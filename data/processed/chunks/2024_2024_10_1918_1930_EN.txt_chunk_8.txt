The situation therein was also governed by Section 10(1) and hence, it was rightly held that the State Government is divested of all its rights and a relationship of lessor and lessee does not continue between the State and the Central Government (or for that matter the petitioner-company). 16. There is another of this Court in Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. v. State of Odisha7 that was placed before us during the course of arguments. However, since in the said , the dispute was with regards to the payment of premium and compensation, as opposed to the demand for “lease rent” in our case, the , being distinguishable on facts, is not applicable to the case at hand. Moreover, in the said case, the right of the State Government to claim compensation/premium under section 18A of the CBA, 1957, was recognized by virtue of State Government being a “person interested” under Section 2(d) of the Act. Herein, there arises no 7 [2023] 1 SCR 1055 : (2023) 4 SCC 343 1930 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports question of an “interested person”. The said did not delve into the question at hand currently, that is the distinction between the nature of right acquired under Section 11(1) and (2), and there was no discussion whether there was a pre-existing mining lease at the time of acquisition or vesting of rights or not. Hence, the said , is clearly distinguishable on facts. 17. Lastly, we also observe that the State Government has raised multiple contentions that no prior consultation of the State Government was made for the transfer or acquisition of the reserved forest block in question under CBA, 1957. The said contention is unfounded in view of notification dated 23.12.1980 under Section 7, declaration dated 17.11.1981 under Section 9, Gazette publication dated 05.12.1981 under Section 10 and Government dated 02.11.1982 under Section 11 of the CBA, 1957 which were never challenged by the State Government for any infirmity. Therefore, this contention is of no avail to the Appellant-State now. 18. Having held that the State Government’s demand for “lease rent” was not supported by any statutory provision, such a demand cannot be sustained in law. The appeal is accordingly dismissed, albeit for reasons different than the one provided by the High Court in the impugned . 19. There shall be no as to costs. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
