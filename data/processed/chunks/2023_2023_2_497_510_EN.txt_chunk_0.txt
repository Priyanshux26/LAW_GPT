[2023] 2 S.C.R. 497 497 SANWARLAL AGRAWAL & ORS. A v. ASHOK KUMAR KOTHARI & ORS. (Civil Appeal No(s). 1312-13 of 2023) FEBRUARY 21, 2023 B [KRISHNA MURARI AND S. RAVINDRA BHAT, JJ.] Decree – Execution of – Expansion of decree – Impermissibility of – Parties entered into a joint venture agreement for a project – Each party brought in 10 crores as loans to finance the project – C Respondents bid for the entire 50% shareholding of the appellants for consideration of 36.75 crores which was accepted, reduced in writing by way of email dtd. 28.03.19 – However, disagreement arose as to whether this amount was inclusive of the loan of 10 crores – Suit filed by respondents for declaration that the agreement dtd. 28.03.19 was binding on the appellants and for specific D performance – Decree on admission passed – In execution proceedings, Single Judge construed the decree by looking into the pleadings and held that 36.75 crores was inclusive of the loan amount – Upheld by Division Bench – Held: An Executing Court can construe a decree if it is ambiguous – However, in the present E case, this cannot result in additions (to the terms of the consent, embodied in the email dtd. 28.03.19) which were not agreed upon by the parties, since the decree was drawn on by consent of both parties at admissions stage itself – There was a clear lack of consensus on the inclusion of the loan amount into the agreement consideration – Both the Courts have, by selectively perusing the F emails, altered the terms of the decree to include the loan amount into the agreement consideration – Impugned set aside – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – XII, r.6. Allowing the appeals, the Court G HELD: The decree awarded (on agreement by both parties) captures, in essence, parts (A) to (D) of the prayer made by the Respondents in their suit. They are analogous to the terms of the agreement dated 28.03.2019, which allude only to the ‘sale of the 50% shareholding of the defendants’ (i.e., of the appellants), and do not mention anything separately regarding the outstanding H 497 498 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A loan amount. The single judge has described the decree as ‘ambiguous’ simply on the absence of its engagement with the loan amount, and proceeded to go behind it by looking into the pleadings (of only the respondents, as appellants had not filed any – which has been adversely inferred by the Court) – and relied on the term, ‘free of all claims of the defendants’ contained in the B decree, to enlarge its scope to include the contested amount. Affirming the same, the Division Bench of the High Court has laid emphasis on the exchange of emails pursuant to the one containing the agreement, especially the email dated 29.03.2019 sent by Respondents outlining the break-up of the amount for C the first time, which was expressly rejected by appellants in their response dated 11.04.2019.
