It is further observed that the role of the NCLT under Section 140(5) is only to examine the need to change a company’s auditor and not to punish or debar the auditor. It is submitted that rejecting the Ministry’s submission that the NCLT can pass an F to debar an auditor for 5 years under section 140(5) of the Act, the High Court has held that the NCLT’s under section 140(5) can only be for change of auditor of the company. It is further observed and held that the consequences of debarment in the second proviso automatically follow upon such change and NCLT does not have any discretion in it. G iii) It is submitted that before the High Court, the BSR also challenged two s of the NCLT, namely, dated 09.08.2019 and dated 18.10.2019. Both these s were passed by the NCLT purportedly under section 140(5) of the Act in proceedings commenced pursuant to the Ministry’s sanction H UNION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER V. DELOITTE HASKINS 987 AND SELLS LLP [M. R. SHAH, J.] and directions dated 29.05.2019 under section 212 of the Act. It is A submitted that BSR had also challenged the jurisdiction of NCLT to pass s under section 140(5) of the Act, 2013. It is submitted that the NCLT has not determined the merits of a section 140(5) and the NCLT in its first has only upheld the maintainability of section 140(5) proceedings. It is submitted that B therefore the submissions on behalf of the respondents do not go into the merits at all. iv) Now so far as on interpretation and applicability of section 140(5) of the Act, 2013, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective respondents – original writ petitioners has taken us C to the scheme of regulation of Auditors under the Companies Act and has taken us to the various provisions relating to the regulation of Auditors under the Companies Act, more particularly Sections 132, 141, 147, 245, 447 and Sections 435 to 438 of the Companies Act. It is submitted that the Act provides a holistic scheme for regulation and punishment of Auditors, all of which have been D different functions and purpose and with such matrix of sections, no auditor can get away with fraud, abetment of fraud, professional misconduct etc. It is submitted that therefore no auditor can escape by way of resignation or termination of tenure due to efflux of time. E v) It is submitted that a plain reading of Section 140 as a whole shows: i. Section 140(1) of the Act deals with the procedure for voluntary auditor by a company. ii. 140(2) and (3) deal with the procedure for resignation F of an auditor. iii. Section 140(4) deals with special notice. Section 140(5) deals with involuntary removal by of NCLT. iv. The heading of Section 140 of the Act (i.e., “Removal, G resignation of auditor and giving of special notice”) makes it clear that Section 140(5) only serves the purpose of removal of an auditor and is not a standalone substantive provision to disqualify auditors.
