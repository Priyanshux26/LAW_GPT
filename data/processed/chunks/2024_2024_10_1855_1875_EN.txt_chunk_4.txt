Respondents also admitted the share of the appellants in plot Nos. 94, 95, 96, 99, 100 etc. to the extent of 1/12. Thus, according to the Consolidation Officer, in view of the admission made by the respondents, Zahoor Ahmed was the co-tenant and that the dispute was only regarding his share. Further, the Consolidation Officer remarked that the onus was on the respondent to prove that they were entitled to 11/12 share of the land.

The Khasra for the relevant years indicated that Zahoor was all along in occupation of the above lands; his name was recorded over an area of 3 bighas 10 biswas of lands and he also paid land revenue in respect of which large number of revenue receipts were on record. Thus, the Consolidation Officer concluded that the lands were acquired jointly when Zahoor Ahmed was a minor and his share would be half of the land. Therefore, he was entitled to half share in Khata Nos. 98 and 99. In so far plot No. 115 of Khata No. 100 is concerned, it was held that the same remained the exclusive property of the respondents. The Consolidation Officer declared that Zahoor Ahmed being the co-tenant of Khata No. 99 was entitled to half share thereof.
