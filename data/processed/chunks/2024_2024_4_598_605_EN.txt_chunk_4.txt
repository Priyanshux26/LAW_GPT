BMC would be bound as an allottee of the State to utilise the said land for the purpose for which it was given. It ought to have taken appropriate steps for removal of possession of the plaintiff which under law was totally unauthorised and illegal. 6. A perusal of the agreement dated 30.07.1991 clearly mentions that the plaintiff was claiming right under the ex-parte decree dated 22.06.1990 and the dismissal of the First Appeal on 11.05.1991. Later on when both the s had been set aside and the suit itself was to proceed from the stage of the Appellant-State filing its written statement, the agreement itself would not have any sanctity in the eye of law even inter se parties. The right created in the plaintiff under the ex-parte decree stood extinguished and, therefore, BMC ought to have been careful enough of not placing any reliance any further on the said agreement. The Trial Court was justified in allowing the application by setting aside the award. The High Court committed a grave error in not considering the relevant aspects and in placing reliance on the statement made by the Appellant- State before the Trial Court that the State had no interest inasmuch as it had allotted the land to BMC to set up a bus stand and therefore, it should be deleted from the array of parties as defendant no.2. In any case, all the applications are still pending before the Trial Court if not already disposed off or withdrawn by the State. 7. In view of the above, the appeal deserves to be allowed and is accordingly allowed. The impugned passed by the High Court is set aside. [2024] 4 S.C.R. 605 The State of Madhya Pradesh v.
