The Assessing Officer (AO) vide dated 30.03.2005 for assessment year (AY) 2002-03 held that the contract of coating of pipes is not a civil works contract and therefore, the composition amount is payable not at the rate of 2% as deposited by the respondent but it E falls under Residuary Entry-8 to the notification dated 18.10.1993.

Before the High Court, the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the assessee fairly conceded that looking to the fact that the authority has passed the assessment on the basis of material available with it, they were required to pay the tax on the basis of 12% and that has been paid by the assessee since the opinion of the expert B was turned out, however, the respondent – assessee restricted the appeal to the extent of challenging the levy of penalty and interest only by submitting that the assessee was under a bonafide belief that the works contract of the assessee would fall under Entry-1 requiring payment of tax at the rate of 2% only. Reliance was placed on the decision of the C High Court in the case of Brooke Bond India Limited Vs. State of Gujarat; 1998 JX (Guj) 128and it was prayed that the imposition of penalty and interest not be upheld. By the impugned and , the High Court has set aside the penalty and interest on the ground that the assessee was under the bonafide opinion and following the advice, paid the tax at 2% and that thereafter, when the enhanced tax as imposed D has already been paid by the assessee, the penalty and interest is not required to be paid by the assessee. The High Court allowed the appeal to the aforesaid extent, deleting the penalty and interest levied under Section 45(6) and Section 47 (4A) of the Act, 1969.
