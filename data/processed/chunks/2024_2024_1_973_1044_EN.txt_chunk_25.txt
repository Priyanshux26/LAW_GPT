The power to legislate has not been conferred on the courts.” 1010 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 11. Similarly in Ajaib Singh v. Sirhind Coop. Marketing-cum- Processing Service Society Ltd. [(1999) 6 SCC 82 : 1999 SCC (L&S) 1054 : AIR 1999 SC 1351], this Court held that the court cannot fix a period of limitation, if not fixed by the legislature, as “the courts can admittedly interpret the law and do not make laws”. The court cannot interpret the statutory provision in such a manner “which would amount to legislation intentionally left over by the legislature”. 12. A similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Union of India v. Assn. for Democratic Reforms [(2002) 5 SCC 294 : AIR 2002 SC 2112] observing that the court cannot issue direction to the legislature for amending the Act or Rules. It is for Parliament to amend the Act or Rules. In District Mining Officer v. Tisco [(2001) 7 SCC 358], this Court held that function of the court is only to expound the law and not to legislate. 13. Similarly, in Supreme Court Employees’ Welfare Assn. v. Union of India [(1989) 4 SCC 187 : 1989 SCC (L&S) 569], this Court held that the court cannot direct the legislature to enact a particular law for the reason that under the constitutional scheme Parliament exercises sovereign power to enact law and no outside power or authority can issue a particular piece of legislation. (See also State of J&K v. A.R. Zakki [1992 Supp (1) SCC 548 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 427 : (1992) 20 ATC 285 : AIR 1992 SC 1546] .) 14. In Union of India v. Prakash P. Hinduja [(2003) 6 SCC 195 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 1314 : AIR 2003 SC 2612], this Court held that if the court issues a direction which amounts to legislation and is not complied with by the State, it cannot be held that the State has committed the contempt of court for the reason that the passed by the court was without jurisdiction and it has no competence to issue a direction amounting to legislation. 15. The issue involved herein was considered by this Court in University of Kerala v. Council of Principals of Colleges [(2010) 1 SCC 353 : AIR 2010 SC 2532] . The Court elaborately explained the scope of separation of powers of different organs of the State under our Constitution; the validity of judicial legislation and if it is at all permissible, its limits; and the validity of judicial activism and the need for judicial restraint, etc. The Court observed : (SCC p. 361, para 13) [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1011 The State of Himachal Pradesh and Others v. Yogendera Mohan Sengupta and Another “13. … ‘19. At the outset, we would say that it is not possible for this Court to give any directions for amending the Act or the statutory rules. It is for Parliament to amend the Act and the rules.’ [Ed. : As observed in Union of India v. Assn.
