Both parents share the duty of ensuring the daughter’s well-being and future security, and this financial provision will contribute to fulfilling that duty. 39. In granting permanent alimony and financial support, this Court is mindful of the principles laid down in Rajnesh vs. Neha.12 The factors to be considered while awarding maintenance or alimony include the duration of the marriage, the earning capacities of the parties, 11 [2024] 7 SCR 942 : (2024) SCC OnLine SC 1724 12 [2020] 13 SCR 1093 : (2021) 2 SCC 324 768 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports their age and health, their standard of living, and their financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage. Here, the appellant has spent substantial time during the pendency of the litigation without the emotional or financial support of the respondent. Moreover, granting a lumpsum as permanent alimony ensures finality and reduces the scope for future litigation between the parties. While the appellant is presumably capable of earning, she has undoubtedly faced financial and emotional setbacks due to the prolonged litigation and separation. Similarly, the financial provision for the daughter ensures her welfare is not compromised due to the breakdown of the marital relationship between her parents. 40. For the reasons stated above, this Court directs the respondent husband to pay a sum of Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs only) to the appellant as permanent alimony and an additional Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs only) to their daughter for her education and future expenses, such as her marriage. These payments shall be made within four months from the date of this . 41. Consequently, the appeal is dismissed, the decree of divorce is upheld, and the maintenance amount above granted is directed to be paid by the respondent to the appellant and their daughter within the time specified above. 42. There shall be no (s) as to costs. Result of the Case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
