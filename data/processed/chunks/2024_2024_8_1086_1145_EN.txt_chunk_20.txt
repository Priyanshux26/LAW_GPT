23. Section 18 of the Act, 1989 which makes the remedy of anticipatory bail unavailable in cases falling under the Act, 1989 reads thus: “18. Section 438 of the Code not to apply to persons committing an offence under the Act.— 1116 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Nothing in Section 438 of the Code shall apply in relation to any case involving the arrest of any person on an accusation of having committed an offence under this Act.” 24. It is manifest from a plain reading of Section 18 referred to above that it bars the applicability of Section 438 of the CrPC in respect of offences under the Act, 1989. The legislature in its wisdom thought fit that the benefit of anticipatory bail should not be made available to the accused in respect of offences under the Act, 1989, having regard to the prevailing social conditions which give rise to such offences and the apprehension that the perpetrators of such atrocities are likely to threaten and intimidate the victims and prevent or obstruct them in the prosecution of such offences, if they are allowed to avail the benefit of anticipatory bail. 25. The constitutional validity of Section 18 of the Act, 1989 fell for the consideration of this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Ram Krishna Balothia reported in (1995) 3 SCC 221. The challenge essentially was on the following two grounds: a. Section 18 is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution as the benefit of Section 438 of the CrPC is available to an accused for offences under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”) but the same is not available for offences under the Act, 1989. b. Section 18 is also violative of Article 21 of the Constitution which protects the life and personal liberty of every person in this country. 26. The Respondents in the aforesaid case had filed writ petitions before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, challenging the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Act, 1989. Although the High Court negatived some part of the challenge, yet it held that Section 18 of the Act, 1989 was unconstitutional as it was violative of Articles 14 and 21 respectively of the Constitution of India. 27. The aforesaid decision of the High Court was challenged before this Court which allowed the appeals and held that Section 18 of the Act, 1989 cannot be considered as violative of Articles 14 and 21 respectively of the Constitution. It was held that the offences enumerated under the Act, 1989 fall into a separate and special category. The Court considered Article 17 of the Constitution which expressly deals with abolition of “untouchability” and forbids its practice in any form and took the view that the offences enumerated under [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1117 Shajan Skaria v. The State of Kerala & Anr. Section 3(1) of the Act, 1989 arise out of the practice of “untouchability”. Having regard to the same, it was held that Section 18 of the Act, 1989 does not violate Article 14 of the Constitution in any manner.
