The instant appeal has been preferred by the accused appellants questioning the legality and validity of the dated 6th April, 2023 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad rejecting the Criminal Appeal No. 3107/2023 preferred by the accused appellants under Section 14A(1) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989(hereinafter being referred to as the ‘SC/ST Act’). The learned appellate Court affi rmed the dated 14th March, 2023 passed by the learned Special Judge SC/ST(PoA) Act, Hathras in Session Case No. 228/2021, rejecting the application for discharge fi led by the accused appellants under Section 227 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973(hereinafter being referred to as the ‘CrPC’) and directing framing of charges against them for the off ences punishable under Sections 147, 148, 149, 307, 323, 504 of Indian Penal Code, 1860(hereinafter being referred to as the ‘IPC’) and Section 3(2)(v)of the SC/ST Act. By the said , the learned Special Judge also directed that the accused appellants shall remain present in the Court on the appointed date. 3. It may be mentioned that vide dated 19th May 2023, this Court had directed that the bonds executed by the accused appellants in pursuance of the dated 2ndSeptember, 2022 passed by the High Court shall remain in force and non-bailable warrants which had been issued at that stage, shall not be executed until further consideration. 4. Learned senior counsel for the appellants, at the outset, conceded that so far as the off ences punishable under IPC are concerned, the prayer for discharge would require extensive evaluation of evidence and hence, he gave up the challenge made on behalf of the accused appellants to the framing charges qua these off ences. However, the fervent contention of learned senior counsel was that the ingredients of Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act are not prima facie made out against the accused appellants from the admitted allegations of the prosecution and hence, the accused appellants deserve indulgence of this Court and the impugned s are liable to be interfered with to this extent. 107 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 5. Learned senior counsel contended that for the off ence under Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act to be made out, there must be a specifi c allegation of the prosecution that the accused committed an off ence punishable under the provisions of the IPC against a member of the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe knowing that the victim belongs to such community.
