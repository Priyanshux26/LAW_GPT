Apart from the above, we may also refer to Section 164 of the Companies Act which sets forth various disqualifications for appointment of directors. It also provides that if a person fails to repay deposits accepted by the company of which he is a director, and failure to repay the due amount has continued for one year or more, he shall not be eligible for reappointment as director of that company or appointed in D any other company for a period of five years from the date on which the said company fails to do so. Moreover, in view of the submissions made, a reference to Section 166(4) of the Companies Act shall also be apposite. The relevant parts of the aforementioned provisions would read as under:- “Section 164. Disqualifications for appointment of E director.— *** *** *** (2) No person who is or has been a director of a company which— (a) has not filed financial statements or annual returns for any F continuous period of three financial years; or (b) has failed to repay the deposits accepted by it or pay interest thereon or to redeem any debentures on the due date or pay interest due thereon or pay any dividend declared and such failure to pay or redeem continues for one year or more, G shall be eligible to be re-appointed as a director of that company or appointed in other company for a period of five years from the date on which the said company fails to do so.
