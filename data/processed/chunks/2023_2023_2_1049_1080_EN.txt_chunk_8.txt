5.1. On 12.09.2008, the High Court disposed of W.P. (C) No. 1951 of 2002 with the observations, inter alia, that the said petitioners H 1060 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A having retired long back and there being no provision for pension in their service conditions, no directions could be issued qua them for payment of any pension. However, in view of the pendency of other writ petition, the High Court provided that the claim of the said petitioners will be subject to the result of the other writ petition filed by the employees who were in service. B 5.2. Thereafter, the said other writ petition, being W.P. (C) No. 14729 of 2007, was disposed of by the High Court on 25.11.2008, with direction to the appellant State to reconsider the matter and to take the decision expeditiously. The High Court observed and directed as under:- C “3. No Counter Affidavit has been filed by the State.

(C) No. 8438 of 2010, was filed by respondent No. 1 (an association of the employees of the Board) on 04.05.2010 with the following prayers: - “Under the circumstances, it is humbly requested that the Hon’ble H Court be pleased to issue a writ in the nature of mandamus or any STATE OF ORISSA v.
