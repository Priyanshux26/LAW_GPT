[Para 19] Jurisprudence – Criminal Jurisprudence – Essence of liberty – Presumption of innocence: 124 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: Criminal jurisprudence emphasises on the fundamental essence of liberty and presumption of innocence unless proven guilty – This presumption gets emboldened by virtue of concurrent findings of acquittal – Therefore, this court must be extra cautious while dealing with a challenge against acquittal as the said presumption gets reinforced by virtue of a well-reasoned favourable outcome – Consequently, the onus on the prosecution side becomes more burdensome pursuant to the said double presumption. [Para 31(i)] Criminal Law – Where two views are possible – Concurrent findings of acquittal: Held: Where two views are possible, then this Court would not ordinarily interfere and reverse the concurrent findings of acquittal – However, where the situation is such that the only conclusion which could be arrived at from a comprehensive appraisal of evidence, shows that there has been a grave miscarriage of justice, then, notwithstanding such concurrent view, this Court would not restrict itself to adopt an oppugnant view. [State of Uttar Pradesh v. Dan Singh]. [Para 31(iii)] Criminal Law – Concurrent findings favoring accused – When interference required: Held: In situations of concurrent findings favoring accused, interference is required where the trial court adopted an incorrect approach in framing of an issue of fact and the appellate court whilst affirming the view of the trial court, lacked in appreciating the evidence produced by the accused in rebutting a legal presumption. [Rajesh Jain v. Ajay Singh] – Furthermore, such interference is necessitated to safeguard interests of justice when the acquittal is based on some irrelevant grounds or fallacies in re-appreciation of any fundamental evidentiary material or a manifest error of law or in cases of non-adherence to the principles of natural justice or the decision is manifestly unjust or where an acquittal which is fundamentally based on an exaggerated adherence to the principle of granting benefit of doubt to the accused, is liable to be set aside – Say in cases where the court severed the connection between accused and criminality committed by him upon a cursory examination of evidences.
