[Paras 51, 52, 55, 58, 59, 61] [2024] 12 S.C.R. 135 M/s HPCL Bio-Fuels Ltd. v. M/s Shahaji Bhanudas Bhad Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Limitation Act, 1963 – s.14 – Whether the fresh application u/s.11(6) of the Act, 1996 filed by the respondent on 09.12.2022 could be said to be time-barred – If yes, whether the respondent is entitled to the benefit of s.14 of the Limitation Act: Held: The first application u/s.11(6) filed on 16.02.2018 was well within the prescribed limitation period of three years for filing such applications – The second application u/s.11(6) was required to be filed within a period of three years from the expiry of one month from the date of receipt of the notice invoking arbitration by the appellant – This period of three years came to an end in August, 2019 – The second application u/s.11(6) came to be filed by the respondent much later on 12.12.2022 and is clearly time-barred – As far as benefit of s.14 of the Limitation Act is concerned, there is a body of decisions of this Court taking the view that by virtue of s.43 of the Act, 1996, the Limitation Act is applicable to applications for appointment of arbitrator filed u/s.11(6) of the said Act – It thus follows that the benefit u/s.14 of the Limitation Act can be availed by an applicant subject to the fulfilment of the conditions specified therein – First, the benefit of s.14(1) can be availed of where the subsequent proceeding is a suit, whereas the benefit of s.14(2) can be availed of where the subsequent proceeding is an application – Secondly, s.14(1) applies if both the earlier and the subsequent proceedings have the same matter in issue, whereas s.14(2) applies when both the earlier and the subsequent proceedings are filed for seeking the same relief – As a petition u/s.11(6) of the Act, 1996 is not a suit, hence it would not be governed by sub-section (1) of s.14 of the Limitation Act – Instead, it would be governed by sub-section (2) of s.14 of the Limitation Act – As far as same relief is concerned, the High Court fell in error in holding that an application u/s.9 of the IBC and an application u/s.11(6) of the Act, 1996 are filed for seeking the same relief – While the relief sought in the former is the initiation of the CIRP of the corporate debtor, the relief sought in the latter is the appointment of an arbitrator for the adjudication of disputes arising out of a contract – As the relief sought in an application u/s.11(6) of the Act, 1996 is not the same as the relief sought in an application u/s.9 of the IBC, the benefit of s.14(2) cannot be given to the respondent in the present case.
