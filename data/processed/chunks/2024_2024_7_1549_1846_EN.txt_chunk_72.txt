As the object of a tax is not to confer any special benefit upon any particular individual, there is, as it is said, no element of quid pro quo between the taxpayer and the public authority. Another feature of taxation is that as it is a part of the common burden, the quantum of imposition upon the taxpayer depends generally upon his capacity to pay.” 104. A tax has the following essential characteristics: (i) it is a compulsory exaction of money by a public authority; (ii) it is imposed under statutory power without the consent of the tax payer; (iii) the demand is enforceable by law; (iv) it is an imposition made for public purposes to meet the general expenses of the state without reference to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax; and (v) it is part of the common burden.149 105. Article 366(28) defines “taxation” to include “the imposition of any tax or impost, whether general or local or special.” This Court has interpreted the word “tax” in its widest amplitude to include all money raised by taxation.150 In Jindal Stainless Steel (supra), one of us (Justice D Y Chandrachud) held that the expression “any tax” means “any levy which the State is constitutionally competent to legislate.”151 106. One of the issues debated in the reference pertains to the meaning of the word “impost.” Thomas Cooley in the Law of Taxation defines “imposts” to mean “any tax, tribute, or duty.”152 This Court has generally construed the expression “imposts” to include taxes153 and fees154 149 See Mahant Sri Jagannath Ramanuj Das v. State of Orissa (1954) 1 SCC 455 [11] 150 D G Gose and Co. (Agents) (P) Ltd. v.

M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. realizable by the authority of law.155 In CIT v. McDowell and Co. Ltd.,156 this Court held that the term “impost” means compulsory levy and that “tax” in its wider sense includes all imposts.157 In McDowell (supra), the assesse sought to claim a deduction under Section 43- B(a) of the Income Tax Act 1961 on the payment of bottling fees made to the State Government under the Rajasthan Excise Act 1950. Section 43-B(a) allowed a deduction in respect of any sum payable by the assessee by way of tax, duty, cess or fee, by whatever name called, under any law for the time being in force. The issue before the two-Judge Bench was whether bottling fees chargeable from the assessee amounted to a tax, duty, cess, or fee.
