The relevant parts of the are extracted hereinbelow: “27. Hence, the question would be, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, what is the date, on which, the repayment is due. As we have mentioned [2024] 5 S.C.R. 397 Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v. M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited earlier, the case on hand is very peculiar and appears to have not arisen in any of the earlier litigations and therefore, it requires to be dealt with in a different manner and obviously on such a reasoning, any observation or direction, which we may issue in this , cannot be treated as a precedent. 28. As mentioned above, the appellant was de-registered by the BIFR on February 5, 2013. The first demand notice was issued on March 20, 2013. However, the appellant paid the dues only on April 25, 2015. The question would be, in the facts and circumstances, what would be the date, on which, the repayment of the loan is due. 29. The Department’s contention is that it should be the date, on which, the default occurred. If that is to be reckoned as the date, then an of cancellation of the agreement followed by recovery proceedings should have been taken by the Department, which admittedly has not been done. This is presumably for the reason that from 2003 to 2013, the appellant was before the Board and it was declared as a sick industrial company and in terms of section 22 of the SICA, the respondent-Department was prohibited from proceeding with any recovery against the appellant and this is a statutory prohibition, which binds the respondent-Department. 30. From the representation given by the appellant to the Government dated August 5, 2014, we find that the Sales Tax Department did not appear before the Board on several dates when the case was heard. Be that as it may, the due date for repayment could have never occurred, in the facts and circumstances, between August 1, 2003 when the appellant was referred to the BIFR and May 31, 2006, the appellant was declared as a sick industrial company till its net worth turned positive and it was discharged from the Board on February 5, 2013. 31. Thus, on facts, we hold that the date, on which, the repayment became due for the appellant’s case shall be fixed on February 6, 2013. Admittedly, the appellant cleared the entire sales tax on April 25, 2015. Hence, for 398 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the period from February 6, 2013 to April 25, 2015, the appellant is liable to pay interest.” (Emphasis supplied) 140. For the period during which the defendant company was sick and before the BIFR, it cannot be said that the withholding of the payment of the dues of the original plaintiff was wilful and intentional. We say so because first, the liability of the original defendants was disputed and was finally adjudicated only by way of the impugned , much after the BIFR proceedings had come to an end; and secondly, even if the liability of the original defendants was not disputed, or was even acknowledged before the BIFR, recovery of the same could not have been done without the permission of the BIFR in view of the suspension of recovery proceedings by Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.
