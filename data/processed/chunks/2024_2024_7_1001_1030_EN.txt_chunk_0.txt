Viswanathan, JJ.] Issue for Consideration (i) Whether the respondents-landowners forestalled their right to challenge the acquisition proceeding on the ground of non-compliance of Section 5A, Land Acquisition Act, 1894 because they have not filed objections; or they were not tenure holders as per the revenue records on the date of notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act; or after submitting their objections, they have accepted compensation without any demur; (ii) If the answer to the aforementioned question is in negative, whether the mandatory procedure contemplated under Section 5A has been complied with in the instant case. Headnotes† Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – s.5A – Compliance with – Writ petitions were filed by the respondents-land owners challenging the acquisition proceedings on the ground of non-compliance of the procedure prescribed u/s.5A – Respondents claimed being unaware of the acquisition proceedings stating that they were not served with notices for hearings – High Court quashed the notification issued u/s.6(1) and annulled the land acquisition proceedings initiated by the appellant – Correctness: Held: The person who submits objections u/s.5A must be accorded an opportunity of personal hearing – Such a hearing must precede with an advance notice served upon the objector – The failure to serve the notice would be sufficient to infer the defiance of s.5A – However, whether or not an advance notice of hearing was served upon an “objector” is a question of fact – Where the Collector takes a specific stand that notices were duly served upon the persons concerned and the record of service of such notices has been duly maintained, the statutory presumption inscribed u/s.114, Evidence * Author 1002 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Act shall be drawn, wherein the Court may presume the existence of facts, including “that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed” – The rule of statutory presumption is a well-rooted principle in Common Law and founded upon the dictum ‘omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta’, namely, that the act can be presumed to have been rightly and regularly done – The Court would presume that the official act was done rightly and effectively and the burden to prove contrary lies on the party who disputes the sanctity of such act – Thus, the onus lay on the landowners to demonstrate that the issuance or service of notices was inefficacious, which they failed to discharge given their presence at the time of hearings,as per the official record – Landowners were thus, duly served and the procedure as mandated by s.5A was substantially complied with – Impugned of the High Court as well as all other s following the said , set aside – Writ petitions filed by the respondents dismissed. [Paras 38-41, 56] Maxim – ‘Omnia Consensus Tollit Errorem’ – Applicability – Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – ss.5A, 6 – “person interested”; “objector” – Challenge to acquisition proceedings even by the respondents-landowners who did not file objections – High Court quashed the entire declaration issued u/s.6 and annulled the land acquisition proceedings initiated by the appellant: Held: s.5A(1) gives a “person interested” the right to file objections, s.5A(2) affords only an “objector” the right to be heard – A person cannot claim hearing as a matter of right u/s.5A(2) unless he has filed objections – High Court erred while allowing the claim of even those landowners who did not invoke their remedy u/s.
