It was held that the word “acts” used in Rule 2 of 3 CPC does not include the act of power-of-attorney holder to appear as a witness on behalf of a party. Power-of-attorney holder of a party can appear only as a witness in his personal capacity and whatever knowledge he has about the case he can state on oath but he cannot appear as a witness on behalf of the party in the capacity of that party. If the plaintiff is unable to appear in the court, a commission for recording his evidence may be issued under the relevant provisions of CPC. 19. In the case of Pradeep Mohanbay (Dr.) v. Minguel Carlos Dias [(2000) 1 Bom LR 908] the Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court held that a power of attorney can file a complaint under Section 138 but cannot depose on behalf of the complainant. He can only appear as a witness. 622 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 20. However, in the case of Humberto Luis v. Floriano Armando Luis [(2002) 2 Bom CR 754] on which reliance has been placed by the Tribunal in the present case, the High Court took a dissenting view and held that the provisions contained in 3 Rule 2 CPC cannot be construed to disentitle the power-of-attorney holder to depose on behalf of his principal. The High Court further held that the word “act” appearing in 3 Rule 2 CPC takes within its sweep “depose”. We are unable to agree with this view taken by the Bombay High Court in Floriano Armando [(2002) 2 Bom CR 754] . 21. We hold that the view taken by the Rajasthan High Court in the case of Shambhu Dutt Shastri [(1986) 2 WLN 713 (Raj)] followed and reiterated in the case of Ram Prasad [AIR 1998 Raj 185 : (1998) 3 Cur CC 183] is the correct view. The view taken in the case of Floriano Armando Luis [(2002) 2 Bom CR 754] cannot be said to have laid down a correct law and is accordingly overruled. 22. In the view that we have taken, we hold that the appellants have failed to discharge the burden that they have contributed towards the purchase of property at 38, Koregaon Park, Pune from any independent source of income and failed to prove that they were co-owners of the property at 38, Koregaon Park, Pune. This being the core question, on this score alone, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.” 10. Thereafter, in Man Kaur vs. Hartar Singh Sangha3, this Court referred to its earlier decisions including Janki Vashdeo Bhojwani (supra) and concluded thus in paras 17 & 18: “17. To succeed in a suit for specific performance, the plaintiff has to prove: (a) that a valid agreement of sale was entered into by the defendant in his favour and the terms thereof; (b) that the defendant committed breach of the contract; and (c) that he was always ready and willing to perform his part of the obligations in terms of the 3 [2010] 12 SCR 515 : 2010 (10) SCC 512 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
