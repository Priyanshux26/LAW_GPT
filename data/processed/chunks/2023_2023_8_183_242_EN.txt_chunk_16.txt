Being aggrieved thereby, the Rajasthan Discoms have approached this Court. B 40. We have heard Mr. V. Giri, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Rajasthan Discoms and Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the APRL. 41. Mr. V. Giri submits that clause 10 in the PPA is referable only C to taxes under Article 268 of the Constitution of India. He submits that the learned APTEL has, therefore, erred in allowing ‘Change in Law’ benefits on the issues related to Busy Season Surcharge, Development Surcharge, Port Congestion Charges, Forest Tax and Carrying Cost which are not taxes referable to Article 268 of the Constitution. D 42. Dr. Singhvi made arguments on similar lines as have been made in the other appeals. Civil Appeal Nos. 2935-2936 of 2020 43. These appeals have been filed by the Rajasthan Discoms and E Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. challenging the common and dated 29th January 2020, passed by the learned APTEL in Appeal no.284 of 2017 and Appeal No. 09 of 2018. 44.

As stated above, being aggrieved by that part of the which disallowed its claim, APRL preferred the aforesaid Appeal before the learned APTEL, whereas the Rajasthan Discoms, being aggrieved by that part of the which allowed claims on certain components, also filed an Appeal before the learned APTEL. G 47. The learned APTEL, while dismissing the appeal of the Rajasthan Discoms, partly allowed the appeal of the APRL by allowing compensation on certain other components on the ground of ‘Change in Law’. H GMR WARORA ENERGY LTD. v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY 209 REGULATORY COMMISSION (CERC) [B. R. GAVAI, J.] 48.
