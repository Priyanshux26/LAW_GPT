Case Arising From CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 12993 of 2024 From the and dated 12.11.2020 of the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in MFA No. 2573 of 2016 Appearances for Parties Rohan Thawani, Ms. Pooja Dhar, Advs. for the Appellant. T. Mahipal, Rohit Kumar Sinha, Sanjay Kumar Singh, Advs. for the Respondents. 838 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports / of the Supreme Court Sanjay Karol, J. Leave granted. 2. The concept of just compensation rests on the principle of restitutio ad integrum which means restoration to the original condition, as far as possible, taking the person to whom damages are awarded, to a position as if the incident or in this case, the accident, had never occurred. While this is a well-recognized and positive principle of law, we must also recognize its limitations. The award of compensation, however much it may be, does not give back to the person who affected their life but only alleviates the worry of being able to secure the required amenities. 3. In awarding non-pecuniary damages, this Court has often highlighted the difficulty in computation, for there is no manner in which such determination lends itself to formulaic ciphering. Every person in life has undertaken certain steps towards the realization of dreams, held goals and aspirations, and when they land up in such an unfortunate situation, where, for no fault of theirs, the trajectories of their lives are forever altered.
