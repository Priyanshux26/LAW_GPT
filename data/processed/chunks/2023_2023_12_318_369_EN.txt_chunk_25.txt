properly understood the ratio in Citizen Co-operative Society Ltd. Also, an analysis of Section 80P was made particularly of sub-section (4) of the said Section in paragraphs 24 to 24.5 and paragraphs 39 to 43. Paragraphs 24 to 24.5 and paragraphs 39 to 43 are extracted as under: 24. An analysis of this would show that the question of law that was refl ected in para 5 of the was answered in favour of the assessee. The following propositions may be culled out from the in Citizen Coop. Society case: 24.1. That Section 80-P of the IT Act is a benevolent provision, which was enacted by Parliament in to encourage and promote the growth of the co-operative sector generally in the economic life of the country and must, therefore, be read liberally and in favour of the assessee; 24.2. That once the assessee is entitled to avail of deduction, the entire amount of profi ts and gains of business that are attributable to any one or more activities mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 80-P must be given by way of deduction; 24.3. That this Court in Kerala State Coop. Mktg. Federation Ltd. has construed Section 80-P widely and liberally, holding that if a society were to avail of several heads of deduction, and if it fell within any one head of deduction, it would be free from tax notwithstanding that the conditions of another head of deduction are not satisfi ed; 24.4. This is for the reason that when the legislature wanted to restrict the deduction to a particular type of cooperative society, such as is evident from Section 80-P(2)(b) qua milk cooperative societies, the legislature expressly says so — which is not the case with Section 80-P(2)(a)(i) 24.5. That Section 80-P(4) is in the nature of a proviso to the main provision contained in Sections 80-P(1) and (2). This proviso specifi cally excludes only cooperative banks, which are cooperative societies who must possess a licence from RBI to do banking business. Given the fact that the assessee in that case was not so licensed, the assessee would not fall within the mischief of Section 80-P(4). KSCARDB v. THE ASSESSING OFFICER, TRIVANDRUM 357 AND ORS. [B.V. NAGARATHNA, J.] X X X 39. Coming to the provisions of Section 80-P(4), it is important to advert to the speech of the Finance Minister dated 28-2-2006, which refl ects the need for introducing Section 80-P(4). Shri P. Chidambaram specifi cally stated: “166. Cooperative Banks, like any other bank, are lending institutions and should pay tax on their profi ts. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) and Primary Cooperative Agricultural and Rural Development Banks (P56789) stand on a special footing and will continue to be exempt from tax under Section 80-P of the Income Tax Act. However, I propose to exclude all other cooperative banks from the scope of that section.” 40. Likewise, a Circular dated 28-12-2006, containing explanatory notes on provisions contained in the Finance Act, 2006, is also important, and reads as follows: “Withdrawal of tax benefi ts available to certain cooperative banks *** 22.2.
