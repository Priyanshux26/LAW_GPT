4.13.1. Under the JVA/FSA, KECML was required to supply Grade ‘D’ coal to KPCL. As per the Coal Directory of India, 2010-2011, Grade ‘D’ coal in terms of the old grades of non-coking coal would be equivalent to Grade ‘G-7’ and ‘G-8’ under the new grades of non-coking coal. The GCV range in respect of Grade ‘G-7’ coal has been fixed between 5201 Kcal/kg and 5500 Kcal/ kg and in respect of Grade ‘G-8’ coal, between 4901 Kcal/kg and 5200 Kcal/kg. In the instant case, even as per the Report of the CIFMR, Nagpur, the coal rejects were found to be below either of the aforesaid grades of non-coking coal, having been pegged at a GCV of 1094 Kcal/kg. Therefore, it is contended that the chargesheet filed by the respondent-CBI quantifying the loss suffered by KPCL at ₹49,03,54,159/- (Rupees Forty nine crore three lakh fifty four thousand one hundred and fifty nine only), is without any basis and contrary to the records. 4.14. That the Coal Controller did not raise any issue with regard to the disposal of the rejects and the respondent-CBI has neither made the Coal Controller a witness or an accused in the present case. 4.15. The judgements in Radheshyam Kejriwal v. State of West Bengal and Another;54 Ashoo Surendranath Tewari v. 53 In short UHV 54 [2011] 4 SCR 889 : (2011) 3 SCC 581 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1203 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation Deputy Superintendent of Police, EOW, CBI and Another;55 J Sekar alias Sekar Reddy v. Directorate of Enforcement;56 and Prem Raj v. Poonamma Menon & Another 57 have been cited to argue that it is settled law that where a party has been exonerated on merits in civil adjudication, criminal prosecution cannot be permitted to continue on the same set of facts and circumstances. 4.16. That the respondent – CBI has failed to produce any document to demonstrate that the accused Nos.1 to 5 had made any demand for illegal gratification or there was acceptance of any such demand made. In the absence of proof of demand and acceptance of illegal gratification by the public servant, no offence is made out under Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act. For this proposition, reliance has been placed on B. Jayaraj v State of Andhra Pradesh;58 P. Satyanarayana Murthy v District Inspector of Police, State of Andhra Pradesh and Another;59 State through Central Bureau of Investigation v Dr Anup Kumar Srivastava;60 K. Shanthamma v State of Telangana;61 Neeraj Dutta v State (NCT of Delhi);62 Soundarajan v State Rep. by the Inspector of Police Vigilance Anticorruption Dindigul.63 4.17. Lastly, it has been strenuously argued that sanction to prosecute Mr. Yogendra Tripathi and Mr. R. Nagaraja64 having been denied by the Sanctioning Authority i.e. the Board of Directors of KPCL and the CVC and the said s having been upheld by the DoPT and no steps having been taken by the respondent – CBI to challenge the said decision, a different yardstick cannot be adopted in respect of the appellants.
