The subsequent purchaser, even if unaware of the prior sale, cannot be considered bona fide because the vendor no longer had the legal right to sell the property. Thus, the protection afforded by the bona fide purchaser doctrine is nullified by the vendor’s deceitful conduct and the pre-existing transfer of rights. This ensures that the original purchaser’s rights are upheld and prevents unjust enrichment through fraudulent transactions. 36. This is not a case of agreement to sell in favour of appellants but is a case of sale deed transferring ownership rights and possession. It would be open to respondent no.1 to avail such remedy as may be available under law to recover the sale consideration paid by him to respondent No.2. The sale deed in favour of the respondent No.1 dated 03.12.2010 needs to be cancelled and the registering authority be directed to score out the same from the records as directed by the first Appellate Court. 37. Another argument raised that the sale deed did not contain the signatures of the mother also deserves to be rejected. Prior to insertion of section 32A in the Act, 1908 in the year 2001 there was no requirement under law that the vendee must mandatorily sign the document of sale for immovable property and also affix passport size photograph and thumb impression along with proof of identification. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2327 Kaushik Premkumar Mishra & Anr. v. Kanji Ravaria @ Kanji & Anr. In the present case the sale deed was presented for registration in 1985, much before 2001. 38. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior Counsel appearing for Respondent No. 2, has relied upon the following s in to substantiate his arguments pertaining to the issue of registration of the sale deed: a. Raghunath Singh & Ors. v. Kedar Nath,25 b. Bondar Singh & Ors. v. Nihal Singh & Ors.,26 c. Suraj Lamps and Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Haryana and Anr.,27 d. S. Kaladevi v. V.R. Somasundaram & Ors.,28 e. M/s Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. Amit Chand Mitra & Anr.,29 f. Maya Devi v. Lalta Prasad,30 g. Veena Singh (dead) thr. LRs. v. District Registrar/Additional Collector31 39. We observe that the cases relied upon by the Respondent No. 2 do not extend any kind of benefit in the facts of the present case as the s above are clearly distinguishable on facts. Thus, to avoid lending any further burden on the instant , we are not dealing with them on their individual facts. 40. In view of the discussions made above, the appeal deserves to be allowed. The impugned judgement of the High Court is set aside and that of the first Appellate Court decreeing suit of the appellant is restored and maintained. 41. Facts of this case deserves that the suit should be decreed with exemplary costs considering the conduct of the defendant- respondents, which is quantified at Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees ten lakhs only) to be paid to the appellants within eight weeks from today. 25 [1969] 3 SCR 497 : (1969) 1 SCC 497 26 [2003] 2 SCR 564 : (2003)4 SCC 161 27 [2009] 9 SCR 1048 : (2009) 7 SCC 363 28 [2010] 4 SCR 515 : (2010) 5 SCC 401 29 [2023] 14 SCR 28 : SLP (C )No.15774 of 2023 decided on 25.09.2023 30 (2015) 3 SCC 588 31 [2022] 3 SCR 736 : (2022) 7 SCC 1 2328 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
