There was no escape for the NCLAT in this regard. There was no option which was given to the SRA to deviate from this direction which purely stemmed from the Resolution Plan. The fact that this direction was binding was clearly understood by the SRA since it attempted to file another Miscellaneous Application before this Court requesting for an extension to comply with our dated 18.01.2024 which was dismissed as misconceived. 123. There were two other directions which were issued by us in our dated 18.01.2024 i.e., (ii) that the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore shall continue to remain in operation and effect pending the final disposal of the appeal before the NCLAT, and shall abide by the final outcome of the appeal and the directions that may be issued by the NCLAT; and (iii) whether or not the SRA has been compliant with all the conditions of the Resolution Plan as well as of the conditions set out in paragraph 8 of the affidavit dated 16 August 2023 shall be decided by the NCLAT in the pending appeal. These two directions must not be seen as giving any leeway to the NCLAT to act in complete ignorance or defiance of the first direction that was issued by us. Such a selective compliance with our dated 18.01.2024 deserves to be nipped in the bud more particularly when it was mandated that our directions be considered and complied with in its entirety. Therefore, the NCLAT, while finally deciding the pending Company Appeal on merits which led to the impugned dated 12.03.2024 has, either by design or unknowingly, ignored the directions issued by this Court vide dated 18.01.2024 that the remaining amount of Rs. 150 Crore had to be necessarily deposited in cash only. This has resulted in a perverse decision which stands contrary to law and to the terms of the Resolution Plan itself. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2137 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. 124. In view of our crystal clear dated 18.01.2024, we are of the opinion that the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore could not have been allowed to be adjusted with the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore. Non-compliance of the SRA with the of this Court has led to a dereliction of its obligations to implement the Resolution Plan. ii. Whether the non-implementation of the Resolution Plan by the SRA necessarily leads to the consequence of liquidation as under Section 33(3) of the IBC, 2016? 125. In the foregoing paragraphs, we have reached the conclusion that the SRA failed to implement the Resolution Plan by not infusing the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore in cash, as required by Clause 6.3.1(g) and the Implementation Schedule under Clause 7.7 of the Resolution Plan. It is now to be seen if this has resulted in the contravention of other terms of the Resolution Plan as well. a. Whether Respondent No.1/SRA had failed to implement the Resolution Plan on non-payment of the Airport Dues as per the terms of the Resolution Plan?
