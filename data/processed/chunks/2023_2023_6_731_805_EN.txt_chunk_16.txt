On 22 February 2019, the State of Odisha wrote to the Union of India, intimating it that the employees of the OAT would be “suitably adjusted in other heads of the department under the Government of Odisha H ORISSA ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL BAR ASSOCIATION v. 755 UNION OF INDIA [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] depending upon the vacancies in equivalent cadre and post.” The letter A also stated that the State Government had decided to transfer the cases pending before the OAT to the Orissa High Court and that the latter had accepted this decision. 11. The Union Government took recourse to Section 21 of the General Clauses Act 189710 and abolished the OAT by issuing Notification B GSR 552(E) on 2 August 2019. The relevant portion of this notification is extracted below: “Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub- section (2) of Section 4 of the Administrative Tribunals Act 1985, read with Section 21 of the General Clauses Act 1897 (10 of C 1897), the Central Government hereby rescinds the said notification number GSR 934(E), dated the 4th July 1986, except as respects things done or omitted to be done before such rescission, with effect from the date of publication of this notification in the Gazette of India.” D ii. The impugned 12. In 2019, each of the appellants filed a Writ Petition before the Orissa High Court for quashing the notification dated 2 August 2019 (as well as the decision of the Cabinet of the State Government dated 9 September 2015 to abolish the OAT). After considering the rival sub- E missions, the Orissa High Court dismissed the Writ Petitions by its com- mon dated 7 June 2021, for the following reasons: 13. a. Article 323-A is an enabling provision. It does not make it mandatory for the Union Government to establish F administrative tribunals or refrain from abolishing them once they are established; b. The decision to abolish the OAT is an administrative decision. There is therefore no bar to the Union Government invoking Section 21 of the General Clauses Act read with Section 4(2) G of the Administrative Tribunals Act to rescind the notification establishing the OAT; c. The invocation of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act does not result in a denial of justice because the cases pending 10 “General Clauses Act” H 756 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A before the OAT will be heard by the Orissa High Court. Hence, litigants are not prejudiced by the invocation of Section 21; d. The proposition that what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly is not applicable because neither Article 323- A of the Constitution nor Section 4(2) of the Administrative B Tribunals Act prohibits the Union or State Government from abolishing an SAT; e. The Union Government was not rendered functus-officio after it established the OAT because it was exercising an administrative function and not a judicial or quasi-judicial C function; f. The jurisdiction of the Orissa High Court was neither created nor enlarged as a consequence of the notification dated 2 August 2019.
