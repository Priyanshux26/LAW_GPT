25.2. The scope of Section 58(c) of the 1882 Act4 was considered in detail in paras 27 to 33 thereof which are extracted below: “27. A bare perusal of the said provision clearly shows that a mortgage by conditional sale must be evidenced by one document whereas a sale with a condition of retransfer may be evidenced by more than one document. A sale with a condition of retransfer, is not mortgage. It is not a partial transfer. By reason of such a transfer all rights have been transferred reserving only a personal right to the purchaser (sic seller), and such a personal right would be lost, unless the same is exercised within the stipulated time. 28. In Pandit Chunchun Jha v. Sk. Ebadat Ali [(1955) 1 SCR 174 : AIR 1954 SC 345] this Court clearly held: (SCR p. 177) “We think that is a fruitless task because two documents are seldom expressed in identical terms and when it is necessary to consider the attendant circumstances the imponderable variables which that brings in its train make it impossible to compare one case with another. Each must be decided on its own facts.” 1046 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 29. Yet again in Mushir Mohd. Khan v. Sajeda Bano [(2000) 3 SCC 536] this Court upon construing Section 58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act opined: (SCC pp. 541-42, para 9) “9. The proviso to this clause was added by Act 20 of 1929 so as to set at rest the confl ict of decisions on the question whether the conditions, specially the condition relating to reconveyance contained in a separate document could be taken into consideration in fi nding out whether a mortgage was intended to be created by the principal deed. The legislature enacted that a transaction shall not be deemed to be a mortgage unless the condition for reconveyance is contained in the document which purports to eff ect the sale.” 30. Referring to Chunchun Jha [(1955) 1 SCR 174: AIR 1954 SC 345] it was held: (SCC p. 544, para 14) “14. Applying the principles laid down above, the two documents read together would not constitute a ‘mortgage’ as the condition of repurchase is not contained in the same documents by which the property was sold. The proviso to clause (c) of Section 58 would operate in the instant case also and the transaction between the parties cannot be held to be a ‘mortgage by conditional sale’.” 31. In Umabai v. Nilkanth Dhondiba Chavan [(2005) 6 SCC 243] wherein one of us was a party, this Court held: (SCC p. 254, para 21) “21. There exists a distinction between mortgage by conditional sale and a sale with a condition of repurchase. In a mortgage, the debt subsists and a right to redeem remains with the debtor; but a sale with a condition of repurchase is not a lending and borrowing arrangement. There does not exist any debt and no right to redeem is reserved thereby.
