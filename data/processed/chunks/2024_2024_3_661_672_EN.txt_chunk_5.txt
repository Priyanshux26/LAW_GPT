The abovementioned judgements of the High Court had in turn placed reliance on MSA No. 200055/2016 (LAC) titled Malkajappa @ Mallikarjun vs. The Special Land Acquisition Officer & Anr, decided by the High Court on 13.03.2017, which has also been remanded to the High Court vide this Court’s dated 10.05.2022 in Annarao @ Anveerappa case (supra). 10. We find that in the present batch of appeals, the brief impugned passed by the High Court in CA No.4053/2024, has solely relied upon its own decision in Rajshekhar’s case (supra). In some of the other appeals, namely CA Nos. 4954, 4055, 4056, 4064, 4065, 4066, 4067, 4068, 4079, 4080, 4081, 4082, 4083, 4087 and 4088 of 2024, the High Court has relied upon its decision in Malkajappa @ Mallikarjun (supra), Kalappa (supra) (which placed reliance on Malkajappa @ Mallikarjun (supra)) and Motibee (supra)(which placed reliance on Malkajappa @ Mallikarjun (supra)). These s did not find favour with this Court in Annarao @ Anveerappa case (supra), whereby the matters have been remanded to the High Court for reconsideration. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 671 The Executive Engineer, KNNL v. Subhashchandra & Ors. 11. Learned senior counsel for the appellant-Corporation, submits that after the remand, the matter has been heard in part by the High Court. 12. On the other hand, learned senior counsel for the respondents-land owners submits that there are numerous cases in which similarly placed land owners have already been paid compensation at enhanced rate granted by the High Court. Those s of the High Court have attained finality and are not subject matter of these appeals. 13. Learned senior counsel for the appellant(s), however, counters this submission, as according to him, those matters pertain to different villages and the respondents cannot claim parity with those cases. 14. We have considered the rival submissions made by learned senior counsel for the parties. It is not in dispute that a batch of cases has been remanded by this Court for reconsideration by the High Court, as seen above. It is also an admitted fact that those matters pertain to the same broader acquisition, though they possibly pertain to different projects. In a peculiar situation where some of the s of the High Court attained finality as the compensation amount, as enhanced, stands paid whereas the others are still subject matter of adjudication, we deem it appropriate to remand these cases also to the High Court so that a holistic view pertaining to the subject acquisition, at least project wise, can be taken by the High Court. The High Court will make an endeavour to infuse uniformity in the matter of award of compensation, to the extent it is possible, in accordance with law. 15. It goes without saying that the High Court, while undertaking this exercise, will not reduce the compensation to a rate which has already been paid to some of the land owners and which has attained finality. The rest of the contentions from both sides are kept open to be gone into by the High Court.
