This understanding can be traced to numerous provisions of Part III of the Constitution, the preambular values, and the jurisprudence which has emanated from Courts. For example, this Court has held that the right to live under Article 21 secures more than the right of physical existence. It includes, inter alia, the right to a quality life which has been interpreted to include the right to live in an environment free from smoke and pollution,184 the right to access good roads,185 and a suitable accommodation which would enable them to grow in every aspect – mental, physical, and intellectual.186 Similarly, it has been established that a free exchange of ideas recognized under Article 19 is an integral aspect of the right to self-development.187 The rights against exploitation188 and against discrimination and untouchability189 secure the creation of equal spaces in public and private spheres, which is essential for self-growth. The right to quality education without discrimination190 also ensures that every citizen secures basic education to develop themselves. 183 Margaret Trawick, Notes on Love in a Tamil Family (University of California Press 1992) 184 MC Mehta v.

This understanding of the Constitution is substantiated on a reading of Part IV of the Constitution. To illustrate, Article 38 states that the State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people, Article 42 stipulates that the State shall endeavour to secure just and humane conditions of work, and Article 47 places a duty on the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living. The Constitution, through both positive and negative postulations, inter alia capacitates citizens in their quest to develop themselves. Such capacity-building enables them to achieve their full potential in both the private and the public space, and to be happy. The Indian Constitution (unlike, say, the South African Constitution) does not expressly provide that the Constitution seeks to improve the quality of life and free the potential of each person. However, such an understanding can be gleaned from the provisions of Part III and Part IV of the Constitution. Thus, one of the purposes of the rights framework is to enable the citizenry to attain the goal of self-development. 215. Martha C. Nussbaum laid down a list of ten capabilities which are central requirements to live a quality life.192 Two of the identifi ed capabilities are crucial for our discussion.193 The fi rst is ‘emotions’ which is characterized as follows: “5.
