21. In the present case, therefore there is absolutely no ambiguity that both the Tripartite Agreements dated 31.03.2007 and 25.07.2008 922 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. contain an arbitration clause, which forms the basis of all subsequent agreements including the agreements sought to be declared as validly terminated by the appellants and the conveyance deed sought to be declared as null and void. Both the trial court as well as the High Court have given a correct finding on facts as well as on law. We find no scope for interference in the matter. This appeal hence has no force, and is hereby dismissed. No as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal dismissed. Ankit Gyan
