and, thereupon, show cause notices dated 17th February 2000 and 10th April 2000 were issued and two adjudication s dated 15th September 2000 and 10th October 2000 were passed. 23. In a similar factual matrix, a three judges’ bench of this Court in Commissioner of Customs, Calcutta and Another v. Biecco Lawrie Ltd.31 had examined the provisions of Section 15 of the Customs Act, as they then existed, and have opined that clause (b) to Section 15(1) of the Customs Act will cease to apply when the requirements under Section 68 of the Customs Act stand fulfi lled and the imported goods are cleared for home consumption. In the context of the present case, we must hold that the debt had become ‘due’ in terms of the two adjudication s dated 15th September 2000 and 10th October 2000 and ‘payable’ immediately. Thus, the customs duty became ‘due and payable’ prior to twelve months next to the ‘relevant date’; the ‘relevant date’ being the date of winding up of the Company on 1st December 2003. The amount ‘due and payable’ in terms of the two adjudication s dated 15th September 2000 and 10th October 2000 would, therefore, not fall in the category of preferential payments under clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the Companies Act. 31 (2008) 3 SCC 264. IDBI (THROUGH STRESSED ASSETS STABILIZATION FUND 1079 CONSTITUTED BY THE GoI)v. SUPT. OF CENTRAL EXCISE AND CUSTOMS AND OTHERS [SANJIV KHANNA, J.] 24. We have also examined Sections 61, 72 and 142 of the Customs Act32 to consider the question of whether the Customs Act confers and creates statutory fi rst charge on the customs dues, and are of the opinion that the sections do not incorporate a statutory fi rst charge to override the general law, as per the dictum in Dena Bank (supra). The provisions of the land revenue enactment applicable in the present case have not been relied upon by the respondents, in which event, a legal issue relating to confl ict of laws would have arisen and required an answer. The provisions in the Customs Act do not, in any manner, negate or override the statutory preference in terms of Section 529A of the Companies Act, which treats the secured creditors and the workmen’s dues33 as overriding preferential creditors; and the government dues limited to debts ‘due and payable’ in the twelve months next before the relevant date, which are to be treated as preferential payments under Section 530 of the Companies Act, but are ranked below overriding preferential payments and have to be paid after the payment has been made in terms of Section 529 and 529A of the Companies Act. Therefore, the prior secured creditors are entitled to enforce their charge, notwithstanding the government dues payable under the Customs Act. 25. The view and the ratio we have expressed is in consonance with the decision of this Court in Punjab National Bank v. Union of India and Others34. A similar view has also been expressed by a three judges’ bench of this Court in Sundaresh Bhatt, Liquidator of ABG Shipyard v. Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs35, with references to the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 201636 and the Customs Act.
