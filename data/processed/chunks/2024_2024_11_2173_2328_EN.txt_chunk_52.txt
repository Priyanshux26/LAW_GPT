The House of Lords observed that the principle that no person should be judge in their own cause “is not to be confined to a cause in which he is a party, but applies to a cause in which he has an interest.”175 90. In R v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2),176 the House of Lords held that the former head of Chile was not immune from extradition to Spain for trial of alleged crimes against humanity. Lord Hoffman was one of the five 169 Manak Lal v. Dr. Prem Chand Sighvi, 1957 SCC OnLine SC 10 170 G Sarana v. University of Lucknow (1976) 3 SCC 585 [12]; Union of India v. B N Jha (2003) 4 SCC 531 [28] 171 R v. Rand (1866) LR 1 QB 230, 232. [Blackburn J. observed that “[t]here is no doubt that any direct pecuniary interest, however small, in the subject of inquiry, does disqualify a person from acting as a judge in the matter.”]; R v. Camborne Justices, ex parte Pearce, [1955] 1 QB 41. 172 Dimes v. The Proprietors of the Grand Junction Canal (1852) 3 HLC 759; Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd, [1999] EWCA Civ 3004 173 Locabail (supra) [8] 174 (1852) 3 HL Cas 759 175 Dimes (supra) 793. [Lord Campbell observed: “No one can suppose that Lord Cottenham [Lord Chancellor] could be, in the remotest degree, influenced by the interest that he had in this concern; but, my Lords, it is of the last importance that the maxim that no man is to be a judge in his own cause should be held sacred. And that is not confined to a cause in which he is a party, but applies to a cause in which he has an interest.”] 176 [1999] UKHL 1 2240 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports members who agreed with the majority. During the hearings, Amnesty International,177 a human rights body, intervened and participated in the proceedings. It came to light after the that Lord Hoffman was a director and chairman of Amnesty International Charity Limited,178 which was wholly owned and controlled by AI. Resultantly, the House of Lords set aside its previous decision and directed a rehearing of the matter. 91. Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed that AI and AICL were all “parts of an entity or movement” working in different fields to establish that Pinochet was not immune from extradition as a former head of State. This interest of the organizations was termed as a non- pecuniary interest to achieve a particular result. The rationale of automatic disqualification was held to extend to situations where a judge’s decision will lead to the promotion of a cause in which the judge is involved with one of the parties.179 In re Pinochet (supra) extended automatic disqualification to situations where a judge has an interest in the cause, which is being promoted by one of the parties to the case. b. Real likelihood of bias 92. The nemo judex rule may be applicable where a judge’s conduct or circumstances give rise to an apprehension of bias.
