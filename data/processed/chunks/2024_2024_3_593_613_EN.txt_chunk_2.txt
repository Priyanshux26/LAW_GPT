This appeal entails correlation of three vintage legislations, requiring not only their interpretation but also their harmonious construction. The oldest of the three statutes is the Maharashtra Hereditary Offices Act, 1874 (for brevity, ‘the 1874 Act’). The next is the Maharashtra Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 (for brevity, ‘the Tenancy Act’), and the third is the Maharashtra Revenue Patels (Abolition of Offices) Act, 1962 (for brevity, ‘the Abolition Act’). 2. The 1874 Act was enacted to declare and amend the law relating to Watans, i.e., hereditary offices. Balaji Chimnaji More, the predecessor of the present appellants, held a Patel Watan since prior to August, 1898.
