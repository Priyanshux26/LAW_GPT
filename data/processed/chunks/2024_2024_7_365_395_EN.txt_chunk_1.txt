[Paras 41, 42, 43, 46, 50, 52] Evidence – Testimony of witness – Unnatural conduct: Held: In the instant case, two sisters (PW-1 and PW-2) claimed to have personally witnessed the assault being made on J (deceased) – They admitted in their cross-examination that they had been arraigned as accused in a couple of prohibition cases – Thus, it can safely be inferred that these two so-called eyewitnesses were having sufficient contact with the legal system and were well aware of the legal machinery and would be knowing the importance of filing a complaint promptly – However, they did not approach the higher officials or the concerned Court to make [2024] 7 S.C.R. 367 Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat a complaint of the alleged assault made on their victim brother in the Amraiwadi Police Station by the police officials – They also did not approach the advocate engaged by them to tell him about the custodial torture – This pertinent omission in failing to inform their advocate about the custodial torture allegedly meted out to J gives rise to a strong assumption about the unnatural conduct of these eyewitnesses, casting a doubt on the truthfulness of their version and discredits their testimony. [Paras 29, 30] Evidence Act, 1872 – Marking of exhibit – Proof of document: Held: Mere marking of exhibit upon the letter without the expert deposing about the opinion given therein would not dispense with the proof of contents of the document as per the mandate of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. [Para 36] Evidence – Contradiction between the opinion of Medical jurist and ocular testimony: Held: This Court is conscious of the proposition that where there are contradictions inter se between the opinion of the Medical Jurist and the ocular testimony, generally, the evidence of the eyewitnesses should be given precedence – However, where the contradiction is so prominent that it completely demolishes the version of the eyewitnesses who are interested and partisan, in such cases, the Court should be circumspect in admitting the evidence of the eyewitness while ignoring the convincing opinion of the Medical Expert.
