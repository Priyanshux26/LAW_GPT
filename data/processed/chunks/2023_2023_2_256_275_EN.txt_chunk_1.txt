There is complete D exclusion of the land occupied by buildings adjacent to Delhi town which falls before the establishment of Municipal Corporation of Delhi and is not a land covered for the purpose by deciding rights of the parties under tenure holder under Chapter II of the Act, 1954. [Para 26][268-F-G] E 1.3 Section 150(3), (4) and (5) of the Act indicate that if the Gaon Sabha area ceases to be included in rural areas as defined in the Act, 1957 by virtue of notification under Section 507 of the Act, the Gaon Sabha shall thereupon stand dissolved or if a portion of Gaon Sabha area ceases to be included in rural areas as aforesaid, the jurisdiction of the Gaon Sabha for that area ceases F in respect of that portion and for that portion stands dissolved or to that extent, the size of the Gaon Sabha stands reduced as a result of a portion ceasing to be included in rural area. [Para 27][268-G-H; 269-A] 1.4 The Act, 1957 has been primarily enacted to have a G uniform body to administer the Delhi Municipal Corporation to consolidate various bodies, local authorities, looking after the municipal affairs and to centralise for better administration and to overcome the problems being faced by various authorities as well as by the public. Section 2(52) defines the ‘rural areas’ which H 258 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A demonstrates that the area of Delhi which immediately before the establishment of a Corporation, falls within the local limits of the District Board of Delhi, be considered to be the rural area but that shall not include such portion thereof which by virtue of notification u/s. 507 declared to be urbanized and it ceases to be included under the term ‘rural areas’ and Section 2(61) defines B ‘urban areas’ as the areas of Delhi which are not rural areas. [Para 29, 30][270-C-E] 1.5 Once there is a notification issued by the competent authority in exercise of power under Section 507(a) which is a special provision in reference to rural areas, such of the rural C areas cease to be included therein upon issuance of the notification and shall thereafter include in and form part of the urban areas in terms of the notification. Sub-clause (b) and (c ) of Section 507 deals with the nature of grant of exemption or levy of taxes for such of the areas falling within the scope and ambit of the Act, D 1957. At the same time, Section 502 only provides that this Act (Act 1957) shall not be construed authorizing disregard to any law for the time being in force and rightly so for the reason, that scope and ambit of the Act, 1954, in no manner, has to be disregarded by the provisions of the Act, 1957. [Para 31, 32][270- E-H] E 1.6 Delhi Development Act, 1957 nowhere makes a distinction in the nature of land whether it is rural or urban, as the case may be.
