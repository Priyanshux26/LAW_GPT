Thus, the District Court, by dated 17.02.2004, held that the of the Trial Court was in violation of mandatory provisions of law. 6. Aggrieved, the Appellant filed Writ Petition being Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.18990 of 2004 against the of the District Judge dated 17.02.2004. The Appellant pleaded that the District Court has taken a hyper technical approach in dismissing the restoration. Further, he had clearly submitted in the restoration application that he came to know about the ex parte decree on 28.10.1994 and without further delay he filed restoration application on 31.10.1994. Thus, from the date of knowledge, the limitation for filing the application will start. There was no requirement of filing a separate application for condonation of delay as the restoration application itself was not time barred. 7. The High Court by the impugned dated 24.05.2022, dismissed the Writ petition filed by the Appellant. The High Court has held that the limitation for filing application under IX Rule 13 CPC is 30 days and it starts running from the date of the decree. As the ex parte decree was passed on 11.04.1994, the limitation for filing the restoration application expired on 11.05.1994. However, the application was filed by the Appellant on 31.10.1994, which is about five months after expiry of the limitation. Since the application was filed beyond time, it must be accompanied with an application under section 5 of the Limitation Act praying for condonation of delay. As no such application was filed by the Appellant, there was no proper application [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2079 Dwarika Prasad (D) Thr. LRs. v. Prithvi Raj Singh under IX Rule 13 of CPC in the eye of law. Thus, the High Court held that the Addl. District Judge was correct in allowing the Revision. 8. The Appellants preferred the Special Leave to Appeal before this Court against the of the High Court. This Court has issued notice and granted six weeks’ time to file the counter affidavit on 20.07.2022. The Respondent has not filed the counter affidavit till date. The counsel for Respondent had put in appearance, way back in October 2022. He was not present on multiple dates including the last date, when this matter was heard on 09.12.2024. 9. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and perused the record. We are of the opinion that the High Court has erred in upholding the of the Additional District Judge. The Trial Court had rightly allowed the restoration application filed by the Appellant under IX Rule 13 of CPC. It is well settled that Courts should not shut out cases on mere technicalities but rather afford opportunity to both sides and thrash out the matter on merits. Further, we cannot let the party suffer due to negligent or fault committed by their counsel. This principle has been enunciated by this court in the case of Rafiq v. Munshilal,1 quoted as follows: “3. The disturbing feature of the case is that under our present adversary legal system where the parties generally appear through their advocates, the obligation of the parties is to select his advocate, brief him, pay the fees demanded by him and then trust the learned Advocate to do the rest of the things.
