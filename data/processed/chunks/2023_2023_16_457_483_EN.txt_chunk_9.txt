Hence, the Lieutenant Governor is bound by the decisions of GNCTD on services, save and except for the excluded subjects and as modifi ed by the law. These principles have been culled out prima facie at this stage on an analysis of the observations of the in 2023 Constitution Bench. 15. Two issues fall for the consideration of this Court: fi rstly, whether the Union Government has the unilateral power to appoint the Chief Secretary of NCTD; and secondly, whether the Union Government has the power to extend the service of the incumbent Chief Secretary. 476 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 16. We will fi rst deal with the issue of whether the Union Government has the unilateral power to appoint the Chief Secretary of NCTD. Rule 2(b) of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules 195415 defi nes Cadre post as any of the posts specifi ed under item 1 of each cadre in the Schedule to the Indian Administrative Service (Fixation of Cadre Strength) Regulations 195516. The 1955 Regulations mention Chief Secretary as one of the cadre posts. Rule 7 of the 1954 Rules states that all appointments to cadre posts in a joint cadre shall be made by the State Government concerned. The State Government is defi ned in relation to a Joint cadre to mean the Joint Cadre Authority. Rule 11A of the 1954 Rules states that the power of the State Government , inter alia, under Rule 7 in relation to the members of the Service serving in connection with the aff airs of any of the constituent States shall be exercised by the Government of that State, and State is defi ned to include Union Territory17. The 2023 Constitution Bench interpreted the above provisions and held that the GNCTD has the power to make appointments to cadre posts in NCTD: “173. We shall take the example of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, which deal with the posting of IAS Offi cers. Rule 2(a) defi nes “cadre offi cer” to mean a member of IAS. Rule 2(b) defi nes “Cadre post” as any post specifi ed under Item I of each cadre in the Schedule to the Indian Administrative Service (Fixation of Cadre Strength) Regulations, 1955. Rule 2(c) defi nes “State” to mean a State specifi ed in the Schedule I to the Constitution and includes a Union Territory. Rule 2(d) defi nes “State Government concerned”, in relation to a Joint cadre, to mean the Joint Cadre Authority. The constitution and composition of a “Joint Cadre Authority” is understood with reference to the All-India Services (Joint Cadre) Rules, 1972. The 1972 Rules apply to a “Joint Cadre constituted for any group of States other than the Joint Cadre of Union Territories”. Rule 3 of the IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954 provides for the constitution of cadres for each State or group of States “as a “State Cadre” or, as the case may be, a “Joint Cadre”. Rule 5 empowers the Central Government to allocate 15 “1954 Rules’ 16 “1955 Regulations” 17 Rule 2(c) of the 1955 Regulations GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI v. UNION OF INDIA 477 & ORS.
