Respondent No.2 after being counselled, returned to her matrimonial house. It was further submitted that respondent No.2 addressed a letter dated 11.11.2021 to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Thirupathur Sub Division requesting to close the complaint made by appellant No.1 wherein she admitted that she had left her matrimonial house after quarrelling with appellant No.1 because of one Govindan, with whom she was talking over the phone for the past ten days continuously. She also stated that she would not repeat such acts in future. Learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that respondent No.2 again left the matrimonial house leaving appellant No.1 and children behind. It was submitted that having no other option, appellant No.1 issued a legal notice dated 13.12.2021 to respondent No.2 seeking divorce by mutual consent. Therefore, it was argued that only as a counterblast, the present FIR has been lodged by respondent No.2. on 01.02.2022. Insofar as appellant Nos.2 to 6 are concerned, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that no specific allegation is made against them in the 564 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports FIR. It was further submitted that appellant Nos.2 to 6 did not live in the matrimonial house of the couple and have been unnecessarily dragged into this case. Therefore, it was submitted that the present case is a fit case for quashing the FIR and accordingly prayed that this Court may set-aside the impugned dated 16.02.2022 and quash the criminal proceedings pending against the appellants herein arising out of FIR No. 82 of 2022 dated 01.02.2022. 9. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent-State submitted that on a perusal of the FIR, it would reveal that a prima facie case has been made out against the appellants. It was submitted that, as per the FIR, respondent No.2 was harassed both physically and mentally for want of additional dowry and that appellant No.1 used to come home in a drunken state and used to have an illicit affair with one Mounika. Learned counsel for the respondent-State submitted that the father of respondent No.2 was examined as LW3 who stated in the examination that at the time of marriage, he gave Rs.10 lakhs and 10 tolas of gold as dowry. It was further submitted that after the marriage, appellant No.1 used to harass and abuse respondent No.2 and appellant Nos.2 to 6 used to provoke and instigate appellant No.1. Hence, learned counsel for the respondent-State argued that the High Court, vide impugned , was justified in declining to quash the criminal proceedings pending against the appellants herein arising out of FIR No.82 of 2022 dated 01.02.2022 and prayed for the dismissal of the present appeal as well. 10. Having heard the learned counsel for the respective parties and having perused the material on record, the only question that arises for our consideration is whether FIR No.82 of 2022, dated 01.02.2022, lodged against the appellants herein should be quashed. 11. In State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 (“Bhajan Lal”), this Court formulated the parameters under which the powers under Section 482 of the CrPC could be exercised.
