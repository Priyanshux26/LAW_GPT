If the court finds the witnesses to be truthful and credible, the lack of a cogent explanation for the delay may not be regarded as detrimental. Police Statements of Eye-witnesses 31. The High Court, in its reasoning, takes an exception on the minor discrepancies regarding the place and time of recording the statement under Section 161 CrPC of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25). Similarly, the impugned has adversely commented on the versions given by Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) as to who had reached the hospital at an earlier point in time. 21 (2016) 2 SCC 607 1338 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Considering the efflux of time of more than 4-6 years between the date of occurrence and recording of court testimony, these issues are at best superficial and peripheral and would not warrant disregarding the prosecution case. The questions posed to the witnesses were more in the nature of a memory test rather than questions posed to test the truthfulness and credibility of their core testimony. Equally, the observation of the High Court on the statement under Section 161 CrPC of Rama Devi (PW-24) to Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of the CBI, is inconsequential. Section 161 CrPC statement of Rama Devi, in which she had given the names and details of the persons who were present in the hospital, cannot be brushed aside solely on this ground. Statements under Section 161 CrPC are per se not evidence in the court. Rama Devi’s statement under Section 161 CrPC was recorded on 13.06.1998 and the same was filed along with the chargesheet. She was not cross-examined regarding the said statement. 32. The assertion that Rama Devi’s (PW-24) Section 161 CrPC statement dated 13.06.1998 to Shashi Bhushan Sharma, IO (PW-54), has not been included in the record is solely predicated on her cross-examination conducted on 21.02.2006. Rama Devi’s (PW-24) acknowledgement during her cross-examination reflects a clear lapse in memory, likely due to the nearly eight-year gap and the length of her questioning. It is a well-established fact that SSP Yadav was the IO on 13.06.1998, making it impossible for Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) to have recorded her Section 161 CrPC statement on that date. Moreover, Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) was never questioned about whether he had recorded Rama Devi’s (PW-24) Section 161 CrPC statement on 13.06.1998. In fact, both the defence and prosecution agree that Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) took over the investigation on 14.07.1998. Attesting Witnesses and Retaliatory Firing 33. The contention that Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) were not attesting witnesses to the inquest report, fardbeyan, FIR, etc. is inconsequential and does not in any way weaken their ocular evidence. Similarly, the contention that they were not injured during the cross-fire is nugatory as it is clear from the evidence on record that it was Brij Bihari Prasad who was the target of the attack. The armed bodyguards who were attacked [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1339 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others had retaliated.
