Though the Collector of Stamps determined the stamp duty for the subject land as per Article 22 of Schedule IA of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, which states about conveyance, in this case, we have already held that the compromise decree does not fall under the instruments mentioned in the Schedule and that it only asserts the pre-existing rights. Therefore, in the facts of the case, the consent decree will not operate as conveyance as no right is transferred and the same does not require any payment of stamp duty. Since the appellant has only asserted the pre-existing right and no new right was created through the consent decree, the 1234 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports document pertaining to mutation of the subject land is not liable for stamp duty. 14. In the ultimate analysis, we find that the impugned passed by the High Court, upholding the s of the authorities below, has no legs to stand and is hence, set aside. Accordingly, this appeal stands allowed and the authority concerned shall make mutation of the revenue records in respect of the subject land in favour of the appellant. There is no as to costs. 15. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
