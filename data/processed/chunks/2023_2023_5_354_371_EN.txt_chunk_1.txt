1.3 This Court has been consistent in interfering in such matters where purely civil disputes, more often than not, relating to land and/or money are given the colour of criminality, only for E the purposes of exerting extra-judicial pressure on the party concerned, which is nothing but abuse of the process of the court. In the present case, there is a huge and unexplained delay of over 60 years in initiating dispute with regard to the ownership of the land in question, and the criminal case has been lodged F only after failure to obtain relief in the civil suits, coupled with denial of relief in the interim therein to the respondent no.2/her family members. It is evident that resort was now being had to criminal proceedings which, in the considered opinion of this Court, is with ulterior motives, for oblique reasons and is a clear case of vengeance. Even if the allegations are taken to be true G on their face value, it is not discernible that any offence can be said to have been made out under the SC/ST Act against the appellant. The complaint and FIR are frivolous, vexatious and oppressive. [Paras 36, 37][370-E-H] H 356 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 1.4 The officers, who institute an FIR, based on any complaint, are duty bound to be vigilant before invoking any provision of a very stringent statute, like the SC/ST Act, which imposes serious penal consequences on the concerned accused. The officer has to be satisfied that the provisions he seeks to invoke prima facie apply to the case at hand. [Para 38][371-A-B] B 1.5 The High Court fell in error in not invoking its wholesome power under Section 482 of the Code to quash the FIR. The Impugned , being untenable in law, is set aside. The FIR, as also any proceedings emanating therefrom, insofar as they relate to the appellant, are quashed and set aside.
