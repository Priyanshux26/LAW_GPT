(c) Right of exclusion and Article 326 336. Article 326, while conferring the right to vote, also broadly provides that this right would be subject to certain statutory limitations. A 213 Anoop Baranwal v. Union of India (2023) 6 SCC 161 214 Inderjit Barua v. Election Commission of India, AIR 1984 SC 1911 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1131 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 brief perusal of the Constituent Assembly Debates, along with contemporary jurisprudence, clearly indicates that Article 326 confers the right to vote upon individuals and does not elaborate on the procedure of exclusion of persons from this entitlement. In to ascertain where the power of exclusion has been enumerated, we will analyse the following: (i) Constituent Assembly Debates; (ii) the practice in comparative jurisdictions; (iii) relevant statute; and (iv) contemporary jurisprudence. 337. Primarily, the considerations of the Constituent Assembly during the discourse on the right to vote emphasized that determinations regarding disqualifications and exclusions from the right to vote should be outlined by the legislature through suitable statutes. In this context, focused deliberations were conducted, particularly addressing the prescription of qualifications for the right to vote, with Dr. B.R. Ambedkar asserting that the establishment of such qualifications ought to be entrusted to the legislature.215 Similar observations were articulated by other members of the Assembly during discussions on the qualifications and disqualifications to the right to vote and inclusion of individuals in the electoral rolls.216 338. Furthermore, an examination of practices in comparable jurisdictions underscores that the authority to exclude individuals from voting is usually entrusted to the legislature. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the rationale and procedure for the exclusion of any individual from voting are delineated in the Representation of the People Act, 1918. Similarly, in the USA, the power and discretion to enforce the right to vote of citizens are bestowed upon Congress.217 339. In India, too, the Representation of People Acts, 1950 and 1951 delineate provisions relating to the disqualification from voting, removal of disqualification, the right to vote, and prohibitions against seeking votes by appealing to divisive factors. In fact, the 1951 Act also elucidates the right to vote under Section 62 and establishes limitations and disqualifications surrounding it. The Representation of People Act, 1950 has in place a scheme and procedure for effectuating changes onto the electoral roll if it is considered erroneous under 215 B.R. Ambedkar, Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume 8, 02.06.1949. 216 Alladi Krishnaswamy Ayyar, Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume 11, 23.11.1949. 217 South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966). 1132 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Section 22. This provision states that if the electoral registration officer for a constituency, upon an application made to him or on his own motion, is satisfied that an entry in the electoral roll of a constituency is defective or erroneous, should be transposed to another place on account of the concerned person having changed his place of ordinary residence, or if the person is dead or is not entitled to be registered on that roll, then the officer may amend, transpose or delete such an entry.
