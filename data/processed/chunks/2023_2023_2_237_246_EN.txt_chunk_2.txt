H 240 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A 4. Having regard to the High Court’s finding, especially the absence of a probate or letters of administration, the respondents herein approached the competent court for letters of administration6. At the time of trial, none of the attesting witnesses was alive. The trial court therefore, relied upon the depositions of two of the sons of the testator as well as the deposition of one Surendra Nath Bhowmick who deposed B to having seen the testator duly sign the will. 5. The administration proceedings were contested by the present appellant, i.e., the purchaser of the properties from Upendra. He contended that the proceedings were not maintainable as relief was sought after an inordinately long period of time. The trial court relied upon the C depositions of witnesses as well as the documents produced which included the registered deed of partition, dated 21.02.1945, which expressly mentioned the will in question. The trial court also relied upon a document, i.e., deed executed by Upendra, which also contained a reference to the will. D 6. Having regard to the materials, the court recorded a finding that the respondent was entitled to letters of administration. An appeal against that was rejected.7 Therefore, the present appeal. Arguments 7. It was argued on behalf of the appellant by Mr Ranjan E Mukherjee, Ld. Advocate, that the courts below could not have relied upon the will and granted the letters of administration in the absence of any evidence to substantiate that the will was executed properly. It was urged that there were suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the will which cast a doubt about its genuineness given that the F propounder had raised various contentions, including one for adverse possession in a previous suit for partition. It was also argued that the courts below could not have accepted the will on the basis of Section 90 of the Evidence Act,1872 and relied upon the partition deed of 1945 nor upon the ‘Nabadi’ said to have been executed by Upendra. It was urged that the inordinate delay in approaching the court ought to have defeated G the claim for letters of administration. 8. On the other hand, Mr Bikash Kar Gupta, Ld. Advocate, contended on behalf of the respondents that the present case is one 6 By filing O.S. No. 79/1969. H 7 Impugned . ASHUTOSH SAMANTA (D) BY LRS. v. SM. RANJAN BALA 241 DASI [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] where the courts have rendered concurrent findings of fact, which this A court should not interfere with. It was urged that the will was duly proved and that the question of delay in approaching the court for letters of administration did not arise. 9. The respondent had relied upon the record, and the findings rendered by the trial court, as well as the High Court, and contended B that both courts consistently recorded satisfaction that the ingredients necessary to prove the will had been satisfied, and the courts did not rest their findings only on the basis of a presumption that the document was old.
