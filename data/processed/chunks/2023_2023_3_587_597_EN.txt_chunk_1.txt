D [Paras 19, 20][594-C-F] 3. The High Court during the bail proceedings of a third party are manifestly arbitrary and unjust, and the High Court must have confined itself to the issues relevant to it for the purposes of deciding the bail of the Respondent No.1. A court of bail, E especially in cases where the bail is sought for by a third party, is not a court that has all the relevant information to pass an on the merits of an unconnected party, and such an , if passed, has the potential to cause great harm to the said party without them being afforded an actual and meaningful opportunity to defend themselves. It is a well settled principle of law that any F party, when being accused of an illegal act, must be given an opportunity be fairly heard. This opportunity to be meaningfully heard however has not been afforded to the Appellant No.2. [Para 25][596-E-G] Niranjan Patnaik v.
