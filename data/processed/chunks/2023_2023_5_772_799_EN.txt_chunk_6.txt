As a necessary sequel to the annulment of retrospectivity, it was ed that there should be no recovery of subsistence allowance and hence, the dated 13.08.2007 for recovery of subsistence C allowance was quashed. Naturally, the prayer or reinstatement in service was rejected. 5. Both the appellant and the respondent Organization assailed the of the Tribunal in O.A. No. 653 of 2007 before the High Court. The respondent Organization filed W.P. (C) No. 4918/2008, essentially D challenging the in O.A. No.653 of 2007 to the extent of effacing the retrospective effect of the of dismissal of the appellant herein from 01.09.2003 and restricting its effect only from the date of the viz., 11.08.2007 and restraining recovery of subsistence allowance. The appellant herein filed W.P. (C) No.33421 of 2008 aggrieved by the disinclination to quash the of dismissal and to for his E reinstatement in service. The High Court dismissed W.P. (C) No.33421 of 2008 as per the impugned and hence, this appeal by special leave. It is required to be noted that subsequently, as per dated 16.02.2009 the High Court dismissed W.P. (C) No.4918 of 2008 filed by the respondent Organisation and consequently, the dated 31.05.2010 F was issued giving effect to the of the Tribunal in O.A. No.653 of 2007 and modifying the date of effect of the of dismissal from the very date of the same. 6. Heard, Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant and Shri Shailesh Madiyal, learned counsel G for respondent Nos.1 to 4. 7. Indisputably, the appellant was dismissed form service without any inquiry in the manner provided in ‘the CCA Rules’ invoking the power under clause (iii) of Rule 16 of CCA Rules, which reads thus: - “16. Special Procedure in certain cases H DR. V. R. SANAL KUMAR v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 781 [C. T. RAVIKUMAR, J.] Notwithstanding anything contained in Rules 11 to 15 A – (i) where any penalty is imposed on an employee on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge; or B (ii) where the Disciplinary Authority is satisfied for reasons to be recorded by it in writing that it is not reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry in the manner provided in these Rules; or (iii) where the President is satisfied that in the interest of C the security of the State, it is not expedient to hold any inquiry in the manner provided in these Rules, the Disciplinary Authority may consider the circumstances of the case and make such s thereon as it deems fit: Provided that the employee may be given an opportunity of making representation on the penalty D proposed to be imposed before any is made in a case under Clause (i): Provided further that the Commission shall be consulted, where such consultation is necessary, before any s are made in any case under this Rule.” E 8. A bare perusal of the afore-quoted provision and the second proviso to Article 311 (2) of the Constitution of India would undoubtedly go to show that the former is virtually a service rule reproducing the second proviso almost in whole though the language used is not identical.
