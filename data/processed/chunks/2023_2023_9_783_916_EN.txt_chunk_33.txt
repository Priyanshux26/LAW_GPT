The Appellate Tribunal observed that as per the requirements of Sections 30 and 31 of the Code, only the plan approved by CoC was D to be presented before NCLT for approval. It was further held by the Appellate Tribunal that such procedural failure was that of a material irregularity, undermining the integrity of the process and rendering the resolution plan void and non est in law. The observations of the Appellate Tribunal with respect to this issue of want of approval of the revised E resolution plan by CoC could be usefully reproduced as under: - “130. On perusal of the minutes of 9th COC, it is clear that COC did not finally approve the Resolution Plan on 22 January 2021. In this meeting, COC sent back the Resolution Plan to the Resolution Applicant for further revision based on the CoC Resolution. This revised Resolution Plan dated 25 January 2021 was never sent F for Approval before the COC. 131. The Resolution Professional’s statement that ‘the revised Resolution Plan was approved at the 9th COC meeting’ is incorrect. Although the Resolution Plan was allegedly approved on 22 January 2021, it is not the Revised G Resolution Plan. Instead, the Resolution Plan was further modified based on the CoC resolution Dt.22.1.2021. But the final Revised Resolution Plan, dated 25 January 2021, was never laid before the CoC for its approval. Thus the approval of the Resolution Plan by the Adjudicating Authority is H not in compliance with Sec. 31(1) of the I & B Code, 2016. M. K. RAJAGOPALAN v. DR. PERIASAMY PALANI 831 GOUNDER & ANR. [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] 132. It is pertinent to mention that after Approval of the A Resolution Plan by COC entire exercise for revising the Resolution Plan for making a complaint with Section 30 (2) of the Code was left with the Resolution Applicant. Revised Resolution Plan dated 25 January 2021, without further approval of CoC, was presented by RP before the B Adjudicating Authority for approval, which was finally approved by the impugned . 133. It is also important to mention that the learned Adjudicating Authority/National Company Law Tribunal has stated in the impugned that “it is seen that the final resolution plan C was put up for consideration by the COC in the 9th meeting held on 22 January 2021 and the said resolution was approved with a thumping majority of 87.39%.” 134. The Adjudicating Authority failed to notice that the Resolution Plan was not approved in the 9th COC meeting. Therefore, based D on the resolution of the 9th COC meeting, the Resolution Plan was to be sent back to the Resolution Applicant for further revision. After that, the final Revised Resolution Plan was made on 25 January 2021, but it was never presented before the COC for approval. E 135. After “revision”, the revised plan is never put to the vote. Instead, it is filed to NCLT directly, without any approval from the COC on the revised Resolution Plan. Sections 30(2), 30(4), 30(6) and Section 31 mandate that only a plan as approved by the ‘COC’ can be presented to the NCLT for its approval under Section 31.
