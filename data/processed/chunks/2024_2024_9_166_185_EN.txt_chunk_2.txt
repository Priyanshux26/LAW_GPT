(Amicus Curiae), Ms. Mallika Agarwal, Ms. Bagavathy V., Advs. Parikshit Angadi, Anirudh Sanganeria, Advs. for the Appellant. / of the Supreme Court S.V.N. Bhatti, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. The Civil Appeals arise from an dated 14.09.2021 in Review Petition No. 340 of 2019 and Writ Petition No. 30734 of 2019. 3. In these Civil Appeals, the scope of Sections 33, 34, 37, and 39 of the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957 (for short, ‘the Act’) arises for consideration. I. Factual Matrix 4. The appellant filed O.S. No. 295 of 2013 for perpetual injunction restraining the respondent from interfering with the appellant’s peaceful possession and enjoyment of the plaint schedule property. The plaint schedule property consists of agricultural land in Kavoor village of Mangalore taluk. The prayer for injunction rests on the plea that the respondent entered into the agreement of sale dated 29.06.1999 with the appellant. The appellant claims to have been put in possession of the plaint schedule property as part performance under the agreement of sale dated 29.06.1999 by the respondent. The other clauses covered by the agreement are not adverted to as part of the narrative, for they are of little relevance for disposing of the Civil Appeals. 5. It is alleged that the respondent, contrary to the possession given as part performance under the suit agreement, tried to dispossess the appellant. This led to exchange of notices between the parties. The sheet anchor in the appellant’s narrative is that the agreement of sale dated 29.06.1999 exists between the parties, and in part performance thereunder, the appellant was put in possession of the plaint schedule property by the respondent. Contrary to the ad idem of the parties in putting the appellant in possession, the respondent was trying to dispossess the appellant from the plaint schedule property. 170 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Therefore, the suit was filed for the relief of perpetual injunction. Briefly narrated, the possession claimed under the agreement of sale is sought to be protected through the prayer for perpetual injunction. 6. The respondent denies the execution of the agreement of sale dated 29.06.1999. The appellant, since claims possession through the agreement of sale, the suit agreement shall be treated as a conveyance. The suit agreement is insufficiently stamped. Therefore, the document is inadmissible in evidence unless the document is made compliant with the requirements of the Act. 6.1. The respondent filed an application before the trial court under Section 33 of the Act to impound the suit agreement to collect the deficit stamp duty and penalty in accordance with the Act. By dated 10.11.2016, the trial court sent the agreement of sale dated 29.06.1999 to the District Registrar for determination of requisite stamp duty and penalty payable on the agreement of sale. The record discloses that the District Registrar expressed inability to determine the deficit stamp duty and penalty payable on the suit agreement for want of the name of the village, hence, returned the instrument to the trial court.
