He was declared hostile and cross-examined by the prosecution. He again claimed that the police had taken them on the night of 28.03.2013. He stated that he 14 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. was released on the 5th from Gorakhpur Police Station but he did not make a complaint due to fear, as the police had beaten him a lot. 20. Princy Thakur (DW-2) stated that she used to visit Om Prakash Yadav’s house since a long time as her mother used to work for them. She claimed that the Gorakhpur police arrested Raja Yadav and Rajesh Yadav at 3-4 pm on 27.03.2013 itself and took them for questioning to the police station. She stated that, at about 8-9 pm on that day, the police took her also to Gorakhpur Police Station for questioning. She alleged that the police seized all their mobiles. According to her, the police beat Raja Yadav and Rajesh Yadav a lot. She further stated that the police pulled out Rajesh Yadav’s hair and that the three of them were questioned all day and night. She further claimed that, on 30.03.2013, the police brought Om Prakash Yadav to the police station at 2-3 o’clock. She asserted that the police beat Om Prakash Yadav a lot and that she saw it. Om Prakash was stated to have fallen down unconscious and two policemen, Rajesh Nag and Jugal Kishore, took him to Bhandari Hospital. She stated that, when she was released on 01.04.2013, she went to see Om Prakash Yadav at Bhandari Hospital and there were four policemen there, guarding him to ensure that he did not run away. She said that she used to go to give food every day to Om Prakash Yadav and the police were present all day and all night. She said that the police seized her mobile and she got it back through the Court on handing over a receipt. The evidence of this defence witness remained practically unshaken during her cross-examination. The prosecution conveniently chose to ignore this witness altogether and made no mention of her whatsoever. 21. Even if the deposition of DW-2 is discounted, going by the evidence of the prosecution’s own witnesses, viz., PW-2 and PW-4, Rajesh Yadav and Raja Yadav were taken by the police on 28.03.2013 itself and not on 29.03.2013, as claimed by the prosecution. However, their arrests were shown much later. Rajesh Yadav was arrested only on 29.03.2013 at 6:30pm, while Raja Yadav was arrested on 31.03.2013 at 5:40 pm. Om Prakash Yadav was arrested much later on 05.04.2013 at 3:30 pm. Most crucial is the fact that the Investigating Offi cer (PW-16) chose to examine Rajesh Yadav at 1:45 pm on 29.03.2013 and record his confession without even arresting him, whereby he would have stood ‘accused of an off ence’. It is on the strength of this confession that the police and the witnesses allegedly went RAJESH & ANR. v.
