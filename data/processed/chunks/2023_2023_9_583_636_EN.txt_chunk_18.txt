The constitutional concept of reservation envisaged in the Preamble of the Constitution as well as Articles 14, 15, 16 and 39-A of the directive principles of State policy is to achieve C the concept of giving equal opportunity to all sections of the society. The Division Bench, thus, erred in reversing the and passed by the learned Single Judge. Hence, the impugned and passed by the Division Bench in Letters Patent Appeal No. 562 of 2011 is not only erroneous but also suffers D from error in law as it has failed to follow the binding precedent of the s of this Court in Indra Sawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] and Valsamma Paul [Valsamma Paul v. Cochin University, (1996) 3 SCC 545 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 772 : (1996) 33 ATC 713]. Therefore, the E impugned and [Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board v. Ram Kumar Gijroya, 2012 SCC OnLine Del 472 : (2012) 128 DRJ 124] passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is liable to be set aside and accordingly set aside. The and dated 24-11-2010 passed by the learned Single F Judge in Ram Kumar Gijroya v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi) [Ram Kumar Gijroya v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi), WP (C) No. 382 of 2009, dated 24-11-2010 (Del)] is hereby restored.” 37. This came up for consideration later before two- Judge Bench of this Court in Karn Singh Yadav vs. Govt. of NCT of G Delhi and Others (SLP(C) No.14948/2016) and the Court has some reservations and referred the matter to be placed before three-Judge Bench by dated 24th January, 2020 and three-Judge Bench of this Court while relying upon Ram Kumar Gijroya (Supra) disposed of the appeal under its dated 28th September, 2022, it appears that the reference made by two-Judge Bench of this Court remained unnoticed. H 610 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A Be that as it may, the position as on today is that three-Judge Bench of this Court under its dated 28th September, 2022 has affirmed the view expressed by two-Judge Bench of this Court in Ram Kumar Gijroya (Supra). 38. That apart, taking into consideration the Scheme of Rules, B 2010, which is indisputedly, silent on the subject issue and the advertisement dated 22nd July, 2021 nowhere indicates that the caste certificate/certificate of category has to be produced of the period prior to the last date of the application (31st August, 2021) in the instant case. To the contrary, Clause 6(i) & (iii) read with Clause 22(3) of the advertisement, such certificate of category which one claimed for seeking C the benefit of reservation, has to be produced on demand by the recruiting authority. 39. In the given facts and circumstances, when the rules are silent and there is no such instruction that the certificate of the category has to be produced of the period on or before the last date of the application D under the advertisement and each of the applicants has produced the certificate relating to category on being demanded by the recruiting authority when the list came to be published of the candidates who were provisionally called for interview on 04th August, 2022, each of the applicants indisputedly has furnished their certificate of the category to E which they belong at the time of advertisement and had participated in the process of selection.
