[2024] 4 S.C.R. 13 : 2024 INSC 253 State of Kerala v. Union of India (Original Suit No. 1 of 2024) 01 April 2024 [Surya Kant* and K.V. Viswanathan, JJ.] Issue for Consideration What is the true import and interpretation of the expression “if and in so far as the dispute involves any question (whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends” contained in Article 131 of the Constitution; Does Article 293 of the Constitution vest a State with an enforceable right to raise borrowing from the Union government and/or other sources and if yes, to what extent such right can be regulated by the Union government; Can the borrowing by State-Owned Enterprises and liabilities arising out of the Public Account be included under the purview of Article 293(3); What is the scope and extent of Judicial Review exercisable by this Court with respect to a fiscal policy purportedly in conflict with the object and spirit of Article 293; Is fiscal decentralization an aspect of Indian Federalism and if yes, do the impugned actions taken by the Defendant-Union of India purportedly to maintain the fiscal health of the country violate such Principles of Federalism; Are the impugned actions violative of Article 14 of the Constitution on the ground of ‘manifest arbitrariness’ or on the basis of differential treatment meted out to the Plaintiff-State vis-à-vis other States; What has been the past practice regarding regulation of the Plaintiff’s borrowing by the Defendant; If such practice has been restrictive of Plaintiff’s borrowings, can it estop the Plaintiff from bringing the present suit; Conversely, if such practice has not been restrictive, can it serve as the basis for the Plaintiff’s legitimate expectations against the Defendant; Are the restrictions imposed by the impugned actions in conflict with the role assigned to the Reserve Bank of India as the public debt manager of the Plaintiff; Is it mandatory to have prior consultation with States for giving effect to the recommendations of Finance Commission. Headnotes Constitution of India – Article 293 – Borrowing by States – Union of India inter alia imposed Net Borrowing Ceiling on the * Author 14 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports State of Kerala, to restrict its maximum possible borrowing – Suit filed by State of Kerala on the premise that by undertaking the impugned actions, Union of India imposed ceiling on all its borrowings, and exceeded its power u/Article 293 – It also sought interim injunction, inter alia, to mandate Union of India to restore the position that existed before it imposed ceiling on all its borrowings; and to enable it to borrow INR 26,226 crores on an immediate basis: Held: Since Article 293 has so far not been the subject of any authoritative interpretation by this Court, the questions arising in the present suit squarely fall within the ambit of Article 145(3) of the Constitution – Questions referred to Constitution Bench of five judges – Matter be placed before Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate Bench – Further, the Plaintiff-State also sought mandatory injunction and hence, was required to meet a higher standard for the triple-test of interim relief – Prima facie, the argument of the Union is accepted that where there is over-utilization of the borrowing limit in the previous year, to the extent of over- borrowing, deductions are permissible in the succeeding year, even beyond the award period of the 14th Finance Commission– Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case regarding its contention on under-utilization of borrowing – The mischief that is likely to ensue in the event of granting the interim relief, will be far greater than rejecting the same – Balance of convenience clearly lies in favour of the Union of India – Plaintiff sought to equate ‘financial hardship’ with ‘irreparable injury’ – Prima facie ‘monetary damage’ is not an irreparable loss, as the Court can always balance the equities in its final outcome by ensuring that pending claims are adjusted along with resultant additional liability on the opposite party – If the State has essentially created financial hardship because of its own financial mismanagement, such hardship cannot be held to be an irreparable injury that would necessitate an interim relief against Union – Since the Plaintiff-State failed to establish the three prongs of proving prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury, it is not entitled to the interim injunction.
