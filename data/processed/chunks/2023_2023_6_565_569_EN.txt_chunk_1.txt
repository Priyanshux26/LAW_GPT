However, due to certain litigations, the appellant company had quit trading E in the Indian markets in 2006. It is important to note that at this point, the appellant company had shares and money in its bank account with ICICI bank. 4. Subsequently, the appellant company was subject to two freeze s under Section 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The F first freeze was imposed against the appellant company on 20.10.2006, and the second freeze was imposed on 17.08.2010. These abovementioned freeze s, as has been discussed in detail below, were levied against the appellant company on grounds of necessity of investigation of an alleged crime. At this point, It must be noted that the said investigation of the alleged crime was initiated against one G Dharmesh Doshi, who is in no way related to the appellant company, and he was never an employee/share holder/director or a key managerial person in the appellant company. 5. In so far as the first freeze is concerned, vide s dated 05.12.2008,14.05.2009,16.11.2009 and 17.08.2010, this Court H M/S. JERMYN CAPITAL LLC DUBAI v. CENTRAL BUREAU 567 OF INVESTIGATION & ORS. [KRISHNA MURARI, J.] allowed the appellant company to sell the shares in its account, convert A it into cash, and repatriate the funds so received with interest and without a bank guarantee, while the first freeze was still operational. In terms of the abovementioned s, the appellant company repatriated an amount of Rs. 42.51 crores without any bank guarantee. 6. The issue posed in front of us therefore is limited to the second B freeze . The second freeze , which was passed by the respondent herein on 17.08.2010, had incapacitated the appellant company herein to repatriate an amount of Rs. 38.52 crores, which was realized in favour of the appellant company herein pursuant to an passed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal dated 08.05.2006. C 7. Aggrieved, the appellant company had approached this Court for relief, and vide dated 12.10.2011, this Court gave liberty to the appellant company to approach the Trial Court for release of the said amount. 8. Subsequently, the learned Trial Court, after duly taking notice D of the fact that this Court had allowed the appellant company to repatriate an amount of Rs.42.51 crores, vide dated 02.11.2012, held that the appellant company was entitled to repatriate the amount of Rs. 38.52 crores, however, the release of such funds was subject to a bank guarantee equivalent to the amount sought to be withdrawn. E 9. Aggrieved by the said imposition of the bank guarantee, the appellant company approached the High Court, however, vide impugned dated 16.08.2018, the High Court reiterated the imposition of the Bank Guarantee. The appellant company has therefore, as against the impugned and , filed the present Appeal. F ANALYSIS 10. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties, however, it must be noted that despite notice being served the respondent no.2, ICICI Bank, they have chosen not to put in appearance. 11. It is our opinion, that a bare reading of the decisions rendered G by the lower Courts, would show that the imposition of the bank guarantee and the freeze s passed by the respondent, were solely imposed on the grounds of criminal proceedings being alive against one Dharmesh Doshi, who is alleged to be connected to the appellant company.
