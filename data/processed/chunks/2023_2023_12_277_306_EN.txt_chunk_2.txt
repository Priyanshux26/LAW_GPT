1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih in respect of 76 acres of land, subject to certain conditions, including the requirement to submit consent letters of owners of the land in question (Raiyats) – Another stipulation mentioned therein was the need for permission u/s. 14-Y of the WBLR Act, 1955 for holding the required land and furnishing of Conversion Certifi cate for plots of land from the appropriate authority in terms of s.4-C of the WBLR Act, 1955: Held: The controversy relating to Section 4-C of the WBLR Act, 1955, cannot simply be decided on the basis of Memo No. V/RTI/775/15 dated 06.03.2017 issued by the Deputy District Land and Land Reforms Offi cer, Purulia, that as per the revenue records the land was recorded as ‘Dungri’ – The reason is that Raiyat land is not for mining – Thus, a contradiction arises, as the grant of Raiyat land and the classifi cation of the same land as ‘Dungri’ is contradictory – Further, whether the consent letter of the owners of the land in question (Raiyats) obtained by the Respondent No. 1still hold good, would be relevant as there could be a change of hands on account of transfer, inheritance, etc – Connected with this are the legal issues – First, whether the Respondent No. 1 had altered its position post the issue of the Grant dated 16.07.2015, but before enforcement of the Concession Rules, 2016, to get the benefi t of Rule 61 of the Concessions Rules, 2016? – It is necessary to ascertain the facts and then alone one can adjudicate and decide the question whether the Respondent No. 1 is entitled to the benefi t of the proviso to Rule 61 of the Concession Rules, 2016 – This has not been verifi ed and ascertained – An issue would arise on whether the application fi led by the Respondent No. 1 way back in 1998 would still hold good as at the time, when the application was fi led, approval of the Central Government was required – Another diffi culty is that WBMDTCL has not been impleaded as a party, though it was always contesting the claim made by the Respondent No. 1 – However, these issues are not being examined in the light of the directions issued – Further, that the remand cannot be passed at this distinct point of time.
