Having considered the matter in detail, we have given our own reasons why respondent no. 7 should succeed even before this court. The appeals must, therefore, fail, and we hereby dismiss the same. 22. Having dismissed the appeals, we realise that an unusual situation has arisen in this case because of the university’s conduct. Though the appellant was appointed in contravention of Rule 6 of the 2001 Rules, she continued in office during the subsistence of the writ proceedings. When the Ld. Single judge allowed respondent no. 7’s writ petition and set aside the appellant’s appointment dated 27.12.2019, the appellant approached the Division Bench and obtained a stay. After the Division Bench affirmed the Ld. Single Judge’s and dismissed the writ appeal, she approached this court and again obtained a stay, and this is operating till date. In other words, the appellant’s appointment dated 27.12.2019 is continuing till date without any interruption. She has been working for almost four and a half years. On the other hand, the wrongful denial of appointment to respondent no. 7 was addressed by the Ld. [2024] 6 S.C.R. 483 Chaitra Nagammanavar v. State of Karnataka & Ors. Single Judge and Division Bench of the High Court by setting aside the appellant’s appointment, and also directing that respondent no. 7 must be given the appointment instead. While we have agreed that respondent no. 7 must succeed and be restituted to the rightful position that he had earned, the university must also address the concern of the appellant. The unfortunate situation has arisen not because of anything wrong attributable to the appellant, but due to the indifferent manner with which the university conducted itself. In to obviate the injustice caused to the appellant, the university may consider creating a supernumerary post to accommodate her. We are fully conscious of the limitations in creating such posts over and above the positions that are borne by a cadre,9 but this is an extraordinary situation for exercising such discretion.10 We leave it to the university to take a decision on this issue and pass the necessary s. 23. For the reasons stated above, the Civil Appeal Nos. 6772-6773/2023 against the and final dated 12.03.2021 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in Writ Appeal No. 233 of 2021 c/w Writ Appeal No. 190 of 2021 (S-RES) are dismissed, subject to the observations made in the previous paragraph. 24. There shall be no as to costs. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey 9 Official Liquidator v. Dayanand (2008) 10 SCC 1 10 N.T. Bevin Katti v.
