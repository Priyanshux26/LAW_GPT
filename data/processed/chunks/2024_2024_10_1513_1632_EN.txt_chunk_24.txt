Child Marriage in India: Socio-legal and human Rights Dimensions. Oxford University Press, 2nd ed. (2012) 41. 63 ‘CMRA’ 1546 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports one month or a fine of one thousand rupees or both. Grooms between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one were to be punished only with a fine and no imprisonment could be awarded to them. The CMRA originally did not allow for the punishment of a ‘child’ for the offence of child marriage. The Act only penalised child marriages which had already taken place. However, it did not stipulate any provision for the prevention of child marriage. 35. In 1938, the CMRA was amended to stipulate that a court may issue an injunction prohibiting a child marriage from taking place. However, before issuing such an injunction, the court was required to give prior notice to the person sought to be injuncted as well as an opportunity to show cause against the issuance of the injunction.64 The CMRA further underwent substantive amendments in 1949. 36. The amendment increased the age for a girl child to fifteen years and increased penalties for all categories of offenders. A chart of all the penalties under the CMRA and its amendments is produced below: Offender Penalty under the Original CMRA 1949 Amendment Groom between the Fine of upto Rs 1,000/- Simple imprisonment ages of 18-21 upto 15 days or/and a fine upto Rs 1,000/- Groom above the age Simple imprisonment Simple imprisonment of 21 upto 1 month or/and fine upto 3 months and fine upto Rs 1,000/- One who knowingly Simple imprisonment Simple imprisonment performs, conducts or upto 1 month or/and fine upto 3 months and fine directs child marriage upto Rs 1,000/- One who, being in Simple imprisonment Simple imprisonment charge of a minor – upto 1 month or/and fine upto 3 months and fine promotes, permits or upto Rs 1,000/- failed to prevent the child marriage One who knowingly Imprisonment of either Imprisonment of either violates an injunction description upto three description upto three against a child marriage months or/and fine upto months or/and fine upto Rs 1,000/- Rs 1,000/- 64 Section 12, CMRA. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1547 Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. 37. None of these offences were cognizable in nature. The offences under the CMRA were only made party cognizable through an amendment in 1978. Accordingly, the offences under the CMRA were to be treated as cognizable for (i) the purpose of investigation, and (ii) for the purpose of matters other than (a) Section 42 of CrPC and (b) the arrest of a person without a warrant or without an of the Magistrate. By the same amendment, Parliament also raised the age of marriage to eighteen years for girls and twenty-one years for boys. This time too, legislative intervention was largely animated by a concern for population control rather than the autonomy or agency of children. The Statement of Objects and Reasons expressly stated the intent behind the amendment.
