It cannot be concluded that the petitioner was not ready or willing to perform his part of the contract merely because the balance sale consideration was due to be paid. 42. Section 10, before the amendment in 2018 stated that the Court can exercise its discretion to award specific performance of contract where (a) there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused by the non-performance of the act agreed to be done; or (b) when the act agreed to be done is such that compensation in money for its non-performance would not afford adequate relief. The Explanation provided that unless there is anything to the contrary, the court shall presume that the compensation in money is not an adequate relief for the breach of a contract to transfer immovable property. There is nothing in the agreements to sell to rebut this statutory presumption. On an application of the facts to the principles in Sections 10 and 16 of the Specific Relief Act,we are of the considered opinion that this is a fit case for this Court to exercise its discretion to direct specific performance.
