[Paras 16, 19, 21-25] Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – s.20 – Presumption u/s.20, when attracted – Relevance of adequacy of consideration to draw the presumption: Held: Reference to sub section (3) to s. 20 regarding the triviality of the gratification, the act sought or performed, and the amount demanded cannot be considered in isolation to each other – Value of gratification is to be considered in proportion to the act to be done or not done, to forbear or to not forebear, favour or disfavour sought, so as to be trivial to convince the Court, not to draw any presumption of corrupt practice – It is also not necessary that only if substantial amount is demanded, the presumption can be drawn – Overall circumstances and the evidence will also have to be looked into – s.20 would come into operation only when there is no nexus between the demand and the action performed or sought to be performed – But, when the fact of receipt of payment or an agreement to receive the gratification stands proved, there is a clear case of nexus or corroboration and the presumption itself is irrelevant – s.20 gets attracted when it is proved that the public servant has accepted or agreed to accept any gratification other than legal remuneration and, in that case, presumption is that it is the motive or reward for any of the acts covered u/ss.7, 11 or 13(1)(b) of the Act.
