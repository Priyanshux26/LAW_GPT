In the facts of the case, delay post the rejection of the mercy petitions will have to be treated as executive delay as there was a gross delay in doing the ministerial act of issuing execution warrants. 19. The learned counsel also submitted that the finding of the High Court regarding keeping the convicts in solitary confinement is just and proper, and no interference is called for with that finding. 588 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports CONSIDERATION LEGAL POSITION 20. Law on the subject has been laid down in the case of Triveniben3 by a Constitution Bench. G.L. Oza, J. rendered the main opinion for himself and on behalf of three other Hon’ble Judges. The controversy which led to a reference to the Constitution Bench has been set out in the majority in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, which read thus: “1. These matters came up before us because of the conflict in the two decisions of this Court: (i) T.V. Vatheeswaran v. State of T.N. [(1983) 2 SCC 68: 1983 SCC (Cri) 342 : (1983) 2 SCR 348], Sher Singh v. State of Punjab [(1983) 2 SCC 344 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 461 : (1983) 2 SCR 582] and observations in the case of Javed Ahmed Abdul Hamid Pawala v. State of Maharashtra [(1985) 1 SCC 275: 1984 SCC (Cri) 653 : (1985) 2 SCR 8]. In Vatheeswaran case [(1983) 2 SCC 68 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 342 : (1983) 2 SCR 348] a Bench of two Judges of this Court held that two years delay in execution of the sentence after the of the trial court will entitle the condemned prisoner to ask for commutation of his sentence of death to imprisonment for life. The court observed that: [SCC p. 79 : SCC (Cri) p. 353, para 21] ‘Making all reasonable allowance for the time necessary for appeal and consideration of reprieve, we think that delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death.’ 2. In Sher Singh case [(1983) 2 SCC 344 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 461 : (1983) 2 SCR 582] which was a decision of a three-Judges’ Bench it was held that a condemned prisoner has a right of fair procedure at all stages, trial, sentence and incarceration but delay alone is not good enough for commutation and two years rule could not be laid down in cases of delay. It was held that the court in the context of the nature of offence and delay could consider the question [2024] 12 S.C.R. 589 State of Maharashtra & Ors. v. Pradeep Yashwant Kokade & Anr. of commutation of death sentence. The court observed: [SCC p. 356 : SCC (Cri) p. 473, para 19] ‘Apart from the fact that the rule of two years runs in the teeth of common experience as regards the time generally occupied by proceedings in the High Court, the Supreme Court and before the executive authorities, we are of the opinion that no absolute or unqualified rule can be laid down that in every case in which there is a long delay in the execution of a death sentence, the sentence must be substituted by the sentence of life imprisonment.
