[Paras 61, 74, 77, 84] Education – Examination – National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) (UG) 2024 – Conduct of NTA, a cause of concern: Held: The paper was leaked in Patna and Hazaribagh – In one of the centres, the rear door of the strongroom was opened and unauthorised persons were permitted to access the question papers – This indicates that there is a serious lapse in security and that security measures which are stringent and effective must be implemented by NTA – Further, it came to light that the question papers were sometimes transported in e-rickshaws and that the services of private courier companies were availed – NTA did not specify a time by which the OMR sheets were required to be sealed after the conclusion of the exam – Another point of concern is that NTA relies on persons over whom it does not exercise direct oversight to be the invigilators for the exam – There are various methods which may be adopted to ensure appropriate oversight over invigilators and decrease the likelihood of the use of unfair means – In at least twelve centres, the question paper stored in Canara Bank was wrongly distributed to candidates – The question paper which should have been distributed was the one stored in [2024] 8 S.C.R. 47 Vanshika Yadav v. Union of India & Ors. SBI – In many centres, aspirants completed the incorrect question paper and were ultimately evaluated while in others, the relevant authorities realised the mistake and then distributed the correct question paper – NTA must consider the various possibilities and plan the protocol to be followed after careful consideration – The use of mobile applications to communicate with the relevant parties would permit real-time communication and allow NTA to inform the banks even a few minutes before the time at which the city coordinator was authorised to collect the papers – When the results were released, it appeared that sixty-seven aspirants had scored a perfect score of 720 / 720 – After the removal of the compensatory marks and the conduct of the re-test for 1563 candidates and also resolving a question in controversy in the paper by an earlier dated 23.07.2024, the number of scorers with 720/720 marks then dropped to seventeen – Same is a matter of serious concern that this number fell from sixty-seven to seventeen during the course of the hearing – The intervention of the Court, reports by the media, and representations by candidates ensured that these changes were made in the interests of fairness and justice – However, the system adopted by NTA should be such that just outcomes are reached even when these external catalysts are not present – Therefore, the NTA is directed to ensure that all the concerns highlighted by the Court in this are addressed. [Paras 96, 97, 98, 99, 102] Education – Examination – National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) (UG) 2024 – Committee constituted by the Union Government: Held: The formation of a committee is essential to thoroughly investigate and address the structural issues – A dedicated committee with suitably qualified experts can ensure a comprehensive review of the security measures, candidate verification processes, and the overall management of the examination – By identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities, such a committee will help restore trust in the examination system and implement robust safeguards to prevent future malpractice – The Union Government has constituted a seven-member expert committee – The remit of the Committee, in addition to the tasks that it has been entrusted with by the Union government and the NTA, shall encompass the following: (a) Examination Security and Administration; (b) Data Security and Technological Enhancements; (c) Policy and Stakeholder Engagement; (d) Collaboration and International Cooperation; (e) Support and Training.
