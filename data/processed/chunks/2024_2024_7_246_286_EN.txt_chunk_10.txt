Digital Supreme Court Reports cannot ordinarily be re-assessed by the Court, having already been considered by an expert body19. 21. The certification of the film in question is not in issue before us. In that regard, as the High Court has noted, the appellant has not contested Sony Pictures’ reply to their legal notice. During the course of the hearing it was stated across the Bar that since the film has been released in the meantime, the certification itself is not seriously in challenge. The appellant has sought the framing of guidelines and inclusion of recommendations for creators to follow while dealing with sensitive subjects such as the rights of persons with disabilities in the visual media. II. Article 19(1)(a) and The Cinematograph Act 22. A filmmaker’s right to exhibit films is a part of their fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a), which is subject to reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2)20. The Cinematograph Act is an instance of reasonable restrictions on this right under the ‘decency and morality’ rubric of Article 19(2).21 Prior certification under the Act has been regarded as a valid restraint on cinematic speech because of its ‘instant appeal’ and the ability to stir emotions more deeply than other artistic media.22 Even so, like restraints on cinematic speech have to be narrowly construed because of their potential to imperil the significant value of free speech which is a constitutionally protected value. 23. In KA Abbas v. Union of India 23, this Court underlined that restraints on cinematic expression have to be extremely narrow.24 The Court held that when determining the effect of a film, the Board must view it from the vantage of an ordinary person of common sense rather than 19 Union of India v.
