Thus, the defect in the car was clearly established so far as non-deployment of frontal airbags was concerned. 37. Incomplete disclosure or non-disclosure of the complete details with regard to the functioning of the airbags at the time of promotion of the car, has rightly been considered by the National Commission as the “unfair trade practice” on the part of the appellants, and awarded 442 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs towards it. The National Commission has also rightly balanced the equity by awarding Rs. 5 lakhs only towards the deficiency in service on account of the frontal airbags of the car having not deployed at the time of accident. 38. Since the National Commission has considered in detail the evidence and the material on record adduced by the both the parties, in our opinion the well-considered dated 11th September 2017 passed by the National Commission does not warrant any interference. 39. It is needless to say that a trade practice which for the purpose of promoting the sale of any goods by adopting deceptive practice like falsely representing that the goods are of a particular standard, quality, style or model, would amount to “unfair trade practice” within the meaning of Section 2(1)(r) of the said Act. 40. In that view of the matter, following is passed: - I. C.A. No. 353/2008 The respondent-complainant is permitted to retain the car bearing registration no. DL-9CV-5555. The appellant is directed to refund Rs. 36,00,000/- (Rupees thirty-six lakhs) to the respondent by way of compensation within three months from the date of this , failing which the appellant shall pay interest at the rate of 9% per annum thereon from the date of this till payment. The Appeal stands partly allowed. II. C.A. No. 19536 & 19537/2017 and C.A. No. 2633/2018 All the three Appeals are dismissed. Result of the case: C.A. No. 353/2008 partly allowed. C.A. No. 19536 and 19537/2017 and C.A. No. 2633/2018 dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
