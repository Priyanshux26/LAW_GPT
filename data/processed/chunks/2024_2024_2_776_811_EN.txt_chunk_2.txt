[Para 29] Penal Code, 1860 – s. 302 – Prosecution case that victim- deceased went to picnic along with PW-2 and PW-3 – On their return, they were intercepted by appellant with a knife, who inflicted two fatal blows on the chest and stomach of the victim – Prosecution sought to bring home the guilt of the appellant primarily in the form of: (a) dying declaration, (b) eye witnesses, (c) recovery and (d) alleged arrest of the appellant nearer to the scene of the offence – Trial Court convicted [2024] 2 S.C.R. 779 Shailesh Kumar v. State of U.P. (Now State of Uttarakhand) appellant u/s. 302 IPC and sentenced him to imprisonment for life – High Court confirmed the conviction – Propriety: Held: The victim-deceased was first examined by the PW-5 (who was working in the hospital) – The presence of PW-1 (father of deceased) before PW-5 is extremely doubtful – His presence was not spoken to at all by PW-5 – The evidence of PW-1 is quite unnatural as he has neither spoken about the motive in his statement recorded u/s. 161 of CrPC, nor about the so-called dying declaration which was not even witnessed by PW-5 – PW-5 has clearly stated that the deceased was in a very serious condition, blood was oozing out and, therefore, he could not give adequate treatment – The deceased was immediately referred to the second hospital – The testimony of PW-1 is also contradictory to PW-3 and PW-8 (doctor who examined deceased in the second hospital) – Similarly, evidences of PW-2 and PW-3 cannot be relied upon, PW-2 admittedly was not examined by PW-11 (investigating officer) for over 2 weeks, for which no explanation was given – This witness also stated that he was not the friend of the deceased, therefore, his presence at the place of occurrence creates a serious doubt as to how he happened to accompany the deceased to the picnic spot – PW-3, though accompanied the deceased, was not present thereafter, as deposed by PW-5 and did not admit the deceased to the second hospital as deposed by PW-8 – The prosecution has not chosen to examine the driver of the vehicle i.e the tempo in which the deceased was taken to the hospital – There is no explanation as to how PW-9-another police officer from different jurisdiction authored the inquest report – Also, it is totally unbelievable for PW-6 to reach the place of occurrence out of inquisitiveness – The arrest of the accused at the instance of PW-7 is yet another instance of the prosecution trying to make out a case – It is incomprehensible that the appellant would be present at the place of the occurrence when he is attempting to flee – Similar logic goes to the recovery of the knife, it was found in an open place – On perusal of the case diary, it was found various corrections had been made, while some pages were even missing – A clear attempt is made to correct the dates – When the trial court perused the case diary for the purpose of contradicting the statement of a police officer, it ought not to have fixed the onus on the appellant – It has failed to discharge its duty enshrined u/s.
