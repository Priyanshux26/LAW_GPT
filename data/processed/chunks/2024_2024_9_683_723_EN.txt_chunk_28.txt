This Court in Manish Sisodia referred to and relied upon the aforesaid decision and reiterated the salutary principle that bail is the rule and jail is the exception. This Court has observed that even in straightforward open and shut cases, bail is not being granted by the trial courts and by the High Courts. It has been held as under: 53. The Court further observed that, over a period of time, the trial courts and the High Courts have forgotten a very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment. From our experience, we can say that it appears that the trial courts and the High Courts attempt to play safe in matters of grant of bail. The principle that bail is a rule and refusal is an exception is, at times, followed in breach. On account of non-grant of bail even in straight forward open and shut cases, this Court is flooded with huge number of bail petitions thereby adding to the huge pendency. It is high time that the trial courts and the High Courts should recognize the principle that “bail is rule and jail is exception”. 39. Bail jurisprudence is a facet of a civilised criminal justice system. An accused is innocent until proven guilty by a competent court following the due process. Hence, there is presumption of innocence. Therefore, 7 [1978] 2 SCR 371 : (1978) 1 SCC 240 [2024] 9 S.C.R. 723 Arvind Kejriwal v. Central Bureau of Investigation this Court has been reiterating again and again the salutary principle that bail is the rule and jail is the exception. As such, the courts at all levels must ensure that the process leading to and including the trial does not end up becoming the punishment itself. 40. This Court has emphasized and re-emphasized time and again that personal liberty is sacrosanct. It is of utmost importance that trial courts and the High Courts remain adequately alert to the need to protect personal liberty which is a cherished right under our Constitution. 41. That being the position and having regard to the discussions made above, I am of the unhesitant view that the belated arrest of the appellant by the CBI is unjustified and the continued incarceration of the appellant in the CBI case that followed such arrest has become untenable. 42. In the circumstances, the and of the High Court dated 05.08.2024 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 1939 of 2024 is clarified to the above context while the and of the High Court dated 05.08.2024 in Bail Application No. 2285 of 2024 is set aside. 43. Consequently, it is directed that the appellant shall be released on bail forthwith in the CBI case i.e. RC No. 0032022A0053 dated 17.08.2022. In so far bail conditions are concerned, this Court in the ED case i.e. in Criminal Appeal No. 2493 of 2024 has imposed several terms and conditions including clauses (b) and (c) vide the s dated 10.05.2024 and 12.07.2024 which have been incorporated in clause (d) of paragraph 47(ii) of the delivered by Justice Surya Kant.
