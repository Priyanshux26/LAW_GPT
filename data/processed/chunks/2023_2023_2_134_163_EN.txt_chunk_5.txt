of Chhattisgarh, who had worked on contract as the Director, Communication and Capacity Development Unit (CCDU), Department of Public Health Engineering, Govt. of G Chhattisgarh from 14th November, 2005 to 31st March, 2015, and as Director, ICE & Capacity Building, Dept. of Panchayat & Rural Development, Govt. of Chhattisgarh from 1st April, 2015 to 10th December, 2018] and his family were involved in corruption and money laundering, and that he also held assets which are disproportionate to his known sources of income. H THE STATE OF CHATTISGARH & ANR. v. AMAN KUMAR 141 SINGH & ORS. ETC. ETC [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] 4. Upon the complaint being received, the Chief Minister by a A handwritten directed the Chief Secretary of the State to have the complaint enquired into by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW). Although, the date “14th OCT, 2019” appears just above the handwritten of the Chief Minister, it is not too clear whether he made such on 14th October, 2019 or on 15th October, 2019. B 5. Be that as it may, vide a forwarding letter dated 21st October, 2019, the complaint was forwarded by the General Administration Department of the State (hereafter ‘GAD’, for short) to the Economic Offences Wing/Anti-Corruption Bureau (hereafter ‘ACB/ EOW’, for short) for the purpose of conducting inquiry into the allegations leveled C therein. Acting in furtherance of the said letter dated 21st October, 2019, the ACB/EOW registered a preliminary inquiry bearing no. P.E.35/2019. 6. Prior to these developments, YS had invoked the writ jurisdiction of the High Court by instituting a writ petition [W.P. (S)6521/2019], essentially questioning a departmental inquiry initiated against her. She D had prayed for quashing and/or setting aside of an dated 10th May, 2019 whereby the GAD had instituted an inquiry against her. Such inquiry appears to have been initiated on the basis of a complaint dated 12th April, 2019 lodged by one Vikas Tiwari (spokesperson of the Chhattisgarh unit of the Indian National Congress party). With the initiation of P.E.35/ 2019, in terms of the letter dated 21st October, 2019, YS filed an interim E application (I.A.04/2020) seeking a stay thereof. By an dated 16th January, 2020, the High Court directed the State not to take any steps to her prejudice pursuant to the letter dated 21st October, 2019. The of 16th January, 2020 refers to, inter alia, an earlier dated 21st October, 2019 which, however, is not on record. F 7. The letter dated 21st October, 2019 of the GAD, referred to above, was also challenged by AS by instituting a writ petition [WPCR 88/2020] before the High Court on 29th January, 2020. In such writ petition, AS urged the court to pass an for production of the entire records pertaining to the letter dated 21st October, 2019 for its perusal, for quashing G the said letter as well as any consequential step/action taken by the State including P.E.No.35/2019. 8. During the pendency of WPCR 88/2020, the FIR was registered against AS and YS. H 142 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R.
