Thus, the expression “as the case may be” in Section 18(5) must be read to mean that a copy of the of TDSAT must be given to AERA even if it is not a party to the appeal or the dispute. The expression cannot be interpreted to impliedly exclude AERA as a respondent in the appeals against its s before TDSAT. 66. Section 31 does not expressly confer AERA with the right to file an appeal against the of TDSAT before this Court. In fact, it does not confer that power to any party expressly. As Mr Datar put it, there are three ways in which provisions dealing with statutory appeal are [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1447 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. drafted. First, the provision may not prescribe who can file an appeal such as Section 31 of the AERA Act. Second, the provision may provide that an appeal may be preferred by a ‘person aggrieved’ such as under the Electricity Act,96 the Major Port Authorities Act 2021,97 the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 199298 and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Act 2012.99 The third category is where the statute confers ‘any party’ with the right to file an appeal as under the Companies Act 2013.100 With respect to the first of the three categories, at a minimum the parties to the appeal before first appellate body (in this case TDSAT) will have a right to file an appeal before this Court. AERA can file an appeal under Section 31 in view of our conclusion that it is a necessary party in the appeals against the tariff s issued by it. E. Conclusion 67. In view of the discussion above, the appeals filed by AERA against s of TDSAT under Section 31 of the AERA Act are maintainable. The Registry shall list the matters before the Regular Bench for adjudication of the appeals on merits. Result of the case: Matters directed to be listed before the Regular Bench. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan 96 “Section 125.
