Thus, the 1959 Act is a complete Code insofar as acquisition of the land, payment of compensation for its acquisition and settlement of disputes regarding the compensation payable therefor are concerned. As a result, by necessary implication, the Civil Court’s jurisdiction is barred from entertaining any claim in respect of that land. Moreover, once the land vests in the State free from all encumbrances, in absence of seeking a declaration qua the validity of the acquisition notifi cation, mere suit for injunction would not be maintainable. According to him, the trial court was justifi ed in dismissing the suit to the extent the land was covered by the notifi cation whereas the fi rst appellate court and the High Court committed manifest 556 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. error of law in holding the suit maintainable. In addition to the above, it was submitted that admittedly 2 bighas out of 3 bighas of the land in dispute was agricultural land, therefore, by virtue of Section 207 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 (in short, “the 1955 Act”), the suit was barred before a Civil Court and could only be fi led in a Revenue Court. 20. Regarding non-service of notice upon the owners of the land prior to the notifi cation under Section 52(1) of the 1959 Act, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that as the original Khatedars, who stood recorded in the record of rights, were served with notice of the proposed acquisition, there was substantial compliance of the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 52 of the 1959 Act. Hence, the notifi cation under sub-section (1) of Section 52 cannot be treated as void. 21. In support of his submissions, the learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance on the following decisions: (i) Ahuja Industries Ltd. v. State of Karnataka & Others15; (ii) Bhola Shanker v. The District Land Acquisition Offi cer, Aligarh and Ors16; (iii) Commissioner, Bangalore Development Authority and another v. Brijesh Reddy and another17; (iv) Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan18; and (v) Munshi Ram v. Municipal Committee, Chheharta19. Submissions on behalf of the Respondents 22. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that under sub-section (2) of Section 52 of the 1959 Act, the State Government is under an obligation to call upon the owner of the land and any other person who, in the opinion of the State Government, may be interested therein to show cause, within such time as may be specifi ed in the notice, why the 15 (2003) 5 SCC 365 16 (1973) 2 SCC 59 17 (2013) 3 SCC 66 18 AIR 1954 SC 340 19 (1979) 3 SCC 83 URBAN IMPROVEMENT TRUST, BIKANER v. GORDHAN 557 DASS (D) THROUGH LRS. [MANOJ MISRA, J.] land should not be acquired. The requirement of issuing such notice, before publishing the notifi cation under sub-section (1) of Section 52, is mandatory. In absence thereof, the notifi cation under sub-section (1) of Section 52 is void. Hence, there could be no deemed vesting under sub-section (4) of Section 52.
