(b) As to whether non-receipt of the representation and the delay in deciding the representation by the Detaining Authority and the Central Government would also affect the right of the detenu under Article 22(5) of the Constitution. (a) As to whether the non-supply of the statement of Ms. Preetha Pradeep has affected the right of the detenu to make an effective representation under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India 18. In the case of M. Ahamedkutty vs. Union of India and another (supra), this Court was considering the issue as to whether non-supply of the copies of the bail application and the bail vitiated the right of the detenu under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India. After taking the survey of the earlier s, this Court observed thus: “19. The next submission is that of non-supply of the bail application and the bail . This Court, as was observed in Mangalbhai Motiram Patel v. State of Maharashtra [(1980) 4 SCC 470: 1981 SCC (Cri) 49: (1981) 1 SCR 852] has ‘forged’ certain procedural safeguards for citizens under preventive detention. The 324 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports constitutional imperatives in Article 22(5) are twofold: (1) The detaining authority must, as soon as may be, i.e. as soon as practicable, after the detention communicate to the detenu the grounds on which the of detention has been made, and (2) the detaining authority must afford the detenu the earliest opportunity of making the representation against the of detention. The right is to make an effective representation and when some documents are referred to or relied on in the grounds of detention, without copies of such documents, the grounds of detention would not be complete. The detenu has, therefore, the right to be furnished with the grounds of detention along with the documents so referred to or relied on. If there is failure or even delay in furnishing those documents it would amount to denial of the right to make an effective representation. This has been settled by a long line of decisions: Ramachandra A. Kamat v. Union of India [(1980) 2 SCC 270 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 414 : (1980) 2 SCR 1072], Frances Coralie Mullin v. W.C. Khambra [(1980) 2 SCC 275 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 419 : (1980) 2 SCR 1095], Ichhu Devi Choraria v. Union of India [(1980) 4 SCC 531 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 25 : (1981) 1 SCR 640], Pritam Nath Hoon v. Union of India [(1980) 4 SCC 525 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 19 : (1981) 1 SCR 682], Tushar Thakker v. Union of India [(1980) 4 SCC 499 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 13], Lallubhai Jogibhai Patel v. Union of India [(1981) 2 SCC 427 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 463], Kirit Kumar Chaman Lal Kundaliya v. Union of India [(1981) 2 SCC 436 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 471] and Ana Carolina D’Souza v. Union of India [1981 Supp SCC 53 (1) : 1982 SCC (Cri) 131 (1)]. 20. It is immaterial whether the detenu already knew about their contents or not.
