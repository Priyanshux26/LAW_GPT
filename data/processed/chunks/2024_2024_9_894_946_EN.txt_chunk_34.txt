81. We also prima facie find force in the contention of the petitioner AMP Group that the nomenclature of the agreement is not determinative of its character as held by this Court in Sasan Power Ltd. (supra). Therefore, the fact that the underlying contract is called the “Family Arrangement Agreement” by itself may not preclude the impleadment of the SRG Group in arbitration. 82. Once the arbitral tribunal is constituted, it shall be open for the respondents to raise all the available objections in law, and it is only after (and if) the preliminary objections are rejected that the tribunal shall proceed to adjudicate the claims of the Petitioners. 946 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports F. CONCLUSION 83. In view of the aforesaid, the present petition is allowed. We appoint Mr. Akil Kureshi (Former Chief Justice, High Court of Rajasthan) to act as the sole arbitrator. The fees of the arbitrator including other modalities shall be fixed in consultation with the parties. 84. It is made clear that all the rights and contentions of the parties are left open for adjudication by the learned arbitrator. 85. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
