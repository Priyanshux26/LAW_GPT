[Para 24] Practice and Procedure – Plaintiff cannot be allowed to surpass limitation by way of vague and clever drafting: Held: It is evident that the plaintiff purposely drafted/filed a vague plaint which lacked the essential details of when the hospital was constructed, when the plaintiff became aware of such construction, when the right of ownership devolved upon the plaintiff, when his father passed away, his letter of 24.04.1981 to the Tehsildar etc; the first date and document mentioned in the plaint is of the legal notice dated 09.11.2000 – It is nothing but a clear attempt by Respondent at surpassing the bar under limitation law for filing the suit since the existence of the hospital was a fact well known to him since long ago. [Paras 16, 17, 18] Suit for possession – Burden of proof lies on the Plaintiff: Held: As per Section 110 of the Evidence Act, 1872, the burden of proof as to ownership of a property lies on the person challenging the ownership of the person in possession – In view of the clear finding that the hospital is functioning on the suit land since 1958, the Trial Court as well as the High Court have wrongly shifted the proof of ownership on the Appellant, whereas it lay on the Respondent by virtue of Section 110. [Paras 30, 31, 32] 2436 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Revenue Record – Entry in revenue records would not confer any title on the Plaintiff – Rights conferred on the Appellant/State under the gift deed cannot be taken away: Held: Merely because the name of the Plaintiff continued in the revenue records (Jama Bandis), it would not confer any title upon him – Revenue records are only entries for the purpose of realising tax by the Municipal Corporations or land revenue by Gram Sabhas – The documents exhibited by the defendants could not be ignored as they were public documents, copies of which were filed and duly proved that the hospital was functional much before 1981 – Even if the gift deed was not placed on record, due explanation was given – The lethargy/ carelessness on the part of the State in not getting the revenue records corrected on the basis of the gift deed would not take away the rights conferred on the State under the gift deed.
