Dir., Acharya Balkrishna & Baba Ramdev in The Matter of: Indian Medical Asso. and another v. Union of India and others Held: Any apology tendered by a party in contempt proceedings must be unconditional and unqualified – Such an apology must also demonstrate that it has been made with a bona fide intention and not just to wriggle out of a tight situation – There cannot be a justification and an apology – The two things are incompatible and do not go hand-in-hand – In the present case, though the proposed contemnor purportedly tendered an unqualified apology on behalf of Patanjali for the breach of statement recorded in the dated 21.11.2023, the said affidavit was rejected as the deponent had tried to justify his conduct by seeking to offer an explanation for the advertisements issued, which is impermissible – Thus, the conditional apology tendered by the proposed contemnor was rejected.
