B 12. The direction given herein above shall be carried out within a period of three months from today.” 10.It appears that while allowing the writ petition of Mr. Nair, the Division Bench of the High Court followed the earlier view expressed C by its coordinate Bench. 11.Mr. Nair had applied for a review4 of the and dated 16th June, 2014 on the ground that the High Court had erred in not clarifying the position on grace marks and in not addressing his claim of qualification/seniority from the date of eligibility. When the same was taken up for consideration on 31st October, 2014, the High Court was D informed of issuance of notice by this Court on the petition for special leave to appeal filed by the RBI. In view thereof, without examining the merits of the review petition, the same was disposed of by the High Court with liberty to Mr. Nair to seek revival after disposal of the proceedings before this Court. E BROAD OVERVIEW OF THE LAW: 12.Much water has flown under the bridge since the impugned dated 16th June, 2014 was rendered by the High Court. On the legislative front, the Parliament enacted the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the PwD Act, 2016’) F repealing the PwD Act, 1995. On the judicial side, pronouncements in Rajiv Kumar Gupta and Ors. vs. Union of India and Ors.5,Siddaraju vs. State of Karnataka and ors.6, and State of Kerala and Ors. vs. Leesamma Joseph7 have seen the light of the day. The executive, in its turn, has complied with the directions contained in an dated G 28th September, 2021 of this Court8 arising out of Siddaraju (supra) 4 RP No. 55 of 2014 5 (2016) 13 SCC 153 6 (2020) 19 SCC 572 7 (2021) 9 SCC 208 H 8 M.A. 2171/2020 in Civil Appeal No.1567/2017 RESERVE BANK OF INDIA & ORS. v. A.K. NAIR & ORS. 791 [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] resulting in issuance of OM dated 17th May, 2022 by the DoPT. These A are undoubtedly developments subsequent to the impugned ; but since they could have a bearing on the merits of Mr. Nair’s claim that he has unjustly been deprived of promotion to the post of Assistant Manager, the same cannot be kept out of our consideration. Indeed, after OM dated 17th May, 2022 was issued, the RBI has also issued a B circular dated December 8, 2022 conveying its decision to reserve 16 (sixteen) vacancies for persons with disabilities out of 600 (six hundred) vacancies on the post of Assistant Manager Grade - ‘A’, to be filled up by a departmental examination scheduled on 10th December, 2022. 13.The law relating to grant of equal opportunities, protection of C rights, and full participation of persons with disabilities was codified by the PwD Act, 1995. Chapter VI of the PwD Act, 1995, titled ‘EMPLOYMENT’, containing sections 32 to 41, inter alia, mandated identification of posts which could be reserved for persons with disabilities for appointment, the extent of reservation and the procedure to be followed in the matter of recruitment.
