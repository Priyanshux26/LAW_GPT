450 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 61. Given the attendant facts and circumstances of the case and the effort made by the proposed contemnors to absolve themselves of acts that amounted to breach of undertakings given to this Court, we are inclined to accept the apology tendered by them and close the matter. At the same time, they are cautioned to strictly abide by the terms of their undertakings. Any future intransigence on their part, whether by act, deed or speech that could tantamount to violating the s of the Court or dishonouring the terms of the undertakings, shall be viewed strictly and the ensuing consequences could indeed be grave. In that eventuality, the sword of contempt that has now been returned to rest in its sheath, shall be flourished as swiftly as these proceedings were originally initiated. 62. With the aforesaid s, the present proceedings are closed and the notice to show cause issued to the proposed contemnors is discharged. Result of the case: Contempt proceedings closed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
