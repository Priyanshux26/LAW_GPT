In view of the same, learned senior counsel for the respondents contend that there is no scope for interference with the concurrent s of the Courts below. Question for consideration: 37. In the above background, the question that arises for consideration is: Whether the press release of 01.10.2009 announcing the decision of the Union Cabinet about approval of certain modifications [2024] 11 S.C.R. 473 Nabha Power Limited & Anr. v. Punjab State Power Coroporation Limited & Anr. envisaged in the then existing mega power policy, is covered within the meaning of the expression “law as defined in Clause 1.1 of the RFP/PPA and if so did the extant legal regime as on 01.10.2009 undergo a change from the said date”? Analysis and reasons: 38. The appellant’s case, as set out above, is that with the press release on 01.10.2009, a new legal regime commences and on that basis, it is contended that the appellant in its bid of 09.10.2009 factored the altered position including the fiscal benefits due to customs duty exemptions. The respondent’s case is that the press release of 01.10.2009 only sets out the proposal for modification and the real modification happened on 11.12.2009 and 14.12.2009 (preceded by the letter of 03.12.2009). According to them, since the change of law having happened on 11.12.2009/14.12.2009 the benefits that have accrued to the appellant ought to be passed on. This is the simple issue to be resolved. 39. To answer this question, certain clauses from RFP needs to be set out. The RFP carried the format of the power purchase agreement as Format 1 Annexure 3. There is no dispute that the same clauses occurred in the power purchase agreement executed on 18.01.2010. Clause 1.1 defines law as under : “Law: means, in relation to this Agreement, all laws including Electricity Laws in force in India and any statute, ordinance, regulation, notification or code, rule, or any interpretation of any of them by an Indian Governmental Instrumentality and having force of law and shall further include all applicable rules, regulations, s notifications by an Indian Governmental Instrumentality pursuant to or under any of them and shall include all rules, regulations, decisions and s of the Appropriate Commission.” 40. The relevant Clauses read as under:- “13 ARTICLE 1.3 Change in Law 13.1 Definitions In this Article 13, the following terms shall have the following meanings. 474 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 13.1.1 “ Change in Law” means the occurrence of any of the following events after the date, which is seven (7) days prior to the Bid Deadline; (i) the enactment, bringing into effect, adoption, promulgation, amendment, modification or repeal, of any law or (ii) a change in interpretation of any law by a competent court of law, tribunal or Indian Governmental instrumentality provided such Court of law, tribunal or Indian Governmental Instrumentality is final authority under law for such interpretation or (iii) change in any consents approvals or licenses available or obtained for the project, otherwise than for default of the seller, which results in any change in any cost of or revenue from the business of selling electricity by the seller to the procurer under the terms of this agreement or (iv) any change in the (a) declared price of land for the project or (b) the cost of implementation of the resettlement and rehabilitation package of the land for the project mentioned in the RFP or (c) the cost of implementing environmental management plan for the power station (d) deleted.
