The further deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs was made pursuant to an interim of the High Court dated 03.06.2011, which stayed the Trial Court dated 02.04.2011 and directed the deposit. However, unlike the previous , neither was this passed on the consent of the parties nor did it permit the respondent to withdraw the money during the pendency of the proceedings. Rather, it directed that the amount shall be deposited in a fixed deposit receipt and shall be disbursed to the successful party on the final adjudication of the objections. 11.2 We will first deal with the deposit of Rs. 7.5 crores. Despite being permitted to withdraw this amount by furnishing a bank guarantee, the respondent did not do so until 2016. Mr. Mahajan contended that being a foreign company, it was unable to obtain a bank guarantee from an Indian bank. However, the of 15.10.2010 clearly records the respondent’s consent to this condition. Further, when it was unable to comply with the same, it also did not apply for a modification or removal of the condition. Hence, the respondent, in its own discretion, did not withdraw Rs. 7.5 crores when it was deposited in 2010. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 313 DLF Ltd. (Formerly Known as DLF Universal Ltd) and Anr. v. Koncar Generators and Motors Ltd. 11.3 A similar situation arose in this Court’s decision in Renusagar (supra) as well. This Court was deciding an appeal against the dismissal of Renusagar’s objections under Section 7 of the Foreign Awards Act, 1961. During the pendency of the appeal, by dated 21.02.1990, this Court stayed the operation of the High Court subject to deposit of one-half of the decretal amount calculated as on date. General Electric was permitted to withdraw the deposited amount by furnishing security by way of bank guarantee for the sum to be withdrawn in excess of Rs. 4 crores. It also directed that 10% interest p.a. would be payable by Renusagar on the balance of the decretal amount in case the appeal is dismissed, and the same interest would be payable by General Electric on the amount withdrawn by it if the appeal is allowed. Pursuant to this , Renusagar deposited Rs. 9.69 crores on 20.03.1990, which was withdrawn by the respondent on furnishing necessary bank guarantee. In a subsequent , this Court directed a further deposit of Rs. 1 crore and bank guarantee of Rs. 1.92 crores to be furnished by Renusagar. The deposit was made on 03.12.1990, which was also withdrawn.51 However, General Electric contended that it was unable to use a large part of this amount as it had not received permission from the Reserve Bank of India to convert the same into US dollars due to the pendency of the appeals. 11.4 After rejecting various submissions by the appellant regarding the enforceability of the award, this Court decided the question of the amount in Indian rupee that was to be paid. The relevant portion on this point is extracted: “141. As indicated earlier, in pursuance to the s of this Court dated February 21, 1990, Renusagar deposited a sum of Rs 9,69,26,590 on March 20, 1990 and a further amount of Rs 1,00,00,000 was deposited by Renusagar in pursuance to the dated November 6, 1990 on December 3, 1990.
