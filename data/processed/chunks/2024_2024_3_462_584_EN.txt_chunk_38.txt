43 It was agreed in 1704 that no House of Parliament shall have power, by any vote or declaration, to create new privilege that is not warranted by known laws and customs of Parliament. The symbolic petition by the Speaker of the House of Commons to the crown claiming the ‘ancient and undoubted’ privileges of the House of Commons are therefore not to be changed. 44 [1959] Suppl. 1 SCR 806 : AIR 1959 SC 395 514 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 71. In Special Refence No. 1 of 1964,45 a seven-judge Bench of this Court opined on the privileges of the State Legislature upon a Presidential reference. The reference was in the aftermath of the Speaker of the UP Legislative Assembly directing the arrest and production of two judges of the High Court. The two judges had interfered with a resolution to administer reprimand to a person who had published a pamphlet libelling one of the members of the Assembly. Gajendragadkar, CJ speaking for the majority did not disagree with the decision in MSM Sharma (supra) which held that Article 105(3) and Article 194(3) would prevail over Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. However, the Court held that Article 21 was to prevail over Articles 105(3) and 194(3) in a conflict between the two. The Court held that the Parliament or Legislature is not the sole judge of its privileges and the courts have the power to enquire if a particular privilege claimed by the legislature in fact existed or not, by consulting the privileges of the Commons. The determination of privileges, the Court held, and whether they conform to the parameters of the Constitution is a question that must be answered by the courts. This Court opined that: “37. The next question which faces us arises from the preliminary contention raised by Mr Seervai that by his appearance before us on behalf of the House, the House should not be taken to have conceded to the Court the jurisdiction to construe Article 194(3) so as to bind it. As we have already indicated, his stand is that in the matter of privileges, the House is the sole and exclusive judge at all stages. […] … 42. In coming to the conclusion that the content of Article 194(3) must ultimately be determined by courts and not by the legislatures, we are not unmindful of the grandeur and majesty of the task which has been assigned to the legislatures under the Constitution. Speaking broadly, all the legislative chambers in our country today are playing a significant role in the pursuit of the ideal of a Welfare State which has been placed by the Constitution before our 45 [1965] 1 SCR 413 : 1964 SCC OnLine SC 21 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 515 Sita Soren v. Union of India country, and that naturally gives the legislative chambers a high place in the making of history today. […]” (emphasis supplied) 72. The opinion in Special Reference No. 1 of 1964 (supra) was further affirmed by another seven-judge bench of this Court in State of Karnataka v. Union of India46 which held that whenever a question arises whether the House has jurisdiction over a matter under its privileges, the adjudication of such a claim is vested exclusively in the courts.
