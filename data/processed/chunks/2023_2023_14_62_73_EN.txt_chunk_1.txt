Ltd. seeks to assail the dated 11.05.2023 of the Delhi High Court in MAC. APP. No. 914 of 2019. Thereby, the High Court reversed the Award dated 06.07.2018 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Rohini Courts, Delhi, in MAC Petition No. 4415 of 2016, to the extent it granted the right of recovery to the petitioner- insurance company. Aggrieved by the denial of such right of recovery, the petitioner-insurance company is before this Court. 2. Facts, to the extent germane, may be noted: One Dharambir suff ered fatal injuries on 09.05.2010, when the Tempo vehicle bearing Registration No. HR69D-0246, driven in a rash and negligent manner, hit his motorcycle. His dependents, viz., his parents, widow and children, approached the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Rohini Courts, Delhi, under Sections 140 and 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for brevity, ‘the Act of 1988’), seeking compensation. Ujay Pal, the driver of the Tempo vehicle; Netra Pal Singh, the owner of the vehicle, who died during the pendency of the case and was represented by his legal representatives, viz., his mother, widow and minor son; and the petitioner-insurance company were arrayed as the respondents in their claim petition. By Award dated 06.07.2018, the Tribunal held in their favour and awarded them a sum of ₹13,70,000/- as compensation with interest. However, the Tribunal found that the driver of the Tempo had a fake driving licence and opined that the petitioner-insurance company would not be liable to pay the compensation. The Tribunal, therefore, directed the petitioner-insurance company to deposit the awarded amount with liberty to recover the same from the present owners of the Tempo. Aggrieved by this fi nding, the owners of the vehicle fi led an appeal in MAC. APP. No. 914 of 2019 before the Delhi High Court, resulting in the impugned dated 11.05.2023.
