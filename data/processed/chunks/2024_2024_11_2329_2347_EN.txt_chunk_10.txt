In the facts and circumstances of this case the High Court interfered with the pure findings of fact even after the amendment of Section 100 CPC in 1976. The High Court would not have been justified in interfering with the concurrent findings of fact in this case even prior to the amendment of Section 100 CPC. The of the High Court is clearly against the provisions of Section 100 and in no uncertain terms clearly violates the legislative intention.” (Emphasis supplied) 16.2 A Bench of three learned Judges in V. Ramachandra Ayyar v. Ramalingam Chettiar,8 as recently followed in Nazir Mohammed v. J. Kamala,9 observed :- 8 1962 SCC OnLine SC 155 9 (2020) 19 SCC 57 2346 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports “11. It is well known that as early as 1890, the Privy Council had occasion to consider this aspect of the matter in Mussummai Durga Choudhrain v. Jawahir Singh Choudhri [17 IA 122] . In that case, it was urged before the Privy Council, relying upon the decision of the Calcutta and Allahabad High Courts in Futtehma Begum v. Mohamed Ausur [ILR 9 Cal 309] and Nivath Singh v. Bhikki Singh [ILR 7 All 649] respectively, that the High Court would be within its jurisdiction in holding that where the lower appellate court has clearly misapprehended what the evidence before it was, and has been led to discard or not give sufficient weight to other evidence to which it is not entitled, the High Court can interfere under Section 100. This contention was rejected by the Privy Council and it was observed that an erroneous finding of fact is a different thing from an error or defect in procedure, and that there is no jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal on the ground of an erroneous finding of fact, however gross or inexcusable the error may seem to be. Their Lordships added that nothing can be clearer than the declaration in the Code of Civil Procedure that no second appeal will lie except on the grounds specified in Section 584 (corresponding to Section 100 of the present Code), and they uttered a word of warning that no court in India or elsewhere has power to add to or enlarge those grounds. Since 1890, this decision has been treated as a leading decision on the question about the jurisdiction of the High Court in dealing with questions of facts in second appeals.” 16.3 The principles regarding the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 have been recently summarised by this Court in Suresh Lataruji Ramteke v. Sau. Sumanbai Pandurang Petkar.10 Referring to Santosh Hazari v. Purushottam Tiwari11 it was held that a substantial question of 10 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1210 11 (2001) 3 SCC 179 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2347 Ramachandra Reddy (Dead) Thr. LRs. & Ors. v. Ramulu Ammal (Dead) Thr. LRs. law, which is sine qua non for the maintainability of a second appeal, shall be so, if:- "a) Not previously settled by law of land or a binding precedent.
