SC/ ST/OBC (without OBC Annexure)/EWS (without EWS Annexure)/ PwBD/Ex-Servicemen]and educational qualifi cation with required Examination Fee, within the prescribed time for the same. Any delay in submission of the DAF-1 or documents in support beyond the prescribed date will not be allowed and will lead to cancellation of the candidature for the CSE-2022. Eligibility for Availing Reservation: 27. (1) A candidate will be eligible to get the benefi t of community- based reservation only in case the particular community/caste to which the candidate belongs is included in the list of reserved communities issued by the Central Government. (2) The OBC candidates applying for CSE-2022 must produce OBC (Non-Creamy Layer)certifi cate based on the income for the Financial Years (FYs) 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021.

Candidates seeking reservation/relaxation benefi ts available for SC/ST/OBC/EWS/PwBD/Ex-servicemen must ensure that they are entitled to such reservation/relaxation as per eligibility prescribed in the Rules/Notice. They should also be in possession of all the requisite certifi cates in the prescribed format in support of their claim as stipulated in the Rules/Notice for such benefi ts by the closing date of the application for Civil Services(Preliminary) Examination-2022.” 54 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 7. A careful perusal of the Rules would disclose that, under Rule 28, candidates seeking reservation under EWS for the purpose of CSE-2022 must ensure that they are entitled to such reservation as per the eligibility prescribed in the Rules. The eligibility prescribed for EWS under Rule 27(3) is that the candidate should meet the criteria issued by the Central Government and should be in possession of requisite Income &Asset Certifi cate (I&AC) based on the income for Financial Year 2020-2021. Secondly, the candidates should also be in possession of all the requisite certifi cates in the prescribed format by the closing date of the application for Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination - 2022. It can be seen from the above-mentioned clauses that the benefi t of reservation can be availed on possession of Income & Asset Certifi cate [I&AC] issued by a Competent Authority. Under Clause 5.3 of the OM, the crucial date for submitting I&AC may be treated as the closing date for receipt of application for the post, except in cases where crucial date is fi xed otherwise. 8. As it would be clear from the Offi ce Memoranda dated 19.01.2019 & 31.01.2019 r/w Rule 27 & 28 of the CSE-2022 Rules, for claiming reservation under EWS category, the I&AC must be as per the prescribed norms and must be in possession of the candidate on or before the cut-off date. 9. The applicable date for possession in this case is 22.02.2022. This is because after the promulgation of the Rules, the third respondent – Union Public Service Commission [UPSC] issued the examination notice on 02.02.2022 and the last date for submission of the application was 22.02.2022 and the time of deadline was 6.00 p.m. on that day.
