v. State of Kerala, (2003) 3 SCC 355 (paragraph 12, 13); H 852 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A • Thulia Kali v. The State of Tamil Nadu, (1972) 3 SCC 393 (paragraph 12); • Mukhtiar Ahmed Ansari v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2005) 5 SCC 258; • Raja Ram v. State of Rajasthan, 2005 SCC (Cri) 1050 : B (2005) 5 SCC 272 SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENT: 27. The Learned counsel appearing for the State while acknowledging the fact that there were reportedly three first information reports, submitted that two injured witnesses have spoken about the C occurrence, of whom one was the author of the first information report. The contradictions are minor in nature, and therefore, to be eschewed. 28. The deceased Hukum Singh has made a statement before P.W.20, which has to be treated as a dying declaration. Both the Courts below concurrently found that the appellants committed the offence, D and therefore, the evidence need not be re-appreciated by this Court. DISCUSSION: Investigating Officer’s Role: 29. We have already dealt with the statement given by the E prosecution witnesses. To sum it up, we find the witnesses speak about three first information reports. Even on the recording of the statement of the deceased Hukum Singh, P.W.20, the Investigating Officer was not very clear. The discrepancy also extends to the place where the body was found when the statement was recorded. An investigating F officer is expected to act in an un-biased, fair and in a manner that is required of a public servant. His concern is to find out the truth. The suppression of the statement given by the other witnesses would obviously go to the root of the matter. One does not know the clear picture, and therefore the benefit shall be extended to the appellants. We wish to place reliance on the decision of this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh G v. Ratan Singh and Others, (2020) 12 SCC 630: “8. As emphasised by this Court in Amitbhai Anil Chandra Shah v. CBI, (2013) 6 SCC 348 : (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 309, only the earliest or the first information in regard to the commission of a cognizable offence satisfies the requirements of Section 154, and H RANVIR SINGH ETC. ETC. v. THE STATE OF MADHYA 853 PRADESH [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] consequently there cannot be a second FIR. Rather it is absurd or A ridiculous to call such information as second FIR. In Subramaniam v. State of T.N., (2009) 14 SCC 415 : (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 1392, this Court observed that if an FIR is filed after recording the statement of the witnesses, such second information would be inadmissible in evidence. Moreover, in Nallabothu Ramulu v. State B of A.P., (2014) 12 SCC 261 : (2014) 6 SCC (cri) 673, the Court was of the view that the non-treatment of statements of injured witnesses as the first information cast doubt on the prosecution version. 9. Thus, not only was there a delay in filing of the FIR (which C remained unexplained) which was taken as the basis of the investigation in this case, but also there was a wilful suppression of the actual first information received by the police.
