However, though these Regulations were promulgated, no differential treatment was meted out to the Indians as their rights were G protected under the Indo-Sikkim Treaty of 1950. 68.6. Thus, although, as per the 1961 Regulation read with the 1961 Rules, the name of the individual had to be registered before 26th April, 1975 in the Register of Sikkim Subjects, in view of the interpretation now given to the proviso to H 358 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A Regulation (3) and particularly, to the expression ‘in any other country’, as also found in Regulation (4) of the 1961 Regulation, a future cut-off date may have to be indicated by the Union of India by means of a circular or in any other manner for the purpose of enabling the registration of individuals in the Register of Sikkim Subjects who are Indian B citizens, domiciled in the territory of Sikkim on or before 26th April, 1975. This is permissible because Government dated 7th August, 1990, would indicate that every person who immediately before 26th April, 1975 was a Sikkim Subject under the 1961 Regulation shall be deemed C to have become a citizen of India on that day. The object and purpose of the issuance of the Government was to ensure that those persons who were eligible to be entered in the Register of Sikkim Subjects but were not so entered because of a genuine omission were enabled to get themselves registered and are accordingly deemed to have D become citizens of India with effect from 26th April, 1975 in terms of the Sikkim (Citizenship) , 1975. 68.7. The Sikkim (Citizenship) , 1975, as amended by the Sikkim (Citizenship) Amendment , 1989, issued by the Government of India would clearly indicate that any person E who was a Sikkim Subject under the 1961 Regulation shall be deemed to have become a citizen of India. Conversely, all citizens of India having a domicile in Sikkim on or before 26th April, 1975 must be enabled to register their names in the Register of Sikkim Subjects in to avail the benefit F of exemption under clause (26AAA) of Section 10 of the I.T. Act, 1961. This would imply that the 1961 Regulation is being extended up to 26th April, 1975 for the purpose of Explanation to Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 so as to save it from being rendered discriminatory insofar as the petitioners herein and similarly situated individuals G are concerned. 68.8. Further, under the Sikkim Work Permit Rules, 1965 every ‘foreigner’ entering Sikkim was required to obtain a work permit from the Chief Secretary or any other officer authorised by him before he could take up or continue any H ASSOCIATION OF OLD SETTLERS OF SIKKIM AND ORS. v. 359 UNION OF INDIA AND ANR. [B. V. NAGARATHNA, J.] employment for gain within the State of Sikkim. However, A under the aforesaid Rules, the definition of ‘foreigner’ included all foreigners except a citizen of India. Therefore, Indian citizens or Indian nationals who became domiciled in Sikkim and were employed in Sikkim did not require a work permit.
