It was throughout the intention of the State of Madhya Pradesh to not charge stamp duty @ 2% and treat the Concession Agreement under BOT Scheme to be a license but unfortunately for the period referred to above, it was treated as a lease and the appellants are the victims of this period, whereas all subsequent Concession Agreements under BOT Scheme executed after 10th March, 2008 are exempt from such stamp duty. 6. Further continuing his submissions Mr. Dave, learned Senior Counsel submitted that in view of the Clarification dated 01.07.2002 and subsequent circulation vide letter dated 21.07.2002 throughout the State, once it was clarified that the Concession Agreements under the BOT Projects would be executed on stamp paper of Rs.100/-, the appellants entered into the agreement with the same impression and having calculated their project cost and also their tenders without factoring in 2% stamp duty, had legitimate expectation that the agreement would not require stamp duty @ 2% of the value, but was to be executed only on stamp paper of Rs.100/-. The subsequent demand was contrary to the legitimate expectations of the appellants and, therefore, liable to be set aside. 7. It was next submitted that the Circular of the Chief Secretary dated 1st July, 2002 and its subsequent circulation vide letter dated 21st July, 2002, estopped the State Government from amending the IS 1136 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Act and, further raising the demand @ 2% treating the Concession Agreement to be a lease, the same would be hit by principle of promissory estoppel. The State was estopped from demanding such stamp duty by treating the Concession Agreement to be a lease. 8. In support of his submissions, Shri Dave has placed reliance upon the following s: (1) Navjyoti Co-op. Group Housing Society Vs. Union of India;4 (2) Food Corporation of India Vs. Kamdhenu Cattle Feed Industries;5 (3) The State of Jharkhand and Ors. Vs. Brahmputra Metallies Ltd. Ranchi and Anr. ;6 (4) State of Bihar and Ors. Vs. Shyama Nandan Mishra;7 (5) M/S Hero Moto Corp Ltd. Vs. Union of India and Ors. ;8 9. Shri Dave, learned Senior Counsel next submitted that the insertion of proviso (c) to Clause(C) under Article 33 of Schedule 1-A by the 2002 Amendment Act was ultra vires as it violates the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. It was submitted that the said amendment was illegal, arbitrary and bad in law as it nullified the promise made by the Chief Secretary, vide Circular dated 01.07.2002, and has taken away the vested right of the appellants of not factoring in 2% stamp duty and ultimately resulting into a demand of a huge amount of Rs.1,08,00,000/- (Rupees one crore eight lakhs) approximately. In support of his submission, he has relied upon the following two s: (1) State of Gujarat and another Vs. Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soni and Ors. ;9 (2) B.S. Yadav and Ors. etc. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors. Etc. ;10 4 [1992] Supp.
