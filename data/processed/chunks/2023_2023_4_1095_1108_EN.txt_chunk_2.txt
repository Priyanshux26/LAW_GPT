[Para 32][1107- C-G] F 1.5 The changes occurring on account of permitting IPT would affect AP(M)L as well as the appellants and two other DISCOMS, i.e., MSEDCL and Rajasthan DISCOMS. This was also observed by the CERC in its dated 8th July 2019. No expertise is there for working out as to what benefit any of the parties would be entitled to on account of the said ‘Change in G Law’. However, the cost of saving in the railway transportation on account of ‘Change in Law’ needs to be worked out and passed on to the appropriate DISCOMS, which can further be passed on to the consumers. CERC, which is a body of experts, is best suited to do so. [Para 33][1107-H; 1108-A-B] H 1098 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 1.6 Though the issue with regard to allowing ‘Change in Law’ compensation on the basis of ACQ – actual supply is upheld, the issue with regard to IPT not being ‘Change in Law’ is set aside. The finding of the APTEL to the effect that the communication dated 19th June 2013 providing for IPT does not amount to ‘Change in Law’ is set aside. It is held that IPT amounts B to ‘Change in Law’. [Paras 34, 35][1108-C-D] 1.7 The matter is remitted to CERC for working out the effect of the said ‘Change in Law’ after giving notice to MSEDCL as well as Rajasthan DISCOMS and hearing all the parties including the appellants and the respondents herein. However, C since the said issue has been pending since a long time, CERC is directed to decide the said issue and calculate the benefits that would be accruable to any of the parties within the stipulated period.
