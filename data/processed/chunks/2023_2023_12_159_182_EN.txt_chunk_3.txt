Vide dated 09.05.1962 passed by S.D.O., Nagpur, the revenue records were corrected and those plots were mutated in the name of the landowner. NIT required the said land for ‘Ajni Street Scheme’ (hereinafter referred to as ‘Scheme’) for which the notifi cation under Section 39 of Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936 (hereinafter 164 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. referred to as ‘NIT Act’) akin to Section 4 of the LA Act was published on 12.07.1962 specifying Khasra Nos. 35/1 and 35/2 only. The fi nal declaration under Section 45 of the NIT Act akin to Section 6 of the LA Act was published on 16.01.1969. After fi nal declaration, NIT vide letter dated 10.10.1969 requested the State for transfer of Khasra Nos. 35/1 and 35/2 to it for the Scheme, as it presumed the land to be Government Nazul land. Sometime in the year 1970, NIT constructed the road on 5390 sq. ft. of land of Khasra No. 35/8 which included plot No. 8 belonging to the land owner.
