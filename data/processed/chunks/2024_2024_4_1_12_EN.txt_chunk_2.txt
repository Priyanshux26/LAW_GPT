(Appellant & R-2 were the only found to be qualified – But the Appellant was L2) 17.12.2018 LOI was issued by the R-1 in favour of R-2. 24.12.2018 One Unsuccessful bidder Dalip S Rathore filed Writ Petition being CWP 3021 of 2018 challenging the technical specifications & ineligibility of Respondent No.2, also seeking cancellation of the Tender. The High Court issued notice. 02.01.2019 R-1 HIMUDA withdrew the LOI dated 17.12.2018 of R-2 M/S Vasu Constructions stating that the case is pending in the High Court and the work will be awarded only as per the decision of the High Court. 05.01.2019 R-1 HIMUDA constituted a committee, which reviewed the tender process and concluded that there were many lapses which warranted actions against the erring officials. 07.01.2019 Another Committee constituted by R-1 submitted a report that Shri Dalip Singh was not qualified and M/s. Vasu Constructions was qualified. 23.02.2019 Appellant – Level 9 BIZ Pvt. Ltd. filed a writ petition CWP 363 of 2019, praying for rejection of Technical Bid and Financial Bid of the R-2 M/s. Vasu Constructions [2024] 4 S.C.R. 5 Level 9 Biz Pvt. Ltd. v. Himachal Pradesh Housing and Urban Development Authority & Another 25.11.2020 High Court passed a detailed on 25.11.2020 in CWP No. 3021/2018 and 363/2019. In Para 29 High Court observed- “[..] this Court is prima facie of the view that some of the officers manning high positions in HIMUDA have not acted responsibly and in the interest of organization, rather have attempted, directly or indirectly, to give undue benefit to some of the contractors. Having seen the record, this Court is compelled to draw a conclusion that the officers responsible for evaluation of the tender in question, did not scrutinize the documents submitted by the tenderers along with their bids properly and, with a view to ensure ouster of some eligible contractors and awarding the same to their favourites, have made an attempt to justify their action by giving totally implausible reasoning.” In para 31, High Court observed- “But, for the reasons, best known to the authority, it still proceeded to award the tender in favour of M/s. Vasu Construction Company.” The High Court therefore to instill confidence in the general public and to ensure transparency in the system, constituted an independent committee to enquire into the tender process in question, and directed the committee to submit its report in a sealed cover to the Court. 02.01.2021 Committee constituted by High Court filed its report. 08.01.2021 High Court disposed of both Petitions being Nos. 3021/2018 and 363/19 and directed registry to initiate separate proceedings against erring officials, observing as under: - 6 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 14. Since the committee, after having perused the records, has arrived at a definite conclusion that on account of shortcomings/irregularities, tender in question requires to be cancelled, nothing much is left for this court to adjudicate in these matters. Leaving everything aside, learned counsel for the petitioners in both the petitions, being satisfied with the findings of enquiry committee as well as suggestions made therein, are not willing to prosecute the cases further and have prayed to dispose of the same as having been rendered infructuous.
