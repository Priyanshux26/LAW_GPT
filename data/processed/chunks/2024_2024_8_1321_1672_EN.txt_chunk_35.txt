7 SCR 142 : (1996) 6 SCC 580 1370 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 60. In T Devadasan v. Union of India,83 the majority held that a carry forward of the unfilled vacancies of the reserved category to the next year will abrogate the equal opportunity principle and impair efficiency. Justice Subba Rao while dissenting, advocated for a harmonious reading of Articles 16, 46 and 335. Laying the groundwork for the jurisprudential development in NM Thomas (supra), the learned Judge observed that the phrase “any provision” in Article 16(4) is wide enough to include the carry forward rule. The observation of the majority that carrying forward the vacancies to the subsequent year is contrary to the equal opportunity principle was line with the in Balaji (supra) because the was delivered in the pre-NM Thomas (supra) era. However, besides the narrow interpretation of the equal opportunity principle, the concept of “efficiency” also weighed with the Court. 61. By the Constitution (Eighty-first) Amendment Act 2000, the Constitution was amended to include Article 16(5) by which the States are permitted to carry forward the unfilled seats of the reserved category to be filled up in the succeeding years. The challenge to the constitutional validity of Article 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) was rejected by the Constitution Bench in M Nagaraj v. Union of India84 where it was held that the efficiency of administration is only relaxed and not “obliterated” by the inclusion of Articles 16(4-A) and 16(4-B).85 62. As is evident from the discussion above, the jurisprudence in the second phase on questions involving the scope of reservation, evolved around the idea that reservation dilutes the efficiency in administration or to put it otherwise, reservation is anti-merit. The Constitution was amended to overcome this Court’s holding on each of the above issues, thereby overhauling the premise that reservation does not ensure efficiency in service. The Constitution, after the numerous turbulations within each of the issues traced, today advances a more substantive reading of the equality provision, expanding the sphere and the scope of reservation to ensure that the benefits trickle down to those who need it the most. However, traces of the friction between merit and reservation continue to persist 83 [1964] 4 SCR 680 : (1964) 4 SCR 680 84 [2006] Supp. 7 SCR 336 : (2006) 8 SCC 212 85 (2006) 8 SCC 212 [108] [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1371 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. even after the amendments to Articles 16 and 335.86 This Court has, with a few divergences,87 continued to uphold the binary of merit and reservations. The understanding of the Courts at the end of this phase was that the scope of reservation must be expanded to ensure substantive equality in spite of its dilution of efficiency,88 thereby continuing to read the requirement of efficiency into Article 16(4). III. The interplay of Article 16 and Article 335 63. In this section, we will discuss whether the principle in Article 335 must be read as a limitation on the power of the State to provide reservations under Article 16.
