Mansukhbhai Kanjibhai Shah (2020) 20 SCC 360 [24] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1671 Union of India & Ors. v. Rajeev Bansal 34. Taxing statutes are interpreted by following the principles of strict interpretation.74 While interpreting a taxing statute, there is no room for any intendment.75 A taxing statute must be construed by having regard to the strict letter of the law.76 In a taxing statute, it is not possible to assume any intention or governing purpose more than what is stated in the plain language. A taxing statute can successfully impose liability on persons or property only if it frames appropriate provisions to that end. The courts cannot plugin a loophole in a taxing statute “by a strained construction in reference to the supposed intention of the Legislature.”77 Further, the considerations of equity or justice are not relevant in interpreting a taxing statute.78 35. It is a well-accepted rule of construction that in situations where the interpretation of taxing legislation is ambiguous or leads to two possible interpretations, the interpretation most beneficial to the subject of the tax should be adopted.79 It would not be an unjust result if a taxpayer escapes the tax net on account of the legislature’s failure to express itself clearly.80 36. In a taxing statute, the charging section has to be construed strictly, but the machinery provisions must be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary rules of statutory interpretation.81 The purpose is to give effect to the clear intention of the legislature. In Murarilal Mahabir Prasad v. B R Vad,82 this Court held that: “29. […] There is no equity about a tax in the sense that a provision by which a tax is imposed has to be construed strictly, regardless of the hardship that such a construction may cause either to the treasury or to the taxpayer.
