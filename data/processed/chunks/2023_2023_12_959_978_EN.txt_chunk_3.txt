The appellant had presented an invoice of Rs.1,32,66,803/- towards the cost to be incurred. The respondent on the recommendation of Dhiraj Off shore Surveyors and Adjusters Pvt. Ltd. issued a cheque for Rs. 1,00,00,000/- dated 09.06.2006 as an advance payment for replacing the engine crank shaft and other components. 4. Subsequent to the term of the fi rst policy ending, the appellant entered into a fresh Marine Hull Insurance Policy in respect of the vessel, bearing policy no. 21306557 covering the vessel for various risks including 964 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. the ‘perils of the seas’ for an insured sum of Rs. 8,26,92,000/- for the period 09.11.2006 to 08.11.2007. The American Bureau of Shipping (hereinafter for short “ABS”) conducted a survey on the vessel on 29.09.2006 and 14.10.2006 and issued Class Certifi cate dated 19.10.2006 extending the Class Certifi cate until 30.06.2009. The Class Certifi cate constitutes a representation by ABS as to the structural and mechanical fi tness of the vessel. 5. Unfortunately for the appellant, on 03.12.2006, the vessel on a voyage from Mumbai to SLQ Complex, Mumbai High South Field was struck by a Tug Boat ‘Sea Ways 9’ as a result of which the vessel sank with all cargo on board. The appellant submitted a claim amounting to Rs. 8,26,92,000/- due to the total loss of the vessel and cargo. As per the procedure, the respondent appointed M/s. J. Basheer & Associates Surveyors Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter for short “surveyor”) as the surveyors to assess the loss. The surveyor on visiting the ABS ascertained that the owners/representatives of the appellant had not informed the ABS about the previous damage to the port main engine and ABS only based on their inspection, had issued the Class certifi cate dated 19.10.2006. The surveyor’s report also states that the Country Manager of ABS also reported that if a Vessel sustains any damage to either Hull or Machinery and the same is not reported to the Class, then the Class would deem to be automatically suspended as per ABS Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels-2005 Edition, Part 1, Chapter 1, Section 2 heading ‘Suspension and Cancellation of Classifi cation’. 6. In the meanwhile, Dhiraj Off shore Surveyors and Adjusters Pvt. Ltd. submitted its fi nal report on 19.02.2007. As per their conclusion, it was considered unlikely that the vessel will be recovered and as such permanent repairs to the port main engine will not be eff ected, as were supposed to be done as a consequence of the fi rst accident. Thus, it was recommended that the sum of Rs.1,00,00,000/- paid as “on account” on the basis of their report dated 22.04.2006 be recovered. 7. In that background, since the claim of Rs. 8,26,92,000/- was not settled by the respondents, the appellant approached the NCDRC by fi ling Consumer Complaint No.166 of 2008 claiming Rs.16,62,51,467/- comprising of Rs.8,26,92,000/- towards loss of insured asset, loss of earnings of Rs.5,41,98,144/-, and interest on the insured asset @ 18% along with the cost of proceedings i.e.
