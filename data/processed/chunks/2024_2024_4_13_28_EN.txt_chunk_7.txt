2022-23. The learned ASG, relying on paragraph 14.64 of the Report of the 14th Finance Commission, contended that if the State is not able to fully utilize its sanctioned borrowings limit of 3% of GSDP in any particular year during the first four years of the award period (2015-16 to 2018-19), the State will have the option of availing 24 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports this un-utilized borrowing amount (calculated in Rupees) only in the following year within the award period. However, there is a difference between under-utilization of the borrowing limit and over-utilization of the borrowing limit. Learned ASG maintained that over-utilization is dealt with in Annexure 14.2 of Chapter-XIV in the Report of the 14th Finance Commission, which clearly prescribes as under: “Case II. Over-utilizing the borrowing amount: If a State, in a given year, borrows over and above the sanctioned borrowing limit by x amount, then in the succeeding year, the same x amount of the previous year will be deducted from the States borrowing limit of that year.” 21. According to learned ASG, the Plaintiff – State is wrong in contending that such deduction in the succeeding year can only be made within the award period of the 14th Finance Commission. He explained that over-borrowings of the previous year were adjusted for the F.Ys. 2021-22, 2022-23 and 2023-24 (as on date) to the tune of INR 9,197.15 crores, INR 13,067.78 crores and INR 4,354.72 crores respectively. According to learned ASG, the State was fully conscious of the correct position in law and had rightly acquiesced in the adjustments of the over-borrowings. Having acquiesced, it does not lie in the mouth of the Plaintiff – State to contend that once the period for the 15th Finance Commission has set in from F.Ys. 2021-22 to 2025-26, the over-borrowings of the previous years have absolutely no relevance. Learned ASG vehemently argued that the Plaintiff is wrong in contending that a reading of the report of the 14th and 15th Finance Commission indicates that for both under-utilization and over-utilization, all adjustments have to be made within the period covered by the Report of the Commission. 22. Prima facie, we are inclined to accept the argument of the Union that where there is over-utilization of the borrowing limit in the previous year, to the extent of over-borrowing, deductions are permissible in the succeeding year, even beyond the award period of the 14th Finance Commission. This is, however, a matter which will have to be finally decided in the suit. 23. At this stage, based on the contentions of the Plaintiff – State with which we are not prima facie convinced, permitting any borrowing— [2024] 4 S.C.R. 25 State of Kerala v. Union of India whether INR 24,434 crores as claimed in the written note or INR 10,722 crores as alternatively claimed—would not be tenable. 24. In fact, it has been admitted by the Plaintiff – State that there has been over-borrowing/over-utilization of the borrowing limit between the F.Ys. 2017-18 and 2019-20.
