6.6. The revenue has wrongly taken the view that the act of auction and purchase of arrack by the successful liquor contractors is inextricably intertwined and is part of one collective action. In the auction, the excise contractors are granted permits/licences for retail sale of arrack by the successful excise contractors in their allotted areas. It is thereafter that sale of arrack is affected by the excise contractors at a price fixed by the government between a minimum floor value and maximum ceiling value. Therefore, such a transaction cannot be said to be a sale or purchase through auction. 6.7. Learned counsel also submitted that the assessing officer was not conferred the jurisdiction to pass the s under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act. Jurisdiction was conferred upon the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS)-1, Bengaluru. This contention of the appellant regarding [2024] 7 S.C.R. 297 The Excise Commissioner Karnataka & Anr. v. Mysore Sales International Ltd. & Ors. jurisdiction was rejected by the learned Single Judge as being merely a technical one. 6.8. Learned counsel also submits that s dated 17.01.2001 passed by the assessing officer under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act were in breach of the principles of natural justice. No opportunity of hearing was given to the assessee. Without such hearing, the aforesaid s were passed. Such s being in violation of the principles of natural justice are void ab initio. This aspect was overlooked by the Single Bench as well as by the Division Bench of the High Court. 6.9. He therefore submits that both the s of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench are liable to be set aside. s dated 17.01.2001 passed by the assessing officer under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act for the assessment years under consideration are also liable to be set aside and quashed. The civil appeal may be allowed accordingly. 6.10. In support of his submissions, learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on the following decisions: (i) Gian Chand Ashok Kumar and Company Vs. Union of India 2; (ii) K.K. Mittal Vs. Union of India 3; (iii) State of Bihar Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax 4; (iv) M/s Naresh Kumar and Company Vs. Union of India 5; (v) Saini and Company Vs. Union of India 6; (vi) Chandigarh Distillers and Bottlers Ltd. Vs. Union of India 7; (vii) Union of India Vs. Om Parkash S.S. and Company 8. 2 (1991) 187 ITR 188 (HP) 3 (1991) 187 ITR 208 (P&H) 4 (1993) 202 ITR 535 (PAT) 5 ILR (2000) 2 P&H 6 (2000) 246 ITR 762 (HP) 7 (2002) 253 ITR 205 (P&H) 8 [2001] 1 SCR 1113 : (2001) 3 SCC 593 298 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 7. Learned senior counsel for the revenue at the outset submits that the impugned of the Division Bench of the High Court does not suffer from any error or infirmity to warrant interference. The civil appeal is misconceived and is, therefore, liable to be dismissed.
