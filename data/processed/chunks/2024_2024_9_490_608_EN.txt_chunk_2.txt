14 not applicable to the [2024] 9 S.C.R. 493 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. claim as framed – As regards applicability of Art. 18, since the payments under the contract were to be made on pro rata basis, dependent on work done and certificates issued, which were not issued, hence, the claimant was entitled to make a composite claim for the goods supplied and the work done after the project was successfully complete-when the Unit was commissioned followed by guaranteed performance because it is only then, when the outstanding amount, as per the Bills/Invoices raised, became due and payable to the claimant in terms of the contract, thus, Art. 18 would also not apply – Art. 55 was applicable since the claim was for compensation which includes a specified amount payable under a contract, in respect of the goods supplied and the work done under a contract – Claim was based on a breach of the contractual obligation as, according to the findings returned by the tribunal, the appellants failed to fulfil their obligations of making payment of the outstanding principal amount payable under the contract despite raising of bills/invoices by the claimant – Thus, the claim for the outstanding principal amount not barred by limitation. [Paras 105-107] Limitation Act, 1963 – Starting point of limitation for the claim – Date from which the limitation period is to be counted: Held: Under Art. 55, the limitation period begins to run when the contract is broken or where there are successive breaches, when the breach in respect of which the suit is instituted occurs, or where the breach is continuing, when it ceases – Claim is for the outstanding principal amount due to the claimant on discharge of his obligations under the contract – Thus, the cause of action for the claim is appellants’ failure to make payment of the outstanding principal amount to the claimant despite discharge of contractual obligations by it – Nothing brought to the notice that there was any fixed date, or period of credit, for payment of the balance amount – Starting point of limitation should be the date when the claimant had fulfilled all its obligations under the contract and was entitled for release of the outstanding amount payable under the contract – Tribunal concluded that commissioning took place in the month of May 2015; technical issues were resolved by 21 September 2015; and performance guarantee period expired on 19 March 2016 – Final payment of the principal outstanding amount was dependent on meeting the requirement of performance guarantee, the cause of action for the claim, as made, matured on 494 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports expiry of that stipulated period of 180 days within which, despite request, the appellants failed to undertake the performance guarantee test – Thus, even though there might be several bills/ invoices raised/issued by the claimant during execution of the contract, the claim of the claimant for the outstanding principal amount matured on expiry of 180 days from the date of the notice given by the claimant to the appellants to undertake the performance guarantee test – Thus, limitation for the claim started to run from 19 March 2016.
