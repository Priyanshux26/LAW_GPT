This is a classic case of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. In view of the Constitution Bench of this court in Shilpa Sailesh v. Varun Sreenivasan, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 544 which has held that in such cases where there is irretrievable breakdown of marriage then dissolution of marriage is the only solution and this Court can grant a decree of divorce in exercise of its power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. 11. We therefore declare the marriage to have broken down irretrievably and therefore in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India we are of the considered opinion that this being a case of irretrievable breakdown of marriage must now be dissolved by grant of decree of divorce.” 19. In light of the facts and circumstances of the present case, along with powers conferred under Article 142 of the Constitution of India and judicial precedents discussed herein, we hereby grant the decree of divorce on account of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. As both the parties are professionally qualified medical doctors and [2024] 7 S.C.R. 941 Vikas Kanaujia v. Sarita have sufficient and equal earnings, we are not inclined to award any permanent alimony. 20. The judgement dated 22.08.2019 passed by the High Court of Allahabad is hereby set aside. The marriage between the parties is dissolved, exercising powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. The present appeal is accordingly allowed. 21. Pending application(s), if any, is/are disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Gaurav Upadhyay, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Kanu Agrawal, Adv.)
