It may not be out of place to state at this stage that respondent no. 2 was not made a party to the aforesaid arbitration proceedings. In the course of the said proceedings, the petitioner filed an application under Section 16 of the Act, 1996 before the arbitral tribunal, contending that the four agreements entered into between the parties were part of a composite transaction and for this reason the agreements should be made a part of a singular proceeding.

During the pendency of the aforesaid application, on 22.10.2019, the NCLT, Mumbai admitted an application filed under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (for short “the Insolvency Code”) against the petitioner and appointed an Interim Resolution Professional. Vide Public Announcement dated 25.10.2019, the Interim Resolution Professional ed for the commencement of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (‘CIRP’). On 05.11.2019, the NCLT passed an adjourning the arbitration proceedings sine die due to initiation of the CIRP. 17. Meanwhile, upon seeking permission of the Interim Resolution Professional, the petitioner sent a fresh notice to the respondents on 07.11.2019 invoking arbitration under Clause 15.7 of the GTC agreement. Pertinently, the petitioner arrayed respondent no. 2 in the said arbitration notice. The petitioner appointed Dr. Justice Arijit Pasayat, former Judge of this Court, as its nominated arbitrator and called upon the respondents to appoint their arbitrator for the constitution of the tribunal.

This petition was heard by a three-Judge Bench of this Court. By an dated 06.05.2022, Chief Justice N.V Ramana (as he then was) speaking for himself and Justice A.S. Bopanna doubted the correctness of the application of the Group of Companies doctrine by the Indian courts. Chief Justice Ramana criticised the approach of a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Chloro Controls India (P) Ltd v. Severn Trent Water Purification Inc reported in (2013) 1 SCC 641 which relied upon the phrase “claiming through or under” appearing in Section 45 of the Act, 1996 to adopt the Group of Companies doctrine. He noted that the subsequent decisions of this Court read the doctrine into Sections 8 and 35 of the Act, 1996 without adequately examining the interpretation of the phrase “claiming through or under” appearing in those provisions. He also observed that economic concepts such as tight group structure and single economic unit alone cannot be utilized to bind a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement in the absence of an express consent. Consequently, he referred the matter to the larger bench to seek clarity on the interpretation of the phrase “claiming through or under” 206 [2024] 9 S.C.R.
