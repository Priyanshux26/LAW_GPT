By virtue of the said provision, a disciplinary proceeding initiated by means of a chargesheet prior to the retirement of a bank employee would continue even after his retirement in view of the provision contained in Regulation 20(3)(iii). In the facts of that case, the Bench noted that disciplinary proceeding was initiated by submission of chargesheet after the retirement of the respondent. Therefore, while confirming the decision of the High Court, this Court dismissed the appeal filed by Canara Bank. 22. In the case of M.B. Motwani (supra), Supreme Court once again reiterated the position that a departmental proceeding is not initiated merely on issuance of a show cause notice. It is initiated only when a chargesheet is issued because that is the date of application of mind on the allegations levelled against an employee by the competent authority. In that case, it was noticed that the deceased employee had attained the age of superannuation on 31.07.1991 whereas the chargesheet was issued to him on 07.12.1991 meaning thereby that on the date of his superannuation, no disciplinary proceeding was pending against him. That being the position, this Court dismissed the appeal filed by UCO Bank. 23. Having surveyed the relevant legal provisions and the case law, let us now revert back to the essential undisputed facts of the case. Respondent was appointed in the SBI as a clerk typist on 08.06.1973. In due course of time, he rose through the ranks and reached managerial position. On completion of 30 years of service, he was due to superannuate on 26.12.2003. Exercising powers under Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules, respondent was granted 5 [2007] 5 SCR 233 : (2007) 9 SCC 625 6 (2016) 12 SCC 724 816 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports extension of service vide dated 05.08.2023 from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. On 18.08.2009, a notice was issued to the petitioner wherein and whereby serious irregularities allegedly committed by him were highlighted and his response was sought for. On 21.08.2009, respondent was placed under suspension. Though respondent had submitted his reply to the notice dated 18.08.2009 on 27.10.2009, it appears that the disciplinary authority did not accept such reply and decided to initiate disciplinary proceeding against the respondent by issuing show cause notice dated 18.03.2011 under Rule 68(1) of the Service Rules. Alongwith the show cause notice, articles of charges and the statement of allegations on the basis of which the charges were framed, were sent to the respondent. There is nothing on record to show further continuance of service by the respondent beyond 01.10.2010. As noted above, service of the respondent was extended from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. 24. From the above, it is evident that charge memo was issued to the respondent on 18.03.2011 after his extension of service was over on 01.10.2010. This is an undisputed jurisdictional fact. 25. Appellants have contended that respondent was paid subsistence allowance from his date of suspension i.e. 21.08.2009 till his dismissal from service vide dated 07.03.2012 beyond 01.10.2010. Besides it was the case of the respondent himself before the enquiry officer, disciplinary authority as well as before the appellate authority that he was due to superannuate on 30.10.2012.
