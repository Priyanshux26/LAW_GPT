[Para 17.1 F & 17.2][1093-C-G] 1.11. Viewed from any angle, even on direct construction of the relevant clauses vis-à-vis the subject-matter of the present petition, it remains beyond a shadow of doubt that the policy in question with its amendment is of no application whatsoever in G relation to the project in question.
