14. This Court in VVS Rama Sharma (supra) has answered this question in the affirmative and has held that under Entry 44 of List III, “the power to levy stamp duty on all documents, is concurrent. But the power to prescribe the rate of such levy is excluded from Entry 44 of List III and is divided between Parliament and the State Legislatures.”24 Therefore, the charging provision for imposition of stamp duty, even on documents contained in Entry 91 of List I, can be enacted by both the Parliament and the state legislatures, subject to the provisions of Article 254.25 These principles have been summarised in VVS Rama Sharma (supra) as follows: “23. As mentioned earlier, under Entry 44 of List III, the power to levy stamp duty on all documents is concurrent. But the power to prescribe the rate of such levy is excluded from Entry 44 of List III and is divided between Parliament and the State Legislatures. If the instrument falls under the categories mentioned in Entry 91 of List I, the power to prescribe the rate will belong to Parliament, and for all other instruments or documents, the power to prescribe the rate belongs to the State Legislature under Entry 63 of List II. Therefore, the meaning of Entry 44 of List III is that excluding the power to prescribe the rate, the charging provisions of a law relating to stamp duty can be made both by the Union and the State Legislature, in the concurrent sphere, subject to Article 254 in case of repugnancy. So, in the case at hand, it is Entry 91 of List I of the Seventh Schedule which would be applicable and the States do not have the power to circumvent a Central law.” 15. In a recent in Vijay v. Union of India,26 this Court has again held that the power to levy stamp duty on all documents is concurrent under Entry 44 of List III. Only the power to prescribe the rate of such duty is with the Parliament, and subject to Entry 91 of List I, with the state legislatures.27 24 ibid, para 14 25 ibid, para 15 26 [2023] 15 SCR 293 : 2023 SCC Online SC 1585, 2023 INSC 1030 27 ibid, para 12 258 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 16. From the above precedents, it is clear that the state of Rajasthan has the power to impose and collect stamp duty on insurance policies under Entry 44 of List III, albeit such duty must be imposed as per the rate prescribed by a Parliamentary legislation under Entry 91 of List I. 17. In view of the above explanation, the issue relating to legislative competence raised by the learned ASG conclusively ends. However, the learned ASG has raised additional arguments regarding the requirements of a valid tax law and on whether Entry 44 of List III is a taxation entry. Although we find these submissions to be unnecessary, we will deal with them as they have been raised.
