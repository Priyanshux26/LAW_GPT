FACTUAL ASPECTS 2. The deceased was employed in a company as an Associate. The deceased was required to attend the night shift between 11:00 pm and 09:00 am. On 1st November 2007, one Purushottam Dasrath Borate (Convict no.2) was scheduled to pick up the deceased from her residence at 10:30 pm. Convict no.2 was the driver of the cab hired by the employer of the deceased. As per usual practice, Convict no.2 gave a missed call to the deceased. After receiving the missed call, the deceased came down. After picking up the deceased, Convict no.2 was supposed to pick up one Sagar Bidkar, an employee of the same company. Though Sagar repeatedly called Convict no.2, there was no response. At about 12:45 am, Convict no.2 came to pick up Sagar. When Sagar sat in the vehicle, one Pradeep Yashwant Kokade (Convict no.1/Respondent no.1) was already occupying the car’s rear seat. Convict no.1 introduced convict no.2 to Sagar as his friend. Before the vehicle reached the company’s office, Convict no.1 alighted from the car. Convict no.2 requested Sagar to endorse in the company’s record that the delay was due to the puncture of a tyre in the vehicle. 3.
