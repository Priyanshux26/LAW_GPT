D 256. The appellant has submitted that Ahmedabad Electricity Company,97 the predecessor of the appellant, notified the Conditions of Supply on 14 October 1994, and that would be applicable. For the period from 10 June 2003 till 31 March 2005, when the Electricity Supply Code came into force, the 1994 Conditions of Supply continued to operate in E terms of Section 185(2)(a) of the 2003 Act. Condition 2 of the 1994 Conditions of Supply provided that a requisition for supply of electrical energy shall be made in accordance with the requisition form attached at Annexure A of the said conditions and shall be signed by the owner or occupier of the premises for which supply is required. Annexure A of the said conditions provides a form of requisition for supply of energy. F The requisition form is not only limited to a new connection, but also extends to reconnection, extension of load, tapping connection, and name change. The form also requires the applicant to pay all the dues of energy bills and other charges up to the date of transfer. The relevant undertaking is extracted below: G “I/We hereby give consent to transfer above mentioned service in the name of the applicant and I/We abide to pay all the dues of energy bills & other charges upto the date of transfer.” H 97 “AEC” K. C. NINAN v. KERALA STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD & 755 ORS. [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 257. A perusal of Annexure A makes it evident that the above A extracted undertaking is actually the undertaking of a ‘current consumer’ giving consent to transfer the service connection and undertaking to pay all past dues. This is not an undertaking of an applicant, which has been separately provided for in the same form. Therefore, Annexure A makes a clear distinction between a ‘current consumer’ and an applicant for B electricity connection. Since the respondent purchased the said property through an auction-purchase, there was no ‘current consumer’ to give any consent. Therefore, the undertaking under Form A will not be applicable qua the respondent. Hence, we find no reason to interfere with the findings of the High Court. The appeal shall stand dismissed. C Item 101.4: Dakshin Gujarat Vij Co. v. Apurva Chemicals, SLP (C) No. 37871 of 2012 and 101.17: Paschim Gujarat Vij Company v. Apurva Chemicals, SLP (C) No. 18280 of 2013 258. A power connection was issued in favour of Arunesh Processors Pvt Ltd, the previous owner. Due to non-payment of energy D bills, the agreement with the power supply company was terminated with effect from 01 February 1995. In 1995, the appellant filed a suit for recovery of Rs. 3.41 lakhs against the previous owner before the Civil Judge, Sr. Division, Valsad.

Arunesh Processors Pvt Ltd was wound up in 2002 and its assets were E auctioned by the Bombay High Court on an “as is where is basis”.
