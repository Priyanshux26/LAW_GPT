Paragraph 47.3 reads thus: “47.3. Constitutional courts, in the ordinary course, should refrain from fixing a time-bound schedule for the disposal of cases pending before any other courts. Constitutional courts may issue directions for the time-bound disposal of cases only in exceptional circumstances. The issue of prioritising the disposal of cases should be best left to the decision of the courts concerned where the cases are pending;” (underline supplied) 8. A direction which can be issued in exceptional circumstances is being routinely issued by High Courts without noticing the law laid down by the Constitution Bench. 9. The Appeal is, accordingly, allowed. 10. Registry to forward soft copies of this to Registrar Generals of all the High Courts with a request to them to circulate copies to all the Hon’ble Judges of the High Court.
