As such, no interference would be warranted with regard to the said issue also. [Para 38][662-F-G] 1.5 The only issue that is required to be considered is as to whether deallocation of Lohara Coal Blocks would amount to E ‘Change in Law’ and as to whether APML would be entitled to restitution on account of the same. The same is concurrently held in favour of APML by both the MERC and the APTEL, thereby declaring the event of deallocation of Lohara Coal Blocks as ‘Change in Law’. Unless the said issue is found to be perverse or in ignorance of the mandatory statutory provisions or is based F on extraneous considerations, it will not be permissible for this Court to interfere with the same. A perusal of the definition of ‘Law’ as found in Article 1.1 of the PPA would reveal that any or notification, rule or regulation by an Indian Governmental Instrumentality would constitute ‘Law’. It cannot be disputed that Government of Maharashtra, Government of India and various G statutory authorities would fall under the term ‘Governmental Instrumentalities’. In the present case, the cutoff date under the PPA was 14th August 2008. It is to be noted that the power to notify a Tiger Reserve as a Buffer Zone is vested with the State H 650 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A Government under Section 38V of the Wildlife (Protection) Act. For consideration and creation of Buffer Zone, three statutory requirements have to be complied with. From the material placed on record, it is clear that prior to 14th August 2008, the area where Lohara Coal Block is situated was not even proposed to be notified as a Buffer Zone. It is only seven days after the cut-off B date, i.e., 21st February 2008, that the Chief Conservator, Forests gave approval for constitution of an Expert Committee for creating the Buffer Zone surrounding the core area. Thereafter, on 7th March 2008, the Conservator, TATR submitted the proposed demarcation to the Chief Conservator of Forest for creating the C Buffer Zone surrounding the core area of TATR. The consultation of the Gram Sabha happened only between May 2008 and November 2008, i.e., much after the cut-off date. Subsequently, on 8th October 2008, the Conservator, TATR submitted the revised proposal for Buffer Zone to TATR. After numerous other deliberations, including the one with National Tiger Conservation D Authority (NTCA), the Government of Maharashtra issued a notification on 5th May 2010 notifying 1101.7711 sq. km. as the Buffer Zone of TATR. As such, the notification dated 5th May 2010, which included the area where Lohara Coal Blocks were situated, will have to be construed to be a ‘Change in Law’. It is E only because of issuance of the said notification, the coal block, which would have otherwise been available to APML, was not available to it. [Paras 40, 42-45][663-A-B; C-H; 664-A-F] 1.6 MoC had allocated Lohara Coal Blocks vide allocation letter dated 6th November 2007 and MoEF granted the ToR for F Lohara Coal Blocks on 16th May 2008 pursuant to EAC’s recommendation in the meeting dated 28th April 2008.
