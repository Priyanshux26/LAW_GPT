[2024] 7 S.C.R. 1124 : 2024 INSC 579 Kishorchandra Chhanganlal Rathod v. Union of India & Ors. (Civil Appeal No. 7930 of 2024) 23 July 2024 [Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether exercise of statutory powers under the Delimitation Act, 2002 are insusceptible to powers of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Headnotes† Constitutional law – Limitations on judicial scrutiny on electoral matters under Article 329 of the Constitution of India and scope of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India over exercise of power under the Delimitation Act: Held: Although Article 329 of the Constitution of India undeniably restricts the scope of judicial scrutiny regarding the validity of any law relating to delimitation of constituencies or allotment of seats to such constituencies, it cannot be construed to have been imposed for every action of delimitation exercise – If judicial intervention is deemed completely barred, citizens would not have any forum to plead their grievances, leaving them solely at the mercy of the Delimitation Commission – As a constitutional court and guardian of public interest, permitting such a scenario would be contrary to the Court’s duties and principle of separation of powers – Reliance placed on the of this Hon’ble Court in Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (Dmk) v. Secretary Governors Secretariat and Ors. [2019] 14 SCR 704 : (2020) 6 SCC 548 : 2019 INSC 1326 and State of Goa v. Fouziya Imtiaz Shaikh [2021] 2 SCR 770 : (2021) 8 SCC 401 : 2021 INSC 179, where this Hon’ble Court held that a Constitutional Court can intervene for facilitation of elections, or where a case of malafide or arbitrary exercise of power is made out. [Paras 5 and 6] Constitutional Law – Nothing precludes a Constitutional Court from deciding validity of s passed by Delimitation Commission: [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1125 Kishorchandra Chhanganlal Rathod v. Union of India & Ors. Held: While Courts shall always be guided by settled principles of scope, ambit and limitation on the exercise of judicial review in delimitation matters, there is nothing that precludes them to check the validity of s passed by Delimitation Commission on the touchstone of the Constitution – If the is found to be manifestly arbitrary and irreconcilable to the constitutional values, the Court can grant the appropriate remedy to rectify the situation – A Constitutional Court can undertake the exercise of judicial review within the limited sphere at an appropriate stage.
