The NCLAT held that even according to the version of the appellants, the period of 30 days would end on 4 October 2022 while the appeal was filed on 10 October 2022. It noted that 10 days (from 26 August 2022 to 4 September 2022) were spent prior to the application for a certified copy and between 15 September 2022 and 4 October 2022 another period of 20 days elapsed. E 7. The NCLAT concluded that the appeal was barred by limitation on the ground that it was instituted on the 46th day following the of the NCLT, exceeding the outer limit of 45 days that was permissible under Section 61 of the IBC. 8. The appellant questions the of the NCLAT on limitation. F 9. The following submissions have been urged by Mr Bhanu Gupta, counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant: i. The NCLAT ought to have excluded the period from 5 September 2022, when an application for obtaining a certified G copy was filed till 15 September 2022, when the certified copy was received, while computing the period of limitation; ii. The NCLAT has erroneously taken the entire period between 26 August 2022 and 10 October 2022 by failing to exclude the date on which the was pronounced, H 1166 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A namely, 26 August 2022 in terms of Section 12(2) of the Limitation Act 1963 and Rule 3 of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal Rules 20165; iii. The NCLAT has disregarded judicial precedents including the of this Court in V Nagarajan v. SKS Ispat B and Power Limited & Ors6; and iv. Since the of the NCLT was uploaded on the website on 15 September 2022 on which day the certified copy was also made available, it was impossible for the appellant to draft an appeal prior to 15 September 2022 based merely C on the pronouncement of the without knowledge of the grounds for dismissal. 10. On the other hand, Ms Rashi Bansal, counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent urged that: i. The appeal was filed on 10 October 2022 in the electronic D mode; ii.
