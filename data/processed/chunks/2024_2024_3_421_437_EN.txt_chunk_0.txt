Ravikumar* and Sanjay Kumar, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether there could be any bar on the Trial Court for proceeding u/s. 82 Cr.P.C., merely because an anticipatory application for bail has been filed or because such an application was adjourned without passing any interim . Headnotes Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.438 and s.82 – Application for anticipatory bail was filed in November 2022 and brought up for hearing on 04.04.2023, on which it was dismissed – Meanwhile, proclamation was issued u/s. 82 Cr.P.C. on 04.01.2023 and thereafter process u/s.83 Cr.P.C. was initiated on 15.03.2023 – The core contention of the appellants is that the rejection of the application for anticipatory bail without considering the application on merits for the reason of issuance of proclamation u/s. 82, Cr.P.C., is unsustainable – Propriety: Held: In view of the proviso u/s. 438(1), Cr.PC, it cannot be contended that if, at the stage of taking up the matter for consideration, the Court is not rejecting the application, it is bound to pass an interim for the grant of anticipatory bail – In short, nothing prevents the court from adjourning such an application without passing an interim – The appellants cannot be heard to contend that the application for anticipatory bail filed in November, 2022 could not have been adjourned without passing interim – At any rate, the said application was rejected on 04.04.2023 –Pending the application for anticipatory bail, in the absence of an interim protection, if a police officer can arrest the accused concerned how can it be contented that the court which issued summons on account of non-obedience to comply with its for appearance and then issuing warrant of arrest cannot proceed further in terms of the provisions u/s. 82, Cr.PC, merely because of the pendency of an application for anticipatory bail – * Author 422 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
