274 Perry v. Thomas, 482 US 483 (1987); Doctor’s Associates Inc v. Casarotto, 517 US 681 (1996). 275 Section 2-302, Uniform Commercial Code. [It reads: If the court as a matter of law finds the contractor or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result. When it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making the determination.”] 276 Hume v.

US courts have consistently held that an arbitration agreement which provides for the unilateral formation of a panel of arbitrators by one of the parties is inherently inequitable and unconscionable.281 The reason is that a unilateral arbitrator selection clause is inimical to the principle of arbitration, that is, the resolution of disputes through a fair and impartial tribunal. It has been held that an arbitration agreement that allows one of the parties to unilaterally control the arbitral tribunal conflicts with the “fundamental notions of fairness”282 and does not meet the “minimum levels of integrity which we must demand of a contractually structured substitute for judicial proceedings.”283 The US courts have emphasised the importance of equality in the appointment process as a means to secure fairness in the arbitration proceedings.284 153. In Hooters of Am. Inc. v. Phillips,285 the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had to determine the validity of an arbitration agreement for employment-related disputes. The arbitration agreement provided for the formation of a three-member arbitral tribunal. The employer and employee select their arbitrators, who in turn select the third arbitrator. However, the employee’s arbitrator and the third arbitrator were selected from a list of arbitrators created exclusively by the employer. The Court observed that the arbitration agreement gave Hooters “control over the entire panel and places no limits whatsoever on whom Hooters can put on the list.” It was further observed: “Under the rules, Hooters is free to devise lists of partial arbitrators who have existing relationships, financial or familial, with Hooters and its management.
