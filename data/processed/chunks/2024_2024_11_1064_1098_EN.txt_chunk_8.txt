In this background there could not have been any justification for the dispensation of few weeks’ time to the landowners to file objections under Section 5-A of the Act, on the ground of urgency. On this aspect, reliance was placed upon Radhy Shyam (dead) through LRs. and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others,15 wherein this Court observed as follows: - “82. In this case, the Development Authority sent the proposal sometime in 2006. The authorities up to the level of the Commissioner completed the exercise of 15 [2011] 8 SCR 359 : (2011) 5 SCC 553; hereinafter referred to as ‘Radhy Shyam’ [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1077 Kali Charan and Others v. State of U.P. and Others survey and preparation of documents by the end of December 2006 but it took one year and almost three months for the State Government to issue notification under Section 4 read with Sections 17(1) and 17(4). If this much time was consumed between the receipt of proposal for the acquisition of land and issue of notification, it is not possible to accept the argument that four to five weeks within which the objections could be filed under sub-section (1) of Section 5-A and the time spent by the Collector in making enquiry under sub-section (2) of Section 5-A would have defeated the object of the acquisition.” Reliance in this regard was also placed on Dev Sharan and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others,16 wherein this Court observed as below: - “37[Ed. : Para 37 corrected vide Official Corrigendum No. F.3/Ed.B.J./16/2011 dated 16-3-2011.]. Thus the time which elapsed between publication of Section 4(1) and Section 17 notifications, and Section 6 declaration in the local newspapers is 11 months and 23 days i.e. almost one year. This slow pace at which the government machinery had functioned in processing the acquisition, clearly evinces that there was no urgency for acquiring the land so as to warrant invoking Section 17(4) of the Act. 38. In Para 15 of the writ petition, it has been clearly stated that there was a time gap of more than 11 months between Section 4 and Section 6 notifications, which demonstrates that there was no urgency in the State action which could deny the petitioners their right under Section 5-A. In the counter which was filed in this case by the State before the High Court, it was not disputed that the time gap between Section 4 notification read with Section 17, and Section 6 notification was about 11 months.” 16 [2011] 3 SCR 728 : (2011) 4 SCC 769 1078 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Learned counsel for the appellants also placed reliance on Devender Kumar Tyagi and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others,17 wherein, this Court, while dealing with a post-notification delay of almost two years, held as follows: “28. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, it is clear that this Court, vide its dated 17-8-2004 [(2011) 12 SCC 572], has issued a direction to the respondents to relocate the bone mills and allied industries causing environment pollution and health hazards as per the recommendations of CPCB and, inter alia, the respondents were also directed to identify the area for relocation.
