(3) All the persons so summoned shall be bound to attend in person or through authorised agents, as such officer may direct, and shall be bound to state the truth upon any subject respecting which they are examined or make statements, and produce such documents as may be required. (4) Every proceeding under sub-sections (2) and (3) shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). (5) Subject to any rules made in this behalf by the Central Government, any officer referred to in sub-section (2) may impound and retain in his custody for such period, as he thinks fit, any records produced before him in any proceedings under this Act: Provided that an Assistant Director or a Deputy Director shall not-- (a) impound any records without recording his reasons for so doing; or (b) retain in his custody any such records for a period exceeding three months, without obtaining the previous approval of the Joint Director.” 978 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Section 50 (1)(b) speaks of enforcing the attendance of any person, Section 50 (2) speaks of the authorized officials having the power to summon any person whose attendance they consider necessary whether to give evidence or to produce any records during the course of any investigation or proceeding under the Act. Section 50 (3) states that all persons so summoned shall be bound to attend in person or through authorized agents, as such officer may direct, and shall be bound to state the truth upon any subject respecting which they are examined or make statements, and produce such documents and Section 50(4) states that every proceeding under sub-Sections (2) and (3) shall be deemed to be in judicial proceeding. A person in judicial custody being not a free person cannot be summoned and any statement to be recorded will be after obtaining the permission of the Court which has remanded him to the judicial custody in the other case. 34. In view of the above and keeping the salutary principle of Article 21 in mind, we hold that since the words ‘procedure established by law’ occurring in Article 21 has to be a reasonable and valid procedure, the statement of the appellant under Section 50 cannot be relied upon against the appellant in ECIR No. 5 of 2023 even though the appellant was at that point in custody in ECIR No. 4 of 2022. Statement of Afshar Ali - Co-accused 35. The appellant was not named in FIR No. 399 of 2023. It appears from the complaint of the respondent-Enforcement Directorate at para 6 that Afshar Ali, Saddam Hussain, Imtiaz Ahmad were arrested on 14.04.2023 in ECIR/RNZO/18/2022 though in the summary of the statements at para 8.12 it is mentioned that Afshar Ali was arrested on 14.04.2023 read with prayer (c) of the complaint it appears that the arrest that is referred to in para 8.12 is the arrest in ECIR/ RNZO/18/2022.
