The plaintiffs’ failure to fulfil essential contractual terms, coupled with the lack of authority to bind all co-owners, renders the grant of specific performance inappropriate. The equitable remedy sought 962 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports by the plaintiffs cannot be granted in light of their conduct and the circumstances of the case. 24. In view of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate their continuous readiness and willingness to perform their contractual obligations, and that Defendant No. 1 lacked the authority to bind Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 in the agreement dated 06.06.1993. Given the incomplete and unenforceable nature of the agreement, we find it neither just nor equitable to grant the relief sought by the plaintiffs. 25. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The and decree dated 25.10.2013 passed by the High Court of Orissa are set aside. The dated 17.05.1997 passed by the Trial Court dismissing the suit for specific performance is restored. Furthermore, the appellants are directed to refund to the plaintiffs (Respondent Nos. 1 & 2) a sum of ₹10,00,000 (Rupees Ten Lakhs) within a period of two months from the date of this . This amount includes the earnest money paid by the plaintiffs and accounts for any interest and expenses incurred. 26. There shall be no as to costs. Result of the Case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
