Scheme cannot be tested on the parameters applicable to economic policy — Matters of economic policy normally pertain to trade, business and commerce, whereas contributions to political parties relate to the democratic polity, citizens’ right to know and accountability in the democracy — Primary objective of the Scheme, and relevant amendments, is electoral reform and not economic reform — To give the legislation the latitude of economic policy, it would be diluting the principle of free and fair elections. [Para 15] Elections — Electoral process — Presumption of constitutionality — Application, to electoral laws: Held: (per Dr Dnananjaya ४ Chandrachud, Cul, (for himself and for B R Gavai, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, JJ): Presumption of constitutionality is based on democratic accountability, that is, the legislators are elected representatives who are aware of the needs of the citizens and are best placed to frame policies to resolve them; and that they are privy to information necessary for policy making which the Courts as an adjudicating authority are not — However, the policy underlying the legislation must not violate the freedoms and rights entrenched in Part III of the Constitution and other constitutional provisions — Presumption of constitutionality is rebutted when a prima facie case of violation of a fundamental right is established - Onus then shifts on the State to prove that the violation of the fundamental right is justified — It cannot be said that the presumption of constitutionality does not apply to laws which deal with electoral process [Paras 44, 45] — Held: (per Sanjiv Khanna, J. ): Doctrine of presumption of constitutionality has its limitations when the test of proportionality is applied — Structured proportionality places an obligation on the State at a higher level, as it is a polycentric examination, both empirical and normative — While the courts do not pass a value on contested questions of policy, and give weight and deference to the government decision by acknowledging the legislature’s expertise to determine complex factual issues, the proportionality test is not based on preconceived notion or presumption — Standard of proof is a civil standard or a balance of probabilities; where scientific or social science evidence is [2024] 2 S.C.R. 425 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. available, it is examined; and where evidence is inconclusive or does not exist and cannot be developed, reason and logic may suffice. [Para 18] Elections — Electoral process — Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018 — Corporate donations to national parties through electoral bonds — Annual audit reports of political parties from 2017- 18 to 2022-23 as available on website of ECI - Significance — Doctrine of proportionality, application: Held: (Per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) Data indicative of the quantum of corporate funding through the anonymous Bonds -— It clarifies that majority of contribution through Bonds has gone to political parties which are ruling parties in the Centre and the States — More than 50% of the Electoral Bonds in number, and 94% of the Electoral Bonds in value terms were for Rs.1 crore — This supports the reasoning and conclusion on the application of the doctrine of proportionality - Based on the analysis of the data available, the Scheme fails to meet the balancing prong of the proportionality test, however, the proportionality stricto sensu not applied due to the limited availability of data and evidence.
