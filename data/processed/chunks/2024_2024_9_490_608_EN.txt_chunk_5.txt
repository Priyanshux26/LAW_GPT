[Paras 139, 141] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – ss. 34, 37 – Arbitral award – Setting aside of – Plea that the arbitral tribunal adopted different yardstick for adjudicating the claim than what was adopted for the counterclaim; and the reasoning is completely flawed and perverse : Held: Distinction would have to be drawn between an arbitral award where reasons are either lacking/unintelligible or perverse and an arbitral award where reasons are there but appear inadequate or insufficient – In a case where reasons appear insufficient or inadequate, if, on a careful reading of the entire award, coupled with documents recited/relied therein, the underlying reason, factual or legal, that forms the basis of the award, is discernible/intelligible, and the same exhibits no perversity, the court need not set aside the award while exercising powers u/s. 34 or s. 37, rather it may explain the existence of that underlying reason while dealing with a challenge laid to the award – In doing so, the court does not supplant the reasons of the arbitral tribunal but only explains it for a better and clearer understanding of the award – On facts, the arbitral tribunal did not adopt different yardstick for adjudicating the claim than what was adopted for the counterclaim and the reasoning of the arbitral tribunal is not flawed or perverse – Though reasons recorded in the award at first blush appear insufficient, or a bit confusing, but, when those reasons are examined in the context of the documents placed and the arguments advanced, the underlying reasons, which form basis of the conclusion, are not only intelligible but sound – Mistake, if any, committed by 498 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the arbitral tribunal in using the words ‘ongoing negotiations’ in place of acknowledgement is trivial does not go to the root of the matter as to have a material bearing on the conclusion – Thus, for this mistake alone, the award is not liable to be set aside – Furthermore, it cannot be said that the arbitral tribunal was obliged to accept the admission contained in the minutes of meeting qua liquidated damages and customs duties, because it relied on it for extending the limitation – Tribunal was well within its jurisdiction in drawing a conclusion that the claimant was not liable in respect of those items which formed part of the counterclaim, based on consideration of the entire evidence, at variance with the recitals in the acknowledgement – Such conclusion is a plausible view and cannot be termed perverse – Single Judge of the High Court erred in law while interfering with the arbitral award – Furthermore, as regards the plea that the appellate court-Division Bench of the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction while providing its own reasons to support the conclusion in the award, the appellate court took pains, and rightly so, to understand and explain the underlying reason on which the claim of the respondent was found within limitation – Appellate court was well within its jurisdiction to explain the underlying legal principle which the arbitral tribunal had applied; and in doing so, it did not supplant the reasons provided in the award – Impugned of the Division Bench does not suffer from any legal infirmity.
