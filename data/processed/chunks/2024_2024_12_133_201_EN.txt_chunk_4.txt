139 M/s HPCL Bio-Fuels Ltd. v. M/s Shahaji Bhanudas Bhad appointment of a new management, whereas the objective behind the appointment of an arbitrator is to resolve the disputes arising between the parties out of a private contract – As soon as the CIRP of a corporate debtor is initiated, it becomes a proceeding in rem – On the contrary, arbitration being concerned with private disputes is not an in-rem proceeding. [Para 98] Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Distinguishing feature that sets apart ordinary recovery proceedings from insolvency proceedings: Held: Insolvency proceedings are fundamentally different from proceedings for recovery of debt such as a suit for recovery of money, execution of decree or claims for amount due under arbitration, etc. – The first distinguishing feature that sets apart ordinary recovery proceedings from insolvency proceedings is that under the former the primary relief is the recovery of dues whereas under the latter the primary concern is the revival and rehabilitation of the corporate debtor – No doubt both proceedings contemplate an aspect of recovery of debt, however in insolvency proceedings, the recovery is only a consequence of the rehabilitation/ resolution of the corporate debtor and not the main relief – The second distinguishing feature is that although both proceedings entail recovery of debt to a certain extent, however they are different inasmuch as when it comes to recovery proceedings it is the individual creditor’s debt which is sought to be recovered, whereas in insolvency proceedings it is the entire debt of the company which is sought to be resolved – The former is only for the benefit of the individual creditor who initiates the recovery proceedings whereas the latter is for the benefit of all creditors irrespective of who initiates insolvency – The last distinguishing feature is that, a recovery proceeding be it a suit or arbitration is initiated by a creditor where an amount is due and is unpaid by a debtor, in other words the intention behind initiating a recovery proceeding is simpliciter for the full recovery of amount which is unpaid to it – Whereas, the underlying intention behind initiating insolvency is not with the intention of recovering the amount owed to it, but rather with the intention that the corporate debtor is resolved / rehabilitated through a new management as soon as possible before it becomes unviable with no prospect of any meaningful recovery of its dues in the near future.
