used for construing the Section. LORD MACNAGHTEN emphatically stated: “It is well-settled that marginal notes to the sections of an Act of Parliament cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing the Act. The contrary opinion originated in a mistake, and has been exploded long ago. There seems to be no reason for giving the marginal notes in an Indian statute any greater authority than the marginal notes in an English Act of Parliament”.240 PATANJALI SHASTRI, J., after referring to the above case with approval observed: “Marginal notes in an Indian statute, as in an Act of Parliament, cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing the statute.”241 At any rate, there can be no justifi cation for restricting the section by the marginal note,242 and the marginal note cannot certainly control the meaning of the body of the section if the language employed therein is clear.243” 304. Justice G P Singh however notes that : “Some Indian cases also show that reference to marginal notes may be permissible in exceptional cases for construing a section in a statute.” 305. In Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. State of Bihar244, Chief Justice S R Das, speaking for a seven-Judge Bench dealt with the interpretation of Article 286 of the Constitution which forms a part of Part XXI of the Constitution dealing with “Finance, Property, Contracts and Suits”. The Court noted that Article 286 with several Articles is grouped 240 Balraj Kunwar v. Jagatpal Singh, ILR 26 All 392, p. 406 : 31 IA 132: 1 All LJ 384 (PC) 241 C.I.T. v. Ahmedbhai Umarbhai & Co., AIR 1950 SC 134, p. 141 : 1950 SCR 335; Board of Muslim Waqfs, Rajasthan v. Radhakishan, AIR 1979 SC 289, pp. 295, 296 : (1979) 2 SCC 468; Kalawati Bai v. Soiryabai, AIR 1991 SC 1581, p. 1586 : (1991) 3 SCC 410; Guntaiah v. Hambamma, (2005) 6 SCC 228, pp. 233, 234 (para 11) : AIR 2005 SC 4013. But see Uttam Das Chela Sunderdas v. Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, 1996 (4) Scale 608, pp. 613, 614 : AIR 1996 SC 2133, p. 2137 : (1996) 5 SCC 71 (para 16), where contrary view is expressed. But it appears that the court in this case was dealing with ‘Heading’ and not ‘Marginal note’ and no fi nal opinion was expressed. 242 Emperor v. Sadashiv, AIR 1947 PC 82, P. 84 : 74 IA 89 : 48 Cri LJ 791. 243 Nalinakhya Bysack v. Shyam Sundar Haddar, AIR 1953 SC 148, p. 150 : 1953 SCR 533, Western India Theatres Ltd. v.
