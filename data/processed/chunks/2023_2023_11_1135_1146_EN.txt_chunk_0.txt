[2023] 11 S.C.R. 1135 : 2023 INSC 749 CASE DETAILS SURESH THIPMPPA SHETTY v. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Criminal Appeal No. 1541 of 2010) JULY 26, 2023 [VIKRAM NATH AND AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Appellants-accused (A4 and A2) were convicted u/s.302, s.120B, IPC and sentenced accordingly. Whether High Court was justifi ed in dismissing the appeals fi led by them and upholding their conviction. Administration of Criminal Justice – Reasonable doubt as to the involvement of the appellants in the crime – Conviction unsustainable: Held: There is suffi cient material on record giving rise to reasonable doubt as to the involvement of the appellants in the crime – Appellants were able to poke holes in the testimonies of PW1, PW2 and PW7 – This conclusion is only fortifi ed as co-accused A1 and A7 were acquitted and thus, the conspiracy angle dehors the said main conspirators, who are the masterminds as per the prosecution, cannot be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt – Undisputedly, the four persons in the car on the fateful date were (1) the deceased; (2) PW1; (3) assailant/shooter, who is absconding, and (4) A3 – Admittedly, the appellants were not present at the spot where the crime was committed i.e., in the car nor any direct/specifi c role in commission of the off ence being attributed to them and thus, their convictions cannot be upheld – Noor Mohammad Mohd. Yusuf Momin v. State of Maharashtra reported as [1971] 1 SCR 119 relied on by the High Court does not, in any manner, militate against this Court overturning a conviction when reasonable doubt emanates – Appeals allowed. [Paras 13 and 17] Administration of Criminal Justice – Reasonable doubt as to the version put forth by the prosecution: 1135 1136 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. Held: When this Court is confronted with a situation where it has to ponder whether to lean with the Prosecution or the Defence, in the face of reasonable doubt as to the version put forth by the Prosecution, this Court will, as a matter of course and of choice, in line with judicial discretion, lean in favour of the Defence – Life and liberty are not matters to be trifl ed with, and a conviction can only be sustained in the absence of reasonable doubt – The presumption of innocence in favour of the accused and insistence on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt are not empty formalities – Rather, their origin is traceable to Articles 21 and 14 of the Constitution of India – The presumption of innocence is a human right.
