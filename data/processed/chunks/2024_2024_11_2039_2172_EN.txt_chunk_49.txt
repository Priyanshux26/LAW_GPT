The findings of fact concurrently recorded by the trial court as also by the lower appellate court could not have been legally upset by the High Court in a second appeal under Section 100 CPC unless it was shown that the findings were perverse, being based on no evidence or that on the evidence on record, no reasonable person could have come to that conclusion.” (See also Iswar Bhai C. Patel v. Harihar Behera [(1999) 3 SCC 457] .) 14. We may, however, notice a few decisions in regard to the jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 100 2112 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of the Code. In Commr. of Customs (Preventive) v. Vijay Dasharath Patel [(2007) 4 SCC 118] this Court held : (SCC p. 128, paras 22-26) “22. We are not oblivious of the fact that the High Court’s jurisdiction in this behalf is limited. What would be substantial question of law, however, would vary from case to case. 23. Moreover, although, a finding of fact can be interfered with when it is perverse, but, it is also trite that where the courts below have ignored the weight of preponderating circumstances and allowed the to be influenced by inconsequential matters, the High Court would be justified in considering the matter and in coming to its own independent conclusion. (See Madan Lal v. Gopi [(1980) 4 SCC 255] .) 24. The High Court shall also be entitled to opine that a substantial question of law arises for its consideration when material and relevant facts have been ignored and legal principles have not been applied in appreciating the evidence. Arriving at a decision, upon taking into consideration irrelevant factors, would also give rise to a substantial question of law. It may, however, be different that only on the same set of facts the higher court takes a different view. (See Collector of Customs v. Swastic Woollens (P) Ltd. [1988 Supp SCC 796 : 1989 SCC (Tax) 67] and Metroark Ltd. v. CCE [(2004) 12 SCC 505] .) 25. Even in a case where evidence is misread, the High Court would have power to interfere. (See W.B. Electricity Regulatory Commission v. CESC Ltd. [(2002) 8 SCC 715] and also Commr. of Customs v. Bureau Veritas [(2005) 3 SCC 265] .) 26. In Dutta Cycle Stores v. Gita Devi Sultania [(1990) 1 SCC 586] this Court held : (SCC p. 587, para 4) ‘4. Whether or not rent for the two months in question had been duly paid by the defendants [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2113 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. is a question of fact, and with a finding of such fact, this Court does not ordinarily interfere in proceedings under Article 136 of the Constitution, particularly when all the courts below reached the same conclusion. But where the finding of fact is based on no evidence or opposed to the totality of evidence and contrary to the rational conclusion to which the state of evidence must reasonably lead, then this Court will in the exercise of its discretion intervene to prevent miscarriage of justice.’ (See also P. Chandrasekharan v. S. Kanakarajan [(2007) 5 SCC 669] .
