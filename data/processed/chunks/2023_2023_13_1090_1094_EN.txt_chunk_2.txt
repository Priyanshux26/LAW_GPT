Direction may be given to the Respondents to rectify the error in the Revenue records in respect of the property in Survey No.584 of Varkala owned and possessed by late K. Gopalakrishnan Nair by correcting it as 3.35 Ares instead of 2.24 Ares. 2. Direction may be given to the 4th Respondent to mutate the above mentioned property in Sy. No.584 (Re-surveyed in Sy. No.BL-102/03) in the name of the legal heirs of late K. Gopalakrishnan Nair viz. (1) G. Urmila, (2) G. Ushakumari and (3) G. Krishnakumar.” 9. Insofar as the jurisdiction of Lokayukta is concerned a Division Bench of the High Court in Sudha Devi K. v. District Collector9 had opined that in terms of Section 12(1) of the 1999 Act10, Lok Ayukta was not competent to issue positive direction. He can only submit a report with the concerned authority with its recommendations. They only have recommendatory jurisdiction. A Lokayukta or Upa Lokayukta is not appellate or supervisory authority over other competent forums created under diff erent statutes, as each of those statues provide its own remedial steps such as appeal, revision etc. The parties need to follow that procedure. The 1999 Act is not meant to override those procedures. The aforesaid of the Division Bench of the High Court was referred to in the case in hand, however, the same was ignored. 10. In a subsequent in District Collector and Another v. Registrar, Kerala Lokayukta, Legislative Complex and others11, the Division Bench of the High Court reiterated the law laid down in Sudha Devi K. case (supra). It was opined that the complainants therein had not availed the statutory remedies regarding rectifi cation of the mistakes in the revenue record. When a relevant statute provides for hierarchy of remedies, those should have been resorted to. The action of the Lokayukta was found to be without jurisdiction. 9 2017 SCC OnLine Ker 1264 10 The Lok Ayukta Act, 1999 11 AIR 2023 Ker 97 (cid:0) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:9) (cid:10) (cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:12) (cid:13) (cid:4) (cid:14)(cid:1) 109 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 11. In our view, in the aforesaid two s of the High Court, the provisions of the 1999 Act were rightly interpreted. However, in the case in hand, the direction issued by the Upa Lokayukta for correction of the revenue records was upheld, which goes totally beyond the jurisdiction of the Lokayukta. The direction given by Upa Lokayukta in its summary is extracted below: “3. In the circumstances, I direct Smt.
