Three other accused were not found to be involved in the offence and on conclusion of the investigation, no chargesheet was filed against them. PROCEEDINGS AFTER FILING OF CHARGESHEET 5.

Digital Supreme Court Reports 2020. The same is pending trial before the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, Court 15, Meerut.

Four eyewitnesses have been examined so far. Three eyewitnesses are yet to be examined. The statement of the appellant-complainant (PW-1) and three other eyewitnesses (PW-2, PW-3 and PW-4) have been recorded. The prime witnesses have elaborated the role of the respondents herein, i.e., Waseem (A-7), Nazim (A-8), Aslam (A-2) and Abubakar (A-1).

Earlier hereto, Waseem(A-7) was granted bail by the High Court vide dated 22nd August 20229. The said was challenged by the appellant-complainant before this Court10. Vide dated 14th October, 2022, this Court cancelled the bail granted to Waseem observing that it was apparent from a perusal of the dated 22nd August, 2022 passed by the High Court that Waseem was granted bail on the basis of a co-ordinate Bench granting bail to his father, Niyaz Ahmad, vide dated 4th August, 2022. Since the passed in favour of Niyaz Ahmad was set aside by this Court vide dated 30th September, 2022, the bail application filed by Waseem before the High Court was restored for fresh consideration and expeditious disposal, preferably within a period of one month from the date of receipt of the copy of the said . It is expedient to extract below the relevant part of the dated 30th September, 202211, passed by a Division Bench of this Court [of which one of us (Hima Kohli, J) was a member], overturning the passed by the High Court granting bail in favour of Niyaz Ahmad: “9. At the outset, it needs to be noted that this Court has had occasion to peruse a succession of s by the same Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (which were challenged in Special Leave 9 Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.26740 of 2022 10 Criminal Appeal No. 1784 of 2022 11 Criminal Appeal No.1722 of 2022 (Ajwar Vs. Niyaz Ahmad and Anr.). [2024] 5 S.C.R. 581 Ajwar v. Waseem and Another Petitions before this Court) containing identical reasons as recorded above for the grant of bail. As a matter of fact, in the counter affidavit, which has been filed by the first respondent, the fact that similar s have been passed by the Single Judge has been relied upon though with the submission that the first respondent should not be penalized for the High Court’s failure to record adequate reasons.
