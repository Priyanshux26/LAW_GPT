Further, it is submitted that the disability of the appellant is in relation to the whole body and is non-progressive.

She further submitted that the appellant would need admission in a special school or training by a special education teacher and that due to her condition, the appellant’s marriage prospects may be severely affected. 7. Smt. Mehta submitted that, taking into consideration the condition of the appellant, the High Court has erred in granting only Rs. 4,25,000/- towards the attendant charges by taking minimum wages of unskilled worker (Rs. 3,934/- per month) for a part time attendant. She further submitted that, the High Court has failed to award suitable amount of compensation under the head pain and suffering, as well as for future medical treatment of the appellant. 8.

Placing reliance on the Disability Certificate dated 10th January 2011, the learned counsel for Respondent No. 2 submitted that there is a likelihood of improvement in the condition of the appellant.
