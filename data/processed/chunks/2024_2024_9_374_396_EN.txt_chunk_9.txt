It is thus clear that the commencement certificate insofar as the first building is concerned is also after the Draft Development Plan was statutorily notified. The commencement certificates insofar as all other buildings are also after the Draft Development Plan was sanctioned by the State Government. It is thus clear that the commencement certificates in respect of all the buildings are after the date on which the Plot was reserved for GPP. 27. The learned Tribunal while allowing OA of respondent No.1 has also come to a conclusion that the GPP is also in violation of Rule 20 of 2016 Rules. For considering the correctness of the said finding [2024] 9 S.C.R. 387 Pune Municipal Corporation v. Sus Road Baner Vikas Manch and Others of the learned Tribunal, we will have to first consider as to which of the Rules are to be applicable to the said GPP. 28. It is the contention of the appellant-Corporation that the GPP would be covered by the 2000 Rules whereas it is the contention of the respondent No. 1 that the same would be covered by the 2016 Rules. 29. As per sub-rule (2) of Rule 1 of the 2016 Rules, the Rules were to be given effect from the date of their publication in the Official Gazette. The 2016 Rules were notified on 8th April 2016. As per Entry No. 7 under Rule 22 of the 2016 Rules, the time frame for establishment of necessary infrastructure for implementation of these Rules was to be created by the local bodies and other concerned authorities within a period of two years from the date of the said Rules coming into force. It is further to be noted that the application for authorization as per sub-rule (2) of Rule 4 of the 2000 Rules was made by the appellant- Corporation on 10th August 2015 in Form-I and the authorization was granted in Form-III of the 2000 Rules on 2nd December 2015. The processing plant also became operational on 17th December 2015. It is also to be noted that the SEIAA granted Environment Clearance in respect of the Organic Waste Management Plant at Talegaon, Dabhade after public hearing on 1st February 2016. The GPP and the Organic Waste Management Plant at Talegoan, Dabhade are part of the same Concession Agreement which was entered into between the appellant-Corporation and the respondent-Concessionaire on 30th March 2015. It could thus clearly be seen that the application for grant of authorization, grant of authorization, grant of Environment Clearance by the SEIAA and the commencement of the project was all prior to 8th April 2016 i.e. the date on which the 2016 Rules came into force. 30. It will also be relevant to refer to the Preamble of the said 2016 Rules, which reads thus: “Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 3, 6 and 25 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (29 of 1986) and in supersession of the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, except as respect things done or omitted to be done before such supersession, the Central Government hereby makes the following rules for management of Solid Waste, namely:-” 388 [2024] 9 S.C.R.
