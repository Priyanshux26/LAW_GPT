The Law Commission of India in its 2557 Report noted the concern of financial superiority translating into electoral advantage. '*° It was observed that lobbying and capture give undue importance to big donors and certain interest groups, at the expense of the ordinary citizen, violating “the right of equal participation of each citizen in the polity.”'%6 While noting the candidate-party dichotomy in the regulations under Section 77 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the Law Commission of India recommends to require candidates to maintain an account of contributions received from their political party (not in cash) or any other permissible donor. 67.
