Moreover, the Act introduced stringent penalties for non-compliance with its provisions as well as rules framed by the local government.178 This included imprisonment that extended to three years in certain cases, and fines extending to five hundred rupees, which was significantly high at that time. Additionally, in case of a previous conviction for offences under the Schedule of the Act, punishment could vary from seven years to transportation of life.179 The Act also prescribed punishment to an individual of a designated criminal tribe, if the court was satisfied that “he was about to commit, or aid in the commission of, theft or robbery” or “was waiting for an opportunity to commit theft or robbery”.180 Like the previous Act, courts had no jurisdiction to decide on the validity of the notifications issued by the local government.181 109. In 1919, based on the requests of local governments, the “Indian Jails Committee” was appointed by the Government of India to analyze the working of settlements constituted under the 1911 Act and make recommendations for better administration. The Committee stated that “the ultimate aim of the settlements should be the absorption of the settlers into the general body of the community”.182 Thereafter, the Act was amended in 1923 to make certain additions. The criminal tribes notified by the local government of a province could be restricted or settled in another province with the approval of the 175 Under the Reformatory Schools Act, 1897, “youthful offender” means any boy who has been convicted of any offence punishable with transportation or imprisonment and who, at the time of such conviction, was under the age of fifteen years. 176 Section 19, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 177 Section 25, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 178 Section 21, 22, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 179 Section 23, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 180 Ibid. 181 Section 28, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 182 The Criminal Tribes Enquiry Committee Report (1949-50), https://ia802807.us.archive.org/11/items/dli. csl.944/944.pdf, 6 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 567 Sukanya Shantha v. Union of India & Ors. government of that province.183 Before the internment of any criminal tribe in a settlement, a formal enquiry was required to ascertain the necessity of restricting that tribe in the settlement.184 The amendment also empowered the local government to deport criminal tribes to any princely states, provided the states consented and appropriate arrangements were made to restrict the movements of the criminal tribes.185 110. The law relating to criminal tribes was then consolidated as the Criminal Tribes Act of 1924.186 Another amendment to the Act happened in 1925 to clarify that if an individual from a designated criminal tribe moved to another district in the same province or to another province, he shall still be treated as a criminal tribe in that district or province.187 111. Several Indian States of pre-independent India had enacted their own local laws for the surveillance of criminal tribes. According to the Criminal Tribes Manual of Gwalior, an individual from a criminal tribe could be convicted with rigorous imprisonment up to one year, if he kept an arm or “means of locomotion such as horses, ponies, camels, donkeys, bicycles”.188 The general public was prohibited from selling any arms or means of locomotion to the criminal tribes, giving shelter to an individual from a criminal tribe not having a valid pass, or lending any cash to them.189 Absence of an individual of a criminal tribe from his specified residence without a pass was punishable with rigorous imprisonment from one to two years or whipping with 20 to 30 stripes.190 Other States’ manuals also prohibited criminal tribes from possessing any means of locomotion.191 The Rewa Wandering Criminal Tribes Act, 1925, applied in Vindhya Pradesh, required 183 Section 6, Criminal Tribes (Amendment) Act 1923 https://164.100.163.187/repealedfileopen?rfilename =A1923-1.pdf 184 Section 8, Criminal Tribes (Amendment) Act 1923 185 Section 12, Criminal Tribes (Amendment) Act 1923 186 Act No.
