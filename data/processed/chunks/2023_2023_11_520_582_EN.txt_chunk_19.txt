An of preventive detention, may be made before or during prosecution. An of preventive detention may be made with or without prosecution and in anticipation or after discharge or even acquittal. The pendency of prosecution is no bar to an of preventive detention. An of preventive detention is also not a bar to prosecution. (See : Haradhan Sahav. The State of W.B. and others, 1974 Cri.L.J.1479] 18. In Halsbury’s Laws Of England, it is stated thus:- “The writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum” unlike other writs,is a prerogative writ, that is to say, it is an extraordinary remedy,which is issued upon cause shown in cases where the ordinary legal remedies are inapplicable or inadequate. This writ is a writ of right and is granted ex debitojustitiate. It is not, however, a writ of course. Both at common law and by statute, the writ of habeas corpus may be granted only upon reasonable ground for its issue being shown. The writ may not in general be refused merely because an alternative remedy by which the validity of the detention can be questioned. “Any person is entitled to institute proceedings to obtain a writ of habeas corpus for the purpose of liberating another from an illegal imprisonment and any person who is legally entitled to the custody of another may apply for the writ in to regain custody. In any case, where access is denied to a person alleged to be unjustifi ably detained,so that there are no instructions from the prisoner, the application may be made by any relation or friend on an affi davit setting forth the reason for it being made.” 19. In Corpus Juris Secundum, the nature of the writ of habeas corpus is summarized thus:- “The writ of habeas corpus is a writ directed to the person detaining another, commanding him to produce the body of the prisoner at PESALA NOOKARAJU v. THE GOVERNMENT OF 549 ANDHRA PRADESH & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] a designated time and place with the day and cause of his caption and detention to do, submit to, and receive whatsoever the court or judge awarding the writ shall consider in that behalf.”‘Habeas corpus’ literally means “have the body”. By this writ, the court can direct to have the body of the person detained to be brought before it in to ascertain whether the detention is legal or illegal. Such is the predominant position of the writ in the Anglo- Saxon Jurisprudence.” 20. In Constitutional and Administrative Law By Hood Phillips & Jackson, it is stated thus:- “The legality of any form of detention may be challenged at common law by an application for the writ of habeas corpus. Habeas corpus was a prerogative writ, that is, one issued by the King against his offi cers to compel them to exercise their functions properly. The practical importance of habeas corpus as providing a speedy judicial remedy for the determination of an applicant’s claim for freedom has been asserted frequently by judies and writers.
