Venkat Palwai Law Associates, Advs. for the Respondents. YADAIAH AND ANR. v. STATE OF TELANGANA AND 607 OTHERS / OF THE SUPREME COURT SURYA KANT, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. These appeals are directed against the common dated 31.12.2021 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Telengana whereby the intra-court appeal preferred by the State of Telengana and its revenue authorities has been allowed, reversing the decision of the learned Single Judge. Consequently, the resumption dated 27.01.2007, which forms the core of the present disputes concerning the assignment of non- occupied land in the 1960s to landless Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe persons [Hereinafter, ‘Assignees’] for the purpose of cultivation, has been confi rmed. 3. Since these appeals arise out of a long-drawn saga wherein multiple rounds of litigation occurred between the parties before various forums, including this Court, it would be appropriate to discuss the same at length before delving into the issues of law raised before us concerning res judicata, nature of assignment and violation of conditions of assignment.
