for the Respondent. / OF THE SUPREME COURT 1. Delay condoned in SLP(C) Dy. No. 30718 of 2023 and all connected petitions. 2. Special leave granted. With the consent of the learned counsel for the parties, the appeals were heard. 3. In this batch of appeals the revenue questions four sets of s of the Delhi High Court, dismissing its appeals under Section 260A of the 708 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as ‘IT Act’). Though the facts in each appeal diff er, substantially for the purposes of clarity and completeness the facts in the appeal arising from SLP (C) No.6644 of 2016 are taken into account. The facts are that search and seizure proceedings were conducted in the premises of one M/s KOUTON Group on 19.02.2009. In the course of scrutiny, the concerned Assessing Offi cer (A.O.) having jurisdiction after issuing notice under Section 154 A of the IT Act, to the searched party, was of the opinion that some documents and material “belonging to” the respondents(s) assessee, were involved. Therefore, notices were issued to them by the AO having jurisdiction over their assessments on diff erent dates (i.e. 25.02.2010 in [SLP(C) No. 6644 of 2016 & SLP(C)No. 14447 of 2016], 12.03.2009 in [SLP(C)No. 23621 of 2016] and 11.08.2014 [SLP(C) Diary No(s). 30718/2023]). 4. Notice was issued by the concerned jurisdictional A.Os. to the said assessees who contended that the period for which they were required to fi le returns, commenced only from the date the materials were forwarded to their A.Os. The Revenue, on the other hand, urged that the date (relatable to the period for which six years returns were to be fi led by the assessee) was to be from the date when the search and seizure proceedings were conducted, in respect of the main assessee under Section 132. 5. The impugned upheld the of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to “ITAT”) which in turn affirmed the assessee’s arguments. 6. It is submitted on behalf of the revenue by Ms. Bagchi, learned counsel that the impugned is erroneous because the date referred under proviso to Section 153(1) is relatable to the second proviso to Section 153A, only as far as it concerns abatement. The revenue relied upon the ruling of a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court, reported as “SSP Aviation Ltd. vs. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax” reported in (2012) 346 ITR 177. 7. Sections 153A and Section 153C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to the extent they are relevant are extracted below:- ”153A.
