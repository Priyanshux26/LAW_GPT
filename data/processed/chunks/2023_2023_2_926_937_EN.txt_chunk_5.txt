It was noted that Section 42 of the VAT Act mandates an D assessee to maintain the record minimum for a period of six years from the end of the year, however, the revenue in whom the power of revision is vested, claimed that the record was not traceable even though it had only been 10 years since the relevant period. It was held that if such statement were to be accepted, it was not clear on what basis revised notices in Form IV and V were issued on 07.03.2015 as well as notice E of attachment in Form V dated 20.02.2018 under the RR Act, claiming arrears of tax from the assessee for the above said period. Noting that nothing prevented the revenue from issuing certified copies of the s pursuant to the request made by the assessee on 18.06.2018 (just about four months after revised Form V notice was issued on 20.02.2018), the F assessee’s stance is justified. 12. On the basis of this reasoning, the impugned was delivered. Since the revenue was unable to show how the service of assessment s for AY 2009-10 and 2010-11, was effected and when, the attachment notice issued in Form V dated 20.02.2018 invoking the G RR Act for recovery of a sum of ` 5,59,58,758/- was set aside. The court, however, clarified that it was open for the revenue to initiate recovery proceedings afresh only to the extent of arrears of tax due for the period 2005-06 to 2008-09 as crystalized under dated 31.03.2011 H 6 Paragraph 32 of impugned High Court . THE COMMERCIAL TAX OFFICER & ORS. v. NEERAJA PIPES 933 PVT. LTD. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] in accordance with law, by excluding the tax arrears shown as due for A the period 2009-10 and 2010-11. Contentions of parties 13. The revenue contends that the impugned is in error. Its principal submission is that the assessee was an established concern, B and had, in the past, occasion to contest its liability, even in respect of the same assessments. Notice of this court is drawn to the previous writ petition initiated by the assessee, whereby the court had remitted the matter for fresh consideration, and permitted filing of objections, despite which the assessee did not participate in the proceedings, leading to fresh s. Likewise, it was submitted that when a composite C attachment was made, and the revenue had gone to the court, filing a writ petition, it had specifically stated the extent of the assessee’s liabilities, which the latter did not dispute. It never alleged non-service of s, or that it was unaware of proceedings leading to those s. In these circumstances, its plea that it was not served with s, could D not be entertained; even otherwise, that was not the subject matter of its representations. Having regard to all these factors, the assessee was estopped from contending that the attachment s were vitiated in law. 14. Counsel for the assessee relied on the findings of the High E Court, and stated that the revenue’s arguments are meritless, with respect to service of assessment s. It was submitted that Rule 64, relied on by the High Court is unambiguous, as every assessee has a right to expect service of assessment s upon it, to enable it to seek appellate or revisional remedies.
