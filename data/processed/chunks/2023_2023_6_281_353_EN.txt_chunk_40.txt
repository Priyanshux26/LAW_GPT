It was also not necessary for a person manufacturing medical products to claim classification under Tariff Sub-Heading 3003.30 without establishing that the product had in fact been tested F on patients in controlled situations or that the outcome had not been tested for effectiveness. This would be particularly true in the cases where the products are claimed to be based on traditional Ayurvedic formulae. *** *** *** G 7.This Court has in similar matters come to the conclusion that items which may be sold under names bearing a “cosmetic” connotation would nevertheless remain medicines based on the composition of the items in B.P.L. H 336 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. CCE [1995 Supp (3) SCC 1 : (1995) 77 ELT 485]. 8. As far as the first three items listed earlier are concerned, this Court has in CCE v. Pandit D.P. Sharma [(2003) 5 SCC 288 : (2003) 154 ELT 324] and CCE v. Himtaj Ayurvedic Udyog B Kendra [(2003) 5 SCC 290 : (2003) 154 ELT 323] in connection with Banphool Oil and Himtaj Oil held that the Ayurvedic hair oils, were medicines and should be properly classified under Tariff Sub-Heading 3003.30, rather than under Tariff Sub-Heading 3305.10 or 3305.50…. C 9. As far as Items (4), (5) and (6) are concerned, for the reasons stated earlier, we are of the view that they are also properly classifiable under medicaments under Tariff Sub-Heading 3003.30.” (emphasis supplied) D 16. Apart from the above, on behalf of the respondent, reference has also been made to a decision of this Court dated 27.02.2019 concerning its product in relation to the entry in the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 and it has been asserted that therein, this Court accepted that the product in question was a medicine and not a cosmetic product. This Court observed and held as under: - E “6. Notably, the Commissioner had failed to address the specific plea of the respondent that the hair oil manufactured by the respondent contains ‘Arnica Mount Q, Cantharis Q, Cinchona Q and Pilocarpine Q’ and would, therefore, qualify to be a drug within the meaning of Section 3 of The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, F and if so, would be covered under Entry 37 of Schedule-I of the APGST Act; and not Entry 36 which is for general hair tonics, hair oils or hair lotions, as such. The High Court, therefore, reversed the conclusion reached by the Commissioner after noting the aforementioned contention of the respondent and, instead, held G that the respondent had produced sufficient material to show that the product manufactured by the respondent was a medicine and not a cosmetic product. 7. The fact that the respondent is using the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia referred to earlier in manufacturing of the hair oil H has not been traversed by the appellant. Neither has the COMMISSSIONER OF CUSTOMS, CENTRAL EXCISE AND SERVICE TAX, 337 HYDERABAD v. ASHWANI HOMEO PHARMACY [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] Commissioner dealt with that contention of the respondent nor A was such a plea taken before the High Court by the appellant.
