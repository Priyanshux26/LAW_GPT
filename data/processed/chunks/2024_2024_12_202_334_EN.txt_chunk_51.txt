In other words, the use of article “the” in Section 28 has no apparent relation with the proper officer referred to under Section 17. The proper officer under Section 28 could be said to be determinable only in the sense that he is a proper officer who has been empowered to perform the functions under Section 28 by means of a notification issued under Section 5 of the Act, 1962. 104. In Canon India (supra), this Court held that DRI officers did not have the power of issuing show cause notices under Section 28 as they did not fall within the meaning of the expression “the proper officers” used in Section 28 for the reason that they did not possess the power of assessment under Section 17 of the Act, 1962. However, as we have discussed in the previous parts of this , contrary to the aforesaid observations of the Court, DRI officers were notified as “the proper officer” for the purposes of Sections 17 and 28 of [2024] 12 S.C.R. 281 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. the Act, 1962 respectively vide Notification No. 44/2011–Cus–N.T. dated 06.07.2011 issued by the Central Government. Hence, those officers of DRI who were designated as “the proper officer” for the purpose of Section 28 by the aforesaid notification were competent to issue show cause notices under Section 28. 105. Craies on Statute Law1 has stated that “the language of statutes is not always that which a rigid grammarian would use, it must be borne in mind that a statute consists of two parts, the letter and the sense”. It was observed by this Court in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Ganesweara Rao, reported in AIR 1963 SC 1850 that the aforesaid rule of construction that the provisions of a statute are to be read together and given effect to and that it is the duty of the court to construe a statute harmoniously has gained general acceptance. In Management, S.S.L. Rly. Co. v. S.S.R.W. Union reported in AIR 1969 SC 513, this Court observed that the principle that literal meaning of the word in a statute is to be preferred is subject to the exception that if such literal sense would give rise to any anomaly or would result in something which would defeat the purpose of the Act, a strict grammatical adherence to the words should be avoided as far as possible. The above principles would help us to desist from affording undue stress on the definite article “the” used before the expression “proper officer” in Section 28 of the Act, 1962. vi. DRI officers as proper officers under section 2(34) 106. In Canon India (supra), this Court erroneously concluded that an officer from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) was not an officer of customs and therefore cannot function as a “Proper Officer”. The finding of the Court that the power conferred by the Board under Notification No. 40/2012-Customs (N.T.) dated 02.05.2012 was ill-founded is an error apparent.
