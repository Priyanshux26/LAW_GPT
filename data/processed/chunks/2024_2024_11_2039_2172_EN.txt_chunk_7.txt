[Para 177] 2.5 Section 74(3) of the IBC, 2016 provides for the punishment for contravention of the resolution plan – The Code comes down heavily on any knowing and willful contravention of the terms of the Resolution Plan, committed by any person, on whom the approved Resolution Plan has been made binding under Section 31 of the IBC, 2016 – A punishment of minimum one year which may extend up to five years or minimum fine of one Lakh which may be up to one Crore rupees, or both, has been prescribed for such a contravention – In light of such strict consequence provided for the contravention of the resolution plan envisaged under the scheme of the Code itself, there is good reason for us to ensure that the successful resolution applicants abide by their commitments made under the Resolution Plan – Therefore, it is suggested that the authorities including the NCLT and NCLAT must not aid the Successful Resolution Applicants in circumventing the strict mandates of the law by acceding to their requests to relax the terms of the plan itself. [Paras 178, 179] 2.6 One another suggestion that may aid in a coordinated and non-adversarial implementation of the Resolution Plan by all the stakeholders is that the Adjudicating Authority while approving a Resolution Plan under Section 31 of the IBC, 2016, should record the next steps which are to be taken by the respective parties for commencement of implementation of the approved Resolution Plan – This will ensure that the parties are ad idem about the next round of their obligations that each of them is required to discharge under the approved Resolution Plan and that they do not delay the implementation by initiating any further litigation on this aspect. [Para 180] 2.7 As regards the implementation of the approved Resolution Plan, it is suggested that the IBC, 2016 statutorily provide for the constitution of a Monitoring Committee, once the plan has been approved, for a smooth handover of the Corporate Debtor to the Successful Resolution Applicant – Presently, such a provision is [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2049 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. absent in the Code and it is the Adjudicating Authority that s for the constitution of a Monitoring Committee to ensure smooth implementation of the Plan – The CoC must be empowered to constitute the Monitoring Committee which may, by default, include the Resolution Professional and also include other nominees from the CoC and the Resolution Applicant respectively – Such a Monitoring Committee would be entrusted with the powers of monitoring and supervising the resolution plan till the expiry of the term of the Resolution Plan – The Committee shall also be required to ensure all statutory compliances during the implementation of the plan along with updating the Adjudicating Authorities, Financial and other Creditors about the status of implementation of the Resolution Plan, on a quarterly basis. [Para 181] 3.1 As regards certain efficiency issues within the NCLTs and NCLAT, it has been noticed over a period of time that there is a serious lack of timely admission and disposal of the applications filed as regards the initiation of CIRP, approval of the resolution plan and liquidation – This only adds to the uncertainty of the process and prolongs the dispute thereby jeopardizing the interest of all the stakeholders involved – Adjudication in a time-bound manner would help prevent any further deterioration of the value of the corporate entity – The integrity of the original timelines laid down by the Code and the Resolution Plan must not be allowed to be violated since it would dilute the objective of the Code in its entirety, erode investor confidence and hinder all corporate restructuring efforts.
