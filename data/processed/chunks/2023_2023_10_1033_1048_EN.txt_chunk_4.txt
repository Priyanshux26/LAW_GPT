H PRITINDER SINGH @ LOVELY v. THE STATE OF PUNJAB 1039 [B. R. GAVAI, J.] 3. Hence the present appeals. A 4. We have heard Mr. Keshavam Chaudhri and Ms. Jaspreet Gogia, learned counsel appearing for the appellants and Mr. Abhinav Bajaj, learned counsel appearing for the respondent. 5. Undisputedly, the present case is a case which rests on B circumstantial evidence. The law with regard to conviction in the case of circumstantial evidence is very well crystalised in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra1. 6. We may gainfully refer to the following observations of this Court in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda (supra): C “153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established: (1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established. D It may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned “must or should” and not “may be” established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between “may be proved” and “must be or should be proved” as was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of E Maharashtra [(1973) 2 SCC 793 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 1033 : 1973 Crl LJ 1783] where the observations were made: [SCC para 19, p. 807: SCC (Cri) p. 1047] “Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and F the mental distance between ‘may be’ and ‘must be’ is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions.” (2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the G accused is guilty, (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency, 1 (1984) 4 SCC 116 H 1040 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R.
