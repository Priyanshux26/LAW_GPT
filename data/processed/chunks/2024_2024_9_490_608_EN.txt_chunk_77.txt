Relevant portion of the is extracted below: “27. The appellant next contended, relying on Section 18 of the Limitation Act, that as there was acknowledgement of liability in regard to Contract no. 30/F-2 in the letter dated 28-10-1978, and the notice invoking arbitration was issued on 4-6-1980 within three years from 28-10-1978, he was at liberty to make any claim in regard to the contract before the arbitrator even though such claims had not been made earlier and all such claims have to be treated as being within the period of limitation. Such a contention cannot be countenanced. As noticed above, the cause of action arose on 14-4-1977. But for the acknowledgement on 28- 10-1978, on the date of invoking arbitration 4-6-1980, the claims could have been barred by time as being beyond the period of limitation. The limitation is extended only in regard to the liability which was acknowledged in the letter 122 See paragraph 21 of J.C. Budhraja (supra) extracted in paragraph 119 of this . 598 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports dated 28-10-1978. It is not in dispute that either on 28-10- 1978 or on 4-3-1980, the contractor had not made the fresh claims aggregating to Rs.67,64,488 and the question of such claims made in future for the first time on 27-6-1986, being acknowledged by OMC on 28-10-1998 did not arise.” (Emphasis supplied) 134. On the question of extension of limitation, where only a part of the liability, or a specific amount, is acknowledged during the period of limitation, there are long-standing decisions of various High Courts upholding the same principle as is discernible from the decision in J.C. Budhraja (supra). Some of these decisions are being noticed below. 135. In Bans Gopal v. Mewa Ram123 in the context of applicability of Section 19 of the 1908 Act, which is pari materia Section 18 of the 1963 Act, the question before the Allahabad High Court was, whether a creditor could recover Rs.585 when acknowledgment was in respect of Rs.200 only. One of the arguments was that acknowledgment of a sum of Rs.200 cannot be taken as an acknowledgment of a sum of Rs.585. Accepting the argument, the Court held: “4. ….. It is true that if no definite sum had been mentioned and there had been an acknowledgement in general terms the amount of the debt would have been discovered from the evidence as mentioned in Explanation 1, Section 19 of the Limitation Act. In the present case, however, there is a definite acknowledgement of Rs.200 and if this is to be used to save limitation, it could be done only with respect to the sum acknowledged, and not with respect to any sum that may be proved to be due on that date.” (Emphasis supplied) 136. In Kali Das Chaudhuri v. Drapaudi Sundari Dassi124 for the purpose of seeking the benefit of extension of limitation, the letter sought to be relied by the plaintiff as an acknowledgement made by solicitor of the defendant stated thus: 123 AIR 1930 All 461 : 1929 SCC OnLine All 152 124 AIR 1918 Cal 294: 1917 SCC OnLIne Cal 23 [2024] 9 S.C.R.
