for Democratic Reforms, (2002) 5 SCC 294, p. 309, para 19.] ” 16. In State of U.P. v. Jeet S. Bisht [(2007) 6 SCC 586], this Court held that issuing any such direction may amount to amendment of law which falls exclusively within the domain of the executive/legislature and the court cannot amend the law. 17. In Delhi Jal Board v. National Campaign for Dignity and Rights of Sewerage and Allied Workers [(2011) 8 SCC 568 : (2011) 2 SCC (L&S) 375], this Court while dealing with the issue made the observation that in exceptional circumstances where there is inaction by the executive, for whatever reason, the judiciary must step in, in exercise of its constitutional obligations to provide a solution till such time the legislature acts to perform its role by enacting proper legislation to cover the field. (See also Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan [(1997) 6 SCC 241 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 932 : AIR 1997 SC 3011]; Common Cause v. Union of India [(2008) 5 SCC 511 : AIR 2008 SC 2116] and Destruction of Public and Private Properties v. State of A.P. [(2009) 5 SCC 212 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 629 : AIR 2009 SC 2266] ) 18. Thus, it is crystal clear that the court has a very limited role and in exercise of that, it is not open to have judicial legislation. Neither the court can legislate, nor has it any competence to issue directions to the legislature to enact the law in a particular manner.” [emphasis supplied by us] 65. Constitution of India recognizes the independence and separation of powers amongst the three branches of the State viz. the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. Each of the branches are co-equal. The Parliament or the Legislature is entrusted with the function of legislation, i.e., enacting the laws. The Executive is entrusted with the function and power to implement those laws and discharge their functions in accordance with the provisions made in the Constitution of India and the laws so enacted. The Judiciary is entrusted with the function to ensure that the laws enacted by the Legislature 1012 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports are within the four corners of the Constitution of India and that the Executive acts within the four corners of the Constitution of India and the laws enacted by the Legislature. As to what should be the laws and the policy behind the said laws is clearly within the domain of the Legislature. It is a different matter for Judiciary to examine as to whether a particular piece of legislation stands the scrutiny of law within the limited grounds of judicial review available. However, giving a direction or advisory sermons to the Executive in respect of the sphere which is exclusively within the domain of the Executive or the Legislature would neither be legal nor proper. The Court cannot be permitted to usurp the functions assigned to the Executive, the Legislature or the subordinate legislature. The Court cannot also assume a supervisory role over the rule-making power of the Executive under Article 309 of the Constitution of India.
