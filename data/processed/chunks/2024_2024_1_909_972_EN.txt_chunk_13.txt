929 Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v. MB Power (Madhya Pradesh) Limited & Ors. 20. Shri Chidambaram lastly submitted that the bidders have no vested right to contract. Article 226 of the Constitution of India cannot be used to award a contract in favour of the bidder. In this respect, he refers to the following s of this Court: i. Tata Cellular v. Union of India7 ii. Rajasthan Housing Board and another v. G.S. Investments and another8 iii. Laxmikant and others v. Satyawan and others9 21. Shri Chidambaram, therefore, submits that the impugned and is not sustainable and is liable to be set aside. SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS 22. Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel, per contra, submits that unlike Section 62 read with Sections 61 and 64 of the Electricity Act, under Section 63 of the Electricity Act, the appropriate Commission only “adopts” tariff and does not “determine” tariff. However, in cases under Section 63 of the Electricity Act, the Central Commission is bound by the guidelines issued by the Central Government and it is required to exercise its regulatory functions, albeit under Section 79(1)(b) only in accordance with those guidelines. In this respect, he relies on the of this Court in the case of Energy Watchdog (supra) and Tata Power Company Limited Transmission (supra). 23. Dr. Singhvi submits that two issues that can be considered in a case under Section 63 of the Electricity Act by the Commission are: (1) as to whether the bidding process was transparent; and (2) as to whether the bidding process was held in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government. 24. He submits that once the tariff is an outcome of the bidding process and the bidding process is transparent and held in accordance with the Bidding Guidelines, the appropriate Commission is mandated to adopt such tariff and it does not have a discretion to go into the question as to whether it is market aligned or not. 7 [1994] 2 Supp. SCR 122 : (1994) 6 SCC 651 (para 94)= 1994 INSC 283 8 [2006] 7 Supp. SCR 868 : (2007) 1 SCC 477 (para 8, 9 and 11)= 2006 INSC 766 9 [1996] 3 SCR 532 : (1996) 4 SCC 208=1996 INSC 409 930 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 25. Dr. Singhvi further submits that while adopting an already determined tariff by the bidding process as per Section 63 of the Electricity Act, the issue of market alignment of respondent No.1’s bid does not and cannot arise for consideration in these proceedings. 26. Without prejudice to the aforesaid submissions, Dr. Singhvi submits that it is not permissible for the State Commission to go into the question of market alignment. He submitted that the respondent No.1’s quoted tariff was market aligned not only in the year 2013 but also today. Dr. Singhvi submits that in the recent tender for procurement of 160 MW electricity, conducted in pursuance to the permission granted by this Court, the lowest bid for 1st year tariff discovered and approved by the appellants is at Rs.5.30 per unit.
