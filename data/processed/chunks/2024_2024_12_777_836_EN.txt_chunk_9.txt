The High Court at Allahabad heard the Criminal Misc. Writ Application Nos. 4080 of 2009 and 32494 of 2009 analogously and disposed them vide the common and dated 19.04.2018. The High Court quashed the proceedings in Case Nos. 67 of 2008 and 67A of 2009 respectively essentially on the ground that sanction to prosecute the respondent nos. 1, 3, 4, and 5 respectively under Section 197 CrPC was necessary & since it had not been obtained, the trial cannot proceed. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow: “Admittedly, the applicants are public servant and case was registered under Section 34 Excise Act against main accused of the murder in the discharge of public duty but the sanction to prosecute for the offence committed at Firozabad was not granted by the State of M.P. to prosecute the applicants for the offence committed within the jurisdiction of the Police Station, Dakhin at Firozabad (U.P.) as is evident from the Annexure SA-I and SA-II to the supplementary affidavit. In the above circumstances, it ought not to be proper to allow the proceedings to be continued against the applicants and in case, the proceeding is allowed to continue against the applicants, it would be nothing but misuse of process of law. 790 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports In view of what has been submitted and discussed above, the applications have substance and are liable to be allowed. Accordingly, the applications are allowed and the proceedings pending before CJM, Firozabad as Case No. 67 of 2008 (State Vs. Niranjan Kumar Upadhyay) as well as Case No. 67A of 2009 (State Vs.
