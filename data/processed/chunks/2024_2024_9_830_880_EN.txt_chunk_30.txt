By communication dated 7th December 2009, the proposal of the Architect was specifically rejected. The petition was affirmed on 30th July 2012 i.e. two years after the prayer for grant of 100% TDR was turned down. The explanation for delay given by way of amendment to the petition is that on 7th March 2010, a file containing correspondence and s of the Supreme Court was handed over to the attorneys. It is stated that amendment of 17th June 2010 to the DCR was made available to the petitioners in July 2010. On 8th January 2011, the Legal Consultant of the fourth petitioner by writing an email enquired with the Solicitors whether draft was ready. On 25th January 2011, it is claimed that the draft was forwarded. Thereafter, on 18th July 2011, a meeting was held between the petitioners, their Legal Consultant and Architect. It is claimed that the documents were furnished by the Architect to their advocate on 15th June 2012 and, ultimately, on 30th July 2012, the petition was filed. This is hardly an explanation for delay of 2½ years, especially when in the facts, of the case after construction of DP Road, the possession of the same was handed over on 5th March 2005. There is no explanation for not claiming 100% TDR within three years from that date. Even after entrusting the case to the Advocate, there is a long delay. Hence, considering the gross delay and laches which is not at all explained, this is a case where a Writ Court should not allow the party to invoke its extra ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. (iii) WP No.839 of 2015 – Geeta alias Chandani Umesh Gandhi vs. The State of Maharashtra and others. 38. In Writ Petition No.839/2015, the possession of DP Road was handed over to the Municipal Corporation [2024] 9 S.C.R. 875 Kukreja Construction Company & Others v. State of Maharashtra & Others on 20th May 2005. On 31st December 2006, 25% FSI/ TDR in respect of the constructed road was granted. On 1st December 2009, the petitioner through her Architect requested to release balance 75% TDR towards the amenity developed. The perusal of the averments made in the petition shows that after lapse of 4½ years thereafter, by a letter dated 20th June 2014, the petitioner requested the Municipal Corporation to issue balance 75% TDR. Thereafter, there was a legal notice sent on 1st December 2014. The petition was filed one year thereafter in January 2015. There is absolutely no explanation as to why there is a complete inaction on the part of the petitioner from 1st December 2009 when the petitioner’s Architect applied for grant of remaining 75% additional TDR till 20th June 2014 when similar request was made by the petitioner. As there is no explanation for this inaction for a period of more 4½ years and the delay involved thereafter, this is not a fit case wherein a Writ Court should exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
