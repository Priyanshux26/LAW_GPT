It was enacted with reference to Entry 31 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the 1935 Act, which was similar to Entry 8 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, in respect of intoxicating liquors. The Act defined ‘intoxicant’ as “any liquor, intoxicating drug, opium or any other substance which the Provincial Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette declare to be an intoxicant…”129 ‘Liquor’ was defined to include “all liquids 127 1950 SCC OnLine Bom 57 128 “Bombay Prohibition Act” 129 Bombay Prohibition Act 1949; Section 2(22) 2006 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports containing alcohol”.130 The definition clause was challenged on the ground that it was beyond the competence of the State Legislature under the entries in List II and List III of the 1935 Act. Chief Justice M C Chagla, writing for the Bench, held that the State Legislature did not have the competence to enact laws with respect to the “legitimate use of alcoholic preparations which are not beverages” and “the use of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol”.131 In short, the High Court held that ‘intoxicating liquor’ in Entry 31 of List II of the 1935 Act did not include all liquids with alcohol, and thus, the definition was beyond the scope of the State Legislature. The reasons for the interpretation were thus: a. Liquor ordinarily means a strong drink as opposed to a soft drink. In any event, it must be a beverage which is ordinarily drunk; b. The difference in the words qualifying ‘liquor’ in entries 31132 and 40(a)133 of List II in the 1935 Act (the Entry corresponding to Entry 51 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution) is very significant. In Entry 31, the word used is ‘intoxicating’. In Entry 40(a), the word used is ‘alcoholic’. In the Whitepaper of 1933, the entry dealt with ‘alcoholic liquor’ which was substituted with the expression intoxicating liquor. With the substitution, non-intoxicating liquor was excluded from the scope of the Entry; and c. Medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol are neither liquor nor intoxicating. Thus, they are excluded from the scope of the Entry. The 18th amendment to the US Constitution prohibits the sale, manufacture and transportation of ‘intoxicating liquor’.134 The 130 Bombay Prohibition Act 1949; Section 2(24) 131 1950 SCC OnLine Bom 57 [36] 132 “31. Intoxicating liquors and narcotic drugs, that is to say, the production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase and sale of intoxicating liquors, opium and other narcotic drugs, but subject, as respects opium, to the provisions of List I and, as respects poisons and dangerous drugs, to the provisions of List III.” 133 “40. Duties of excise on the following goods manufactures or produced in the Province and countervailing duties at the same or lower rates on similar goods manufactured or produced elsewhere in India- (a) alcoholic liquors for human consumption…” 134 18th Amendment to the US Constitution; Section 1: “After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.” [2024] 10 S.C.R.
