In the instant facts therefore, the conclusion was that the Appeal was erroneously admitted by the District Judge and the same to have been dismissed as not maintainable on the ground of limitation. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PARTIES 5. We have heard at great length, the Learned Senior Counsel appearing for both parties, Mr. Parthiv K Goswami for the Claimant - Appellants and Mr. Rajshekhar Rao for the Respondent and have also perused the written submissions fi led. A. Claimant - Appellants 6. It is submitted that, the Learned Single Judge’s reliance on Vidyacharan Shukla v. Khubchand Baghel & Ors.15 (Five-Judges Bench) to arrive at the conclusion that the Appeal under Section 22(8) would be covered by Article 116 of The Limitation Act, 1963 was mistaken as, the majority view therein was that to attract Article 156 of The Limitation Act 13 Petition No. 263/2009 14 Hereinafter referred to as “The Code” 15 AIR 1964 SC 1099 (Five-Judge Bench) M/S NORTH EASTERN CHEMICALS INDUSTRIES (P) LTD. 829 v. M/S ASHOK PAPER MILL (ASSAM) LTD. [SANJAY KAROL, J.] 1908, the corresponding Section to Article 116 of the present Act, it was not necessary that the Appeal should be conferred by the Code itself. It would be suffi cient if the procedure governing the Appeal would be according to the Code. 6.1 Unlike the fact situation in Vidyacharan Shukla (supra) where the concerned provision was 116A (2) of the Representation of People Act, 1951, The Special Act herein and particularly the Appeal provision mentioned therein does not provide that the procedure governing the Appeal shall be in accordance with the Code. In particular, reliance is placed on paras 6-8, 18, 19 and 33 of the said Constitution Bench judgement. 6.2 Another “condition precedent” for the employment of Article 116 is that the Appeal governed thereby arise from an or a Decree. It is submitted that, in the present case, the passed is neither a Decree nor an . Further it is submitted that the dated 13 April 2005 which was the against which the subject Appeal had been fi led, was an passed by an executive offi cer who is neither a Court nor a Civil Court as recognised in Law. The Learned Senior Counsel relies on Nahar Industrial Enterprises Ltd. v. Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation16. In particular, paras 26, 67 – 69, 71 – 73, 85, 86 and 89 are relied upon. 6.3 The powers of the Civil Court, conferred upon the Commissioner of payments are for a very limited purpose. It is for this reason that Article 116 would not apply. Thereby meaning that the present Appeal is outside the purview of the Limitation Act and can be fi led at any time. Reference is made to Uttam Namdeo Mahale v. Vithal Deo & Ors.17 6.4 It is further submitted that without prejudice to the contentions made, even if it is concluded that Article116 of the Limitation Act would apply or that the time period to fi le Appeal would be “a reasonable period”, the matter may be remanded to the District Judge, as the Principal Civil Court of Original jurisdiction (being the Appellate 16 (2009) 8 SCC 646 17 (1997) 6 SCC 73 830 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R.
