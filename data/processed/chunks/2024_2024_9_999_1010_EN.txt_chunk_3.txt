11. Another aspect in need of consideration is as to whether the liability of the Insurance Company under the insurance certificate/policy granted by it would cover the incident. This is in reference to the question as to the date and time from when the concerned vehicle would be deemed to be covered by the policy. In the present case, the incident occurred on 11.04.2017 at 14:15 hrs, whereas the insurance policy discloses that insurance was obtained at 15:54 hrs on 11.04.2017. In this regard, on facts, the MACT has found that the premium was paid/given prior to the accident and it was the internal procedure, due to which the policy was issued the next day and, thus, coverage under the policy would begin from the day the money (i.e. premium) was received by the Insurance Company. 12. In Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v Dharam Chand, (2010) 15 SCC 141, the Court noted ‘When this appeal was taken up, the counsel for the Insurance Company very fairly stated that since the cheque for the premium amount was received by the Company at 4.00 p.m. on 7-5-1998, the insurance must be deemed to have commenced from that time and four hours later when the vehicle met with the accident, the owner must be deemed to have been covered by the insurance policy. We appreciate the fairness shown by the counsel for the Insurance Company.’5 Clearly, Dharam Chand (supra) did not 3 Para 110(iv) of Swaran Singh (supra). 4 Para 110(v) of Swaran Singh (supra). 5 Para 3 of Dharam Chand (supra). [2024] 9 S.C.R. 1005 National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Maya Devi & Ors. entail any examination of the law due to the fair stand taken by the insurer therein. However, herein we have examined the ‘Certificate of Insurance cum Policy Schedule’ which states ‘PERIOD OF INSURANCE From: 11/04/2017 To: midnight of 10/04/2018’. It also records ‘Date of commencement of risk : 11/04/2017’. In this factual backdrop, we have no hesitation to hold that the vehicle was insured when the accident took place. As such, currently, we need not dwell on the law, except to reiterate the view in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v Sobina Iakai (Smt), (2007) SCC 786 [considering the position, and change, in law enunciated in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v Ram Dayal, (1990) 2 SCC 680; National Insurance Co. Ltd. v Jikubhai Nathuji Dabhi, (1997) 1 SCC 66; Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v Sunita Rathi, (1998) 1 SCC 365; New India Assurance Co. v Bhagwati Devi, (1998) 6 SCC 354; New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v Sita Bai, (1999) 7 SCC 575; National Insurance Co. Ltd. v Chinto Devi, (2000) 7 SCC 50 and J Kalaivani v K Sivashankar, JT (2001) 10 SC 396] that ‘…the effectiveness of the insurance policy would start from the time and date specifically incorporated in the policy and not from an earlier point of time.’6 13. The Insurance Company has not been able to prove that it had not received the money/premium prior to the accident and the only stand taken was that the insurance was fraudulently obtained.
