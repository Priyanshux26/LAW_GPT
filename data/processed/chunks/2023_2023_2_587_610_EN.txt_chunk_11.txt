B 20. There are a series of s on the said issue. Some have set aside the conviction, sentence and have terminated the proceedings, others have upheld the conviction but on the basis of sentence already undergone being more than the maximum permissible under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 20004 have directed for release of the accused and third, where after maintaining the conviction, C this Court has referred the matter to the JJB for passing appropriate s on sentence. All the s delivered earlier which are briefly discussed hereunder relate to the 2000 Act. Present case falls under the 2015 Act as the offence itself is of the year 2017. 21. In the case of Jitendra Singh alias Babboo Singh and D another vs. State of Uttar Pradesh5, a two-Judge Bench of this Court confirmed the conviction but as the appellant therein could only be awarded imposition of fine, the existing fine of Rs.100/- was found to be grossly inadequate and accordingly, the matter was remitted to the JJB for determining the appropriate quantum of fine that should be levied on E the appellant and the compensation that should be awarded to the family of the victim. 22. Justice Madan B. Lokur, the first author of the dealt with the issue as to whether the conviction could be sustained by this Court or it was only the sentence which was to be dealt with in accordance with the 2000 Act. Almost all the previous s were F referred to in paragraphs 24, 24.1 to 24.7, 25, 25.1 to 25.2, 26, 26.1 to 26.2 and 27 of the report with respect to all the four categories of the cases wherein different views have been taken by this Court. The first category was where conviction was upheld but sentence quashed. The second category was where conviction was upheld but sentence was G modified to the period already undergone. The third category was where conviction and sentence both were set aside and the fourth category was where the conviction was upheld and the matter referred to the JJB 4 In short “2000 Act” H 5 2013 (11) SCC 193 KARAN @ FATIYA v. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH 603 [VIKRAM NATH, J.] for awarding a suitable sentence. In paragraph 28 of the report Justice A Lokur sums up the four categories. Further in paragraph 29, reference is made to section 20 of the 2000 Act and it was finally concluded in paragraph 30 that the matter needs to be examined on merits and if the juvenile is found guilty of the offence, he could not be allowed to go unpunished but considering the provisions of the 2000 Act, the question B of sentence must be left to the JJB. It would be proper to reproduce paragraphs 28, 29 and 30 of the report of Justice Lokur, which read as follows: “28.The sum and substance of the above discussion is that in one set of cases this Court has found the juvenile guilty of the C crime alleged to have been committed by him but he has gone virtually unpunished since this Court quashed the sentence awarded to him.
