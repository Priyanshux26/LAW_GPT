Digital Supreme Court Reports 31. It could thus clearly be seen that the Preamble itself states that though the 2016 Rules are in supersession of the 2000 Rules, they will apply except as respect things done or omitted to be done before such supersession. 32. It will be relevant to refer to the following observations of this Court in the case of State of Punjab v. Harnek Singh,15 wherein this Court after considering the earlier decisions has observed thus: “16. The words “anything duly done or suffered thereunder” used in clause (b) of Section 6 are often used by the legislature in saving clause which is intended to provide that unless a different intention appears, the repeal of an Act would not affect anything duly done or suffered thereunder. This Court in Hasan Nurani Malak v. S.M. Ismail, Asstt. Charity Commr., Nagpur [AIR 1967 SC 1742] has held that the object of such a saving clause is to save what has been previously done under the statute repealed. The result of such a saving clause is that the pre-existing law continues to govern the things done before a particular date from which the repeal of such a pre-existing law takes effect. In Universal Imports Agency v. Chief Controller of Imports and Exports [AIR 1961 SC 41 : (1961) 1 SCR 305] this Court while construing the words “things done” held that a proper interpretation of the expression “things done” was comprehensive enough to take in not only the things done but also the effect of the legal consequence flowing therefrom.” 33. It can thus be seen that this Court has in unequivocal terms held that the term “things done” was comprehensive enough to take in not only the things done but also the effect of the legal consequences flowing therefrom. 34. In the present case, as already discussed hereinabove, the application for authorization, the grant of authorization, the grant of Environment Clearance by the SEIAA and the commencement of the GPP all have taken place prior to 8th April 2016 i.e. the date on which the 2016 Rules came into force. As such, we hold that the learned Tribunal has grossly erred in observing that the GPP in question was covered by the 2016 Rules. 15 [2002] 1 SCR 1060 : (2002) 3 SCC 481 : 2002 INSC 84 [2024] 9 S.C.R. 389 Pune Municipal Corporation v. Sus Road Baner Vikas Manch and Others 35. The next finding of the learned Tribunal is with regard to the consent under the Water Act or the Air Act. A perusal of the Minutes of the 11th Consent Committee Meeting of 2015-16 held on 9th November 2015 would clearly reveal that the MPCB was following the practice of granting authorization under the 2000 Rules which covers all the aspects of the consent. As such, MPCB did not find it necessary to cover such processing plant for the consent management. 36. It will be relevant to refer to the Circular issued by the MPCB dated 6th September 2021, which reads thus: “Board is receiving applications from solid waste Management Facilities and ULBs for grant of consent for installation and operation of the facility.
