These appeals arise from a of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity1 dated 26 July 2024. 2. Kerala State Electricity Board Limited, the appellant, floated two separate tenders for the procurement of power through a competitive bidding process under Section 63 of the Electricity Act 2003.2 The first was for procuring 450 MW of power and the second was for 400 MW. 3. Two entities emerged as L1 bidders in respect of the two tenders which were floated. However, the L1 bidders did not bid for the entire tender quantum. The L1 bidder in the first bid offered to supply only 200 MW out of the total quantum of 450 MW. Similarly, the L1 bidder in the second bid offered to supply only 100 MW as against the 400 MW for which the bid had been invited. The appellant invited the other bidders to match the tariff quoted by the L1 bidders for the remaining quantum. None of the other bidders in the first bid were willing to match the tariff quoted by the L1 bidder therein. However, in relation to the second bid, the L2 to L5 bidders conveyed their willingness to match the tariffs quoted by the L1 bidder. 4. With regard to the first bid, despite the L2 bidder refusing to match the tariff of the L1 bidder, the appellant accepted its tariff for 115 MW 1 “APTEL” 2 “Act” 974 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and justified it on the ground that the tariff was competitive and less than the tariff quoted by the L1 bidder in the second bid. Since the tariff quoted by the remaining bidders in the first bid was either equal to or more than the tariff derived in the second bid, the appellant did not consider their offers. Therefore, in the first bid out of the tendered quantity of 450 MW, the appellant accepted offers for a quantum of 315 MW and issued letters of acceptance to L1 and L2 for 200 MW and 115 MW, respectively. 5. With regard to the second bid, the appellant accepted the offers of the L2, L3, L4 and L5 bidders, who matched the tariff quoted by the L1 bidder.
