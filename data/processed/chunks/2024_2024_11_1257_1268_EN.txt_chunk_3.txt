3.7. Aggrieved by the Trial Court’s decision, the defendants filed an appeal before the District Judge, Rohtak. The First Appellate Court, after reappreciating the evidence, allowed the appeal on 8th October 1987 and dismissed the plaintiffs’ suit. The Appellate Court held that: • The plaintiffs failed to prove their ownership, as they did not produce the sale deeds or mutation records establishing their title. • The jamabandi entries in favor of the plaintiffs were doubtful and appeared to be manipulated. • The defendants and their predecessors had been in continuous possession of the suit land since 1879-80. 1262 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports • The defendants’ possession was open, continuous, and adverse, thereby perfecting their title by adverse possession. • The plaintiffs were attempting to grab the land by manipulating revenue records. 3.8. The plaintiffs filed RSA No. 3818 of 1987 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, challenging the of the First Appellate Court. The High Court framed the following substantial questions of law: “I. Whether the State can set up the plea of adverse possession, and does it imply admitting the title of the plaintiffs? II. Whether the and decree of the Lower Appellate Court suffer from illegality and perversity?” The High Court allowed the appeal, holding that: • By taking the plea of adverse possession, the defendants impliedly admitted the title of the plaintiffs. • The State cannot claim title through adverse possession against its own citizens. • The defendants failed to specifically deny the plaintiffs’ title as required under 8 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. • The possession of the defendants was permissive, as evidenced by the Misal Hakiyat of 1879-80. • The First Appellate Court erred in shifting the burden of proof onto the plaintiffs and in not appreciating the evidence correctly. 3.9. Aggrieved by the High Court’s , the defendants (now appellants) have approached this Court. 4. We have heard Shri Vikramjeet Banerjee, learned Additional Solicitor General for the Appellants and Shri Santosh Paul, learned Senior Counsel for the Respondents. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1263 The State of Haryana & Anr. v. Amin Lal (Since Deceased) Through His Lrs & Ors. 5. Mr. Vikramjeet Banerjee, learned A.S.G, appearing on behalf of the appellant the State of Haryana and its authorities, has argued that the High Court erred in overturning the well-reasoned of the First Appellate Court, which had dismissed the plaintiffs’ suit. The gist of his arguments is as follows: (i). Plaintiffs’ Failure to Prove Title: The appellants assert that the plaintiffs did not produce any substantive evidence to establish their ownership of the suit property. Despite opportunities provided by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court, the plaintiffs failed to present any sale deeds or title documents. Mere reliance on jamabandi (revenue records) is insufficient to confer title, as revenue entries do not create or extinguish ownership rights. (ii). Burden of Proof Misplaced: The appellants further argue that the High Court incorrectly shifted the burden of proof onto the defendants to establish who the real owner is.
