Construing the provisions of Article 291, Hidayatullah, J. held that the immediate and dominant purpose of Article 291 was to ensure payment of Privy Purses, charge them under the Consolidated Fund and make them free of taxes on income. What was sought to be enforced was not the covenants of the instruments or agreements which were entered into with the Rulers by the Dominion but the mandate of Article 291 itself. The s of the President were held to be ultra vires. J C Shah, J. held that by the provisions 273 The Constitution (Twenty-sixth) Amendment Act 1971 232 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. enacted in Articles 366(22), 291 and 362, the privileges of the Rulers were made an integral part of the constitutional scheme by which a class of citizens, for historical reasons, was accorded special privileges. These privileges, the learned Judge held, could not be withdrawn arbitrarily by merely exercising the power under Article 366(22) to withdraw recognition. Article 291 was held to raise an obligation of the Union to pay the Privy Purses. K S Hegde, J. noted that the power under Article 366(22) was being exercised for a collateral purpose after the Bill to amend the Constitution to delete Articles 291, 362 and 366(22) had failed. The learned Judge held that it was not open to the Union Government to obviate complying with the provisions of the Constitution by taking recourse to the power under Article 366(22). 396. The decision of the Constitution Bench in Raghunathrao Ganpatrao v. Union of India274 arose from a challenge to the constitutional validity of the Twenty-sixth constitutional Amendment.275 Articles 291 and 362 of the Constitution stood repealed by constitutional amendment and a new Article, Article 363A, was inserted resulting in the deprivation of the recognition accorded to the Rulers, declaring the abolition of the Privy Purses, and extinguishing the rights and obligations in respect of the Privy Purses. 397. Adverting to the earlier decision in Madhav Rao Scindia (supra), the Constitution Bench noted that the obligation to pay Privy Purses emanated from the Constitution and not in the covenants and agreements which were executed by the erstwhile Rulers. The Court held that the guarantees and assurances given under the Constitution were independent of the documents relating to their accession. Hence, after the introduction of Articles 291 and 362, the agreements and covenants had no existence at all and no obligation emanated from them. Rejecting the argument that the Privy Purses constituted an essential part of the constitutional structure so as to be a part of the basic structure, the Court held that the permanent retention of the Privy Purses and the privileges and rights “would be incompatible with the sovereign and republican form of Government.” The Constitution 274 1994 Supp (1) SCC 191 275 Constitution (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act 1971 IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 233 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] Bench rejected the submission that the grant of the Privy Purses was a consideration for the surrender of sovereignty by the Rulers of the Indian States.
