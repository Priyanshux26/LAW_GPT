This is contrary to your own letter dated 08.04.2003 in which it has been mentioned that “The allegations and averments on either side need not be dealt with. The same are not admitted. The unpleasant dispute and controversy is thus closed on the above footing. Making false allegations publicly amounts to character assassination and defamation. I therefore request you to ensure that henceforth members of the managing committee do not publicly or otherwise make false defamatory statements against me. xxx xxx xxx xxx ” On perusal of the same, the reference to the letter dated 08.04.2003 made in the said letter of 11.08.2003, referring to the contents, particularly the lines “The allegations and averments on either side need not be dealt with.

Any correspondence of the appellant showing prior consent has also not been placed before us. The College Tribunal and the High Court recorded the finding relying on the letter dated 08.04.2003 attributing an acknowledgment by the appellant vide letter dated 11.08.2003.
