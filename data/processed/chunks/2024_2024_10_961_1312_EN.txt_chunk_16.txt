[121-128] Damage caused by the scheme of s.6A Citizenship Act, 1955 – s.6A – Special provisions as to citizenship of persons covered by the Assam Accord – Damage caused by the scheme of s.6A: Held: (per Pardiwala, J.) (Dissenting) Absurd and faulty mechanism has been prescribed u/s.6A – s.6A owing to its inherent problems of absence of temporal limit as to the period of application, and shifting of the onus of identification and detection of an immigrant as a foreigner on the State, has indeed resulted in the influx and continued presence of illegal immigrants into the State of Assam, to this date – Legislature instead of providing for a one-time process to avail the benefits of s.6A to all those who are eligible has instead provided a process where each immigrant of the 1966-71 category has to be first identified and then referred to the foreigner’s tribunal – Tribunal is then required to determine in each individual case whether the person referred is an illegal migrant, his date of entry in Assam, whether he is entitled to any benefits u/s.6A – More than 38 years having elapsed since s.6A came into effect, with the benefit of retrospect, s.6A, which was meant to dispel and discourage incoming illegal [2024] 10 S.C.R. 983 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 immigrants, turned out to be a beacon for the illegal immigrants from Bangladesh to come into Assam, by taking advantage of the poor mechanism which is prone to open abuse – Provision has far exceeded the time-limit within which it should have been made applicable, and has become vulnerable to misuse owing to the inherent arbitrariness – Assam Accord was a one-time political settlement, arrived at in the specific context of widespread violence and agitation in Assam – Extraordinary conditions existing in the years 1979-85 cannot provide a permanent and perennial ground for continuation of a manifestly arbitrary provision, which is uncertain and indeterminable owing to its sui-generis mechanism. [Paras 182, 189, 190, 195, 211] Doctrine of Prospective Overruling Doctrines/Principles – Doctrine of prospective overruling – Application of – s.6A, if unconstitutional with prospective effect: Held: (per Pardiwala, J.) (Dissenting) : This Court has been endowed with the power to mould the relief so as to do complete justice in a given situation, and to avoid the possibility of chaos and confusion that may be caused in the society at large – In the instant case, a number of immigrants who came into the State of Assam from Bangladesh, have already been conferred with citizenship u/s.6A – Unconstitutionality of s.6A is attributable to the efflux of time – s.6A being manifestly arbitrary, temporally unreasonable and, demonstrably unconstitutional cannot be allowed to continue for all times to come – Thus, s.6A declared as unconstitutional with prospective effect – This would ensure that the benefit which has already been derived by the immigrants in Assam is not taken away, more particularly when the challenge to s.6A has been made after a considerable delay.
