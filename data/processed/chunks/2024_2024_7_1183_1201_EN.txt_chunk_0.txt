Headnotes† Customs Act, 1962 – s.125 – Whether there is a liability to pay customs duty when the confiscated goods are redeemed after payment of fine under Section 125 of the Customs Act, 1962: Held: The owner of goods has a liability to pay customs duty, even after confiscated goods are redeemed after payment of fine and other charges under Section 125 of the Act – When confiscation proceedings are initiated under Section 124 of the Act, the obligation to pay duty and other charges under Section 125(2) will arise only when the owner of goods exercises the option to pay fine for redemption of goods and the Department accepting it. [Paras 8.2, 8.4] Customs Act, 1962 – Whether, the liability to pay such duty will include the liability to pay interest on delayed payment under Section 28AB of the Act: Held: The text of Section 125(2) clearly provides that, where any fine in lieu of confiscation of goods is imposed under sub-Section (1), the owner of such goods shall be ‘liable to any duty and charges payable with respect to such goods’– The sub-section provides that the liability to any duty and charges, that are payable, shall be paid in addition to the fine – Section 28 would come into operation for assessing and determining the duty and other charges payable with * Author 1184 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports respect to goods redeemed under Section 125(2) – Once Section 28 applies for determination of duty obligation arising under Section 125(2), the interest on delayed payment of duty arises under Section 28AB – The said provision obligates payment of interest in addition to the duty – Thus, the question is answered by holding that the interest liability under Section 28 AB is also attracted.
