Making the above submissions it is prayed to allow the present appeal and direct the respondents to appropriate the payment of G Rs.1,24,28,500/- towards settlement dues under the Scheme 2019 and that discharge certificate be issued to the appellant accordingly. 4. While opposing the present appeal, Shri Vikramjit Banerji, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the Union of India has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case no error has H M/S. SHEKHAR RESORTS LIMITED (UNIT HOTEL ORIENT 1119 TAJ) v. UNION OF INDIA [M. R. SHAH, J.] been committed by the Hon’ble High Court in dismissing the writ petition A and refusing to direct the respondents to accept the payment towards the settlement dues under the Scheme, 2019. 4.1 It is submitted that admittedly the Scheme was valid upto 30.06.2020 and the last date for payment of settlement amount under the Scheme, 2019 was 30.06.2020. That thereafter the Scheme was B closed and even the Designated Committees were also dissolved and therefore as rightly observed by the Hon’ble High Court, the Hon’ble High Court has no jurisdiction to extend the Scheme. It is submitted that if the Scheme is extended it would create many complications. 4.2 It is further submitted that in the present case, admittedly, no C payment was made of settlement amount under the Scheme prior to 30.06.2020 and therefore, the prayer of the original petitioner to extend the time limit to make the payment of settlement amount under the Scheme, 2019 was rightly rejected by the Commissioner and the same has rightly not been interfered with by the Hon’ble High Court. D Making above submissions it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal. 5. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the respective parties at length. 6. At the outset, it is required to be noted and it is not in dispute E that the appellant is entitled to the benefit of the settlement under the Scheme, 2019. The Scheme, 2019 came to be introduced on 01.09.2019 and the last date for making the application under the Scheme was 30.12.2019 and in fact, the appellant submitted the application in Form No.1 on 27.12.2019 i.e. before the last date specified for making an F application. Under the Scheme, after the Form No.1 is processed the Designated Committee was to scrutinize the same and issue the Final Form No.3 determining the settlement amount which the applicant was required to deposit within a period of one month from the date of receipt of the final determination – Form No.3. That the appellant was issued the Form No.3 on 25.02.2020 and was required to pay the settlement G dues on or before 25.03.2020. However, in view of the COVID-19 Pandemic the Government extended the time upto 30.06.2020. Therefore, the appellant was required to deposit the settlement dues on or before 30.06.2020. However, even before the Scheme, 2019 came to be introduced, the appellant was subjected to proceedings under the IBC H 1120 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R.
