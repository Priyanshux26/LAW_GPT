The details of the number of khasras allotted to both the parties i.e., to Jhabbar Singh and others and to Jagtar Singh were also mentioned in the said . The partition having been accepted as per the said C “Naksha Be”, the joint status of the parties had stood severed. Of course, the said dated 31.07.1982 was challenged by the plaintiff Jagtar Singh by way of an appeal before the Collector who vide the dated 12.10.1982 had dismissed the same. The said of Collector was further challenged by the said Jagtar Singh by filing revision D application before the Commissioner. Though, the Commissioner had initially granted stay against the operation of the dated 31.07.1982 upto 16.11.1982, admittedly the said stay was not further extended thereafter. Under the circumstances, the joint status of the parties had come to an end on 31.07.1982, when the Assistant Collector passed the and when the same was confirmed by the Collector on 19.10.1982. E The trial court and the appellate court, under the circumstances, had rightly held that the plaintiff Jagtar Singh did not possess the status of co-sharer on the date of decree i.e., on 01.12.1982, and that his right of pre-emption had not survived till the date of passing of the decree in the suits. In our opinion, the High Court had grossly erred in misinterpreting F the provisions of Punjab Pre-emption Act and of Land Revenue Act, and in setting aside the s and decrees passed by the trial court and the appellate court. 33. In that view of the matter, the impugned common passed by the High Court deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly G set aside. Both the appeals stand allowed accordingly. Nidhi Jain Appeals allowed. (Assisted by : Bhavyata Kapoor and Rakhi, LCRAs) H
