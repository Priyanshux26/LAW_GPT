F 107. The CERC has further found that the SHR given in the bid are under test conditions and may vary from actual SHR. The CERC has specifically observed that after extensive stakeholders’ consultation, the CERC has specified the SHR norms in the 2014 Tariff Regulations. It, therefore, found that it will be appropriate to take SHR specified in G the Regulations as a reference point instead of other parameters as suggested by MSEDCL. 108. The CERC further found that the CERC norms applicable to the period 2009-14 and 2014-19 do not provide the norms for 300 MW units, but provide for a degradation factor of 6.5% and 4.5% respectively H 136 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A towards Heat Rate over and above the Design Heat Rate. The CERC found that since the Design Heat Rate was 2211 kcal/kWh, the gross Heat Rate worked out to 2355 kcal/kWh (2211 x 1.065) and 2310 kcal/ kWh (2211 x 1.045) for the period 2009-14 and 2014-19 respectively. The CERC, therefore, directed that the SHR of 2355 kcal/kWh during the period 2009-14 and 2310 kcal/kwh during the period 2014-19 or the B actual SHR, whichever is lower, shall be considered for calculating the coal consumption for the purpose of compensation under the Change in Law. 109. These findings of the CERC are affirmed by the learned APTEL in its dated 16th July 2021. The learned APTEL C observed thus: “8.8 We are in agreement with the observations made by the CERC. Relegating the Appellant to the contractual remedy under the FSA when the genesis of the Appellant’s claim is Change in Law under the PPA would not be D appropriate. It is, however, made clear that if the Appellant were to receive any disincentive or compensation from the coal company on account of short supply or grade slippage, such compensation will be adjusted/credited against the Change in Law compensation payable by the Respondent, E MSEDCL.” 110. The learned APTEL in its dated 14th September 2020 in Appeal No.182 of 2019 in the case of Adani Power Maharashtra Limited (APML) v. Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. (impugned in Civil Appeal No. 684 of 2021) has referred to the of MERC dated 7th March 2018 in Case No.123 of 2017 F (JSW Energy Ltd. v. MSEDCL), wherein it held that Auxiliary Consumption has to be considered as lower of actual or MYT norms for the purpose of the Change in Law compensation. The learned APTEL held that in view of its earlier , the State Commission, being MERC, ought to have followed the same approach for SHR in the present case G also. It has been found that there is no reason for the MERC to apply two different principles for Auxiliary Consumption and SHR, when both are operational parameters and the Commission was dealing with the same PPA in both cases. 111. The learned APTEL has also referred to the following H observations of the CERC in its dated 16th May 2019 in the case MAHARASHTRA STATE ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION CO. LTD. v. 137 ADANI POWER MAHARASHTRA LTD. [B. R. GAVAI, J.]
