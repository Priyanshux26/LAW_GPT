Chapter 24 dealt with tobacco and manufactured tobacco substitutes and the relevant sub-heading at that H M/S TRIMURTHI FRAGRANCES (P) LTD. THR. ITS DIRECTOR SHRI 1071 PRADEEP KUMAR AGRAWAL v. GOVT. OF N.C.T. OF DELHI THR. ITS PRINCIPAL SECRETARY (FINANCE) [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] time was 2404.41 which deals with chewing tobacco, including A preparations commonly known as khara masala, kimam, dokta, zarda, sukha and surti. 47. Parliament Act 22 of 1995, substituted Note-3 to Chapter 21 of the CET Act. “Pan Masala” was described as “any preparation containing betel nuts and any one or more of the following B ingredients, viz., lime, katha, katechu or tobacco, whether or not containing any other ingredients such as cardamom, copra and menthol”. The primary ingredient of pan masala therefore, is betel nut, which could be mixed with other ingredients in combination or in isolation. This position prevailed as on 01.03.1988. In 1995, the definition underwent C a change. Betel nuts remained the essential ingredient along with “lime, katha or tobacco” together, or separately. Whether the product contained cardamom, copra, and menthol or not was irrelevant: yet one of the three ingredients (lime, katha and tobacco), had to be found in the preparation known as ‘pan masala’. By Parliament Act 33 of 1996, the description to Chapter Heading 24.04 and sub-headings under it were D re-numbered. The description of goods was re-classified. There was no change in Chapter 21; Heading 21.06 continued to be only ‘pan masala’. That changed with effect from 01.03.2001, through Note-3 which reads as follows: …”3. In this Chapter, ‘Pan Masala’ means any preparation E containing betel nuts and any one or more of the following ingredients, namely: i) lime; and ii) kattha (catechu) F but not tobacco, whether or not containing any other ingredients, such as cardamom, copra and menthol.” Note-6 in Chapter 24 read as follows: “6. In this Chapter, ‘’Pan Masala’ containing tobacco’, commonly known as ‘Gutkha’ or by any other name, means G any preparation containing betel nuts and tobacco and any one or more of the following ingredients, namely: i) lime; and ii) kattha (catechu), H 1072 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A whether or not containing any other ingredients, such as cardamom, copra and menthol.” 48. In Chapter 24, for sub-heading 2404.40 and the related entries, the following was substituted, namely: “Chewing tobacco and preparations containing chewing B tobacco; ‘Pan Masala’ containing tobacco. 2404.41 - Chewing tobacco and preparations containing chewing tobacco 2404.49.1 - ‘Pan Masala’ containing tobacco” C 49. Entry No. 2 of Part-J in the First Schedule to the ADE Act is similar to sub-heading 2404.49 - as amended from 01.03.2001. As a result, additional excise duty could be imposed on ‘’Pan Masala containing tobacco”. As far as Kothari Products Ltd. (supra) is concerned, a Full Bench of the (undivided) Andhra Pradesh High Court had examined the interface between the APGST Act, and the provisions D of the CET Act, in the context of whether gudaku was subjected to sales tax levy, as the dealers had contended that it was tobacco, and therefore, exempt under the local law.29The Full Bench ruling considered the local enactments, and sub-headings in Chapters 21 and 24 of the CET Act, and held that although gutkha falls within the term ‘pan E masala’, since no additional duty of excise is levied on it, yet it could not be held that gutkha was exempt from state sales tax.
