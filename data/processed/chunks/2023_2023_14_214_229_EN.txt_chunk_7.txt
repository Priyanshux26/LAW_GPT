It appears that the Viscera of the deceased was collected and sealed in two separate boxes by the PW-18 on 24.07.2003 and were sent for chemical examination to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Chhattisgarh, which received the same on 18.09.2003. Thereafter, the Senior Scientifi c Offi cer, FSL, Raipur submitted the following Test result, vide the letter dated 10.08.2004 (Ex. P/14): TEST RESULT “Exhibit A and B contain Organophosphorus pesticide and Quinolphos. Exhibit C does not contain any chemical poison.” 16. After the receipt of the afore-stated report from the Senior Scientifi c Offi cer, the PW-15 Shyam Kori, SHO Bilha, District Bilaspur registered the FIR being Crime No. 175/04 at police station Ratanpur on 03.11.2004 against the appellant-accused for the off ence under Section 302 of IPC. He 224 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. has stated in his evidence that the said FIR was registered on the basis of the evidence collected during the investigation in the Merg No. 43/03 under Section 174 of Cr.PC at police station Ratanpur, and thereafter, he recorded the statements of witnesses. On the completion of the investigation the chargesheet was fi led by PW-19 I.H. Khan, SDO(P), Bilaspur in the Court. 17. From the afore-stated evidence on record, it is discernible that though the FIR was registered against the appellant on 03.11.2004 in respect of the incident which had taken place on 22.07.2003, a part of investigation had already started on the death of Bisahu Singh and on the Merg intimation no.43/03. Apparently, one may feel that there was a delay of more than one year in registering the FIR, however the chain of circumstances which took place during the said one year clearly suggests that the deceased was taken to the CIMS Hospital, Bilaspur immediately on 23.07.2003 in the morning, and he expired at about 3.30 PM on the same day. His post-mortem was carried out on the very next day i.e., 24.07.2003 and the samples of Viscera of the deceased collected by Dr. A.K. Shukla, were sent for Chemical examination to the FSL, Raipur, on 18.09.2003. It was the report of Chemical examination sent by the FSL Raipur, after one year, which caused the delay in the registration of the FIR. Thus, the entire delay as such could be attributed to the FSL, Raipur, which took almost one year in giving the report of Chemical examination of Viscera of the deceased. As such, there is no allegation on concoction of false version made against the prosecution. 18. It is true that the PW-2 Ganeshi Bai, wife of the deceased right from the beginning having alleged that her husband Bisahu Singh when was found lying in the verandah of her house in the morning hours on 22.07.2003, had told her in presence of her daughter PW-2 Anita Porte, PW-7 Kotwar Bhagwati, and other witnesses that the appellant-accused Hariprasad had called him at his place on the previous day evening and had mixed jadi- buti in the liquor, and the appellant made him to drink it, because of which the health of Bisahu Singh had deteriorated, she or any other neighbours/ relatives could have lodged a complaint against the appellant-accused on that day itself.
