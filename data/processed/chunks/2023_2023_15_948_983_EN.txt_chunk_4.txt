Being aggrieved by the same, the present appeal has been fi led. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PARTIES 6. We have heard the arguments of Ms. Rachna Srivastava, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the appellant and Mr. Rameshwar Prasad Goyal, learned counsel, appearing for the respondents. 7. It is the contention of Ms. Rachna Srivastava, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant, that the High Court committed a serious error in upsetting the findings of the Trial Court and the 954 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Revisional Court whereunder the discretionary power was exercised by condoning the delay while setting aside the abatement and allowing the application of the appellant herein to be brought on record as legal representative of deceased Urmila Devi; the High Court erred in not considering the fact that courts below had recorded a clear finding that appellant herein was the sole surviving legal representative of the deceased plaintiff and as such it ought not to have interfered with the well-reasoned passed by the Trial Court as affirmed by the Revisional Court; She would also contend that defendants in this suit who were the writ petitioners in WP(M/S) 342 of 2005 (old number 14655 of 1983) had substituted the appellant herein as legal representative of Urmila Devi in dispute related to the suit schedule property (involved in OS No.2 of 1982) and as such defendants cannot be permitted to take stand contrary to same. Hence, it is contended that impugned is liable to be set aside. 8. Per contra, Shri Rameshwar Prasad Goyal, learned counsel appearing for the respondents, supports the impugned and contends that in the Writ Petition No.144 of 2013, appellant herein who was a party therein had not filed a counter-affidavit and as such High Court had recorded that non-traversing of petition averments would amount to admission and had also taken note of the fact that appellant herein had filed an affidavit before the Trial Court on 25.10.2008 whereunder he has accepted the Will dated 19.05.1999 executed by deceased Urmila Devi and thereby supported the stand of Manoj Kumar Jain being the legal heir of Urmila Devi. He would also draw the attention of this Court to yet another affidavit dated 21.08.2009 filed by the appellant himself in OS No.2 of 1982 whereunder he has again supported the Will dated 19.05.1999 or in other words, supported the substitution of Shri Manoj Kumar Jain as legal representative of deceased Urmila Devi. Hence, he contends there is no illegality committed by the High Court. It is further contended that appellant was having knowledge of OS No.2 of 1982 and as such he cannot plead ignorance for the delay. Lastly, challenging the adoption on the ground that same cannot be the basis for the appellant herein to be brought on record, he has sought for rejection of this appeal. YASHPAL JAIN v. SUSHILA DEVI & OTHERS 955 [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION 9. Having heard the learned counsels appearing for the parties and after bestowing our careful and anxious consideration to the rival contentions raised at the Bar, we are of the considered view that following points would arise for our consideration: (i) Whether the impugned dated 28.11.2019 passed in Writ Petition (M/S) No.144 of 2013 quashing the s dated 13.12.2012 rendered in Civil Revision No.4 of 2012 by the High Court whereby the dated 09.05.2012 passed by trial court allowing the impleadment application fi led by the appellant herein had been rejected, is to be sustained or set aside?
