28. Debts owed to a secured creditor, whenever such secured creditor “has relinquished security in the manner set out in section F 52” receive a fairly high priority (immediately after insolvency resolution process costs), whereas in other cases, i.e., when the secured creditor does not relinquish security, the priority of claim is lower [Section 53 (1) (e) (ii)] in respect of “any amount unpaid following the enforcement of security interest”. Another feature is that amounts due to the government (i.e., payable into the Consolidated Fund of India or G Consolidated Fund of a State) are ranked in the same manner as those of secured creditors who do not relinquish their security interest [Section 53 (1) (e) (ii)]. 29. The Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee Report, 2015, which led to the framing and later enactment of IBC, pertinently stated that: H PASCHIMANCHAL VIDYUT VITRAN NIGAM LTD. v. RAMAN 1245 ISPAT PRIVATE LIMITED & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] “The Committee has recommended to keep the right of the A Central and State Government in the distribution waterfall in liquidation at a priority below the unsecured financial creditors in addition to all kinds of secured creditors for promoting the availability of credit and developing a market for unsecured financing (including the development of bond B markets). In the long run, this would increase the availability of finance, reduce the cost of capital, promote entrepreneurship and lead to faster economic growth. The government also will be the beneficiary of this process as economic growth will increase revenues. Further, efficiency enhancement and consequent greater value capture through the proposed C insolvency regime will bring in additional gains to both the economy and the exchequer.” ************* ************* ************* “For the remaining creditors who participate in the collective D action of Liquidation, the Committee debated on the waterfall of liabilities that should hold in Liquidation in the new Code. Across different jurisdictions, the observation is that secured creditors have first priority on the realizations, and that these are typically paid out net of the costs of insolvency resolution and Liquidation. In to bring the practices in India in- E line with the global practice, and to ensure that the objectives of this proposed Code is met, the Committee recommends that the waterfall in Liquidation should be as follows: 1. Costs of IRP and liquidation. 2. Secured creditors and Workmen dues capped up to three F months from the start of IRP. 3. Employees capped up to three months. 4. Dues to unsecured financial creditors, debts payable to workmen in respect of the period beginning twelve months G before the liquidation commencement date and ending three months before the liquidation commencement date; 5. Any amount due to the State Government and the Central Government in respect of the whole or any part of the period of two years before the liquidation commencement date; any H 1246 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R.
