He has cited the case of Rohitbhai Jivanlal Patel -vs- State of Gujarat and Another [(2019) 18 SCC 106] to contend that factors relating to source of funds and other documentary evidence for advancing money are not relevant for consideration on the question of rebuttal of presumption by the accused. 9. Mr. S. Nagamuthu, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the accused/respondent no.1, defended the of the First Appellate Court, as also of the High Court. His submission was that the complainant/petitioner did not fulfil the requirement of being “a holder in due course”, as no evidence was produced by the petitioner to show that the said cheques were issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt and hence, he could not be a person who had, for due consideration, become the possessor of the cheques. He referred to the depositions made before the Trial Court, in support of his submission that the presumption under Section 139 read with Section 118 of the 1881 Act was not applicable in the case of the complainant/petitioner because such presumption stood effectively rebutted. He relied on the of this Court in the cases:- (i) Basalingappa -vs- Mudibasappa [(2019) 5 SCC 418], (ii) K. Subramani -vs- K. Damodara Naidu [(2015) 1 SCC 99], (iii) Reverend Mother Marykutty -vs- Reni C. Kottaram and Another [(2013) 1 SCC 327] and (iv) Krishna Janardhan Bhat v. Dattatraya G. Hegde [(2008) 4 SCC 54]. 10. He further argued that, in to invoke the presumption under the aforesaid two provisions of 1881 Act, the jurisdictional facts had to be established by complainant/petitioner and any lacuna in the evidence 262 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the complainant would strike at the root of the complaint of this nature. He relied on the in the case of John K. Abraham -vs- Simon C. Abraham and Another [(2014) 2 SCC 236]. 11. We are dealing with a case where the First Appellate Court exercising its jurisdiction under Section 374(3) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, ongoing through the analysis of evidence, acquitted the accused/respondent no.1. The acquittal was further upheld by the High Court in an appeal against acquittal under Section 378 of the 1973 Code. The whole question involved in this proceeding is as to whether the cheques were issued in discharge of a debt and if it was so, then whether the accused/respondent no.1 was able to rebut the presumption in terms of Section 118 read with Section 139 of the 1881 Act. In the light of the of this Court in the case of Narendra Pratap Narain Singh -vs- State of U.P. [(1991) 2 SCC 623] the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India to interfere with concurrent findings of fact is not in question, when such findings are based on no evidence or are perverse. The question, we have to address thus, is as to whether the findings of the First Appellate Court and the High Court are on no evidence or perverse.
