[Paras 36, 43, 44] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge – “especially” – Meaning: Held: s.106 provides that when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him – The word “especially” means facts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally within the knowledge of the accused – s.106 166 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports refers to cases where the guilt of the accused is established on the evidence produced by the prosecution unless the accused is able to prove some other facts especially within his knowledge, which would render the evidence of the prosecution nugatory – If in such a situation, the accused offers an explanation which may be reasonably true in the proved circumstances, the accused gets the benefit – But, if the accused in such a case does not give any explanation at all or gives a false or unacceptable explanation, this by itself is a circumstance which may well turn against him. [Paras 36, 45] Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.8, 27 – ‘conduct’ – “relevant fact” – Weapon of offence, the knife was discovered at the instance of the appellant by drawing panchnama u/s.27: Held: Conduct of the appellant in leading the IO and others to a drain nearby his house and the discovery of the knife from the drain is a relevant fact u/s.8 – In other words, the evidence of the circumstance simpliciter that the appellant pointed out to the IO the place where he threw away the weapon of offence i.e., knife would be admissible as ‘conduct’ u/s.8 irrespective of the fact whether the statement made by the accused contemporaneously with or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of s.27 – Even while discarding the evidence in the form of discovery panchnama, the conduct of the appellant would be relevant u/s. 8 – The evidence of discovery would be admissible as conduct u/s.8 quite apart from the admissibility of the disclosure statement u/s.27. [Paras 56(e), 59] Evidence – Positive facts vis-à-vis negative facts – Rules shifting the evidential burden or burden of introducing evidence in proof of one’s case as opposed to the persuasive burden or burden of proof, i.e., of proving all the issues remaining with the prosecution: Held: What lies at the bottom of the various rules shifting the evidential burden or burden of introducing evidence in proof of one’s case as opposed to the persuasive burden or burden of proof, i.e., of proving all the issues remaining with the prosecution and which never shift is the idea that it is impossible for the prosecution to give wholly convincing evidence on certain issues from its own hand and it is, therefore, for the accused to give evidence on them if he wishes to escape – Positive facts must always be proved by the prosecution [2024] 6 S.C.R. 167 Anees v. The State Govt. of NCT – But the same rule cannot always apply to negative facts – It is not for the prosecution to anticipate and eliminate all possible defences or circumstances which may exonerate an accused – When a person does not act with some intention other than that which the character and circumstances of the act suggest, it is not for the prosecution to eliminate all the other possible intentions – If the accused had a different intention that is a fact especially within his knowledge and which he must prove.
