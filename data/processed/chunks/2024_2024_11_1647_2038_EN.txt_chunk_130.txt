However, in to expand the scope of education and to accommodate growing demand, there was a legitimate need to change the role of the university from mere administrative bodies to institutions of learning. Hence, while there was hitherto monopoly exercised by government universities,89 it permitted private players to approach the government and seek the setting up of a university. As recognized by the Saddler Commission, BHU was the first of its kind. 163. In due parlance, the University Commission Report of 1929 also acknowledged this change, and it was noted that various learning universities had come into being.90 In to establish a university whose degree would be recognized by the government, they were required to be established through a statute.91 Universities that were established in native states were also created through the sanction of the ruler.92 Even though some native groups did establish universities 88 M.E.

Supreme Court Reports without the statute, their degrees were not recognized, consequently leading to them being less attractive centres of learning.93 164. That means that while universities were still required to seek a government’s sanction for recognition of degrees, the statutes were limited to their legal existence. There are other essential components as well, to determine the status of a university. As was also briefly explicated in Prof. Yashpal (supra),94 a university in essence, is also an organized body that serves as a centre of higher education by linking students and teachers. For it to exist in that form, it is necessary for someone to ideate, plan, gather the resources, take approvals, and functionalize the institution once the sanction is received.95 This materiality was also briefly alluded to by the University Commission of 1948, when it said that: “The Annamalai University owes its inception to the generosity of the late Annamalai Chettiar of Chettinad. The Banaras and the Aligarh Universities have had large endowments given by princes and commoners. The Calcutta University has had endowments given by such eminent persons as P.C. Ray, Rash Behari Ghose and Tarakanath Palit; while Bombay has had large endowments from the Singhania and Tata Trusts besides endowments from several other philanthropic citizens; the University of Nagpur has had a large endowment under the Laxminarayan Trust, Fund and the Madras University has for the first time been given a generous endowment by Dr. Alagappa Chettiar.
