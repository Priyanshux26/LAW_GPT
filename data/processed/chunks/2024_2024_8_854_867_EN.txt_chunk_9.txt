In view of this, in the facts of the present case, we find that the legitimate expectation was not outweighed by any overriding public interest. 35. The mandate of Ram Pravesh Singh (supra) as reiterated in Sivanandan C.T. (supra) that the appellant was entitled to an acceptable explanation for the denial of the expectation remains unfulfilled. This is an additional ground on which the appellant should succeed. 36. In view of the aforesaid, we set aside the of the learned Single Judge dated 04.12.2019 and of the Division Bench dated 20.06.2022. We also set aside the Resolution in Agenda No.18/32/2018 of the 32nd Meeting of the Executive Council held on 13.12.2018 insofar as it records that the Appellant is not confirmed in service and that the post should be readvertised. We also set [2024] 8 S.C.R. 867 Maitreyee Chakraborty v. The Tripura University & Ors. aside the letter of the Registrar dated 06.02.2019 directing that her services will not be continued beyond 28.02.2019. We further issue a writ of mandamus directing the Respondent-University to place the Appellant’s case for confirmation before the Executive Council and that the Executive Council and the Respondent-University shall pass appropriate resolution/(s), in accordance with the findings given in the present . The said exercise is to be carried out within four weeks’ time. The Appellant should also be given all consequential benefits. 37. The appeal stands allowed in the above terms. There shall be no as to costs. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
