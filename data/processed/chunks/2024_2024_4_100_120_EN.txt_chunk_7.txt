That apart, we find that even though the Division Bench did not come to the conclusion that the finding recorded by the Labour Court on the issue of non-compliance with Section 25-F of the Act is vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record, it allowed the writ petition by assuming that the appellant’s initial engagement/employment was not legal and the respondent had complied with the conditions of a valid retrenchment. 13. In our view, the approach adopted by the Division Bench is contrary to the judicially recognised limitations of the High Court’s power to issue writ of certiorari under Article 226 of the Constitution—Syed [2024] 4 S.C.R. 109 M/S Bharti Airtel Limited v. A.S. Raghavendra Pepsico India Holding (P) Ltd. v Krishna Kant Pandey, (2015) 4 SCC 270. 10. Further, it was submitted that unless a person proves that he is employed to perform any manual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational, clerical, or supervisory work, such person does not fall within the definition of “workman” under Section 2(s), ID Act and that it has been held that a teacher, an advertising manager, a chemist employed in a sugar mill, gate sergeant in a tannery, and a welfare officer in an educational institution are not “workman”, and that a legal assistant, whose job is not stereotyped and involves creativity can never be a “workman”. It was submitted that the High Court has, thus, clearly fallen in error in not appreciating the ratios of s of this Court in Heavy Engineering Corporation v Presiding Officer, Labour Court, (1996) 11 SCC 236; Muir Mills Yakoobv. K.S. Radhakrishnan [AIR 1964 SC 477 : (1964) 5 SCR 64] , Municipal Board, Saharanpur v. Imperial Tobacco of India Ltd. [(1999) 1 SCC 566] , Lakshmi Precision Screws Ltd. v. Ram Bahagat [(2002) 6 SCC 552 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 926] , Mohd. Shahnawaz Akhtar v. ADJ, Varanasi [(2010) 5 SCC 510 : JT (2002) 8 SC 69] , Mukand Ltd. v. Staff and Officers’ Assn. [(2004) 10 SCC 460 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 798] , Dharamraj v. Chhitan [(2006) 12 SCC 349 : (2006) 11 Scale 292] and CIT v. Saurashtra Kutch Stock Exchange Ltd. [(2008) 14 SCC 171 : (2008) 12 Scale 582] 14. In Syed Yakoob v. K.S. Radhakrishnan [AIR 1964 SC 477: (1964) 5 SCR 64] the Constitution Bench of this Court considered the scope of the High Court’s jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari in cases involving challenge to the s passed by the authorities entrusted with quasi-judicial functions under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. Speaking for the majority of the Constitution Bench, Gajendragadkar, J. observed as under: (AIR pp. 479-80, para 7) “7. … A writ of certiorari can be issued for correcting errors of jurisdiction committed by inferior courts or tribunals; these are cases where s are passed by inferior courts or tribunals without jurisdiction, or is in excess of it, or as a result of failure to exercise jurisdiction. A writ can similarly be issued where in exercise of jurisdiction conferred on it, the court or tribunal acts illegally or improperly, as for instance, it decides a question without giving an opportunity to be heard to the party affected by the , or where the procedure adopted in dealing with the dispute is opposed to principles of natural justice.
