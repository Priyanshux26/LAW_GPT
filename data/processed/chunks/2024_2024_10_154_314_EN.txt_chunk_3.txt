Interpretation of Statutes – Information Technology Act, 2000 – Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 – ss.67, 67A vis-à-vis s.67B – Purposive interpretation: [2024] 10 S.C.R. 159 Just Rights for Children Alliance & Anr. v. S. Harish & Ors. Held: A conjoint reading of Section(s) 67 and 67A vis-a-vis 67B would reveal that unlike the former which penalizes only the publication or transmission of any obscene material or pornographic material,scope and ambit of Section 67B is much wider as it recognizes and penalizes five different forms/categories of actus reus – s.67B not only punishes the electronic dissemination of child pornographic material, but also the creation, possession, propagation and consumption of such material as well as the different types of direct and indirect acts of online sexual denigration and exploitation of the children – ss.67, 67A, s.67B being a complete code, ought to be interpreted in a purposive manner that suppresses the mischief and advances the remedy and ensures that the legislative intent of penalizing the various forms of cyber- offences relating to children and the use of obscene/pornographic material through electronic means is not defeated by a narrow construction.
