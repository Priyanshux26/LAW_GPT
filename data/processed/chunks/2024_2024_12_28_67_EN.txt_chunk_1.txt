[Paras 18, 30, 42(3)] Service Law – Recruitment – Whether recruiting bodies can devise an appropriate procedure for concluding recruiting process: Held: Recruiting bodies, subject to the extant Rules, may devise appropriate procedure for bringing the recruitment process to its logical end provided the procedure so adopted is transparent, non-discriminatory/non-arbitrary and has a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved. [Para 42(4)] 30 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Service Law – Recruitment – Whether the procedure prescribed in the Extant Rule can be violated: Held: Procedure prescribed in the Extant Rule cannot be violated – Extant Rules having statutory force are binding on the recruiting body both in terms of procedure and eligibility – Where there are no Rules or the Rules are silent on the subject, administrative instructions may be issued to supplement and fill in the gaps in the Rules – In that event administrative instructions would govern the field provided they are not ultra vires the provisions of the Rules or the Statute or the Constitution – But where the Rules expressly or impliedly cover the field, the recruiting body would have to abide by the Rules. [Paras 39, 42(5)] Service Law – Name in select list – Right to appointment – Whether appointment could be denied even after placement in select list: Held: Appointment may be denied even after placement in select list – A candidate placed in the select list gets no indefeasible right to be appointed even if vacancies are available – But there is a caveat – The State or its instrumentality cannot arbitrarily deny appointment to a selected candidate – Therefore, when a challenge is laid to State’s action in respect of denying appointment to a selected candidate, the burden is on the State to justify its decision for not making appointment from the Select List. [Para 40] Service Law – Recruitment – Legitimate Expectation – Discretion of Public Authority – Public Interest: Held: Candidates participating in a recruitment process have legitimate expectation that the process of selection will be fair and non-arbitrary – The basis of doctrine of legitimate expectation in public law is founded on the principles of fairness and non- arbitrariness in government dealings with individuals – However, the doctrine of legitimate expectation does not impede or hinder the power of the public authorities to lay down a policy or withdraw it – The public authority has the discretion to exercise the full range of choices available within its executive power – The public authority often has to take into consideration diverse factors, concerns, and interests before arriving at a particular policy decision – The courts are generally cautious in interfering with a bona fide decision of public authorities which denies legitimate expectation provided such a decision is taken in the larger public interest – Thus, public [2024] 12 S.C.R. 31 Tej Prakash Pathak & Ors. v. Rajasthan High Court & Ors. interest serves as a limitation on the application of the doctrine of legitimate expectation – Courts have to determine whether the public interest is compelling and sufficient to outweigh the legitimate expectation of the claimant.
