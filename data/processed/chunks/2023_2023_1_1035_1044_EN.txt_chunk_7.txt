In a case of “diversification”, the effect has to be that the quality and quantity of the product should have been improved and/or increased but if the ultimate use is the same, the product manufactured on use of modern and/or advanced technology cannot be said to be manufacturing the different goods for claiming the exemption from payment of trade tax. The words C used in Section 4-A are very clear and unambiguous. As per the settled proposition of law and as observed hereinabove, the Statute and more particularly, the exemption provisions are to be read as they are and to be construed literally and should be given a literal meaning. Giving the literal meaning to the exemption provision namely, Section 4-A, it cannot D be said that the appellant is entitled to the exemption as claimed. 8.4 Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and as observed hereinabove, when the provisions of the Act unequivocally provides that the “diversification” can be considered only in a case where “goods of different nature” are produced, and only then the exemption shall be available. The goods manufactured on “diversification” must be E a “different”, “distinct” and a “separate” good in nature. In the present case, the goods manufactured on use of advance and/or modern technology, cannot be said to be a different commercial activity at all. The High Court has not committed any error in refusing to grant exemption to the appellant. We are in complete agreement with the view taken by F the High Court. 9. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, present appeal fails and the same deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed. No costs. G Divya Pandey Appeal dismissed.
