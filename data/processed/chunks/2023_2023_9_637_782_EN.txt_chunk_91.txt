Therefore, the phrase “any dues relating to G that premises” has to be understood with regard to the supply of electricity made to the premises when it was in occupation of the previous owner. 265. We have already clarified that electricity arrears do not automatically become a charge over the premises. A Statutory charge is created only where there is an express provision of law providing for H 758 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A creation of a statutory charge upon the transferee. Clause 4.1.11 does not have the effect of creating a charge on the property as it does not specifically provide for creation of a statutory charge. Besides, the phrase “any dues relating to that premises” cannot be interpreted to impute financial liability on the premises. B 266. Moreover, the High Court has held that the 2003 Act does not enable the Electric Utilities to frame conditions to recover dues of a previous consumer from a subsequent owner or occupier. We disagree with this reasoning of the High Court in view of our analysis in the preceding paragraphs, where we have held that the Electric Utilities can specify the requirement that the subsequent owner or occupier of the C premises has to pay the arrears of electricity dues of the previous consumer as a pre-condition for the grant of an electricity connection. However, such terms and conditions of supply should be valid and reasonable by conforming to the overall scheme and purpose of the 2003 Act. D 267.

In 2003, the Board lodged a claim before the Official Liquidator with decree in the suit for Rs. 78 lakhs and legal expenses and interest up to December 2002, which cumulatively amounted to Rs. 1.39 crores. G 269. On 17 December 2003, the Official Liquidator executed a sale deed in favour of the respondent. The sale deed specifically mentions the liability of the purchaser about the dues. On 25 February 2004, a revised sale deed was registered and executed in favour of the respondent H 98 “RSML” K. C. NINAN v. KERALA STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD & 759 ORS.
