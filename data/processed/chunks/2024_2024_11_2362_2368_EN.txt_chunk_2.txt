The State further alleges that the appellant failed to submit the Work Completion Reports on five occasions. 7. Be that as it may, we have heard learned counsel for the parties and carefully perused the material placed on record. 8. This appears to be a classic case of administrative imperiousness, resulting in the removal of an elected Sarpanch—a young woman dedicated to serving her remote village in Chhattisgarh. Rather than recognizing her commitment and supporting her vigor for the village’s development, the authorities unjustly penalized her for baseless and unwarranted reasons. 2366 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 9. A prima facie examination of the case trajectory reveals a calculated effort by members of the Gram Panchayat, hand in glove with administrative authorities, to obstruct the appellant’s initiatives. These individuals sought to undermine her credibility with unfounded accusations of misconduct and, when these stratagems failed, resorted to sabotaging development projects. This concerted campaign ultimately led to her unjust removal as the duly elected Sarpanch. It is cause for concern that at every step, the appellant faced relentless obstacles and received little to no support in her endeavors. 10. The first instance of hindrance in this appeal can be pinpointed to the Work dated 16.12.2022, which required completion of the project within three months but was served to the appellant only after the stipulated period had elapsed. Subsequently, on 25.05.2023, once the construction work had begun, the Sub-Divisional Officer, Rural Engineering Services, Pharsabahar—who also bore responsibility for overseeing the project—expressed his dissatisfaction over the alleged delay in completing the work under the RIPA scheme, and even went so far as to request that action be taken against the appellant. 11. When proceedings commenced at the District Administration level, not only were the bald allegations against the appellant accepted without scrutiny, but she was also denied the fundamental opportunity to be heard. It is deeply troubling to witness administrative officials misusing their authority and blatantly disregarding well-established principles of natural justice. It is incomprehensible how the Sub- Divisional Officer (Revenue), Pharsabahar, issued the dated 18.01.2024, directing the removal of an elected representative in such a lackadaisical and hasty manner. It is even more so intriguing that a junior official like a Sub-Divisional officer has been empowered to determine the fate of an elected Sarpanch. 12. The administrative authorities, with their colonial mindset, have regrettably failed yet again to recognize the fundamental distinction between an elected public representative and a selected public servant. Invariably, elected representatives like the appellant are often treated as subordinate to bureaucrats compelled to comply with directives that serve to encroach upon their autonomy and impinge their accountability. This misconceived and self-styled supervisory power is asserted with an intention to equate elected representatives [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2367 Sonam Lakra v. State of Chhattisgarh & Ors. with public servants holding civil posts, completely disregarding the democratic legitimacy conferred by election. 13. What further muddies these already murky waters is the selective accountability imposed on the appellant for the alleged delay in completing the development works.
