Based on the fi ndings of the medical boards, the appellant was sent to INHS, Asvini Mumbai, for his further medical classifi cation, and the specialist4 suggested that the appellant should be excused from physically exhaustive activities (including PT, Parade, and standing duties). 8. On 10.09.2015, the appellant requested for the release of certifi ed copies of his medical records. They were not provided to him despite the fact that said records were essential for his treatment post discharge from the service. In fact, the appellant alleges that a condition was insisted on him to sign on the proceedings of a Release Medical Board which allegedly never took place. On 31.05.2016, the appellant was denied extension of services and was discharged from service, without the due proceedings of the Release Medical Board. At the time of release, the appellant was not provided with the Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (hereafter, “ECHS”) card within a reasonable time and an ECHS temporary card was issued only after an application5 was moved by him. Further, Rs. 15,000 were also deducted from the dues owed to him post-retirement in the absence of an ECHS card for undergoing medical treatment. 9. On 22.09.2016, the appellant wrote a letter to obtain his disability certifi cate. That was denied to him by a letter dated 14.12.20166, which stated that no such provision exists for issuance of printed disability certifi cate 3 Letter No RO/3305/3/Med. 4 Opinion of Specialist dated 16.12.2015 5 ApplicaƟ on dated 26.04.2016. 6 Vide Air HQ/99798/1/741570/DAV(DP/RMB).

RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] in the format as desired by the appellant and subsequently on 29.08.2017, the appellant’s disability pension was sanctioned in addition to his service pension. Pertinently, the letter dated 14.12.2016, also mentioned that: “3. Notwithstanding above it is certifi ed that as per records held with this offi ce, the disability “Immune Surveillance (HIV)” got affl icted due the blood transfusion that you received at 171 MH in July 2002. The disability is attributable to service.” 10. Aggrieved by the denial of medical reports as to his blood transfusion, the appellant preferred an RTI application7 requesting for: (i) copies of his willingness certifi cate as to blood transfusion; (ii) information as to whether risks were disclosed to him about blood transfusion and whether appellant consented to those risks; and (iii) copies of blood test report to ascertain blood group and Rh factor test report of that one unit of blood. PIO RTI Cell8 informed the appellant that the information sought by him was exempted under Section 8(1) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (hereafter, “RTI Act”). Dissatisfi ed with the information provided, he appealed to the First Appellate Authority. 11.The Appellate Authority by its 9 rejected the appeal and observed that best eff orts were made by the respondent authorities to trace the appellant’s medical document and even admission and discharge documents were supplied to him whenever available with the respondent. It was further observed by the Appellate Authority that 171 MH is not an authorized military hospital facility and it was established as an ‘adhoc blood bank’ with necessary blood being requisitioned from 166 MH.
