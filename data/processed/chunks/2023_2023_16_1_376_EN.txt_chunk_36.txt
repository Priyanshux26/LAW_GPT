It was only a legislative enactment for the internal governance of the State and subject to the Constitution of India; and d. Had a limited mandate and could not have overridden the provisions of the Indian Constitution qua Jammu and Kashmir. 60. The State Constitution does not establish a republican form of government in its entirety as it was dependent on the real sovereign document i.e., the Constitution of India.127 124 Written Submissions of Mr. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India 125 Written Submissions of Mr. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India 126 Written Submissions of Mr. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India 127 Written Submissions of Mr. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 57 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 61. The Indian Constitution clearly establishes the Union of India as a sovereign democratic republic. The State Constitution neither establishes sovereignty nor does it claim to do so. The Preamble is indicative of this fact.128 62. To become a fundamental document, a Constitution must necessarily include several facets of undisputed sovereignty including the power to acquire new territory [which, in itself include power to “cede” its own territory]. This is absent in the State Constitution as it was already a part of the Indian Constitution under Article 1.129 63. The power of President under Article 370(3) necessarily pre-supposes the repeal of every document which is required to be repealed to ensure that the entire Constitution of India is made applicable to Jammu and Kashmir without any hinderance or legal hurdle. This power necessarily inheres in the President of India under Article 370(3).130 64. There can only be one supreme document known as the Constitution flowing from the power conferred by the people of India. All other enactments [whether known as a constitution or otherwise] are subordinate to the Constitution of India and the body creating such other documents is also subordinate to the Constitution of India.131 65. Article 367 has previously been utilised to modify Article 370. This is a legitimate route to modify Article 370.132 66. When the Reorganisation Act was enacted, the second proviso to Article 3 (which applied to the State of Jammu and Kashmir alone) was not in force. This is because CO 272 issued by the President made the entire Constitution applicable to the State in supersession of any previous Constitutional s. As a result, all the ‘modifications’ of the Constitution were superseded and only the first proviso was 128 Written Submissions of Mr. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India 129 Written Submissions of Mr. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India 130 Written Submissions of Mr. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India 131 SBI v.
