Although the court relied on the object of the impugned statute, it placed equal emphasis on its eff ect. Its reasoning indicates that the eff ect must be of an appreciable or signifi cant degree. 376. This line of precedent was consolidated in Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu,264 where a Constitution Bench of this Court was called 263 1964 SCC OnLine SC 25 264 1992 Supp (2) SCC 651 IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 223 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] upon to determine the constitutional validity of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution. One of the grounds of challenge was that paragraph 7 of the Tenth Schedule brought about a change in the operation of Articles 136, 226 and 227 of the Constitution and that the concerned Bill ought to have been passed in compliance with the procedure laid down by the proviso to clause (2) of Article 368. Paragraph 7 of the Tenth Schedule is extracted below: “7. Bar of jurisdiction of courts. — Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, no court shall have any jurisdiction in respect of any matter connected with the disqualifi cation of a member of a House under this Schedule.” 377. Articles 136, 226 and 227 concern the jurisdiction of this Court and the High Courts respectively and the power of judicial review. Article 136 fi nds a place in Chapter IV of Part V and Articles 226 and 227 are present in Chapter V of Part VI. The proviso to clause (2) of Article 368 stipulates that a constitutional amendment which seeks to make a change to these chapters must be ratifi ed in the manner provided, before the Bill which seeks to make such amendments is presented to the President for assent. The petitioners argued that the Bill inserting the Tenth Schedule attracted the proviso to Article 368(2) because it curtailed the power of judicial review and therefore, ought to have been ratifi ed by the prescribed number of States before it was presented to the President for assent. 378. The majority, speaking through M N Venkatachaliah, J., rejected the challenge to the Tenth Schedule. However, it held that paragraph 7 had the eff ect of changing the application of Articles 136, 226, and 227, thereby attracting the proviso to Article 368(2). It found that paragraph 7 was severable from the other provisions of the Tenth Schedule and struck down paragraph 7 alone. The observations of this Court on the eff ect of paragraph 7 on the provisions which concerned judicial review are instructive and are extracted below: “61. … The changes in Chapter IV of Part V and Chapter V of Part VI envisaged by the proviso need not be direct. The change could be either “in terms of or in eff ect”. It is not necessary to change the language of Articles 136 and 226 of the Constitution to attract the proviso. If in eff ect these articles are rendered ineff ective and made inapplicable 224 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R.
