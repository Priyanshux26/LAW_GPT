Though we are in agreement with the principles laid down in the citations relied on by the learned counsel for the employee, they do not come to rescue the employee as the facts of the same are distinguishable. Thus, we do not find any infirmity or illegality in the of the High Court setting aside the award of the Labour Court which directed reinstatement of the employee along with payment of compensation in lieu of back wages and hence, the same does not call for any interference by us. 18. In the light of the foregoing findings, we set aside the of the High Court confirming the finding of the Labour Court to the extent that the employee was a “workman” within the meaning of section 2(s) of the I.D. Act; and we affirm the same, insofar as setting aside [2024] 10 S.C.R. 2313 Lenin Kumar Ray v. M/s Express Publications (Madurai) Ltd. the award of the Labour Court to reinstate the employee in service and pay compensation of Rs.75,000/- in lieu of back wages. 19. Accordingly, the Appeal filed by the employee stands dismissed and the Appeal filed by the management stands allowed. There is no as to costs. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Civil Appeal No. 11709 of 2024 dismissed. Civil Appeal No. 11710 of 2024 allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Raghav Bhatia, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Liz Mathew, Sr. Adv.)
