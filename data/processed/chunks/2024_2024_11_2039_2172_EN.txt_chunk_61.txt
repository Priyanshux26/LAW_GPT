Clause 6.4.4 is quite ambiguous in 2128 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports its construction regarding the question whether the PBG can be specifically adjusted against the first tranche payment. Although in the Summary of Payments and Security Package, under the column titled “Date of release of security”, the expression “PBG adjusted” exists, yet Clause 6.4.4(a)(i) which furnishes some additional clarity on the Summary of Payments and Security Package provides no mention of the PBG under the heading “Date of release of Security”, while the other two forms of security i.e., the BKC property and Dubai property No.1 are mentioned. The argument of the counsel for the Respondent is that this omission indicates that the PBG would be adjusted under the first tranche payment. However, in our considered opinion irrespective of whether Clause 6.4.4 expressly or impliedly provided for the PBG to be adjusted, such a provision would create a dissonance with Clause 3.13.9 of the RFRP which has also been made binding on the SRA through Clauses 7.3 and 9.4 respectively of the Resolution Plan. Therefore, such an adjustment should not be allowed in the facts of the present case. II. The Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 did not impose conditions which were different from the terms of the Resolution Plan. 112. It is the case of the Appellants that Serial No.11 under Clause 7.7.1 read with Clause 6.1.3(g) evidences that the SRA had to infuse Rs. 350 Crore “in cash” and it was for this reason alone that Para 8(a) of the Lender’s Affidavit required the infusion of Rs. 350 Crore to be done in cash by 31.08.2023. It was submitted that such a requirement for cash payment flowed directly from the Resolution Plan under which an adjustment of the PBG was impermissible and not just out of the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023. This is because the Lender’s Affidavit has not and cannot impose any condition over and above the one laid under the Resolution Plan. 113. On the other hand, the Respondents vehemently submitted that it was only the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 which stipulated the condition that Rs. 350 Crore had to be infused in cash by 31.08.2023, while the Resolution Plan, under Clause 6.4.4 allowed for the payment of Rs. 200 Crore in cash and Rs. 150 Crore through adjusting the PBG. In other words, they argued that the conditions envisaged in the Lender’s Affidavit were different from those stipulated in the Resolution Plan. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2129 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. 114. However, the intent of the legislature is very clear on the aspect that once a Resolution Plan is approved by the Adjudicating Authority i.e., the NCLT, it becomes binding on all the stakeholders involved in the Resolution Plan. Section 31(1) of the IBC, 2016 reads as thus: “31. (1) If the Adjudicating Authority is satisfied that the resolution plan as approved by the committee of creditors under sub-section (4) of section 30 meets the requirements as referred to in sub-section (2) of section 30, it shall by approve the resolution plan which shall be binding on the corporate debtor and its employees, members, creditors,[including the Central Government, any State Government or any local authority to whom a debt in respect of the payment of dues arising under any law for the time being in force, such as authorities to whom statutory dues are owed,] guarantors and other stakeholders involved in the resolution plan.” (emphasis supplied) 115.
