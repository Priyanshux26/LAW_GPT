The Permit System Rules 1949 framed in exercise of the power under the Influx from Pakistan (Control) Act 1949 did not cover those who remigrated from East Pakistan (today’s Bangladesh) to India. It only covered those who remigrated from West Pakistan (today’s Pakistan) to India. Thus, though the proviso to Article 7 does not distinguish between migrants from West Pakistan and East Pakistan, migrants from the latter were unable to secure the benefit of citizenship in the absence of Rules on the implementation of the permit system along the eastern b. Thus, the proviso to Article 7 only covered those who remigrated to India from West Pakistan after 1 March 1947 but before 26 July 1949; and d. Article 6 and the proviso to Article 7 confer citizenship on a limited class upon the commencement of the Constitution: (i) migrants from West Pakistan and East Pakistan till 26 July 1949; and (ii) persons who re-migrated from West Pakistan to India (who had earlier migrated from India to Pakistan after partition) under the permit system till 26 July 1949. 31. As opposed to Articles 6 and 7, Section 6A confers citizenship on those who migrated from Bangladesh to Assam until 24 March 1971. Article 6 and the proviso to Article 7 confer citizenship on a limited class. Section 6A deals with those who are not covered by the constitutional provisions, that is those who migrated (or re-migrated) after 26 July 1949. The provision also covers those who migrated in the period covered by the constitutional provisions but who were not covered by the substantive stipulations in the provisions. For example, Article 6 does not cover a person who migrated from east Pakistan to Assam after 19 July 1948 but did not apply to register as a citizen before the commencement of the Constitution. Section 6A confers citizenship on such persons. There is thus, a certain degree of overlap between Section 6A and [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1259 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 the constitutional provisions. However, that does not amount to an ‘alteration or amendment’ of the constitutional provisions. This is for the simple reason that Article 6 and the proviso to Article 7 confer citizenship on the ‘commencement of the constitution’. That is, they only deal with who shall be citizens on 26 January 1950. In contrast, Section 6A confers citizenship from 1 January 1966 to those who migrated before that date. Those who migrated between 1 January 1966 and 24 March 1971, are conferred citizenship upon the completion of ten years from the date of detection as a foreigner. Thus, Section 6A confers citizenship on a later date to those who are not covered by Articles 6 and 7. Section 6A could be interpreted to alter or amend Articles 6 and 7 only if it conferred citizenship retrospectively, as at the commencement of the Constitution which is not the case. c. The scope of Article 11 of the Constitution 32. Article 11 stipulates that the provisions of Part II shall not ‘derogate’ from the power of Parliament to make any provision with respect to (a) acquisition of citizenship; (b) termination of citizenship; and (c) all other matters relating to citizenship: "11.
