It was urged that this establishes that there was no readiness and willingness to comply with their obligations in terms of the Agreement. 10. Learned counsel submitted that the thumb-impression(s) in the endorsement(s) have neither matched nor been found to be identical as per the fingerprint expert’s report which has been referred to in the of the First Appellate Court. 11. Learned counsel submitted that as per the rendered by the First Appellate Court and affirmed by the High Court, the last payment made and endorsed on 17.09.1991 has been accepted and thus three years from such date would be 16.09.1994 but the suit was instituted only on 23.03.1998, which is clearly barred by limitation. 12. It was submitted that the Trial Court had found that the endorsements were silent regarding extension of time, which finding has not been disturbed either by the First Appellate Court or the High Court and [2024] 1 S.C.R. 379 Alagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr. looking at the issue from such angle, six months’ time under the Agreement would expire on 21.05.1991 and a three-year limitation would end on 22.05.1994. On this, learned counsel submitted that the contention of the respondents that the limitation would start from the rendered in Original Suit No.551 of 1992 dated 24.07.1996, filed by appellant no.1 for seeking possession and eviction of her husband and mother-in-law from the suit property, is not the correct legal perspective, as mere absence of possession would not have defeated the passing of title from the appellants in favour of the respondents by the execution of a Sale Deed. The object of the Agreement was only for conveying the title of the property in question. 13. Learned counsel submitted that neither Original Suit No.551 of 1992 nor the rendered therein have been mentioned by the respondents in Original Suit No.165 of 1998 for computing the cause of action for filing suit in the year 1998 with regard to the Agreement, which was entered into in 1990. Further, it was urged that it was incumbent upon the respondents to have obtained the Sale Deed and possession through Court as set forth in the Default Clause in the Agreement and thus, the Legal Notice dated 18.11.1997 by the respondents would not extend the time as it had expired much before and such unilateral issuance of notice would not get over the legal bar of Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”). 14. Learned counsel summed up arguments by contending that in any view of the matter, prior to filing of the suit, the property in question had already been sold under registered Sale Deed to the appellant no.7 and the suit for specific performance was required to be dismissed as the Sale Deed to appellant no.7 has not been challenged. 15. Learned counsel relied upon the decision of this Court in K.S. Vidyanadam v Vairavan, (1997) 3 SCC 1, at Paragraphs 10, 11 and 13 for the proposition that Courts in India have consistently held that in the case of agreement of sale relating to immovable property, time is not the essence of the contract unless specifically provided to that effect, and the period of limitation prescribed by the Act for filing a suit was 3 years.
