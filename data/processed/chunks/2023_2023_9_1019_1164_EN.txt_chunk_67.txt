of NCT of Delhi [(2006) 5 SCC 702: (2006) 6 Scale 588]. )” B PUNE MUNICIPAL CORPORATION AND ANOTHER V. PROMOTERS AND BUILDERS ASSOCIATION AND ANOTHER45 90. The matter arose under the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act, 1966 (MRTP). The Development Control Rules were C directed to be amended by the Government under Section 37 of the said law. The case of the respondents before this Court was that the matter travelled beyond the powers of the State Government under Section 37(2) of the Act. We notice the following: “5. Making of DCR or amendments thereof are legislative functions. Therefore, Section 37 has to be viewed as repository D of legislative powers for effecting amendments to DCR. That legislative power of amending DCR is delegated to the State Government. As we have already pointed out, the true interpretation of Section 37(2) permits the State Government to make necessary modifications or put conditions while granting E sanction. In Section 37(2), the legislature has not intended to provide for a public hearing before according sanction. The procedure for making such amendment is provided in Section 37. Delegated legislation cannot be questioned for violating the principles of natural justice in its making except when the statute itself provides for that requirement. Where the legislature has not F chosen to provide for any notice or hearing, no one can insist upon it and it is not permissible to read natural justice into such legislative activity. Moreover, a provision for “such inquiry as it may consider necessary” by a subordinate legislating body is generally an enabling provision to facilitate the subordinate G legislating body to obtain relevant information from any source and it is not intended to vest any right in anybody. (Union of India v. Cynamide India Ltd. [(1987) 2 SCC 720] , SCC paras 5 and 27. See generally H.S.S.K. Niyami v. Union of India [(1990) 4 SCC 516] and Canara Bank v. Debasis Das [(2003) 4 SCC H 45 (2004) 10 SCC 796 ASSOCIATION OF VASANTH APARTMENTS’ OWNERS v. 1109 V. GOPINATH & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] 557 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 507] .) While exercising legislative A functions, unless unreasonableness or arbitrariness is pointed out, it is not open for the Court to interfere. (See generally ONGC v. Assn. of Natural Gas Consuming Industries of Gujarat [1990 Supp SCC 397] .) Therefore, the view adopted by the High Court does not appear to be correct. B 6. DCR are framed under Section 158 of the Act. Rules framed under the provisions of a statute form part of the statute. (See General Officer Commanding-in-Chief v. Dr. Subhash Chandra Yadav [(1988) 2 SCC 351 : 1988 SCC (L&S) 542 : (1988) 7 ATC 296] , SCC para 14.) In other words, DCR have C statutory force. It is also a settled position of law that there could be no “promissory estoppel” against a statute. (A.P. Pollution Control Board II v. Prof. M.V. Nayudu [(2001) 2 SCC 62] , SCC para 69, STO v.
