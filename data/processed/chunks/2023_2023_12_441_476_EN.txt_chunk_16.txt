[SANJIV KHANNA, J.] account of variation(s), or any damages for breach have to be concluded by using contract price. “Thickening”, by adding unreasonable expenses, should not be accepted. It is observed that in the total cost method, there is diffi culty in linking cause and eff ect convincingly, albeit is more precise and factually accurate. Thus, Hudson’s method should be taken as the basis for computation with caution and as a last resort, where no other way to compute damages is feasible or mathematically accurate. Inaccuracies in Hudson’s computation should not be overlooked, and should be accounted and neutralized. Hudson’s formula when applied should be with full care and caution not to over-award the damages. 27. Arbitral tribunal in the present case has given complete go by to these principles well in place, overlooked care and caution required and taken a one-sided view grossly and abnormally infl ated the damages. The fi gures quoted in paragraph 11 supra show the over-statement and aggrandizement in awarding Rs. 1,57,37,666/-, towards loss of overheads and loss of profi ts/ profi tability, in a contract of Rs. 5,74,35,213/-. Rs.1,21,95,859.68/- was paid for the work done within the term. Rs. 2,92,07,619.13 was paid for the work done post the term. Thus, Rs. 4,14,03,478.81/- was paid for 80% of the work. The balance was Rs.1,14,87,042.00/. The amount awarded towards loss of overheads and profi ts/profi tability is Rs.1,57,37,666/-. No justifi cation for computation of the loss is elucidated or can be expounded. Even if one were to rely upon the chart given by the BEEL, and ignore the contradictions in fi ndings, the amount awarded is highly disproportionate and exorbitant. It is clearly a case of overlapping or at least a part doubling of the loss/damages. 28. The arbitral tribunal has accepted that principle of mitigation is applicable but observes that the only way BEEL could have abased the loss, was to work on Sundays or holidays. This reasoning is again ex facie fallacious and wrong. The principle of mitigation with regard to overhead expenses does not mandate working on Sundays or holidays. 29. We would like to refer to Claim No.2 for idle machinery and equipment. This was on account of extended period of contract. This claim of more than Rs.84,00,000/- has been accepted for Rs.12,00,000/-, by simply stating that the learned arbitrator had inspected the site and, in his opinion, there is substance in the claim. Inspection of the site was post 466 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R.
