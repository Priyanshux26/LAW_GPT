21. In Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited vs. Governor, State of Orissa,5 this Court was dealing with Section 31(7) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, wherein for the purposes of payment of post-award interest, the phrase ‘sum directed to be paid by award’ 3 [1999] 2 SCR 830 : (1999) 4 SCC 327 4 [2010] 2 SCR 297 : (2010) 3 SCC 690 5 [2014] 14 SCR 1029 : (2015) 2 SCC 189 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 119 M/s D. Khosla and Company v. The Union of India was used and it was held that it includes the pre-award interest and, therefore, post-award interest is payable on the sum awarded which includes pre-award interest. However, a distinction was made between Section 31(7) which simply uses the word ‘sum’ and Section 34 CPC wherein the phrase ‘on principal sum adjudged’ has been used. The departure in the use of the language in the two provisions was held to be of great significance which clearly showed that the term ‘sum’ under Section 31(7) refers to aggregate amount of the award and the pre-award interest whereas ‘principal sum adjudged’ under Section 34 CPC refers only to the amount awarded. 22. The case of UHL Power Company Limited vs. State of Himachal Pradesh,6 is again in relation to interpretation of Section 31(7) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, wherein the principal laid down in Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited (supra) has been accepted. 23. In the light of the above legal provisions and the case law on the subject, it is evident that ordinarily courts are not supposed to grant interest on interest except where it has been specifically provided under the statute or where there is specific stipulation to that effect under the terms and conditions of the contract. There is no dispute as to the power of the courts to award interest on interest or compound interest in a given case subject to the power conferred under the statutes or under the terms and conditions of the contract but where no such power is conferred ordinarily, the courts do not award interest on interest. 24. Neither the Act specifically empowers the Arbitrator or the court to award interest upon interest or compound interest nor there is any other provision which provides for grant of compound interest or interest upon interest. Even Section 34 CPC is silent in this regard whereas Sub-Section (3) of Section 3 of the Interest Act specifically prohibits the same. 25. In view of the above legal position, we have to examine the award in question and the decree drawn in pursuance thereof to find out if compound interest or interest upon interest has been awarded. 26. The relevant part of the award pertaining to the interest and that of the decree has been reproduced hereinbefore. 6 [2022] 1 SCR 1 : (2022) 4 SCC 116 120 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 27. A plain reading of the aforesaid award and decree reveals that interest awarded under the award has been dissected into two parts.
