ii. Equality applies at the stage of appointment of arbitrators 67. Section 18 contains the principle of natural justice to give full opportunity to parties to present their case.121 In Union of India v. Vedanta Ltd., Justice Indu Malhotra, writing for a three Judge Bench, observed that the “[f]air and equal treatment of the parties is a non- derogable and mandatory provision, on which the entire edifice of the alternate dispute resolution mechanism is based.”122 The purpose of Section 18 is to give the arbitral process a semblance of judicial proceedings by infusing the principles of equality and fairness.123 The theoretical basis for this understanding stems from the fact that arbitrators are authorities vested with powers to resolve disputes under the law.124 68. The first part of Section 18 provides that “parties shall be treated with equality.” The broad nature of the prescription has to be complied with not only by arbitral tribunals, but also by parties while giving expression to party autonomy. The principle has to be followed in all procedural contexts of arbitral proceedings, including the stage 119 Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration (7th edition, 2022) 3 120 Siemens Engg. (supra) [6]. [6. […] If courts of law are to be replaced by administrative authorities and tribunals, as indeed, in some kinds of cases, with the proliferation of Administrative Law, they may have to be so replaced, it is essential that administrative authorities and tribunals should accord fair and proper hearing to the persons sought to be affected by their s and give sufficiently clear and explicit reasons in support of the s made by them. Then alone administrative authorities and tribunals exercising quasi-judicial function will be able to justify their existence and carry credibility with the people by inspiring confidence in the adjudicatory process. The rule requiring reasons to be given in support of an is, like the principle of audi alteram partem, a basic principle of natural justice which must inform every quasi-judicial process and this rule must be observed in its proper spirit and mere pretence of compliance with it would not satisfy the requirement of law.] 121 Associate Builders v.

M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company of appointment of arbitrators.125 According to Peter Binder, the principle of equal treatment of parties “means that no party may be given preference in the arbitrator-selection process regardless of how strong its bargaining power may be.”126 Countries such as Germany,127 the Netherlands,128 Spain,129 and Estonia130 allow the party that has been disadvantaged by an asymmetric appointment clause to request courts to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators. The underlying principle is that the courts should not recognise and enforce agreements that are unfair and biased.
