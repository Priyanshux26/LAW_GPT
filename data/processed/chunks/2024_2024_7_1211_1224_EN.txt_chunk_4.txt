Sections 138, 143A, and 148 of the NI Act fall under Chapter XVII, which pertains to penalties for the dishonour of certain cheques due to insufficient funds. A plain reading of Section 138 highlights that the drawer must have an account with sufficient funds to cover the cheque. The primary liability under Section 138 is on the drawer, who must ensure that there are adequate funds in the account at the time the cheque is presented. Additionally, the offence under Section 138 is not complete until a demand notice is served on the drawer, emphasizing the drawer’s responsibility. The drawer is considered the principal offender if the cheque is returned unpaid, subject to the fulfilment of the necessary conditions before and after the cheque is dishonoured. 15.2. General Rule of Criminal Liability The High Court noted the general rule against vicarious liability in criminal cases, where individuals are typically not held criminally liable for acts committed by others. However, this principle is subject to exceptions created by specific statutory provisions extending liability to additional parties. Section 141, NI Act is one such provision that extends criminal liability for dishonour of a cheque committed by a company to its officers. The Court emphasized that liability under Section 141 arises from the conduct, act, or omission of the person involved, not merely their position in the company. The provision establishes vicarious liability for officers of the company, such as signatories of the cheque, managing directors, or those in charge of its affairs, by legal fiction. Thus, while the drawer of the cheque remains primarily liable, Section 141 broadens liability to include others associated with the company’s management, ensuring accountability beyond the drawer alone. 15.3. Authorised signatory cannot be equated to the company Further, the High Court delved into the distinction between legal entities and individuals acting as authorized signatories within the framework of the NI Act. The Court observed that while individuals may sign cheques as authorized representatives of companies, they do not assume legal identity of the company itself. It clarified that a 1218 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports legal entity, such as a corporation or company, is an artificial creation of the law endowed with rights, duties, and the capacity to sue and be sued independently of the individuals who manage or represent it. The Court emphasized that an authorized signatory, despite acting on behalf of a company, remains distinct as an individual under the law. This distinction is crucial as it clarifies that the actions and obligations undertaken by an authorized signatory are attributable to the company they represent, but do not merge their legal status with that of the company itself. Thus, while an authorized signatory may bind the company through their actions, they do not transform into a legal entity in the eyes of law. 15.4. Interpretation of the Section 143-A and the legislative intent Moreover, the High Court highlighted the principle of statutory interpretation, particularly in relation to Sections 143A and 148 of the NI Act, which are under consideration.
