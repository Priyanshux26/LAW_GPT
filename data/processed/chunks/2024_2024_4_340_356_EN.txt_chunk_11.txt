18. We also do not agree with the appellant that stamp duty paid before the amendment cannot be taken into account. It is true that the amendment does not have retrospective effect, however since the instrument ‘Articles of Association’ remains the same and the increase was initiated by the respondent after the cap was introduced, the duty already paid on the same very instrument will have to be considered. It is not a fresh instrument which has been brought to be stamped, but only the increase in share capital in the original document, which has been specifically made chargeable by the Legislation. 19. For the reasons stated above, we dismiss this civil appeal and uphold the of the High Court of Bombay. Accordingly, we direct the appellants to refund Rs. 25 lakhs paid by the respondent along with interest @ 6% per annum. Let the needful be done within 6 weeks from today. 20. Interim (s) shall stand vacated. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey Result of the case: Appeal dismissed.
