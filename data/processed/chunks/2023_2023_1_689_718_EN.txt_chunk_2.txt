By virtue of the amendment, the Legislature thus proposed to make those assessees who are filing the return under Section 158BC also liable to pay tax and interest under Section 140A. The memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill further makes it clear that the existing provisions of F Section 140A were not applicable to Chapter XIV-B relating to assessment of income of the block period in search and seizure cases. It further recognizes that the admitted tax declared in the return cannot be collected till the assessment is completed. Therefore, the Legislature intended to amend Section 140A by G incorporating Section 158BC so as to make liable those persons who are filing return under Section 158BC also. Thus, by virtue of the amendment, a new class of assessee was brought onto the statute-book whose income are subject to be assessed under Chapter XIV-B, in section 140A compelling them to pay self-assessment tax. Thus, the interest under Section 158BFA is H 692 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A leviable on standalone basis for late or non-filing of return, which ceases on the day return is filed. In the impugned and , the High Court has elaborately and comprehensively explained the rationale behind introduction of Section 158BC in Section 140A and has specifically observed and held that the liability of payment of interest does not stop merely on filing of B the return but is attracted in terms of Section 140A till payment of tax in terms of the section and even now the provisions of Section 158BFA(1) and Section 140A operate independently. The view taken by the High Court is concurred with. [Para 10.3][715- C-H] C 2.4 The submission on behalf of the assessee that in absence of any notice under Section 158BC served upon the concerned assessee and in view of insertion of the words “Section 158BC” in Section 158BD inserted vide Finance Act, 2002, there shall not be any liability to pay interest under Section 158BFA is D concerned, the aforesaid submission is absolutely erroneous and has no substance. Prior to amendment in Section 158BD vide Finance Act, 2002 and even thereafter, the provisions of Section 158BC would be applicable in case of “searched persons”. Section 158BD would be applicable in case of persons “other than searched persons”. Therefore, in case of a person “other than E searched person”, no notice under Section 158BC which is required to be issued in case of “searched persons” was required to be issued. For a person “other than searched person”, notice under Section 158BD is sufficient. [Para 10.4][716-A-C] 2.5 The submission on behalf of the assessee that the words F “under Section 158BC” has been inserted in Section 158BD vide Finance Act, 2002 and therefore, in absence of any notice under Section 158BC prior to the amendment, there shall not be any liability to pay interest under Section 158BFA is concerned, a perusal of the Notes on Clauses appended to Clause 64 of the G Finance Bill, 2002, it appears that the same is clarificatory in nature.
