What prompted NOIDA to accept the Demand Draft in the first instance, and then retain the same even after cancelling the allotment has not been explained. What is also hard to comprehend is why it took NOIDA two years to cancel the allotment, once, admittedly, it was in the know of the death of the appellant’s father since at least 10.11.2009. Had the cancellation followed in close proximity to 10.11.2009 or had NOIDA refused to accept the Demand Draft or returned it soon thereafter, the fate of this case could have taken a different turn. 11. On the first day of listing of the writ petition, the High Court on 13.12.2011 had directed NOIDA not to allot the plot in question in anybody else’s favour. This continued during the pendency of the writ proceedings. Before this Court, on the first day of hearing i.e., 02.06.2020, the parties had been directed to maintain status quo as on the said date. In the wake of the sequence of events, as has played out, and on an overall circumspection, the appellant has made out a case for the Court’s intervention. 12. For the reasons aforesaid, NOIDA is directed to issue fresh allotment letter within four weeks from today in the name of the appellant on the same terms and conditions as was mentioned in the original letter of allotment dated 26.10.2009 with the modification that the time-limit would run from today. 13. The Impugned is set aside; the appeal is allowed accordingly. 14. I.A.s No. 42353/2020 and 42349/2020 are allowed. I.A. No. 42504/2020 is disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
