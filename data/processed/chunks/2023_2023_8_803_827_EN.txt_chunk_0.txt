[2023] 8 S.C.R. 803 803 UNION OF INDIA & ORS. A v. M/S. BHARAT ENTERPRISE (Civil Appeal Nos. 3441-3442 of 2015) MARCH 23, 2023 B [K. M. JOSEPH, KRISHNA MURARI AND B. V. NAGARATHNA, JJ.] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – Arbitrator passed an award allowing claims which were submitted after the submission C of the final bill (containing No Claims Certificate) by the Respondent-Contractor – During the arbitration, the appellant filed an application u/s.16 invoking clauses 65 and 65A of the Contract which interdicted the submission of a new claim after the submission of the final bill – Application rejected – Petition filed by the appellant u/s.34 challenging the award, allowed – set aside D by High Court in appeal u/s.37 – Held: When a contractor seeks to wriggle out of a final bill or a ‘no claims due certificate’ which he has submitted, he must establish a case that a final bill or a certificate of no further claims was the result of any of the vitiating factors under the law – Sans such finding, the final bill would stand E – If the final bill cannot be overridden by any factors known to law then the clauses relied upon by the appellants in this case would operate – There was no finding by the Arbitrator that the final bill and the no claims certificate were vitiated – The clauses in the contract were binding not only on the parties but also on the Arbitrator – Going against the terms of clauses 65 and 65A would F indeed render the Award illegal being contrary to the contract and, therefore, without jurisdiction – If the clauses operate, the inevitable result is the arbitrator could not have traveled outside of the contractual prohibition and passed an award allowing claims submitted after the submission of the final bill – While, the reasoning G adopted by the High Court cannot be subscribed to, it cannot also be lost sight of that the amounts in question are fairly meagre and the final bill was settled only after long delay of over an year – It was apparently the long delay in the payment of the final bill amount which led to the raising of the new claims – Perhaps, if the final bill itself was not kept pending for such a long time, the entire dispute H 803 804 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R.
