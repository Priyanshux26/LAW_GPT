Digital Supreme Court Reports 95. In Jagdev Singh Sidhanti v. Pratap Singh Daulta,159 the question before the Constitution Bench was whether appeals made to the electorate to vote or refrain from voting on account of language constitute a corrupt practice under Section 123(3) of the Representation of the People Act 1951.160 The Constitution Bench held that the issue of whether any person was guilty of the corrupt practice under Section 123(3) must be determined in the backdrop of Article 29(1) of the Constitution. In this context, Justice JC Shah writing for the Bench observed that the right to conserve language includes the right to agitate for the protection of language and that political agitation for that purpose cannot be regarded as a corrupt practice. 96. Article 29(1) confers the right to take steps (through positive action) for the preservation of culture, language and script. The phrase ‘conserve’ in the provision denotes positive action taken towards a specific end.161 The provision protects those steps that have a nexus with the end of preservation of culture. There is sound reason to provide a constitutional guarantee to conserve culture, language or script. It is a constitutional recognition of the fact that culture, language and script die a natural death if positive steps are not taken to promote and protect them.162 This is particularly true in a multi-cultural and multi-linguistic country such as India. 97. The second principle is that a law or an executive action is unconstitutional to the extent that it prevents a section from taking steps to preserve their culture. At this juncture, it must be noted that it is now settled that the fundamental rights include both negative and positive rights. The negative right flowing from Article 29(1) prevents the State from interfering with the right of the section of citizens to conserve their culture. The Courts must adopt the well-established effects standard to test if the action of the State is violative of Article 29(1). The positive right flowing from Article 29(1) casts a Constitution Bench held that imposing mother tongue as the medium of instruction in students infringes upon Article 30(1) read with Article 29(1) 159 [1964] 6 SCR 750 160 “The appeal by a candidate […] to vote or refrain from voting for any person on the ground of religion, race, caste, community or language […]” 161 Oxford Dictionary defines the phrase as “to protect something and prevent it from being changed or destroyed”. 162 AIR 1950 SC 27 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1295 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 duty on the State to create conditions for the exercise of the right to conserve culture.163 98. In Jagdev Singh Sidhanti (supra), this Court also observed that the right guaranteed by Article 29(1) is absolute.164 It is true that Article 29(1), unlike Article 19 of the Constitution, does not prescribe grounds for the reasonable restrictions of the right. It must be noted that the decision in Jagdev Singh Sindhanti (supra) was rendered in 1964 when the opinion of this Court in AK Gopalan v. State of Madras165 held the field on the interpretation of fundamental rights.
