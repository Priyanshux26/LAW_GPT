Reply, if any, be fi led within two weeks thereof. Post the matter after six weeks.” 25. In response to the , neither the State Government nor SLAO submitted any explanation. It is only NIT who fi led an additional affi davit on 25.01.2014, inter-alia, stating that allotment of alternate plots in the adjoining area is not possible and denied the payment of compensation as per market value as existing on 03.07.2013. It was stated that it is only the appellant who can be blamed for inordinate delay. In the said affi davit, the causes of delay were crystallized in three slots, viz. between the issuance of notifi cations till fi ling of writ petition; delay during the pendency of writ petition; and delay between the date of in the writ petition and passing the award. On fi ling the said explanation and upon hearing the parties on 22.07.2014, this Court passed the following – “Heard Mr. Shekhar Naphade learned senior counsel and Mr. Gagan Sanghi, learned counsel for the petitioner. Mr. Marlapalle learned senior counsel for Respondent No. 1 and Mr. Pallav Shishodia, learned senior counsel for Respondent No. 2 in part. LOONKARAN GANDHI (D) THR. LR. v. STATE OF 175 MAHARASHTRA AND ORS.[J. K. MAHESHWARI, J.] The learned counsel for the parties shall fi le respective charts precisely putting forth why there was enormous delay in passing the award. We have asked learned counsel for the parties to undertake this exercise as we are of considered opinion that the compensation that is allowable under Section 48-A of the Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936 may be applicable if a case is made out. List on 5th August, 2014.” 26. In furtherance to the said , it is only the appellant who fi led the chart and explained as to how and in what manner, the delay is caused. It was further stated that only respondents are responsible for not passing the award despite time bound directions given by the High Court. Conversely, the SLAO passed an ex-parte award that too without any intimation or notice as mandated by Section 12(2) of LA Act. 27. After hearing the parties and upon perusal of the averments made in the additional affi davits fi led in furtherance of s dated 03.07.2013, 21.10.2013 and 22.07.2014, it is clear that Respondents have taken more than six and half years to issue fi nal notifi cation which was published on 16.01.1969. The possession had been taken immediately and the three notices under Section 9 of LA Act were issued on 18.7.1974, 07.09.1974 and 18.10.1977 respectively. The award was passed in the case of other land owners on 22.09.1986, leaving the case of land owner/appellant herein. Thus, it is apparent that the period of seven years has been taken to issue the notice under Section 9 to the appellant after the date of taking the possession and the award was passed in the case of other land owners after more than 17 years, separating the claim of the appellant.
