In popular sense when one talks of glass ware such specialised articles like clinical syringes, thermometers, lactometers and the like do not come up to one’s mind. Applying the aforesaid test, therefore, we are clearly of the view that the clinical syringes which the assessee manufactures and sells cannot be considered as “glass ware” falling within Entry 39 of the First Schedule of the Act.” 29. In the aforesaid background, we are of the considered view that neither the dictionary meaning nor the common parlance theory would come to the rescue of the appellant. The arguments canvassed by the learned senior counsel with regard to fl at transparent sheet glass as indicated in the Indian Standards Specifi cation has also received the attention of the High Court and has been dealt with under the impugned and distinguished it on facts in favour of the revenue, and rightly so, for the reasons indicated thereunder which we are of the considered view is in tune with the settled principles of law noted hereinabove and thereby impugned does not call for our interference. 30. There is no vagueness in the notifi cation dated 07.09.1981 and the entry No. 4 is clear and unambiguous namely it has brought within the sweep “all goods and wares made of glass” exigible to tax but not including “plain glass panes” and the exemption being the creation of the statute itself, it has to be construed strictly and even if there is any vagueness in the exemption clause must go to the benefi t of the revenue. [(2018) 9 SCC 1 paras 36 to 38] 111 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 31. For the reasons indicated hereinabove, we are of the considered view that the impugned s would not call for interference and accordingly the appeals are dismissed. The notice for reassessment dated 08.02.2001 issued in Civil Appeal No.5914 of 2023 (Special Leave Petition(c) No.29516 of 2013) for the assessment years 1992-93 to 1996-97 is upheld. No as to costs.
