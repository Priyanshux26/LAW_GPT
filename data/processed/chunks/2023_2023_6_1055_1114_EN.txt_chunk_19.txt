7, it can be said that “Niranaram” and “Narayan” is one and the same person. There is nothing on record to D show that, “Chetanram” had another son by name “Narayan”. Even the certificate (document at serial no. 7), is not considered, there is sufficient material on record to indicate that, the school documents and the documents issued by the Tahasildar and the Pariwar Card are genuine and valid. These documents make it clear that, “Niranaram” is brother E of “Anadaram”. Hence, both are siblings. There is nothing to show that, any other person by name “Niranaram Chetanram” was found at village Jalabsar. Therefore, from the documents on record, the document at serial no. 7 can also be believed. Though, none of the documents mention the name “Narayan’’, F the name “Niranaram” has to be said to be another name of “Narayan”. 53) Though, not for exclusively basing the decision, but for the general observation in ordinary sense, it can be said that, people in Rajasthan may be accustomed to pronounce G “Niranaram” easily, but the people in the state of Maharashtra, especially in Pune, may find it difficult to pronounce “Niranaram”. For such reason, there is possibility of the pronunciation mistake to call “Niranaram” as “Narayan” in Pune. H 1082 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 54) If “Niranaram” is not “Narayan” and “Narayan” is some other person, then the State should have brought clear documentary evidence of school record of “Narayan” showing him to be different person. There is no such record. As such, the police record of the Sessions Case may have shown the name “Narayan” without asking for any B identification documents as to his name, in the school record. There is not a single document filed by state to show that the name of “Narayan’s” father is not “Chetanram” but its different. 55) In view of the documents of school and the documents C issued by the Tahasildar, the date of birth of the petitioner appear to be 01/02/1982. As such, on 24/08/1994 his age would be around 12 years and 6 months. If the Pariwar Card, which was issued in the year 1989 is seen, the age mentioned therein is 12 years. If it is the age mentioned for the year D 1989, then in the year 1994, more particularly on 24/08/1994, the age of the petitioner would be 16 years and 8 months. Thus, it is still below 18 years. 56) When the school record is available, ossification test cannot be considered. However, even if the document at serial E no.11 is taken into account, the range mentioned is 22 years to 40 years in the year 2005. Thus, for the year 1994 the range would come to 11 years to 29 years. This also supports the certificates, more particularly the documents at serial nos.1 to 5, 8 and 9. In view of the above observations, it is abundantly clear that, on the date of incident i.e. on 24/08/ F 1994 the age of the petitioner was around 12 years and 6 months.
