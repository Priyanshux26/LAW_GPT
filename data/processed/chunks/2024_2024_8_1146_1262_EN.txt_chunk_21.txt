The appellants have pleaded that KPCL could not have started using the rejects immediately upon receiving approval of the revised Mining Plan and that the rejects having optimum useful heat value/GCV i.e. 2500 Kcal/ kg, could have been used only by applying the FBC technology after such a facility was set up. 27 In short ‘CIMFR’ 28 In short ‘IBOCM’ 29 For short FBC. 1188 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 3.6.2 Vide letter dated 24th August, 2011, the MoC approved the revised Mining Plan submitted by KECML whereafter the process of obtaining preliminary approvals including environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India30 for the enhanced capacity of 5 MTPA coal from 2.5 MTPA was initiated. While the Terms of Reference was granted by the MoEF&CC, the mandatory public hearing required to obtain environment clearance could not be conducted since this Court passed an in the year 2014 deallocating all captive coal blocks. Before that, due to disputes that had arisen between KECML and GCWL, washing of coal was stopped at the washery of GCWL w.e.f. 22nd May, 2012. 3.7 INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY KECML TO THE COAL CONTROLLER 3.7.1 On 14th December, 2012, the Office of the Coal Controller that falls under the MoC called upon the KECML to furnish details in terms of the prescribed formats in respect of the production, stock, despatch of coal to the washery etc. Vide letter dated 16th January, 2013, KECML furnished the detailed data as per the prescribed format. The said letter stated that from December, 2008 to December, 2012, approximately 3,61,000 MT of rejects was generated at the washery; that the ash content of the raw coal varied from 35 per cent to 37 per cent and the content of the washed coal varied from 32 per cent to 34 per cent; that the yield of the washery was about 95 per cent to 96 per cent and the residual 4 per cent of the raw coal were rejects whose ash content was over 90 per cent and was therefore not marketable. It was further stated that the quality of the rejects was so poor that no records were maintained regarding its utilization. However, the rejects were used to fill up low land area of siding and road between coal blocks to the washery and for pit dumping near the washery. 30 In short ‘MoEF&CC’ [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1189 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation 3.7.2 To substantiate the statement made that the yield of the washery was 95 to 96 per cent, the appellants relied on the Washability Report prepared by CIMFR, Nagpur unit dated 01st August, 2009 which records that IBOCM coal is amenable to wash with yield varying from 90 to 98 per cent at the desired ash level of 32 per cent. The Report has recorded that the GCV of the mined coal fit for transporting to BPTS is 4464 Kcal/kg and that of the rejects is 1094 Kcal/kg.
