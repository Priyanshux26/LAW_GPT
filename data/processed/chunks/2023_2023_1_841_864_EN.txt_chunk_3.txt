The Dehati Nalishi further proceeded to state that when he along with the other deceasedKishori Kachi and the eye witness P.W.12, Hakim Singh, went out to attend the nature’s call, the accused persons armed with weapons, including truncheon and axe, attacked them indiscriminately. In pursuance of the said common C objective, all three of them were taken by the attackers to their place, as witnessed by their family members and relatives. This was done despite the request made by one Bhogiram and Bhaggo Bai, P.W.18. They were also attacked, but Bhogiram was dumped on the way. The family members of the deceased Hukum Singh, inclusive of his daughters-in- D law, daughters, Bacchu (P.W.13) and Sirnam Kachi were not present at the place of occurrence, during the time of the offence.
