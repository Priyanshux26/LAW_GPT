ANALYSIS 7. We have heard learned senior counsel for the parties and perused the impugned as well as the other materials on record. 8. An analysis of the enactments governing the dispute would be of profit. 9. The 1910 Act came into force w.e.f. 01st January, 1911, with the objective of amending the law relating to supply and use of electrical energy. The 1948 Act, however, was enacted with the purpose of facilitating the establishment of regional co-ordination in the development of electricity, or as the long title of the said Act states, “to provide for the rationalisation of the production and supply of electricity, and generally for taking measures conducive to electrical development”. Thus, both these enactments had their own spheres of application, and existed concurrently. However, w.e.f. 10th June, 2003, the 2003 Act came into force to “consolidate the laws relating to generation, transmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity and generally for taking measures conducive to development of electricity industry, promoting competition therein, protecting interest of consumers and supply of electricity to all areas, rationalisation of electricity tariff, ensuring transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of efficient and environmentally benign policies, constitution of Central Electricity Authority, Regulatory Commissions and establishment of Appellate Tribunal and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto”.21 The 2003 Act, by virtue of section 185(1), repealed, inter alia, the 1910 Act and the 1948 Act. The 1948 Act, since it related primarily to the statutory powers of the central electricity authority, state electricity authorities and generating companies, would be of minimal relevance while deciding the present dispute. 21 Long title of 2003 Act 352 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 10. We shall first answer the issue of applicability of section 56(2) of the 2003 Act raised by the appellants, which was the turning point of the decision of the Division Bench, i.e., whether the limitation period of two (2) years prescribed by section 56(2) of the 2003 Act bars the appellants from raising demand for the period between June 1996 and May 2000. Though the Division Bench answered this question in the affirmative, in light of two subsequent contrary decisions rendered by this Court precisely on the point, this finding is rendered indefensible and would necessarily have to be set aside. 11. In Kusumam Hotels (P) Ltd. v. Kerala SEB,22 this Court, while examining the issue of retrospective discontinuance of tariff concessions for the tourism industry, held that the liability accruing to the licensee being statutory in nature would continue to survive even after the enforcement of the 2003 Act in the following terms: “43. Whereas the bills are issued only in respect of the dues arising in terms of the law as was applicable prior to the coming into force of the 2003 Act, sub-section (2) of Section 56 shall apply after the said Act came into force. The Board could have even framed a tariff in terms of the provisions appended to Section 61 of the Act. The appellants incurred liability to pay the bill.
