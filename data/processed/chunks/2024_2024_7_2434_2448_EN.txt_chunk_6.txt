Paragraph-2 states that defendants without consent of plaintiff have constructed a veterinary hospital illegally and 11 [2020] 1 SCR 694 : (2020) 11 SCC 242 12 [1976] Supp. 1 SCR 519 : AIR 1976 SC 1485 13 [2020] 8 SCR 912 : (2020) 10 SCC 654 14 [2012] 1 SCR 1045 : (2012) 3 SCC 563 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2443 The State of Punjab and Ors. v. Bhagwantpal Singh Alias Bhagwant Singh (Deceased) Through Lrs. unauthorizedly over the suit land. Paragraph-3 states that the defendants neither purchased the said land from the plaintiff nor paid any compensation to the plaintiff, as such, their possession is unauthorized and illegal. The plaintiff being its owner is entitled to vacant possession. Paragraph 4 states that despite repeated request to hand over vacant possession by removing the debris (malba), no heed has been paid to the said request. Paragraph-5 mentions that a registered notice dated 09.11.2000 was served upon the defendants calling upon them to hand over possession, but no reply was received in response to the same. Copy of the notice and acknowledgement of receipt were attached with the plaint. Paragraph-6 states that cause of action arose on 1st March, 2001 as the defendants did not give any reply to the notice. Paragraph-7 states that suit property was situated within the jurisdiction of the Court. Paragraph-8 mentions regarding the valuation and the court fee paid. Paragraph-9 mentions that there was no prior litigation pending between the parties regarding the subject matter. Paragraph-10 is the relief clause wherein it was prayed that suit of plaintiff for possession of the suit property be decreed. 16. The plaint, to our opinion ought to have been rejected on the ground of being vague and not carrying necessary and material particulars. The plaintiff very conveniently avoided stating in the plaint as to when the defendants constructed the Veterinary Hospital; they also did not mention any details of the period when request was said to have been made for delivering vacant possession; the first date and document mentioned in the plaint is of the legal notice dated 09.11.2000. 17. In the case of Ram Singh Vs. Gram Panchayat Mehal Kalan,15 this Court observed and held that when the suit is barred by any law, the plaintiff cannot be allowed to circumvent that provision by means of clever drafting so as to avoid mention of those circumstances, by which the suit is barred by law of limitation. 18. Herein, it is evident that the plaintiff purposely drafted/filed a vague plaint which lacked the essential details of when the hospital was constructed, when the plaintiff became aware of such construction, 15 (1986) 4 SCC 364 2444 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports when the right of ownership devolved upon the plaintiff, when his father passed away, his letter of 24.04.1981 to the Tehsildar etc. It is nothing but a clear attempt by Respondent at surpassing the bar under limitation law for filing the suit since the existence of the hospital was a fact well known to him since long ago.
