xxx 34. After giving our anxious consideration to the matter and in the light of the law settled by this Court, we have no hesitation in holding that in to claim minority/linguistic status for an institution in any State, the authorities must be satisfied firstly that the institution has been established by the persons who are minority in such State; and, secondly, the right of administration of the said minority linguistic institution is also vested in those persons who are minority in such State. The right conferred by Article 30 of the Constitution cannot be interpreted as if irrespective of the persons who established the institution in the State for the benefit of persons who are minority, any person, be it non-minority in other place, can administer and run such institution.” 1968 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 135. The aforementioned legal position illustrates that this Court has consistently embraced an approach which mandates the initial establishment of an institution as a minority institution by the minority community to assert minority status. This established legal principle has attained the status of stare decisis, which is a fundamental pillar of our legal framework.4 The doctrine of precedent serves to promote certainty, stability, and continuity within our legal system, particularly in matters concerning societal dynamics, religion, minority rights, and fundamental freedoms. 136. The undoubted reaffirmation of this position is palpable in subsequent judicial decisions, notably in the landmark case of TMA Pai [supra], wherein the Court refrained from providing a response to question 3(a) on the grounds that it did not warrant constitutional scrutiny by 11 Judges perhaps owing to the firmly established legal position. Apart from the fact that TMA Pai [supra] is binding upon us being a delivered by a larger bench of this Court, neither of the parties have argued that a divergent view ought to be taken in the present case. 137. At this stage, another aspect of the matter may be noted. In the formalised education sector, the majority of educational institutions operating through private means are registered as societies under various Acts. This encompasses a significant number of secular/non- minority institutions established as such. Such institutions, whether aided or unaided, in contrast to minority institutions, whether aided or unaided, are subjected to a significantly higher degree of regulation by the State in various aspects, including curriculum, admissions, teacher appointments, and other factors. Consequently, it is evident that private entities administering minority institutions enjoy a notably higher degree of freedom from such regulation. Hence, there exists a pronounced inclination on the part of non-minority institutions to seek minority status. 138. In the backdrop of this clamour for minority status, if minority status is deemed attainable without necessitating the factum of establishment of an institution by the minority at its inception, it may result in a widespread proliferation of institutions claiming to 4 Sakshi v.
