[ABHAY S. OKA, J.] of the Parliamentary and Legislative Assembly Constituencies made by A the Delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies s of 1976 and 1995 for the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Both the s of 1976 and 1995 have been expressly modified by the J&K Reorganisation Act by virtue of Sections 11(4) and 14(5) as provided in the second and third Schedules thereto. Hence, the argument deserves B to be rejected. 43. The petitioners have overlooked the fact that clause (b) of sub-Section (1) of Section 62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act has further amended the Delimitation Act, 2002 by providing that words and figures ‘census held in the year 2001’ appearing in the Delimitation Act shall be C construed as ‘census held in the year 2011’. To its application to the Union territory of J & K, the year 2001 in sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the Delimitation Act, 2002 has been substituted by the year 2011 and therefore, distribution of seats in the House of the People and seats assigned to the Legislative Assembly will have to be readjusted on the basis of 2011 census and the delimitation will have to be carried out on D the basis of the figures of the census held in the year 2011. The effect of Section 63 is that once the exercise of readjustment/delimitation is made on the basis of 2011 census figures, the same will be frozen till the relevant figures of the first census taken after 2026 are available. Therefore, the exercise of delimitation/readjustment of the seats in the Union Territory E of J & K was required to be made by the Delimitation Commission on the basis of the figures of the 2011 census. In view of Section 63, further readjustment can be carried out only after the publication of figures from the census held after the year 2026. 44. Reliance placed on the opinion of the learned Attorney General F of India is misplaced as it deals only with the provisions of the A.P. Reorganisation Act, 2014. The petitioners cannot rely upon the answer given by Hon’ble Minister in the Lok Sabha as it deals with delimitation of Constituencies in Telangana in the context of Article 170. In any event, the said opinion as well as the answer given by the Hon’ble Minister have no bearing on the interpretation of the J&K Reorganisation Act. G 45. A vague attempt was made by the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners to submit that the exercise which is undertaken for the newly created Union territory of J & K was not undertaken on the basis of the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000 and Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. In both the Acts, there is H 550 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A no provision which is pari materia with clause (b) of sub-Section (1) of Section 62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act which amended the provisions of the Delimitation Act 2002 in its applicability to the newly formed Union Territories by substituting the year 2001 with 2011.
