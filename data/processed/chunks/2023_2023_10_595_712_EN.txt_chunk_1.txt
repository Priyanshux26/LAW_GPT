Investigative agencies – Reports of – Held: The reports of E the intelligence agencies are not merely fact-finding reports – To argue that reports of the intelligence agencies may contain confidential information is one thing but to argue that the all such reports are confidential is another – Such an argument is misplaced and cannot be accepted on the touchstone of constitutional values – The reports by investigative agencies impact decisions on the life, F liberty, and profession of individuals and entities, and to give such reports absolute immunity from disclosure is antithetical to a transparent and accountable system – A blanket immunity from disclosure of all investigative reports cannot be granted.
