may be subsidiaries of some big companies. I further told him that big companies like L&T and Geo Miller could also be included in that list because it would give some respectability to the list. A1 thought for some time and told me that these two companies may also be included.” H 62 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 87. But in cross-examination, he admitted that Exhibit P-33 was a letter dated 22.10.1992 written by one Sri Kantarao, Manager (Civil/ Design) to Ganesan (PW-14) and that there was a note in that letter to the effect that Ganesan has discussed this matter with DGM, Civil. PW- 16 further admitted that it was possible that Ganesan might have discussed with him. B 88. The above statement in cross-examination shows that the discussion between PW-16 and PW-14 took place on 22.10.1992. But the discussion with A-1 and the dictation of five names took place even according to PW-16, only in November, 1992. In fact, Exhibit P-33 letter which was dated 22.10.1992, according to PW-16 dealt with inviting C limited tender. 89. If discussions had taken place between PW-16 and someone else in October, 1992 and a decision taken in that meeting to go for limited tender, it is inconceivable as to how the original sin can be attributed to A-1, especially when the discussion between PW-16 and A-1 took D place only in November, 1992 wherein the dictation of four bogus names and that of the prospective contractor allegedly took place. 90. PW-16 admitted during cross-examination that he discussed with A-1 on the day when tender documents were dispatched through ‘speed post’ and that was on 26.11.1992. But it was brought on record E through the evidence of DW-2 and DW-3 that A-1 was absent on 26.11.1992 due to the death of his mother-in-law. In any case, PW-16 admitted in cross-examination that he had signed Exhibit P-27 note even on 25.11.1992, which was one day before the date on which he had discussion with A-1. 91. The story advanced by PW-16 that the other four firms were F actually bogus firms, is belied by his own statement to the effect that as per Exhibits P-39 and P-40, two individuals represented two out of those four firms in the meeting held on 11.01.1993. If those firms were bogus firms, there is no explanation as to how they were represented in the meeting. G 92. It was admitted by PW-16 that in Exhibits P-53 and P-54, (letters written to two of those firms) there was an indication as though the letters were in continuation of the telephonic conversation they had. 93. In other words, two of the four firms, which were branded as bogus firms by PW-16, have had discussions with PW-16 and they have H also attended the meetings. A. SRINIVASULU v. THE STATE REP. BY THE INSPECTOR OF 63 POLICE [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] 94. To cap all this, PW-16 admitted: A “I recommended the contract to be given to Entoma who was the lowest tenderer.
