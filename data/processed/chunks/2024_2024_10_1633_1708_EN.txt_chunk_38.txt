District Magistrate, Thana,108 a Constitution Bench of this Court was called upon to decide the validity of the detention of the petitioner under the Preventive Detention Amendment Act 1950.109 The Detention Act 1950 was due to expire on 1 April 1951, but the legislation was amended to prolong its life by another year till 1 April 1952. The petitioner was detained on 15 November 1951 and his detention would have expired on 1 April 1952 with the expiration of the enactment. However, the Detention Act 1950 was amended in 1952, further prolonging its application for six months till 1 October 1952. The issue before this Court was whether the prolonging of the Detention Act 1950 also prolonged the detention of the petitioner. 56. Justice Vivian Bose, writing for the Constitution Bench, held that the detention continued until the expiry of the Detention Act 1950 on 1 October 1952. The learned Judge further observed: 108 [1956] 1 SCR 644 : (1952) 2 SCC 1 109 “Detention Act 1950” [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1681 Union of India & Ors. v. Rajeev Bansal “7. The rule is that when a subsequent Act amends an earlier one in such a way as to incorporate itself, or a part of itself, into the earlier, then the earlier Act must thereafter be read and construed (except where that would lead to a repugnancy, inconsistency or absurdity) as if the altered words had been written into the earlier Act with pen and ink and the old words scored out so that thereafter there is no need to refer to the amending Act at all. […] Bearing this in mind it will be seen that the 1950 Act remains the 1950 Act all the way through even with its subsequent amendments. Therefore, the moment the 1952 Act was passed and Section 2 came into operation, the Act of 1950 meant the 1950 Act as amended by Section 2, that is to say, the 1950 Act now due to expire on 1-10-1952.” (emphasis supplied) The principle which emanates from Shamrao V Parulekar (supra) is that after an amendment, the legislation has to be read along with the amended provisions. 57. The legislative practice of amendment by substitution is often used by the legislatures. The process of substitution of a statutory provision generally involves two steps: first, the existing rule is deleted; and second, the new rule is brought into existence in its place.110 The deletion effectively repeals the existing provision.111 Thus, an amendment by substitution results in the repeal of an earlier provision and its replacement by a new provision.112 The repealed provision will cease to operate from the date of repeal and the substituted provision will commence operation from the date of its substitution.113 After the substitution, the legislation must be read and construed as if the altered words have been written into the legislation “with pen and ink and the old words scored out.”114 Therefore, after amendment 110 Koteswar Vittal Kamath v.
