In the present case, the Petitioner has now spent about 10.5 months in detention without any review as to whether his continued detention is necessary. 1.4 The State has contended that the proviso to S. 3(2) refers to the period for which the State Government can delegate its powers to a District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police, relying on the s of Harpreet Kaur v. State of Maharashtra, (1992) 2 SCC 177; T. Devaki v. Government of Tamil Nadu, (1990) 2 SCC 456; and Aravind Choudhary v. State of Telangana, dt. 05.05.2017 in Crl. Appeal No. 924/ 2017. It is submitted that these s are inapplicable in the facts of the present case. 1.5 First, all the s cited by the Respondents were concerned with the validity of detention s passed directly under S. 3(1) of the concerned statute [see para 2 of Harpreet Kaur; para 1 of T. Devaki, and page 2 of Aravind Chaudhary]. An argument was raised in these cases that the detention s [under S. 3(1)] could not be issued for a period exceeding 3 months as per the proviso to S. 3(2). It was in this context that the fi ndings in paras 33 of Harpreet Kaur, para 8 of T. Devaki and in Aravind Choudhary were rendered. These fi ndings cannot therefore be applied to s issued in exercise of delegated powers under S. 3(2) of the Act. This is evident from the observation of this Hon’ble Court in Aravind Choudhary that: “…the limit of three months is applicable to Section 3(2) of the above said Act and not to Section 3(1). This is clear from three judge Bench of this Court in 1990 (2) SCC 456 T. Devaki Vs. Government of Tamil Nadu…”. On the other hand, the detention in Cherukuri Mani was issued by the District Magistrate [para 2] i.e. under S. 3(2) of the AP Act, and hence this is directly on the point. 1.6 Secondly, the interpretation sought to be advanced by the State renders the proviso to S. 3(2) meaningless. In terms of S. 3(3) of 534 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. the AP Act, the offi cer under S. 3(2) is required to “forthwith” report the detention and grounds to the Government and “no such shall remain in force for more than twelve days after the making thereof, unless, in the meantime, it has been approved by the Government”. S. 3(3) therefore checks the issuance of preventive detention s in exercise of delegated powers by immediately subjecting them to scrutiny and confi rmation by the State Government. 1.7 Restricting the time period for which the State Government can delegate its powers to such an offi cer to 3 months at a time neither curbs any mischief nor serves any fruitful purpose. This is so since an under S. 3(2) is much shorter-lived, and lapses in 12 days unless approved by the Government. Pertinently, as per S. 3(2) and 3(3) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (repealed), on which the State statutes are modelled, also such s were valid for 12 days.
