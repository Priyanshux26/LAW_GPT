5 [1981] 2 SCR 352 : (1981) 2 SCC 427 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 691 Prabir Purkayastha v. State (NCT of Delhi) 29. The language used in Article 22(1) and Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India regarding the communication of the grounds is exactly the identical. Neither of the constitutional provisions require that the ‘grounds’ of “arrest” or “detention”, as the case may be, must be communicated in writing. Thus, interpretation to this important facet of the fundamental right as made by the Constitution Bench while examining the scope of Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India would ipso facto apply to Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India insofar the requirement to communicate the grounds of arrest is concerned. 30. Hence, we have no hesitation in reiterating that the requirement to communicate the grounds of arrest or the grounds of detention in writing to a person arrested in connection with an offence or a person placed under preventive detention as provided under Articles 22(1) and 22(5) of the Constitution of India is sacrosanct and cannot be breached under any situation. Non-compliance of this constitutional requirement and statutory mandate would lead to the custody or the detention being rendered illegal, as the case may be. 31. Furthermore, the provisions of Article 22(1) have already been interpreted by this Court in Pankaj Bansal (supra) laying down beyond the pale of doubt that the grounds of arrest must be communicated in writing to the person arrested of an offence at the earliest. Hence, the fervent plea of learned ASG that there was no requirement under law to communicate the grounds of arrest in writing to the accused appellant is noted to be rejected. 32. Now, coming to the facts of the case at hand. Indisputably, FIR No. 224 of 2023 came to be registered on 17th August, 2023. Copy of the FIR was never brought in public domain as the same was not uploaded on the website by the Investigating Agency. Admittedly, the copy of the FIR was not provided to the appellant despite an application having been made in this regard on his behalf till after the of police custody remand was passed by the learned Remand Judge. 33. The copy of the FIR was provided to Shri Arshdeep Khurana, learned Advocate representing the accused for the first time on 5th October, 2023 and hence, till the time of being deprived of liberty, no communication had been made to the appellant regarding the grounds on which he had been arrested. 692 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 34. The accused was arrested on 3rd October, 2023 at 5:45 p.m. as per the arrest memo (Annexure P-7). As per Section 43C of the UAPA, the provisions of CrPC shall apply to all arrests, search and seizures made under the UAPA insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act. As per Section 57 CrPC read with Section 167(1) CrPC, the appellant was required to be produced before the concerned Magistrate within twenty-four hours of his arrest.
