VI. Traversing frontiers: international human rights norms 117. The development of child rights law is highly influenced by the evolving legal standards in international law. The comity of nations has arrived at a broad consensus rooted in the goal to realise universal human rights of children. Domestically and abroad, various jurisdictions have developed their legal standards under the influence of global advancements in international bodies. It is therefore instructive to look at the progress made and prevailing standards on child rights in the context of early and forced marriage in international law. We shall therefore trace the universal framework on child rights, various regional advancements and the rights-based framework against child marriage presently. 1580 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports A. Universal framework 118. Early international conventions did not explicitly prohibit child marriage. With the evolution of international law, the community of nations inched closer to an agreeable standard against child marriage. We shall trace this evolution in international human rights norms presently. First, we shall briefly overview the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,154 then we shall explore the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956155 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966.156 Lastly we shall look at the two seminal conventions on the issue of child marriage, namely, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 1979157 and the CRC 1989. i. Universal Declaration of Human Rights 119. The UDHR adopted as General Assembly Resolution 217 A (III) in 1948,158 set forth fundamental principles regarding the right to marry. Article 16(1) of the UDHR stipulates that men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality, or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family.159 They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage, and at its dissolution. Article 16(2) further stipulates that marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.160 Although it does not specify a minimum age for marriage, the UDHR establishes that marriage should be based on free and full consent, laying an early framework for safeguarding autonomy and protecting individuals from coerced or forced marriages.161 120.
