The Certificate also explicitly stated that the Custodian was obligated to pay house tax and other local taxes on behalf of this property. 4.3 The assessee, along with other tenants, inter-alia, contested the assessment s issued by the Municipal Corporation and approached the High Court of Allahabad at Lucknow by filing Writ Petition being Misc. Bench No. 3979 of 2003. However, this legal action was ultimately uncontested by the tenants and was subsequently dismissed vide dated 30.03.2017. 4.4 Due to outstanding dues of Rs.1,621,987.00/- under the head of House Tax concerning the Enemy Property No.31/58 Hazaratganj, the Municipal Corporation, vide letter dated 28.03.2005 notified the District Magistrate, Lucknow, of its intention to proceed with attachment and sealing of the said premises under Sections 506-509 of the Act of 1959. 4.5 At this juncture, it is necessary to state that Raja Mohammed Amir Mohammad Khan, the son of the Raja of Mahmudabad, who remained in India as an Indian citizen, had been actively seeking the release of enemy properties owned by his late father. He contended that these properties should no longer be vested with the Custodian after his father’s demise as they were now vested in him, an Indian citizen. While the Government had agreed to release 25% of these properties, it had not yet acted upon this commitment. In response, Raja Mohammed Amir Mohammad Khan approached the Bombay High Court by way of filing WP No.1524 of 1997. The High Court ruled [2024] 2 S.C.R. 855 Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab. Pvt. Ltd. & Others in his favor, directing the Custodian to surrender possession of the properties to him. Being aggrieved with this decision, the Union of India approached this Court by way of filing SLP (C) No.22452 of 2001, which was converted to Civil Appeal No.2501 of 2002. This Court by its dated 21.10.2005 reported in Union of India vs. Raja Mohammad Amir Mohammad Khan, (2005) 8 SCC 696 (‘Amir Mohammad Khan’), dismissed the appeal preferred by the Union of India and directed the Union of India to get the buildings (residence or offices) vacated from such officers and handover the possession to Raja Mohammed Amir Mohammad Khan within eight weeks. The Court further directed that the officers who are in occupation of buildings for their residences or for their offices shall immediately vacate and hand over the buildings or the properties to the Custodian to enable him to hand over the possession. 4.6 As a result of these s, proceedings were initiated by various tenants, including respondent No.1. This Court, in SLP (Civil) No.14943 of 2006 vide dated 08.09.2006, clarified its earlier dated 21.10.2005 passed in Civil Appeal No.2501 of 2002. It was clarified by this Court that individuals who were allotted properties by the Custodian or who came into possession after 1965, i.e., following the declaration of Raja Mahmudabad’s property as an enemy property and the appointment of the Custodian, were required to vacate these properties. However, persons claiming possession prior to the Custodian’s appointment, based on valid tenancy agreements established by Raja Mahmudabad or his General Power of Attorney, were exempted from this directive.
