Therefore, the decisions of this Court in the cases of Parmar Constructions Company and Pardeep Vinod Construction Company cannot be said to be per incuriam and/or in conflict with the decision of this Court in the F case of BCCI. In the case of Parmar Constructions Company which is directly on the point, it isspecifically observed and held that the 2015 Amendment Act, which came into force w.e.f. 23.10.2015 shall not apply to the arbitral proceedings which are commenced in accordance with the provisions of section 21 of the principal Act, 1996 before the coming into force the 2015 G Amendment Act, unless parties otherwise agree (para 27). Similar view has been expressed in the case of S.P. Singla Constructions Private Limited. [Paras 9, 9.1][351-E-H; 352-A-C, D-G] H 330 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A Union of India Vs. Parmar Construction Company, (2019) 15 SCC 682 : [2019] 5 SCR 1009; Union of India Vs. Pradeep Vinod Construction Company, (2020) 2 SCC 464 : [2012] 17 SCR 64; S.P. Singla Constructions Private Limited Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh and Anr. (2019) 2 SCC 488 : [2018 14 SCR B 1005 – relied on. 1.3 In the present case the notice invoking arbitration clause was issued on 26.12.2013, i.e., much prior to the Amendment Act, 2015 and the application under Section 11(6) of the Act has been preferred/filed on 27.04.2016, i.e., much after the C amendment Act came into force, the law prevailing prior to the Amendment Act, 2015 shall be applicable and therefore the High Court has rightly entered into the question of accord and satisfaction and has rightly dismissed the application under section 11(6) of the Act applying the principal Act, namely, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, prevailing prior to the Amendment D Act, 2015. This Court is in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court. In a case where the notice invoking arbitration is issued prior to the Amendment Act, 2015 and the application under Section 11 for appointment of an arbitrator is made post Amendment Act, 2015, the provisions of pre- E Amendment Act, 2015 shall be applicable and not the Amendment Act, 2015.
