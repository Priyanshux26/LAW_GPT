14.2.10 The instant proposal was again considered on 11.05.2017 in the 133rd GEAC meeting, wherein the report submitted by the sub-committee was examined in detail and GEAC recommended the proposal with certain terms and conditions for further approval by the Competent Authority. But pursuant to receipt of various representations from different stakeholders, matters related to environmental release of transgenic mustard were kept pending for further review. 14.2.11 In the 134th meeting of GEAC held on 21.03.2018, it was recorded that the instant proposal was referred back to GEAC for its re-examination, pursuant to receipt of several representations, both in support and against, after the 133rd meeting of GEAC held on 11.05.2017. In this meeting, GEAC examined all the representations and reiterated that these representations were already deliberated extensively while taking the decision in the 133rd meeting of GEAC. After a detailed discussion, GEAC [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2009 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. agreed that the applicant may be advised to undertake field demonstration on transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 in an area of five acres at two to three different locations, with a view to generate additional data on honey bees and other pollinators and on soil microbial diversity. 14.2.12 The instant matter was re-examined in the 136th meeting of GEAC held on 20.09.2018, wherein the said Committee accorded permission for conduct of field demonstration studies on honey bees and other pollinators at two locations of up to five acres in each location namely Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana and Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi. 14.2.13 Thereafter, in the 137th meeting of GEAC held on 20.03.2019, the Committee noted the response from the applicant regarding the reasons for deferment of field demonstration studies on transgenic mustard during the season 2018-19 and the deferment was further extended for the seasons 2019-20 and 2020-21. 14.2.14 At this stage, Prof. Deepak Pental, Former Professor of Genetics and Vice-Chancellor, University of Delhi, on behalf of CGMCP, University of Delhi, South Campus, New Delhi, made a representation on 10.05.2022 to the Hon’ble Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, to accept the recommendations for environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 made in 133rd GEAC meeting. Accordingly, comments were sought from the concerned Department, namely DBT and Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE). Some of the relevant comments related to the present matter are reproduced herein below: “The comments received from DARE: “GEAC may consider exempting additional studies on the impact of GM Mustard hybrid DMH-11 containing the bar, barnase, and barstar genes on honey bees and other pollinators as decided in its 136th meeting and the recommendation of the 133rd meeting of GEAC may be considered. The environmental release of 2010 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the proposed events will broaden the scope for developing many high yielding mustard hybrids in future. The comments received from DBT: Based on the scientific evidence and the available data from various international agencies, it seems likely that there were no major deviations in the behavior of honey bees when compared among the transgenic and non-transgenic comparator lines; and suggested that GEAC may consider its recommendations of the 133rd meeting on the environmental release of GE mustard.” Soon thereafter, ICAR by its letter dated 30.07.2022 wrote to MoEF&CC for GEAC to consider the recommendation for environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 made in its 133rd GEAC meeting.
