Income Tax Act, 1961– s.90– Agreement with foreign countries or specifi ed territories – Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)– Notifi cation u/s.90, if mandatory to give eff ect to a DTAA or any Protocol changing its terms/conditions– “is” occurring in the DTAAs – Interpretation – Bilat-eral treaties between India and Netherlands, France, and Switzerland, respectively– Plea of as-sessee that having regard to the Protocol to the India-Franwce DTAA, the more restrictive defi ni-tion of ‘fees for technical services’ appearing in the India-UK DTAA, must be read as forming part of the India-France DTAA as well– Disagreed by Authority for Advance Ruling– Reversed by High Court– In another appeal, relating to the India-Netherlands DTAA, the assessees contended that regard being had to the phraseology of the DTAA and the subsequent Protocol, the relevant event relied upon- the provisions of the DTAA and the Protocol, obliged the revenue to extend the lower rate of withholding tax at 5%– In case of Nestle, the provisions of the India-Switzerland DTAA and its three protocols considered– Writ petitions allowed by High Court: 1139 114 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. Held: A notifi cation u/s.90(1) is necessary and a mandatory condition for a court, authority, or tribunal to give eff ect to a DTAA, or any protocol changing its terms or conditions, which has the eff ect of altering the existing provisions of law – The fact that a stipulation in a DTAA or a Protocol with one nation, requires same treatment in respect to a matter covered by its terms, subsequent to its being entered into when another nation (which is member of a multilateral organization such as OECD), is given better treatment, does not automatically lead to integration of such term extending the same benefi t in regard to a matter covered in the DTAA of the fi rst nation, which entered into DTAA with India – In such event, the terms of the earlier DTAA require to be amended through a separate notifi cation u/s.90 – Further, the interpretation of the expression “is” has present signifi cation and it derives meaning from the context – Therefore, for a party to claim benefi t of a “same treatment” clause, based on entry of DTAA between India and another state which is member of OECD, the relevant date is entering into treaty with India, and not a later date, when, after entering into DTAA with India, such country be-comes an OECD member, in terms of India’s practice – Impugned s set aside – International Convention/Treaties.
