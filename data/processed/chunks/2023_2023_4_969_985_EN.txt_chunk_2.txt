[Paras 26, 27][982-C-E] F 1.5 Approval of DIOS is mandatory and that the Act injuncts the appointment of a Teacher without such approval. The legal regime concerning the appointment of Teachers does not contemplate any concept of deemed appointment if the DIOS does not decide upon the proposal within 15 days. Under these circumstances, the reference to and reliance on the principle that G Rules that existed at the time when vacancies arose will govern the appointments is misplaced. [Para 29][982-G-H; 983-A] H 972 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 1.6 In any event, it is now a settled principle of law that a candidate has a right to be considered in the light of existing Rules, which implies Rules in force as on the date of consideration. Thus, the submission by Respondents, that the vacancies that existed prior to the amendment of Regulation 17 of Chapter II, must be governed by unamended rules is rejected.
