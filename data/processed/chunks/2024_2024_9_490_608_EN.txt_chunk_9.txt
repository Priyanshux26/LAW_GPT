Digital Supreme Court Reports illegal – However, an arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction to interpret a contract having regard to terms and conditions of the contract, conduct of the parties including correspondences exchanged, circumstances of the case and pleadings of the parties – If the conclusion of the arbitrator is based on a possible view of the matter, the Court should not interfere – But where, on a full reading of the contract, the view of the arbitral tribunal on the terms of a contract is not a possible view, the award would be considered perverse and as such amenable to interference. [Para 72] Arbitration – Arbitration agreement/contract – Unexpressed term, if can be read into a contract as an implied condition: Held : Ordinarily, terms of the contract are to be understood in the way the parties wanted and intended them to be – In agreements of arbitration, where party autonomy is the grund norm, how the parties worked out the agreement, is one of the indicators to decipher the intention, apart from the plain or grammatical meaning of the expressions used – However, reading an unexpressed term in an agreement would be justified on the basis that such a term was always and obviously intended by the parties thereto – Unexpressed term can be implied if, and only if, the court finds that the parties must have intended that term to form part of their contract – It is not enough for the court to find that such a term would have been adopted by the parties as reasonable men if it had been suggested to them – Rather, it must have been a term that went without saying, a term necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, a term which, although tacit, forms part of the contract – But before an implied condition, not expressly found in the contract, is read into a contract, by invoking the business efficacy doctrine, it must be reasonable and equitable; it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, that is, a term will not be implied if the contract is effective without it; it must be obvious, it must be capable of clear expression; and it must not contradict any terms of the contract.
