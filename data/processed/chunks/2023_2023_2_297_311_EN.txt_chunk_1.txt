The argument of D the respondent/alleged contemnors that there ought to be an exercise of verification, therefore, appears to be merited and substantial. Thus, given the nature of the interim s made during the pendency of the appeal, there can be no doubt that the court declared the appointments to be valid to the extent, they E conformed to the concerned rules and binding norms. The court, in contempt proceeding cannot enlarge its scope and examine matters which are not part of its remit, i.e. extent of the direction or s contained in the judgement of which contempt being alleged.

George Ravishekaran (2014) 3 SCC 373 : [2014] 4 SCR 27 – relied on. 1.2 Further proceedings cannot be continued as no determination can be made unless there is a due verification in regard to the employment of each of the petitioners. Furthermore, G this court, in lawful exercise of contempt jurisdiction, cannot examine the merits of a decision, whether the state or the madrasa’s stand that any of the petitioners is entitled to the benefits of being treated as an employee, having regard to the concerned rules and regulations.
