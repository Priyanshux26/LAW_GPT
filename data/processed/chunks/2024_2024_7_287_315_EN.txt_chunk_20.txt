It is trite law that when an entails adverse civil consequences or is prejudicial to the person concerned, it is essential that principles of natural justice are followed. In the 314 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports instant case, though show cause notice was issued to the assessee to which reply was also filed, the same would not be adequate having regard to the consequences that such an passed under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act would entail. Even though the statute may be silent regarding notice and hearing, the court would read into such provision the inherent requirement of notice and hearing before a prejudicial is passed. We, therefore, hold that before an is passed under Section 206C of the Income Tax Act, it is incumbent upon the assessing officer to put the person concerned to notice and afford him an adequate and reasonable opportunity of hearing, including a personal hearing. 20. In view of the discussions made above and the conclusions reached, it is not necessary for us to delve into other contours of the lis. Thus, the question framed in paragraph 3 above, is answered in the negative by holding that Section 206C of the Income Tax Act is not applicable in respect of Mysore Sales and that the liquor vendors(contractors) who bought the vending rights from the appellant on auction cannot be termed as “buyers” within the meaning of Explanation(a) to Section 206C of the Income Tax Act. We also hold that the High Court was not justified in dismissing the writ petitions and consequently, the writ appeal challenging the s dated 17.01.2001. 21. Having regard to the discussions made above, we are of the view that the appeal should be allowed. Accordingly, we pass the following : (i) and dated 13.03.2006 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in Writ Appeal No. 7926/2003 and connected writ appeals, is hereby set aside; (ii) and dated 27.10.2003 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in Writ Petition Nos. 6869-6874 of 2001 and other connected writ petitions, is hereby set aside; and (iii) s dated 17.01.2001 passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS)–1, Bengaluru under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act for the assessment years 2000-2001, 1999-2000, 1998- 1999, 1997-1998, 1996-1997 and 1995-1996 as well [2024] 7 S.C.R. 315 The Excise Commissioner Karnataka & Anr. v. Mysore Sales International Ltd. & Ors. as the consequential demand notices of even date issued under Section 156 of the Income Tax Act, are hereby set aside and quashed. 22.
