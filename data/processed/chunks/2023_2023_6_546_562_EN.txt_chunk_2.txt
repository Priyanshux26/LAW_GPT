[Para 15][558-B- C] Dhartipakar Madan Lal Agarwal v. Rajiv Gandhi (1987) Supp SCC 93 : [1987] SCR 369; V.S. F Achuthanandan v. P.J. Francis & Anr. (1999) 3 SCC 737 : [1999] 2 SCR 99 – relied on. 1.4 Paragraphs 3 and 4 are unnecessary, which do not deal with something which happened after the election was declared. Therefore, the said paragraphs being irrelevant will have to be G ed to be deleted under Rule 16 of VI of CPC. Paragraph 5 is not material for the alleged cause of action. Paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 do not disclose any material facts in relation to the allegations of corrupt practices. As material facts regarding allegations of corrupt practice have not been pleaded, the election H SENTHIBALAJI V. v. A.P. GEETHA AND ORS. 549 petition does not disclose any cause of action as far as the ground A of corrupt practice is concerned. Therefore, even these paragraphs deserve to be deleted. The ground of improper acceptance of the nomination paper is not supported by material facts. In any case, the ground of improper acceptance of the nomination paper is no longer relevant as the term of the appellant B has already expired. Therefore, in view of the findings which recorded, no purpose will be served by keeping the Election Petition pending. Accordingly, the impugned of the High Court is set aside and the applications filed by the appellant for rejection of the petition and/or for deletion of irrelevant paragraphs are allowed.
