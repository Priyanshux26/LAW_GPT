It is well-established from the precedents cited that vulgarity and profanities do not per se amount to obscenity.75 While a person may find vulgar and expletive-filled language to be distasteful, unpalatable, uncivil, and improper, that by itself is not sufficient to be ‘obscene’. Obscenity relates to material that arouses sexual and lustful thoughts, which is not at all the effect of the abusive language 75 Samaresh Bose (supra), para 35; Bobby Art International (supra), para 29; NS Madhanagopal v. K. Lalitha, [2022] 15 SCR 649 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 2030 : 2022 INSC 1323 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1175 Apoorva Arora & Anr. Etc. v. State (Govt. of Nct of Delhi) & Anr. or profanities that have been employed in the episode. Rather, such language may evoke disgust, revulsion, or shock.76 The reality of the High Court’s finding is that once it found the language to be profane and vulgar, it has in fact moved away from the requirements of obscenity under Section 67 of the IT Act. The High Court failed to notice the inherent contradiction in its conclusions. 36. No objective consideration: Third, the High Court has erred in the legal approach followed by it while assessing whether the material is obscene. In Samaresh Bose (supra), this Court has laid down, in great depth and detail, the process and method that must be followed to objectively judge whether the material is obscene.77 The court must consider the work as a whole and then the specific portions that have been alleged to be obscene in the context of the whole work to arrive at its conclusion.78 Further, the court must first step into the position of the creator to understand what he intends to convey from the work and whether it has any literary or artistic value. It must then step into the position of the reader or viewer who is likely to consume the work and appreciate the possible influence on the minds of such reader.79 However, the High Court has not followed this judicial process before arriving at its conclusion, which is as follows: “43. Coming back to case at hand, the specific complaint of petitioner is that in Episode 05 of Season 01, airtime starting from 5 minutes and 24 seconds onwards upto 6 minutes and 40 seconds as well as from 25 minutes and 28 seconds upto 25 minutes and 46 seconds, the language of male and female protagonist is full of obscenity, vulgar words and expletives, without there being any warning or filter imposing restriction of age of viewers to whom the content should be visible. The language used in Episode 05 of Season 01 was heard by this Court, and the level of obscenity of the language and sentences used was such that this Court cannot reproduce it in the 76 Samaresh Bose (supra), para 35 77 Samaresh Bose (supra), para 29 78 ibid; Ranjit Udeshi (supra), paras 20 and 21 79 Samaresh Bose (supra), para 29 1176 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
