Adding to the above, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh vide dated 25.08.2009 had also stayed the proceedings in Case No. 15003 of 2007 (State vs. Ashok Dixit) under Section 34 of the Excise Act which is pending before the CJM, Gwalior for the reason that a decision in that case might cause severe prejudice to the case of murder of the appellant’s brother. 77. The statements of the respondent nos. 3, 4 and 5 respectively recorded earlier by the IO at Dakshin, Firozabad during the course of his investigation on 23.01.2008 and later by the SHO of the Murar Police Station, D.S. Khushawa on 12.02.2008, under Section 161 CrPC, are the only pieces of evidence that have been adduced before us for our consideration. Those statements reveal that – (a) amongst the two panchas of arrest and seizure namely, Shailendra Singh and Triloki Gaur in the alleged false second case i.e., Case Crime No. 967 of 2007, Triloki Gaur was the former driver of the respondent no. 1, (b) the respondent no. 1 had arrived at the Murar Police Station shortly after the alleged arrest of Ashok Dixit and had conversed with the SHO of the Murar Police Station, D. S. Khushawa, (c) the [2024] 12 S.C.R. 833 Om Prakash Yadav v. Niranjan Kumar Upadhyay & Ors. respondent no. 1 also had a conversation with the person arrested by the accused respondents, and (d) the respondent no. 1 had asked the SHO of the Murar Police Station, D.S. Khushawa, to release the arrested person on bail stating that he was his relative. However, it is settled law that a statement recorded under Section 161 CrPC does not constitute substantive evidence and can only be utilized for the limited purpose of proving contradictions and/or omissions as envisaged under Section 145 of the Evidence Act, 1872. This has been laid down in a catena of decisions including in Parvat Singh and Others v. State of Madhya Pradesh reported in (2020) 4 SCC 33 which observed as follows: “13.1…However, as per the settled proposition of law a statement recorded under Section 161 CrPC is inadmissible in evidence and cannot be relied upon or used to convict the accused. As per the settled proposition of law, the statement recorded under Section 161 CrPC can be used only to prove the contradictions and/or omissions. Therefore, as such, the High Court has erred in relying upon the statement of PW 8 recorded under Section 161 CrPC while observing that the appellants were having the lathis.” (emphasis supplied) 78. The aforesaid position of law was reiterated in Birbal Nath v. State of Rajasthan reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1396 which observed as thus: “19. Statement given to police during investigation under Section 161 cannot be read as an “evidence”. It has a limited applicability in a Court of Law as prescribed under Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.). 20. No doubt statement given before police during investigation under Section 161 are “previous statements” under Section 145 of the Evidence Act and therefore can be used to cross examine a witness.
