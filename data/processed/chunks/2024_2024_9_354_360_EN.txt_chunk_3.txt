Thereafter, the respondent has also pleaded that the appellant was serving as a Committee Officer in the Assembly Secretariat, Manipur Legislative Assembly till 31.12.2021, yet, she has shown her income for FY 2021-22 as Rs.0/-, which is untrue. In para 16 of the Election Petition, the respondent has referred to Section 33 of RPA and alleged non-compliance with the requirement of furnishing true and correct information by candidates. Further, in ground A (as reproduced above) it is asserted that since the appellant has concealed her investment of Rs. 2 crores in her land, her nomination papers ought to have been rejected. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 359 Kimneo Haokip Hangshing v. Kenn Raikhan & Ors. On a perusal of the petition as a whole, including the averments reproduced above, it is clear that a cause of action has been disclosed by the respondent. Whether the appellant has concealed her investments and her income, and thus her nomination has been improperly accepted, is a triable issue. 9. Secondly, the affidavit, which is required as per the proviso to Section 83(1)(c) of RPA has to be given in Form 25 as per the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, where Rule 94A reads as under: “94A. Form of affidavit to be filed with election petition.— The affidavit referred to in the proviso to subsection (1) of section 83 shall be sworn before a magistrate of the first class or a notary or a commissioner of oaths and shall be in Form 25.” The relevant portion of Form 25 is also reproduced below: I, ______, the petitioner in the accompanying election petition calling in question the election of Shri/Shrimati _____ (Respondent No.__) in the said petition) make solemn affirmation/oath and say— (a) that the statements made in paragraphs ________ of the accompanying election petition about the commission of the corrupt practice of ________ and the particulars of such corrupt practice mentioned in paragraphs ________ of the same petition and in paragraphs _________ of the Schedule annexed thereto are true to my knowledge; (b) that the statements made in paragraphs ________ of the said petition about the commission of the corrupt practice of _________ and the particulars of such corrupt practice given in paragraphs _________ of the said petition and in paragraphs _______ of the Schedule annexed thereto are true to my information… 10. A question had come up before a three Judge Bench of this Court in G.M. Siddeshwar v. Prasanna Kumar (2013) 4 SCC 776 as to whether an Election Petition is liable to be dismissed at the very threshold even if the allegations of corrupt practices of a returned candidate have not been given by a petitioner in terms of the proviso in Section 83(1)(c) of RPA. The finding of this Court was 360 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports that this cannot be done even if an affidavit is not filed in terms of the proviso. What is mandatory, however, is that there should be substantial compliance. In other words, if substantial compliance in terms of furnishing all that is required under the law has been given, the petition cannot be summarily dismissed.
