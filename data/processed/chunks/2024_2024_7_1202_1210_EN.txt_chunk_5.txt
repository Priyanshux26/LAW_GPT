14. Once the High Court had held that the Will dated 12.12.1988 was genuine and bona fide and duly proved and, further that the Will dated 16.05.1994 was not a valid document being shrouded with suspicious circumstances, there was no occasion for the High Court to have shown any kind of sympathy with the purchasers i.e. defendants 2, 4 and 5. Once the Will itself was held to be invalid, no right accrued in favour of defendant no.1, and if defendant no.1 did not receive any right, title or interest under the Will dated 16.05.1994, there was no question of defendants 2, 4 and 5 getting any better right, title or interest than defendant no.1 their vendor. We find substance in the aforesaid submission as from the pleadings, evidence and material 1210 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports on record, we find that the submission on behalf of the plaintiffs- appellants is fully substantiated. As such, the appeal filed by the plaintiffs-appellants deserves to be allowed. 15. Insofar as the appeal filed by the defendant no.1 is concerned, we are more than clear that the findings recorded by the first Appellate Court and the High Court on the validity of the second Will dated 16.05.1994 being shrouded with suspicious circumstances, is well reasoned and based on evidence on record. The defendant no.1 had completely failed to dispel and clear the clouds surrounding the Will dated 16.05.1994. The first Appellate Court has dealt with in great detail on the said aspect, which finding has been affirmed by the High Court. The same being a pure finding of fact, we are not inclined to interfere with the same. As such, the appeal filed by the defendant no.1, Vikram Singh is liable to be dismissed. 16. In view of the above, the Appeal No.8187 of 2023 is allowed. The of the High Court to the extent it extends benefit to the defendant nos.2, 4 and 5 is set aside and that of the first Appellate Court decreeing the suit in totality is affirmed. The Appeal No.8188 of 2023 is, hereby, dismissed. Result of the case: Appeal No. 8187 of 2023 allowed. Appeal No. 8188 of 2023 dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankitesh Ojha, Hony.
