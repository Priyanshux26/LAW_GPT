We also hold that such a right would continue till the execution of a conveyance i.e. issuance of sale certificate in favour of the mortgagee. A similar view has been taken by this Branch in M/s Hoshiarpur Roller Flour Mill Private Limited and another V/s Punjab National Bank (CWP No. 1440 of 2021). … 1686 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports It would therefore, certainly be available to the Petitioners herein before the issuance of sale certificate in favour of Respondent Nos. 2 and 3. Point (a) is answered accordingly in favour of the Petitioners and against the Respondents.” 20. The said also considered and distinguished the of this Hon’ble Court in Shakeena and Anr. V/s Bank of India and Ors. (2021) SCC 761 [Annexure R-6] holding that that the said case did not consider the concept of redemption u/s 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. It is submitted that the observations in para 30 of Shakeena are in the nature of obiter dicta as in the said case the auction had concluded prior to the amendment of Section 13(8) and in any event the sale certificate had already been issued. Thus, the question of interpretation of Section 13(8) was not directly in issue. Effect of amendment to S. 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, 2002 21. It was vehemently argued by the Petitioners that the amended provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFESI Act, 2002 puts a positive restriction upon the Mortgagor to restrict its right of redemption until the date of publication of the notice. 22. A perusal of the Report The report of Joint Committee on the Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (Amendment) Bill, 2016 [Annexure R-7], more particularly para 24, shows that the proposed amendment to S. 13(8) of the Act was intended to deal with: - “Provisions to stop secured creditor to lease or assignment or sale in the prescribed conditions”. The important thing to note is also that the report does not indicate that the Committee had considered the effect of Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which is a [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1687 Celir LLP v. Mr. Sumati Prasad Bafna & Ors. general law regarding redemption of mortgage vis a vis the provisions of SARFAESI. 23. The focus of the Committee in the said reply is on the obligations of the Mortgagee to not create third party rights up to a certain time-period, but it is silent on the rights of the Mortgagor to exercise its redemption for which Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is the relevant provision. 24. It is further necessary to note that the non obstante clause in Section 13 specifically excludes only S. 69 and 69A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. This section does not specifically include the words “Notwithstanding anything contained in any other Act for the time being in force” which is the standard term used in non obstante clauses.
