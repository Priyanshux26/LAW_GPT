As regards the auction purchaser, G the Company Court relied upon a decision of the Bombay High Court holding that the purchaser was liable to pay property tax only from date of purchase. The Company Court observed and held, inter alia, as under:- 7 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the M.P. Act of 1956’. H 8 Hereinafter referred to as ‘the Companies Act’. OFFICIAL LIQUIDATOR v. UJJAIN NAGAR PALIKA NIGAM 1089 & ORS. [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] “The company may be wound up and its business closed down. A Yet, the Official Liquidator would be obliged to protect the assets of the company in liquidation, until such time as the assets are sold. For the protection of assets, the Official Liquidator representing the company might have to retain rented premises, obtain supply of electricity, engage security guards and take such B other steps involving expenses as the Official Liquidator might deem necessary. Can claims on account of inter alia rent, electricity charges that accrued after the date of winding up, be outright rejected only on the ground that the claims were post liquidation claims even though the company in liquidation might have sufficient funds to satisfy the claims? C An electricity supplier, may, as argued by Mr. Ghosh, have the option of disconnecting supply for non-payment of its dues and appropriating the security deposit of the consumer. The right of disconnection would not, however, make any difference to the maintainability of the claim of the supplier. D It is not in dispute that the Official Liquidator has been making payment of post liquidation electricity charges. The compulsion to make payment cannot, however, make any difference to the legal status of the claim. E If charges on account of supply of electricity after the date of liquidation are payable, so is rent. The liability of a company to pay rent and/or occupation charges and/or rates and taxes does not automatically come to an end with the of winding up of the company. **** **** **** F The dispute between the Official Liquidator and the applicant is with regard to the rates and taxes for the period between 10th July, 1997 being the date on which the company was directed to be wound-up and 4th July, 2003 being the date on which the sale in favour of the purchaser was confirmed. In other words, the G dispute is with regard to the taxes claimed for a period of approximately six years. The Official Liquidator has rejected the proof of debt on his interpretation of the various provisions of the Companies Act and H 1090 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A the Company (Court) Rules framed thereunder and in particular Section 528, 529A and 530 and Rule 154 of the Rules. **** **** **** The contention on behalf of the Official Liquidator, that debts and claims and particularly claims on account of municipal tax are B payable only till the date of winding up of the company, in view of Section 530 of the Companies Act, 1956, read with Rule 154 of the Companies (Court) Rules 1959, is patently misconceived.
