He did not supply any plans for approval; nor did he ever show inclination to procure the needed machinery and equipment required for his proposed industrial unit. Other D steps such as securing tax registration, etc., too were not shown to have been done. Thus, the appellant was always insincere and perhaps never intended to follow up and set up the industrial project, which he proposed to HSIDC, as the basis for allotment of his plot.

SCR 277– referred to. 1.2 The idea behind development of industrial plots and allotting them to deserving applicants is to act as a catalyst to F promote economic growth. In the present case, the facts are stark; the appellant never made any genuine effort to start its unit. There is no material to disclose that upon receipt of no less than three show cause notices, the appellant showed any sense of urgency in taking steps to live up to the bargain, (of setting up an industrial unit). The inference which this court is left to draw, G is that the allottee’s intention was perhaps never to set up any industrial unit, despite its promise to the contrary, and speculatively deal with the plot. Having regard to these facts and circumstances, the court is of the opinion that the impugned does not call for interference. In view of the above conclusions, H 132 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A this court would have been justified in holding that the appellant is only entitled to refund of the sum of 1,66,425/- which was paid for the plot. However, there is no denial of the fact that the cheque issued to him was returned and HSIDC had the benefit of those monies all these years. In these circumstances, HSIDC to refund the sum of 1,66,425/- with interest at 6% p.a. from B 18.09.1998 till date.
