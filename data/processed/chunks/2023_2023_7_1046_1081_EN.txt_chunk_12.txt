What therefore, was held was that the amendment, brought into force from 2001, to the effect that chewing tobacco did not include and never included pan masala containing tobacco, and but for the inclusion of ‘pan masala containing F tobacco’ in Chapter 24 (Heading 2404.49) with effect from 2001, they were goods separately covered under another class altogether, i.e. Heading number 21.06.

The authorities, under the UPTT Act ruled that 10% tax was leviable on sale of gutkha which was treated as an ‘unclassified item’. Section 3 under the UPTT Act, imposes the levy of trade tax on the sale by registered dealers, of various articles. Section 4 of the Act empowers the state to exempt articles from the B levy; the relevant part of that provision, reads as follows: “Section 4 – Exemption from tax shall be payable on (a) the sale or purchase of water, milk, salt excluding processed and branded salt, newspapers, or any other goods which the State Government may, by notification, exempt.” C 26.

Cigars, cigarettes, biris (both machine made and hand- made) and tobacco in any form whether cured and uncured and whether manufactured or not, including the leaf, stalk and stems of the tobacco plant and all products of tobacco, excluding pan masala containing tobacco but including any G part of the tobacco plant while still attached to the earth.” 28.
