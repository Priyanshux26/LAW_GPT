Union of India and Ors. an interim directing the SBC to admit the petitioners on the State roll by accepting Rupees seven hundred fifty as enrolment fees. 74. Given the above background, two issues arise for consideration: (i) whether the miscellaneous fees which are charged in addition to the enrolment fee at the time of enrolment can be considered as enrolment fee; and (ii) whether the SBCs or the BCI can charge miscellaneous fees as a pre-condition for enrolment. i. Charges other than the enrolment fee cannot be a valid pre-condition 75. Section 24(1) of the Advocates Act lays down the conditions subject to which an advocate may be admitted on a State roll. Section 24(1) (f) provides that the enrolment fee is paid by the advocate “in respect of the enrolment.” The use of the phrase “in respect of the enrolment” conveys that the fee is paid for the entire enrolment process. Under the Advocates Act, the process of enrolment commences when an applicant makes an application to the SBC within whose jurisdiction the applicant proposes to practice. Thereafter, the enrolment committee of the SBC scrutinizes the application on the basis of the eligibility qualifications laid down under Section 24(1). The name of an applicant who is found eligible is entered on the roll of advocates and a certificate of enrolment is issued to the applicant by the SBC. The enrolment fee prescribed under Section 24(1)(f) comprehends the whole enrolment process. 76.
