[2024] 2 S.C.R. 391 : 2024 INSC 124 Kalinga @ Kushal v. State of Karnataka By Police Inspector Hubli (Criminal Appeal No. 622 of 2013) 20 February 2024 [Bela M. Trivedi and Satish Chandra Sharma,* JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the extra judicial confession of the appellant-accused was admissible, credible and sufficient for his conviction thereon for the murder of his brother-PW-1’s son; whether the testimony of PW-1 could be termed as reliable and trustworthy and; whether the chain of circumstantial evidence was complete and consistent for arriving at the conclusion of guilt. Headnotes Evidence – Extra judicial confession – Evidentiary value – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Trial Court acquitted all the accused persons – Appeal against acquittal – High Court reversed the acquittal of the appellant and convicted him largely based on the extra judicial confession allegedly made by him before PW-1 – Correctness: Held: Extra judicial confession is a weak type of evidence and is generally used as a corroborative link to lend credibility to the other evidence on record – It must be accepted with great care and caution – If it is not supported by other evidence on record, it fails to inspire confidence and shall not be treated as a strong piece of evidence for the purpose of arriving at the conclusion of guilt – The extent of acceptability of an extra judicial confession depends on the trustworthiness of the witness before whom it is given and the circumstances in which it was given – Prosecution must establish that a confession was indeed made by the accused, it was voluntary in nature and the contents of the confession were true – In the present case, the extra judicial confession is essentially based on the deposition of PW-1, the father of the deceased whose testimony is fatal to the prosecution case on multiple parameters – The doubtful existence of the extra * Author 392 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports judicial confession, unnatural prior and subsequent conduct of PW-1, recovery of dead body in the presence of an unreliable witness PW-2, contradictions regarding arrest, testimony of the witnesses in support of the last seen theory etc. are some of the inconsistencies which strike at the root of the prosecution case – There exist serious doubts regarding the identity of the dead body recovered from the well – Testimony of PW-1 not trustworthy and reliable – Evidence on record fails the test laid down for the acceptability of circumstantial evidence – Trial Court appreciated the evidence in a comprehensive sense, High Court reversed the view without arriving at any finding of perversity or illegality therein – It took a cursory view of the matter and merely arrived at a different conclusion on re-appreciation of evidence – Anomaly of having two reasonably possible views in a matter is to be resolved in favour of the accused – After acquittal, the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused gets reinforced – High Court erred in reversing the acquittal – Impugned set aside – of Trial Court restored, appellant acquitted.
