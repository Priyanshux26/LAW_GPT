88. Mr. Vijay Hansaria, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for another set of petitioners, relied upon the constitutional scheme under Article 6(b)(ii) to argue that to be able to seek the benefit of citizenship under Article 6,68 a person migrating to India from Pakistan after 19.07.1948 had to make an application before the commencement of the Constitution. Thus, the scheme of Section 6A, in the absence of a temporal-limit on its functioning and the sole onus of detection on the state, marks a departure from the prevalent statutory scheme and leads to absurd consequences. Mr. Hansaria further submitted that the benefit of Section 6A should only be limited to the 32,381 67 2.

Rights of citizenship of certain persons who have migrated to India from Pakistan.— Notwithstanding anything in article 5, a person who has migrated to the territory of India from the territory now included in Pakistan shall be deemed to be a citizen of India at the commencement of this Constitution if— (a) he or either of his parents or any of his grand-parents was born in India as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935 (as originally enacted); and (b) (i) in the case where such person has so migrated before the nineteenth day of July, 1948, he has been ordinarily resident in the territory of India since the date of his migration, or (ii) in the case where such person has so migrated on or after the nineteenth day of July, 1948, he has been registered as a citizen of India by an officer appointed in that behalf by the Government of the Dominion of India on an application made by him therefor to such officer before the commencement of this Constitution in the form and manner prescribed by that Government: Provided that no person shall be so registered unless he has been resident in the territory of India for at least six months immediately preceding the date of his application.
