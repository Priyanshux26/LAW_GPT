However, we agree with the submission raised on behalf of K.P. Murali and S.P. Duraisamy, that the aforesaid time, as fi xed vide the agreement to sell and the endorsement (Exhibit A-1 and A-3), was not the essence of the contract and therefore, the fi rst part of Article 54 will not be applicable.10 Instead, the second part of Article 54 will apply.11 On the interpretation of Article 54, this Court in Pachanan Dhara and Others v. Monmatha Nath Maity12 , has held that for determining applicability of the fi rst or the second part, the court will have to see whether any time was fi xed for performance of the agreement to sell and if so fi xed, whether the suit was fi led beyond the prescribed period, unless a case for extension of time or performance was pleaded or established. However, when no time is fi xed for performance, the court will have to determine the date on which the plaintiff had notice of refusal on part of the defendant to perform the contract. Therefore, we have to examine whether K. Sriram or his assignees, K.P. Murali or S.P. Duraisamy, had notice that performance had been refused by A. Valliammai and, if so, from which date. 22. We have elaborately referred to the correspondence exchanged between the parties, namely, notice dated 11.07.1991 (Exhibit A-6), reply dated 09.08.1991 (Exhibit A-7), rejoinder dated 31.08.1991 (Exhibit S-13) and reply to the rejoinder dated 16.09.1991 (Exhibit S-14). We have also referred to the written statement fi led by A. Valliammai. These are admitted documentary evidence and the contents thereof are not in debate. In our opinion, K. Sriram, in the notice dated 11.07.1991 (Exhibit A-6) and rejoinder notice dated 31.08.1991 (Exhibit S-13), had acknowledged having notice that A. Valliammai had refused to perform her part of the contract. K. Sriram fi led a suit for permanent injunction on 15.07.1991 to restrain A. Valliammai from selling the Suit Property to third parties. In the plaint, there is a specifi c averment and statement that A. Valliammai was making excuses and going back on the terms previously agreed. A. Valliammai was negotiating with third parties for sale of the Suit Property. She was not abiding by the statement made before the Tiruverumbur Panchayat Union. K. 10 Supra Note 8. 11 Supra Note 8. 12 (2006) 5 SCC 340. A. VALLIAMMAI v. K.P. MURALI AND OTHERS 193 [SANJIV KHANNA, J.] Sriram had averred that he was going to fi le a suit for specifi c performance in a short time, and he was awaiting reply from A. Valliammai. The reply dated 09.08.1991 (Exhibit A-7) and rejoinder dated 16.09.1991 (Exhibit S-14) by A. Valliammai did not change the situation. These are written notices of refusal and not of acceptance of any obligation and affi rmation. K. Sriram did not withdraw the suit for permanent injunction on the ground that he was satisfi ed with the reply and stand of A. Valliammai and hence the cause of action did not survive.
