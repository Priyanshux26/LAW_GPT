[Para 7][100-E-F] E CIT Patiala vs. Piara Singh, 1980 Supp SCC 166 : [1980] SCR 1122 – held inapplicable. Chuharmal v. CIT, (1988) 3 SCC 588 : [1988] 3 SCR 788; CIT v. K Chinnathamban, (2007) 7 SCC 390 : [2007] 8 SCR 496; TA Quereshi (Dr.) v. CIT, (2007) 2 F SCC 759 : [2006] 10 Suppl. SCR 311; Apex Laboratories (P) Ltd. v. CIT, (2022) 7 SCC 98 – referred to. Per M.M. Sundresh, J. (Supplementing) 1.1 Explanation-I makes a declaration to remove any G possible doubts to reckon a loss suffered in the form of expenditure for any purpose which is an offence or one that is prohibited by law. There is no difficulty in holding that this explanation is clarificatory in nature. Applying the principle of literal interpretation with the intendment being very clear, giving H 88 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A no room for further doubts, coupled with the fact that there is no challenge to it, the meaning appears to be rather very clear. It seeks to prohibit a deduction of any expenditure incurred by an assessee for any purpose which is an offence or which is prohibited by law. Due regard will have to be given to the words ‘any expenditure’ and ‘any purpose’. The reiteration being a legislative B clarification of the main provision is required to be taken note of, as such, the power of judicial review over an explanation, which has been introduced to explain and remove the doubts of the main provision, is rather limited. [Para 12][103-G-H; 104-A-B] 1.2 Though the provision speaks of expenditure while not C making a specific reference to loss, one has to press into service the accepted commercial practice and trading principles. If one is to treat the expenditure as a genus, a loss would become a specie. All losses would become expenditures but not vice versa. A commercial loss in trade arising out of a business being carried D on and incidental to it would be a deductible loss. There is a similarity in the test qua a loss as laid down by this Court, and expenditure under Section 37 of the Act. Perhaps, there is a distinction when it comes to the accounting treatment of the two concepts. Thus, there is no difficulty in holding that the word ‘any expenditure’ mentioned in Section 37 of the Act takes in its E sweep loss occasioned in the course of business, as well. Therefore, I agree with the view of my learned brother that Section 37 of the Act and Explanation 1 will have a bearing in the present case. [Para 13][104-C-E] Badridas Daga v. CIT, [1959] SCR 690 – relied on. F 1.3 A little bit of interplay between Section 115BBE and Section 37(1) of the Act might throw more light on both the provisions. If a loss in pursuance to an offence or prohibited business cannot be brought under Section 115BBE of the Act for income assessed under 68, 69 and 69A to 69D of the Act, which G deals with unexplained income, expenditure etc., it can never be said that the same would be brought under Section 37(1) of the Act, despite the fact that the objective behind both the provisions are overlapping with some connection.
