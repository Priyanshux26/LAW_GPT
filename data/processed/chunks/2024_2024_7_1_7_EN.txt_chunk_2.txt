The learned counsel relied upon a 4 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports decision of this Court in the case of State of Himachal Pradesh and Another v. Himachal Techno Engineers and Another1. 4. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent supported the findings recorded by the High Court. He submitted that in any event, the benefit of Section 4 of the Limitation Act is available only if the proceedings are filed within the prescribed period of limitation, which will be three months in this case in terms of Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. The learned counsel relied upon a decision made by this court in the case of Assam Urban Water Supply & Sewerage Board v Subash Projects & Mktg. Ltd.2. He also invited our attention to a decision of this Court in the case of Union of India v. Popular Construction Company 3. He submitted that, as held by this Court in the said decision, the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act is excluded in view of the language used in the proviso to sub- section (3) of Section 34. OUR VIEW 5. The facts are undisputed. The award made by the Arbitral Tribunal on 30th June 2022 was served upon the appellant on the same day. Between 1st October 2022 and 30th October 2022 (both days inclusive), the High Court was closed for pooja vacation. The petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was filed on 31st October 2022. 6. The period of limitation for filing a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is governed by sub-section (3) of Section 34. Sub- section (3) of Section 34 reads thus: “(3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application 1 [2010] 8 SCR 1025 : (2010) 12 SCC 210 2 [2012] 1 SCR 403 : (2012) 2 SCC 624 3 [2001] Supp. 3 SCR 619 : (2001) 8 SCC 470 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 5 The State of West Bengal represented through the Secretary & Ors. v. Rajpath Contractors and Engineers Ltd. within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.” 7. As per Section 12(1) of the Limitation Act, the day from which the limitation period is to be reckoned must be excluded. In this case, the period of limitation for filing a petition under Section 34 will have to be reckoned from 30th June 2022, when the appellants received the award. In view of Section 12(1) of the Limitation Act, 30th June 2022 will have to be excluded while computing the limitation period.
