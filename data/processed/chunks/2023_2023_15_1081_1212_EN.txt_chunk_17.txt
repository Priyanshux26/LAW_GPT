C*. Maintainability 22. We address the preliminary issue of the maintainability of the present proceedings in this segment. The record of proceedings indicates that notice was issued in the curative petition on 18 July 2023. Subsequently, in Seka Dobric (supra), a three-Judge Bench of this Court while hearing a Section 11 application for the appointment of arbitrators, directed the proceedings to be listed along with the curative petition. On 26 September 2023, the fi ve-Judge Bench diff ered with the view taken in N N Global 2 * Ed. Note: PART C IN RE: INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UNDER 1107 THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT 1996 AND THE INDIAN STAMP ACT 1899 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI ] (supra) and referred the issue to a seven-Judge Bench. Thus, it is important to note that along with the curative petition, a Section 11 petition is also listed before this Court in the present proceedings. 23. The maintenance of judicial discipline is important for ensuring consistency and certainty in the development of law. The rule of judicial discipline demands that a Bench of lower strength is bound by the decision of a larger Bench.14 Judicial discipline also dictates that generally, a Bench of the same strength can question the correctness of a decision rendered by a co-ordinate Bench. In such a situation, the matter is placed before a Bench of larger strength.15 24. However, there have been situations where a Bench of lower strength has diff ered with the decision rendered by a Bench of larger strength. In Union of India v. Hansoli Devi,16 a Bench of two Judges of this Court diff ered with a three-Judge Bench in matter pertaining to the interpretation of the Land Acquisition Act 1894 and referred the matter to a Constitution Bench. The Constitution Bench observed that the reference made by the two-Judge Bench was “improper”. Nevertheless, the Constitution Bench decided to answer the reference “since the questions involved are pending in many cases in diff erent High Courts and certain doubts have arisen with regard to the interpretation to the provisions of Section 28-A of the Act.” In Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community v. State of Maharashtra,17 a Constitution Bench of this Court held that the judicial course adopted in Hansoli Devi (supra) was by way of exception rather than a rule. Therefore, the rule of judicial discipline also has certain well-defi ned exceptions. 25. The respondent has relied on the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in Shilpa Sailesh v. Varun Sreenivasan,18 to submit that there is no live cause or matter to justify the invocation of this Court’s jurisdiction. The issue before the three-Judge Bench in Seka Dobric (supra) pertains to the appointment of an arbitrator at Section 11 stage when the underlying contract is unstamped or insuffi ciently stamped. The Bench directed the 14 Bharat Petroleum Corporation v. Mumbai Shramik Sangha, (2001) 4 SCC 448 15 Pradip Chandra Parija v.
