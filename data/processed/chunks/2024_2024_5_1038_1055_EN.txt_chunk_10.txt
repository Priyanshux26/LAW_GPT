It is canvassed that if the MPM specification is applied, then the capacity of prisons in Uttar Pradesh would increase substantially, with the current infrastructure alone. 40. We may note that perhaps mere existence of a large campus area would not per se mean that the capacity has been enhanced or augmented. What is required to be seen is that whether the requisite facilities for each individual prisoner are adequate in terms of sleeping area, mobility within the prison, kitchen/food, health facilities, other matters etc. 41. Thus, States/UTs, in their proposed affidavits, should address all issues holistically, including inmate-capacity enhancement/ augmentation. Other logistics such as creation of posts of wardens/ cooks/doctors/various jail staff etc. should also be factored in. 42. Before concluding, we may reiterate that prisoners are covered under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. In Sunil Batra (II) v Delhi Administration,6 this Court had pointedly answered that prisoners are persons who are entitled to Fundamental Rights even while in 5 We take it that the reference is to the Uttar Pradesh Jail Manual, 2022. 6 [1980] 2 SCR 557 : (1980) 3 SCC 488 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1055 In Re-Inhuman Conditions In 1382 Prisons custody. Rama Murthy v State of Karnataka,7 was a case where this Court had identified some problems plaguing jails in India, some of which continue to linger till today. Even before these cases, the view of this Court in respect of prisoners and undertrials was exposited in State of Maharashtra v Prabhakar Pandurang Sangzgiri 8 and Mohan Patnaik v State of Andhra Pradesh.9 These are merely illustrative but sufficient to demonstrate the intent of this Court to secure basic facilities for those housed in prisons and were noticed in s/ passed in this writ petition reported as (2016) 3 SCC 700,10 (2016) 10 SCC 17,11 (2017) 10 SCC 658,12 and (2018) 18 SCC 777.13 We expect all stakeholders to rise to the occasion and discharge the obligation cast on them as expeditiously as is possible. 43. The matter be next listed on 11th July, 2024 at the top of the Board. Result of the case: Directions issued. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey 7 (1997) 3 SCC 642 8 [1966] 1 SCR 702 : AIR 1966 SC 424 9 [1975] 2 SCR 24 : (1975) 3 SCC 185 10 dated 05.02.2016. 11 dated 03.10.2016. 12 dated 15.09.2017. 13 dated 25.09.2018.
