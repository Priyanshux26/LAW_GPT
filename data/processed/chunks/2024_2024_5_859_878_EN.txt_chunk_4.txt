The prayer as made, is reproduced below:- “(a) Direct the Respondent to forthwith pay monthly occupational charges at the rate of INR 41/- (Indian Rupees Forty One) per Square feet, for 1208 Sq.ft = INR 49528/- since August, 2007 during the pendency of the present Special Leave Petition in respect of the present lease in dispute…” 12. Certain facts are required to be taken note of. The property in question is situated in the Dalhousie area, which has been termed as a commercial hub in Kolkata. The lease Agreement inter se the parties was entered into on 23rd February 1991 executed by the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioner. It is alleged that the respondent has been in default on payment of rent since 2002 and in default on payment of his share of municipal tax since 1996. 13. On account of non-payment of rent, the lease was forfeited/ determined. However, the respondent has neither delivered the possession of the property nor paid the rent. The petitioner has submitted a report of an independent valuer dated 12th March 2020. The assessment of the rentals, made by the valuer, it is submitted, is fair and reasonable @ INR 41/- per Sq.ft. 14. It is submitted on behalf of the respondent that since no court has declared the end of the landlord-tenant relationship, the petitioner- applicant asking the respondent to pay occupational charges as opposed to contractual rent would amount to the re-writing of the tenancy Agreement. Further, it is argued that occupation charges are only payable after the lease is validly determined or after the decree of eviction. Since both these eventualities are yet to occur, no question of such payment arises. It is also urged that the petitioner-applicant accepted rent from the respondent till August 2002 but thereafter refused to do so. According to the respondent-tenant, a total amount of Rs,2,06,400/- is payable on their part to the petitioner-applicant in the following terms :- 866 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
