The significant aspect is the Proviso to Rule 2 of the 1984 Rules, which specifically stipulated that the period spent on training at the Government Forest College by directly appointed ACF shall not be counted towards the requisite period of service for purposes of D appointment to the cadre of DFO. It is this which is the bedrock of the plea of the private respondents. The respondents also relied on a of this Court on R.S. Ajara & Ors. v. State of Gujarat1 for the proposition that an administrative resolution cannot take away a right crystallized under the service rules. E 11. On the other hand, the appellants’ case before the High Court was that the Proviso to Rule 2 of 1984 Rules stood negated in view of the Government Resolution dated 17.02.1997, wherein the condition of probation period not being considered as period of experience had been removed. It was submitted that Rule 6 of 1998 Rules specified that F persons appointed to the post by nomination shall be on probation for three years including two years of ACF training and one year of field training. There was a marked distinction between 1965 Rules and 1998 Rules, as the former separately referred to recruitment and appointment on probation, whereas the latter referred to appointment on probation for three years, including the period of training. Relying on the same G in the case of R.S. Ajara & Ors.2, it was contended that the training period prior to the appointment can also be considered for the purposes of seniority. 1(1997) 3 SCC 641. 2 (supra). H 908 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A Proceedings before the High Court 12. The High Court passed an interim dated 18.04.2019 restraining the respondent authorities from issuing any promotion based on the of the Tribunal dated 03.02.2016. The above was modified on 23.08.2019 by directing that any promotion made B would be subject to the outcome of the writ petition. 13. The matter was finally adjudicated by the High Court vide the impugned dated 23.04.2021. It was opined that respondent nos. 4 to 9 would not be affected by the Tribunal’s to the extent of directing payment of salary and the pay scale to the appellants from the C date of initiation of the training period, as the respondents’ right would only be affected while considering the seniority vis-à-vis promotion to the post of DFO. Since Rule 3(b) read with Rule 6 of the 1998 Rules shows that the period of training is considered as probation, the direction of the Tribunal to pay salary to them as per the pay scale was found to be reasonable. D 14. However, on the aspect of fixation of seniority, it was opined that the case of R.S. Ajara & Ors.3 was on a factual scenario where, in the absence of rules regarding fixation of seniority of persons appointed to ACF, a Government Resolution was issued suggesting determination of seniority of directly recruited ACF in Gujarat State Forest Services E Class IIby taking into account the period of training.
