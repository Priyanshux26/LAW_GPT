The [2024] 1 S.C.R. 575 Nara Chandrababu Naidu v. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr. concurring view is just as much part of the main opinion (of majority of the judges) and will be a binding precedent, composite with the majority view. The position of law would be different if the majority view had expressed, either directly or by implication, a contrary view. That is not the case so far as the in the case of Yashwant Sinha (supra) is concerned. Hence this principle of law contained in the concurring would constitute precedent even though it was expressed in a concurring of a learned Single Judge which the majority members of the Bench have not differed. Thus, the steps taken against the appellant under the 1988 Act ought to be invalidated as the same did not commence with prior approval as laid down under Section 17A of the 1988 Act. 27. The cases of Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra [AIR 2021 SC 315] and State -vs- M. Maridoss [(2023) 4 SCC 338] were cited by the respondents to contend that investigation ought not be scuttled at a nascent stage and it was also highlighted that the petition for quashing of an FIR was made within five days from the date the appellant was arraigned as an accused. It is a fact that the appellant had approached the quashing Court with extraordinary speed but that factor by itself would not render his action untenable, ousting him from the judicial forum to have the proceeding against him invalidated. In the cases of R.P. Kapur -vs- State of Punjab [AIR 1960 SC 866] and State of Haryana -vs- Bhajan Lal [(1992) Supp. (1) SCC 335], it has been held that prosecution undertaken in violation of a legal bar would be a valid ground for quashment of the proceeding. Further, in the case of Mahmood Ali & others -vs- State of UP [2023 INSC 684] a Coordinate Bench of this Court has observed :- “13.…. The Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC or Article 226 of the Constitution need not restrict itself only to the stage of a case but is empowered to take into account the overall circumstances leading to the initiation/registration of the case as well as the materials collected in the course of investigation.….” 28. Now I shall address the issue as to whether striking down the set of offences under the 1988 Act from the FIR would render the remand passed by the Special Judge appointed in terms of Section 3 of the aforesaid statute illegal and non-est. For the purpose of 576 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports testing this legal issue, which was raised on behalf of the appellant, it would be necessary to refer to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the 1988 Act which have been reproduced above. 29. The question of lack of prior approval under the 1988 Act was raised before the Special Judge at the time of remand but this argument was rejected on the ground that time for commission of the alleged offences related to a period prior to 26.07.2018.
