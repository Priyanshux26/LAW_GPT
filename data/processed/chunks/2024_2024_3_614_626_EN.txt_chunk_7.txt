In such a situation, the question that is often posed before the court is whether such a Police Report could be said to have been submitted in compliance with sub-section (2) of Section 173 Cr.P.C. In this regard, it may be noted that in Satya Narain Musadi & Ors. vs. State of Bihar2, this Court has observed that statutory requirement of the report under Section 173(2) would be complied with if various details prescribed therein are included in the report. The report is complete if it is accompanied with all the documents and statements of witnesses as required by Section 175(5). In Dinesh Dalmia vs. CBI3, however, it has been held that even if all the documents are not filed, by reason thereof the submission of the chargesheet itself would not be vitiated in law. Such issues often arise when the accused would make his claim for default bail under Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C. and contend that all the documents having not been submitted as required under Section 173(5), or the investigation qua some of the persons having been kept open while submitting Police Report under Section 173(2), the requirements under Section 173(2) could not be said to have been complied with. In this regard, this Court recently held in case of CBI vs. Kapil Wadhwan & Anr.4 that: - “Once from the material produced along with the chargesheet, the court is satisfied about the commission of an offence and takes cognizance of the offence allegedly committed by the accused, it is immaterial whether the further investigation in terms of Section 173(8) is pending or not. The pendency of the further investigation qua the other accused or for production of some documents not available at the time of filing of chargesheet would neither vitiate the chargesheet, nor would it entitle the accused to claim right to get default bail on the ground that the chargesheet was an incomplete chargesheet or that the chargesheet was not filed in terms of Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C.” 2 (1980) 3 SCC 152 3 [2007] 9 SCR 1124 : (2007) 8 SCC 770 4 [2024] 1 SCR 677 : Criminal Appeal No. 391 of 2024 (@ SLP (Crl) No. 11775 of 2023) [2024] 3 S.C.R. 625 Dablu Kujur v. The State of Jharkhand 16. The above referred discussion has been necessitated for highlighting the significance of the compliance of requirements of the provisions contained in Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C. 17. Ergo, having regard to the provisions contained in Section 173 it is hereby directed that the Report of police officer on the completion of investigation shall contain the following: - (i) A report in the form prescribed by the State Government stating- (a) the names of the parties; (b) the nature of the information; (c) the names of the persons who appear to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case; (d) whether any offence appears to have been committed and, if so, by whom; (e) whether the accused has been arrested; (f) whether he has been released on his bond and, if so, whether with or without sureties; (g) whether he has been forwarded in custody under section 170.
