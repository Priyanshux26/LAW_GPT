Some judgements have favoured the exclusion of date of remand, while a contrary view is taken in other G cases. 7. The prosecution relies, on the line of reasoning in State of M.P. Vs. Rustam & Ors.2, which was later followed in Ravi Prakash Singh Vs. State of Bihar3 and M. Ravindran Vs. Intelligence Officer, 2 1995 (Supp) 3 SCC 221 H 3 (2015) 8 SCC 340 ENFORCEMENT DIRECTORATE, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA v. 929 KAPIL WADHAWAN & ANR. ETC. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] Director of Revenue Intelligence4, where it was held that the date of A remand is to be excluded for computing the stipulated 60/90 day period, for the right of default bail, to arise. 8. On the other hand, the Accused rely, inter alia, on Chaganti Satyanarayan Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh5, CBI Vs. Anupam J Kulkarni,6 State Vs. Mohd. Ashraft Bhat7 and State of Maharashtra B Vs. Bharati Chandmal Varma,8to contend that the first date of remand must be included for computing the remand period for determining an accused’s entitlement to default bail. 9. Due to the aforementioned conflict in law, a judicial conundrum has arisen which is required to be resolved in this reference. In Chaganti C (supra), this Court while examining the legislative intent, with regard to conclusion of investigation within the statutory remand period, held that the day of remand should be included. On the other hand, the 3- judge bench in M Ravindran (supra), relied on Ravi Prakash (supra), which in turn followed the principle laid down in Rustam (supra) and declared that the date of remand is to be excluded for computing the D mandated 60/90 day period, in to facilitate the accused’s right to default bail. 10. The earlier position of law as declared in Chaganti was ignored in Rustam. And since, Rustam later became the basis for excluding the date of remand from the stipulated period in Ravi Prakash and thereafter E in Ravindran, which is the latest decision of a 3-judge bench, it becomes necessary for a bench of appropriate strength to settle the law taking note of the earlier precedents and the confusion therein. Unless the issue is resolved, there will be a divergence of opinion on how the right to default bail, which is ultimately a fundamental right,9is to be protected. F 11. A two-judge Bench of this Court, on 23.2.2021, noticing the divergence of law on computation of the 60/90 day remand period under proviso (a) of Section 167 (2) of the CrPC, referred the issue to this three-judge Bench. The answer here will facilitate a uniform application of the law on the issue of right to default bail. The reference is being answered as under:- G 4 (2021) 2 SCC 485 5 (1986) 3 SCC 141 6 (1992) 3 SCC 141 7 (1996) 1 SCC 432 8 (2002) 2 SCC 121 9 Gautam Navlakha Vs. National Investigation Agency, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 382 H 930 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A FACTUAL BACKDROP 12.
