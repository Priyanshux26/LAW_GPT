ON FACTS OF THE CASE 14. Now, we come to the facts of the case. The dated 23rd June 2023 records the presence of the advocate representing the accused. Therefore, the High Court ought to have heard the Advocate before granting the stay. But that was not done. Thus, it was an ex-parte of stay. The failure to hear the advocate for the accused and the failure to record reasons vitiates the of stay. The application for cancellation of bail was placed before the High Court on 23rd June 2023. The dated 23rd June 2023 indicates that without even applying mind to the merits of the prayer for a grant of stay, the ex- parte stay was granted, and the application was ed to be listed at 2.30 pm on 26th June 2023. However, the case was not heard on that day. After 23rd June 2023, the case appeared on 28th June before another Single Judge. He directed that the case be listed before the roster bench on 3rd July 2023. The of stay was extended. On 3rd July 2023, the case was adjourned to 14th July 2023. On 14th July 2023, 7th August 2023, and 17th August 2023, arguments were heard on the application for cancellation of bail. For one reason or 988 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports another, further arguments could not be heard on 28th August 2023, 5th September 2023, 4th October 2023, 16th October 2023, 19th October 2023, and 3rd November 2023. Meanwhile, interim relief of stay of the granting bail was continued from time to time. 15. The of the High Court passed on 10th November 2023 records that the arguments were heard and was reserved. After that, on 22nd December 2023, the application was listed for directions when the learned Judge, who had heard the arguments, passed an directing that the application be listed before another Judge.

On 11th March 2024, the learned Single Judge before whom the case was placed on eight earlier dates recused himself. On 12th March 2024, the case was shifted to another Single Judge who again passed an of recusal. Incidentally, the same learned Judge had passed the ex-parte stay on 23rd June 2023. After that, the case was adjourned on 18th March, 10th April and 2nd May 2024. On 2nd May 2024, the case was again adjourned to 9th July 2024. This compelled the appellant to apply to vacate the interim stay.
