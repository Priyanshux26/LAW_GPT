[2024] 6 S.C.R. 259 : 2024 INSC 397 Col. Ramneesh Pal Singh v. Sugandhi Aggarwal (Civil Appeal No. 6137 of 2024) 08 May 2024 [Vikram Nath and Satish Chandra Sharma,* JJ.] Issue for Consideration Matter pertains to the guardianship of two minor children till they attain the age of majority. Headnotes Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 – ss. 7, 9 and 25 – Custody of two minor children – Family Court granted permanent custody of minor children to the father-serving Army Officer and provided visitation rights to the mother – However, the High Court set aside the and granted the parties shared custody of the minor children – Challenge to: Held: Principal consideration whilst deciding an application for guardianship under the Act in exercise of its parens patriae jurisdiction would be the ‘welfare’ of the minor children – Dispute must be decided on the basis of a holistic and all encompassing approach including inter alia the socio economic and educational opportunities made available to the minor children; healthcare and overall well being of the children; the ability to provide physical surroundings conducive to growing adolescents; the preference of the minor children as also stability of surroundings of the minor children – On facts, unwavering and strong desire of the children to continue to reside with the father – Said desire/preference although in itself cannot be determinative of custody of the children, but must be given due consideration – As regards, upbringing and welfare of the minor children, the Indian Armed Forces provides a robust support system to the kin of its officers which undoubtedly, aids in the mental stimulation, growth and overall development of personality of a child – Nothing on record to suggest that the interests and welfare of the minor children were in any manner affected during their stay with the father – Furthermore, the father could not have been said to have engaged or propagated ‘alienating behaviour’ as alleged by the mother – High Court failed to appreciate the said * Author 260 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports nuance and proceeded on an unsubstantiated assumption that allegations of parental alienation could not be ruled out, despite the stark absence of any instances of ‘alienating behaviour’ having been identified by any Court – High Court neither correct nor justified in interfering with the passed by the Family Court – In view thereof, it is just and appropriate that the custody of the minor children is retained by the father, subject to the visitation rights of the mother as granted by the Family Court. [Paras 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 24-27] Child and family welfare – Child custody dispute – ‘Parental alienation syndrome’-PAS – Concept of: Held: ‘Parental alienation syndrome’-PAS is a thoroughly convoluted and intricate phenomenon requiring serious consideration and deliberation – Recognising and appreciating the repercussions of PAS certainly shed light on the realities of longdrawn and bitter custody and divorce litigations on a certain identified sect of families – However, there can be no straitjacket formula to invoke the principle of PAS laid down by this Court in *Vivek Singh’s case – Courts ought not to prematurely and without identification of individual instances of ‘alienating behaviour’, label any parent as propagator and/or potential promoter of such behaviour – Said label has far-reaching implications which must not be imputed or attributed to an individual parent routinely – Courts must endeavour to identify individual instances of ‘alienating behaviour’in to invoke the principle of parental alienation so as to overcome the preference indicated by the minor children.
