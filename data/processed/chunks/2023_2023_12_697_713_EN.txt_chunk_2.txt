(ii) Whether the gift-deed, dated 24.04.1982, was fraudulently obtained from Fathima Beevi and never acted upon? (iii) Whether the sale-deed dated 14.11.1990, executed by Fathima Beevi in favour of plaintiff , valid? (iv) Whether the property described in the second schedule belonged to Fathima Beevi on the basis of a Hiba executed by her father? 6. The trial court held that,-- the property concerned was gifted to Fathima Beevi by her father; the gift-deed dated 24.04.1982 executed by Fathima Beevi in favour of Kaja Mohideen (fi rst defendant’s husband) is invalid; the sale-deed dated 14.11.1990 in favour of the plaintiff is valid; and that the plaintiff is entitled to one-sixth share in the second schedule property. In terms thereof, the suit was decreed for one-sixth share in the suit property. 7. As the trial court found the gift-deed dated 24.04.1982 invalid and sale-deed dated 14.11.1990 valid, the plaintiff fi led a review application (I.A. No. 207 of 2001), inter alia, claiming that the suit ought to have been decreed in its entirety and not for mere one-sixth share. This review application was rejected on merits by the trial court vide dated 20.12.2006. 8. Aggrieved by rejection of the review application, the plaintiff (i.e. the respondent herein) fi led civil revision before the High Court under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short, ‘the CPC’). 9. The High Court entertained the revision and, by the impugned and dated 12.09.2017, allowed it. The High Court not only set aside the of the trial court rejecting I.A. No. 207 of 2001 but it also RAHIMAL BATHU & OTHERS v. ASHIYAL BEEVI 701 [MANOJ MISRA, J.] allowed the review application and modifi ed the decree dated 21.11.1996 in terms prayed for in the review application. In consequence, the decree of the trial court, which was in respect of one-sixth share only in the second schedule property, was extended to the whole of it. The operative portion of the impugned is extracted below: “…consequently, the and decree, dated 21.11.1996, passed in O.S. No. 276 of 1992, on the fi le of the Ist Additional Sub Court, Tirunelveli, are modifi ed to the eff ect that the plaintiff is entitled for declaration that the second schedule property belongs to her absolutely and consequently, she is entitled to recover the possession of the same from the defendants…” 10. Aggrieved by the and of the High Court, the defendants are in appeal. 11. We have heard Mr. A. Sirajudeen, learned senior counsel for the appellants and Mr. V. Prabhakar, learned counsel, for the respondents. Submissions on behalf of the appellants 12. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted: (i) The High Court exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a revision against an which declined review of an appealable decree; (ii) Assuming that the revision was maintainable, High Court could not on its own modify trial court’s decree which was not the subject matter of challenge before the High Court; (iii) If the trial court had committed any jurisdictional error in rejecting the review application, the High Court should have remitted the matter back to the trial court for a fresh consideration of the review application; (iv) If the High Court’s is allowed to stand, defendants’ right of an appeal under Section 96 of the CPC would get aff ected as the trial court’s decree would get merged in the decree modifi ed by the High Court.
