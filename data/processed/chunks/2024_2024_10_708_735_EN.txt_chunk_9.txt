It is despite all such conclusions and finding that the respondents before the first appellate court viz., the appellants herein did not file cross- appeal or cross-objection to challenge the adverse finding that the suit schedule property is not a Joint Hindu Family property before the High Court. Suffice it to say that in the said circumstances the appellants cannot be permitted to canvass that suit schedule property is a Joint Hindu Family Property. 15. That apart, a scanning of the impugned would reveal that the High Court has picked up certain crucial perversities that infected the s of the courts below. In Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words & Phrases, 4th Edn., the expression ‘perverse’ has been defined thus: - [2024] 10 S.C.R. 721 Neelam Gupta & Ors. v. Rajendra Kumar Gupta & Anr. “Perverse. – A perverse verdict may probably be defined as one that is not only against the weight of evidence but is altogether against the evidence. In the decision in Arulvelu & Anr. v. State Rep. by Public Prosecutor & Anr.3 this Court held that ‘perverse finding’ would mean a finding which is not only against the weight of evidence but is altogether against the evidence itself. In the decision in General Manager (P), Punjab & Sind Bank and Others v. Daya Singh,4 this Court held perverse finding as one which is based on no evidence or one that no reasonable person would arrive at. Furthermore, it was held that unless it is found that some relevant evidence had not been considered or that certain inadmissible material had been taken into consideration the finding could not be said to be perverse.” 16. Bearing the aforesaid position as to perverse finding we will proceed to consider whether the impugned is to be sustained in view of the indisputable or undisputed facts and the decisions of precedential value applicable to such situations and circumstances revealed from the evidence on record. Before proceeding to undertake such a consideration it is not inappropriate to refer to the settled positions of law with respect to pleadings in civil proceedings before a civil court. 17. The ordinary rule of law is that evidence can be permitted to be given only on a plea properly raised and not in contradiction of the plea (see the decision in Mrs. Om Prabha Jain v. Abnash Chand & Anr.5). 18. In the decision in Ram Sarup Gupta (dead) by LRs v. Bishun Narain Inter College and Others,6 this Court held: - “….It is well settled that in the absence of pleading, evidence, if any, produced by the parties cannot be 3 [2009] 14 SCR 1081 : (2009) 10 SCC 206 4 [2010] 9 SCR 71 : (2010) 11 SCC 233 5 [1968] 3 SCR 111 : AIR 1968 SC 1083 6 [1987] 2 SCR 805 : (1987) 2 SCC 555 722 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports considered. It is also equally settled that no party should be permitted to travel beyond its pleading and that all necessary and material facts should be pleaded by the party in support of the case set up by it.” 19.
