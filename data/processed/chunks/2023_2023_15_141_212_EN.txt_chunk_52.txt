Nor can there can be any argument that the amendment made in February, 2018, is traceable to Article 246A. On this aspect, this court held in Union of India v Mohit Mineral Pvt. Ltd49. that: “ The expression used in article 246A is ‘power to make laws with respect to goods and service tax’. The power to make law, thus, is not general power related to a general entry rather it specifi cally relates to goods and services tax. When express power is there to make law regarding goods and services tax, we fail to comprehend that how such power shall not include power to levy cess on goods and services tax. True, that the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016 was passed to subsume various taxes, surcharges and cesses into one tax but the constitutional provision does not indicate that henceforth no surcharge or cess shall be levied.” 114. As far as the Maharashtra appeals are concerned, the assessees’ grievance is that the retrospective amendments, made to the Maharashtra VAT Act, were void. On 15.04.2017, the State published Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy, Amendment and Validation) Act 2017 in the Government Gazette thereby amending various provisions of various Acts. In paragraph No. 26 of the MVAT Act, 2002, Sections 6(A), 6(B) and 6(C) were inserted. The eff ect of these was to require a mandatory pre-deposit of 10% of the disputed tax liability. This was challenged, and the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court in Anshul Impex Private Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra50 (hereinafter, “Anshul Impex Private Ltd”) held the amendment inapplicable to a lis which had started in 2011. The state again 49 2018 (13) SCR 139 50 STA No. 2/2018 in a delivered on 28th September, 2018 210 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. amended the enactment, through ordinance i.e. Maharashtra Ordinance No. VI of 2019, published in the Government Gazette on 6th March, 2019. By the Ordinance the State of Maharashtra inserted an explanation w.e.f. 15th April 2017. According to the state, the explanation was inserted for the purpose of removal of doubts, in view of the of Nagpur Bench of the court in Anshul Impex Private Ltd. (supra). On 9th July 2019, the Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy, Amendment and Validation) Act 2019 was enacted. It was published in the Government Gazette on 9th July 2019. The Ordinance was replaced by the enactment of the State Legislature inserting various provisions including the said explanation to Section 26 (6C) of the MVAT Act, 2002. The explanation had the eff ect of clarifying that the pre-deposit requirements applied to pre-2017 appeals and revisions. This was challenged. The High Court, by a Full Bench ruling51 upheld the amendment. It was held that “The State Government has legislative competence to remove the substratum of foundation of a retrospectively. The State Government is empowered to carry out amendment suitably to amend the law by use of appropriate phraseology removing the defects pointed out by the Court in any and by amending the law inconsistent with the law declared by the Court so that the defects which were pointed out were never on the statute for eff ective enforcement of law.
