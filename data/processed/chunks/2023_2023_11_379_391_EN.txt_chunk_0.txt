[2023] 11 S.C.R. 379 : 2023 INSC 760 CASE DETAILS M/S OM GURUSAI CONSTRUCTION COMPANY v. M/S V.N. REDDY & ORS. (Civil Appeal No. 5375 of 2023) AUGUST 23, 2023 [J. K. MAHESHWARI AND K. V. VISWANATHAN, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Under Clause 2.22.0 (ix) of tender conditions, the appellant was to furnish the additional performance security within a period of two working days and this duration of two days was not to be relaxed under any circumstances, whether to construe clause 2.22.0(ix) as rigid and unalterable, even if the justice of the cause warranted otherwise. Tender – The tendering authority had accepted the additional performance security on 17.03.2021 i.e. after a period of two working days – Propriety: Held: Under Clause 2.22.0 (ix), the appellant was to furnish the additional performance security within a period of two working days – It is not disputed that 13.03.2021 was a Saturday and 14.03.2021 was a Sunday and hence two working days would expire only on 16.03.3021 – It is also not disputed that there was a nationwide employees strike in the nationalised banks on 15.03.2021 and 16.03.2021 – Finally, additional performance security was accepted on 17.03.2021 – This is a case where the appellant has complied with the condition of furnishing the additional performance security at the earliest possible time, that it could possibly comply – That no one can be compelled to perform an impossible task - Lex non cogit ad impossibilia - is a well-accepted legal principle – Decision making authorities, like the tendering authority here, cannot be expected to turn a blind eye to undisputed – ground realities and compelling necessities, like the one that presented itself here – Thus, there is no hesitation in holding that the deposit of the additional performance security on 17.03.2021 was in due compliance of Clause 2.22.0 (ix) of the tender conditions – There was no breach of that clause.
