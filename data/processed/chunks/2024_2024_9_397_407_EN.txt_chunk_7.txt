However, a letter dated 27th April 2017 (annexure P-3) addressed by Deputy Civil Surgeon Rewari to Deputy Civil Surgeon Gurugram records that the team comprised four members, and the raid was conducted by the said four members. 16. A perusal of the impugned FIR and impugned complaint shows that its foundation is the material seized during the raid on 27th April 2017. Except for what was found in the search and the seized documents, there is nothing to connect the accused with the offence punishable under Section 23 of the 1994 Act. As the search itself is entirely illegal, continuing prosecution based on such an illegal search will amount to abuse of the process of law. The High Court ought to have noticed the illegality we have pointed out. 17. Therefore, the appeal is allowed, and the impugned dated 13th January 2023 is set aside. FIR No.408, dated 27th April 2017, registered in the Police Station, Gurugram at Gurugram, is hereby quashed. The complaint bearing no. COMA No.40 of 2018, pending before the court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurugram, also stands quashed. Result of the Case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
