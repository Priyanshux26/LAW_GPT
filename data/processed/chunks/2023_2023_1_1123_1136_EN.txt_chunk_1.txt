Firstly, the dimensions of the Concerned Goods make it illogical and unviable for daily transit. While it is true that classification of the goods must not be usually made on the advertisement material of the manufacturer, the user guides produced before this Court showcase that placing the product in other than the specified orientation could lead to damage to the E Concerned Goods. The user guides also emphatically highlight that the Concerned Goods were meant to be used at a fixed place and contained specifications that made them ideal for being mounted on a wall. Secondly, the inability of the consumer to carry these goods around in the absence of any protective case or any F covering bags, which makes the Concerned Goods vulnerable to damage during transit. As noted in the literature relied upon before this Court, the weight was not the sole consideration for being considered as ‘portable’. For example, there used to be computers which are now no longer in common use which were popularly known as ‘luggable’. They used to weigh more than 10 G kilograms. These old predecessors of laptops were designed at the relevant time to be portable and used to fold up neatly in one box with a handle. Despite their weight and the size comparable to small suitcase, they could still be transported, albeit without a wagon. [Paras 19 and 20][1134-E-H; 1135-A] H HEWLETT PACKARD INDIA SALES PVT. LTD. v. COMMISSIONER 1125 OF CUSTOMS (IMPORT), NHAVA SHEVA 3. Keeping in view the applicable understanding of the A element of ‘portable’ as understood in common parlance used in the trade of ADPs, this Court must hold that the Concerned Goods are not portable for the reasons that-Firstly, the diagonal dimension of the Concerned Goods being minimum of the length of 18.5 inches and the same needs to be transported along with B the power cable as well as the applicable stand in most cases if it is to be mounted and; secondly there being no protective case designed by the markets for daily transport for these Concerned Goods. Such requirements make the Concerned Goods unable to be carried around easily during daily transit. This, thus, hold that the Concerned Goods are not ‘portable’. [Para 22][1135-D- C F] 4. It goes without saying that since the customs authorities wanted to classify the goods differently, the burden of proof to showcase the same was on them, which they failed to discharge. Hence under the prevalent self-assessment procedure, the D classification submitted by the appellants must be accepted. [Para 23][1135-F-G] CCE v Krishna Carbon Paper Co.
