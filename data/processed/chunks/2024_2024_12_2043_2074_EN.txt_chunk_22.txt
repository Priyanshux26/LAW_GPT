We may note here that in Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No.19 of 2021 by the dated 19th January 2021, the NCLAT, while deciding the challenge to the Resolution Plan, noted that the application challenging the status of the appeals made by the 1st respondent-Doha Bank was pending. The NCLAT observed that the Resolution Plan was rightly approved, subject to the disposal of the pending application. In fact, in paragraph 7, the NCLAT observed that depending upon the outcome of the applications, if the Resolution Plan requires to be reconsidered, the adjudicating authority will do so after hearing the parties. This has become final. 67. As we have accepted the main contention of the appellants, the alternative contention of the appellants becoming secured creditors is not gone into. CONCLUSION 68. The sum and substance of the above discussion is that the impugned and dated 9th September 2022 passed by the NCLAT cannot be sustained, and the dated 2nd March 2021 of the NCLT deserves to be upheld. Accordingly, the impugned of the NCLAT is quashed and set aside, and the dated 2nd March 2021 passed by the NCLT, Mumbai Bench (adjudicating authority) is restored. The appeals are, accordingly, allowed. Result of the Case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
