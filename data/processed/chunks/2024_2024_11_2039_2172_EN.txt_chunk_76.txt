143. The Lender’s Affidavit in precise terms stated that “Failing to comply with the conditions mentioned in Para 8(a) to (c) above, the Corporate Debtor should be directed to go into liquidation”. It was in this context that this Court stated that, “the SRA shall peremptorily on or before 31 January 2024, deposit an amount of Rs. 150 crores into the designated account of SBI, failing which the consequences under the Resolution Plan will follow”. Therefore, it is incorrect to contend that this Court neither considered nor expressed any opinion on the question of liquidation of the Corporate Debtor. The consequence of non-implementation of the Resolution Plan by the SRA must necessarily be liquidation of the Corporate Debtor in accordance with Section 33(3) of the IBC, 2016. Section 33(3) of the IBC, 2016 reads as thus: “(3) Where the resolution plan approved by the Adjudicating Authority is contravened by the concerned corporate debtor, any person other than the corporate debtor, whose interests are prejudicially affected by such contravention, [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2149 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. may make an application to the Adjudicating Authority for a liquidation as referred to in sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of clause (b) of sub-section (1).” (emphasis supplied) 144. The non-deposit of Rs. 150 Crore had in fact lead to a failure of the Resolution Plan on several counts as elaborated herein. In addition to the breach of Clauses 6.3.1(g), 6.4.4 and S. No. 11 of the Implementation Schedule under Clause 7.7, the non-infusion of the first tranche payment in accordance with the terms of the Resolution Plan has also led to an infraction as regards Clause 6.4.1 on the payment of CIRP costs and Clause 6.4.2 on the payment of workmen/employees’ dues. Further, the payment of the Provident Fund and Gratuity dues of the workmen/Employees as mandated by the dated 21.10.2022 of the NCLAT which was confirmed by this Court on 31.01.2023, has also not been made by the SRA. 145. The SRA was given multiple extensions, post the Effective Date i.e., 20.05.2022 in to implement the Resolution Plan and infuse the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore into the Corporate Debtor. This includes the extensions granted by (a) the NCLT vide dated 13.01.2023, by which the timeline for infusion of the first tranche payment was extended till 15.05.2023; (b) the NCLAT vide dated 26.05.2023, where the timeline of 180 days was further extended up to 31.08.2023; (c) the NCLAT vide dated 28.08.2023, where the timeline of 180 days was extended up to 30.09.2023; and (d) this Court vide dated 18.01.2024, whereby the time of 180 days for infusion was extended up to 31.01.2024. However, indisputably, there has been a failure on the part of the SRA to abide by all these extended timelines as well. No further extensions or accommodations can be given to the SRA in light of the multiple opportunities already granted as aforesaid.
