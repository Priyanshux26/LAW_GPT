29 2015 (3) SCR997 174 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 54. It was argued that the Telangana Ordinance was issued with eff ect from 17.6.2017. However, Section 7 of the Telangana Amendment Act clearly repealed the Ordinance without any savings clause. Further, under Section 1(2) the Telangana Amendment Act was deemed to retrospectively come into eff ect from 17.6.2017. Thus, the Telangana Amendment clearly intended to obliterate the Ordinance altogether and not merely continue the law. Thus, all submissions to the eff ect that the issuance of the Ordinance and its incorporation into an enactment constitutes a single law making power being exercised akin to a principal ratifying an agent’s actions are belied by the very provisions of the State Amendment. 55. Thus, the lack of legislative competence is immediate. That is not the subject matter of Section 19. Instead, what is kept in suspension under Section 19, is the eff ect of such incompetence on enactments that had already been passed prior to the Amendment, i.e., enactments in force. Section 19 is pari materia to Article 243 ZF and must be given the above interpretation in accordance with Bondu Ramaswamy v. Bangalore Development Authority30 (hereafter, “Bondu Ramaswamy”) Further, the words “shall come into force” in Section 1(2) will have no meaning if Section 19 is interpreted to mean that the operation of the Amendment itself is to be stayed for a period of one year. 56. Counsel stated that a transitional provision cannot be used for oblique purposes. The scope of a power to ‘amend’ a statute is co-terminus with the scope of legislative competence and cannot travel beyond such Competence as on the date of such amendment. With eff ect from 16.09.2016, and therefore, as on o 17.06.2017, the competence of the State Legislature to make law with respect to Article 246(3) read with unamended Entry 54 did not exist. The word ‘amend’ in Section 9 therefore cannot be read to be wider than the competence of the State Legislature on 17.06.2017. Instead, the word ‘amend’ is limited to the power to make law only with respect to the new contours of Entry 54.The term ‘until’ indicates that the lifetime of an inconsistent law is immediately decided by Section 19. An inconsistent law continues to be in force until: 30 (2010) 6 SCR29 THE STATE OF TELANGANA & ORS. v. M/S TIRUMALA 175 CONSTRUCTIONS [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] a. The State legislature amends the inconsistent law to bring it in conformity with the Constitution as amended by the 101stAmendment OR b. The State Legislature repeals the inconsistent law OR c. The period of one year from the commencement of the Act expires i.e., 15.09.2017. 57. The purpose of using the word ‘amend’ is to allow the State Legislature to bring existing laws in conformity with the 101st Constitution Amendment so that they can continue to operate. If the legislatures chooses to take such a route, the inconsistent provisions of the Act cease to exist upon amendment. In the language of Section 19 - until it was amended.
