A reference was also made to Prafulla Kumar Swain v. Prakash Chandra Misra & Ors.,4 where Regulation 12(c) of the Orissa Forest Services Class II Recruitment Rules, 1959 provided that appointment to service is to commence only after successful completion of training, and hence the seniority would be reckoned from the date of appointment and not date F of recruitment. No such similar Government Resolution or Regulation providing for fixation of seniority existed in the present matter. 15. The reasoning of the High Court was based on the 1984 Rules which were framed under the Proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution and have statutory force. On the other hand, the Government Resolution G dated 17.02.1997 was issued under Article 162 of the Constitution by General Administration Department of Government of Maharashtra and hence does not have an overriding effect upon the 1984 Rules. While 3 (Supra). H 4 1993 Supp (3) SCC 181. ASHOK RAM PARHAD & ORS. v. THE STATE OF 909 MAHARASHTRA & ORS. [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] the said Resolution provides that probation period shall be considered A for purposes of experience, the 1984 Rules require the period spent on probation and/or training to be excluded and only the period after appointment on successful completion of training and/or probation to be computed for purposes of promotion to the post of DFO. 16. Even on examination of 1998 Rules, the High Court came to B the same conclusion. Even though the said Rules prescribed fixation of seniority amongst persons appointed by nomination, their seniority is not fixed unless and until they pass the final examination of the ACF training course. Thus, Rule 6 of 1998 Rules was found to be in consonance with Rule 3(b) of the 1998 Rules where the Commission selects candidates C for the ACF training course and only after successful completion of training and passing the competitive final examination, would the candidates be issued the appointment of ACF. It was observed that Rule 7 of 1998 Rules only prescribed the methodology of fixation of inter se seniority of the ACF appointed by nomination and does not provide for fixation of seniority between those appointed by promotion D and nomination. The High Court thus held that the seniority of persons selected for the post of ACF by nomination shall be counted from the date of issuance of appointment after successful completion of training qua the person appointed to ACF by promotion.
