Learned ASG relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Gurwinder Singh v. State of Punjab and Another.2 This Court extensively considered its earlier decision in the case of National Investigation Agency v. Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali,3 which deals with interpretation of Section 43D(5). Paragraph 32 of the said decision reads thus: 2 [2024] 2 SCR 134 : (2024) 5 SCC 403 3 [2019] 5 SCR 1060 : (2019) 5 SCC 1 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 643 Jalaluddin Khan v. Union of India “32. In this regard, we need to look no further than Watali case [NIA v. Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, (2019) 5 SCC 1 : (2019) 2 SCC (Cri) 383] which has laid down elaborate guidelines on the approach that courts must partake in, in their application of the bail limitations under the UAP Act. On a perusal of paras 23 to 24 and 26 to 27, the following 8-point propositions emerge and they are summarised as follows: 32.1.Meaning of “prima facie true” : On the face of it, the materials must show the complicity of the accused in commission of the offence. The materials/evidence must be good and sufficient to establish a given fact or chain of facts constituting the stated offence, unless rebutted or contradicted by other evidence. 32.2. Degree of satisfaction at pre charge-sheet, post charge-sheet and post-charges — compared : “26. … once charges are framed, it would be safe to assume that a very strong suspicion was founded upon the materials before the Court, which prompted the Court to form a presumptive opinion as to the existence of the factual ingredients constituting the offence alleged against the accused, to justify the framing of charge. In that situation, the accused may have to undertake an arduous task to satisfy the Court that despite the framing of charge, the materials presented along with the charge-sheet (report under Section 173 of CrPC), do not make out reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against him is prima facie true. Similar opinion is required to be formed by the Court whilst considering the prayer for bail, made after filing of the first report made under Section 173 of the Code, as in the present case.” 32.3. Reasoning, necessary but no detailed evaluation of evidence : “24. … the exercise to be undertaken by the Court at this stage—of giving reasons for grant or non-grant of bail—is markedly different from discussing merits or demerits of 644 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the evidence. The elaborate examination or dissection of the evidence is not required to be done at this stage.” 32.4. Record a finding on broad probabilities, not based on proof beyond doubt : “The Court is merely expected to record a finding on the basis of broad probabilities regarding the involvement of the accused in the commission of the stated offence or otherwise.” 32.5. Duration of the limitation under Section 43-D(5) : “26. … the special provision, Section 43-D of the 1967 Act, applies right from the stage of registration of FIR for the offences under Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act until the conclusion of the trial thereof.” 32.6.
