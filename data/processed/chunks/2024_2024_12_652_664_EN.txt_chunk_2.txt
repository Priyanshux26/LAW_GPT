Supreme Court Reports 6. What is important to note is the FIR does mention material particulars like time of the accident, the place of the accident and also the fact that it was an unknown truck which had hit the car, and about the injuries sustained by the deceased. 7. The claim petition thereafter sets out that after obtaining treatment at Maihar Civil Hospital, Chakradhar Dubey was treated at Nagpur Arneja Institute of Cardiology Private Limited from 19.06.2018 and when he did not recover, he was taken back to Maihar, where he died on 28.06.2018. 8. The claimant widow further avers that since she was busy with the treatment and thereafter due to the death, the programs relating thereto, she was not perfectly fit mentally to obtain particulars and file a claim. The claimant widow states that on being physically fit, she started collecting information about the incident. She came to know that the accident was caused due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 2 who drove the truck of respondent no. 3.
