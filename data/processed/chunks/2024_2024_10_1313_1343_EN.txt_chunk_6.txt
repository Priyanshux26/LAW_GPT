Our discussion will also address the arguments raised by both sides, with particular focus on the contention of the respondents that the court depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Amarendra Kumar Singh (PW-10) and Rama Devi (PW-24) should not be accepted. 10. At the outset, we express our agreement with the reasoning given by the High Court for disbelieving the presence of Shashi Bhushan [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1323 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others Singh (PW-42) at the spot, and consequently, his deposition as an eye-witness for the following reasons: (i) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is not mentioned as one of the persons present at the place of occurrence in the fardbeyan (Exhibit-50), as also in the FIR (Exhibits 51 and 51/1). These documents name the eyewitnesses. Therefore, the absence of the name of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is significant. (ii) His statement under Section 161 CrPC was recorded on 18.06.1998, i.e., 5 days after the date of occurrence; (iii) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) has deposed about taking the dead body of Brij Bihari Prasad on 14.06.1998 from Patna to Behihari village, the native place of Brij Bihari Prasad. Therefore, the delay in his Section 161 CrPC statement impairs his assertion of being an eyewitness, making it unworthy of acceptance; (iv) Although Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Rama Devi (PW-24) have testified to the presence of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) as an eyewitness, this assertion should not be accepted. The fardbeyan (Exhibit P-50), being the first written account made immediately after the incident, is unexceptionable. Furthermore, the unexplained delay of five days in recording the statement of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) as an eyewitness dents the credibility of his account. (v) For the same reasons, the reliance of the prosecution on the court testimony of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), averring the presence of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) at the place of occurrence, contrary to his fardbeyan, is erratic and untrustworthy. Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), did not entirely support the prosecution case, yet being conscious of the fact that he was the informant of the fardbeyan, he could not completely resile. His dock version about the presence of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) has been rightly disbelieved. Testimony of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) 11. Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) is categoric about his presence in the hospital at about 6:40–7:00 p.m. on 13.06.1998 to visit Brij Bihari Prasad. He named the persons who were present with him in the 1324 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports hospital room, which includes Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25). The testimony captures the following: (i) Brij Bihari Prasad went for a walk along with the people of his constituency and supporters who had come to see him. The police personnel assigned for his protection also accompanied him. (ii) After some time, two vehicles – a white Sumo car (Registration No. BR-1P-1818) and a white Ambassador car – came into the hospital and stopped at a distance of about 20 steps in front of Brij Bihari Prasad.
