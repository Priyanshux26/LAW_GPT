Act. H BIMLA TIWARI v. STATE OF BIHAR & ORS. 505 The basic accusation is of torture for non-fulfill- ment of dowry A demand. It is submitted by learned counsel for the peti- tioner that the petitioner has falsely been implicated in this case. He further submits that a bank draft of Rs.6,00,000/- (six lac) dated B 28.02.2022 bearing draft number 283114 is being handed over to the learned counsel for the informant which is in favour of the informant (Bimla Tiwary). The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the in- formant has accepted the offer of the petitioner and received the aforesaid C bank draft during course of hearing of the case. Considering the aforestated facts, let the petitioner, above named in the event of his arrest or sur- render before the court below within a period of four weeks from today, be released on anticipatory bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs.10,000/- (ten D thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the sat- isfaction of learned Sub Divisional Judicial Magis- trate, Patna Sadar, Patna in connection with Jakkanpur Case No. 346 of 2018, subject to the conditions as laid down under Section 438(2) of the Cr.P.C.” E 15. Thus, it is noticed that these criminal proceedings are being prosecuted only as money recovery proceedings. We have expressed reservations even as regards the aforesaid dated 10.03.2022, wherein the High Court has proceeded on the propositions of offer made F by the co-accused of payment of the sum of Rs.6,00,000/- (six lakhs) and acceptance thereof by the informant (present petitioner). However, since the said is not before us, we would refrain from making any directions in that regard and else, in our view, even the said too, on the proposition of granting bail with reference to payment, has its own shortcomings. G 16. Even when we are not modifying the condition in the said dated 10.03.2022 for the same being not before us, so far as the impugned dated 14.11.2022 is concerned, in our view, it shall be in the interest of justice to annul the requirement of payment of a sum of H 506 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A Rs. 75,000/- (seventy-five thousand) by the accused- respondent No. 2. Hence, the granting pre-arrest bail to the respondents stands affirmed but, the condition therein, of payment of Rs.75,000/- (seventy- five thousand) by the respondent No.2, stands annulled. 17. Subject to the observations and requirements foregoing, these B petitions stand dismissed. 18. All pending applications stand disposed of. Bibhuti Bhushan Bose Petitions disposed of. C D E F G H
