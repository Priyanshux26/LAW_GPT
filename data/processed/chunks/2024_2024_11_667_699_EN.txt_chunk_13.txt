The same should not be utilized to render the commercial wisdom between the parties otiose, which is inherent in drafting such clauses.” 27. To recall, Clause 21 stipulates that the parties of the “first part” are not concerned with the sale consideration as they have already 686 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports received the agreed sale consideration from the parties of the “second part” by an agreement dated 19 March 1994. This Court has interpreted the reference to the agreement dated 19 March 1994 as the agreement between the petitioner and the respondents which did not materialise. This is an obvious and apparent error on the face of the record. The agreements refer to the original owners from whom the vendors purchased the suit property as parties of the “first part”. The vendors are referred to as parties to the “second part”. The agreement dated 19 March 1994 is the agreement to sell that was executed by the original owners in favour of the vendors. The petitioner was not a party to this agreement. The 1997 agreements in favour of the petitioner were executed by the original owners in addition to the vendors because though the vendors were put in possession of the suit property after the sale agreement, a sale deed was not executed. Instead, an irrevocable power of attorney was executed in favour of the vendors. Though only the first and the second respondents offered to alienate the suit property to the petitioner, the agreement is executed by the original owners and vendors other than the first and the second respondent as well to prevent any litigation in the future. The relevant clauses of the recital to the agreement dated 26 March 1997 are extracted below: “4.
