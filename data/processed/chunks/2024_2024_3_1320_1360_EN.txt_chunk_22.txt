56. Needless to say, it is the duty of the Court to give effect to international agreements and treaties to which India is a party. In Entertainment Network (India) Ltd. v. Super Cassette Industries Ltd.,52 this Court observed that it has relied on international law extensively including for the purpose of fulfilling the spirit of international obligations which India has entered into, when they are not in conflict with the existing domestic law.53 It also rightly observed: “80. Furthermore, as regards the question where the protection of human rights, environment, ecology and other second-generation or third-generation rights is involved, the courts should not be loathe to refer to the international conventions.” 57. In Apparel Export Promotion Council v. A.K. Chopra,54 this Court cited numerous cases which constituted precedent for the proposition that this Court must give effect to international instruments which India is party to: “This Court has in numerous cases emphasised that while discussing constitutional requirements, court and counsel must never forget the core principle embodied in the international conventions and instruments and as far as possible, give effect to the principles contained in those international instruments. The courts are under an obligation to give due regard to international conventions 52 [2008] 9 SCR 165 : (2008) 13 SCC 30 53 This position has been reiterated by various other decisions of this Court. See, for instance, National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India, (2014) 5 SCC 438 54 [1999] 1 SCR 117 : (1999) 1 SCC 759 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1353 M K Ranjitsinh & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. and norms for construing domestic laws, more so, when there is no inconsistency between them and there is a void in domestic law. (See with advantage — Prem Shankar Shukla v. Delhi Admn. [(1980) 3 SCC 526 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 815 : AIR 1980 SC 1535] ; Mackinnon Mackenzie and Co. Ltd. v. Audrey D’ Costa [(1987) 2 SCC 469 : 1987 SCC (L&S) 100 : JT (1987) 2 SC 34] ; Sheela Barse v. Secy., Children’s Aid Society [(1987) 3 SCC 50, 54 : 1987 SCC (Cri) 458] SCC at p. 54; Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan [(1997) 6 SCC 241 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 932 : JT (1997) 7 SC 384] ; People’s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India [(1997) 3 SCC 433 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 434 : JT (1997) 2 SC 311] and D.K. Basu v. State of W.B. [(1997) 1 SCC 416, 438 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 92] SCC at p. 438. )” 58. India’s international obligations and commitments in the present case (detailed in the preceding segments of this ) have not been enacted in domestic law. Regardless, the Court must be alive to these obligations while adjudicating writ petitions which seek reliefs that may hinder these obligations from being fulfilled or otherwise interfere with India’s international commitments as well as the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change. 59. Beyond mere adherence to international agreements, India’s pursuit of sustainable development reflects the complex interplay between environmental conservation, social equity, economic prosperity and climate change.
