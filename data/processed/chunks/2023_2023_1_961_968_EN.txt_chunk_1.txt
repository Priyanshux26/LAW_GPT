[Para 6.1][967-C-E] 3. Applying the law laid down by this Court to the facts of the case on hand, it cannot be said that the punishment of dismissal can be said to be strikingly disproportionate warranting the D interference of the High Court in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In the facts and circumstances of the case and on the charges and misconduct of indiscipline and insubordination proved, the CRPF being a disciplined force, the of penalty of dismissal was justified and it cannot be said to be disproportionate and/or strikingly disproportionate to E the gravity of the wrong. Under the circumstances also, the Division Bench of the High Court has committed a very serious error in interfering with the of penalty of dismissal imposed and ing reinstatement of the respondent. [Para 6.3][968- B-D] 4. At this stage, it is required to be observed that even F while holding that the punishment/penalty of dismissal disproportionate to the gravity of the wrong, thereafter, no further punishment/penalty is imposed by the Division Bench of the High Court except denial of back wages. As per the settled position of law, even in a case where the punishment is found to be disproportionate to the misconduct committed and proved the G matter is to be remitted to the disciplinary authority for imposing appropriate punishment/penalty which as such is the prerogative of the disciplinary authority. On this ground also, the impugned and passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is unsustainable. [Para 6.4][968-E-F] Union of India vs. R.K. Sharma; (2001) 9 SCC 592 : H [2001] 3 Suppl.
