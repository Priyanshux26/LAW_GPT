Global (supra), which didlay down the law correctly. He began by pointing out that the Bench in N.N. Global (supra) was not correct in proceeding on the basis that, an Arbitration Agreement, was not required H M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 311 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] to be stamped. He drew our attention to Article 5 of Schedule I of the A Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 in this regard. It is his submission that the existence and/or validity of an Arbitration Agreement is not affected by the provisions of the Stamp Act. Non-payment of the stamp duty will not invalidate the instrument. It is a curable defect. A true reading of Section 11(6A) would establish that the impounding of an unstamped or deficiently B stamped instrument, is not to be done by the Judge under Section 11 but by the Arbitrator appointed under Section 11. Section 11(6A) compels the Court to confine its examination to the question of the existence of the Arbitration Agreement. In view of the fact that, neither Garware (supra) nor N.N. Global (supra) laid down the law correctly, he requested that the reference be reformulated as indicated later. C 13. Relying upon the of this Court in Hindustan Steel Ltd. v. Dilip Construction Company8, it is contended that an unstamped document can be acted upon, after payment of duty and penalty. Being a curable defect, it could not be found that an unstamped instrument did not exist in the eye of law. He drew our attention to the of the D Privy Council in Lachmi Narayan Agarwalla and Others v. Braja Mohan Singh (SINCE DECEASED)9, to contend that an unstamped instrument, with penalty paid, became effective in law. He further drew support from the following s: i. Joyman Bewa v. Easin Sarkar10; E ii. Gulzari Lal Marwari v. Ram Gopal11 iii. Purna Chandra Chakrabarty and others v. Kalipada Roy and another12. 14. The aforesaid case law, unerringly points to the conclusion F that failure to stamp a document, did not affect the validity of the document. It merely rendered the document inadmissible in evidence. From the of the Pakistan Supreme Court in United Insurance Company of Pakistan Limited v. Hafiz Muhammad Siddique13, the following words of Dorab Patel, J., are enlisted before us: G 8 (1969) 1 SCC 597 9 51 Indian Appeals 332 10AIR 1926 Calcutta 877 11ILR 1937 1 Calcutta 257 12 AIR 1942 Calcutta 386 13 PLD 1978 SC 279 H 312 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A “It would be against all cannons of construction to enlarge the meaning of the words in Section 35 so as to render invalid instruments which fall within mischief of the section.” 15. The learned Amicus would point out that stamp duty is levied with reference to the instrument and not the transaction. The Stamp Act B is a consolidating Act. It is a fiscal law. Securing revenue was the aim. It cannot be used to clothe a litigant with an arm of technicality.
