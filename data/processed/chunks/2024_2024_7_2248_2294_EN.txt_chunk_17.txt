Digital Supreme Court Reports 49. In Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6820 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2753 of 2023, the Section 4 notification was common. In those appeals, the land was situated in Survey No. 7/2 of Akoli Village Bujurg (Bk). The Reference Court by dated 15.01.2005 in LAC No. 183 of 2000 awarded Rs. 100 per sq. ft. which was the same rate awarded in LAC No. 209 of 2002 dated 10.08.2006, though in those matters lands were situated in Survey Nos. 6,7 and 60 at Akoli Khurd Village. 50. In matters involved in LAC No. 183 of 2000, the Land Acquisition Collector awarded Rs.5,61,000/- per hectare. It is important to note that even though the land was situated in Survey No. 7/2 of Akoli Bujurg, the Land Acquisition Collector awarded equal value for the lands in Survey No. 1 (the present appeals) as well as Survey No. 7/2 and the Reference Court also awarded Rs.100/- per sq. ft. for both the Survey Nos. 51. In LAC No. 209 of 2002, the Land Acquisition Officer awarded Rs.72,400/- per hectare for the land situated in Survey Nos, 6,7 and 60 of Akoli Khurd Village. The Reference Court and the High Court have awarded Rs.100/- per sq. ft. even for those set of lands, for plotted area of 359684.44 sq. ft. 52. The only reason why in the present the High Court did not award Rs.100/- per sq. ft. was the finding that the land was on the blue zone, which finding we have already set aside. The Land Acquisition Officer found similarity between the lands that are subject matter of LAC No. 183 of 2000 dated 15.01.2005 and the present land. If we are persuaded to hold that the of the Reference Court in LAC No.183 of 2000 with regard to the land in Survey No. 7/2 of Akola Bujurg Village is correct then there is no reason why the same value should not be awarded to the present appellant except to that extent of the land, if any, falling within the 15 meters restriction from the defined boundary of the water course as explained earlier. 53. If we peruse the award of the Reference Court dated 15.01.2005 in LAC No. 183 of 2000, as an exemplar, a sale deed marked in that case as (Exh. 45) executed by one Usha Santosh Gode in favour of Ashok Krushnarao Sapkal dated 12.02.1999 in respect of plot no. 78 was relied upon. This is the sale deed set out in the present case in the claim statement as well as in IA No. 85664 of 2019 which is an application for permission to file additional documents [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2271 Kazi Akiloddin v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. as Annexure-A3. Though what is given in the present case is an index of sale-purchase details as on 21.05.1999, the sale Exh.45 referred to in C.A. arising out if SLP (C) No. 6820 of 2023 and C.A.
