case for promotion at par with his juniors w.e.f. 03.02.1996, i.e., the date when they were promoted to the post of Assistant Registrar. 10. The learned Single Judge vide dated 27.08.2008 allowed the writ petition and relying on the Resolution dated 23.12.2000 observed that the services of the appellant did not get severed since he was retained to the original post and maintained the lien in terms of the Rule 20 Note-4 of KCS Rules. In other words, the learned Single Judge was of the opinion that there was continuation of service on the previous post as per said Rule, which states that if a government servant has secured employment in the same or other Department and is subsequently relieved from the previous post to join the new post, his lien on the previous/original appointment shall be continued to be maintained till he is ‘permanently absorbed’ in the Department or cadre in which he is newly appointed. However, regarding promotion, it was observed by the Single Bench that since the appellant has already superannuated from service, he may not derive the benefi ts of promotion at par with juniors but would be eligible for monetary benefi ts including pensionary and service benefi ts. 11. Challenging the said dated 27.08.2008, respondent-University fi led Writ Appeal No. 10003 of 2009 and contended that the appellant did not have a lien over the post of Offi ce Superintendent and ceased to have any association on the earlier post w.e.f. 04.02.1993 except to the extent of leave and pension. The writ appeal vide impugned was allowed setting aside the dated 27.08.2008 passed by learned Single Judge dismissing the Writ Petition No. 4066 of 2006. 12. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant submits that in furtherance to the Offi ce dated 08.04.1993, the past service of the appellant was protected for pensionary and monetary benefi ts, retaining his lien on the previous post and noted to record the said contents in his service book in terms of the Rule 252(b) of KCS Rules and Offi ce Memorandum dated 22.01.1972. It is further contended that Rule 20 Note 4 of the KCS Rules protects the lien of the appellant until he is permanently absorbed on the new post. On account of pending litigation, the appellant continued to be on probation throughout and he was never confi rmed substantively on the post of Assistant Registrar. Ultimately, his appointment was quashed by the High Court, whereafter, he was retained on his previous post of his L.R. PATIL v. GULBARGA UNIVERSITY, GULBARGA 111 [J. K. MAHESHWARI, J.] Offi ce Superintendent. However, it is urged that on his retention to the previous post, his past service cannot be washed away and his lien cannot be negated during the vulnerable period in which he was on probation in the new appointment. In support of the said contention, the contents of the Resolution dated 23.12.2000 re-appointing him as Offi ce Superintendent was relied upon. In support his submissions, counsel for the appellant placed reliance on the dated 25.02.2021 passed by Division Bench of High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in Writ Appeal No.
