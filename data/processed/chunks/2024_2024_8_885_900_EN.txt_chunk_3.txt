9. On the other hand, Justice Shiva Kirti Singh, held that the rejection in viva voce test is wrongful as it violated the statutory mandate which provided for selection based on the cumulative grade value obtained in the written exam and viva voce. It was noted that Grade ‘F’ for marks below 40% as provided in the evaluation table, corresponds 890 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports to securing ‘0’ marks and nothing beyond that. Grade ‘F’ is not an indicator of failure in the examination. ARGUMENTS 10. Before this Court, Mr. Rana Mukherjee, learned Senior Counsel for the writ petitioner would argue that when no minimum marks were prescribed in the viva-voce segment at the time when the recruitment commenced through the advertisement dated 15.05.2013, the Full Court could not have fixed minimum qualifying marks in the viva-voce since the unamended MJS Rules, 2005 never envisaged minimum marks in the viva-voce segment. According to the counsel, this is a case of midway change of rules of the game and therefore it is argued that the opinion expressed by Justice Shiva Kirti Singh should be accepted by this larger Bench. It was contended that the present case is covered by the decision of the five-judge Constitution Bench of this Court in Sivanandan C.T. & Ors vs High Court of Kerala & Ors2 (for short “Sivanandan CT”). 11.1 On the other hand, Mr. Vijay Hansaria, learned Senior Counsel would refer to the General Instructions contained in Schedule ‘B’ to the MJS Rules, 2005 to say that the petitioner was required to obtain 50% marks in the written examination to be eligible for the viva-voce segment which he did. The counsel however contends that those scoring below 40% in the interview, as per the mode of evaluation, should be considered in the ‘Fail’ category and here since the petitioner had secured less than 40% in the viva-voce segment, he was rightly held to be unsuccessful. 11.2 According to the counsel, the decision in Sivanandan C.T. (supra), can have no application in the present facts as in that case, the Rules were amended after the interview was over but in the present case, the requirement of minimum 40% in the interview segment was decided before the interview commenced. 11.3 Mr. Hansaria also drew our attention to the subsequent decisions of this Court in Kavita Kamboj v. High Court of P&H3 (for short “Kavita Khamboj”) and Abhimeet Sinha v High Court of Patna4(for short 2 [2017] 13 SCR 226 : (2023) SCC OnLine SC 994 3 [2024] 2 SCR 1136 : (2024) 7 SCC 103 4 [2024] 6 SCR 530 : (2024) 7 SCC 262 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 891 Salam Samarjeet Singh v. The High Court of Manipur at Imphal & Anr “Abhimeet Sinha”) to buttress his submission that the minimum marks for interview can be prescribed by the High Court and is not violative of the recommendations of the Shetty Commission and the decision of this Court in All India Judges Assn.
