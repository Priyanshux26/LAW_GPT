[Para 24-31] Interpretation of statutes – Interpretation of phrase ‘economic holding’ in the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 – Importing of the defi nition of ‘to hold land’ from the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966: Held: Preamble in the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 suggests that the object of the enactment was ‘to unify and amend the law relating to land and land revenue in the State of Maharashtra – The Act was brought in with the object of amending ‘the law relating to tenancies of agricultural lands and to make certain other provisions in regard to those lands’ – Under several provisions of the Act, reference is required to be made KESHAV BHAURAO YEOLE (D) BY LRS. v. MURALIDHAR 937 (D) & ORS. to the Code – Provisions contained in the Act and the Code operate in an overlapping sphere and fertilize each other – Words used in the Code and the expressions appearing under the Act, when read harmoniously, it would indicate that the expressions in both the enactments are complementary and supplementary to each other – Thus, the Act and Code are in pari materia to each other, and the defi nition of ‘to hold land’ is drifted from the Code for the purpose of interpreting the phrase, ‘economic holding’ in the Act – Thus, when s. 2(6A) of the Act and s. 2(12) of the Code are read together, the economic holding of a person would be computed by taking account of the lands possessed (whether actual or not) by such person, whether as owner or tenant.
