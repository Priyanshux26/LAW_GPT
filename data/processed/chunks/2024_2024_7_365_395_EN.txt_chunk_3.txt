One Jeeva had appeared and surrendered at the said police station in the late hours of the night on 10th June, 1992 as he had been arraigned as an accused in C.R. No. 555 of 1992 registered at the said police station for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 307, 323, 324 and 427 IPC.

Jeeva had come to surrender at the police station along with his advocate Shri Patanwadia and his two sisters namely, Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1) and Dhanlakshmi Vaiyapuri(PW-2). The advocate Shri Patanwadia left after production of Jeeva at the police station, however, the two sisters remained behind. 8. The original accused No.2(A2) was the Superintendent of Police at the relevant point of time who came to the police station sometime later. It is the case of prosecution that the two police officers i.e. A1 and A2, assaulted Jeeva with fists and sticks in the confines of the police station at separate intervals causing multiple injuries all over his body due to which he became unconscious. He was then dragged and placed in the lockup room of the police station. Next evening i.e. on 11th June, 1992, Jeeva was produced before the jurisdictional Magistrate, who remanded him to judicial custody whereafter, he was taken to and lodged at the Sabarmati Central jail. Jeeva’s condition deteriorated in the prison and thus, he was rushed to the civil hospital in the early hours of 12th June, 1992, where the doctors declared him dead. 9. Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1), the sister of Jeeva(deceased), forwarded a telegram(Exhibit-14) to the DGP office, Ahmedabad regarding the custodial torture leading to her brother Jeeva’s death. However, no action was forthcoming upon this telegraphic complaint, whereupon she lodged a complaint(Exhibit-13) in the Court of the Magistrate concerned on 1st July, 1992. In the interregnum, a magisterial enquiry(inquest) had been undertaken. The dead body of Jeeva(deceased) was subjected to postmortem at the BJ Medical College, Ahmedabad by Dr. Nayan Kumar-Medical Jurist(PW-9).
