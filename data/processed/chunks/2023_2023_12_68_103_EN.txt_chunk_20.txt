36. We are conscious that, by way of certain pronouncements, some of which are alluded to in this , the Court extended principles relating to elections to Parliament, State Assemblies and Municipalities to other arenas as well. Indicatively, the interpretation of s is always to be made with due regard to the facts and circumstances of the peculiar case concerned6. We have looked at Articles 243-O, 243ZG and 329 of the Constitution, and conclude that no bar hit the High Court, even on principle. Apart from the s expressly considered and dealt with, hereinbefore and hereinafter, we have perused, out of our own volition, the decisions, inter alia, of varying Bench-strength of this Court in N P Ponnuswami v Returning Offi cer, Namakkal Constituency, 1952 SCR 2187; Durga 5 See Paragraphs 27 and 28 in the report on this point. 6 Sanjay Dubey v State of Madhya Pradesh, 2023 INSC 519 @ Paragraph 18. 7 Where the Court held that “The discussion in this passage makes it clear that the word UNION TERRITORY OF LADAKH v. JAMMU AND KASHMIR 97 NATIONAL CONFERENCE [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] Shankar Mehta v Thakur Raghuraj Singh, (1955) 1 SCR 267; Hari Vishnu Kamath v Syed Ahmad Ishaque, (1955) 1 SCR 1104; Narayan Bhaskar Khare (Dr) v Election Commission of India, 1957 SCR 1081; Mohinder Singh Gill v Chief Election Commissioner, (1978) 1 SCC 405; Lakshmi Charan Sen v A K M Hassan Uzzaman, (1985) 4 SCC 689; Indrajit Barua v Election Commission of India, (1985) 4 SCC 722; Election Commission of India v Shivaji, (1988) 1 SCC 277; Digvijay Mote v Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 1758 ; Boddula Krishnaiah v State Election Commissioner, Andhra Pradesh, (1996) 3 SCC 416; Anugrah Narain Singh v State of Uttar Pradesh, (1996) 6 SCC 303; Election Commission of India v Ashok Kumar, (2000) 8 SCC 216; Kishansing Tomar v Municipal Corporation, Ahmedabad, (2006) 8 SCC 352; West Bengal State Election Commission v Communist Party of India (Marxist), (2018) 18 SCC 141; Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam v State of Tamil Nadu, (2020) 6 SCC 548; Laxmibai v Collector, (2020) 12 SCC 186, and last but not the least, State of Goa v Fouziya Imtiaz Shaikh, (2021) 8 SCC 4019. On scrutiny, in combination with the timelines and facts of the matter herein, we are sure that the High Court did not falter. 37. We would indicate that the restraint, self-imposed, by the Courts as a general principle, laid out in some detail in some of the decisions supra, in election matters to the extent that once a notifi cation is issued and the election process starts, the Constitutional Courts, under normal circumstances are loath to interfere, is not a contentious issue. But where issues crop up, indicating unjust executive action or an attempt to disturb a level-playing fi eld between candidates and/or political parties with no justifi able or intelligible basis, the Constitutional Courts are required, nay they are duty-bound, to step in. The reason that the Courts have usually “election” can be and has been appropriately used with reference to the entire process which consists of several stages and embraces many steps, some of which may have an important bearing on the result of the process.”, with respect to Article 329(b) of the Constitution.
