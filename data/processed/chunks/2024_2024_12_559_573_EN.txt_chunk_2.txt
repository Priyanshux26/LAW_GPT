Out of their wedlock, respondent No.2 and appellant No.1 have 2 minor children. The first child was born in the year 2016 and the second child was born in the year 2017. After marriage, appellant No.1 started harassing her both physically and mentally for want of additional dowry. Appellant No.1 also used to abuse respondent No.1 in filthy language and used to suspect her character. He also used to come home inebriated and harassed her by having an illegal affair with one Mounika. In so far as appellant Nos.2 to 6 are concerned, respondent No.2 alleged that they used to instigate appellant No.1 for demanding more dowry her. 4. Being aggrieved by the said criminal proceedings pending against them, the appellants and accused No.7 approached the High Court by filing Criminal Petition No.1479 of 2022 under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1908 (“CrPC”) seeking quashing of the FIR No.82 of 2022 dated 01.02.2022 registered with Neredmet Police Station, Rachakonda. 5. By the impugned dated 16.02.2024, the High Court refused to quash the criminal proceedings pending against the appellants and accused No.7 in FIR No.82 of 2022 dated 01.02.2022 and disposed of the Criminal Petition No.1479 of 2022 directing the Investigation Officer to follow the mandatory procedure contemplated under Section 41-A of CrPC and also the guidelines issued by this Court in Arnesh Kumar vs. State of Bihar (2014) 8 SCC 273. The High Court further granted protection by directing the Investigation Officer not to arrest to appellants until the chargesheet is filed. The High Court noted that there are matrimonial disputes between appellant No.1 and respondent No.2 and that in matrimonial disputes, custodial interrogation of the accused is not required. Being aggrieved by the High Court’s refusal to quash the criminal proceedings arising out [2024] 12 S.C.R. 563 Dara Lakshmi Narayana & Others v. State of Telangana & Another of FIR No.82 of 2022 dated 01.02.2022, the appellants herein have preferred the instant appeal. 6.

No.1544 of 2022 against the appellant Nos.1 to 6 under Section 498A of the IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Act. However, the charges were dropped against accused No.7 (respondent No.2’s brother- in-law). The criminal case against the appellants herein is pending trial in the Court of 1st Additional Junior Civil Judge-cum- Additional Metropolitan Magistrate, Malkajgiri. 7. We have heard learned counsel for the appellants and learned counsel for the respondent-State and perused FIR No.82 of 2022 dated 01.02.2022. There is no appearance on behalf of respondent No.2 despite service of notice. 8. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants never demanded any dowry from respondent No.2.
