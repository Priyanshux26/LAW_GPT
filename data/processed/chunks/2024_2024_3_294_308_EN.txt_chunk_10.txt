38. The appellants herein took a categoric stand in their depositions that they had returned the amounts borrowed from respondent Nos. 6, 7 and 8, but the books of accounts were not available because of lapse of time. The said plea of the appellants herein could not be treated as unnatural or an afterthought because once the transactions were completed and the loans were repaid, there was no reason for the appellants to have entertained a belief that after a period of about 13 years, they would be required to present the account books pertaining to transactions. It was neither a requirement in law nor could it be expected from the appellants herein to retain the books of accounts after more than a decade of the alleged suspicious transactions. 39. Resultantly, the conclusions drawn and the findings recorded in the impugned s passed by the Special Court that the appellants herein failed to prove the fact that the amounts had been repaid to the benami companies of the notified person, namely, Pallav Sheth do not stand to scrutiny and cannot be sustained as being contrary to facts and law. 40. As an upshot of the above discussion, the impugned s are hereby quashed and set aside. 41. The appeals are allowed accordingly. 42. The amounts deposited by the appellants in furtherance of the dated 14th March, 2014 shall be reimbursed to them forthwith. 43. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
