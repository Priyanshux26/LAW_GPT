Despite this, M/s SEG D raised the invoice/bill on the assessee treating it as ‘paper’. However, when the said bill of entry was presented treating the same as ‘paper’ for which the duty payable was ‘Nil’. Therefore, neither any custom duty was paid due to exemption from payment of duty treating it as ‘paper’ nor the service tax was paid. By a E detailed and , the Commissioner held that the respondent was liable to pay the service tax under taxable category ‘“design services”. However, by the impugned and , the CESTAT has held that the respondent is not liable to pay the service tax under “design services” under the Finance Act, 1994 mainly on the ground that the custom authority F considered the same as ‘goods’ and therefore the same activity cannot be taxed as ‘goods’ and ‘services’. The aforesaid view is absolutely erroneous. There can be two different taxes/levies under different heads by applying the aspect theory. The same activity can be taxed as ‘goods’ and ‘services’ provided the G contract is indivisible and on the aspect of services there may be levy of service tax. The aforesaid aspect has not at all been considered by the CESTAT while passing the impugned and . The definition of “design services” is very clear and it is wide enough to cover all “design services.” Merely because “Engineering Design & Drawings” prepared and supplied by H 326 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A sister company were shown as ‘goods’ under the Customs Act and in the bill of entry, by that itself cannot be a ground to take such services out of the definition of “design services” under the Finance Act, 1994. Even otherwise, there is a distinction between the sale of goods and a contract of service. What is relevant is the intention of the contracting parties and whether B the contracting parties intend transfer of both goods and services, either separately or in an indivisible manner or in a composite manner. The view taken by the CESTAT that the same activity cannot be taxed as goods and services is absolutely erroneous. The impugned and passed by the CESTAT setting C aside the levy of service tax is unsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside. [Paras 7-9][335-F-H; 336- A-G; 337-A] BSNL v.
