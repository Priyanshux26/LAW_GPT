[Paras 9 and 10] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Remission – Parameters to be considered – Discussed. [Para 11] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Remission – Role of presiding judge’s view – Weightage to be attached: Held: The discretion that the executive is empowered with in executing a sentence, would be denuded of its content, if the presiding judge’s view- which is formed in all likelihood, largely (if not solely) on the basis of the judicial record- is mechanically followed by the concerned authority – Such an approach has the potential to strike at the heart, and subvert the concept of remission- as a reward and incentive encouraging actions and behaviour geared towards reformation- in a modern legal system – If the presiding judge’s report is only refl ective of the facts and circumstances that led to the conclusion of the convict’s guilt, and is merely a reiteration of those circumstances available to the judge at the time of sentencing (some 14 or more years earlier, as the case may be), then the appropriate government should attach weight to this fi nding, accordingly – Such a report, cannot be 486 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. relied on as carrying predominance, if it focusses on the crime, with little or no attention to the criminal. [Paras 16 and 17] Sentencing – Heinous crimes: Held: Even at the stage of sentencing, the judge ideally is to exercise discretion after looking at a wide range of factors relating to the criminal and not just the crime; but as noticed in numerous precedents that have dealt with sentencing in the commission of heinous crimes, this is unfortunately, often not the reality – Guidance has been off ered by this court on how to mitigate this in recent years, but it is pragmatic to acknowledge that it will require time for our criminal justice system to incorporate, and uniformly reach such standards. Sentencing – Imprisonment – Aim and goal of – Discussed. [Para 19] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Remission – Report submitted by the SP in the second round was adverse – Duty of the appropriate government: Held: Report submitted by the Superintendent of Police in the second round (was diametrically diff erent from that which was submitted in the fi rst round), was adverse – In each case, the appropriate government has to be cognizant of the latent (not always) prejudices of the crime, that the police as well as the investigating agency, may be citing- especially in a case such as the present one, where the slain victims were police personnel themselves, i.e., members of the police force – These biases may inform the report, and cannot be given determinative value – Apart from the other considerations (on the nature of the crime, whether it aff ected the society at large, the chance of its recurrence, etc. ), the appropriate government should while considering the potential of the convict to commit crimes in the future, whether there remains any fruitful purpose of continued incarceration, and the socio-economic conditions, review: the convict’s age, state of heath, familial relationships and possibility of reintegration, extent of earned remission, and the post-conviction conduct including, but not limited to- whether the convict has attained any educational qualifi cation whilst in custody, volunteer services off ered, job/work done, jail conduct, whether they were engaged in any socially aimed or productive activity, and the overall development as a human being – The Board should not entirely rely either on the presiding judge, or the report prepared by the police – It RAJO @ RAJWA @ RAJENDRA MANDAL v.
