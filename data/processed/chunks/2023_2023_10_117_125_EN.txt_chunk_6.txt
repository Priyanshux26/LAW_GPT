16. Having allowed the workmen to put in regular service to its own benefit for over two decades, the management can no longer claim an indefeasible right to continue with and canvass its challenge to the Award, merely because it made its compliance with the Award conditional C long ago. In the light of their absorption in regular service, these workmen, who may have otherwise opted for employment opportunities elsewhere, altered their position and remained with the FCI. Having placed them in that position, it is no longer open to the management of FCI to seek to turn back the clock. Unfortunately, these crucial aspects were lost sight of by the Division Bench, while dealing with the management’s appeal. D In that view of the matter, we are not inclined to alter the position obtaining for over two decades, by accepting the legally weighty but essentially pedantic view taken by the Division Bench, ignoring the factual position. 17. The appeal filed by the Executive Staff Union of FCI, on E behalf of the workmen, is accordingly allowed and the dated 17.12.2020 in LPA No. 80 of 2019, passed by the Division Bench of the Jharkhand High Court, is set aside. In consequence, the dated 01.11.2018 passed by the learned Judge in CWJC No. 953 of 1998 (R) and the Award dated 18.03.1997 passed by the Central Government F Industrial Tribunal No.2, Dhanbad, in Reference No.128 of 1996, are restored, subject to the observations in the dated 26.07.2022 passed by this Court in Contempt Petition (C) No. 366 of 2021 in SLP (C) No. 3656 of 2021. The appeal filed by the management of FCI is dismissed. G Pending I.A.s, if any, in both appeals shall stand closed. Parties shall bear their own costs. Divya Pandey Appeals disposed of.
