[Para 22][1131-E-G; 1132-A-B] 2. Another reason that has weighed with this Court for interfering in the impugned s is that despite the appellant/ D prosecutrix having filed an application for intervention in the petition for anticipatory bail moved by the respondent No.2/ accused before the High Court, she was not afforded a hearing. At least a perusal of the second impugned does not reflect the said position. No doubt, the State was present and was E represented in the said proceedings, but the right of the prosecutrix could not have been whittled down for this reason alone. In a crime of this nature where ordinarily, there is no other witness except for the prosecutrix herself, it was all the more incumbent for the High Court to have lent its ear to the appellant. Such an approach tantamounts to failure to recognize the right of F the prosecutrix to participate in the criminal proceedings that would include a right to oppose the application for anticipatory bail moved by the accused. The appellant/prosecutrix having been denied a meaningful hearing when the first impugned of anticipatory bail granted in favour of the respondent No. 2/accused G was confirmed by the second impugned , is an additional factor that has prevailed with this Court to interfere in the impugned s.
