It must be noted that this requirement has been deleted by the Finance Act 2022;129 c. Section 148A(d) – to pass an deciding whether or not it is a fit case for issuing a notice under Section 148; and d. Section 148 – to issue a reassessment notice. 80. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court directed that Section 148 notices which were challenged before various High Courts “shall be deemed to have been issued under Section 148-A of the Income Tax Act as substituted by the Finance Act, 2021 and construed or treated to be show-cause notices in terms of Section 148-A(b).” Further, this Court dispensed with the requirement of conducting any enquiry with the prior approval of the specified authority under Section 148A(a). Under Section 148A(b), an assessing officer was required to obtain prior approval from the specified authority before issuing a show cause notice. When this Court deemed the Section 148 notices under the old regime as Section 148A(b) notices under the new regime, it impliedly waived the requirement of obtaining prior approval from the specified authorities under Section 151 for Section 148A(b). It is well established that this Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 142, is not bound by the procedural requirements of law.130 81. This Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra) directed the assessing officers to “pass s in terms of Section 148-A(d) in respect of each of the assesses concerned.” Further, it directed the assessing officers to issue a notice under Section 148 of the new regime “after following the procedure as required under Section 148-A.”Although this Court waived off the requirement of obtaining prior approval under Section 148A(a) and Section 148A(b), it did not waivethe requirement for Section 148A(d) and Section 148. Therefore, the assessing officer was required to obtain prior approval of the specified authority according to Section 151 of the new regime before passing an under Section 148A(d) or issuing a notice under Section 148. 129 Section 45, Finance Act 2022 130 Allahabad High Court Bar Association v.

Section 148 notices issued in June-September 2022 i. Scope of Article 142 82. Article 142 empowers this Court to pass such decree or make such as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.131 The discretionary jurisdiction exercised by this Court under Article 142 is of the widest amplitude.132 The Constitution has left it to the judicial discretion of this Court to decide the scope and limits of its jurisdiction to render substantial justice in matters coming before it.133 The expression “any cause or matter” mentioned under Article 142 includes every kind of proceeding pending before this Court.134 Article 142 allows this Court to give precedence to equity over law, provided the exercise of the discretion is consistent with constitutional provisions and after due consideration of substantive provisions instatutory law.135 83.
