OTHER CASE DETAILS INCLUDING IMPUGNED AND APPEARANCES CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Criminal Appeal No.2625 of 2023. From the and dated 18.04.2019 of the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur in MCRC No.1730 of 2019. Appearances: Varinder Kumar Sharma, Adv. for the Appellant. Sourbh Roy, Ld. AAG, Sumeer Sodhi, Prabudh Singh, Yash Gupta, Advs. for the Respondent. / OF THE SUPREME COURT C. T. RAVIKUMAR, J. 1. This appeal by special leave directed against the dated 18.04.2019 passed by the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur in MCRC No.1730/2019, owing to various circumstances including the inordinate delay occasioned in the matter of trial, now, poses a legal conundrum. The appellant is facing trial before the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raipur in criminal case arising from FIR No.22/2015 of Police Station, New Rajendra Nagar, Raipur in the State of Chhattisgarh, registered under Sections 420, 409/34 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred for short ‘IPC’) and Sections 3 and 4 of the Prize Chits and Money AMANDEEP SINGH SARAN v. STATE OF CHHATTISGARH 439 [C. T. RAVIKUMAR, J.] Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, 1978 (for short ‘the Banning Act’) and Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. In terms of Section 29(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short ‘Cr.PC’) the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raipur where the case is now pending can only impose, in case found him guilty, a maximum corporeal punishment of a term up to 7 years even if it is of the view that the appellant deserves more severe punishment. We may hasten to clarify here that we shall not be understood to have expressed an opinion that the appellant deserves to be convicted and handed down such a sentence. Even the question whether he should be convicted or acquitted is a matter of evidence and to be decided by the trial Court, on appreciation of evidence, at the appropriate stage of trial. But then, by now the appellant had already undergone incarceration for a term of more than eight years. We do not think it just or appropriate to treat this situation as a mere happenstance and leave it there for the appellant to get resolved or remedied later. Taking note of the scope of the SLP this Court, normally, would be loath to permit the parties to submit beyond the question whether to grant or not to grant bail, but the very peculiar circumstances involved and also evolved tends us to think that disinclination to go into the legal conundrum emerging in this case may result in great miscarriage of justice in all probabilities.
