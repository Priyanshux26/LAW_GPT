In the case based on circumstantial evidence, furnishing or D non-furnishing of the explanation by the accused would be a very crucial fact, when the theory of “last seen together” as propounded by the prosecution was proved against him. [Para 6][407-D-G] 1.2 It is discernible that though the last seen theory as propounded by the prosecution in a case based on circumstantial E evidence may be a weak kind of evidence by itself to base conviction solely on such theory, when the said theory is proved coupled with other circumstances such as the time when the deceased was last seen with the accused, and the recovery of the corpse being in very close proximity of time, the accused does F owe an explanation under Section 106 of the Evidence Act with regard to the circumstances under which death might have taken place. If the accused offers no explanation or furnishes a wrong explanation, absconds, motive is established and some other corroborative evidence in the form of recovery of weapon etc. forming a chain of circumstances is established, the conviction G could be based on such evidence. [Para 9][409-C-E] 2. So far as the facts in the instant case are concerned, it was duly proved that the death of the deceased was homicidal. It H 404 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A was not disputed that the petitioner had taken the deceased with him on the previous day evening and thereafter he was also seen with the deceased by the witness PW-4 and the very next day early morning, the dead body of the deceased was found lying in the field at village Chachiha. The time gap between the period when the deceased was last seen with the accused and the B recovery of the corpse of the deceased being quite proximate, the non-explanation of the petitioner with regard to the circumstance under which and when the petitioner had departed the company of the deceased was a very crucial circumstance proved against him. Having regard to the oral evidence of the C witnesses, the enmity between the deceased and the petitioner had also surfaced. The corroborative evidence with regard to recovery of the weapon – axe alleged to have been used in the commission of crime from the petitioner, also substantiated the case of prosecution.
