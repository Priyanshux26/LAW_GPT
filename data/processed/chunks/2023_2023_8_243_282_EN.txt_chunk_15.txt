Patel Group and the Sheth Group. The NCLAT appears to, however, support the direction on the basis we have noted above. C 25. Shri Nitin Rai emphasised that the Board of Directors could not have allotted the shares, when the existing authorised capital was already subscribed and, what is more, paid-up. Putting the cart before the horse, as it were, applications were invited from shareholders to apply for shares which were not existing. In other words, it was only after the increase in the authorised capital by the decision of the D Extraordinary General Body Meeting held of the shareholders of 27.01.2010, from Rs.1 crore to Rs.2 crores, that the Board could have resolved to invite applications. In this regard, he drew support from of this Court in NanalalZaver and another v. Bombay Life Assurance Company Limited and others3. E 26. In the decision reported in Needle Industries (India) Ltd. and others v. Needle Industries Newey (India) Holding Ltd. and others4, we notice the following statements: “110. Before we leave this topic, we would like to mention that the mere circumstance that the Directors derive benefit as F shareholders by reason of the exercise of their fiduciary power to issue shares, will not vitiate the exercise of that power. As observed by Gower in Principles of Modern Company Law, 4th Edn., p. 578: “As it was happily put in an Australian case they are “not required G by the law to live in an unreal region of detached altruism and to act in a vague mood of ideal abstraction from obvious facts which must be present to the mind of any honest and intelligent man when he exercises his power as a director.” 3 AIR 1950 SC 172/1950 SCC 137 H 4 (1981) 3 SCC 333 HASMUKHLAL MADHAVLAL PATEL v. AMBIKA FOOD 265 PRODUCTS PVT. LTD. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] The Australian case referred to above by the learned Author A is Mills v. Mills [60 CLR 150, 160] which was specifically approved by Lord Wilberforce in Howard Smith [1974 AC 821, 831] . In NanalalZaver [1950 SCC 137 : AIR 1950 SC 172 : 1950 SCR 391, 394] too, Das, J. stated at p. 425 that the true principle was laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy B Council in Hirsche v. Sims [1894 AC 654, 660-61 : 64 LJ PC 1 : 71 LT 357 : 10 TLR 616] thus: “If the true effect of the whole evidence is, that the defendants truly and reasonably believed at the time that what they did was for the interest of the company, they are not chargeable with dolus C malus or breach of trust merely because in promoting the interest of the company they were also promoting their own, or because they afterwards sold shares at prices which gave them large profits.” 111. Whether one looks at the matter from the point of view D expressed by this Court in NanalalZaver [1950 SCC 137 : AIR 1950 SC 172 : 1950 SCR 391, 394] or from the point of view expressed by the Privy Council in Howard Smith [1974 AC 821, 831] the test is the same, namely, whether the issue of shares is simply or solely for the benefit of the Directors.
