bodies before undertaking such activities. Failure to do so may result in cancellation H BHASIN INFOTECH AND INFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATE LTD. 1081 v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] of allotment of the whole plot or part thereof as UPSIDC A deems fit. Therefore, to say that the condition of tripartite sublease deed does not apply to them is not legal. Apart from this, the lease deed executed on 30.03.2009 mentions the execution of tripartite sub- lease deed. Since in the lease deed executed on 23.08.2006 the B area is 37208.00 and the area mentioned in the lease deed executed on 30.03.2009 is 3297.00 square meters, the integrated map of the total area of 40505.00 square meters has been approved on 08.10.2009. Therefore, in the above circumstances also the execution of tripartite sub-lease deed is justified under the rules C of the Authority. Should the tripartite sub-lease deed be executed at present or not? Regarding the above, Writ Petition No. 1821/2021 is pending before the Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad, due to which the Authority has received a stay on 11.10.2021 in the ongoing D case No. 257/2018 issued by the Hon’ble ACJ (SD) Gautam Budh Nagar. Since the matter in question is sub-judice in the Hon’ble High Court, it is not appropriate to take any final decision on it. As per above it is clear that the leasehold plot number- SH-3, Industrial area Surajpur site-4 in question was requested by Shri E SS Bhasin to be freehold in accordance with the mandate issued by the tourism department for the year 2013 and 2016 under the terms of allotment letter and lease deed and due to non-compliance and in the light of the opinion made available by the Justice Department in the past, due to the lack of legality and the provisions mentioned in the Government dated 06.11.2013 and F 03.05.2016 issued by the Department of Tourism. There is no free-hold policy in respect of the Industrial Development Authority’s land. In view of the provisions of the mandate dated 06.11.2013 and 03.05.2016, the plot No. SH-3, Industrial Area, Surajpur Site-4, District- Gautam Budh Nagar in question of the G petitioner is not legal to be freehold. Therefore, in the above case, regarding the fee-holding of plot no. SH-03, Industrial Area Surajpur site-4, the request and representation of Shri SS Bhasin, director of the allottee company M/s Bhasin Infotech and Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, was submitted H 1082 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A to the Hon’ble Supreme Court on 21.01.2022. In compliance with the dated 13.12.2021, it is hereby disposed of as above.” (emphasis in bold as in original) 7.
