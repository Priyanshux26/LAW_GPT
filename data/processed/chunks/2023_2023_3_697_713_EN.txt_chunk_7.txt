Antulay v. R.S. Nayak [(1992) 1 SCC 225] , release on bail, which can be taken to be embedded in the right of G speedy trial, may, in some cases be the demand of Article 21. As we have not felt inclined to accept the extreme submission of quashing the proceedings and setting free the accused whose trials have been delayed beyond reasonable time for reasons already alluded to, we have felt that deprivation of H 10 [1994] Supp. 4 SCR 386: (1994) 6 SCC 731 MOHD MUSLIM @ HUSSAIN v. STATE (NCT OF DELHI) 707 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] the personal liberty without ensuring speedy trial would also A not be in consonance with the right guaranteed by Article 21. Of course, some amount of deprivation of personal liberty cannot be avoided in such cases; but if the period of deprivation pending trial becomes unduly long, the fairness assured by Article 21 would receive a jolt. It is because of B this that we have felt that after the accused persons have suffered imprisonment which is half of the maximum punishment provided for the offence, any further deprivation of personal liberty would be violative of the fundamental right visualised by Article 21, which has to be telescoped with the right guaranteed by Article 14 which also promises justness, C fairness and reasonableness in procedural matters.” 13. When provisions of law curtail the right of an accused to secure bail, and correspondingly fetter judicial discretion (like Section 37 of the NDPS Act, in the present case), this court has upheld them for conflating two competing values, i.e., the right of the accused to enjoy D freedom, based on the presumption of innocence, and societal interest – as observed in Vaman Narain Ghiya v. State of Rajasthan11 (“the concept of bail emerges from the conflict between the police power to restrict liberty of a man who is alleged to have committed a crime, and presumption of innocence in favour of the alleged criminal….”). E They are, at the same time, upheld on the condition that the trial is concluded expeditiously. The Constitution Bench in Kartar Singhv.State of Punjab12 made observations to this effect. In Shaheen Welfare Association v. Union of India13 again, this court expressed the same sentiment, namely that when stringent provisions are enacted, curtailing the provisions of bail, and restricting judicial discretion, it is on the basis F that investigation and trials would be concluded swiftly. The court said that Parliamentary intervention is based on: “a conscious decision has been taken by the legislature to sacrifice to some extent, the personal liberty of an undertrial accused for the sake of protecting the community and the G nation against terrorist and disruptive activities or other activities harmful to society, it is all the more necessary that 11 [2008] 17 SCR 369: (2009) 2 SCC 281 12 [1994] 2 SCR 375: (1994) 3 SCC 569 13 [1996] 2 SCR 1123: (1996) 2 SCC 616 H 708 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R.
