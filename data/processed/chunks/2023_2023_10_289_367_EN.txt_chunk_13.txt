A or paternal grandfather or brother from the same father has been recorded in that register;” 4.18 It appears that in view of Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, effectively 94% of the residents of Sikkim are exempted from payment of Income Tax under the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, B 5% of the residents of Sikkim of which about 1% are the people like the petitioners, who, as such are also the bona fide settlers of Sikkim, are being singled out from exemption from payment of income tax on the sole ground that they are not recorded in the register under the Sikkim Subjects Regulation 1961. It appears that approximately 500 such families are affected by the definition of the “Sikkimese”. C 4.19 It appears that various representations were made against such a discriminatory treatment by the Petitioners to the Government of Sikkim as well as the Union Finance Minister time and again. In the year 2009, the Government of Sikkim appointed a Committee to look into the grievances of the petitioners’ Association. The Committee made certain D recommendations, which shall be dealt with hereinbelow. 4.20 As observed hereinabove, as per Proviso to Section 10(26AAA) “a Sikkimese women who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” is excluded for getting the benefit of exemption under Section 10(26AAA).

Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the definition of “Sikkimese” in Section 10(26AAA) to the extent it excludes Indians (having Indian citizenship), who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975 and thereby not granting the benefit of exemption under Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act to such F Indians and being aggrieved by the Proviso to Section 10(26AAA), insofar as, it excludes from the exempted category “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008”, the present writ petitioners have prayed to strike down Section 10(26AAA) to the extent it excludes Indians, who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975 and insofar as it excludes from the G exempted category “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.4.2008, being arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 6.
