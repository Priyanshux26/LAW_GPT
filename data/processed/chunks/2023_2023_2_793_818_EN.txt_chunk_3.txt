797 a separate authority, is bound to wait for the decision of the A Advisory Board. both, the detaining authority, and the Government, have worked precisely within the procedure established by law, and hence the impugned detention is not liable to be struck down on this ground. [Paras 36-38][815- D-H] B 4. Whether the illegible documents written in Chinese submitted to the appellant herein are grounds enough for quashing the impugned detention ? In cases where illegible documents have been supplied to the detenue, a grave prejudice is caused to the detenue in availing C his right to send a representation to the relevant authorities, because the detenue, while submitting his representation, does not have clarity on the grounds of his or her detention. In such a circumstance, the relief under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India and the relevant statutory provisions allowing for D submitting a representation are vitiated, since no man can defend himself against an unknown threat. In cases of preventive detention, every procedural irregularity, keeping in mind the principles of Article 21 and Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India, must be accrued in favour of the detenue. In the present case at hand, the appellant detenue herein has been supplied E with illegible documents in a foreign language. These are the very same documents that the authorities have relied upon to detain the appellant herein. Further, the principle of parity is squarely applicable in this case, since another co-detenue with identical circumstances, has already been granted the relief of F quashing the detention against him. While the appellant has already been released on grounds of expiry of the detention period, for the sake of clarity on the point of law, it is held that the impugned detention is liable to be set aside.
