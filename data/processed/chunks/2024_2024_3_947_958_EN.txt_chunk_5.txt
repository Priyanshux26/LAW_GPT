To establish whether the “consent” was vitiated by a “misconception of fact” arising out of a promise to marry, two propositions must be established. The promise of marriage must have been a false promise, given in bad faith and with no intention of being adhered to at the time it was given. The false promise itself must be of immediate relevance, or bear a direct nexus to the woman›s decision to engage in the sexual act. 19. The allegations in the FIR indicate that in November 2009 the complainant initially refused to engage in sexual relations with the accused, but on the promise of marriage, he established sexual relations. However, the FIR includes a reference to several other allegations that are relevant for the present purpose. They are as follows: 19.1. The complainant and the appellant knew each other since 1998 and were intimate since 2004. 19.2. The complainant and the appellant met regularly, travelled great distances to meet each other, resided in each other›s houses on multiple occasions, engaged in sexual intercourse regularly over a course of five years and on multiple occasions visited the hospital jointly to check whether the complainant was pregnant. 19.3. The appellant expressed his reservations about marrying the complainant on 31-1-2014. This led to 3 [2019] 11 SCR 423 : (2019) 9 SCC 608 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 955 Ms. X v. Mr. A and Others arguments between them. Despite this, the appellant and the complainant continued to engage in sexual intercourse until March 2015.” 12. This Court, in the facts of the said case, set aside the of the High Court which refused to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash the proceedings. The Court found that this was a fit case wherein the High Court ought to have invoked its jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash the proceedings. 13. In the present case also, the facts are almost similar. Even as per the version of the complainant, the following facts have been emerged: (i) 4 years prior to the FIR being lodged on 1st October 2020, accused No. 1 followed the prosecutrix and told her that he loved her and she should also love him; (ii) After a period of 2 years, she agreed to love him and both were intimate with each other; (iii) One year prior to the date of the incident, accused No. 1 took the prosecutrix to his aunty’s house in Chitradurga and they stayed there. On that day at about 09.00 am, in his aunty’s house, by giving trust and belief that he would marry her, accused No. 1 forcibly made sexual contact with the prosecutrix; (iv) Thereafter, accused No. 1 took the prosecutrix to various places including his own house and committed sexual intercourse with her; and (v) As per the version of the prosecutrix, the first incident has taken place in the year 2019. As per Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board Certificate, her date of birth is 12th September 1998. Even if it is assumed that the incident has taken place in January 2019, she would have been over the age of 18.
