[Paras 131(III), 130] Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 – ss.3(1), 2(21), 10 – Harmonious construction – Various provisions were cited to contend that the legislature had placed LMVs and Transport Vehicles under separate classes and that the holder of a LMV license cannot drive a Transport Vehicle without a separate endorsement – Whether the second part of s.3(1) which emphasizes the 544 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports necessity of specific requirement of a driving license for a ‘Transport Vehicle’ overrides the definition of LMV in s.2(21) : Held: No – Section 3 is not a special provision overriding the strict and emphatic definition of LMV, given in Section 2(21) and the separate class of ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ provided in Section 10 – Section 2(21) uses the term ‘means’ and there is an affirmation of certainty in the wordings of the definition and it is to be recognized sensu stricto in a technical sense and must not be understood loosely – Section 3 does not disentitle the LMV license holders to drive transport vehicles of the permissible weight category – To say otherwise would be incompatible and would render the strict definition clause, sterile and a ‘dead letter’ – In view of a harmonious construction of both sections, for LMV licence holders, a separate endorsement under ‘Transport Vehicle’ class would be unnecessary for driving LMV class of vehicles – Additional licensing requirements will have no application for the LMV class of vehicles but will be needed only for such ‘Transport Vehicles’, which by virtue of their gross weight fall in the Medium and Heavy category – This construction also fulfills the legislative purpose to ensure road safety – Age restrictions outlined in Section 4, the requirement of a medical certificate, and the criteria under Section 7 should reasonably apply only for the medium and heavy transport vehicles whose gross weight will be above 7500 Kg – A person holding a LMV license is equally competent to drive a Transport Vehicle whose gross weight does not exceed 7,500 kgs – The reference to ‘transport vehicle’ in Section 3(1) and other sections of the Act and Rules apply to only those vehicles which fall beyond the scope of the sensu stricto definition under Section 2(21) – This interpretation would ensure that no provision or word is rendered otiose and the licensing regime remains coherent with the legislative intent.
