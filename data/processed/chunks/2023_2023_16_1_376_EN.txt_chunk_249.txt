However, this need not have been done, since the President had the power to exercise the power under Article 370(3) unilaterally. 3. The issuance of CO 272. A. The power under Article 370(1)(d) read with Article 367 was improperly exercised. 111 The Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956. 112 Black’s Law Dictionary, (VI Edition, 1990). IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 357 [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] 79. On 5 August 2019, the President issued C.O. 272 under Article 370(1)(d) applying the entire Constitution of India to the State, but modifi ed Article 367 by adding Article 367(4). Article 367(4), after C.O. 272, reads as follows: “(4) For the purposes of this Constitution as it applies in relation to the State of Jammu and Kashmir – (a) references to this Constitution or to the provisions thereof shall be construed as references to the Constitution or the provisions thereof as applied in relation to the said State; (b) reference to the person for the time being recognized by the President on the recommendation of the Legislative Assembly of the State as the Sadar-i-Riyasat of Jammu and Kashmir, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers of the State for the time being in offi ce, shall be construed as references to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir; (c) references to the Government of the said State shall be construed as including references to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir acting on the advice of his Council of Ministers; and (d) in proviso to clause (3) of article 370 of this Constitution, the expression “Constituent Assembly of the State referred to in clause (2)” shall read “Legislative Assembly of the State”” 80. In eff ect, C.O. 272 envisaged that the recommendation under Article 370(3) could be provided by the Legislative Assembly of the State. C.O. 272 has been impugned on the basis that Article 370(1)(d) cannot be used to amend Article 370 and that the power under Article 370(1)(d) can only be exercised with concurrence of the Government of the State. 81. The Petitioners contend that the addition of Article 367(4)(d) r/w Article 370(1)(d) amounts to an amendment of Article 370(3), which exceeds the power of the President to make modifi cations under Article 370(1)(d), and is not in accordance with the procedure under the Constitution. 82. Mr. Mehta submits that there was no necessity for the Union to modify Article 370(3) using Article 367(4)(d). However, as Mr. Sibal rightly submits, the Union’s actions must be tested for what they are. 358 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. Article 370(1)(d) does not allow modifi cations to Article 370 83. The power under Article 370(1)(d) can only be exercised to make modifi cations to terms of the Constitution other than Article 370 and Article 1. This can be gathered from a combined reading of Article 370(1)(c) and (d). Article 370(1)(c) lays down that Article 1 and Article 370 shall apply to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370(1)(d) permits the President to apply other provisions of the Constitution, even with modifi cations.
