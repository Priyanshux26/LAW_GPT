A look at the impugned of the High Court shows that the Division Bench of the High Court was swayed away unduly by the animosity attributed by the E respondent to a member of the local Bar and the Assistant Public Prosecutor. If it is assumed for a minute that the charges were on the basis of complaints initiated by persons bearing ill-will and motive against the respondent. Even then, such ill-will and motive may not make the conduct of the respondent in not preparing s but pronouncing the outcome of the case, a F condonable conduct. It is true that some of the charges revolve around judicial pronouncements and the judicial decision-making processes and that they cannot per se, without anything more, form the foundation for departmental proceedings. Therefore, this Court is ignoring those charges. But the charges which G revolve around gross negligence and callousness on the part of the respondent in not preparing/dictating s, but providing a fait accompli, is completely unacceptable and unbecoming of a judicial officer. [Paras 13, 14, 15][59-F-H; 60-A- B] H THE REGISTRAR GENERAL, HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA v. 53 SRI M. NARASIMHA PRASAD 3. The defence taken by the respondent that the lack of A experience and the inefficiency on the part of the stenographer has to be blamed, for the whole text of the not getting ready even after several days of pronouncement of the result in open court, was entirely unacceptable. But unfortunately, the High Court not only accepted this panchatantra story, but also went to B the extent of blaming the administration for not examining the stenographer as a witness. Such an approach is wholly unsustainable. If it was the case of the respondent that the entire blame lay upon the stenographer, it was for him to have summoned the stenographer as a witness. The High Court unfortunately reversed the burden of proof.
