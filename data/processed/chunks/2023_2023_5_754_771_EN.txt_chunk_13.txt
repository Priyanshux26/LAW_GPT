salutary provision of Section 342 of CrPC of 1898. We are sorry to note A that the situation continues to be the same after 72 years as we see such defaults in large number of cases. The National and the State Judicial Academies must take a note of this situation. The Registry shall forward a copy of this decision to the National and all the State Judicial Academies. 23. In the circumstances, we are of the view that the conviction B of the appellant stands vitiated. In the facts of the case, the option of remand will be unjust. Accordingly, we allow the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant under the and dated 27th August 2003 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi, in Sessions Case No.9 of 2000. Consequently, the impugned C of the High Court is also set aside. We make it clear that both s are set aside only insofar as the appellant is concerned. We, accordingly, direct that the respondent shall forthwith set the appellant at liberty unless he is required to be detained in connection with any other case. D Divya Pandey Appeal allowed.
