Deshpande (Handwriting Expert) Exhibit D-8 Copies of specimen signature of Smt. Sushila Bai to D-20 16. We have mentioned this list only for the purpose of showing as to what were the documents generally filed by the parties. Most of the documents were common for all the six suits. The difference in different suits could be of numbering of the documents as exhibits but, more or less, they are one and the same. 17. We may now briefly refer to the discussion and analysis made by the Trial Court including the documents relied upon by it while decreeing the suit. The Trial Court thoroughly analysed the claims of both the parties, particularly focusing on the Agreement to Sell dated 2390 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 30.08.1990 and the subsequent conduct of the parties. Following findings were recorded by the Trial Court: 17.1. The Trial Court found that the appellants had paid the entire sale consideration at the time of the agreement, and the possession of the disputed land was handed over by Sushila Devi to the plaintiff-appellants. The appellants remained in possession of the land since 30.08.1990, using it for agricultural purposes. The Trial Court also noted that after Sushila Devi’s death on 17.12.1992, the appellants had repeatedly requested the defendants, as legal heirs, to execute the sale deed in their favour, which the defendants failed to do. This refusal constituted the cause of action for filing the suit for specific performance. 17.2. The Trial Court relied on the Power of Attorney holder, Pankaj Maheshwari, as a key witness. He testified to his personal knowledge of the facts, the execution of the agreement, and the possession handed over to the plaintiff. Notably, Pankaj Maheshwari also presented crucial documents, including the original loan book, the registered sale deed of 1966, and the Power of Attorney, all of which were duly exhibited before the Trial Court. The agreement was witnessed by Dipesh Chandra Patni and one Mr. Sharma. Dipesh Chandra Patni was examined as plaintiff’s witness supporting the appellants’ case. 17.3. The defendants, despite alleging fraud and forgery regarding the execution of the agreement and Power of Attorney, failed to appear or provide any rebuttal evidence. The Trial Court emphasized that the burden of proving fraud lay with the defendants, who did not present any credible evidence to support their claims. The Trial Court held that the defendants’ absence and failure to present any substantial challenge to the appellants’ evidence effectively confirmed the validity of the agreement. 17.4. Further, the Trial Court addressed the sale of the disputed property by the defendants to subsequent purchasers, Defendant Nos. 7 to 10, during the pendency of the trial. It noted that a prohibition had been passed restraining such a transfer, yet the defendants proceeded with the sale in violation of the Court’s directive.
