Moreover, a suit filed by the land-owners/principals at Dehradun prior to the lodging of the FIR, for the same cause of action, has been dismissed in favour of the appellant, where a specific plea to cancel the Sale Deed stands rejected. 34. In sum, the dispute, if any, is between the land-owners/principals inter-se and/or between them and the PoA-holder. We think it would be improper to drag the appellant into criminal litigation, when he had no role either in the execution of the PoA nor any misdeed by the PoA-holder vis-à-vis the land-owners/principals. Moreover, the entire consideration amount has been paid by the appellant to the PoA-holder. 35. On an overall circumspection of the entire facts and circumstances, we find that the Impugned needs to be and is hereby set aside. This Court has held that in the appropriate case, protection is to be accorded against unwanted criminal prosecution and from the prospect of unnecessary trial5. We quash FIR No.87 of 2011 dated 19.03.2011, Dumraon Police Station, Buxar, Bihar as also the taking cognizance dated 18.11.2014 and all consequential acts emanating therefrom, insofar as they relate to the appellant. 5 Priyanka Mishra v State of Madhya Pradesh, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 978 and Vishnu Kumar Shukla v State of Uttar Pradesh, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1582. 1178 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
