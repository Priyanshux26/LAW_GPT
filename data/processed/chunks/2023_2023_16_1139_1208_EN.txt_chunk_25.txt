The High Court had interpreted the term “is” occurring in the DTAAs [see Clause IV(2)36 of the India-Netherlands DTAA – the other two clauses in relation to France and Switzerland being similar], which according to it “describes a state of aff airs that should exist not necessarily at the time when the subject DTAA was executed but when a request is made by the taxpayer or deductee for issuance of a lower rate withholding tax certifi cate under Section 197 of the Act. The word ‘is’- is both autological and heterological. An autological word is one that expresses the property that it possesses. Opposite of that is a heterological word, i.e., it does not describe itself”. According to that interpretation of ‘is, when the request for parity is made by a party seeking aid of the DTAA and the Protocol containing a “same treatment” or in other words, a pull in clause, the court has to consider whether at that time the third party state is enjoying better benefi ts. Integral to this interpretation is whether the “is a member” means the present tense, which is that the third party state should be a member of OECD when it enters into DTAA with India. This is relevant, because the India-Lithuania 36 “If after the signature of this convention under any Convention or Agreement between India and a third State which is a member of the OECD, India should limit its taxation at source on dividends, interests, royalties, fees for technical services or payments for the use of equipment to a rate lower or a scope more restricted than the rate or scope provided for in this Convention on the said items of income, then as from the date on which the relevant Indian Convention or Agreement enters into force the same rate or scope as provided for in that Convention or Agreement on the said items of income shall also apply under this Convention.” [emphasis supplied] ASSESSING OFFICER CIRCLE (INTERNATIONAL TAXATION) 2(2)(2) 1175 NEW DELHI v. M/S NESTLE SA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] DTAA was signed on 26.07.2011; and notifi ed on 25.07.201237. The date of membership of Lithuania into OECD was 05.07.2018. The India-Colombia DTAA was signed on 13.05.2011; its date of Notifi cation was 23.09.2014. Colombia was admitted to membership of OECD on 28.04.2020. Slovenia signed a DTAA with India on 13.01.2003; this was notifi ed on 31.05.2005, and Slovenia became a member of OECD on 21.07.2010. An amending Protocol was entered into, between India and Slovenia, on 16.05.2016, which was notifi ed on 27.10.2017. 49. Thus, in all three cases, the three “third party” nations: Lithuania, Colombia and Slovenia, were initially not members of OECD when they entered into treaties and protocols with India; they became members later. 50. In Jagir Kaur v. Jaswant Singh38 Section 488 of the erstwhile Criminal Procedure Code read as follows: “Proceedings under this Section may be taken against any person in any district where he resides or is, or where he last resided with his wife, or, as the case may be, the mother of the illegitimate child.” This court considered the meaning of “is” in the above provision: “The crucial words of the sub-Section are, “resides”, “is” and “where he last resided with his wife”.
