Alternatively, E assuming communal purpose, would not include construction of roads on OSR land, in the facts of the case, appeal is made that this Court may not interfere in the Extraordinary Jurisdiction under Article 136. SUBMISSIONS MADE BY SRI JAYANTH MUTHRAJ, SENIOR ADVOCATE RESPONDENTS NOS. 1 AND 2 IN C.A. NO. 1890 OF 2010. F 25. The developers had transferred, in the interest of public, 1100 square meters of land, to the Authority for roads, parks and other open spaces by the gift deed dated 18.02.1994. In the year 2003, the Corporation of Chennai laid metal road, which provided a direct and short link to the Velacherry 100 feet bypass road to enable thousands of general public G to have easy access and movements. The appellant-association has no locus as it is neither the owner of the property nor has any usage right been assigned to it. The CMDA is the absolute owner of the gifted property. The public road was laid as per the terms of the gift. The 25 (1986) 2 SCC 516 H 1054 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A property is used for communal purpose. The word ‘communal’ means public. He relies on the definition of the word ‘communal’ in the International Websters Comprehensive Dictionary of the English Language Encyclopaedic Edition (2004 Edition) to mean ‘common; public; belonging to a community’. He also would contend that the DCR was prepared in accordance with Section 17 read with Section 9C, Section B 20(1)(d) and Section 20(1)(k) and Section 35 with Section 124. Rules and Regulations are authorised. He relies on the Judgement of this Court in R.K. Mittal and others v. State of Uttar Pradesh and others26 and New Delhi Municipal Council and others v. Tanvi Trading and Credit Private Limited and others27. The impugned Rule is not an expropriatory C action. It is only regulatory. The Rule is informed by intelligible differentia having a nexus with the object. The challenge is academic as the DCR is already repealed by the Regulation made on 02.09.2008. There is latches in filing the Writ Petition after 13 years of the execution of the gift deed. Even assuming the Rule is bad, the gift deed is beyond challenge. The appellants having maintained Writ Petition (Civil) No. 4766 of 2007, D based on the gift deed, cannot challenge the validity of the gift deed in the subsequent Writ Petition. Estoppel and constructive res judicata are principles which are enlisted in support. SUBMISSIONS BY SHRI K.S. SURESH, ADVOCATE IN CIVIL APPEAL NO.7848 OF 2013 E 26. Shri K.S.
