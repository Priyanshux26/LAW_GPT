On the perusal of said report and other materials, the impugned decision came to be passed. 25 (a) 19. As submitted on behalf of Union of India, a Constitution Bench of this Court in State of U.P. v. Batuk Deo Pati Tripathi (5-Judge Bench)15 expounded that: “10… The power to do a thing necessarily carries with it the power to regulate the manner in which the thing may be done. It is an incident of the power itself and indeed, without it, the exercise of the power may in practice be fraught with difficulties which will frustrate, rather than further, the object of the power. It is undoubtedly true that the rules framed for prescribing the manner in which a power may be exercised have to be truly regulatory in character.” (Emphasis supplied) 25 (a) 20. This decision was followed in Khargram Panchayat Samiti v. State of West Bengal (2-Judge Bench),16 wherein it was observed: 15 [1978] 3 SCR 131 : (1978) 2 SCC 102 16 [1987] 2 SCR 1207 : (1987) 3 SCC 82 1886 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “5…. It had earlier been laid down by a Constitution Bench in the case of State of U.P. v. Batuk Deo Pati Tripathi [(1978) 2 SCC 102 : 1978 SCC (L & S) 147] that a power to do a thing necessarily carries with it the power to regulate the manner in which the thing may be done. The High Court failed to appreciate that the power to grant a licence for the holding of a hat or fair under Section 117 of the Act necessarily carries with it the power to specify a day on which such hat or fair shall be held. Such power to specify a day must be held to be a power incidental to or consequential upon the principal power of issuing a licence under Section 117 of the Act for holding of a hat or fair. The Rules or the absence of it do not detract from the substantive power conferred by a statute.” (Emphasis supplied) 25 (a) 21. Applying the above observations of this Court, would mean that the power of the GEAC, to grant approvals, necessarily carries with it the power to regulate the manner, in which the approvals are so granted. The mere absence of a specific statement in the 1989 Rules allowing assistance of expert committees, would not preclude the GEAC from doing so, in furtherance of its main objective. 25 (a) 22. Reference must also be made to the decision of this Court in Inspector General of Registration v. K. Baskaran (2-Judge Bench),17 wherein after consideration of a number of s concluded as under: “14. The following principles can thus be culled out from the decisions of this Court: (i) A statutory functionary exercising a power cannot be said to have delegated his functions merely by deputing a responsible and competent official to enquire and report, as that is the ordinary mode of exercise of any administrative power; (ii) If a statutory authority empowers a delegate to undertake preparatory work, and to take an initial decision in matters entrusted to it, but retains in its own hands the power to approve or disapprove the decision after it has been taken, the 17 [2020] 11 SCR 345 : (2020) 14 SCC 345 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
