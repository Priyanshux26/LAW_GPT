The custody on the date of remand is distinct from the arrest of an accused under Section 56 CrPC as that is considered as a period prior to production G before the Magistrate. By this logic, even if the accused is under custody it would neither be under Section 56, nor under 167(2) of the CrPC. This will lead to an apparent legal vacuum. This can however be avoided if 22 Econ Antri Ltd. vs. Rom Industries [(2014) 11 SCC 769] 23 Saketh India Ltd. vs. India Securities Ltd. (1999) 3 SCC 1 H 942 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A the remand period is considered from the very day of the remand . Furthermore, if an accused is remanded by a Magistrate on say, 01.01.2023, then, the police, post judicial scrutiny, is empowered to investigate, starting on the same day, as per Section 167 CrPC, irrespective of whether the police actually commence investigation on the same day. So, if the police is empowered to investigate an accused person on the B day of the remand itself, the 60/90 day stipulated period, upon whose expiry, the right of default bail accrues to the accused, should logically be calculated from that day itself. Ignoring the date of remand under Section 167 CrPC in the 60/90 day period, would in our opinion, militate against the legislative intent of providing an accused protection C from being in prolonged custody, because of slothful investigation. 37. In Rakesh Kumar Paul vs. State of Assam24 a three-judge Bench of this Court while examining the ratio in Union of India vs. Nirala Yadav25 and Uday Mohanlal Acharya vs. State of Maharashtra,26observed that on the expiry of the 60/90 day period as D the case may be, an indefeasible right accrues in favour of the accused for being released on bail on account of default by the investigating agency in completion of the investigation within the prescribed period. The opinion in Sanjay Dutt Vs. Bombay through C.B.I.27 was also considered, wherein the Constitution Bench laid down that if the chargesheet is not filed and the right for “default bail” has ripened into E the status of indefeasibility, such right cannot be frustrated by the prosecution. 38. Similarly in Bikramjit Singh vs. State of Punjab28 a three- Judge bench observed, that the right to secure a default bail under the first proviso to Section 167 (2) of the Code is a part of the procedure F established by law under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, the right therein is raised to the status of a fundament right. The Court in this context observed that while considering the consequences that flow towards liberty of an accused, it is immaterial whether the accused makes a written or an oral application for default bail and the Court is only G required to deal with such an application by considering the statutory requirements, namely, whether the statutory period for filing a chargesheet 24 (2017) 15 SCC 67 25 (2014) 9 SCC 457 26 (2001) 5 SCC 453 27 1994 (5) SCC 410 H 28 (2020) 10 SCC 616 ENFORCEMENT DIRECTORATE, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA v. 943 KAPIL WADHAWAN & ANR.
