– Further, s relied upon by the APTEL, specifically the dtd. 19.11.2018, clarified that the State Commission was to decide the tariff u/s.63 having regard to the law laid down both statutorily and by this Court – As such, the State Commission was bound to take into consideration the Bidding Guidelines notified by the Central Government, and specifically clause 5.15 thereof – State Commission justified in considering the Clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines which specifically permits to reject all price bids if the rates quoted are not aligned to the prevailing market prices – APTEL grossly erred in holding that the State Commission has no power to go into the question, as to whether the prices quoted are market aligned or not and also not to take into consideration the aspect of consumers’ interest – It cannot be read from the s of this Court that the State Commission was bound to accept the bids as quoted by the bidders till the bucket was filled – No such direction can be issued by this Court de hors the provisions of ss.63 and 86(1)(b) and the Bidding Guidelines – Since the decision-making process adopted by the Bid Evaluation Committee approved by the State Commission, was in accordance with the law laid down by this Court, the same ought not to have been interfered with by the APTEL – High Court could not have issued a mandamus to the instrumentalities of the State to enter into a contract harmful to the public interest inasmuch as, if the power was to be procured by the procurers at the rates quoted by the respondent No.1, which was even higher than the rates quoted by the L-5 bidder, then the [2024] 1 S.C.R. 911 Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v.
