Digital Supreme Court Reports subsequent sale transactions, earlier round of litigations etc. are concerned, it is noted that the landowners and affected parties are under no obligation to either confirm or deny the allegations levelled against them – Nor this Court has directed the appellants to furnish original records or documents to substantiate their claim of concealment and suppression of material facts – Engaging in a factual inquiry at such an advanced stage of the legal process, especially without providing adequate opportunities to all parties, may not be fair – The cases listed in Group E involve complex questions of fact and this Court being the Court of the last resort, ought not to be involved in such elaborate factfinding exercise – Therefore, deem it appropriate to remit these cases to the High Court for proper adjudication on points of law as well as facts. [Paras 42, 44, 45, 46, 48] Doctrine/Principles – Res judicata – discussed. Doctrine/Principles – Doctrine of merger – Exception: Held: This Court takes notice of the exception carved out by this Court in Kunhayammed, to the effect that the doctrine of merger is not of universal or unlimited application and that the nature of jurisdiction exercised by the superior forum and the content or subject matter of challenge laid or which could have been laid shall have to be kept in view – The exception that has been carved out in Kunhayammed, will only be permissible in the rarest of rare cases and such a deviation can be invoked sparingly only – However, among such exceptions, the extraordinary constitutional powers vested in this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, which is to be exercised with a view to do complete justice between the parties, remains unaffected and being an unfettered power, shall always be deemed to be preserved as an exception to the doctrine of merger and the rule of stare decisis. [Para 33] Public Interest – Land Acquisition – Elements of Public interest: Held: a) While balancing the interest of the public exchequer against that of individuals, there are many other interests at stake, and it might not be possible to undo the acquisitions without causing significant cascading harms and losses to such other interests; b) Since development projects have either begun or most of the acquired lands have already been deployed for essential public projects such as hospitals, schools, expansion of metro, etc., the [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1163 Government of NCT of Delhi & Anr. v. M/s BSK Realtors LLP & Anr. effect of non-condonation of delay would go beyond mere financial loss to the exchequer and would extend to the public at large; c) It would be like unscrambling the egg if compensation paid would have to be clawed back or possession taken would have to be reversed; d) In many cases, the development projects might also have to be undone – The reversal of possession of even a small plot lying on projects such as an under-construction metro corridor would be practically impossible; e) These are the cases where rights are vested to the public at large given the public infrastructure that has come up on a large number of acquired lands; f) The fresh acquisition, if so is required to be done by the State, would be at the expense of delaying the construction of critical public infrastructure in our national capital – When balancing public with private interest, the comparative interest on the landowners would be nominal as compared to the public at large; and g) The multiplicity of contradictory judicial opinions on section 24 (2) of the 2013 Act has made the present set of circumstances sui generis – The constant flux in the legal position of law has posed significant challenges for the State and its authorities.
