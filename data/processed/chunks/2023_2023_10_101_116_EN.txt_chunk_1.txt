It is, therefore, those products of millets specifically indicated, which are entitled to exemption under Section 8 of the Act read with Schedule III as per Exemption Entry No.8. [Para D 17][113-F-H; 114-A] 2. Can maize starch be considered a millet product, as in Exemption Entry No.8, for the present purpose? This Court does not think so. Maize is the raw product, whereas maize starch is a processed product. While we are bound to hold that maize is E entitled to exemption in terms of Exemption Entry No.8 as it stood prior to the relevant assessment year, maize starch being a product of maize derived through mechanical process, it cannot be read as “like maize”, the “like” having been excluded by Act No. 32 of 1994. Maize starch being a kind of starch, it is covered by Taxation Entry No. 61 as introduced by Act No.37 of 1996 F which is to the effect “… starch of any kind”. The dictionary meaning of the word “any” is “one or same or all”. In Black’s Law Dictionary, it is explained that the word ‘any’ has diverse meaning and may be employed to indicate ‘all’ or ‘every’ as well as ‘same’ or ‘one’ and its meaning in a given statute depends G upon the context and subject matter of the statute. Had the legislature intended to exclude any starch, including maize starch, a specific provision excluding it would have been made. [Para 18][114-B-D] 3. Trite to say, the Legislature may not have intended two entries for the self- same commodity, one under the exempted H SANTHOSH MAIZE & INDUSTRIES LIMITED v. THE STATE 103 OF TAMIL NADU & ANR. category and the other under the taxable entry. Therefore, maize A starch has to be either covered by Taxation Entry No.61 or Exemption Entry No.8. Taxation Entry No.61 provides a more specific description and maize starch undoubtedly being a ‘kind of starch’ would, therefore, be comprehended in it. This is more so because what is covered by Exemption Entry No.8 is maize, B which is a product of millet. The position would have been otherwise if Exemption Entry No.8 or any other entry in Schedule III carried the description of product of maize instead of ‘product of millet’.
