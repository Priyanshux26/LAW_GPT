The plaintiff was also authorized to carry out development work and to make construction of common passage, drain, etc. in the meantime and to collect money from the proposed buyers of the plots to be developed. 2.2. In due course, a sale deed would be executed by defendant no.1 in favour of the nominees or the plaintiff and in such sales, the plaintiff would be a confirming party. The said exercise was to be completed within one year.
