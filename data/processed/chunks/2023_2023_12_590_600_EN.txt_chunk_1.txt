The assessee is a multi-State Co-operative Society registered in India, under the administrative control of the Department of Fertilizers, Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operation, Government of India. In the course of its business of manufacturing fertilizers, it entered into a joint venture with Oman Oil Company to form the Oman Fertilizer Company SAOC (for short ’OMIFCO’ or ‘the JV’), a registered company in Oman under the Omani laws. The assessee has 25% share in the JV. The JV manufactures fertilizers, which are purchased by the Central Government. The assessee has a branch offi ce in Oman which is independently registered as company under the Omani laws having permanent establishment status in Oman in terms of Article 25 of the DTAA. The branch offi ce maintains its own books of account and submits returns of income under the Omani income tax laws. 5. The assessment for the relevant year was completed under Section 143 (3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short, ‘the Act’). The Assessing Offi cer allowed tax credit in respect of the dividend income received by the assessee from the JV. The dividend income was simultaneously brought to the charge of tax in the assessment as per the Indian tax laws. However, under the Omani tax laws, exemption was granted to the dividend income by virtue of the amendments made in the Omani tax laws w.e.f the year 2000. PRINCIPAL COMMISSION ER OF INCOME TAX-10 v. M/S KRISHAK 593 BHARTI COOPERATIVE LTD. [PRASHANT KUMAR MISHRA, J.] 6. The Assessing Offi cer allowed credit for the said tax, which would have been payable in Oman, but exemption was granted. Thereafter, the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax (for short, ‘PCIT’) issued a show cause notice under Section 263 of the Act on the ground that the reliance placed on Article 25(4) of DTAA was erroneous in this case and no tax credit was due to the assessee under Section 90 of the Act. This notice was duly replied to by the assessee.
