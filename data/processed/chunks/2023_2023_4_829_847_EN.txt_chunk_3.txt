[Paras 38, 40][843- F, H; 844-C-D] 1.7 The Investigating Officer did not meet the obligations he was under. Numerous infirmities affected the conduct of the C Investigation Officer calling into question, credibly, the investigation conducted by him or upon his directions. [Para 44][846-D] 1.8 The High Court, without appreciating the testimonies of the witnesses in their true import and meaning, and without D having any discussion concerning the complicity of the accused, in a perfunctory manner held the prosecution to have established the case, which is entirely circumstantial in nature, against the instant appellant. Significantly, the High Court holds that the evidence reveals that “in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused”. Inter alia, it is this finding which is E found to be erroneous, for the principle of determining the guilt of the accused in a case involving circumstantial evidence is not that of probability but certainty and that all the evidence present should conclusively point towards only a singular hypothesis, which is the guilt of the accused. The passed by the High Court is set aside. [Paras 45-46][846-E-H] F Vijay Shankar v. State of Haryana (2015) 12 SCC 644 : [2015] 9 SCR 977; D.K Basu v. State of WB (1997) 1 SCC 416 : [1996] 10 Suppl.
