It was then concluded that: “32. It is well settled that the provisions of the statute are to be read in the text and context in which they have been enacted. It is well settled that in construction of a statute an eff ort should be made to give eff ect to all the provisions contained therein. It is equally well settled that a statute should be interpreted equitably so as to avoid hardship. So interpreted the decision of this Court in Meera Gupta v. State of W.B. [(1992) 2 SCC 494] commends to us in preference of the decision of this Court in State of U.P. v. L.J. Johnson [(1983) 4 SCC 110]. Meera Gupta case [(1992) 2 SCC 494] has been followed by this Court in Atma Ram Aggarwal v. State of U.P. [1993 Supp (1) SCC 1] and Kunj Behari Lal v. District Judge, Gorakhpur [(1997) 6 SCC 257]. 33. We are not unmindful of the observations made by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Angoori Devi v. State of U.P. [(1997) 2 SCC 434] stating that the decisions of this Court in Johnson case [(1983) 4 SCC 110] and Meera Gupta case [(1992) 2 SCC 494] are in confl ict M/S. KEWAL COURT PVT. LTD. AND ANR. v. THE STATE 741 OF WEST BENGAL AND ORS. [SURYA KANT, J.] with each other and Johnson case [(1983) 4 SCC 110] should hold the fi eld. However, in Angoori Devi case [(1997) 2 SCC 434] the confl ict was not resolved by the Constitution Bench to which a reference was made by a three-Judge Bench in Angoori Devi v. State of U.P. [(1997) 7 SCC 757] 34. In view of our discussions aforementioned, it must be held that: (1) that the respondents having independent title to the property in question, are entitled to the two separate units under the said Act; (2) despite the fact that no construction had been raised on the appointed day, they are entitled to the benefi t under sub-clause (i) of clause (q) of Section 2 of the Act; and (3) for the purpose of determination of the ceiling limit, the area of the fl ats belonging to the respondents in Bombay would not be taken into consideration. I, thus, agree with the conclusion arrived at by the High Court.” [emphasis applied] 32. Shri Jaideep Gupta, learned Senior Counsel for the appellants strongly relied upon Billimoria5 as a binding precedent on the interpretation of Section 2(q)(i) and urged to remit the case to the Competent Authority to re-determine the ‘vacant land’ in the hands of the appellants after excluding the area on which no construction is permissible under the Building Regulations of Calcutta Municipal Corporation. On the other hand, Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel for the respondents strenuously urged that the outcome in Billimoria5 was largely infl uenced by the fact that there were two joint owners of the subject property who were held entitled to their separate units under the Ceiling Act and each such unit was required to exclude 2/3rd area where construction was impermissible and after such exclusion, what was left in the hands of Billimoria or Kapadia was defi nitely less than the retainable land measuring 1000 sq.m.
