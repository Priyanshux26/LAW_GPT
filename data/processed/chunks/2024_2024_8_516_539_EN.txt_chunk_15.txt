It is indeed relevant to note that the appellants’ batch seems to be the last in their genre of SSD Fund temporary employees and thus, manifestly, the direction to extend the benefits of the 6th CPC and the RP Rules to the appellants shall not form a precedent so as to have a detrimental effect on the financial health of the SSD Fund. 35. In the wake of the discussion made hereinabove, we are of the view that the impugned rendered by the High Court does not stand to scrutiny and the same is unsustainable in the eyes of law and is set aside. 36. The respondents are directed to extend the benefits of the 6th Central Pay Commission including the pensionary benefits under the Revised Pay Scale Rules, 2008 to the appellants herein in the same terms as are being afforded to their peers in the Accounts Section of SFF HQ Estt. No. 22. 37. The appeal is allowed in these terms. No costs. 38. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
