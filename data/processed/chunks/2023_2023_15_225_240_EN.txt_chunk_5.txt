9. In the words of Krishna Iyer J., (as His Lordship then was) “a plea of review, unless the fi rst judicial view is manifestly distorted, is like asking for the Moon. A forensic defeat cannot be avenged by an invitation to have a second look, hopeful of discovery of fl aws and reversal of result……… A review in the Counsel’s mentation cannot repair the verdict once given. So, the law laid down must rest in peace.”2 1 (2019) 18 SCC 586, Union of India vs. Nareshkumar Badrikumar Jagad & Others 2 (1980) 2 SCC 167, M/s. Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. vs. Lt. Governor of Delhi SANJAY KUMAR AGARWAL v. STATE TAX OFFICER (1) & 233 ANR. [BELA M. TRIVEDI, J.] 10. It is also well settled that a party is not entitled to seek a review of a delivered by this Court merely for the purpose of a rehearing and a fresh decision of the case. The normal principle is that a pronounced by the Court is fi nal, and departure from that principle is justifi ed only when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character make it necessary to do so.3 11. In P arsion Devi and Others vs. Sumitri Devi and Others4, this Court made very pivotal observations: - “9. Under 47 Rule 1 CPC a may be open to review inter alia if there is a mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record. An error which is not self-evident and has to be detected by a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record justifying the court to exercise its power of review under 47 Rule 1 CPC. In exercise of the jurisdiction under 47 Rule 1 CPC it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be “reheard and corrected”. A review petition, it must be remembered has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be “an appeal in disguise.” 12. Again, in Shanti Conductors Private Limited vs. Assam State Electricity Board and Others5, a three Judge Bench of this Court following Parsion Devi and Others vs. Sumitri Devi and Others (supra) dismissed the review petitions holding that the scope of review is limited and under the guise of review, the petitioner cannot be permitted to reagitate and reargue the questions which have already been addressed and decided. 13. Recently, in Shri Ram Sahu (Dead) Through Legal Representatives and Others vs. Vinod Kumar Rawat and Others6, this Court restated the law with regard to the scope of review under Section 114 read with XLVII of CPC. 3 AIR 1965 SC 845, Sajjan Singh and Ors. vs. State of Rajasthan and Ors. 4 (1997) 8 SCC 715 5 (2020) 2 SCC 677 6 (2021) 13 SCC 1 234 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 14. In R.P. (C) Nos. 1273-1274 of 2021 in Civil Appeal Nos. 8345- 8346 of 2018 (Arun Dev Upadhyaya vs. Integrated Sales Service Limited & Another), this Court reiterated the law and held that: - “15.
