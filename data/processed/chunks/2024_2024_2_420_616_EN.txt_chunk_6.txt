Digital Supreme Court Reports Doctrines/Principles — Principle of proportionality — Test of proportionality — Proportionality standard to balance two conflicting fundamental rights — Foreign vis-a-vis Indian jurisprudence: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Cul, (for himself and for 8 R Gavai, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, JJ): Foreign case *Campbell v MGM Limited adopts a double proportionality standard — It employed a three step approach to balance fundamental rights, first step to analyse the comparative importance of the actual rights claimed, second step to lay down the justifications for the infringement of the rights, and third to apply the proportionality standard to both the rights — Said approach must be slightly tempered to suit Indian jurisprudence on proportionality — Indian Courts adopt a four prong structured proportionality standard to test the infringement of the fundamental rights — In the last stage, the Court undertakes a balancing exercise, wherein the Court undertakes an analysis of the comparative importance of the considerations involved in the case, the justifications for the infringement of the rights, and if the effect of infringement of one right is proportional to achieve the goal — Thus, the first two steps laid down in Campbell case are subsumed within the balancing prong of the proportionality analysis. [Paras 154, 156] — Held: (per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) Test of proportionality employed by courts in various jurisdictions like Germany, Canada, South Africa, Australia and the United Kingdom, however, no uniformity on application of test of proportionality or the method of using the last two prongs — In the third prong, courts examine whether the restriction is necessary to achieve the desired end, wherein they consider whether a less intrusive alternative is available to achieve the same ends, aiming for minimal impairment — As regards, the fourth prong, the balancing stage, some jurists believe that balancing is ambiguous and value-based, which stems from the premise of rule-based legal adjudication, where courts determine entitlements rather than balancing interests — However, proportionality is a standard-based review rather than a rule-based one — Balancing stage enables judges to consider various factors by analysing them against the standards proposed by the four prongs of proportionality — This ensures that all aspects of a case are carefully weighed in decision-making — While balancing is integral to the standard of proportionality, such an exercise should be rooted in empirical [2024] 2 S.C.R. 429 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. data and evidence as adopted by most of the countries — In the absence of data and figures, there is a lack of standards by which proportionality stricto sensu can be determined — However many of the constitutional courts have employed the balancing stage ‘normatively’ by examining the weight of the seriousness of the right infringement against the urgency of the factors that justify it — Findings of empirical legal studies provide a more solid foundation for normative reasoning and enhance understanding of the relationship between means and ends — Proportionality analyses would be more accurate and would lead to better and more democratic governance.
