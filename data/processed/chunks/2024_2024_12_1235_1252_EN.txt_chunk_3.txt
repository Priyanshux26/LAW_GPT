The Tribunal, by its dated 17.04.2018, dismissed the appellants’ plea. It concluded that the appellants were not engaged on what it considered “regular vacancies,” that they had not completed what it termed as sufficient “full-time” service (such as meeting a 240-days per year criterion), and that their case did not attract the principles enabling regularization. Within ten days after the dismissal of the original application, on 17.04.2018, the services of all these individuals were abruptly terminated on 27.10.2018 by the respondent authorities without issuance of any show-cause notice. 6. Aggrieved by the Tribunal’s decision and subsequent termination, the appellants approached the High Court in W.P. (C) No. 6822 of 2018 praying for the following reliefs: “a) Setting aside and quashing the impugned dated 17.04.2018 passed by the Hon’ble Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi in O.A. No. 2211/2015 titled as Smt. Anita & Ors. Versus Union of India & Ors., and b) Directing the respondents to reinstate the petitioners to their posts held by them prior to their illegal termination on 27.04.2018 and further to regularize the services of all the petitioners in their respective posts, from the date of their initial appointments with all the consequential benefits, in the interest of justice. c) Issue the writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, direction, or , as this Hon›ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case, in favor of the petitioners and against the respondents.” 7. They urged the High Court to recognize their long and continuous service, the nature of their work, and the lack of any backdoor or illegal entry. They highlighted that they had functioned without any break, performed tasks equivalent to regular employees, and had been assigned duties essential to the regular upkeep, cleanliness, and maintenance of the respondent’s offices. The High Court, after examining the Tribunal’s decision and the [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1241 Jaggo v. Union of India & Ors. submissions advanced, concluded that the petitioners before it were part-time workers who had not been appointed against sanctioned posts, nor had they performed a sufficient duration of full-time service to satisfy the criteria for regularization. It relied on the principle laid down in Secretary, State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi3 holding that the petitioners could not claim a vested right to be absorbed or regularized without fulfilling the requisite conditions. The High Court further observed that the petitioners did not possess the minimum educational qualifications ordinarily required for regular appointments, and additionally noted that the employer had subsequently outsourced the relevant housekeeping and maintenance activities. Concluding that there was no legal basis to grant the reliefs sought, the High Court dismissed the writ petition. Aggrieved by this rejection, the appellants have approached this Court by way of these appeals. 8. On behalf of the appellants, the following arguments have been advanced before us: (i). Continuous and Substantive Engagement: The appellants emphasize their long, uninterrupted service spanning well over a decade—and in some instances, exceeding two decades.
