the State VAT Act – It was sought to be argued that once the State Legislature approved the ordinance and enacted the amendment, in conformity with it, the provisions of the Ordinance became part of the act – The question of legislative competence would not arise, because the mere confi rmation of an ordinance is within the competence of the State legislature – Since the law was introduced through a diff erent procedure, i.e. ordinance, the eff ect of that law, empowering the VAT offi cials to reopen or complete assessments, was no diff erent – The state of Telangana had argued to the contrary, and 144 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. explained that when the ordinance was issued, there was no doubt about the state possessing legislative competence – As of that date (17.06.2017) the power to amend existing laws, was permissible u/s. 19 of the Amendment – However, that argument is not tenable, because the ordinance’s validity and eff ect might not have been suspect on the date of its promulgation; yet, the issue is that on the date when it was in fact, approved and given shape as an amendment, the State legislature had ceased to possess the power – By that time, the State GST and the Central GST Acts had come into force (on 01.07.2017) – Therefore, Section 19 ceased to be eff ective – The original entry (Entry 54 of the State List) ceased to exist – In the circumstances, the state legislature had no legislative competence to enact the amendment, which approved the ordinance, which consequently was rendered void. [Paras 102, 105] Constitution of India – Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, 2016 – Gujarat Act: Held: In the Gujarat batch of cases, s.84A was introduced in the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003 by the Gujarat Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 2018, gazetted on 06.04.2018 but with retrospective eff ect from 1.4.2006 – It inter-alia provided that if for a particular issue in “some other proceedings” a lower forum, gave a decision which is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue and an appeal against such decision is pending before the higher forum then the period spent in such litigation will be excluded while computing period of limitation for revision – By giving such provision retrospective eff ect the State legislature thus sought to enable reopening of assessments which had already attained fi nality – The Gujarat High Court struck down the amendment on the ground of lack of legislative competence, on the part of the legislature, after 01.07.2017, and also that it was manifestly arbitrary – In the instant case, the retrospective eff ect, given to the amendment, which was brought into force, with eff ect from 2006, cannot in any way save it, after the coming into force of the GST laws, on 01.07.2017 – Nor can there can be any argument that the amendment made in February, 2018, is traceable to Article 246A – The amendments in question, made to the Gujarat VAT Act after 01.07.2017 were correctly held void, for want of legislative competence, by the High Court of Gujarat.
