161 of the Evidence Act, the benefit conferred thereunder along with the benefit of s.172(3) of CrPC has to be extended to an accused – Thus, the accused has a right to cross-examine a police officer as to the recording made in the case diary whenever the police officer uses it to refresh his memory – Though s.161 of the Evidence Act does not restrict itself to a case of refreshing memory by perusing a case diary alone, there is no exclusion for doing so – Similarly, in a case where the court uses a case diary for the purpose of contradicting a police officer, then an accused is entitled to peruse the said statement so recorded which is relevant, and cross-examine the police officer on that count – What is relevant in such a case is the process of using it for the purpose of contradiction and not the conclusion – To make the position clear, though s.145 r/w. s.161 of the Evidence Act deals with the right of a party including an accused, such a right is limited and restrictive when it is applied to s.172 of CrPC – Suffice it is to state,that the said right cannot be declined when the author of a case diary uses it to refresh 778 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports his memory or the court uses it for the purpose of contradiction – Therefore, there is no hesitation in holding that s.145 and s.161 of the Evidence Act on the one hand and s.172(3) of CrPC on the other are to be read in consonance with each other, subject to the limited right conferred under sub-section (3) of s.172 of CrPC. [Paras 20, 26, 27] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – First Information Report vis-a-vis Case Diary: Held: In Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh & Others, the Supreme Court held that an Information disclosing commission of a cognizable offence shall first be entered in a book kept by the officer in charge of police station and not in the General Diary – A General Diary entry cannot precede the registration of FIR, except in cases where preliminary inquiry is needed – While an FIR is to be registered on an information disclosing the commission of a cognizable offence, so also a recording is thereafter required to be made in the case diary. [Para 28] Evidence Act, 1872 – s. 165 – Judge’s power to put questions or production: Held: S.165 of the Evidence Act speaks of the power of the court to put questions and production of documents in the course of trial – This is a general and omnibus power given to the court when in search of the truth – Such a power is to be exercised against any witness before it, both in a civil as well as a criminal case – The object is to discover adequate proof of a relevant fact and, therefore, for that purpose, the Judge is authorised and empowered to ask any question of his choice – When such a power is exercised by the court, there is no corresponding right that can be extended to a party to cross-examine any witness on an answer given in reply to a question put forth by it, except with its leave.
