A person not only suffers injuries on account of accident but also suffers in mind and body on account of the accident through out his life and a feeling is developed that his no more a normal man and cannot enjoy the amenities of life as another normal person can. While fixing compensation for pain and suffering as also for loss of amenities, features like his age, marital status and unusual deprivation he has undertaken in his life have to be reckoned.” 14.3 In Kajal v. Jagdish Chand 21 considering the facts of the case, i.e., 100% disability, child being bedridden for life, her mental age being that of a nine-month-old for life - a vegetative existence, held that “even after taking a conservative view of the matter an amount payable for the ‘pain and suffering’ of this child should be at least Rs.15,00,000/-.” 14.4 In Ayush v. Reliance General Insurance 22 relying on Kajal (supra) the amount awarded in ‘pain and suffering’ was enhanced to Rs.10,00,000. The child who had suffered the accident was five years old and the Court noted in paragraph 2 that : 19 [2022] 8 SCR 403 : (2023) 3 SCC 439 20 [2003] Supp. 2 SCR 14 : (2003) 7 SCC 197 21 [2020] 3 SCR 622 : (2020) 4 SCC 413 22 [2022] 1 SCR 831 : (2022) 7 SCC 738 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 849 K.S. Muralidhar v. R. Subbulakshmi & Anr. “As per the discharge certificate, the appellant is not able to move both his legs and had complete sensory loss in the legs, urinary incontinence, bowel constipation and bed sores. The appellant was aged about 5 years as on the date of the accident, hence has lost his childhood and is dependent on others for his routine work.” 14.5 In Lalan (supra) cited by the claimant-appellant, the Tribunal awarded Rs.30,000/- which was enhanced to Rs.40,000/- by the High Court. Considering the fact that the appellant therein has suffered extensive brain injury awarded compensation under ‘pain and suffering’ to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/-. 15. Keeping in view the above-referred s, the injuries suffered, the ‘pain and suffering’ caused, and the life-long nature of the disability afflicted upon the claimant-appellant, and the statement of the Doctor as reproduced above, we find the request of the claimant-appellant to be justified and as such, award Rs.15,00,000/- under the head ‘pain and suffering’, fully conscious of the fact that the prayer of the claimant–appellant for enhancement of compensation was by a sum of Rs.10,00,000/-, we find the compensation to be just, fair and reasonable at the amount so awarded. 16. It stands clarified that we have modified the Award, as given by the High Court, only on two counts, i.e., future prospects and ‘pain and suffering’. The amount as enhanced, shall carry interest @ 6%, from the date of filing of the petition for special leave to appeal. According to paragraph 10, the compensation to be awarded stood at Rs.87,29,241/-. Consequent to the above discussion on ‘pain and suffering’, the total amount now payable is Rs.1,02,29,241/-.
