However, it was withdrawn on 23.08.2022 on the fear of arrest. Thereupon, the Trial Court fixed the date for appearance of the appellants on 30.08.2022. Before the date fixed for their appearance, the appellants filed application for anticipatory bail before the Sessions Court and, thereafter on 06.09.2022, informed the Trial Court about its listing before the Sessions Court on 27.09.2022 for final hearing. The Trial Court thereupon posted the matter for appearance of the appellants to 11.10.2022. The anticipatory bail moved by the appellants was dismissed on 27.09.2022 and thereupon, the Trial Court took up the matter on 03.11.2022. Since the appellants remained absent, the Trial Court issued non-bailable warrants and listed the matter to 04.11.2022 for their production. Meanwhile, the appellants herein approached the High Court by filing CRLM No.67668 of 2022 seeking anticipatory bail. It is to be noted that non-bailable warrants were pending against 430 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports them when they moved the said application for anticipatory bail. On 04.12.2022, on behalf of the appellants, the Trial Court was informed about the filing of anticipatory bail application before the High Court. Consequently, the matter was listed on 04.01.2023. On 04.01.2023, pursuant to the non-appearance of the appellants despite the earlier for their appearance and the issuance of non-bailable warrants, the Trial Court issued proclamation under Section 82(1), Cr. PC. Later, proceedings under Section 83, Cr.PC were also initiated. On 15.03.2023, on behalf of the appellants it was prayed to postpone the process under Section 82/83, Cr. PC. However, the Trial Court proceeded to issue the process under Section 83, Cr. PC, based on the proclamation under Section 82(1) Cr.PC. On 04.04.2023, the application for anticipatory bail filed by the appellants was dismissed, obviously taking note of the proceedings under Sections 82/83, Cr. PC and observing that owing to such developments the application for pre-arrest bail could not be maintained. 15. The core contention of the appellants is that the rejection of the application for anticipatory bail without considering the application on merits for the reason of issuance of proclamation under Section 82, Cr. PC, is unsustainable. It is the further contended that at no stage, the appellants were “evading the arrest” or “absconding” but were only exercising their legal right to seek anticipatory bail. It is in the aforesaid circumstances that the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants raised the contention that when an application for anticipatory bail is pending, the issuance of proclamation, following issuance of non-bailable warrant could not be a reason for non- considering the application for anticipatory bail on merits. 16. For a proper consideration of the aforesaid contentions and allied questions, it is only appropriate to refer to certain provisions of law as also certain relevant decisions. From the chronology of events narrated hereinbefore, it is evident that for reasons best known to the appellants, subsequent to the filing of the final report in terms of the provisions under Section 173 (2), Cr.P.C in FIR No.79/2020 and issuance of summons, issuance of bailable warrants and issuance of non-bailable warrants; pursuant to the failure of the appellants to appear before the Court on the date fixed for their appearance based on bailable warrants, they did not care to take any action in accordance with law except moving applications for bail.
