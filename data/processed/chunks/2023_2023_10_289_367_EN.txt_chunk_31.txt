20. It is contended that the petitioners are being subjected to continued discrimination and are being assessed to income tax, even G though they are also eligible for the exemption under Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961. That, in spite of various representations which have been made, the completely discriminatory and arbitrary amendments made to the I.T. Act, 1961 have still not been done away with. In fact, further recovery notices for recovery of tax have been sent to some of H 330 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A the persons who are members of petitioner No.1 Association in W.P. (C) No. 59 of 2013. Therefore, in the above circumstances, being aggrieved by the amendment by which clause (26AAA) to Section 10 of the I.T.
