It does not seem to have realised that the burden of proving that he was not a foreigner, was on the respondent and appears to have placed that burden on the Union. This was a wholly wrong approach to the question.’ 52. However, the above conclusion was premised on what the Court noted in the preceding paragraph in Ghaus Mohammad (supra): ‘2. The High Court observed that: “There must be prima facie material on the basis of which the authority can proceed to pass an under Section 3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act, 1946. No doubt if there exists such a material and then the is made which is on the face of it a valid , then this Court cannot go into the [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2361 Md. Rahim Ali @ Abdur Rahim v. The State of Assam & Ors. question whether or not a particular person is a foreigner or, in other words, not a citizen of this country because according to Section 9 of the Citizenship Act, 1955, this question is to be decided by a prescribed authority and under the Citizenship Rules, 1956, that authority is the Central Government”. The High Court then examined the materials before it and held, “in the present case there was no material at all on the basis of which the proper authority could proceed to issue an under Section 3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act, 1946”. In this view of the matter the High Court quashed the .’ 53. We need not be detained on Ghaus Mohammad (supra) as it is clear that therein, the Punjab High Court (Circuit Bench) at Delhi had conflated the Act with the Citizenship Act. Fateh Mohd. v Delhi Administration, 1963 Supp (2) SCR 560 by a 4-Judge Bench and Masud Khan v State of Uttar Pradesh (1974) 3 SCC 469 [3-Judge Bench] followed Ghaus Mohammad (supra). We are of the opinion that the facts therein were also different than what stares us in the case at hand. No doubt the principles of law stand, yet we see no real difficulty in our formulations hereinabove harmonising with what has been held in the gamut of case-law. As such, the burden under Section 9 of the Act would operate in the manner delineated by us, factoring in the imperative to maintain consistency amongst Ghaus Mohammad (supra), Sarbananda Sonowal I (supra), Sarbananda Sonowal II (supra), Mukesh Singh (supra) and this . 54. For and on the strength of the totality of reasons afore-indicated, this Court finds that the report/opinion of the Tribunal dated 16.11.2017, as sought by this Court through dated 28.07.2017,13 is wholly unsustainable. Accordingly, the report/opinion dated 16.11.2017 is quashed. As the report/opinion dated 16.11.2017 has been examined threadbare by us, we have no hesitation in setting aside the Tribunal’s dated 19.03.2012 as also the Impugned 13 ‘In the peculiar facts of the case, we would request the Foreign Tribunal, Nalbari, to examine the documents filed by the petitioner on the basis of which the petitioner is claiming that he is not a foreigner but a national of this country.
