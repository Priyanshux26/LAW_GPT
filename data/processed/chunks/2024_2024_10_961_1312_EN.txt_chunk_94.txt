(b) Administrative convenience: Further, the immigrants who migrated before 1966 were added to the electoral rolls prepared as on 01.01.1966. These rolls served as the nearest definite document that could be drawn upon to determine citizenship, especially with a view to desist from disturbing the status quo amidst the large-scale migration and consequent settlement of people before 01.01.1966.170 It was also administratively convenient to select this cut-off date because of the impracticality of requesting documents from individuals who migrated much earlier, such as in 1951. Although 1961 was initially proposed as the cut-off date, but after due deliberations, eventually, the cut-off date of 01.01.1966 was agreed to, and thus, the period before and after 1966 was dealt with in a differential manner. 229. It can thus be concluded that the date of 01.01.1966 was not set arbitrarily but based on proper application of mind. 230. As regards to the reasoning behind the cut-off date of 25.03.1971, the same can be traced to the launch of Operation Searchlight by Pakistan, an event which also marked the onset of the Bangladesh Liberation War. Subsequently, on the very next day, on 26.03.1971, Bangladesh officially declared independence. In response to these developments, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh committed to “by every means, the return of all the refugees who had taken shelter in India since March 25, 1971, and to strive, by every means to safeguard their safety, human dignity and livelihood”.171 231. Soon thereafter, the President of Bangladesh promulgated the Bangladesh Citizenship (Temporary Provisions) , 1972, on 15.12.1972, with retrospective validity from 26.03.1971.

[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1097 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 essentially introduced a framework of constituent citizenship, signifying the initial acquisition of citizenship through the operation of the law. The 1972 put forth a discernible distinction and provided citizenship from 25.03.1971, ameliorating the issue of statelessness. Since the war had ended and a new nation was formed on 25.03.1971, the concern regarding providing citizenship based on humanitarian grounds was also assuaged. This appears to be the rationale behind prescribing the date of 25.03.1971 as a cut-off for obtaining citizenship in India. 232. This background indicates that the cut-off dates in Section 6A were not incorporated in a vacuous manner but were a result of considerable deliberation and discussion, and were also backed by a well-considered rationale. Furthermore, keeping in mind the humanitarian considerations that would have gone into the grant of citizenship under Section 6A, we cannot hold that the rationale behind the cut-off dates militates against any constitutional values or the concept of constitutional morality. Instead, Section 6A acknowledged the political and social realities of that period along with the impracticability of reversing the changes that had occurred. 233. Nevertheless, and as noted earlier, the determination of a cut- off date falls within the ambit of the policy makers and the Court would be reluctant to impinge into such fixation, save and except when the assigned date is vitiated with discriminatory and arbitrary considerations.
