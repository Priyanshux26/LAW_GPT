[Paras 7.4 and 11][70-E-F; 75-D] 3. It is required to be noted that in the present case, the allegations in the FIR, right from very beginning, were against D the accused No. 13, who at the relevant time was the sitting Cabinet Minister occupying the high position. Even at the relevant time, when the State Police investigated the FIR bearing No. 120 of 2020, in the first chargesheet and the second chargesheet did not name the accused No. 13. Even the investigation was also conducted in a perfunctory manner. The E real investigation started only after the intervention of the High Court and after passing various s in the present proceedings by the High Court. The allegations in the FIR were very serious including the misuse of powers by the sitting Cabinet Minister and of abducting, kidnapping and beating the complainant. [Para F 12.1][75-G-H; 76-A-B] 4. Be that as it may,even according to the State investigating agency, the further investigation is required. As observed and held by this Court in its various decisions, the victim has a fundamental right of fair investigation and fair trial. Therefore, mere filing of the chargesheet and framing of the charges cannot G be an impediment in ing further investigation / re- investigation / de novo investigation, if the facts so warrant. [Para 12.3][77-B] 5. The endeavour of the Court should be to have the fair investigation and fair trial only. Therefore, in the facts and H 58 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A circumstances of the case narrated hereinabove, this Court is of the opinion that a case is made out for further investigation and the State agency may be permitted to conduct a further investigation and to bring on record the further material, which may be in the furtherance of fair investigation and fair trial.
