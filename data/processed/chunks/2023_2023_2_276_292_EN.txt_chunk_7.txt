C 22. It will be pertinent to refer to the medical examination of accused No. 11 Naresh Kumar conducted by Dr. Anita Verma (PW-10). The injuries sustained by him are thus: • “Lacerated wound of 6x1x0.5 cm on the left parietal region of scalp. D • Multiple contusions on the back, left shoulder, left arm, varying in size from 5 to 20 cm in length and 2 to 4 cm in breath. • Abrasion of 3x0.5 cm on left leg. • Swelling, tenderness and deformity on prox.

PW-14, IO admits that in the merg intimation report, the names of Nand Lal, Bhagwat and Ramdular, i.e., accused Nos. 8 to 10 respectively are not mentioned. He further admits that in the spot panchnama also, their names are not mentioned. He admits in his cross- H 286 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A examination that in Ex.

He further admits that Naresh Kumar was taken from Police Station to the doctor for examination at 11.45 PM. B 24. It can thus be seen from the evidence of PW-14, IO that the police had information about the incident at least prior to 11.45 PM on 3rdNovember 2006. No doubt that mere delay in registering FIR would not be fatal to the prosecution case. The effect of delay in lodging the FIR would differ in the facts and circumstances of each case. In the C present case, admittedly, accused No.11 Naresh Kumar had received grievous injuries which have not been explained by the prosecution.
