But Abuzar Hossain (supra) deals with the context in which inquiry shall be directed under the 2000 G Act and Rules made thereunder. This authority does not come into conflict with ratio of the decision in the case of Ashwani Kumar Saxena (supra), to the extent the latter explains the meaning and implication of the expression “inquiry” under the 2000 Act and Rules made thereunder. The aim of such inquiry obviously is to determine the juvenility of the H claimant. So far as Section 94 of the 2015 Act is concerned, though the NARAYAN CHETANRAM CHAUDHARY v. THE STATE OF 1101 MAHARASHTRA [ANIRUDDHA BOSE, J.] said provision deals with determination of age of a juvenile-claimant by A the Committee or the Board, in our opinion the documents or tests referred to therein would guide the Court as well in making inquiry of such nature. In absence of any specific legislative mandate as regards the course a Court ought to undertake in an inquiry under Section 9(2) of the said Act, the prescription of the provisions of Section 94(2) provides a safe B guidance which the Court ought to follow. The result of such inquiry pronounced by the Court would be in the nature of a declaration on juvenility of a claimant-accused. 31. In the case of Rishipal Singh Solanki -vs- State of Uttar Pradesh and Others [(2022) 8 SCC 602], a two-Judge Bench of this C Court took this view, considering a large body of cases on this subject and observed: - “33. What emerges on a cumulative consideration of the aforesaid catena of s is as follows: 33.1. A claim of juvenility may be raised at any stage of a D criminal proceeding, even after a final disposal of the case. A delay in raising the claim of juvenility cannot be a ground for rejection of such claim. It can also be raised for the first time before this Court. 33.2. An application claiming juvenility could be made E either before the court or the JJ Board. 33.2.1. When the issue of juvenility arises before a court, it would be under sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 9 of the JJ Act, 2015 but when a person is brought before a committee or JJ Board, Section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 F applies. 33.2.2. If an application is filed before the court claiming juvenility, the provision of sub-section (2) of Section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 would have to be applied or read along with sub-section (2) of Section 9 so as to seek evidence G for the purpose of recording a finding stating the age of the person as nearly as may be. 33.2.3. When an application claiming juvenility is made under Section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 before the JJ Board when the matter regarding the alleged commission of H 1102 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A offence is pending before a court, then the procedure contemplated under Section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 would apply.
