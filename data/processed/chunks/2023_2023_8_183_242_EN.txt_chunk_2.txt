The Generators would be entitled to compensation on the restitutionary principle on such changes occurring after the cut-off date.

H 186 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 2. Insofar as increase in Busy Season Surcharge, Development Surcharge on transportation of coal, and Port Congestion Surcharge by the Indian Railways are concerned, the learned APTEL had found that the Indian Railways is an instrumentality of the State. It has been found that the Busy Season Surcharge, Development Surcharge and Port Congestion B Surcharge were increased from time to time vide Circulars/ Notifications issued by the Ministry of Railways, through the Railway Board. A Constitution Bench of this Court, in the case of Railway Board, Government of India v. M/s Observer Publications (P) Ltd., has held the Railway Board to be a State within the C meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. As such, no error could be found in the finding of the learned APTEL that the revision of charges to be paid on Busy Season Surcharge, Development Surcharge and Port Congestion Charges from time to time by the ‘Railway Board’ would come within the ambit of ‘Change in Law’. [Paras 101-103][220-C-E] D Railway Board, Government of India v. M/s Observer Publications (P) Ltd. (1972) 2 SCC 266 : [1972] 3 SCR 865 – relied on. 3. Insofar as MoEF notification on coal quality is concerned, E the MoEF, vide Notification dated 2nd January 2014, i.e. subsequent to the particular cut-off date, i.e. 1st June 2012, has mandated power projects to use beneficiated coal with ash content lower than 34%. The draft notification of MoEF dated 11th July 2012 culminated into the final Notification dated 2nd January 2014. By no stretch of imagination, can it be said that MoEF is not an F instrumentality of the State. By the said Notification, MoEF has mandated power projects to use beneficiated coal with ash content lower than 34%. Admittedly, prior to the cut-off date, the same was not a requirement. It is thus clear that the said Notifications dated 11th July 2012 and 2nd January 2014 would amount to G “Change in Law’. As such, no fault can be found with the finding of the learned APTEL that the same would amount to ‘Change in Law’. [Paras 104, 105][220-F-H; 221-A] 4. This Court in the case of Energy Watchdog so also in Adani Rajasthan case and recently in MSEDCL v. APML & Ors. H GMR WARORA ENERGY LTD. v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY 187 REGULATORY COMMISSION (CERC) has held that the change in NCDP would amount to ‘Change in A Law’. [Paras 106][221-C] 5. Insofar as Forest Tax is concerned, perusal of the material placed on record would reveal that, as on the cut-off date, there was no Forest Tax applicable on coal mined and transported from South Eastern Coalfields Limited (“SECL” for short) mines B located in Forest area.
