Nos. 6494, 6495, 6496, 6497 and 6498 of 2014 Appearances for Parties Ajit Bhasme, Sr. Adv., Byrapaneni Suyodhan, Ms. Nitipriya Kar, Bharat J Joshi, Kumar Shashank, Rupesh Kumar, Mukesh Kumar Pandey, Ms. Himani Bhatnagar, Sanjay Kumar Visen, Ms. Tatini Basu, Ms. Pankhuri Shrivastava, Atreya G.C., Advs. for the Appellant. Mrs. D. Bharathi Reddy, Guntur Prabhakar, Sahil Bhalaik, Tushar Giri, Siddharth Anil Khanna, Ms. Gulshan Jahan, Advs. for the Respondents. / of the Supreme Court Sudhanshu Dhulia, J. 1. Two questions arise in these appeals for our determination. The first question is whether “ghee” is a “product of livestock” under the provisions of The Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Markets Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) and the second would be whether the Government notification (G.O. Ms. No.286 dated 05.07.1994), which inter alia notifies “ghee” as one of the products of livestock for the purpose of regulation of purchase and sale of “ghee” in all notified market areas was published after due compliance of the procedure contemplated under the provisions of the Act? 2. In the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh, the above Act was brought with the purpose to consolidate and amend the laws regulating the purchase and sale of agricultural produce, livestock and products of livestock, along with establishment of markets in connection [2024] 3 S.C.R. 177 Sangam Milk Producer Company Ltd. v. The Agricultural Market Committee & Ors. therewith. The aim was to secure effective and remunerative price of commodities by bringing producers and traders face to face thereby eliminating middlemen and do away with some other earlier unethical trade practices, which were exploiting agriculturists and farmers. In other words, it was a farmer friendly legislation. The commodities which were to be regulated were not only agricultural produce but also livestock as well as products of livestock. Whereas livestock has been defined under Section 2(v) and products of livestock has been defined under Section 2(xv). Both the Sections are reproduced below: (v) ‘livestock’ means cows, buffaloes, bullocks, bulls, goats and sheep, and includes poultry, fish and such other animals as may be declared by the Government by notification to be livestock for the purposes of this Act; (xv) ‘products of livestock’ means such products of livestock as may be declared by the Government by notification, to be products of livestock for the purposes of this Act.
