[2023] 12 S.C.R. 150 : 2023 INSC 816 CASE DETAILS M/S. RPS INFRASTRUCTURE LTD. v. MUKUL KUMAR & ANR. (Civil Appeal No. 5590 of 2021) SEPTEMBER 11, 2023 [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL AND SUDHANSHU DHULIA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Whether the commercial entity’s claim pertaining to an arbitral award, in appeal u/s. 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is liable to be included at a belated stage-after the resolution plan approved by the Committee of Creditors and pending approval by the adjudicating authority. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process against the Corporate Debtor – Resolution plan approved by the Committee of Creditors-CoC and pending approval by the adjudicating authority – Inclusion of commercial entity’s claim pertaining to an arbitral award, in an appeal u/s. 37 after the delay of 287 days, if permissible: Held: It is diffi cult to release the undecided claims on the resolution applicant – Court is cautioned against allowing claims after the resolution plan has been accepted by the COC – Process followed by the resolution applicant not fl awed in any manner – Public announcement of the CIRP through newspapers would constitute deemed knowledge on the entity – Commercial entity ought to have been vigilant enough to fi nd out whether the Corporate Debtor was undergoing CIRP – Plea of not being aware of newspaper pronouncements could not be available to the entity – Mere fact that the Adjudicating Authority has yet not approved the plan does not imply that the plan can go back and forth, thereby making the CIRP an endless process – This would result in the reopening of the whole issue – Thus, NCLAT’s rejecting the claim of the entity, upheld – Arbitration 150 M/S.
