Radhey Shyam Yadav, Lal Chandra Kharwar and Ravindra Nath Yadav are the three appellants. On 25.06.1999, they were appointed as Assistant Teachers at the Junior High School, Bahorikpur, Maharajganj, District Jaunpur, U.P. (hereinafter referred to as ‘the School’). From October, 2005, abruptly their salaries were stopped. They moved the High Court for redressal. Both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench declined them relief. Aggrieved, they are before us in these Appeals. Brief facts:- 3. From the record, it appears that the School started as a recognized unaided school in 1983-1984 with one post of Head Master, four posts of Assistant Teacher, three posts of Peon and one post of Clerk. On 07.10.1996, two posts of Assistant Teacher were increased, raising the sanctioned strength of Assistant Teacher to six. 4. On 26.12.1997, the Director of Education (Basic) sanctioned certain additional posts of Assistant Teacher in the aforesaid School. While the department claims that by the of 26.12.1997, only two posts of Assistant Teacher were sanctioned, the Manager/Principal of the School claiming that three posts were sanctioned, went ahead and sought permission from the District Basic Education Officer for issuing advertisement. This was done by their letter of 28.01.1998. The letter of 26.12.1997 has been placed before us by the State in the form of an additional affidavit which indicates that only two posts were sanctioned. The State does not dispute that by the above letter two posts of Assistant Teacher were sanctioned. In 1998, the School became an aided School. 24 [2024] 1 S.C.R. DIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS 5. Thereafter, responding to the letter of the School, the District Basic Education Officer by his letter of 20.11.1998 accorded permission to issue advertisement for appointment of three posts of Assistant Teachers. On 25.11.1998, an advertisement was issued. The School, thereafter, on 08.12.1998, wrote a letter to the District Basic Education Officer to nominate a Member for the selection of the teachers.
