2 was not produced before the trial court. In the instant case, the High Court was therefore right in holding that when a document has been duly registered, there is a presumption of correctness and it can be rebutted only by strong evidence to the contrary. But the defendants have not led any evidence in to rebut the presumption as might be drawn F on the basis of the said endorsement on the body of the sale deed dated 03.09.1968 accepting original plaintiff no.2 as the attorney of the original owner. The same is a vital piece of evidence which has been ignored by the trial court as well as the first appellate court. The High Court is further right in holding that G original plaintiff no.2 was duly nominated and constituted as the attorney of original owner of the suit land and on the strength of the said power of attorney, plaintiff No.2 transferred land in favour of himself. As the absolute owner, plaintiff No.2 sold the said land to plaintiff No.1. Thus, plaintiff no.1 had every right to recover the said suit land, description of which has been provided in the H 148 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A Schedule (C) of the plaint by removing and demolishing all obstructions fromthe defendants. The High Court was therefore right in decreeing the suit.
