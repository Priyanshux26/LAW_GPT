6.1 It has been stated that the MoU dated 20th December, 2008 was executed to meet the urgent requirement of coal for BTPS. The purpose of incorporating Clause 12 was to keep a check on the rejects generated by GCWL during the washing of coal. The said clause specifically mentions that any disposal/sale of the rejects would be subject to compliances of the relevant rules and regulations. Learned counsel submitted that it is the case of the respondent-CBI itself that GCWL sold the rejects by mixing it with good coal at their washery. There is no document produced by the respondent-CBI to connect the rejects sold by GCWL to the appellants. The appellants cannot be roped in on the bald statements made by the functionaries of GCWL connecting them with the coal purchased in e-auction from WCL and sold off. 6.2 As for the Debit Note dated 21st March, 2009, it is submitted that the same was recovered from GCWL and not KECML. 72 [1978] 1 SCR 257 : (1977) 4 SCC 39 73 [2002] Supp. 2 SCR 350 : (2002) 8 SCC 87 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1211 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation The said Debit Note was neither acted upon nor approved by the Board of Directors of KECML and there is no supporting correspondence relating to the Debit Note to demonstrate any complicity on the part of the appellants. 6.3 The appellants have disputed the Certificate dated 12th July, 2010, purportedly issued by Mr. Avijit Sarkar to GCWL stating that the email was despatched by the said employee from his personal email id and not from the official email id of KECML and he was not authorized by the Board of Directors of KECML to issue any such email. Even otherwise, the Certificate runs contrary to Clause 12 of the MoU, as it purports to give 100% entitlement of the rejects to GCWL. 6.4 During the course of rejoining, arguments have also been advanced on the quantum of the rejects which as per the appellants, has been wrongly quantified by the respondent–CBI at 8,03,859.277 MT. Learned counsel contended that the said figure has been pulled out by the respondent-CBI from the CAG Report though it claims it has not relied on it to register the PE, followed by registration of the FIR. The attention of this Court has been drawn to the mismatch between the quantity of rejects for a period of two months (April and May of the year, 2012-13) claimed to be 207,837.117 MT by referring to a Certificate dated 07th June, 2016 issued by Mr. S.N. Roy, Statutory Auditor of KECML vis-à-vis the quantity of rejects generated for a period of twelve months for the previous year (2011-2012) that came to only 74,511.709 MT. Learned counsel submitted that in reply to the Audit query raised by the CAG, KECML had specifically stated that the total production of coal upto May, 2012 was 79,46,082.736 MT which included coal and rejects.
