74 SUPR[2E0M2E3] C1O0 USR.CT. RR.E 7P4O :R T20S23 INSC 5[827023] 10 S.C.R. A UGGARSAIN v. THE STATE OF HARYANA & ORS. (Criminal Appeal No(s). 1378-1379 of 2023) B JULY 03, 2023 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT AND DIPANKAR DATTA, JJ.] Sentence/Sentencing – Appropriateness of sentences – Eight accused persons were charged with and tried for offences punishable u/ss. 148, 149, 302, 304 Part-II and 323 of IPC for C having causing death of deceased and causing injury on others – Trial Court convicted all the accused persons and sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for life u/s. 302 r/w s.149 and one year rigorous imprisonment u/s. 148 and six months rigorous imprisonment u/s.323 r/w. s.149 – The High Court partially allowing the appeal D by the accused persons converted their conviction u/s. 302 r/w. s. 149 IPC to s.304 Part II r/w. s.149 IPC and affirmed convictions u/ s.148 and s.323 r/w. s.149 IPC – High Court observed that the case fell under Exception 4 to s.300 IPC – Appellants contended that impugned gravely erred in adopting the standard of sentence undergone, which resulted in widely different and disparate E results – On appeal, held: Appeals confined to the extent of appropriateness of sentences undergone by different accused persons for causing the same offence – All eight accused have undergone different periods under imprisonment varying from 9 years to 11 months – Principle of proportionality should guide the sentencing process – In the instant case, the sentencing was F inexplicable – No rationale appeared from the reasoning of the High Court for this wide disparity – The of High Court fell into error having not considered the gravity of the offence – Having held all the accused criminally liable, u/s. 304 Part II r/w s.149 IPC and also not having found any distinguishing feature in the form of separate roles played by each of them, the imposition of G the “sentence undergone” criteria, amounted to aberration, and the sentencing is for that reason, flawed – Considering totality of circumstances, appropriate sentence of five years rigorous imprisonment imposed – However, two accused (A-1 and A-6) having served more than that period, the impugned , as far as they are concerned is left undisturbed. H 74 UGGARSAIN v. THE STATE OF HARYANA & ORS. 75 Partly allowing the appeals, the Court A HELD: 1. The sentencing in this case, to put it mildly, is inexplicable (if not downright bizarre). On the one hand, A-1 underwent sentence for 9 years 4 months- at the other end of the spectrum, accused A-8 underwent only 11 months. No rationale appears from the reasoning of the High Court for this wide B disparity. It is not as though the court took note of the role ascribed to the accused (such a course was not possible, given the nature of the evidence). If it were assumed that the age of the accused played a role, then A-1, at 61 years- who served 9 years and A-6, who had served in the army, and was detained for over 8 years got the stiffest sentence.
