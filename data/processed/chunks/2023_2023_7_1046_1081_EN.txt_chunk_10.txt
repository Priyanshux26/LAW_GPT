OF N.C.T. OF DELHI THR. ITS PRINCIPAL SECRETARY (FINANCE) [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] “intention was to withdraw the exemption and make the sale leviable A to tax at the rate prescribed in the later notification”. The court also held it to be unnecessary that “a specific or separate notification withdrawing or revoking the notification should be issued”. 18. The Delhi High Court, after examination of the s cited held that it was difficult to depart from the reasoning indicated by B the various s of this court indicated in Agra Belting Works (supra). It therefore, rejected the appellants’ writ petition. 19. It was further held in the impugned s that State Legislatures were competent to levy taxes on the sale or purchase of the commodities subjected to additional excise duty. The levy of any C sales taxes only meant that additional excise duty levied on such commodities by the Central Government would not be distributed among the states which had chosen to levy a tax on the sale of such article. The court relied on Mahalakshmi Oil Mills v. State of Andhra Pradesh15. The High Court ruled that pan masala containing tobacco is, under Chapter D 24, shown at sub-heading No.2404.49, attracting a duty of 16% and an additional duty of 18% on the same. Pan masala containing tobacco manufactured by the appellants did not constitute a declared commodity under Section 14(ix) of the CST Act read with the CET Act because sub-heading 2404.49 under Chapter 24 of the CET Act are not sub- headings included in section 14(ix) of the CST Act. It was also held that E pan masala was not a declared item nor was it a declared item on the date that Section 14(ix) of the CST Act was introduced in the form in which it existed in the statute.
