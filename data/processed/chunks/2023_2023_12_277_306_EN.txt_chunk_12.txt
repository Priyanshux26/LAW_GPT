423 (E) dated 12.02.2015 received prior to giving eff ect to the Concession Rules, 20169, irrespective of its duration of pendency shall become ineligible. In other words, these applications are not to be considered. The proviso makes an exception and states that if an applicant, who had made an application prior to 29.07.2016, had been issued a Grant or a Letter of Intent, or any other requiring alteration of the applicant’s position, his application for mining lease may be considered after due compliance of all necessary conditions. The question is whether the respondents’ case is covered by the exception in terms of the proviso to Rule 61 of the Concession Rules,2016. We have already referred to the reasoning given by the division bench of the High Court dealing with the Concession Rules, 2016, and would like to quote the fi ndings which hold that the proviso would not be applicable to the facts of the present case. These observations read: “25. ….Neither such recent policy nor can the provisions of the West Bengal Minor Minerals Concession Rules, 2016 can apply to the application of the writ petitioners made in March, 1998 and more so as the of the Joint Secretary to grant lease is dated 13th October, 9 The Concession Rules, 2016 came into eff ect on 29.07.2016 STATE OF WEST BENGAL v. M/S. CHIRANJILAL (MINERAL) 293 INDUSTRIES OF BAGANDIH [SANJIV KHANNA, J.] 2006 and that of this Court directing grant of long term lease is dated 10th September, 2014 are prior to such policy and prior to the said Rules came into operation. It further appears that necessary mining plan taking into account the environmental aspect has been submitted by the writ petitioners and the appellant/State has raised no grievance in respect thereof.” 7. The policy referred to in the aforesaid paragraph is in terms of the letter dated 02.02.2018 issued by the Principal Secretary, State of West Bengal, wherein it is specifi ed that obtaining a Conversion Certifi cate is a mandatory condition for the purpose of a mining lease. Reference in the impugned to the dated 13.10.2006, or for that matter, the Letter of Intent dated 26.10.2006 is inconsequential as the said s were recalled and revoked on 03.12.2010. The s did not survive and continue to operate thereafter. Writ Petition No. 7505 (W) of 2003 was disposed of ex-parte, without noticing that the dated 13.10.2006 had been recalled or cancelled, albeit the had directed that the application for grant of lease would be considered in accordance with law and the rules applicable at the time of consideration. The dated 03.12.2010 was never challenged by the Respondent No. 1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih and has attained fi nality. At best, the case of the Respondent No. 1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih is that the application dated 06.03.1998 should be considered in accordance with law. 8. The Respondent No. 1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih has relied upon of this Court in Bhushan Power and Steel Limited v. S.L.
