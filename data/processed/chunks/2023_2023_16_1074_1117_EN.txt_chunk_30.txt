This is a matter which must engage the attention of the Union Government. The manner in which this exercise would have to be determined within the purview of the Delimitation Act 2002. But as we have already noted earlier, the exercise would require legislative amendments, particularly having regard to the provisions of the PUBLIC INTEREST COMMITTEE FOR SCHEDULING SPECIFIC 1117 AREAS v. UOI [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] First and Second Schedules to the RP Act. Directing a legislative amendment is beyond the domain of judicial review. 106. In regard to the State of West Bengal, it has been submitted, by the counsel appearing on behalf of the Election Commission that broadly an additional seat would have to be made available in the State of West Bengal for the Scheduled Tribes in to accommodate the principle of proportional representation. The above submission makes it abundantly clear that it is for the Union Government to take recourse to the powers under the Delimitation Act 2002 for the purpose of ensuring that the provisions of Articles 330 and 332 are duly implemented. The Central Government should take a decision with all reasonable dispatch, in accordance with law. 107. We, however, clarify that this shall not be construed as interfering with the election schedule that the Election Commission may prescribe for the conduct of elections either to Parliament or to the State Legislative Assemblies. 108. The Writ Petitions are disposed of in view of the above discussion. 109. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Writ petitions disposed. Nidhi Jain
