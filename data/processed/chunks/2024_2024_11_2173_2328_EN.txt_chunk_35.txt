(2) If a controversy remains concerning any of the grounds referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1), a party may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, apply to the Court to decide on the termination of the mandate. (3) If, under this section or sub-section of (3) of section 13, an arbitrator withdraws from his office or a party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, it shall not imply acceptance of the validity of any ground referred to in this section or sub-section (3) of section 12”] 83 Bharat Broadband Network Ltd. v. United Telecoms Ltd. (2019) 5 SCC 755 [17] [“17. The scheme of Sections 12, 13 and 14, therefore, is that where an arbitrator makes a disclosure in writing which is likely to give justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality, the appointment of such arbitrator may be challenged under Sections 12(1) to 12(4) read with Section 13. However, where such person becomes “ineligible” to be appointed as an arbitrator, there is no question of challenge to such arbitrator, before such arbitrator. In such a case i.e. a case which falls under Section 12(5), Section 14(1)(a) of the Act 2220 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 49. The disclosure requirement helps prevent the appointment of an unacceptable candidate.84 The duty of disclosure is a continuing requirement to: (i) provide the information to any party who did not obtain it before the arbitrator’s appointment; and (ii) secure information about circumstances that only arise at a later stage of the arbitral proceedings, that is, new business affiliations or share acquisitions.85 50. During the drafting of Article 12 of the Model Law, proposals were mooted to provide specific circumstances or grounds for challenging the appointment of arbitrators. The Secretariat noted that instead of prescribing a list of all the possible grounds of challenge, an alternative would be to prescribe “a general formula such as “circumstances giving rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator’s impartiality or independence.””86 The Working Group did not set forth any comprehensive understanding of the meaning of the standard for challenge included under Article 12.87 It acknowledged that the general formula is exhaustive and will include most of the grounds of challenge set forth under national laws.88 According to the Working Group, the grounds of challenge under national law applicable to judges, such as a financial interest or previous involvement in the subject matter or a certain relation to one of the parties, could apply to arbitrators.89 51. Section 13 prescribes the procedure for challenging an arbitrator in terms of Section 12(3).90 Section 13(1) provides that the parties are gets attracted inasmuch as the arbitrator becomes, as a matter of law (i.e. de jure), unable to perform his functions under Section 12(5), being ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. This being so, his mandate automatically terminates, and he shall then be substituted by another arbitrator under Section 14(1) itself.”] 84 A/CN.9/264, page 30 85 Ibid. 86 Report of the Secretary-General: possible features of a model law on international commercial arbitration, A/CN.9/207, [65].
