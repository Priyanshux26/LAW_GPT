Whether an issue is concluded or not is also a court’s D domain.” 12. If they feel no action was taken after the alleged occurrence and the matter was compromised as projected by the prosecution, there would have been other independent witnesses as well. The prosecution has not produced any such witness. The Courts below have not considered E the evidence available on record in the proper perspective.

In fact, the First Information Report itself speaks about the aforesaid fact. 13. In view of the foregoing discussion, we have no hesitation in F holding that the conviction and sentence rendered by the Additional Sessions Judge (Adhoc), Fast Track Court, Amritsar in Sessions Case No. 41 of 2002 as confirmed in Criminal Appeal No. S.1106 SB of 2003 of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana require to be set aside.
