60. Recently, a three-Judges Bench of this Court in the case of Rajeev Suri v. Delhi Development Authority and Others25, after considering the earlier s, held that the change of use of government land which is of general nature would be a function which has a quasi-legislative hue to it. 61. It can thus be seen that it is a settled position of law that the exercise of power for the preparation, finalization and approval of development plan is a power exercised by the delegatee for enacting a subordinate piece of legislation. We therefore have no manner of doubt in holding that the aforesaid provisions as contained in the TCP Act provide for exercise of power by a delegatee to enact a piece of subordinate legislation. C. Whether the NGT could have issued directions to the legislative body to exercise its legislative functions in a particular manner? 62. A perusal of the first of NGT would reveal that the NGT, in effect, has issued directions to the authority empowered to enact the development plan, to do so in a particular manner. The question therefore that will have to be considered is as to whether the NGT could have exercised its jurisdiction in such a manner, to issue such directions. 24 [2012] 4 SCR 881 : (2012) 3 SCC 442 : 2012 INSC 50 25 [2021] 15 SCR 283 : (2022) 11 SCC 1: 2021 INSC 4 1008 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 63. In the case of V.K. Naswa v. Home Secretary, Union of India and Others26, the petitioner-in-person had approached this Court to issue directions to the Central Government, through the Ministry of Law & Justice, to amend the law for taking action against a person for showing any kind of disrespect to the national flag or for not observing the terms contained in the Flag Code of India, 2002. In the alternative, it was prayed by the petitioner-in-person that this Court may be pleased to issue direction(s) in that regard. 64. This Court, in the said case, after surveying various earlier s on the issue, observed thus: “6. It is a settled legal proposition that the court can neither legislate nor issue a direction to the legislature to enact in a particular manner. 7. In Mallikarjuna Rao v. State of A.P. [(1990) 2 SCC 707 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 387 : (1990) 13 ATC 724 : AIR 1990 SC 1251] and V.K. Sood v. Deptt. of Civil Aviation [1993 Supp (3) SCC 9 : 1993 SCC (L&S) 907 : (1993) 25 ATC 68 : AIR 1993 SC 2285], this Court has held that the writ court, in exercise of its power under Article 226, has no power even indirectly to require the executive to exercise its law-making power. The Court observed that it is neither legal nor proper for the High Court to issue directions or advisory sermons to the executive in respect of the sphere which is exclusively within the domain of the executive under the Constitution.
