G The basis for providing reservation for PWD is physical disability and not any of the criteria forbidden under Article 16(1). Therefore, the rule of no reservation in promotions as laid down in Indra Sawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of 9Rajeev Kumar Gupta v. Union of India, (2016) 13 SCC 153 H 818 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] has clearly and normatively no application to PWD. (emphasis supplied) ***************** B 24. A combined reading of Sections 32 and 33 of the 1995 Act explicates a fine and designed balance between requirements of administration and the imperative to provide greater opportunities to PWD. Therefore, as detailed in the first part of our analysis, the identification exercise under C Section 32 is crucial. Once a post is identified, it means that a PWD is fully capable of discharging the functions associated with the identified post. Once found to be so capable, reservation under Section 33 to an extent of not less than three per cent must follow. Once the post is identified, it must be reserved for PWD irrespective of the mode of recruitment D adopted by the State for filling up of the said post.” 8. A reference was then made to a larger bench to resolve the issue with respect to interpretation of reservations in promotions as settled by Indra Sawhney (supra) and Rajeev Kumar Gupta (supra). Thus, in Siddaraju v. State of Karnataka10, a three-judge bench decision E rendered by Nariman, J. held: “12. After hearing the learned counsel appearing on behalf of all the parties including the learned Additional Solicitor General, we are of the view that the of this Court cannot be faulted when it stated that Indra Sawhney [Indra F Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 215 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 482] dealt with a different problem and, therefore, cannot be followed.” 9. Thereafter, in State of Kerala v. Leesamma Joseph11, a two- judge bench authored by Kaul, J. held in unequivocal terms G that reservations in promotions could not be denied to persons with disabilities: 10Siddaraju v. State of Karnataka, (2020) 19 SCC 572. H 11State of Kerala v. Leesamma Joseph, (2021) 9 SCC 208. RESERVE BANK OF INDIA & ORS. v. A.K. NAIR & ORS. 819 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] “18. On examination of the aforesaid plea we find that there A is merit in what the learned Amicus Curiae contends and we are of the view that really this issue is no more res integra in view of the s of this Court in Union of India v. Ravi Prakash Gupta [Union of India v. Ravi Prakash Gupta, (2010) 7 SCC 626 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 448] and Union of B India v. National Federation of the Blind [Union of India v. National Federation of the Blind, (2013) 10 SCC 772 : (2014) 2 SCC (L&S) 257] opining that reservation has to be computed with reference to the total number of vacancies in the cadre strength and no distinction can be made between the posts to be filled by direct recruitment and by promotion.
