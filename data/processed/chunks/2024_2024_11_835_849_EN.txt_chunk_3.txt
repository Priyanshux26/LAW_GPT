6.2 On the aspect of loss of future income, it was held that the claimant-appellant, since he was below the age of 40, was entitled to 40% under this head. The amount was calculated to be Rs.70,22,520/-. In conclusion, considering other heads as well, the amount of compensation arrived at was a total of Rs.78,16,390/- as opposed to Rs.58,09,930/- awarded by the Tribunal. 6.3 The Insurance Company was directed to deposit the amount within four weeks, excluding interest, for the compensation awarded under the heading future medical expenses. The interest rate was maintained at 6%. 7. Further, aggrieved by the final and of the High Court, the claimant-appellant is before us. 8. During the course of arguments, it was submitted by the learned counsel for the claimant-appellant, that :- (i) The High Court erred in taking future prospects at @ 40% instead of 50% in accordance with National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi;4 (ii) Under the head ‘pain and suffering’, the compensation awarded by the High Court is insufficient given the 100% functional disability. In arguing that the compensation should be increased to Rs.10,00,000/-, reliance is placed on a of this Court in Benson George v. Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. & Anr.,5 and, in particular, para 20 thereof, wherein it was held 4 [2017] 13 SCR 100 : (2017) 16 SCC 680 5 [2022] 1 SCR 653 : (2022) 13 SCC 142 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 841 K.S. Muralidhar v. R. Subbulakshmi & Anr. that in the attending facts and circumstances, considering the multiple brain injuries/injuries sustained by the claimant because of which he was comatose and bedridden, Rs.10,00,000/- was awarded as enhanced compensation, observing the same to be reasonable; (iii) The Tribunal awarded Rs.1,00,000/- in terms of future medical expenses, which the High Court maintained without any discussion. Under this head too, it was submitted that the compensation should be enhanced to Rs.10,00,000/- in view of Parminder Singh v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd;6 and Lalan D. v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd.7. 9. The age of the claimant-appellant at the time of the accident was 37 years.8 The computation of future prospects is to be done as per the law laid down by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Pranay Sethi (supra) para 59.3, which records the conclusion in this regard, reads as under :- “59.3 While determining income, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the income of the deceased towards future prospects, where the deceased had a permanent job and was below the age of 40 years should be made. The addition should be 30%, if the age of the deceased was between 40 to 50 years. In case the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years, the addition should be 15%. Actual salary should read as actual salary less tax.” 10. It is submitted that the claimant-appellant’s employment was permanent in nature, and as such, the loss of future income ought to be calculated, in terms of the above, at 50%.
