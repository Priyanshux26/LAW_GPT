[Paras 11, 12.3.1, 12.3.3, 12.4.1, 16-18] Doctrine – Common law doctrine – Rule of tort – Eggshell skull rule – Application of the rule – Jurisprudence: Held: Jurisprudence of the application of this rule, as developed (in countries other than India) has fit into four categories – First, when a latent condition of the plaintiff has been unearthed – Second, when the negligence on the part of the wrongdoer re-activates a plaintiff’s pre-existing condition that had subsided due to treatment – Third, wrongdoer’s actions aggravate known, pre-existing conditions, that have not yet received medical attention – Fourth, when the wrongdoer’s actions accelerate an inevitable disability or loss of life due to a condition possessed by the plaintiff, even when the eventuality would have occurred with time, in the absence of the wrongdoer’s actions – The persons to whose cases this rule can be applied, are persons who have pre-existing conditions– Therefore, for this rule to be appropriately invoked and applied, the person in whose case an adjudicatory authority applies must have a pre-existing condition falling into either of the four categories. [Para 12.4.3] Compensation – Just compensation: Held: The idea of compensation is based on restitutio in integrum, which means, make good the loss suffered, so far as money is able to do so, or, in other words, take the receiver of such compensation, [2024] 4 S.C.R. 759 Jyoti Devi v.
