The intent behind preferring arbitration would stand defeated, if the Court is expected to deal not only with the issue of existence but also validity of the agreement, at the G stage of appointment of the arbitrator. In this context, the following observations were made in the 246th LCI report (supra) noted: 81 George A. Bermann, The Role of National Courts at the Threshold of Arbitration, 28 American Review of International Arbitration 291 (2017) Available at https:// scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/3012 H 486 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A “22. Judicial intervention in arbitration proceedings adds significantly to the delays in the arbitration process and ultimately negates the benefits of arbitration. Two reasons can be attributed to such delays. First, the judicial system is over-burdened with work and is not sufficiently efficient to dispose cases, especially commercial cases, with the speed and dispatch that is required. Second, the B bar for judicial intervention (despite the existence of section 5 of the Act) has been consistently set at a low threshold by the Indian judiciary, which translates into many more admissions of cases in Court which arise out of or are related to the Act.” C [emphasis supplied] 85.6.Considering the large pendency of cases as noted by the 246th LCI Report(supra), it is essential that Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 is given full play. Discussing the history of arbitration law in India, the 246th LCI Report(supra) quoted the observations of Justice D D.A. Desai in Guru Nanak Foundation v Ratan Singh and Sons82 where commenting on the working of the Arbitration Act, 1940, it was noted that the challenge to arbitral proceedings in Courts have made “lawyers laugh and legal philosophers weep”. The situation is not different today as was recently observed by this Court in M/s Shree Vishnu E Constructions v. The Engineer in Chief Military Engineering Service and others83where it was noted that several applications under section 11 were decided and disposed of after a period of four years which defeated the very purpose of the amended Arbitration Act, 1996. Such observation was made on a detailed report/statement on the number of pending section 11 applications before the Telangana High Court. This F Court noticed that even an application filed in the year 2006 was still pending. The High Court Chief Justices across the country were accordingly requested to ensure that applications under section 11, be decided within a period of six months. 85.7 This Court in the recent in Intercontinental Hotels G Group (India) Private Ltd. v. Waterline Hotels Pvt. Ltd84 on the issue of insufficiently /incorrectly stamped documents, proceeded to appoint the arbitrator under Section 11(6), considering the time- 82 (1981) 4 SCC 634 83 SLP(C) No. 5306/2022 dated 1.4.2022 H 84 2022 SCC OnLine SC 83 M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 487 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] sensitivity while dealing with arbitration. It left open the issue of A stamping to be decided at a later stage. 85.8 Importantly, Section 11(13) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 provides that appointment of Arbitrators should be made within 60 days and such a provision makes it amply clear that substantive adjudication cannot be done by Courts, at the pre-referral stage.
