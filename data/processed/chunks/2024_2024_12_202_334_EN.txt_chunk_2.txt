[Paras 90-94] Customs Act, 1962 – ss.17 and 28 – Assessment of duty – Notice for payment of duties, interest – Scheme of ss.17 and 28: Held: s.17 read with ss.46 and 47 deals with the assessment and re-assessment at the first instance that is, upon entry of the consignments and clearance of bills of entry – Amendment to s.17 introduces the process of self-assessment and subsequent re-assessment upon verification by the proper officer, if so required, for undertaking a check at the first instance – Proceedings u/s.28 are subsequent to the completion of the process set out in s.17 – Procedure envisaged u/s.28 is in the nature of a quasi-judicial proceeding with the issuance of the show cause notice by the proper officer followed by adjudication of such notices by the field customs officers – In the case of DRI, the proceedings u/s.28 start only after an investigation has been undertaken by DRI – This is reaffirmed by Circular No. 4/99-Cus dated 15.02.1999 and Circular No. 44/2011-Customs dated 23.11.2011 – Thus, the nature of review u/s.28 significantly different from the nature of assessment and reassessment u/s.17 – Ambit of s.28 has also been restricted to the review of assessments and re-assessments done u/s.17 for ascertaining if there has been a short-levy, non-levy, part payment, non-payment or erroneous refund – Scheme of ss.17 and 28 indicates that there cannot be a mandatory condition linking the two provisions and the interpretation of this Court in the Sayed Ali’s case and Canon India’s case that vesting of the functions of assessment and re-assessment u/s.17 is a threshold, mandatory 206 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports condition for proper officer to perform functions u/s.28, patently erroneous. [Paras 95-99] Customs Act, 1962 – s.28 – Notice for payment of duties, interest – Use of article ‘the’ in the expression “the proper officer” – Interpretation: Held: In Canon India’s case it was held that the Parliament had employed the article “the” instead of “a/an” in s.28 so as to give effect to its intention of specifying that the proper officer referred to in s.28 is the same officer as the one referred to in s.17 and the use of a definite article instead of an indefinite article is indicative of the fact that the proper officer referred to in s.28 is not “any” proper officer but “the” proper officer assigned with the function of assessment and reassessment u/s.17 – There was an error apparent in the said view – Definite article “the” has been used before “proper officer” with a view to limit the exercise of powers u/s.28 by a specific proper officer and not any proper officer – However, in the absence of any statutory linkage between ss.17 and 28 respectively, there was no legal footing for this Court in Canon India’s case to hold that “the proper officer” in s.28 must necessarily be the same proper officer referred to u/s.17 – Statutory scheme of the 1962 Act necessitates that an officer of Customs can only perform the functions u/s.28 if such officer has been designated as “the proper officer” for the purposes of s.28 by an appropriate notification – Use of the article “the” in the expression “the proper officer” should be read in the context of that proper officer who has been conferred with the powers of discharging the functions u/s.28 by conferment u/s.5 – Proper officer is qua the function or power to be discharged or exercised – Use of article “the” in s.28 has no apparent relation with the proper officer referred to u/s.17.
