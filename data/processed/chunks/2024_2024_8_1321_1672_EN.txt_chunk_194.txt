The State Government can decide the manner and quantum of reservation. As such, the State can also make sub-classification when providing reservation to all Scheduled Castes in the List based on the rationale that would conform with the very spirit of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution providing reservation. The State Government cannot tamper with the List; it can neither include nor exclude any caste in the List or make enquiry whether any synonym exists as held in Milind [State of Maharashtra v. Milind, (2001) 1 SCC 4 : 2001 SCC (L&S) 117] . 57. The interpretation of Articles 14, 15, 16, 338, 341, 342 and 342-A is a matter of immense public importance, and correct interpretation of binding precedents in Indra Sawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1] and other decisions. Though we have full respect for the principle of stare decisis, at the same time, the Court cannot be a silent spectator and shut eyes to stark realities. The constitutional [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1593 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. goal of social transformation cannot be achieved without taking into account changing social realities. 58. We endorse the opinion of a Bench of 3 Judges that E.V. Chinnaiah [E.V. Chinnaiah v. State of A.P., (2005) 1 SCC 394 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 329] is required to be revisited by a larger Bench; more so, in view of further development and the amendment of the Constitution, which have taken place. We cannot revisit E.V. Chinnaiah [E.V. Chinnaiah v. State of A.P., (2005) 1 SCC 394 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 329] being Bench of coordinate strength. We request the Hon’ble Chief Justice to place the matters before a Bench comprising of 7 Judges or more as considered appropriate.” 14. In view of the above, the matters have been placed before us for consideration whether the E.V. Chinnaiah requires revisitation or not. In other words, for consideration as to whether the law laid down by E.V. Chinnaiah is the correct law in the light of certain observations made in Indra Sawhney. RELEVANT CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS 15. In to appreciate the rival contentions raised in the instant Reference, it would be beneficial to reproduce the relevant provisions of the Constitution for ready reference. “Article 14.
