Such right was not available after the purchase in 2000 and no such right has been provided to the purchasers G under the 2013 Act also. Granting a right to question acquisition would be against the public policy and the law which prohibits such transactions; it cannot be given effect to under the guise of subsequent legislation containing similar provisions. Subsequent legislation does not confer any new right to a person based on such void transaction; instead, it H GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI v. RAVINDER KUMAR 319 JAIN & ORS. [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] includes a provision prohibiting such transactions without A permission of the Collector as provided in Section 11(4). 27. Thus, we have to follow the decisions including that of larger Bench mentioned above, laying down the law on the subject, which still holds the field and were wrongly distinguished. The binding value of the decisions of larger B and coordinate Benches have been ignored while deciding Manav Dharam Trust case [State (NCT of Delhi) v. Manav Dharam Trust, (2017) 6 SCC 751 : (2017) 3 SCC (Civ) 611] , it was not open to it to take a different view. The decision in Manav Dharam Trust [State (NCT of Delhi) v. Manav Dharam C Trust, (2017) 6 SCC 751 : (2017) 3 SCC (Civ) 611] is per incuriam in light of this decision of this Court in Mamleshwar Prasad v. Kanhaiya Lal [Mamleshwar Prasad v. Kanhaiya Lal, (1975) 2 SCC 232] , A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak [A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak, (1988) 2 SCC 602 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 372] , State of U.P. v. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. [State of D U.P. v. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd., (1991) 4 SCC 139] , B. Shama Rao v. State (UT of Pondicherry) [B. Shama Rao v. State (UT of Pondicherry), AIR 1967 SC 1480] , MCD v. Gurnam Kaur [MCD v. Gurnam Kaur, (1989) 1 SCC 101] , State of M.P. v. Narmada Bachao Andolan [State of M.P. v. E Narmada Bachao Andolan, (2011) 7 SCC 639 : (2011) 3 SCC (Civ) 875 : AIR 2011 SC 1989] , Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. v. State of Orissa [Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. v. State of Orissa, (2015) 2 SCC 189 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 38] and Sant Lal Gupta v. Modern Coop. Group Housing Society Ltd. [Sant Lal Gupta v. Modern Coop. Group Housing Society Ltd., F (2010) 13 SCC 336 : (2010) 4 SCC (Civ) 904] 28. We hold that Division Bench in Manav Dharam Trust [State (NCT of Delhi) v. Manav Dharam Trust, (2017) 6 SCC 751 : (2017) 3 SCC (Civ) 611] does not lay down the law correctly. Given the several binding precedents which are available and G the provisions of the 2013 Act, we cannot follow the decision in Manav Dharam Trust [State (NCT of Delhi) v. Manav Dharam Trust, (2017) 6 SCC 751 : (2017) 3 SCC (Civ) 611] and overrule it. Shri S.N. Bhatt, learned counsel submitted that in case this Court does not agree with the Manav Dharam H 320 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R.
