(1) SCC 684, (“Deepak Theatre”). Reliance was further placed by the respondents on T. Velayudhan Achari vs. Union of India, (1993) 2 SCC 582, (“T. Velayudhan Achari”), wherein it was held that limiting the number of depositors that can be accepted by an individual, firm or unincorporated associations under Section 45S(1) of the Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 1983 is not violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, as it is in public interest that larger interests of the depositors are protected. 5.13 The of Delhi High Court in Shri R. Nanabhoy, was sought to be distinguished from the present case by citing the presence of both legislative sanction and expert opinion, vide CBDT Letter dated 19.01.1988 and CAG Report No.32 of 2014, supporting the utility of the measure in achieving the objects sought, namely, quality and accuracy in such audits. 5.14 Therefore, it was prayed by the respondent-Institute that all the writ petitions/transferred cases filed before various High Courts and this Court challenging the validity of Chapter VI of the Council Guidelines No.1-CA(7)/02/2008 dated 08.08.2008 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 819 Shaji Poulose v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India & Others issued by the respondent-Institute be held to be devoid of any merits and thereby dismissed. Points for Consideration: 6. Having heard learned senior counsel and learned counsel appearing for the respective parties and upon perusal of the record, the following points would arise for our consideration: (i) Whether the Council of the respondent-Institute, under the 1949 Act, was competent to impose, by way of Guidelines, a numerical restriction on the maximum number of tax audits that could be accepted by a Chartered Accountant, under Section 44AB of the IT Act, 1961, in a Financial Year by way of a Guideline? (ii) Whether the restrictions imposed are unreasonable and therefore, violative of the right guaranteed to Chartered Accountants under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution? (iii) Whether the restrictions imposed are arbitrary and illegal and therefore, impermissible under Article 14 of the Constitution? (iv) Whether exceeding such specified number of tax audits can be deemed to be ‘professional misconduct’? (v) What ? Legal Framework: 7. At this stage, the relevant provisions of the 1949 Act must be perused. The Government of India framed the Auditors Certificate Rules in 1932 in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 144 of the Indian Companies Act, 1913. While the accountancy profession in India was regulated under those Rules, in to have a permanent regulation of accountancy profession, it was found necessary to have a body to secure and maintain all the requisite standards of professional qualifications, discipline and conduct of the accountancy. 7.1 In the above context, of particular relevance is the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 1949 Act (see Gazette of India, 11-09-1948, Pt. V, p. 709), which is reproduced hereunder:- “STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 1.
