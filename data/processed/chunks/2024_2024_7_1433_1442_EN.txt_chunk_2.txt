The calculation of the total loss of dependency is as under: Rs.6,08,904 x 17 multiplier = Rs.1,03,51,368/-. The petitioner is entitled for loss of dependency Rs.1,03,51,368/- . Therefore, the petitioner is entitled for total compensation under different heads as follows: 1. Loss of Love and Affection ₹ 25,000-00 2. Funeral Expenses ₹ 25,000-00 3. Loss of Dependency ₹ 1,03,51,368-00 Total Compensation Rounded ₹ 1,04,01,368-00 off ₹ 1,04,01,000-00 Therefore, the petitioner is entitled for total compensation of Rs.1,04,01,000/- along with interest @ 6% per annum from the date of petition till its realization.” 4. The High Court, while considering the appeal preferred by respondent No. 1- Insurance Company, concluded that the Accident Claims Tribunal’s approach while assessing the compensation under the head of ‘loss of dependency’ was erroneous on various grounds. It was held that the salary of the deceased, should be based on the Annual Salary Review for the year 2013, according to which his gross salary was ₹ 4,88,982/- (Rupees four lakh eighty eight thousand nine hundred and eighty two only). This figure realistically [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1437 Meenakshi v. The Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. reflects what the deceased-Suryakanth would have received for the year 2013. The High Court took the basic salary of deceased- Suryakanth @ ₹ 2,30,652/- (Rupees two lakh thirty thousand six hundred and fifty two only) per annum for calculating the loss of income and only on the said figure, the future prospects @50% were applied, which worked out to ₹ 1,15,326/- (Rupees one lakh fifteen thousand three hundred and twenty six only). As per the High Court, the total loss of income, including the allowances worked out to ₹ 6,20,967/- (Rupees six lakh twenty thousand nine hundred and sixty seven only). From the said amount professional tax to the tune of ₹ 2,400/- (Rupees two thousand four hundred only) and Income Tax to the tune of @ ₹ 61,857/- (Rupees sixty one thousand eighty hundred and fifty seven only) was deducted and hence, the total annual income of the deceased-Suryakanth worked out to ₹ 5,56,710/- (Rupees five lakh fifty six thousand seven hundred and ten only) as per the High Court. The High Court in particular held that the components of house rent allowance, flexible benefit plan and contribution to provident fund etc. could not be accounted for the purpose of adding 50% to the gross income of the deceased on the principle of future prospects. 5. Multiplier of 17 was applied to the said figure and 50% from the total income calculated as above was deducted towards personal expenses considering the fact that the claimant, i.e., the appellant herein, being the mother of the deceased, was the sole dependent of the deceased. The net re-assessed compensation as calculated by the High Court came out to ₹ 49,57,035/- (Rupees forty nine lakh fifty seven thousand and thirty five only). Consequently, the compensation awarded by the Accident Claims Tribunal was reduced as above vide the impugned dated 2nd August, 2017 which is subjected to challenge by the claimant-appellant by way of this appeal by special leave.
