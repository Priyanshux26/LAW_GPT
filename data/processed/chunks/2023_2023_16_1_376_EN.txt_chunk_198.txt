In exercise of the power under Article 3, Parliament has enacted legislations which reorganised the constituent units of the country at various points in time. It has altered the names of Karnataka (previously Mysore), Tamil Nadu (previously Madras), Uttarakhand (previously Uttaranchal) and Odisha (previously Orissa).349 The erstwhile State of Bombay was divided into Gujarat and Maharashtra.350 The State of Nagaland was carved out from the State of Assam.351 The State of Meghalaya was established,352 which was previously an autonomous state within the State of Assam.353 The State of Haryana was carved out of the State of Punjab.354 The State of Chhattisgarh was carved out of the State of Madhya Pradesh.355 Sikkim was admitted into the Union of India in 1975 and was granted the status of a full State.356 Uttarakhand (previously Uttaranchal) was carved out of the State of Uttar Pradesh.357 Similarly, Jharkhand was carved out of the State of Bihar.358 Most recently, the State of Telangana was carved out of the State of Andhra Pradesh.359 499. It is evident from these examples that Parliament admitted and established new States in India. In the process, some States such as the State of Bombay appear to be “extinguished” (so to speak). Some may argue that 348 Article 3, Constitution of India 349 Mysore State (Alteration of Name) Act 1973, Madras State (Alteration of Name) Act 1973, Uttaranchal (Alteration of Name) Act 2006, Orissa (Alteration of Name) Act 2011. 350 Bombay Reorganisation Act 1960 351 State of Nagaland Act 1962 352 North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act 1971 353 Assam Reorganisation (Meghalaya) Act 1969 354 Punjab Reorganisation Act 1966 355 Madhya Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2000 356 Constitution (Thirty-sixth Amendment) Act 1975 357 Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2000 358 Bihar Reorganisation Act 2000 359 Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2014 284 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. the alteration of names of the States similarly “extinguishes” the older State. However, the diff erence between extinguishing a State and extinguishing the character of a constituent unit as a State is of great consequence. A particular State may cease to exist because it is divided to create two (or more) new States. Similarly, a particular State may cease to exist because it is divided to create a State (or more than one State) and a Union territory (or more than one Union territory). In both cases, the alteration of the area (or at least some part of the area) does not result in it losing its character as a State, with the attendant constitutional implications. A constituent unit can be said to lose its character as a State only if it is converted into a Union territory in full, with no part of it retaining statehood. A change in the boundaries or the name of a State does not result in the change of its character as a State because such a character is derived not from its name or boundaries but from its relationship with the Union Government – one characterised by autonomy. As discussed in the previous segment, the Constitution confers legislative and executive powers on the States, which play an indispensable role in our democratic set-up.
