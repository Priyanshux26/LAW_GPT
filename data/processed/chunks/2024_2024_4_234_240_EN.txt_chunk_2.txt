His second submission is that though other independent eyewitnesses were available, the prosecution had chosen to examine only the witnesses closely related to the deceased who were interested and tutored witnesses. Therefore, their testimony deserves to be discarded. Without prejudice, his further submission is that it was the deceased who went to the house of accused no.1 to enquire about the failure of accused no.1 to deliver idlis at his home. The fight started only because the deceased went to the house of accused no.1. He submitted that the post-mortem notes show that the deceased sustained one cut injury on his neck and one minor injury to his finger. He further submitted that there was a sudden fight between the deceased and the accused no.1, and in their sudden fight, without any premeditation, the accused no.1 assaulted the deceased. He would, therefore, submit that this is a case where Exception 4 of Section 300 of IPC will apply, and thus, it will amount to an offence under Part 1 of Section 304 of IPC. He relied upon various decisions of this Court in the cases of:- (i) No.15138812Y L/Nk Gursewak Singh v. Union of India & Anr.1 (ii) Ram Manohar Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh2 (iii) Ghapoo Yadav & Ors. v. the State of M.P.3 (iv) Sukhbir Singh v. State of Haryana4 (v) Sandhya Jadhav v. State of Maharashtra5 (vi) Prakash Chand v.

Digital Supreme Court Reports 4. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent - State urged that the evidence of PW-2 to PW-5 is free of any material contradictions and omissions and, thus, inspires confidence. He submitted that the fact that accused no.1, after a dispute with the deceased, entered his house, brought billhook and then assaulted the deceased shows that there was a clear intention on his part to assault the deceased. Learned counsel submitted that after one blow was given by the accused no.1 on the index finger of the deceased, the deceased attempted to run away. Both the accused chased the deceased; the accused no.2 held the deceased, and after that, accused no.1 gave a fatal blow to the neck of the deceased with Billhook. He urged that Exception 4 of Section 300 of IPC will not apply in this case. OUR VIEW 5. We have perused the evidence of the material prosecution witnesses. PW-1 is the father of the deceased, who had admittedly not seen the incident. PW-2 is the mother of the deceased.
