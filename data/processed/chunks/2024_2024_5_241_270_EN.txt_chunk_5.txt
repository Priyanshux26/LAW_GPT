Section 2 provides that subject to the other provisions of this Act, the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 shall apply to the whole state of Rajasthan on and from 01.04.1958. Section 3(v) provides that reference in the Indian Act to ‘government’ shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be construed as reference to the state government. Section 3A(1) provides for payment of stamp duty in cash when stamps are not available for sale. 3.1 Rule 2(d) of the Rajasthan Stamp Rules, 1955 defines government as state government and Rule 3 provides for the mode of payment of stamp duty to the state government. 3.2 Relying on these provisions, specifically Section 3A(1), the High Court held that the appellant should have paid the stamp duty in cash and the receipt would be affixed on the instrument as envisaged under this provision. It was also held that there was no legal sanction under the scheme of the Act that permits the appellant to purchase such stamps from outside the state in case 4 In S.B.
