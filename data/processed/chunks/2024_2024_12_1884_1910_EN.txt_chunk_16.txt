The Court treated the relief for possession as consequential prayer and the relief for cancellation of Sale Deed as the substantive prayer. 37. In such circumstances referred to above, the Court held that if a composite suit is filed for cancellation of Sale Deed as well as for recovery of possession, the limitation period should be considered with respect to the substantive relief of cancellation of Sale Deed which would be three years from the date of knowledge of Sale Deed sought to be cancelled. 38. The dictum as laid in Rajpal Singh (supra) cannot be made applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case on hand. The reason is simple. Ordinarily when, a suit is filed for cancellation of Sale Deed and recovery of possession, the same would suggest that the title of the plaintiff has already been lost. By seeking to get the Sale Deed 1910 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports set aside on the grounds as may have been urged in the plaint, the plaintiff could be said to be trying to regain his title over the suit property and recover the possession. In such circumstances, the period of limitation would be three years and not twelve years. 39. In view of the aforesaid discussion, this appeal fails and is hereby dismissed. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
