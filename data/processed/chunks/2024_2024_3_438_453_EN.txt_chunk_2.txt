Act does not prescribe any mode of recovery of the compensation amount from the complainant together with interest as provided in s.143A(4), as sub-section (4) provides for refund of interim compensation by the complainant to the accused and as sub-section (5) provides for mode of recovery of the interim compensation, obviously for recovery of interim compensation from the complainant, the mode of recovery will be as provided in s.421 of the CrPC – It may be a long-drawn process involved for the recovery of the amount from the complainant – If the complainant [2024] 3 S.C.R. 441 Rakesh Ranjan Shrivastava v. The State of Jharkhand & Anr. has no assets, the recovery will be impossible. [Para 12] Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – ss.148, 143A – Tests applicable for the exercise of jurisdiction u/s.148(1) not to apply u/s.143A(1): Held: Sub-section (1) of s.148 confers on the Appellate Court a power to direct the appellant/accused to deposit 20 per cent of the compensation amount – It operates at a different level as the power thereunder can be exercised only after the appellant/accused is convicted after a full trial – In the case of s.143A, the power can be exercised even before the accused is held guilty – s.143A can be invoked before the conviction of the accused, and therefore, the word “may” used therein can never be construed as “shall” – The tests applicable for the exercise of jurisdiction u/sub-section (1) of s.148 can never apply to the exercise of jurisdiction u/sub-section (1) of s.143A of the N.I. Act. [Paras 13, 15.1] Words and expressions – ‘may’ – Interpretation: Held: The word “may” ordinarily does not mean “must” – Ordinarily, “may” will not be construed as “shall” – But this is not an inflexible rule – The use of the word “may” in certain legislations can be construed as “shall”, and the word “shall” can be construed as “may” – It all depends on the nature of the power conferred by the relevant provision of the statute and the effect of the exercise of the power – The legislative intent also plays a role in the interpretation of such provisions – Even the context in which the word “may” has been used is also relevant.
