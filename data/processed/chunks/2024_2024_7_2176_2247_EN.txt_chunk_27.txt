College Management Committee, Unchahar, Rai Bareilly (1992) 1 UPLBEC 30:- “… 30. Where the services of a teacher were terminated, the Court held that the writ petition under Article 226 is not maintainable as the institution cannot be treated as the instrumentality of the State. The matter was considered in detail in Harbans Kaur v. Guru Tegh Bahadur Public School [Harbans Kaur v. Guru Tegh Bahadur Public School, 1992 SCC OnLine All 444 : 1992 Lab IC 2070], wherein the services of the petitioner were terminated by the Managing Committee of the institution recognised by CBSE. It was held that the Affiliation Bye-laws framed by CBSE have no statutory force. The Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India can enforce compliance of statutory provision against a committee of management as held in a Full Bench decision of this Court in Aley Ahmad Abidi v. District Inspector of Schools [Aley Ahmad Abidi v. District Inspector of Schools, 1976 SCC OnLine [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2215 Army Welfare Education Society New Delhi v. Sunil Kumar Sharma & Ors. Etc. All 325 : AIR 1977 All 539]. The Affiliation Bye- laws of CBSE having no statutory force, the only remedy against the aggrieved person is to approach CBSE putting his grievances in relation to the violation of the Affiliation Bye-laws by the institution.” 35. Thus, where a teacher or non-teaching staff challenges the action of Committee of Management that it has violated the terms of contract or the rules of the Affiliation Bye-laws, the appropriate remedy of such teacher or employee is to approach CBSE or to take such other legal remedy available under law. It is open to CBSE to take appropriate action against the Committee of Management of the institution for withdrawal of recognition in case it finds that the Committee of Management has not performed its duties in accordance with the Affiliation Byelaws. 36. It needs no elaboration to state that a school affiliated to CBSE which is unaided is not a State within Article 12 of the Constitution of India [see Satimbla Sharma v. St Paul’s Senior Secondary School (2011) 13 SCC 760 : (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 75 . Nevertheless the school discharges a public duty of imparting education which is a fundamental right of the citizen [see K. Krishnamacharyulu v. Sri Venkateswara Hindu College of Engineering (1997) 3 SCC 571 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 841. The school affiliated to CBSE is therefore an “authority” amenable to the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India [see Binny Ltd. v. V. Sadasivan (2005) 6 SCC 657 : 2005 SCC (L&S) 881] ]. However, a judicial review of the action challenged by a party can be had by resort to the writ jurisdiction only if there is a public law element and not to enforce a contract of personal service. A contract of personal service includes all matters relating to the service of the employee — confirmation, suspension, transfer, termination, etc. [see Apollo Tyres Ltd. v. C.P.
