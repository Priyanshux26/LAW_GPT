The decision in Gopal Lal’s case (supra), and the prescription of maximum corporeal sentence imposable under Sections 494 and 495 I.P.C., would undoubtedly suggest that the offence under Section 494 I.P.C., has to be treated as a serious offence. 15. When once it is found that an offence under Section 494 I.P.C., is a serious offence, the circumstances obtaining in this case would constrain us to hold that the imposition of ‘imprisonment till the rising of the court’ is not a proper sentence falling in tune with the rule of proportionality in providing punishment as mentioned hereinbefore. 16. It is a fact that earlier certain High Courts maintained a view that sentencing an accused to undergo ‘imprisonment till the rising of the court’ would be no sentence at all, according to law. (See the decisions in Shew Shankar Singh v. The State and Ors.,9 Assan Musaliarakath Kunhi Bava In Re.,10 and The Public Prosecutor v. Kanniappan11). In the said decisions of the Madras High Court, it was held that a sentence of ‘imprisonment till the rising of the court’ is an evasion of the statutory provision. In this context, it is also to be noted that a contra view was taken by a Division Bench of the Madras High Court in Muthu Nadar, In Re..12 The Division Bench held that unless the penal provision provides any fixed term as the minimum, the court has full discretion to pass a sentence of imprisonment for any period if it would be fit. In the decision in Prahlad Dnyanoba Gajbhiye v. State of Maharashtra and Anr.,13 the High Court of Bombay held that every confinement of person and every restraint of liberty of free men is imprisonment. It is to be noted that taking into account the proviso to Section 418(1), Cr.P.C., in the decision in Raveendran v. Food Inspector, Pinarayi Panchayat,14 the High Court of Kerala held that the proviso to Section 418(1), 9 MANU/WB/0349/1968 10 AIR 1929 Mad 226 11 AIR 1955 Mad 424 12 AIR 1945 Mad 313 13 (1994) Cri LJ 2555 14 1977 KLT 155 792 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Cr.P.C., recognises sentence of detention till the rising of court is imprisonment of the description simple imprisonment. We refer to the aforesaid decisions and provisions to say that now it cannot be said that imposing a sentence of ‘imprisonment till the rising of the court’ is impermissible or an action amounting to evasion of statutory provision(s). The said provision viz., Section 418(1), Cr.P.C., and its proviso reads thus:- “418. Execution of sentence of imprisonment. — (1) Where the accused is sentenced to imprisonment for life or to imprisonment for a term in cases other than those provided for by section 413, the Court passing the sentence shall forthwith forward a warrant to the jail or other place in which he is, or is to be, confined, and, unless the accused is already confined in such jail or other place, shall forward him to such jail or other place, with the warrant: Provided that where the accused is sentenced to imprisonment till the rising of the Court, it shall not be necessary to prepare or forward a warrant to a jail, and the accused may be confined in such place as the Court may direct.” 17.
