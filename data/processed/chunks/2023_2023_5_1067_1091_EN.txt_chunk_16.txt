[DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] respondent was free to deposit the balance amount of sale price and A take possession of the auctioned immovable property. The contesting respondent not having deposited the balance amount of sale price by 23rd October, 2018, the mutual agreement for extension of time, thus, lapsed with effect from 24th October, 2017. This resulted in the of forfeiture being passed by the Authorized Officer in terms of sub-rule B (5). 26. We do not see reason to hold that there has either been any manifest arbitrariness or unreasonableness, which warranted interdiction with the of forfeiture. The contesting respondent in terms of the statutory ordainment was required to pay the balance amount of sale C price on or before 15 days of confirmation of sale. Days prior to expiry of such period, he prayed for an extension of 25 days. Such prayer was granted. Further prayer for extension was made ten days after receipt of summons from the DRT. The exact date on which the contesting respondent applied before the DRT for extension of time as well as the exact terms of the passed on such application, however, is not D available on record. We shall proceed on the premise that the prayer for extension of time was not granted. The of the Authorized Officer dated 24th October, 2017 forfeiting 25% of the sale price was also not challenged by the contesting respondent before the DRT in any independent proceeding; on the contrary, after the DRAT granted E permission to the Authorized Officer to conduct sale afresh by its dated 12th December, 2017 and pursuant whereto a fresh e-auction notice was issued on 18th December, 2017, the contesting respondent had instituted an independent application under section 17(1) of the SARFAESI Act before the DRT and had also filed I.A. No. 2542/2017 therein for interim stay of e-auction. The DRT by its dated 3rd F January, 2018 dismissed I.A. No. 2542/2017 relying upon the of the DRAT dated 12th December, 2017, but permitted the contesting respondent to participate in the e- auction to be held on 5th January, 2018 which failed for want of bidders. It is then that the contesting respondent instituted the writ petition before the High Court. G 27. Under such circumstances, it has to be held that the transaction fell through by reason of the default or failure of the contesting respondent to deposit 75% of the sale price by 23rd October, 2017, as per the terms of rule 9(4). On facts, we find that the contesting respondent was arranging for funds when he received the summons from the DRT on H 1088 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 10th October, 2017. It is, therefore, clear that at least till that date, the contesting respondent was lacking in financial resources to make payment of the entire sale price. Although it is not always necessary for an auction purchaser to arrange for funds and be ready to pay the entire sale price within 15 days of confirmation of sale, since extension of time is contemplated in rule 9, it is beyond our comprehension why the contesting B respondent while applying for an extension of time on 27th September, 2017 sought for only 25 days’ time and not for more time, at least up to the entire period of ninety days, being the maximum time that he could have asked for and made available to him in terms of rule 9(4).
