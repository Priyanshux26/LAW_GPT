He once again contradicted himself by stating that he did not record the statement of Hukum Singh on the spot, B while acknowledging that the statements of P.W.12 (Hakim Singh) and Bhogiram were not taken by him. A further statement has been given that he was given a verbal . 20. As an Investigating Officer, this witness was expected to tell the truth. Though a report of the investigating officer would constitute C an opinion, the very case of the prosecution that it is he who recorded the statement of the deceased taken in the form of the first information report creates a very serious doubt. It is apparent that his evidence is not only contradictory, but also destructive. 21. Having discussed the evidence available on record, we shall D now consider the approach of the Trial Court and the High Court. DECISIONS OF THE COURTS: 22. Both the Courts below have relied upon the prosecution witnesses heavily. The depositions of the eye witnesses found favour with the Courts. Much reliance was also placed on the statement by the E deceased in the Dehati Nalishi. The contradictions pointed out were not taken due note of. The statements of the witnesses were corroborated with each other with respect to the occurrence. Having found that there were two homicidal deaths, a final conclusion was arrived at by holding the appellants guilty. F SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANTS: 23. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants, placing reliance on the written arguments given, submitted that there are three different first information reports as per the prosecution version. The discrepancies in the statement of the prosecution witnesses are either G self-contradictory or against each other. 24. No witness has spoken about recording of Dehati Nalishi, as deposed by P.W.20. The condition of the deceased Hukum Singh was unconscious. The language used in Ex. P-28 indicates that of a legally trained mind. The thumb impression of the deceased Hukum Singh was H RANVIR SINGH ETC. ETC. v. THE STATE OF MADHYA 851 PRADESH [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] not proved, and its placement creates a serious doubt. P.W.20 contradicts A himself on various counts. He did not disclose the name of the person who furnished the information. The earlier version of this report was suppressed on purpose. 25. There is absolutely no explanation for not examining P.W.12, who even under Ex. P-28 was shown as an eye witness. There were B about more than 50 to 100 persons present and involved. The charge under Section 149 IPC is not made out as there was no explanation for not including the scores of other persons. 26. To substantiate the aforesaid contentions, the Learned Counsel has placed reliance on the following decisions of this Court: C • Charan Singh and Others v. State of U.P., (2004) 4 SCC 205; • Najabhai Desurbhai Wagh v. Valerabhai Deganbhai Vagh and Others, (2017) 3 SCC 261; D • Balmukund Sharma v. State of Bihar, (2019) 5 SCC 469; • Vyas Ram v.
