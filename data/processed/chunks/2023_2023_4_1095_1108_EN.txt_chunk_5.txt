A 14. We have heard Shri Shubham Arya, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants and Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents. 15. Shri Arya submitted that, considering the definition of “Law” given in the PPA, the communication dated 19thJune 2013 would squarely B fall under the term “Law”. He submitted that in any case, CERC had refused to answer the said issue in the absence of other distributors. It is submitted that APTEL has grossly erred in holding the same not to be a ‘Change in Law’ event. 16. Dr. Singhvi, on the other hand, submitted that the communication C dated 19th June 2013 is an inter- departmental communication and the same cannot be held to be ‘Change in Law’. 17. When we heard this batch of Electricity appeals, it was agreed between all the parties that this Court should first decide Civil Appeal No. 684 of 2021 (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited v. Adani Power Maharashtra Limited and Others2) D [“MSEDCL v. APML and Others”, for short] and Civil Appeal No. 6927 of 2021 (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited v. GMR Warora Energy Ltd. and Others) inasmuch as three of the issues involved in all the appeals in the batch were common. It was submitted that those two appeals could be decided by deciding the E three common issues. However, insofar as the other appeals are concerned, it was submitted that, in addition to the three common issues, certain additional issues were also involved and it was agreed that after those two appeals are decided, the other appeals should be heard for considering these additional issues. F 18. The said three common issues are thus: (i) Whether ‘Change in Law’ relief on account of NCDP 2013 should be on ‘actuals’ viz. as against 100% of normative coal requirement assured in terms of NCDP 2007 OR restricted to trigger levels in NCDP 2013 viz. 65%, 65%, G 67% and 75% of Assured Coal Quantity (ACQ)? (ii) Whether for computing ‘Change in Law’ relief, the operating parameters be considered on ‘actuals’ OR as per technical information submitted in bid? H 2 2023 SCC OnLine SC 233 UTTAR HARYANA BIJLI VITRAN NIGAM LTD. v. ADANI 1103 POWER (MUNDRA) LTD. [B. R. GAVAI, J.] (iii) Whether ‘Change in Law’ relief compensation is to be A granted from 1stApril 2013 (start of Financial Year) or 31st July 2013 (date of NCDP 2013)? 19. After extensively hearing all the learned counsel for the parties, vide the and dated 3rd March 2023 in the case of MSEDCL v. APML and Others (supra), this Court decided those two B appeals after considering the aforesaid three issues. 20. The first issue was answered by this Court, holding that the ‘Change in Law’ relief for domestic coal shortfall should be on ‘actuals’ i.e. as against 100% of normative coal requirement assured in terms of NCDP, 2007. Insofar as the second issue is concerned, it was held that C the Station Heat Rate (“SHR” for short) and Auxiliary consumption should be considered as per the Regulations or actuals, whichever is lower.
