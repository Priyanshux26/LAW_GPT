Further, if an action is to be carried out by way of issuance of a particular statutory instrument on the basis of certain requirements, such action cannot be validly carried out by way of issuance of an instrument when the same is not contemplated under the statute. 2114 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 42.21 It is also noted that at the crucial 147th meeting of GEAC held on 18.10.2022, there was no representative of the ICMR, Ministry of Health. Hence, the matter was not considered from the paradigm of the adverse effect on the health of human beings and animals as well as on other plants in the event of environmental release. Dr. Geeta Jotwani, Scientist F, ICMR, who did not participate in the meeting of GEAC held on 18.10.2022, simply sent an e-mail to the effect that she had concurred with the recommendation of GEAC even in the absence of knowledge about the deliberations of the GEAC. 42.22 In this regard, I also find that the recommendations of the TEC submitted to this Court have been completely ignored by GEAC, as another Expert Committee was constituted by it pursuant to the letter dated 10.05.2022 submitted by Prof. Pental to the Hon’ble Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change. It is also not known whether the TEC report was placed before GEAC as well as the Expert Committee or that they had ever been apprised of the same. I observe that Prof. Pental’s letter dated 10.05.2022 to the Hon’ble Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is a classic case of seeking a lateral intervention by the Minister of the Union of India, bypassing what had been decided by GEAC in its 137th meeting held on 20.03.2019. It is clear that pursuant to the intervention of the Ministry, GEAC constituted another Expert Committee and simply accepted its recommendations for the environmental release of DMH-11 hybrid mustard. This was by ignoring all previous deliberation made by GEAC, its sub-committee constituted earlier and its decision to proceed with precaution. 43. Having regard to the aforesaid discussion, I am of the view that the GEAC approval dated 18.10.2022 and the consequent decision dated 25.10.2022 regarding the environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 is vitiated. I also find that the impugned approval was in gross violation of the principle of public trust. Re: Point No.2: Whether the decision to grant approval for environmental release of DMH-11 violates the right to safe and healthy environment under Article 21? [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2115 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. Right to safe and healthy Environment: 43.1 I next consider whether the right to safe and healthy environment would be violated by unanticipated adverse effects of the impugned approval for environmental release of DMH-11. While I am cognizant of the submission of the learned Attorney General that the Court cannot go into the nuances of science and technology and give a finding on their merits, at the same time, I do not find substance in his argument that the petitioners’ apprehensions are only a baseless hypothesis.
