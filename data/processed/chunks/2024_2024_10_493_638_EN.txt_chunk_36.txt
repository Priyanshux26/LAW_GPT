It was noted, “Prison administrators have the human tendency of attempting to cover up their lapses and so shun disclosure thereof… Interviews become necessary as otherwise the correct information may not be collected but such access has got to be controlled and regulated.” 64. In Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa,99 this Court emphasized “great responsibility on the police or prison authorities to ensure that the citizen in its custody is not deprived of his right to life”. 97 [1981] 2 SCR 516 : (1981) 1 SCC 608 98 Sheela Barse v. State of Maharashtra (1987) 4 SCC 373 99 [1993] 2 SCR 581 : (1993) 2 SCC 746 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 547 Sukanya Shantha v. Union of India & Ors. While confinement inherently restricts a person’s liberty, the limited freedom they retain becomes all the more valuable. The State has a strict duty of care in such situations, without exception. This Court declared that if a person in police custody is deprived of life, except according to the procedure established by law, the wrongdoer is held accountable, and the State is ultimately responsible. 65. This Court laid down guidelines on arrest and detention in D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal,100 while highlighting the constitutional violations caused due to custodial violence and deaths in police lock- ups. It noted, “If the functionaries of the Government become law- breakers, it is bound to breed contempt for law and would encourage lawlessness and every man would have the tendency to become law unto himself thereby leading to anarchism”. In Mehmood Nayyar Azam v. State of Chhattisgarh,101 it was noted that a person in custody has “his basic human rights” and human dignity, and that the police officers cannot treat him in an inhuman manner. It was held that even “any treatment meted out to an accused while he is in custody which causes humiliation and mental trauma corrodes the concept of human dignity”. 66. In Shabnam v. Union of India,102 this Court elucidated the principle that human dignity should be preserved even when a prisoner is sentenced to death. The Court held, “the process/procedure from confirmation of death sentence by the highest court till the execution of the said sentence, the convict is to be treated with human dignity to the extent which is reasonable and permissible in law”. Similarly, in ‘X’ v. State of Maharashtra,103 the Court while holding that “post conviction severe mental illness will be a mitigating factor” in commuting the death sentence, emphasized that the “right to dignity of an accused does not dry out with the Judges’ ink, rather, it subsists well beyond the prison gates and operates until his last breath”. 67. Thus, the jurisprudence which emerges on the rights of prisoners under Article 21 is that even the incarcerated have inherent dignity. They are to be treated in a humanely and without cruelty.
