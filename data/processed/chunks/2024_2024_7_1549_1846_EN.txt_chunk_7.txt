s.9 sought to remedy the disparity of royalty rates across India – Rates of royalty were primarily governed by the terms of lease prior to the enactment of the MMDR Act – Once a mining lease was entered into between a lessor and lessee, the rates of royalty would remain static during the subsistence of the lease – s.9 has enabled the Central Government to examine the rates of royalty in respect of all minerals and modulate them periodically after taking into consideration various factors, including the uniformity of mineral prices – Primary reason for empowering the Central Government to fix the rate of royalty could be traced to the Industrial Policy Resolution which underscored the active and predominant role of the State in organizing and utilizing mineral resources – State Governments were not empowered to determine royalty in to maintain a uniform regime of royalty across India – This was intended to promote domestic industry and maintain competitive commodity prices in the international market.

Royalty is not a tax but a statutory consideration payable by the lessee to the lessor for the exercise of mineral rights – Specification of rates of royalty with respect to major minerals under the MMDR Act limits the powers of the State Government in terms of Entry 54 List I read with Entry 23 List II – Royalty is payable u/s.9 on the removal or consumption of minerals by the lessee in the leased area – Thus, essentially royalty is payable on the dispatch of minerals from the leased area – Rates of royalty are generally calculated on per tonnage basis or ad valorem basis on the basis of the formula laid down – Royalty is calculated on the basis of the quantity of minerals extracted or removed – Yield from mineral bearing land is nothing but the quantity of mineral produced – Royalty is per se not the yield from a mineral bearing land, but the yield (mineral produced) is the important factor in determination of the rate of royalty – Moreover, royalty can be considered as an income if it is paid to a private landowner – In case minerals are vested in the State, royalty is paid to the State Government, and hence assumes the form of non-tax revenues – Thus, royalty is relatable to the yield of the mineral-bearing land as well as the income in case the minerals vest in a private person.
