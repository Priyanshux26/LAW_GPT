3 Issued under Section 7B of the Citizenship Act, 1955. 948 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. indicated an exception that OCI card holder are ineligible for admissions to seats exclusively reserved for Indian citizens. 10. Mr. Navare argued that the notifi cation was the subject matter of a of this court in Anushka Rengunthwar & Ors. V. Union of India & Ors4. It was submitted that this court recognized that the Central government could issue the notifi cation of the kind which it did on 04.03.2021 in regard to the matters, enumerated or provided for. Yet at the same time, the Court categorically ruled that retrospective eff ect could not be given to that notifi cation and that despite it seemingly on its application it did have an element of retroactive application. The court ruled that the OCI card holder status meant that persons like petitioner are treated as overseas citizens of India and Sections 7A to 7D of the Citizenship Act, 1955, (hereafter “the 1955 Act”) enacted the procedure for their registration and cancellation, keeping in mind that the earlier notifi cation dated 11.04.2005, 05.01.2007 and 05.01.2009 had enabled such OCI cardholders to apply for educational institutions in India and the state could not deny them such benefi ts abruptly. It was emphasized that the Court, therefore, declared that the operation of notifi cation which provided for supersession of earlier notifi cations and clause 4 (ii) and its proviso and explanation could operate only prospectively in respect of OCI Card holder who have secured admission consequently on04.03.2021.It was submitted that in the present case the OCI card was issued to the petitioner prior to that date,i.e., on 02.11.2015. 11. Mr. Atul Kumar, learned counsel relied upon the notifi cation dated 04.03.2021 and submitted that this Court in Anushka(supra) clearly held that it had prospective eff ect. This meant that for all subsequent years i.e., after 2021-22, the notifi cation was applicable. It was contended that in any event since the petitioner was born much prior to 04.03.2021, the application of the notifi cation (04.03.2021) operated with eff ect from the date of the i.e., 03.02.2023. 12. AIIMS fi nds fault with the petitioner for not disclosing that she was an OCI Card holder prior to 04.03.2021, which had to be viewed as a special factor regard upon had to the law declared in Anushka (supra). 4 2023 SCC Online SC 102.
