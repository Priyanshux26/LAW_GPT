Bail – Scope of interference – Respondent No.1 was specifi cally named as the main conspirator in the murder of his wife – However, change of stance by most vital witnesses, the family members of the deceased within 20 days of their examination-in-chief – Allegations made against Respondent No.1 in the past, of infl uencing the police, hiring goons, repeatedly assaulting the deceased and various attempts to take away her life – Cancellation of bail: Held: This Court has a narrow scope of interference in an granting bail while exercising its power of judicial review and will be invariably reluctant to interfere in such even if it has a diff erent opinion – Courts often grapple with balancing the most precious right to liberty embodied in Article 21 on one hand and the right of the ly society, on the other – The delicate balance in the case of long incarceration is drawn by releasing a suspect on bail on such terms and conditions that will ensure that a fair and free trial is not hampered – However, if it is found that an undertrial has attempted to misuse the concession of bail either by infl uencing the witnesses or tampering with the evidence or trying to fl ee from justice, such person can be committed to custody by withdrawing the concession of bail – In the present case, the Appellant (mother of the Deceased) was vigorously pursuing this appeal seeking cancellation of bail given to Respondent No.1 – In her examination-in-chief, she specifi cally 1058 MUNILAKSHMI v.
