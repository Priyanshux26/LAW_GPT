11. While so, some candidates filed W.P. No. 23828 of 2022 before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur assailing the decision of the MPPSC to cancel the result of the main examination held earlier on the ground that they would be required to reappear for the said examination despite clearing it in the first instance. The petitioners in SLP (C) No. 5817 of 2023, from which this appeal arises, intervened in the said writ petition and they were also heard. This writ petition was filed on 13.10.2022. 12. At that stage, Review Petition Nos. 1112 and 1175 of 2022 were filed seeking clarification of the dated 07.04.2022 in Kishor Choudhary (supra). However, by dated 18.11.2022, the Division Bench disposed of the review petitions leaving it open to the writ Court to consider and interpret its earlier dated 07.04.2022. This was passed as the Division Bench was informed of the fact that a fresh writ petition, viz., W.P. No. 23828 of 2022, was pending consideration. 13. A learned Judge of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh allowed W.P. No. 23828 of 2022 and batch, titled ‘Harshit Jain and others vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and another’ on 29.11.2022. Therein, the learned Judge noted that four categories of candidates emerged: [2024] 6 S.C.R. 45 Deependra Yadav and Others v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Others (i) the newly qualified reservation category candidates for the main examination (2,721, in number), as per the result dated 10.10.2022; (ii) 1,918 select list candidates, who had passed the main examination held from 21.03.2021 to 26.03.2021 and qualified for the interview; (iii) candidates out of these 1,918 candidates, who would be ousted from that select list of 1,918 candidates, if the special main examination is conducted and the results are normalized; and (iv) 8,894 candidates, out of the 10,767 candidates, who had appeared for the main examination earlier but could not pass it. 14. The learned Judge observed that if the result of the main examination was cancelled, a premium would be given to the candidates from the fourth category by reviving their candidature, though they had failed to qualify in the first instance, and a right would be taken away from candidates who had already cleared the main examination and qualified for the interview. The learned Judge opined that this would cause serious prejudice and grave injustice to candidates who were declared eligible and had qualified in the short-listing process and that holding the entire main examination afresh would not only result in incurring huge costs but would also cause grave injustice to a large number of candidates, who had already cleared the main examination and were short-listed for the interview, without any fault on their part. Holding so, the learned Judge invalidated the decision taken by the MPPSC on 10.10.2022, proposing to hold a fresh main examination by cancelling the earlier one, and directed the MPPSC to hold a special main examination, as was done by it earlier on several occasions, for the new eligible reservation category candidates, as per the redrawn preliminary examination result.
