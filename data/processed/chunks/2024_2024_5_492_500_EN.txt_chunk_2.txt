(Amendment) Act 8 of 1963), claiming that whereabouts of Kalyan Singh were unknown and hence his name may be expunged from the ownership entry of the revenue record. The Consolidation Officer passed an dated 08.05.1960 on the basis of a report dated 17.03.1960 of the Assistant Consolidation Officer, which inter alia claimed that Kalyan Singh – co-tenure holder had not been heard for last 8 of 10 years, he did not arrive in the village and an affidavit to this effect was filed by his uncle Ramji Lal. Since all efforts to secure service on Kalyan Singh failed, the Consolidation Officer, “in the interest of correction of record”, expunged the name of Kalyan Singh from the record and declared his civil death. On this premise, Ramji Lal (later on his legal representatives) started claiming to be the sole owner(s) of the entire land holding of Angat. 4. Kalyan Singh then instituted Suit No.19/1985 on 12.03.1985 before the Assistant Collector, First Class, Haridwar for declaration of his half share in the suit property. The suit was decreed in his favor. Ramji Lal filed an appeal, which was dismissed on 06.08.1986. Ramji Lal then approached the Board of Revenue in a Second Appeal. That appeal was allowed in part on 31.07.1989 and the suit was remanded with a direction to adjudicate the dispute regarding Khasra No.115 afresh after forming an issue with respect to applicability of Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. Kalyan Singh challenged the aforesaid of the Board of Revenue before the High Court. His writ petition has been allowed by the High Court vide impugned dated 16.01.2013. 5. We have heard learned senior counsel on behalf of the appellants as well as learned senior counsel who is representing the prospective vendees in whose favour Kalyan Singh had allegedly executed an agreement to sale and a mortgage deed. The other learned counsels representing the interested parties have also been heard and the material placed on record perused. 6. The sheet anchor of Mr. S.R. Singh, learned senior counsel for the appellants, is Section 49 of the 1953 Act. It is urged that the dated 08.05.1960 passed by the Competent Authority in exercise of its powers under that provision, having attained finality, Kalyan Singh lost his right, title or interest in the subject land. It is contended that not only the subsequent suit filed by Kalyan Singh was expressly precluded under the said provision, such a suit was hopelessly time 496 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports barred. It is then argued that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in interfering with the of remand passed by the Board of Revenue for determination of the legal issue as to maintainability of a simpliciter suit for declaration, without seeking consequential relief of possession filed by Kalyan Singh. The Board, it is asserted, rightly remanded the suit for determination of its maintainability keeping in mind Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. 7. Contrarily, it is urged by learned senior counsel/other counsels for the respondents that neither Section 49 of the 1953 Act was attracted in the instant case nor the Consolidation Officer was competent to rob off Kalyan Singh of his ancestral right as a tenure holder on the subject land.
