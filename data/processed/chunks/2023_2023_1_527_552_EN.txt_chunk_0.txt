A Dismissing the appeal, the Court HELD: 1.1 The rectificatory jurisdiction under Section 59 of the Companies Act,2013 is summary in nature and not intended to be exercised where there are contested facts and disputed questions. Transactions falling within the jurisdiction of Regulatory bodies created under a statute must necessarily be subjected to B their ex- ante scrutiny, enquiry and adjudication. Therefore, the submission that the National Company Law tribunal under Section 59 exercises a parallel jurisdiction with Securities and Exchange Board of India for addressing violations of the Regulations framed under the SEBI Act is rejected. The scope and ambit of Section 155 of the 1956 Act, as it then existed, fell for consideration in a C decision of this Court in Ammonia Supplies’s case.
