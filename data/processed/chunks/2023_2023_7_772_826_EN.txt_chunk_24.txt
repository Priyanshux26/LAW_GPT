Clause (2) of Article 311 requires that before a government servant is dismissed, removed or reduced in rank, an inquiry must be held in which he is informed of the charges against him and given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of those charges…….” G - [emphasis supplied] At the same time, a note of caution was added in the captioned case and the Court observed that the rules of natural justice are neither statutory rules nor are they cast in stone. They are flexible and can be adapted and modified by statutes, depending on the exigencies of different H AURELIANO FERNANDES v. STATE OF GOA AND OTHERS 805 [HIMA KOHLI, J.] situations, the facts and circumstances of the case and the framework A of the law54. 44. In Swadeshi Cotton Mills v. Union of India55, in his dissenting , Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy, had made the following pertinent observations :- B “106. The principles of natural justice have taken deep root in the judicial conscience of our people, nurtured by Dr. Bina pani56, A.K. Kraipak57, Mohinder Singh Gill58, Maneka Gandhi59. They are now considered so fundamental as to be “implicit in the concept of ed liberty and, therefore, implicit in every decision-making function, call it judicial, quasi-judicial or C administrative. Where authority functions under a statute and the statute provides for the observance of the principles of natural justice in a particular manner, natural justice will have to be observed in that manner and in no other. No wider right than that provided by statute can be claimed D nor can the right be narrowed. Where the statute is silent about the observance of the principles of natural justice, such statutory silence is taken to imply compliance with the principles of natural justice. The implication of natural justice being presumptive it may be excluded by express words of statute or by necessary intendment. Where the conflict is between E the public interest and the private interest, the presumption must necessarily be weak and may, therefore, be readily displaced……” - [emphasis supplied] 45. Thus, ordinarily, courts interpret statutory provisions in sync with the aforesaid principles of natural justice on a premise that no F statutory authority would violate the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. When it comes to authorities that are expected to discharge judicial and quasi-judicial functions, the rule of audi alteram partem applies with equal force. Reasonableness infuses lifeblood in procedural G 54 Also refer : A.K.Kraipak and others v. Union of India and Others, (1969) 2 SCC 262 and Union of India v. Col. J.N.
