Noticing these circumstances this Court held : (SCC p. 481, para 4) ‘4. In view of this corroborative evidence we find no substance in the argument urged on behalf of the appellant that the investigating officer ought to have held an identifi cation parade and that the failure of Munshi Ram to mention the names of the two accused to the neighbours who came to the scene immediately after the occurrence shows that his story cannot be true. As observed by this Court in Jadunath Singh v. State of U.P. [(1970) 3 SCC 518 : 1971 SCC (Cri) 124] absence of test identifi cation is not necessarily fatal. The fact that Munshi Ram did not disclose the names of the two accused to the villagers only shows that the accused were not previously known to him and the story that the accused referred to each other by their respective MUKESH SINGH v. THE STATE (NCT OF DELHI) 927 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] names during the course of the incident contains an element of exaggeration. The case does not rest on the evidence of Munshi Ram alone and the corroborative circumstances to which we have referred to above lend enough assurance to the implication of the appellant.’ “ 57. Applying the aforesaid principles of law as discernable from the various decisions referred to above, we may now proceed to look into the evidence on record so as to consider whether the conviction of the appellant convict for the alleged off ence is sustainable or not.
