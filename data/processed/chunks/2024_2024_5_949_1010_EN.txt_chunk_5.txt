XVLII does not end with the circumstances – Review power u/s. 114 read with XLVII, CPC is available to be exercised, subject to fulfilment of the conditions, on setting up by the review petitioner any of the following grounds: discovery of new and important matter or evidence; or mistake or error apparent on the face of the record; or any other sufficient reason. [Paras 34, 38, 39] Constitution of India – Art. 142 – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – ss. 114, 151, XLVII – Inherent powers – Review power – Distinction: Held: Constitutional courts have inherent powers and this Court is also vested by Art. 142 of the Constitution with powers to pass such decree or make such as is necessary to do complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it – Superior court, in exercise of its inherent power, is authorized to do justice that the cause before it demands – Upon satisfaction being reached by a court that a mistake has been committed by it, which is gross and palpable, it is not the law that the mistake has to be corrected by exercising the power of review only – Such power can be exercised, only if the person aggrieved by the or decree applies therefor – On its terms, s. 114 CPC rw Ord.
