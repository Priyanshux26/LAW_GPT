The Circumstance Disclosure Statement of the appellant E and the Recovery of incriminating articles 31. Conjoint reading of the testimonies of PW 12 and PW 13 further renders the prosecution case to be inherently improbable, if not self-contradictory and impossible on this circumstance. 32. Unlike PW 5, who is categorical about having seen the blood- F stained nicker in the house of the appellant, PW 12 does not disclose such fact. Undisputedly, both these witnesses together visited the alleged house of the appellant only once, i.e., on 13.6.2010. It is a matter of record that police recovered only one nicker belonging to the prosecutrix, which was recovered at the time of the second search conducted on G 16.6.2010, which renders the recovery by PW 13 in the presence of PW 9 to be extremely doubtful, specifically when the search and subsequent recovery of incriminating articles is refuted. 33. There is yet another contradiction which bears significance in the attending facts and that being the time of the seizure of the articles H 166 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A recovered during the first search. The Panchnama (Ext. 36) reveals that the same was prepared in the night of 13.6.2010 between 9.00 p.m. to 9.30 p.m., whereas according to PW 5, all proceedings of recovery appear to have been completed before 2.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. by which time the witness had returned home. In fact, the factum of search itself is in doubt as PW 5 categorically states that after conducting the search B he visited the police station where his “signatures” were obtained, though, he clarifies that earlier too his signatures were taken, but on what paper and for what purpose, he did not disclose. 34. We may now proceed to the testimony of PW 13, who is the star witness of the prosecution, i.e., the Investigating Officer. According C to his version, on 16.6.2010, the appellant, while in police custody, made a disclosure statement (Ext.47) in the presence of independent witnesses PW 7 and P.K Mehta (not examined). The statement revealed the appellant to have concealed the nicker of the prosecutrix as also his clothes, worn by him at the time of incident, in his house, which he was ready to identify and get recovered. D 35. Accordingly, on 16.6.2010 PW 13 along with the Panchas, staff and the appellant searched the room No.39 of Ganesh Deval Nagar. The room was opened, and the appellant produced “amul gold 45 size nicker” and one “white colour nicker of amul gold 80 cm’s size banian” having blood stains and one “grey coloured barmuda” and one “brown E colour nicker having contents written as Sophia 65 cm” and some blood stains. The said articles were seized vide Memo Ext.48 in the presence of the Panchas. On 17.6.2010 the appellant got recorded a second disclosure statement while in custody, whereby, he stated that some additional clothes which he had worn on the day of the incident could be F got recovered.
