It was observed that the 7 [1955] 1 SCR 509 : (1954) 2 SCC 32 8 [1955] 1 SCR 1104 (1954) 2 SCC 881 416 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports said provision required, before an setting aside an election could be made, that two conditions be satisfied. It must, firstly, be shown that there has been improper reception or refusal of a vote or reception of any vote which is void, or non-compliance with the provisions of the Constitution or the Act of 1951, or any rules or s made thereunder, relating to the election or any mistake in the use of the prescribed form and it must further be shown that, as a consequence thereof, the result of the election has been materially affected. The Bench observed that the two conditions are cumulative and must both be established. It was further observed that the burden of establishing them is on the person who seeks to have the election set aside. Reference was also made to Vashist Narain (supra). 31. In Kamta Prasad Upadhyaya vs. Sarjoo Prasad Tiwari and others9, another 3-Judge Bench of this Court affirmed the legal position settled by Vashist Narain (supra). Again, in Arjun Panditrao Khotkar vs. Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal and others10, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court affirmed the view taken in Vashist Narain (supra) that, where a person whose nomination has been improperly accepted is the returned candidate himself, it may be readily conceded that the conclusion has to be that the result of the election was ‘materially affected’ without their being any necessity to plead and prove the same. 32. In Madiraju Venkata Ramana Raju vs. Peddireddigari Ramachandra Reddy and others11, another 3-Judge Bench of this Court affirmed that if there are more than two candidates and if the nomination of one of the defeated candidates has been improperly accepted, a question might arise as to whether the result of the election of the returned candidate has been materially affected by such improper reception but that would not be so in the case of challenge to the election of the returned candidate himself on the ground of improper acceptance of his nomination. 33. Ergo, if acceptance of the nomination of the returned candidate is shown to be improper, it would automatically mean that the same materially affected the result of the election and nothing more needs 9 (1969) 3 SCC 622 10 [2020] 7 SCR 180 : (2020) 7 SCC 1 11 [2018] 9 SCR 164 : (2018) 14 SCC 1 [2024] 4 S.C.R. 417 Karikho Kri v. Nuney Tayang and Another to be pleaded or proved. However, whether acceptance of the nomination of Karikho Kri was actually improper is the main issue that requires to be addressed by us. 34. We may also take note of curial wisdom on the issue as to what would be the defects that would taint a nomination to the extent of rendering its acceptance improper. In Resurgence India vs. Election Commission of India and another12, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court observed that if the Election Commission accepts nomination papers in spite of blank particulars therein, it would directly violate the fundamental right of the citizen to know the criminal antecedents, assets, liabilities and educational qualifications of the candidate.
