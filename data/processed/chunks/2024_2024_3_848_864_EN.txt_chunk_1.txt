[Paras 22, 26, 27 & 30] Judiciary – Retirement Benefits – Pensionary payments to Judges constitute a vital element in the independence of the judiciary Held: As a consequence of long years of judicial office, Judges on demitting office do not necessarily have the options which are open to members from other services – The reason why the State assumes the obligation to pay pension to the Judges is to ensure that the protection of the benefits which are available after retirement would ensure their ability to discharge their duties without “fear or favour” – The purpose of creating dignified conditions of existence for Judges both during their tenure as the Judges are vital components of the rule of law – Independence of the judiciary 850 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports is hence a vital doctrine which is recognized in the constitutional scheme – Payment of salaries and dignified pensions serves independence of judiciary.
