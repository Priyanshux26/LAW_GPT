Case Arising From CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 7702 of 2019 From the and dated 26.02.2018 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in CR No.1827 of 2017 Appearances for Parties Pinaki Misra, Sr. Adv., Pravin Bahadur, Ms. Ruby Singh Ahuja, Ms. Kritika Gomber, Ms. Akanksha Thapa, Vishnu Kant, Ms. Uzma Sheikh, M/s. Karanjawala & Co., Advs. for the Appellants. Abhay Mahajan, Shivam Malhotra, Manoranjan Kumar, Advs. for the Respondent. / of the Supreme Court Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J. 1. The issue arising in the present appeal relates to enforcement of an arbitral award expressed in foreign currency. In this context, two questions arise for consideration. First, what is the correct and appropriate date to determine the foreign exchange rate for converting the award amount expressed in foreign currency to Indian rupees. Second, what would be the date of such conversion, when the award debtor deposits some amount before the court during the pendency of proceedings challenging the award. Two uncertainties have a direct bearing on the question to be answered, the time lapse between the date of the award and its enforceability- a local factor, and the ever-fluctuating exchange rates- a global factor. 1.1 Taking into account these two factors and the statutory provisions, coupled with the decisions of this Court, we have formulated twin principles: First, following the principle in Forasol v. Oil and Natural Gas Commission,1 the date when the arbitral 1 [1984] 1 SCR 526 : 1984 Supp SCC 263 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 295 DLF Ltd. (Formerly Known as DLF Universal Ltd) and Anr. v. Koncar Generators and Motors Ltd. award becomes enforceable shall be the date for conversion. Under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 19962 this date is when the objections against the award are dismissed, and award attains finality. Second, in the event that the award amount or part of it is deposited in court pending objections, enabling withdrawal by the decree holder, that date of such deposit shall be the relevant date for conversion as per the principle in Renusagar Power Co Ltd v. General Electric Co.3 Before we consider the submissions of the counsels representing the parties, followed by our reasons and decision, we will refer to the relevant facts of the case.
