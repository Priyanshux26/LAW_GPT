[Paras 20, 21, 70] Limitation Act, 1963 – Objective – s.5 – “sufficient cause”; “within such period” – Law as regards condonation of delay – Discussed. Limitation Act, 1963 – “sufficient cause” – Condonation of delay – Subsequent overruling of a judgement cannot be a sufficient cause for condonation of delay – Exception: Held: Cases pending before this Court will be an exception – If the lis is still pending and has not reached finality, those cases would be decided on the basis of five-judge bench decision in Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal [2020] 3 SCR 1 as a decision on the interpretation of law is applied retrospectively unless the court specifically rules as to its prospective applicability. [Paras 29, 30] s/s – s interpreting law – Applicability: Held: interpreting law is applied retrospectively unless specifically made prospective. [Para 30] Land Acquisition – Limitation – Delay on part of government entities – Condonation of – Government entities, if to be allowed leeway for: Held: The delay cannot be condoned mechanically only because the appellant is a government entity – Government entities must show bona fide and demonstrate diligence in pursuing the matter – The proposition that government entities ought to be afforded greater latitude on issues of delay on account of administrative exigencies, is no longer a precedent to be followed routinely – If delay were to be condoned merely on the basis of a broad general assertion of bureaucratic indifference, without requiring [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1215 Delhi Development Authority v. Tejpal & Ors. demonstration of bona fide or an act of mala fide on the part of specific individuals, it would create an artificial distinction between the private parties and the government entities vis-à-vis the law of limitation which would not be in conformity with the spirit of equality before law as guaranteed under the Constitution – Allowing such latitude would further distort incentives for the government and encourage more laxity by the bureaucracy in its general functioning, thereby undermining quality governance.
