Going by clause 11.2 of GSA, notwithstanding any dispute in relation to any amount invoiced, the respondent could not withhold payment in accordance with the GSA. According to the appellant, the respondent defaulted payment of invoices inasmuch as it made only partial irregular payments from November, F 2011. Meanwhile, the respondent approached BIFR to get it declared as a ‘sick unit’ and for recommendation of a plan for its rehabilitation, in terms of the provisions under SICA. The reference was admitted by BIFR as case No. 13 of 2010 and as per dated 31.08.2010 the respondent was declared as a ‘sick company’. It is the case of the appellant that by virtue of Section 22 of SICA there was a moratorium G on the respondent and therefore, it could not have proceeded against the respondent for outstanding dues, thenceforth, without obtaining the permission of the BIFR. On 07.08.2012 the appellant stopped the gas supply and then, intervened in the pending proceedings before the BIFR viz., 13 of 2010. On 08.03.2013, as per Miscellaneous Application No. H 194 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 432 of 2013 the appellant sought permission of the BIFR for initiating proceedings against the respondent for recovery of an outstanding dues of Rs. 4,71,56,095/-. On 09.09.2015, the BIFR passed an thereon. Shortly thereafter, to be precise, w.e.f. 01.12.2016, SICA was repealed. 5. According to the appellant, BIFR became functus officio and B all proceedings pending before it, including the case of the respondent, were abated and several sections of IBC, including Sections 8 and 9, came into effect on 01.12.2016. Hence, after the enactment of IBC, the appellant issued a demand notice on 01.04.2017, under Section 8 of the IBC read with Rule 5 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application to Adjudicating Authority), Rules 2016, in Form No. 3 demanding payment C of operational debt of Rs. 4,71,56,094.76/-. On 10.04.2017, the respondent gave a reply to the aforesaid demand notice stating that there was shortfall in supply of natural gas and also a huge loss due to the disconnection of gas supply. Raising such contentions, the respondent declined the liability to pay the amount demanded. Thereafter, the appellant filed an application D under Section 9 of the IBC before NCLT, Ahmedabad seeking initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in its capacity as Operational Creditor of the respondent. The said application was dismissed by the NCLT as per dated 27.06.2019 on the grounds of being barred by limitation and existence of a ‘pre-existing dispute’ between the appellant and the respondent. It is the appeal challenging the same E before the NCLAT that ultimately culminated in the impugned . 6. We will firstly consider the first question of law arising on account of dismissal of the appellant’s application under Section 9, IBC on the ground of being barred by limitation. In the light of the aforesaid factual backdrop and contentions the appellant would contend that the F NCLT and NCLAT had failed to look into and appreciate the cumulative effect of sub-sections (1) and (5) of Section 22 of SICA while dismissing the application under Section 9, IBC as barred by limitation.
