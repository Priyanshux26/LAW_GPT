515 Tej Bhan (D) Through Lr. & Ors. v. Ram Kishan (D) Through Lrs. & Ors. maintenance out of an estate, that right could be enforced even against a transferee of the property if the transferee had notice of the right, or if the transfer is gratuitous, but not against a transferee for consideration without notice of the right. Section 28 is in pari materia with Section 39 of the Transfer of Property Act. The Kerala High Court in Kaveri Amma v. Parameswari Amma [AIR 1971 Ker 216 : 1971 KLT 299] has liberally interpreted the expression “right to receive maintenance” occurring in the section as including a right to claim enhanced maintenance against the transferee. The sum and subtotal of the right under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act is only to claim maintenance and the right to receive it even against a transferee. In the absence of any instrument or decree providing for it, no charge for such maintenance is created in the separate properties of the husband. 11. On the wording of the section and in the context of these decisions, it is clear that the ratio in V. Tulasamma v. Shesha Reddy [(1977) 3 SCC 99 : (1977) 3 SCR 261] has application only when a female Hindu is possessed of the property on the date of the Act under semblance of a right, whether it be a limited or a pre-existing right to maintenance in lieu of which she was put in possession of the property. Tulasamma [(1977) 3 SCC 99 : (1977) 3 SCR 261] ratio cannot be applied ignoring the requirement of the female Hindu having to be in possession of the property either directly or constructively as on the date of the Act, though she may acquire a right to it even after the Act. The same is the position in Raghubar Singh v. Gulab Singh [(1998) 6 SCC 314 : AIR 1998 SC 2401] wherein the testamentary succession was before the Act. The widow had obtained possession under a will. A suit was filed challenging the will. The suit was compromised. The compromise sought to restrict the right of the widow. This Court held that since the widow was in possession of the property on the date of the Act under the will as of right and since the compromise decree created no new or independent right in her, Section 14(2) of the Act had no application and Section 14(1) governed the case, her 516 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports right to maintenance being a pre-existing right. In Karmi v. Amru [(1972) 4 SCC 86 : AIR 1971 SC 745] the owner of the property executed a will in respect of a self-acquired property. The testamentary succession opened in favour of the wife in the year 1938. But it restricted her right. Thus, though she was in possession of the property on the date of the Act, this Court held that the life estate given to her under the will cannot become an absolute estate under the provisions of the Act.
