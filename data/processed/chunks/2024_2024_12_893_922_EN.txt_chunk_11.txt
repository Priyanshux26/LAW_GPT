This Note clarified that Chapter 15 would not be applicable to fatty acids, etc., including cosmetic or toilet preparations, which would fall in Section VI. However, the headings in Chapter 15 in Section III of the First Schedule increased to twenty-two after the amendment, with effect from 28.02.2005. Heading 15.03 in the pre-amended Chapter 15 dealt with fixed vegetable oils, excluding those named in Heading 15.02. Coconut oil, not being one of them, was classifiable under Heading 15.03 and there was no issue about it, as was clarified vide Circular dated 31.08.1995. However, post the 2005 amendment, Heading 1513 was created specifically for coconut oil and the other named oils. This heading dealt with crude coconut oil and other forms of coconut oil and its fractions. All that was required thereunder was that the coconut oil should not have been chemically modified. Significantly, the post-2005 amendment description of coconut oil in Heading 1513 was a replication of its description in Heading 15.13 in the HSN. 25. When it comes to Section VI of the First Schedule, pertaining to ‘Products of the Chemical or Allied Industries’, the post-2005 amended Section Note 2 was more or less identical to Section Note 2 in Section VI of the HSN. However, Chapter Note 2 of Chapter 33 in Section VI of the First Schedule, prior to the 2005 amendment, was more detailed than the corresponding Chapter Note 3 in Chapter 33 in 912 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Section VI of the HSN. In the HSN, this Chapter Note stated that Headings 33.03 to 33.07 would apply to products suitable for use as goods of these headings and put up in packings of a kind sold by retail for such use. However, the unamended Chapter Note 2 in Chapter 33 of the First Schedule to the Act of 1985 went further by stating that Headings 33.03 to 33.07 would apply to products suitable for use as goods of these headings and put up in packings with labels, literature or other indications that they are for use as cosmetics or toilet preparations or put up in a form clearly specialized to such use and includes products, whether or not they contain subsidiary pharmaceutical or antiseptic constituents, or are held out as having subsidiary, curative or prophylactic value. There was thus a difference in the Chapter Note in the First Schedule and the corresponding Chapter Note in the HSN. 26. Interestingly, the expanded Chapter Note in the First Schedule was a reflection of what was stated in the General Notes in Chapter 33 of the HSN. Whatever was stated in the expanded Note with regard to the products being ‘put up in packings with labels, literature or other indications that they were for use as cosmetic or toilet preparations or put up in a form clearly specialized to such use and that products, whether or not they contain subsidiary pharmaceutical or antiseptic constituents or are held out as having subsidiary, curative or prophylactic value, would also be included under the headings in question’, is set out in the very same words in the General Notes in Chapter 33 of the HSN.
