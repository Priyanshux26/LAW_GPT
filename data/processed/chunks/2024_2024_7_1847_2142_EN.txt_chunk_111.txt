This is because the question of liability and redress are not addressed by the 1989 Rules. Sri Parekh noted that the CPB reaffirms the precautionary approach, which is also contained in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. Therefore, the decision of GEAC dated 25.10.2022 that tests with regard to the environmental impact of the release would be done post-release and not prior thereto, violates the aforesaid precautionary principle. 17.18 Finally, it was urged that HT seeds of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 have been sown in five locations and in the absence of a proper and lawful approval of the same, the plants should be uprooted and destroyed immediately, so that no environmental contamination takes place. 17.19 Learned senior counsel, Sri Trideep Pais submitted that the procedure adopted by GEAC in the instant case, culminating in the dated 25.10.2022, is not in accordance with law. In this regard, it was submitted that GEAC is a Committee which has been constituted under the 1989 Rules and is therefore, a statutory body. The said body cannot further delegate its functions to sub-committees or Expert Committees. Even if the assistance of such sub-committees or Expert Committees is taken, there has to be detailed deliberations of the recommendations made by the said Expert Committees and not simply accepted without any application of mind as has happened in the instant case. 17.20 It was further submitted that the health expert was consistently absent in all the crucial meetings of GEAC, and thereafter, the said expert sent an e-mail simply concurring with the deliberations of GEAC without any application of mind and in the absence of any participation in the deliberations. Consequently, the health aspect in the context of granting approval for environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 has been totally ignored and kept apart, which 2032 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports is the reason why the petitioners as well as the interveners are pressing for appropriate reliefs on quashing of the decision dated 25.10.2022. In this regard, learned senior counsel drew our attention to the various deliberations of the meetings with reference to the compilation of documents that he submitted. 17.21 Learned senior counsel Sri Pais further submitted that despite the of this Court dated 12.08.2008 and the earlier dated 08.04.2008 stating that the primary data pertaining to field trials must be placed in the public domain and on the website of GEAC, there has been absolute non-compliance of the same and as a result, it is neither in the public domain nor placed on record. 17.22 It was further contended that on the reconstitution of GEAC dated 17.07.2022, one of the members, Dr. Geeta Jotwani, was not present in the meeting held on 18.10.2022. GEAC simply approved the agenda Item No.4 on the said date. As already noted on 02.02.2016 in the 1st meeting of the sub- Committee of GEAC, Dr. B. Sesikeran, the Nutrition and Food Safety expert, was absent. The said expert was continuously absent thereafter on 11.04.2016, 20.06.2016 and 11.08.2016 in the meetings of the sub-committee.
