Digital Supreme Court Reports 08.09.2023 – There is no evidence of any substantive enquiry, inquiry, or investigation made against him prior to coming into operation of s.17A – Appellant cannot be proceeded against for offences under the 1988 Act as no previous approval of the appropriate authority was obtained – Per Bela M. Trivedi, J. s.17A having been introduced as a part of larger legislative scheme, and the other offences under the PC Act having been redefined or newly inserted by way of Amendment Act, 2018, is required to be treated as substantive and not merely procedural in nature – Such a substantive amendment could not be made applicable retrospectively to the offences like ss.13(1)(c) and 13(1)(d) which have been deleted under the Amendment Act, 2018 – Intention of the legislature was to make s.17A applicable only to the new offences as amended by Amendment Act, 2018 and not to the offences which existed prior to the coming into force of the Amendment Act 2018 – In the instant case, the offences u/s.13(1)(c) and (d) were in force when the same were allegedly committed by the appellant – Deletion of the said provisions and the substitution of the new offence u/s.13 by the Amendment Act, 2018 would not affect the right of the investigating agency to investigate nor would vitiate or invalidate any proceedings initiated against the appellant – In view of difference of opinion, matter referred to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for constitution of a Larger Bench.
