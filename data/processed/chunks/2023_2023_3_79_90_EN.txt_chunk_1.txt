Therefore, the observations made by the High Court that the provisions of D Section 45 of the Act, 2002 shall not be applicable in connection with an application under Section 438 Cr.PC is just contrary to the decision in the case of Dr.V.C. Mohan and the same is on misunderstanding of the observations made in the case of Nikesh Tarachand Shah. Once the rigour under Section 45 of the Act, E 2002 shall be applicable the impugned and passed by the High Court granting anticipatory bail to respondent No. 1 is unsustainable. [Paras 5 and 5.1][86-G-H; 87-A-B; 88-B-G] 1.2 Even otherwise on merits also, the impugned and passed by the High Court granting anticipatory bail to F respondent No. 1 is erroneous and unsustainable. While granting the anticipatory bail to respondent No. 1 the High Court has not at all considered the nature of allegations and seriousness of the offences alleged of money laundering and the offence(s) under the Act, 2002. Looking to the nature of allegations, it can be said that the same can be said to be very serious allegations of money G laundering which are required to be investigated thoroughly. In case of economic offences, which are having an impact on the society, the Court must be very slow in exercising the discretion under Section 438 of Cr.PC. [Paras 6 and 6.3][88-G-H; 89-A, H; 90-A] H THE DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENT v. M. GOPAL 81 REDDY & ANR. 1.3 The rigour of Section 45 of the Act, 2002 shall be A applicable even with respect to the application under Section 438 Cr.PC and therefore, the impugned and passed by the High Court granting anticipatory bail to respondent No. 1 is unsustainable.
