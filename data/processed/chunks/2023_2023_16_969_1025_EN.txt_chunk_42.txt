He said: “the clearest way to show what the rule of law means to us in AFJAL ANSARI v. STATE OF UP 1025 [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] everyday life is to recall what has happened when there is no rule of law”. This serves as an important reminder. Adoption of the course charted by Dr. Singhvi that a mere disqualifi cation (without anything more being on record) should be considered as amounting to “irreversible consequences”, would inevitably result in this Court sailing in an unnavigable sea of generalization where, upon disqualifi cation suff ered due to the conviction, a parliamentarian would be entitled to an automatic stay on his conviction without the requisite pleadings. While recognizing the importance of the electorate’s representation, it is necessary to maintain a balance between this right and the enforcement of legal accountability within the democratic framework. 81.
