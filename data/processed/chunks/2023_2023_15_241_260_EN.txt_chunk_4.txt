Given the testimonies of the injured persons and family members of the deceased and the doctors who proved the post-mortem reports, the Trial Court held the prosecution to have proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the cause of death and the persons suff ering injuries (except PW21) were only due to the consumption of spurious liquor mixed with methyl alcohol. ii. There is overwhelming evidence on record that A1 ran an illicit liquor business. iii. Reliance was placed on Ramanarayan Popli v. CBI1 and P.K. Narayanan v. State of Kerala2 to bring home the charge of conspiracy and from the material testimonies of PW23, PW24, PW11 and PW18, it is evident that on 04.04.2003, all three, i.e., A1, A10 and A11, hatched a conspiracy and in furtherance thereof, 21 cans containing methyl alcohol (Biosole) were delivered at the house of A1. Further, on consideration of witnesses,PW25 to 35 and PW76, the Trial Court adduced that it can be safely held that 21 cans of Biosole transported to the house of A1 and 1 (2003) SCC (Crl.) 869 2 (1995) 1 SCC 142 248 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. A3 contained methyl alcohol. It was also observed that A11 was running the fi rm RR Distributors which supplied the methyl alcohol, on behalf of his brother. Reliance was also placed on the forensic examination conducted by PW44 in which it was opined that the 21 cans recovered by PW76 (IO) from the residence of A1, MO15 series and MO31 series (Biosole cans produced by PW27) are cast from the same mould. iv. The recovery of burnt plastic materials from the paramba (lawn) of the house of A11, wherein methyl alcohol was detected, cannot be connected with the occurrence. 9. The High Court observed that the testimony of PW11establishes A10 and A11 having delivered Biosole at the residence of A1 in 21 cans in a maruti car in furtherance of the conspiracy hatched with A1. Also, records of RR Distributors, an enterprise of A11, were falsifi ed by making specifi c entries with an endeavor to conceal the delivery of 21 cans of Biosole to A1. Further, the Court found that on an overall perusal of the materials on record, it cannot be said that there was any serious infi rmity or illegality in the investigation. In view of the above fi ndings, vide the impugned , the conviction and sentence handed down to A10 and A11 were confi rmed. Submissions on behalf of accused persons 10. Learned senior counsel and learned counsel for both these convicts (Appellants) submit that by no stretch of imagination can the act of conspiracy be attributable towards them. 11. Assuming hypothetically, these convicts can be said to have supplied spirit, which is ethanol, as an independent business transaction. Even then, the factum of mixing and illegally selling the end product is not attributable to them,more so, in the absence of any element of conspiracy established beyond a reasonable doubt; hence, there is no question of conviction under the penal laws of the land.
