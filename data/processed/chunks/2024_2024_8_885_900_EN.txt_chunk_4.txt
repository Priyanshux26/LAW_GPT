v Union of India5 (for short “All India Judges(2002))”. 12. Going by the above submissions, the following issues arise for our consideration: A. Can the executive instructions in form of a resolution of the Full Court by prescribing minimum marks for interview, override statutory rules made under Article 234/309? B. Whether the High Court’s decision frustrates the legitimate expectation of the petitioner? Issue A 13. To answer the issue, a reference to the unamended Schedule ‘B’ of MJS Rules 2005 is necessary: “Schedule B to the MJS Rules of 2005 Clause 1: Competitive Examination/Limited Departmental Examination (i) Written examination of 3 papers for 100 marks each (ii) Interview : Viva-voce of 50 marks Clause 3: General Instructions: (i) All candidates who obtained 60% or more marks or corresponding grade in the written examination shall be eligible for viva-voce examination, provided that SC/ST candidates who obtained 50% or more marks or corresponding grade in the written examination shall be eligible for viva-voce examination. (ii) Selection of candidate shall be made on the basis of cumulative grade value obtained in the written and viva-voce examination. 5 [2002] 2 SCR 712 : (2002) 4 SCC 247 892 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (iii) All necessary steps not provided for in these rules for recruitment under these rules shall be decided by the recruiting authority. (iv) Mode of evaluating the performance of Grading in the written and viva-voce examination shall as below: Percentage of Grade Grade Value marks 70% & above O 7 65% to 69% A+ 6 60% to 64% A 5 55% to 59% B+ 4 50% to 54% B 3 45% to 49% C+ 2 40% to 44% C 1 Below 40% F 0 Numerical marks obtained for each question in written examination are to be graded as per the above chart and thereafter all the grade values are to be added up and divided by total number of questions, thereby arriving at a Cumulative Grade value Average (CGVA), which inturn is to be again graded as per the above chart. (v) The same vigorous and objective grade value exercise is also recommended for the viva-voce examination as well. (vi) Final selection list will be readied by combining the cumulative grade value obtained in the written examination and viva-voce examination.” 14. The unamended Schedule ‘B’ of MJS Rules 2005 prescribes the mode of evaluating and grading the performance in the written and viva-voce examination. Those who secured below 40% are classified in the ‘F’ category with zero grade value. However, Sub clause (iv) clearly indicates that the “final selection list will be readied by combining the cumulative grade value obtained in the written examination and viva-voce examination.” [2024] 8 S.C.R. 893 Salam Samarjeet Singh v. The High Court of Manipur at Imphal & Anr 15. Interestingly, the MJS Rules 2005 came to be amended on 09.03.2016, after conclusion of the present recruitment process whereby, 40% minimum qualifying marks in the viva-voce segment were prescribed. This would also indicate that the Rules as unamended, did not have the requirement of minimum 40% in the viva-voce segment and such qualifying marks came to be incorporated only vide Resolution adopted by the Full Court on 12.01.2015.
