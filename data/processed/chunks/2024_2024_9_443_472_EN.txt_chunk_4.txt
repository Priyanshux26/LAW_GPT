This appeal arises from the passed by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla dated 12.07.2022 in Civil Writ Petition No. 2350/2018 filed by the Respondent Nos. 1 to 6 herein (original petitioners) by which the High Court allowed the writ petition and directed the Appellant herein to pay the requisite amount towards compensation as determined in the Supplementary Award dated 02.05.2022 passed by the Land Acquisition Collector, Arki (“LAC”) (Respondent No. 10) in the first instance with liberty to recover the same from M/s Jaiprakash Associates Limited (“JAL”) (Respondent No. 11) if permissible under the legal relationship between the two companies. I. FACTUAL MATRIX 3. The State of Himachal Pradesh (Respondent No. 7) issued a notification dated 25.07.2008 under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (the “1894 Act”) through its Department of Industries declaring its intention to acquire the subject land admeasuring 56-14 bigha, situated at Mauza Bhalag, Tehsil Arki, District Solan, Himachal Pradesh (the “subject land”) in favour of Jaypee Himachal Cement project, a unit of JAL, invoking special powers in cases of urgency as provided under Section 17 of the 1894 Act. It appears that the purpose for acquiring the subject land was to create a safety zone surrounding the mining area. In other words, the subject land was situated in the vicinity of the leasehold area of the mining project and could not have been otherwise used for residential purposes or creation of any other structures. Subsequently notifications were also issued under Sections 6 and 7 respectively of the 1894 Act. 4. It appears from the materials on record that during the acquisition proceedings, some of the landowners, including the Respondent Nos. 450 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 1-6 herein did not allow the authorities to undertake the evaluation of their houses, trees, structures, etc., standing on the subject land for the purpose of determination of compensation. 5. The acquisition proceedings ultimately came to be challenged by some of the landowners before the High Court by way of CWP No. 2949 of 2009 titled as Premlal & Ors. v. State of Himachal Pradesh & Ors. and CWP No. 481 of 2010 titled as Chunni Lal & Ors. v. State of Himachal Pradesh & Ors. inter alia, on the ground that sub-section (4) of Section 17 of the 1894 Act could not have been invoked as the acquisition was not for any public purpose. The High Court passed an ad interim dated 14.12.2011 granting stay on the acquisition proceedings.
