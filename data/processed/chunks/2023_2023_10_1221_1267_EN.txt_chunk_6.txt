C The Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003 no doubt creates a charge in respect of amounts due and payable or arrears. It would be possible to hold [in the absence of a specific enumeration of government dues as in the present case, in Section 53(1)(e)] that the State is to be treated as a ‘secured creditor’. However, the D separate and distinct treatment of amounts payable to secured creditor on the one hand, and dues payable to the government on the other clearly signifies Parliament’s intention to treat the latter differently- and in the present case, having lower priority. This intention is also evident from a reading of the preamble to the Act itself. When an enactment uses two different expressions, E they cannot be construed as having the same meaning.

[2013] 16 SCR 216 – referred to. 1.7 Section 238 of the IBC overrides the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 despite the latter containing two specific provisions which open with non-obstante clauses (i.e., Section G 173 and 174).

Monnet Ispat& Energy Ltd. (2018) 18 SCC 786; Ghanashyam Mishra & Sons (P) Ltd. v. Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd. [2021] 13 SCR 737; Jagmohan Bajaj v. Shivam Fragrances Private Limited 2018 SCC OnLine NCLAT 413 – referred to. B 1.8 Section 78 enacts, that when a company whose property is subject to charge, fails to register it, the charge holder (or the person entitled to the charge over the company’s assets) can seek its registration. Section 3 (31) of the IBC defines “security interest” in the widest terms. In this court’s opinion, the liquidator C cannot urge this aspect at this stage, because of the concurrent findings of the NCLT and the NCLAT that PVVNL is a secured creditor.
