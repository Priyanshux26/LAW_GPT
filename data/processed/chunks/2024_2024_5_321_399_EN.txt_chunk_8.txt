Pertinently, the High Court accepted the contention of the original plaintiff on the issue of interest and granted 24% compound interest on the amounts due. 18. Despite recording the submissions of the parties on the applicability of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act, neither any point for determination was framed nor any finding was returned on the same by the High Court. 19. Aggrieved by the impugned , more particularly as regards the awarding of 24% interest in favour of the original plaintiff – which has inflated the principal decretal amount to one of mammoth proportions – the original defendants are before this Court with the present appeals. B. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS/ ORIGINAL DEFENDANTS 20. Ms. Malvika Trivedi, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendants submitted that the 1985 Act overrides the 1993 Act as the same was enacted in the larger public interest by the Parliament with a view to secure the directive specified under Article 39 of the Constitution. 21. It was further submitted that the 1993 Act having been enacted to provide for and regulate the payment of interest on delayed payments to the small-scale industries, does not envisage a situation where an industrial undertaking becomes sick and requires a scheme for its revival. 22. It was argued that the provisions of the 1985 Act should be given the widest possible import in light of the fact that the same is a self- contained code containing provisions like the statutory bar on civil suits for recovery of money from sick industrial companies under Section 22 and the non-obstante clause under Section 32 by virtue of which the provisions of the 1985 Act are given an overriding effect. Reliance was placed by the learned senior counsel upon the decisions of this Court in Jay Engineering Works Ltd. v. Industry Facilitation Council reported in (2006) 8 SCC 677 and Tata Motors Ltd. v. Pharmaceutical Products of India Ltd. reported in (2008) 7 SCC 619. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 335 Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v. M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited 23. It was further submitted that the impugned and passed by the High Court failed to take into consideration the law settled by this Court in Bhoruka Textiles Ltd. v. Kashmiri Rice Industries reported in (2009) 7 SCC 521 which held that if the jurisdiction of the civil court was ousted in terms of the jurisdictional bar imposed under Section 22 of the 1985 Act, then any rendered by it would be coram non-judice and as a result a nullity. 24. To fortify her aforesaid submission, the learned senior counsel argued that the facts of the present case are similar to the facts in Bhoruka Textiles (supra) as follows: I. The defendant company was declared as a sick industrial undertaking under Section 3(1)(o) of the 1985 Act and was referred to the BIFR for its revival on 06.11.1992 and an enquiry under Section(s) 16 and 17 respectively of the 1985 Act was pending in respect of the defendant company at the time of the institution of the suit by the original plaintiff before the trial court.
