187 and the area of the said plot must have been within the knowledge of all concerned as on the dates of the resolutions, given the statutory scheme of transparency. 33. Further, though so much stress was laid by the plaintiffs upon the resolutions passed by the authorities in the year 1986 to contend that the ‘same area’ was to be allotted to them in lieu of Plot No. 463, we may note that this mistaken impression, if at all entertained by the plaintiffs, despite the clear mention of Final Plot No. 187 in those resolutions and their own knowledge of the details of the scheme, stood dispelled in April, 1995. They were parties to the public interest litigation initiated in Special Civil Application No. 3980 of 1992 before a Division Bench of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad. The challenge therein was to the allotment of Final Plot No. 187 to them [2024] 6 S.C.R. 619 Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation on the ground that the said plot was meant for a public purpose. The plaintiffs were respondent Nos. 4 and 5 in Special Civil Application No. 3980 of 1992. In the rendered therein on 03/04.04.1995, the Division Bench observed that Final Plot No. 187 was to be given to the plaintiffs instead of Final Plot No. 463 which was larger. The Division Bench further observed that it was they who appeared to have lost in the bargain, because the plot of land which was now being offered to them, viz., Plot No. 187, was nearly 1200 sq. yds. lesser than Plot No. 463 and the only advantage which they got was that Plot No. 187 was free from encumbrance. Nearly nine months later, Final Plot No. 187 was actually delivered to the plaintiffs. However, in the interregnum, they raised no objection or grievance as to the reduction in the plot size and quietly waited for delivery of Final Plot No. 187. It is also an admitted fact that, shortly thereafter, in the year 1998, the plaintiffs sold the said plot to J.K. Cooperative Housing Society Limited. 34. The failure of the Corporation in handing over vacant possession of Plot No. 463 was also subjected to attack, but we find that when the said allotment was modified by the second variation of Town Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi, in the year 1986, whereby the plaintiffs were allotted Final Plot No. 187 which was of a lesser area, they silently accepted the same and did not choose to either seek implementation of the original scheme, whereunder they were allotted a larger plot, or challenge the varied scheme, whereby they were given a smaller plot. Having accepted the plot allotted to them upon variation of the scheme without demur or protest, the plaintiffs cannot now seek to reopen the negligence and delay, if any, on the part of the Corporation prior to such variation. Further, as is evident from the edicts laid down by this Court, referred to supra, upon the preparation or variation of a Town Planning Scheme, the rights in the earlier plots of land would stand extinguished.
