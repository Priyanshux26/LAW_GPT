Digital Supreme Court Reports Committee to Mr. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. The Search Committee had not carried out the shortlisting exercise by then. 7. The Search Committee, in its meeting on 13.03.2024, could not finalise and shortlist the names. In the meeting held on 14.03.2024, the Search Committee recommended a panel of six names for consideration of the Selection Committee, which were then circulated and forwarded to the members of the Selection Committee, including Mr. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. 8.

It is also observed that the Court is neither invited, nor if invited, would issue a mandamus to the legislature to make a law. We would also add that the Court would not ‘invite’ the legislature to make a law in a particular manner. However, the Constitutional Court within the framework of the Constitution exercises the power of judicial review and can invalidate a law when it is violative of the Fundamental Rights, on application of the principle of proportionality, etc. 10.
