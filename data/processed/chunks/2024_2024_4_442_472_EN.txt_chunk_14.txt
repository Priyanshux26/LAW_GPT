(2) Where an officer takes down any information in writing under sub-section (1) or records grounds for his belief under the proviso thereto, he shall within seventy-two hours send a copy thereof to his immediate official superior.” 31. From the perusal of provision of Section 42(1) of the NDPS Act 1985, it is evident that the provision obligates an officer empowered by virtue of Section 41(2) of the NDPS Act 1985 to record the information received from any person regarding an alleged offence under Chapter IV of the NDPS Act 1985 or record the grounds of his belief as per the Proviso to Section 42(1) of the NDPS Act 1985 462 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in case an empowered officer proceeds on his personal knowledge. While the same is to be conveyed to the immediate official superior prior to the said search or raid, in case of any inability to do so, the Section 42(2) of the NDPS Act provides that a copy of the same shall be sent to the concerned immediate official superior along with grounds of his belief as per the proviso hereto. This relaxation contemplated by virtue of Section 42(2) of the NDPS Act 1985 was brought about through the Amendment Act of 2001 to the NDPS Act of 1985 wherein prior to this position, the Section 42(2) mandated the copy of the said writing to be sent to the immediate official superior “forthwith”. 32.

However, any delay in the said compliance may be allowed considering the same is supported by well-reasoned explanations for such delay. This position adopted by the instant 5-Judges’ Bench of this Court is derived from the ratio in the decision in Balbir Singh (supra) which is a decision by a 3-Judges’ Bench of this Court. 33. Another 3-Judges’ Bench while dealing with compliance of Section 42 of the NDPS Act 1985 in Chhunna alias Mehtab v. State of Madhya Pradesh (2002) 9 SCC 363 dealt with criminal trial wherein there was an explicit non-compliance of the statutory requirements under the NDPS Act 1985. It was held that the trial of the Petitioner- Appellant therein stood vitiated. For a better reference, the is quoted below as: “1. The case of the prosecution was that at 3.00 a.m. a police party saw opium being prepared inside a room and they entered the premises and apprehended the accused who was stated to be making opium and mixing it with chocolate. 2. It is not in dispute that the entry in search of the premises in question took place between sunset and sunrise at 3.00 a.m. This being the position, the proviso to Section 42 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was applicable and it is admitted that before the entry for [2024] 4 S.C.R.
