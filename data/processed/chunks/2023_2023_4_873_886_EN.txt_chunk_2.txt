[Para 15.2][884-E-F] F 3.2. Even if the requirements of Section 17 of the Act of 1887 are held to be mandatory, the present one had not been a case where the defendant had altogether ignored those requirements. [Para 15.3][884-G-H] G 3.3. In response to the queries of this Court, the appellants immediately took bonafide steps and deposited the amount which may be relatable to rent/mesne profits until the month of April, 2023. For this bonafide and prompt step (albeit taken after H 876 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A approaching this Court), they do deserve an opportunity to contest the suit on merits, particularly when the matter relates to a shop where the predecessor of the appellants had been continuing as tenant and the plaintiff-respondent is seeking the decree for eviction only on the ground of default in payment of rent. [Para 16][885-C-D] B 4. Accordingly, the application filed by the appellants under IX Rule 13 CPC is allowed and thereby, the ex parte and decree are set aside. Consequently, the said suit shall stand restored for being considered on its own merits. [Para 17][885-E] C Kedarnath v.
