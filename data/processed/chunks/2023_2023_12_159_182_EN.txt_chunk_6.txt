11. The appellant fi led additional affi davit along with a valuation report dated 16.07.2013 showing the current market value of land as in the year 2013 as Rs. 3,93,45,696/-. In view of the inordinate delay in passing of award from the date of notifi cation and taking over of possession, prayer is made to mould the relief in exercise of the powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. 12. After having heard learned counsel for the parties and in the facts of the case, in our view, the following questions arise for consideration: i) Whether the impugned of the High Court negating the plea of appellant seeking ‘lapse’ of the acquisition proceedings in terms of Section 11-A of LA Act is liable to be interfered with? ii) Whether decision of NIT refusing to grant alternative plot, as directed by the High Court, requires interference in this appeal? iii) Whether in the peculiar facts of the case, delay caused in determination of compensation despite time bound directions by the High Court, what suitable relief can be granted to appellant? IN REFERENCE TO QUESTION NO. 1 13. It is not in dispute that the notifi cation was issued under Section 39 of the NIT Act on 12.07.1962. Although the said notifi cation is not on record, but looking at the material brought, it is clear that the land of Khasra No. 35/1 and 35/2 only, without mentioning Khasra No. 35/8 in the said notifi cation was proposed for acquisition. The fi nal notifi cation was issued with same details. The possession of Khasra No. 35/8 was taken in the year 1970 and the road was constructed on 5390 sq. ft. utilising the entire land of 9800 sq. ft of the said Khasra. It is relevant to note that vide Act of 68 of 1984, amendment in the LA Act was introduced adding Section 11-A, whereby passing an award determining the compensation within period of 168 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. two years was made necessary. In case the award has not been passed within the specifi ed period, it shall result in lapsing of acquisition proceedings. In the present case, the acquisition was under the State Act, i.e., NIT Act with the aid of LA Act, however, it’s applicability in such acquisition requires consideration. 14. The said issue of applicability of Section 11-A of the LA Act in an acquisition proceeding carried under NIT Act has been decided by this Court in the case of “Nagpur Improvement Trust Vs. Vasantrao and Others, (2002) 7 SCC 657”, wherein it was clarifi ed that the subsequent amendment made by Act No. 68 of 1984 will have no eff ect on the acquisition made under the State Act, which means the lapsing provision under Section 11-A introduced by Act of 68 of 1984, does not apply to acquisition of land by Nagpur Improvement Trust under NIT Act. The same principle has been reiterated in “Bankatlal Vs. Special Land Acquisition Offi cer and Another, (2014) 15 SCC 116”, wherein it was held that the NIT Act is a complete code in itself, except to apply the provisions of the LA Act that stood legislatively incorporated in the said Act, and other provisions would not apply.
