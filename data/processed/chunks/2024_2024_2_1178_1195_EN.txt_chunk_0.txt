[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1178 : 2024 INSC 198 Thakore Umedsing Nathusing v. State of Gujarat (Criminal Appeal No. 250 of 2016) 22 February 2024 [B.R. Gavai and Sandeep Mehta,* JJ.] Issue for Consideration Scope of interference by High Court in an appeal challenging acquittal of the accused by the trial Court; standard of proof required to bring home charges in a case based purely on circumstantial evidence. Headnotes Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.378(1)(b) – Appeal in case of acquittal – Interference by High Court – Scope – Prosecution’s case that the accused persons took the jeep of the victim-deceased on hire and thereafter they murdered the victim and looted the jeep – Appellants-accused were convicted and sentenced for offence punishable u/s.392, IPC however, were acquitted u/s.302 r/w s.34 and ss.396 and 397, IPC – High Court reversed the acquittal and convicted them for offences punishable u/ss.302, 396, IPC and sentenced accordingly – Correctness: Held: No direct evidence was led to bring home the charges against the accused and the entire case of prosecution was based on circumstantial evidence – Prosecution miserably failed to lead reliable, tangible and convincing links forming a complete chain of incriminating circumstances so as to bring home the guilt of the accused for the charge of murder punishable u/s.302 – Further, while reversing the acquittal of the accused recorded by the trial Court for the charges u/s.302 r/w s.34 and ss.396, 397, the High Court did not record any such finding that the view taken by the trial Court based on appreciation of evidence was either perverse or it was not one of the permissible views favouring the acquittal of the accused – Thus, the impugned falls short of the satisfaction mandatorily required to be recorded for reversing a of acquittal and converting it to one of conviction – * Author [2024] 2 S.C.R. 1179 Thakore Umedsing Nathusing v.
