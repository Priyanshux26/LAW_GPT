Notably, Section 29 of the Indian Police Act, 1861, makes willful breach of regulations by a policeman and causing of unwarrantable personal violence to any person in his custody, punishable with fine or imprisonment. Further, Police Manuals invariably hold those in charge of police stations responsible for the safe custody of all the prisoners housed therein. 20. Deepak Lokhande (PW-8) allegedly impersonated Shama on 24.12.1995 and staged a performance to support the police version that Shama had escaped from their custody on that night. Neither this parody nor the record of Shama suffering conviction before the Railway Court at Raipur can be allowed to dupe this Court, as intended by the guileful appellants. The appellants have been let off rather lightly by convicting them only under Section 304 Part-II IPC. Their careless disregard for the value of human life warranted a much more stringent punishment being visited upon them. In such circumstances, giving in to their duplicitous stories and permitting them to escape punishment would only add insult to injury. 7 Mohammed Ghouse, “State lawlessness and Constitution of India: A study of custodial deaths”, Comparative Constitutional Law 270 (Mahendra P.

I would, therefore, respectfully disagree with the conclusion drawn by my learned brother that, in the absence of evidence regarding the homicidal death of Shama @ Kalya, the appellants are entitled to be acquitted of the charge under Section 304 Part-II IPC read with Section 34 IPC, by granting them the benefit of doubt. On the contrary, I would maintain the convictions and sentences of the appellants, as confirmed by the High Court, and dismiss all the appeals. Result of the Case: In view of the divergent of opinion, the appeal papers directed to be placed before the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India for assigning the same to the appropriate Bench. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
