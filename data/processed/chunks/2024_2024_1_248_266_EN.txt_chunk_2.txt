Case of the Prosecution: 2. The facts can be summed up in brief as follows: The deceased, Amrik Kaur was married to Darshan Singh, the appellant, some time in 1988. The marriage was arranged through Melo Kaur (PW-3), the cousin sister of the deceased. The prosecution alleges that their marital relationship was strained owing largely to the fact that Darshan Singh had developed an illicit partnership with Rani Kaur (A2). Several relatives had prevailed on the appellant to put an end to his relationship with Rani Kaur, but to no avail. The illicit relationship between Darshan Singh and Rani Kaur is said to have lasted for at least three years before the fateful day. It is the case of the prosecution that on the intervening night of 18.05.1999 and 19.05.1999, Darshan Singh and Rani Kaur, with the motive of eliminating the deceased, administered poison and intentionally caused the death of Amrik Kaur. 3. On these allegations, Darshan Singh and Rani Kaur were prosecuted for charges under Section 302 r/w Section 34 IPC. The Trial Court convicted both the accused persons for the offence under Section 302 r/w Section 34 and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life. 252 [2024] 1 S.C.R. DIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS Findings of the Trial Court and High Court: 4. The Trial Court has concluded that it was a case of homicide and not suicide. It has found that the appellant had a strong motive to commit the murder of his wife. It further held that the appellant and Rani Kaur were present in the house on the intervening night of 18.05.1999 and 19.05.1999 and therefore, the burden lay on them to explain as to ‘how the body of Amrik Kaur who was alive on the night of 18.05.1999 turned into a corpse’ the next morning. The Court has completely disbelieved the theory of suicide sought to be advanced on behalf of appellant. It was noted that merely because there were no injuries on the body of the deceased, that by itself would not obviate the possibility of forceful administration of the poisonous substance. On the basis of the above circumstances taken together, the Trial Court held that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant and Rani Kaur. 5. In appeal, the High Court has agreed with the findings of the Trial Court in so far as the appellant is concerned and has acquitted Rani Kaur by extending her the benefit of doubt. It has found that there is no other evidence except the testimony of PW3 and PW4, to prove the presence of Rani Kaur on the intervening night of 18.05.1999 and 19.05.1999 at the appellant’s house. ARGUMENTS OF MR. ABHIMANYU TEWARI, COUNSEL APPEARING FOR APPELLANT: 6. PW3, Melo Kaur, is not a reliable witness. The presence of the appellant, Darshan Singh, at the house on the intervening night of 18.05.1999 and 19.05.1999 is sought to be established based on her testimony. She has made several improvements in her version, and her testimony suffers from several contradictions, and therefore, it is not safe to rely on such a witnesses’ uncorroborated testimony.
