Submissions on behalf of Appellants 15. Ms. Kaveeta Wadia, who led the arguments on behalf of the appellants in appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos. 730 of 2022, 729 of 2022 and 9977 of 2022, inter alia, submitted: (i) The fi rst and second advertisements (i.e., dated 13.02.2015 and 18.10.2016) were issued during currency of the 2014 Rules. The 2014 Rules prescribed eligibility qualifi cations in unequivocal terms and the advertisements specifi ed the same qualifi cations with a clear stipulation that candidates applying thereunder must hold the requisite qualifi cations by the last date for receipt of the application. The last date for receipt of application under the fi rst advertisement was 31.10.2015, and under the second advertisement it was 17.11.2016. Both the advertisements did not reserve the power to relax the eligibility criteria at any later stage. In these circumstances, the relaxation accorded on 21.08.2017, after the last date for receipt of the applications, was illegal. (ii) The High Court erred in observing that relaxation was necessitated because, (a) there could be confusion as to the true import of the ANKITA THAKUR & ORS. v. THE H.P. STAFF SELECTION 835 COMMISSION & ORS. [MANOJ MISRA, J.] expression “recognized University / Institution” and (b) there could be institutions conducting the same course under a diff erent nomenclature.
