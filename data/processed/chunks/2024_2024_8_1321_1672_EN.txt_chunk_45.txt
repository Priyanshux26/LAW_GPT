It was held that if this basis of classification was accepted as valid, it would create an artificial distinction between two persons who retired within forty-eight hours of each other. Writing 129 See NM Thomas [Justice Mathew, 83] 130 [1980] 3 SCR 139 : (1980) 3 SCC 245 131 [1980] 1 SCR 1036 : (1980) 1 SCC 634 132 (1983) 1 SCC 305 133 ibid [48] [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1383 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. for the Bench, Justice D A Desai held that this Court while deciding if sub-classification is permissible must determine if the class is homogenous for the purpose of the law.134 87. Nakara (supra) goes a step further than Triloki Nath (supra) to state that the scope of sub-classification does not hinge on the yardstick which is used to integrate groups into a class but on the issue of whether the class is homogenous or integrated for the specific objective of the law. When a law integrates a class, such as diploma and degree holders, it integrates the class for the purpose of that specific law and not for all purposes. Thus, a class which is not similarly situated for the purpose of the law can be further classified. The test that the Court must follow to determine the validity of the sub-classification of a class is as follows: a. Whether the class is “homogenous” or “similarly situated” for the purpose of the specific law; b. If the answer to ‘a’ above is in the affirmative, the class cannot be sub-classified; c. If the answer to ‘a’ above is in the negative, the class can be sub-classified upon the fulfilment of the following standard: i. There must be a yardstick (or intelligible differentia) further classifying the class; and ii. The yardstick must have a rational nexus with the object of the statute. c. Micro-classification: the limits of sub-classification 88. The next issue which arises is whether there are any limits to sub- classification. In numerous s, this Court has held that the State must not micro-classify since such classifications would denude (rather than promote) the guarantee of equality, replacing the doctrine of equality with the doctrine of classification.135 When does sub-classification take the properties of micro-classification? 134 DS Nakara (supra) [Desai J,42] : “If it appears to be undisputable, as it does to us that the pensioners for the purpose of pension benefits form a class, would its upward revision permit a homogenous class to be divided by arbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria unrelated to purpose of revision and would such classification be founded on some rational principle?” 135 Mohammad Shujat Ali and Others v. Union of India (1975) 3 SCC 76 [Justice Bhagwati, 24-26] 1384 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 89. In Nakara (supra), this Court incidentally illustrated what could be termed as a microscopic classification. This Court observed that if each pensioner were to be classified based on their individual dates of retirement or the month of their retirement, it would be too microscopic a classification.
