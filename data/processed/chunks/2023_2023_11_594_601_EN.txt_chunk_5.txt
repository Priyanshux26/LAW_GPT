Since the market value of the lands as on 17.12.1994 which was the reckonable date agreed by the parties, was required to be determined by the District Court, Nashik, making of an application to the Collector seeking a Reference under Section 18 was a sheer procedural formality required to be followed by the appellant. Though the consent terms and the directions of High Court were silent as to within what period the appellant had to make such an application, it was required to be construed that appellant had to make application after it received the compensation awarded under Section 11 and after it handed over possession of the lands, which it did. 8. It cannot be gainsaid that as per the rules of doctrine of harmonious construction, the document has to be read as a whole and in its totality. If there is any ambiguity either patent or latent, in any of the clauses of the document, the courts should interpret such clause in such manner which is consistent with the other clauses and with the purpose and intent of the parties executing it. 9. The Reference Court after considering all the legal and factual aspects of the matter had rightly held that the Reference was fi led with the Collector within the period of limitation as per the passed by the High Court. In our opinion, the High Court had committed gross error in interfering with the said well-reasoned fi ndings recorded by the Reference Court, and in setting aside the entire award and remanding the matter back to the Reference Court for deciding it afresh. The impugned s and s passed by the High Court being ex facie erroneous, the same are set aside. 10. In that view of the matter, both the appeals are allowed. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals allowed.
