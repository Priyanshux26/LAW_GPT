It is submitted that neither the FIR nor the charge-sheet contain a whisper with respect to any inducement, fraud or dishonesty qua the appellant that caused the complainant to deliver the sum of Rs.20,00,000/- to his bank account on 2nd February 2017. 7. Shri Nagamuthu further submitted that the complainant has deliberately suppressed the fact that the appellant had transferred the land in favour of accused No. 1 by way of a Sale Deed dated 3rd February 2017 i.e., on the very next day of receiving the sum of Rs.20,00,000/- from the complainant. It is further submitted that, on the very same day i.e. 3rd February 2017, accused No. 1 had executed a GPA in favour of the complainant vide Document No. 3733 of 2017. The GPA specifically states that the complainant had received the GPA in respect of the land purchased by accused No. 1 from the appellant. It is therefore submitted that the appellant has no role to play after 3rd February 2017 and almost all the allegations are with regard to cancellation of GPA etc., and execution of subsequent sale deed in favour of accused No. 4-Seeralan and accused No. 5-Kavitha by accused No. 1, are not related to the appellant. 8. As against this, Shri G. Ananda Selvam, learned counsel appearing for respondent No. 2 submits that since the charge-sheet has already been filed, the appeal is rendered infructuous. It is submitted that the appellant can very well file an application for discharge. It is further submitted that the averments in the FIR would clearly show that the present appellant along with other accused persons has cheated the complainant and defrauded with the huge amount. It is therefore submitted that no interference is warranted in the present appeal. CONSIDERATION 9.
