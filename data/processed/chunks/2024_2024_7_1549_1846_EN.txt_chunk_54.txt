[…]” 49. In a federal form of government, each federal unit should be able to perform its core constitutional functions with a certain degree of independence. The Constitution has to be interpreted in a manner which does not dilute the federal character of our constitutional scheme.55 The effort of the constitutional court should be to ensure that State legislatures are not subordinated to the Union in the areas exclusively reserved for them.56 50. In Union of India v. Mohit Minerals Private Limited,57 this Court recognized fiscal federalism as an important attribute of Indian federalism. Fiscal federalism is concerned with the assignment of functions to different levels of government and devolution of appropriate fiscal instruments to carry out these functions.58 In India, these fiscal instruments typically take the form of tax and debt instruments. Similar to the division of constitutional powers and responsibilities, the Constitution has also shared tax-raising responsibilities between the Union and the States.59 53 In re, Special Reference No. 1 of 1964 [1965] 1 SCR 413; Jindal Stainless Steel (supra) [612] 54 [1994] 2 SCR 644 : (1994) 3 SCC 1 55 Jindal Stainless Steel (supra) [85]. 56 Jindal Stainless Steel (supra) [615]. 57 [2022] 9 SCR 300 : (2022) 10 SCC 700 [56] 58 Wallace E Oates, ‘An Essay on Fiscal Federalism’ (1999) 37(3) Journal of Economic Literature 1120, 1121. 59 The legislative power of Parliament to tax is enumerated in entries 82 to 92B of List I.

The Constitution is cognizant of the imbalance between resources at the disposal of states and the Union. The Constitution remedies the imbalance by way of intergovernmental distribution60 and grants.61 One of basic features of fiscal federalism is that both the Union government and the State governments ought to have adequate fiscal resources to discharge their constitutional responsibilities. List I and List II of the Seventh Schedule contain various subject-matters under which Parliament and the State legislatures can respectively levy taxes. The purpose of such a distribution is to entrust adequate fiscal powers with the legislatures to raise revenues to meet the growing fiscal expenditures and rein in the fiscal deficit. The legislatures can formulate the principles underlying any taxing legislation, define the taxing event or the charge of tax as well the mode and manner of its implementation. 52. The subjects in respect of which the framers of the Constitution desired that there should be uniformity of law throughout the country have been enumerated under the Union List, while matters which may require laws to be made having regard to the particular needs and peculiar problems of each State have been placed under the State List.62 For instance, the State legislatures can tax the consumption or sale of electricity. Although electricity is an important raw material for many industries, the States are allowed to determine the rates of the levy by taking into consideration the particular needs of the State.
