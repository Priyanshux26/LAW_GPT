It is very well settled position of law that the persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were and are treated as a separate category, and the principle of “creamy layer” does D not apply to the said categories. It applies only to the persons belonging to the socially and the economically backward classes. Ergo, the date of issuance of certificate to the persons belonging to OBC-NCL/MBC-NCL/EWS categories assumes significance for the purpose of ascertaining as to whether the candidate E claiming to belong to a particular reserved category on the date when he/she applied for the post in question under such category, in fact belonged to the said category on the date on which such application was made or on the date prescribed in the advertisement. [Para 14][625-D-G] F 2. Having regard to the said instructions contained in the said advertisement dated 22.07.2021, there remains no shadow of doubt that if a candidate had applied under any of the reserved categories, he or she was expected to have a valid certificate issued by the competent authority as per rules in the prescribed format, to show his or her eligibility to apply under such category. G The time limit for making such application as stated in Clause 17 of the said advertisement was upto 5 PM on 31.08.2021. Under the circumstances, the candidate was expected to have the H 588 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A requisite certificate to show that he or she belonged to the concerned reserved category, on the date of making application or on the last date fixed for the submission of applications i.e. 31.08.2021. Such certificate to be produced by the concerned candidate had to be a valid certificate issued by the competent authority in consonance with the circulars issued by the State B Government dated 09.09.2015 and as clarified in the Circular dated 08.08.2019, which governed the issue with regard to the validity of such certificates. [Para 22][630-C-E] 3. All the appellants had produced their respective certificates which were obtained by them after the last date fixed C for the submission of the application i.e., 31.08.2021, and had also not produced the documents/affidavits in support thereof, in compliance with the circulars dated 09.09.2015 and 08.08.2019. Therefore, the certificates produced by the appellants at the time of interview could not said to be valid certificates as mandated in D the advertisement dated 22.07.2021 by the respondents. [Para 23][630-H; 631-A] 4. It was sought to be submitted by counsel for the appellants that there was no specific date mentioned in the advertisement dated 22.07.2021 as to the validity period of the E certificates to be furnished by the appellants, and subsequent notice dated 04.08.2022 directing the appellants to produce the certificates as mentioned therein was highly unreasonable, and tantamount to changing the rules of game after the process of selection had started. The Court does not find any substance in the said argument. As stated earlier, there were specific F instructions given in the advertisement that the candidates applying under the reserved categories had to submit the valid certificates issued by the competent authority, and therefore such certificates had to be in consonance with the circulars of the State Government dated 09.09.2015 and 08.08.2019 which governed G the validity period of such certificates.
