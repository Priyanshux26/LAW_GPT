We, therefore, do not find any substance in the petition.” The appellants’ contentions 7. Mr. Jay Salva, learned counsel for the appellants argued that the last pay revision was made applicable to MSFC’s employees from H 1178 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 01.01.1986, which expired on 31.12.1989, and MSFC considered pay revision to be made effective from 01.01.1990. Its proposal for pay revision was submitted to the State Government by the Board of Directors of MSFC. The revision of pay and emoluments was approved by MSFC’s Board of Directors, and it was forwarded to the State of Maharashtra for final approval in the year 1996. Pending approval of the said revision, B further five revisions were kept due. Instead of considering those revisions, the MSFC’s Board of Directors arbitrarily implemented the pay commission’s recommendations w.e.f. 01.01.1996. The benefits of revised pay were passed on to the existing 115 employees working at the relevant time only, and deprived 900 ex-employees of similar benefits, C though the revision was applicable to them for the period of their service time span, respectively. 8. It was submitted that the cut-off date, for granting benefits of the pay revision, is arbitrary, because several employees had retired, after long years of loyal service. They would be deprived of the benefit D of any pay revision, merely because the MSFC chose to implement the decision on a particular date, after their retirement. 9. It was also urged that the State and the MSFC cannot discriminate between persons who worked during the same period, and discharged their duties in accordance to its mandate, merely because some of them had retired. Thus, the fixation of date, in this case, is E arbitrary as it deprives the benefit of pay revision - which is otherwise made applicable to all employees who worked during a particular period - to those who ceased to be in employment, despite working in the said period. It was submitted that those who worked for the period 2000- 2005 are in the same class of employees, who worked after the so called F cut-off date, i.e., 01.01.2006. 10. It was submitted that all those in employment, including those who were finally deprived of the pay revision on account of retirement, were granted three interim reliefs by the MSFC from September, 1993 onwards (on 03.03.1994, 29.04.1996, and 07.09.1996) towards the G recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission, in line with directions of the Maharashtra government. 11. It was further argued that no recoveries were made (under the impugned GR dated 29.03.2010) of the amount paid towards interim relief and ad hoc amount paid to existing employees from September, H MAHARASHTRA STATE FINANCIAL CORP. EX- EMPLOYEES 1179 ASSOC. v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 1993 to July, 2001 which shows that the Fifth Pay Commission’s A recommendations were implemented from 01.01.1996. 12. Mr. Salva further submitted that the total liability of the MSFC is not more than ` 32 crores, in respect of past employees, including those who had retired, sought VRS, or had died before the pay revision was made effective.
