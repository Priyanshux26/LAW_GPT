Therefore, the bar of jurisdiction of Civil Court imposed by Section 37 is not applicable to the present suit which is a simpliciter for declaration of his rights over the suit land on the basis of the of the Consolidation Court. 24. In view of the facts and circumstances, even though there was no necessity on the part of the plaintiff-appellant to have instituted any civil suit for declaration of his rights over the suit land inasmuch as his rights over the same stood determined by the Consolidation Court vide dated 12.11.1979, nonetheless, a suit as filed by him is not barred by Section 37 of the Consolidation Act, as it does not propose to challenge any passed by the Consolidation Court under the Consolidation Act. 25. Thus, our answer to the question framed in paragraph 12 above is that a civil suit for declaration of rights in respect of land where the Consolidation Court has already passed an recognizing the rights of one of the parties is not barred by Section 37 of the Consolidation Act and that the Civil Court is not competent to either ignore or reverse the passed by the Consolidation Officer once it has attained finality. 26.

Consequently, the suit of the plaintiff-appellant stands decreed. 27. The appeal is allowed with no as to cost. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeal allowed.
