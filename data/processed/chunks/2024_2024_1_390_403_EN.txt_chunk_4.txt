In 2012, when the petition8 was filed seeking amalgamation of Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech with BDR, the Delhi High Court, as per requirements, had issued notice to all the shareholders of the two companies on 09.07.2012. No objection was raised by the complainant or the company at that stage. On 20.02.2013, the scheme of amalgamation was approved by the Delhi High Court in terms of which the company became entitled to 3,74,280 shares of BDR. On 08.03.2013, a letter was written by Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech to the complainant to surrender original share certificates of Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech to facilitate issuance of new certificates. 12. Nearly one year after the amalgamation, on 31.01.2014, DD Global Capital Limited, the company of the complainant filed an application9 before the Delhi High Court seeking recall of the of amalgamation passed by the High Court as it was without any notice to the company. Other grounds were also raised in this application for recalling the of amalgamation. The aforesaid application was dismissed by the High Court on 15.03.2016 by a detailed 8 Company Petition No.287 of 2012 9 Company Application No.321 of 2014 [2024] 1 S.C.R. 397 Dinesh Gupta v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. dealing with all the issues raised. The attained finality as the company did not challenge the same any further. In the aforesaid proceedings, a letter dated 08.10.2014, allegedly written by Sushil Gupta, one of the accused (not before this Court), claiming that the shares of the company with Verma Buildtech were pledged to him, was also placed on record. This issue was also dealt with by the High Court. 13. More than two years after the application filed by the company was dismissed by Delhi High Court, the instant complaint was filed with the police at Gautam Budh Nagar, on the basis of which FIR in question was registered on 29.07.2018. 14. It is the appellants’ submission that a purely civil dispute with reference to financial transactions between corporates is sought to be given colour of a criminal case. Though the company does not have any connection whatsoever with Gautam Budh Nagar and all the transactions were held at New Delhi between the parties, which are based in New Delhi, yet the complaint was filed at Gautam Budh Nagar. Even the address of the complainant given in the complaint is ‘C/o A & A Earth Movers, D-9, Sector-2, Noida Sector-20, Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P.’ which neither belongs to the complainant nor his company. The aforesaid facts clearly establish that the idea was only to harass the appellants. 15. In fact, the dispute amongst the parties has already been referred to Arbitration by the Delhi High Court vide dated 15.05.2019 and the company has already filed its claim before the sole Arbitrator. 16.
