363 Manisha Mahendra Gala & Ors. v. Shalini Bhagwan Avatramani & Ors. being land Survey No.57 Hissa No.13A/2. The balance land which was essentially a part of Survey No.57 was sold to the family of Ramani’s by a registered Sale Deed dated 11.09.1989 and was numbered as Survey No. 57 Hissa No. 13A/1. 8. In this way, the entire property of the Borkar family comprising of Survey No.48 Hissa No.15 and Survey No.57 Hissa No.13 which was acquired by the government came into the hands of Woler Francis (Survey No.48 Hissa No.15); the family of Ramani’s (Survey No.57 Hissa No.13A/1); and the family of Dharmadhikari (Survey No.57 Hissa No.13A/2). 9. The road in dispute on which easementary rights are claimed by the Gala’s forms part of Survey No.57 Hissa No.13A/1 which is under the ownership of the Ramani’s. 10. Sometime in 1994, Woler Francis died and he was succeeded by his heir and legal representative Joki Woler Ruzer. When his use of the above 20ft. wide road was objected to by the Ramani’s, he filed Suit No.14 of 1994 for declaration of his easementary rights over the said land and for a decree of permanent injunction. During the pendency of the said suit, the aforesaid Joki Woler Ruzer transferred and assigned his rights of the entire land i.e. Survey No.48 Hissa No.15 in favour of one Mahendra Gala, the predecessor-in-interest of the Gala’s. The aforesaid Mahendra Gala was impleaded as plaintiff in the aforesaid suit on 28.07.1998 and subsequently on his death, the present Gala’s were substituted as his heir and legal representative. 11. The suit was contested by the Ramani’s by filing a written statement. They resisted the claim of the Gala’s regarding easementary rights over the disputed rasta. They contended that they have purchased the property Survey No.57 Hissa No.13A/1 and categorically denied use of the said rasta uninterruptedly by the Gala’s. 12. In the said suit, oral and documentary evidence were adduced by the parties. The Gala’s produced Navneet Liladhar Hariya, their Power of Attorney holder and the Manager of the property as PW-1, Bhalchandra Nathura Choradhekar, Sarpanch of the village as PW- 2, Dattatray Shankar Sawant, one of their neighbours as PW-3 and Bhalchandra Dattaram Tandel, Surveyor as PW-4, in to prove their easementary right of way over the disputed rasta. 364 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
