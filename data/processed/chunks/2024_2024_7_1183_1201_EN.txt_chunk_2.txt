Liability to pay customs duty in such confiscation proceedings under Section 125(2) is distinct from the assessment and determination of duty, which can rise only under Section 28. The duty liability arising under Section 125(2) must be assessed under Section 28. Thus, we answered the second question by holding that once Section 28 applies for determination of duty, interest on delayed payment of duty under Section 28AB follows. We have also clarified that Jagdish Cancer case is not an authority for the proposition that when the liability to pay customs duty arises under Section 125(2), the calculation, determination or the assessment of such duty cannot be made under Section 28. 1.2. The facts relevant for consideration of the issues are as follows. 2. Facts: Between 30.11.2003 to 18.04.2007, the appellant availed the benefit of exemption from payment of customs duty under a notification dated 01.03.2002, as per which certain self-propelled hydraulic piling rigs were to be utilised exclusively for the construction of roads, bridges etc. for NHAI3 and PWD.4 When investigations revealed that the appellant has violated the import conditions, even before a show-cause notice was issued, the appellant deposited Rs.16,29,22,282/- and interest of Rs. 1,84,39,696/- between May, 2 [2001] Supp. 1 SCR 245 : (2001) 6 SCC 483, hereinafter referred to as Jagdish Cancer case. 3 National Highways Authority of India. 4 Public Works Department. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1187 M/s Navayuga Engineering Co. Ltd. v. Union of India & Anr. 2007 to August, 2007. Thereafter, a show-cause notice5 was issued on 23.01.2008 proposing confiscation under Section 111(o) with respect to goods that were valued at Rs. 48.55 crores involving duty liability of Rs. 17,37,57,039/- under Section 28, interest under Section 28AB and penalties under Sections 112(a) and (b) and 114A of the Act. The appellant filed an application under Section 127B of the Act before the Settlement Commission claiming that it has not violated any condition of the notification dated 01.03.2002 and further claimed that in to avoid prolonged litigation, they had accepted the liability subject to further adjustments as may be approved by the Settlement Commission. The appellant also asserted that the claim for interest under Section 28AB is impermissible as the proceedings were initiated with show cause notice under Section 124 and not under Section 28. 2.1. The Settlement Commission upheld the duty liability and directed it to be recovered. The penalty and fine were waived in full in view of the finding that this is not a case of brazen defiance of law and also that there is no contumacious conduct such as misdeclaration or manipulation of documents to evade payment of duty. On payment of interest under Section 28AB, the Settlement Commission held that, for violation of post-importation conditions, imported goods become liable for confiscation but are redeemable on payment of fine in lieu of confiscation and the duty becomes payable under Section 125(2). Following the decision of this Court in Jagdish Cancer case, the Commission held that as Section 28 is inapplicable in confiscation proceedings, Section 28AB will also not be attracted.
