The wisdom of the legislature as reflected in the Amendment – was to subject to income tax, articles like gold, jewellery and other valuable items- typically owned with the intention of avoiding income tax-by translating income into buying D and then hiding such precious high value items. Premium price cannot be attributed to an otherwise ordinary and common place article like bitumen only on the basis of huge mass of bitumen. It would be an incorrect way to categorize bitumen as a ‘valuable article’, under Section 69A of the Income Tax, Act. E 18. While doing the above analysis,the 1976 song “The First Hello, The Last Goodbye” written & sung by the British singer Roger Whittaker is buzzing in my mind. The singer here goes lyrical while crooning about things of great value andaptly sings”…gold would not be precious if we all had gold to spare…..”. Taking a cue from the song’s lyrics, it F can be appropriately said that the legislature while introducing section 69A to the Income Tax, Act, 1961 by the Finance Act, 1964, was concerned only with such precious and aspirational articles like bullion and jewellery which are capable of being repositories of hidden earnings but were not really concerned about commonplace stuff like “bitumen”, which would not attract a second glance, on any road surface of our G country. 19. In conclusion, it is held that bitumen is not a valuable article in the context of Section 69A and the assessee here was not the owner of the concerned bitumen for the purpose of section 69A of H 598 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A the Income Tax Act, 1961.With the additional reasoning in the preceding paragraphs, I concur with the delivered by my brother Justice K.M. Joseph. Bibhuti Bhushan Bose Appeals allowed.
