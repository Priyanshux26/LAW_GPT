Despite the said statement, the Minutes of the meeting dated 03.06.2020, treated F the letter of 04.05.2020 (by APPCB) as if Sanvira’s original capacity was 3,30,000 MTPA, ignoring the consistent position, whereby its claims to that effect were rejected about five times previously. [Paras 23-27][153-D-E; 154-B; 156-A-B, E; 157-E, H; 158-A] 1.4 The reasoning of the impugned is that there G was no distinction (contrary to the conclusion of the single judge) regarding the public notice dated 17.04.2020 -between the certificate in the first part and the consent to operate in the second part. The Division Bench noted, correctly that the annual total limit of import of 1.4 Million Metric Tonnes was based on the H 136 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A total production capacity as on 09.10.2018 which had been fixed by this court on the basis of the capacity disclosed by all the calciners. It was also observed that an SPCB could indicate the permissible limit of production of calcined petroleum coke. For Sanvira it was 2,00,000 MTPA; the consent to produce 3,30,000 MTPA of coke was given only after 29th November 2018. B Therefore, it could not have been considered by the court. The certificate dated 04.05.2020 issued by the APPCB merely certified that the installed capacity of Sanvira, as on 09.10.2018, for manufacturing calcined petroleum coke, was 3,30,000 Metric Tonnes per annum in terms of the CTO. The total figure of 1.4 C Million Metric Tonnes of RPC was based on the permissible capacity as on 09.10.2018. The Division Bench, therefore, concluded that if production capacity had increased, the proportionate share to be given was after clearance by this court. The view expressed by the impugned is correct. Barring the fact that a clarification was issued on 04.05.2020, by the D APPCB, there was no change in circumstance; the material document to be considered was the CTO, which for the relevant period (i.e. as on 09.10.2018) was 2,00,000 MT per annum, for Sanvira. Even according to it, the claim for enhancement was made later, and the CTO for the increased capacity was issued on 26.12.2019. In these circumstances, the clarification of E APPCB, that as on a particular date, the production capacity was 3,30,000 MTPA was of no consequence, because it was the CTO that was considered all along, in all previous meetings. Therefore, the findings and conclusions of the Division Bench cannot be faulted. [Paras 28 and 29][158-E-H; 159-A-C] F M.C. Mehta v. Union of India [W.P. No 13029/1985] – referred to.
