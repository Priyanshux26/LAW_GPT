Respondents and for unforeseen delays such as strike, red alerts etc. I also consider 10% of contract value towards loss of overheads and 10% towards loss of profi t/profi tability as reasonable. On these (sic) basis, the Compensation works out to Rs.78,68,833.00 towards loss of overheads and an equal amount of Rs.78,68,833.00 towards loss of profi t/profi tability, the total being Rs.1,57,37,666.00 after taking into account the same percentage from payments already received by them for the work done. I award this amount to the Claimants. While awarding the above compensation, the existence of the means to mitigate the loss has been considered. According to me, the only means available to the claimants, was to work on Sundays and Holidays, to make up for the lost time to some extent, which was denied by the Respondents except for a brief period at the very end. This brief relaxation was not of much signifi cance in determining the compensation payable to the claimants. Claim No.2 – Compensation for idle machinery and equipment: Rs.84,59,615.00 This claim is for machinery and equipment deployed in the execution of this contract, but had to idle for large part of the time, due to extended contract period. I have inspected the site. I am of the opinion that there is substance in the claim. After due consideration of all aspects, I award an amount of Rs.50,000.00 per month for a period of 24 months which comes to Rs.12,00,000.00 Claim No.3 – Compensation for losses incurred due to increased cost of Materials and Labour: Rs.26,89,638.00 Even though the escalation in cost of material and labour is a normal feature when Engineering Contracts such as this gets unduly delayed, since escalation is not permitted as per the contract the claim stands rejected totally. Claim No.4 – Compensation for carrying out Extra Work: Rs.19,00,225.00 The claim consists of the following 4 items: 448 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. (i) Transportation of excavated earth Rs.12,05,000.00 (ii) Dewatering charges incurred during Rs.5,62,570.00 delayed period (iii) Shifting charges for material Rs.1,01,405.00 (iv) Shifting charges for Filter media Rs.31,250.00 The above jobs have been carried out in relation to the main contract, but have fi gured as extra items due to certain omissions and commissions by the owner-respondents. The claimants have compelled and produced vouchers and documents in support of their claim. I am not satisfi ed with all the details furnished. Therefore, against the above claim, I awarded to the extent I am satisfi ed with the documentation, as under: Item No.I Rs.1,20,000.00 towards transportation of excavated earth dumped by other contractors in the work site, prior to award of contract but after submission of the off er.
