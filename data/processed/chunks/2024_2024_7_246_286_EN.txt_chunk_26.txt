We are cognisant that Article 19(2) of the Constitution is exhaustive of the limitations that can be applied on the freedom guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a)127. The framework we wish to lay down is in line with our findings in Vikash 121 See Directorate of Film Festivals v Gaurav Ashwin Jain 2007 (4) SCC 737 122 Padma Sundara Rao v. State of Tamil Nadu, (2002) 3 SCC 533 [12. 14] 123 State of Punjab v. Salil Sabhlok, (2013) 5 SCC 1 [33, 36] 124 P. Ramachandra Rao v. State of Karnataka, (2002) 4 SCC 578 [25, 26] 125 See Raj Kapoor (supra) 126 Census Commissioner v. R Krishnamurthy, (2015) 2 SCC 796 [24-26] 127 See Indibly (supra) 284 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Kumar (supra) where we emphasised that the fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution apply with equal rigour to persons with disabilities. 74. The language of our discourse ought to be inclusive rather than alienating. We noted in Vikash Kumar (supra), that insensitive language was contrary to the dignity of persons with disabilities.128 As long as the overall message of the film justifies the depiction of disparaging language being used against persons with disabilities, it cannot be subjected to restrictions beyond those placed in Article 19(2). However, language that disparages persons with disabilities, marginalises them further and supplements the disabling barriers in their social participation, without the redeeming quality of the overall message of such portrayal must be approached with caution. Such representation is problematic not because it offends subjective feelings but rather, because it impairs the objective societal treatment of the affected groups by society.129 We believe that representation of persons with disabilities must regard the objective social context of their representation and not marginalise persons with disability: (i) Words cultivate institutional discrimination. Terms such as “cripple” and “spastic” have come to acquire devalued meanings in societal perceptions about persons with disabilities. They contribute to the negative self-image and perpetuate discriminatory attitudes and practices in society; (ii) Language that individualises the impairment and overlooks the disabling social barriers (e.g. terms such as “afflicted”, “suffering”, and “victim”) should be avoided or adequately flagged as contrary to the social model130; (iii) Creators must check for accurate representation of a medical condition as much as possible. The misleading portrayal of what a condition such as night blindness entails may perpetuate misinformation about the condition, and entrench stereotypes about persons with such impairments, aggravating the disability; 128 Vikash Kumar (supra) [84] 129 Jeremy Waldron (supra) 130 See Vikash Kumar (supra) [84-86] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 285 Nipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors. (iv) Persons with disabilities are under-represented. Average people are unaware of the barriers persons with disabilities face. Visual media must reflect their lived experiences. Their portrayal must capture the multitudes of their lived realities, and should not be a uni-dimensional, ableist characterisation; (v) Visual media should strive to depict the diverse realities of persons with disabilities, showcasing not only their challenges but also their successes, talents, and contributions to society.
