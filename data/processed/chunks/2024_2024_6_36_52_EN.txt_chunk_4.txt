43 Deependra Yadav and Others v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Others or equal to the prescribed “cut off” of the unreserved category and who have taken the benefit of relaxations from time to time, shall be included in the respective category by separating them from the list of unreserved category. (iii) In the second phase, category-wise cut off marks of the reserved candidates shall be determined by preparing category-wise separate lists of candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Economically Weaker Sections. ….. (c) After preparation of all the five lists, a common list of eligible candidates shall be prepared and thereafter the result shall be declared roll number wise. 8. Further, the amended Rule 4(3)(d)(III) was altogether omitted from the Rules of 2015. The result of such omission and Rule 4(1)(a) (ii), as it presently reads, is that meritorious reservation category candidates, who did not avail any benefit of relaxation, are to be clubbed with meritorious unreserved category candidates at the time of declaring the result of the preliminary examination itself. In effect, status quo ante was restored. 9. Notwithstanding this amendment, the result of the main examination held between 21.03.2021 and 26.03.2021 was declared by the MPPSC on 31.12.2021 and the number of candidates who provisionally qualified for interviews were 1918. However, by dated 07.04.2022, a Division Bench of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur partly allowed the pending writ petitions, viz., W.P. No. 542 of 2021 and batch, titled ‘Kishor Choudhary vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and another’. Challenge in this batch of cases was not only to the validity of amended Rule 4(3)(d)(III) of the Rules of 2015 but also to Section 4(4) of the Madhya Pradesh Lok Seva (Anusuchit Jatiyon, Anusuchit Jan Jatiyon aur Anya Pichhade Vargon Ke Liye Arakshan) Adhiniyam, 1994 (for brevity, ‘the Adhiniyam’). Section 4(4) of the Adhiniyam reads as follows: - ‘4(4). If a person belonging to any of the categories mentioned in sub-section (2) gets selected on the basis of merit in an open competition with general candidates, 44 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports he shall not be adjusted against the vacancies reserved for such category under sub-section (2).’ The Division Bench upheld the validity of Section 4(4) of the Adhiniyam but declared Rule 4(3)(d)(III) of the Rules of 2015 ultra vires and set it aside. The Division Bench directed that, resultantly, the recruitment process must be conducted and completed in consonance with the unamended Rules of 2015. 10. Thereupon, the MPPSC issued Advertisement dated 29.09.2022 proposing to reconduct the main examination in compliance with the Division Bench . This examination was proposed to be conducted in the second week of January, 2023. Further, on 10.10.2022, the MPPSC declared the revised result of the preliminary examination, in tune with the unamended Rule 4 of the Rules of 2015. In consequence, 13,080 candidates were declared qualified for the main examination, instead of the 10,767 candidates declared eligible earlier as per amended Rule 4(3)(d)(III).
