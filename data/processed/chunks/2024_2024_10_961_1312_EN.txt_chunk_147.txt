Further, Clause 5.9 provided that “the Government will give due consideration to certain difficulties expressed by AASU/AAGSP regarding the implementation of IMDT Act, 1983”. 79. Clause 5 also provided for detection of people entering into Assam between 01.01.1966 and 24.03.1971. For this category of immigrants, citizenship was to be granted in terms of Clause 5.3 of the Accord. As per the said Clause, immigrants belonging to the aforesaid category were to be detected in accordance with the Foreigners Act, 1946 and the Foreigners (Tribunals) , 1964. As per Clause 5.4, upon detection the names of such immigrants were to be deleted from the electoral rolls and subsequently they would be required to get themselves registered for grant of citizenship in accordance with the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939 and the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1939, failing which they would be liable to get deported. Ten years post such detection, their names would be reinstated on the electoral rolls. Clause 5.3 subsequently became the basis of Section 6A(3) of the Citizenship Act. III. SUBMISSIONS ON THE DAMAGE CAUSED DUE TO THE INFLUX OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS INTO ASSAM 80. It is the case of the petitioners that the acute problem of illegal immigration has led to a major change of demography in the State of Assam, and is posing a serious threat to the unity, integrity and security of India. It was submitted before us that Section 6A of the Citizenship Act has directly impacted the political landscape of the 1172 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports State by granting citizenship to a large number of immigrants from Bangladesh thereby rendering the local population a minority. 81. It was submitted by the petitioners that the grant of citizenship in the manner provided under Section 6A of the Citizenship Act has altered the demographics of the State of Assam, which has led to the marginalization of the citizens belonging to various indigenous and ethnic groups living in the State prior to the coming into force of Section 6A. 82. The petitioners relied on a report relating to the unabated influx of people from Bangladesh into Assam dated 08.11.1998 submitted to the President by the then Governor of Assam, Lt. General (retd.) Shri S.K. Sinha.58 The following key findings of the report were highlighted during the course of the hearing: a. The report was prepared keeping in mind the demographic change in Tripura and Sikkim to highlight the issues that have arisen and that may arise with the unabated influx of immigrants which has been legitimized/attempted to be legitimized with Section 6A of the Citizenship Act.
