15. In the present case, it is not in dispute that the First Appeal which was allowed by the High Court vide and dated 2nd May 2016 was in respect of the land which was covered by the same notification under which notification the appellants’ land is also covered. It is also not in dispute that the amount awarded by the High Court in the said First Appeal is in excess of the amount awarded [2024] 12 S.C.R. 475 Banwari and Others v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited(HSIIDC) and Another by the Collector under Section 11 of the 1894 Act in the case of the land of the appellants. It is also not in dispute that the appellants had not made an application to the Collector under Section 18 of the 1894 Act. It is also not in dispute that the application made by the appellants under Section 28-A of the 1894 Act to the Collector was within a period of three months from the date of the and of the High Court. 16. From the perusal of the of this Court in the case of Pradeep Kumari and Others (supra), it is clear that the limitation for moving the application under Section 28-A of the 1894 Act will begin to run only from the date of the award on the basis of which redetermination of the compensation is sought. The appellants are seeking redetermination of the compensation on the basis of the and of the High Court in First Appeal No.429 of 2023 dated 2nd May 2016. It is not disputed that the application of the appellants under Section 28-A of the 1894 Act is within a period of three months from 2nd May 2016. 17. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the case of the appellants is fully covered by the of this Court in the case of Pradeep Kumari and Others (supra). 18. It is further to be noted that the cases of Pradeep Kumari and Others (supra) and Ramsingbhai (Ramsangbhai) Jerambhai (supra), both have been decided by a Bench strength of three learned Judges of this Court. The case of Pradeep Kumari and Others (supra) is decided on 10th March 1995, whereas Ramsingbhai (Ramsangbhai) Jerambhai (supra), has been decided on 24th April 2018. 19. A perusal of the rendered in Ramsingbhai (Ramsangbhai) Jerambhai (supra), would reveal that the said case does not take note of the earlier view taken by three learned judges of this Court in the case of Pradeep Kumari and Others (supra). 20. In this respect, we may gainfully refer to the observations of a Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi and Others.3 The relevant paragraphs of the read as under: 3 2017 INSC 1068 : [2017] 13 SCR 100 : (2017) 16 SCC 680 476 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “27. We are compelled to state here that in Munna Lal Jain, the three-Judge Bench should have been guided by the principle stated in Reshma Kumari which has concurred with the view expressed in Sarla Verma or in case of disagreement, it should have been well advised to refer the case to a larger Bench.
