Thus, it is clear that a majority of judges of this Court did not adopt the view advanced by 104 Kaikhosrou (Chick) Kavasji Framji v. Union of India (2019) 20 SCC 705 [40-46] : 2019 INSC 378 105 [2018] 7 SCR 379 : (2018) 10 SCC 1 [442-446] : 2018 INSC 790 106 [2021] 4 SCR 633 : (2021) 15 SCC 125 [50] : 2021 INSC 210 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 115 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. Justice Krishna Iyer on the interpretation of Article 39(b). In such a situation, the bench of five judges in Sanjeev Coke was bound by the view of the majority in Ranganatha Reddy, which was a decision rendered by a bench of seven judges. The view taken by a minority of three judges and specifically disagreed with by the majority of four judges could not be relied on by a smaller bench of five judges in Sanjeev Coke. Not only was the opinion in the of a minority of judges not binding, but it also could not be relied on as having persuasive value, since there was a majority opinion of a larger bench disagreeing with the view. 105. The majority in Ranganatha Reddy did not discuss its interpretation of Article 39(b) and merely expressed their disagreement simpliciter with the view of the concurring minority. Therefore, it is undoubtedly possible that the bench of a lower quorum in Sanjeev Coke was perplexed about the interpretation of Article 39(b) that it was bound to follow. In such a situation it was open to the bench to have brought this to the attention of the Chief Justice and requested for the matter to be placed before a larger bench. A part of the beauty of minority opinions undoubtedly lies in the hope of the author that, in some cases, they may become the law when adopted by a majority in a future case.107 However, this cannot be done by compromising on judicial discipline. To this effect, this Court in Sanjeev Coke erred in relying on the observations in the opinion of Justice Krishna Iyer in Ranganatha Reddy, when the binding opinion of the majority of judges expressly stated their inability to agree with those observations. c. The error has been carried forward in subsequent decisions 106. Mr Tushar Mehta, the learned Solicitor General of India, has argued that this Court has consistently upheld the observations of Justice Krishna Iyer in Ranganatha Reddy and this is not a case of jurisprudential inconsistency or conflicting decisions. The observations in Sanjeev Coke on Article 39(b), adopting the minority 107 The famous words of Chief Justice Hughes: “A dissent in a court of last resort is an appeal to the brooding spirit of the law, to the intelligence of a future day when a later decision may possibly correct the error into which the dissenting judge believes the court to have been betrayed...... Nor is this always in vain. In a number of cases dissenting opinions have in time become law.”[HUGHES, THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, (1930) American BarAsson.
