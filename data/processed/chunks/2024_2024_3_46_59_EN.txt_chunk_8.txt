109 of Saptapur has not been shown but, it has been included equally among the both the parties and consists of Guava garden. Following lands have not been divided as they are not in physical position and cases regarding them are pending and they will be equally distributed after the settlement of cases. The above mentioned are as under: Village A-G Sl-No-/Bl.No. 1) Nuggikeri 3-34 129 2) Nuggikeri 1-00 31 3) Nuggikeri 1-00 37 4) Kanavihonnapur 2-09 87/A 5) Kanavihonnapur 1-38 81” 21. Even with reference to property bearing Regular Survey No. 44/4, also we do not find that the matter needs to be remanded back for the reason that in the family partition held in the year 1984 clearly the aforesaid Regular Survey No. was assigned to the share of late [2024] 3 S.C.R. 59 Srinivas Raghavendrarao Desai (Dead) By Lrs. v. V. Kumar Vamanrao @ Alok and Ors. Raghavendrarao Hanamanthrao Desai, who was the predecessor- in-interest of the appellants. The area clearly mentioned therein was seven acres, hence there is no dispute. 22. So far as the argument raised by learned counsel for the respondents regarding sale conducted by defendant No. 7 in favour of defendant No. 9 to be in violation of the interim passed by the Trial Court is concerned, suffice it to state that the interim restraining defendants No.1 to 4 from alienating the property in question was passed by the Trial Court on 31.05.1999. As on that date, defendant No. 7 was not party to the suit as he was impleaded only on 02.01.2001. There is no passed by the Trial Court thereafter directing that the interim was further extended qua the newly impleaded defendant also, hence it cannot be said to be a case of wilful violation of the passed by the Trial Court. 23. The passed by High Court in Writ Petition No. 11431 of 1977 filed by Sudheendra, decided on 25.03.1983, does not come to the rescue of the respondents for the reason that the same was passed before the partition was effected between the parties on 30.08.1984. Secondly, it was a Writ Petition filed by defendant No. 1 through his grand father as he was minor at that time. The Writ Petition was filed against the State seeking quashing of dated 21.05.1976 passed by Special Land Tribunal, Dharwad. Without there being any material and the parties affected or beneficiary of 1965 partition being party, the Court recorded that there is no dispute that there was such a partition. 24. For the reasons mentioned above, the appeals are allowed. The findings of the High Court with reference to Regular Survey Nos. 106/2 and 44/4 are set aside. The same are held to be the properties coming to the share of the appellants. The sale deed executed by the appellant (since deceased) in favour of defendant No. 9 regarding Survey No. 106/2 is upheld. Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan Result of the case: Appeals allowed.
