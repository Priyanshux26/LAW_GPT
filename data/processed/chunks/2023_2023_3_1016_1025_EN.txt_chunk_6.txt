8. Now so far as the land acquired vide notification dated 5.3.2007 is concerned, there shall be a corresponding increase looking to the time gap of approximately one year and nine months and giving 8 to 12 percent cumulative increase. However, the High Court has determined the D compensation @ Rs. 45,00,000/- per acre on the basis of the sale deed (Ex. P4) by applying 10% cut. It is to be noted that so far as the first notification dated 30.06.2005 is concerned, the High Court has applied the cut of 50%. Even otherwise, it is to be noted that the sale deed produced as Ex. P4 is dated 2.11.2006 and the acquisition of the same villages commenced vide notification dated 30.06.2005 and therefore E the sale deed after the first notification dated 30.06.2005 could not have been the basis for assessing/determining the compensation with respect to the subsequent acquisition. On the contrary, giving 8 to 12 percent cumulative increase on the amount of compensation awarded for the land acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005, would be a safe and F guiding factor. If that be so, compensation with respect to the land acquired vide notification dated 5.3.2007, would come to Rs. 30,73,280/- per acre (Rs. 24,50,000/- + 12% increase = Rs.27,44,000/- + 12% increase = Rs.30,73,280/-). To the aforesaid extent, the impugned common and G passed by the High Court is required to be modified and the present appeals are required to be partly allowed accordingly. 9. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeals succeed in part. The impugned common and passed by the High Court insofar as the land acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005 is concerned, is modified and it is ed H HARYANA STATE INDUSTRIAL & INFRASTRUCTURE 1025 DEVELOPMENT CORP. LTD. v. SATPAL [M. R. SHAH, J.] that the landowners/claimants shall be entitled to compensation @ Rs. A 24,50,000/- per acre (instead of Rs. 29,54,000/- per acre), with all other statutory benefits which may be available under the provisions of the 1894 Act. 9.1 Insofar as the land acquired vide notification dated 5.3.2007 is concerned, the impugned common and is modified and B it is ed that the landowners/claimants shall be entitled to compensation @ Rs. 30,73,280/- per acre (instead of Rs. 45,00,000/- per acre) with all other statutory benefits which may be available under the provisions of the 1894 Act. 10.
