The deceased was a truck driver and had four mouths to feed at the time of his demise in the year 2011. By no stretch of imagination, it can be construed that income which he was earning as claimed by his wife in her statement B made on oath can be construed as excessive or not commensurate with the wages earned by a truck driver in the year 2011. 12. Thus, the irresistible conclusion which we have to draw is, the unchallenged statement of the wife of the deceased who had deposed that her husband was earning Rs.6,000/- per month deserves to be C accepted as gospel truth. We see no reason for disbelieving her statement. 13. In the light of the aforestated discussion, the quantification of the compensation will have to be redetermined by construing the income of the deceased at Rs.6,000/- and after deducting 50 per cent of the same loss of income to the claimants will have to be held at Rs.3,000/- D per month and adopting the appropriate factor having regard to the fact that the deceased was 22 years at the time of his accidental death, the appropriate multiplier would be 221.37. Thus, the compensation that the claimants would be entitled to would be Rs.3,000 X 221.37 which is equal to Rs.6,64,110/- (Rupees Six Lakhs Sixty Four Thousand One E Hundred and Ten only). 14. The mandate of the Act insofar as payment of interest is concerned is clear and unambiguous viz., the claimants would be entitled to interest @ 12 per cent per annum from one month after the date of accident till date of payment. Thus, claimants would be entitled to the F interest accordingly, excluding the amount which is said to have been paid or deposited by the first respondent-insurer. 15. For the reasons aforestated, we allow this appeal in part and set aside the impugned dated 01.10.2018 passed in Miscellaneous Application No. 777 of 2014 by the High Court of Judicature G at Patna and award a compensation of Rs.6,64,110/-(Rupees Six Lakhs Sixty Four Thousand One Hundred and Ten only) with interest @ 12% p.a. from one month from the date of accident till date of payment excluding the amount already paid or deposited by the first respondent- insurer. H 1138 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 16. The balance amount shall be deposited by the first respondent- insurer before the Deputy Labour Commissioner-cum-Commissioner for Workmen Compensation, Magadh Division, Gaya, in C.W.C. Case No.24 of 2011 expeditiously and at any rate, within six weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of this . B 17. Costs made easy. Divya Pandey Appeal partly allowed.
