Held: When it comes to uniform approach the laws relating to fiscal or tax measures enjoy greater latitude than other statutes. [Paras 1, 3, 34, and 35] Interpretation of Statute – Popular meaning makes the statute simpler and easier for the common people – After all, it is the common person who is concerned with the ramifications of a statute, and thus, the common man’s understanding is the definitive index of the legislative intent – This rule equally applies to construing words or expressions in a taxation statute. Section 17(2(viii) is a residuary clause, enacted to provide flexibility – Since it is enacted as an enabling catch- within-domain provision, the residuary clause is not iron-cast and exacting – The expression ‘perquisite’ is well-understood by a common person who is conversant with the subject matter of a taxing statute. Held: The legislature can and does delineate the meaning of terms through explicit definitions – Explicit definitions are useful, but it is wrong to state that all words or expressions must be explicitly defined – Popular meaning makes the statute simpler and easier for the common people – After all, it is the common person who is concerned with the ramifications of a statute, and thus, the common man’s understanding is the definitive index of the legislative intent – The legislature is assumed to be aware of the well-understood meaning attributed to the word/expression, and by necessary implication the legislature by not prescribing a fixed and exact definition, ascribes the prevalent meaning assigned to the word/expression in common parlance or commercial usage – This would include meaning assigned to technical words in a particular trade, business or profession, etc – when the legislation is concerning a particular trade, business or transaction – This rule equally applies to construing words or expressions in a taxation statute.
