Moreover, reference was made 280 [1973] Supp. 1 SCR 1 : (1973) 4 SCC 225 [210] 1694 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports to the decision in Kalpana Mehta v. Union of India,281 to contend that the Constitution must be interpreted in a manner that leads to the discovery of “constitutional silences or abeyances.” Therefore, it was contended that Entry 50 of List II contemplates an implicit denudation of legislative powers of States once a law relating to mineral development was enacted by Parliament under Entry 54 of List I. 226. The theory of implied limitations was adopted in Kesavananda Bharati (supra) to iterate that the basic structure doctrine serves as an implied limitation on the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution.282 The power of Parliament to amend the Constitution was subjected to the basic structure doctrine. The doctrine of implied limitations is not applicable in the present case in view of the fact that Entry 50 of List II specifies the nature of the limitation and the manner in which it can be imposed. The implication that any law enacted by Parliament under Entry 54 of List I will impliedly denude the powers of the state legislature under Entry 50 of List II will usurp the taxing powers of the States. 227. The principle of constitutional silences has generally been used to step in where the Constitution is silent or where there is a legislative vacuum.283 Entry 50 of List II is clear in its terms – a limitation can be imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development. In the face of an express constitutional provision, there is no scope for this Court to use this doctrine to limit the legislative powers of the State. 228. In P Kannadasan v. State of Tamil Nadu,284 a two judge Bench held that Parliament has denuded the States of their power to levy taxes on minerals by making the declaration contained in Section 2 of the MMDR Act. It was further observed that State legislatures cannot levy any tax or cess on minerals so long as the declaration in Section 2 stands. The observations in P Kannadasan (supra) are contrary to the legislative scheme discussed above. 281 [2018] 4 SCR 1 : (2018) 7 SCC 1 282 See I R Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (2007) 2 SCC 1 283 Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997) 6 SCC 241; Anoop Baranwal v. Union of India (2023) 6 SCC 161 284 [1996] Supp. 4 SCR 92 : (1996) 5 SCC 670 [35] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1695 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. d. Section 9 does not serve as a limitation on the taxing powers of State 229. Having noticed that the scheme of the MMDR Act does not in itself serve as a limitation on the field of taxation under Entry 50 of List II, we now proceed to examine whether the statute contains any provision imposing “any limitations” on it.
