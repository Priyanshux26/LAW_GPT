119. Second, Article 341(2) provides that only Parliament can include in or exclude from the List any caste, tribe, race or their parts or groups. The Presidential notification cannot be varied by any subsequent notification, other than by an inclusion or exclusion by Parliament. By completely vesting in Parliament the power to include or exclude from the Presidential List, Article 341(2) correspondingly limits the power of the President (acting on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers at the Centre) and the Governor (acting on the aid and advice of the State Government when consulted) to include or exclude castes or sub-castes from the List. 120. In Chinnaiah (supra), this Court interpreted Article 341(2) as a limit on the power of the President to “tinker” with the list.175 Article 172 Marri (supra) [9] 173 [2018] 10 SCR 513 : (2018) 10 SCC 312. 174 ibid, [Justice Gogoi, 34]; [Justice Banumathi, 79, 81] 175 Chinnaiah (supra), [Justice Hegde, 43] 1402 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 341(2) consists of two parts. First, it grants only Parliament the power to “include or exclude” any caste or group, or a part of the caste or group, and second, “save as aforesaid”, a notification issued by the President under Article 341(1) shall not be varied by any other subsequent notification. It is important to understand the purport of the second part of the provision to understand the scope of Article 342(2). 121. The second part of Article 341(2) must be read in the context of Article 367. Article 367 provides that unless the context otherwise requires, the General Clauses Act 1897 shall apply for the interpretation of the Constitution as it applies to the interpretation of an Act of the Legislature of the Dominion of India. Section 21 of the General Clauses Act 1897 states that the power to issue notifications includes the power to add to, amend, vary or rescind the notification.176 By Article 341(1) read with Article 367 and Section 21 of the General Clauses Act 1897, the President would have the power to add to, amend, vary or rescind the notification. The first part of Article 341(2) removes the power of the President to include in and exclude from the List and places it in the domain of Parliament. This power is traceable to the words “add to” or “amend” in Section 21 of the General Clauses Act. The second part of Article 341(2) ensures that the President does not have any residual power to “vary” the List. The phrase “vary” in common parlance has a wider meaning than exclusion or inclusion. It includes altering the list, even by partial change.177 However, the phrase “vary” in Article 341(2) takes the meaning of inclusion in and exclusion from the List, and not the other way around. This is clear with the use of the phrase “save as aforesaid” in the second part of the provision. Thus, by Article 341(2), the President does not have the power to vary the List notified under Article 341(1) by inclusion in and exclusion from it.
