16. Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties have received due consideration of the Court. 17. As we have noted above after initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process, Liquidator i.e. Respondent No.2 had issued sale notice dated 02.06.2021 for sale of the subject property of the corporate debtor. The reserve price of the subject property was fi xed at Rs.12.69 crores, whereas EMD was fi xed at Rs.1,26,19,000.00. E-auction was scheduled on 23.06.2021 between 14.00 to 14.30 hrs. This E-auction did not fructify in the absence of any bidders. Thereafter, Respondent No. 2 issued second sale notice dated 28.06.2021 for auction sale amongst others of the subject property. This time the reserve price was scaled down to Rs.10 crores and correspondingly, the EMD was fi xed at Rs.1 crore. Last date for deposit of EMD was 19.07.2021 and the date and time of bid was fi xed as 20.07.2021 at 14.30 hrs. It was mentioned therein that the E-auction sale would be subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in E-Auction Process Information Document available at the website of the second Respondent. 17.1. As it appears, appellant was the sole bidder and its bid value was Rs.10 crores which was equivalent to the reserve price. 18. Pausing here for a moment, we may advert to the Bid Application Form. As per Clause-7 of the Bid Application Form, the applicant i.e. the bidder was required to adhere to the terms and conditions mentioned in the E-Auction Process Information Document. Clause-9 provided that the applicant would participate in the E-auction for the sale of assets on as is where is basis, as is what is basis, whatever there is basis and no recourse basis. Further, if selected as the highest bidder, the bid amount would be unconditionally binding on the applicant. Clause-12 made it clear that the applicant would at all time adhere to the provisions of the Code and the Regulations. 1 (2019) 4 SCC 17 880 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 19. The E-Auction Process Information Document was issued by the Liquidator i.e. Respondent No.2 for regulating the E-auction of the subject property of the corporate debtor. As per Clause 2 (g), unless specifi ed otherwise, EMD of the successful bidder would be retained towards part of the sale consideration and EMD of unsuccessful bidder would be refunded, which would not bear any interest. Clause 2 (h) says that in accordance with para 1(12) of Schedule I to the Regulations, on the closure of the auction, the highest bidder would be invited to provide balance sale consideration within 90 days of the date of such demand. As per proviso (i) of Clause 2(h), payments made after 30 days would attract interest at the rate of 12 per cent and as per proviso (ii) of Clause 2(h), the sale shall be cancelled if the payment is not received within 90 days. Clause 2 (i) says that on payment of the full amount, the sale would stand completed and the Liquidator would execute the certifi cate of sale or sale deed to transfer such assets which would be delivered to him in the manner specifi ed in the terms of sale.
