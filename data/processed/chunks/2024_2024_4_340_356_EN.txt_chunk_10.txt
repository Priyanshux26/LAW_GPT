The effect of adding “increased share capital” is that stamp duty will be charged on subsequent increases in the authorised share capital, subject to the maximum cap. In other words, the ceiling of Rs. 25 lakhs in Column 2 is applicable on Articles of Association and the increased share capital therein, not on every increase individually. In case stamp duty equivalent to or more than the cap has already been paid, no further stamp duty can be levied. For a better understanding, let us consider a hypothetical example: SHARE STAMP STAMP DUTY TO TOTAL CAPITAL OF A DUTY BE ACTUALLY PAID STAMP COMPANY PAYABLE DUE TO CAP DUTY 50 crores 10 lakhs 10 lakhs 10 lakhs 100 crores 10 lakhs 10 lakhs 20 lakhs 150 crores 10 lakhs 5 lakhs 25 lakhs 200 crores 10 lakhs Nil 25 lakhs 16. The fact that the maximum cap of Rs.25 lakhs would be applicable as a one-time measure and not on each subsequent increase in the share capital of a company is fortified directly by the Maharashtra [2024] 4 S.C.R. 355 State of Maharashtra & Anr. v. National Organic Chemical Industries Ltd. Stamp (Amendment) Act, 2015 which amended the charging section for Articles of Association i.e., Article 10 of the Stamp Act. The Section as it stands now is reproduced below: 1 2 Description of Instrument Proper Stamp Duty 10. ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION [0.2 per cent. on share capital OF A COMPANY – Where the or increased share capital, Company has no share capital or as the case may be] subject to nominal share capital or increased a maximum of Rs.50,00,000. share capital. The effect of the 2015 amendment is that “increased share capital” has also been added in Column 2 and proper stamp duty shall be calculated, for either of the three situations, as per the share capital or increased share capital. This means that the cap will now be applicable on each individual increase. 17. A reference can also be made to the provisions of Stamp Duty Acts of a few other States where Articles of Association are chargeable: STATE Description of Instrument Proper Stamp Duty Gujarat 7.
