Supreme Court Reports Held: Not sustainable – When clause (i) of s.5(8) is applicable, it is not necessary that the Financial Creditor actually tenders any amount to the Corporate Debtor – DoH is a Document creating hypothecation – Only the title of a document cannot be a decisive factor in deciding the nature of the document or the transactions affected by the document – Only because the title of the document contains the word hypothecation, it cannot be concluded that guarantee is not a part of this document – Appellants are Secured Lenders within the meaning of the Master Security Trustee Agreement-MSTA – Two RCom entities-RCom and RTL, are the obligors being the borrowers of the appellants – Parties to DoH are Security Trustees acting on behalf of the appellants, the Corporate Debtor who is not the borrower of the appellants and the other three Reliance entities – Corporate Debtor undertook to discharge the liability of the RCom and RTL, the borrowers of the appellants – RCom and RTL are third parties as far as Corporate Debtor is concerned – Furthermore, s.7(1) provides that Financial Creditor can initiate CIRP against the Corporate Debtor when there is a default on the part of the Corporate Debtor – Moment it is established that the financial debt is owed to any person, he/she becomes a Financial Creditor – On facts, the appellant has a claim – No requirement incorporated in the definition of ‘financial debt’ u/s.5(8) that a debt becomes financial debt only when default occurs – U/s.5(7) any person to whom financial debt is owed becomes a Financial Creditor even if there is no default in payment of debt – Thus, for submitting the claim by a Financial Creditor, no requirement of actual default – Impugned of the NCLAT quashed and set aside and that of the NCLT restored.
