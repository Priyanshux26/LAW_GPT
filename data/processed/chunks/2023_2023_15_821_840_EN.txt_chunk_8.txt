On the other 20 (2008) 7 SCC 487 21 Empress v. Ashootosh Chuckerbutty [ILR (1879-80) 4 Cal 483] 22 (2000) 5 SCC 355 M/S NORTH EASTERN CHEMICALS INDUSTRIES (P) LTD. 833 v. M/S ASHOK PAPER MILL (ASSAM) LTD. [SANJAY KAROL, J.] hand, the respondents argue that since an appeal under Section 22 (8) of the Jogighopa Act is to a principal court of original civil jurisdiction, which qualifi es as an appeal ‘governed by the Court’ – Article 116 of the Limitation Act shall be attracted. 13. The Constitution Bench in Vidyacharan Shukla referred to three s of High Courts in Aga Mahomed Hamadani v. Cohen23, Ramasami Pillai v. Deputy Collector of Madura24, and Dropadi v. Hira Lal25. In each of these three decisions, the respective High Courts were tasked with the question of application of Article 156 of the Limitation Act (now Article 116) to the Burma Court’s Act, the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1907 and Land Acquisition Act, 1894 respectively. In Cohen (supra) it was observed that “the natural meaning of an appeal under the Civil Procedure Code appears to us to be an appeal governed by the Code of Civil Procedure so far as procedure is concerned”. In Hira Lal (Supra) the full bench of the Allahabad High Court observed that the objection of Section 47 thereof appears to be to attract the provisions of the Code. In Ramasami Pillai (supra), it was held that by virtue of Section 54, the procedure in its entirety set out in the code to govern appeals, was made applicable to the Land Acquisition Act. Similar to the above said decisions of the High Courts this Court in the said decision was also dealing with a statute which expressly made applicable26, the provisions of the code. The holding, therefore, is that appeals provided for in special statutes that are governed by the code, can be said to be appeals under the code for the purposes of Article 116 of the Limitation Act. 14. We may now refer to Section 22(6) of the Jogighopa Act which deals with the powers vested in the Commissioner under the Act. The relevant portion of which reads as under: - “(6) The commissioner shall have the power to regulate his own procedure in all matters arising out of the discharge of his functions, including the place or places at which he will hold his sittings and 23 (1886) ILR 13 Cal 221 24 AIR 1920 Mad 407 25 ILR (1912) 34 All 496 (FB) 26 Section 90 of Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 834 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. shall, for the purpose of making an investigation under this Act, have the same powers as are vested in a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, in respect of the following matters, namely:- (a) The summoning and enforcing the attendance of any witness and examining him on Oath : (b) the discovery and production of any document or other material object producible as evidence ; (c) the reception of evidences on affi davits; (d) the issuing of any commission for the examination of witness.” 15.
