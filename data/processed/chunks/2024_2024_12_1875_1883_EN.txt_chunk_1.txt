Supreme Court Reports 5. The patient stayed in Pune overnight and on the very next day, i.e. on 20.01.1999, visited the respondent-doctor with complaint of severe pain in the operated eye and headache. The respondent changed the bandage of the operated eye, prescribed medicines along with eye drops and gave black glasses. The appellant was called back again on 23.01.1999 for checkup when the appellant, on his visit, complained to the respondent of intense pain in his operated eye. When the respondent-doctor removed the bandage and examined the right eye, the appellant could not even open his eye because of sticky fluid oozing out of his eye. The respondent-doctor replaced the bandages, assured the appellant that the operation was successful and prescribed certain pain killers and eye drops. At this stage, the appellant was also assured that his pain would subside and vision would be restored, and he was called for further checkup on 25.01.1999. 6. However, in the meanwhile, on 24.01.1999, the appellant was undergoing severe pain and headache and finally rushed to the respondent on 25.01.1999 wherein again certain medicines and painkiller tablets were prescribed by the respondent-doctor. As per the complainant, the condition of his eye worsened and the pain became unbearable, as a result of which he went to the respondent-doctor again on 26.01.1999 along with his wife and son.
