MH-09/CA-0389 (for short ‘the offending truck’) which was left abandoned in the middle of the highway without any warning signs in the form of indicators or parking lights. The collision resulted into the death of the passengers of the car, namely, Sunita, Ashtavinayak Patil, Deepali and the driver Saiprasad Karande at the spot. One of the passengers, namely, Smt. Sushma (wife of deceased- Ashtavinayak Patil) survived the accident, however, sustaining grievous injuries. The car was insured by respondent No. 4-IFFCO-TOKIO General Insurance Co. Ltd. (for short the ‘Insurance Company’), whereas, the offending truck was insured by respondent No.2-Insurer. 4. The injured Smt. Sushma and the legal heirs of the deceased occupants of the car filed separate claim petitions under Section 166 of the Act before the VI Additional District and Sessions Judge and Member, Additional Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Belagavi (hereinafter being referred to as ‘Tribunal’) claiming compensation from the owner of offending truck i.e. respondent No. 1 and the insurer of the offending truck i.e. respondent No.2-Insurer. No relief was sought by the claimants against the owner and the insurer of the car. The claimants alleged that since the offending truck was left [2024] 9 S.C.R. 429 Sushma v. Nitin Ganapati Rangole & Ors. abandoned in the middle of the highway without switching on the parking lights or indicators or without taking any other precautionary measures to warn the incoming traffic, the person in control of the said vehicle was fully responsible for the accident. 5. The Tribunal, while deciding the claims held that it was a case of contributory negligence by the drivers of both the vehicles. The Tribunal observed that the driver of the car had contributed to the accident because he failed to take appropriate preventive measures so as to avoid collision with the offending truck which was parked in the middle of the road. 6. As the appellant-claimants had not claimed compensation from owner of the car, i.e., respondent No.3-Shri Vasant Ravan Jadhawar and respondent No.4-Insurance Company of the car, these respondents were exonerated and the claims against them were dismissed. 7. The Tribunal computed the compensation as below: - MVC No. Amount(Rs.) 2277 of 2013 22,25,000.00 2278 of 2013 30,000.00 2279 of 2013 66,02,500.00 2280 of 2013 87,500.00 2281 of 2013 12,500.00 8. The Tribunal held the owner of the offending truck, respondent No.1 and the respondent No. 2-Insurer jointly and severally responsible to indemnify the claims of the appellant-claimants and at the same time directed reduction of the compensation awarded by 50% on account of contributory negligence. 9. Aggrieved by the quantum of compensation awarded and the reduction on account of contributory negligence, the appellant- claimants filed appeals under Section 173(1) of the Act before the High Court of Karnataka. 10. Upon hearing arguments advanced on behalf of the parties and appreciating the material available on record, the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka applied the rule of last opportunity and held that had the driver of the car been cautious, he could have avoided the accident.
