for the right to retail vend – The second transaction, which is contingent upon the first transaction, is obtaining of arrack for retail vending by the excise contractors on the strength of the permits issued to them post successful shortlisting following auction – Therefore, it is evidently clear that arrack is not obtained by the excise contractors by way of auction – What is obtained by way of auction is the right to vend the arrack on retail on the strength of permits granted, following successful shortlisting on the basis of auction – Thus, the first condition under clause (iii) is satisfied – Rule 4 of the 1967 Rules enables the excise contractor to sell the arrack in retail at a price within the range of minimum floor price and maximum ceiling price which is fixed by the Excise Commissioner – The price of arrack to be sold in retail is not dependent on the market forces but pre-determined within a range – Therefore, though price range is provided for by the statute, it cannot be said that because there is a price range providing for a minimum and a maximum, the sale price is not fixed – The sale price is fixed by the statute but within a particular range beyond which price, either on the higher side or on the lower side, the arrack cannot be sold by the excise contractor in retail – Since both the conditions as mandated under Explanation(a) (iii) are satisfied, the excise contractors or the liquor vendors selling arrack would not come within the ambit of “buyer” as defined under Explanation(a) to Section 206C of the Income Tax Act – Thus, the question framed in issue for consideration, is answered in the negative by holding that Section 206C of the Income Tax Act is not applicable in respect of Mysore Sales and that the liquor vendors(contractors) who bought the vending rights from the appellant on auction cannot be termed as “buyers” within the meaning of Explanation(a) to Section [2024] 7 S.C.R. 289 The Excise Commissioner Karnataka & Anr. v. Mysore Sales International Ltd. & Ors. 206C of the Income Tax Act – Thus, the High Court was not justified in dismissing the writ petitions and consequently, the writ appeal challenging the s dated 17.01.2001. [Paras 14.5, 15, 15.2, 16] Income Tax Act, 1961 – Karnataka Excise Act, 1965 – Karnataka Excise (Arrack Vend Special Conditions of Licenses) Rules, 1967 – Karnataka Excise (Lease of the Right of Retail Vend of Liquors) Rules, 1969 – Karnataka Excise (Manufacture and Bottling of Arrack) Rules, 1987 – Essentials of the Principle of Natural Justice to be followed: Held: In the instant case, though show cause notice was issued to the assessee to which reply was also filed, the same would not be adequate having regard to the consequences that such an passed under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act would entail. Even though the statute may be silent regarding notice and hearing, the court would read into such provision the inherent requirement of notice and hearing before a prejudicial is passed – Therefore, it is held that before an is passed under Section 206C of the Income Tax Act, it is incumbent upon the assessing officer to put the person concerned to notice and afford him an adequate and reasonable opportunity of hearing, including a personal hearing.
