15. A similar logic underscores the statutory provisions in 21, Rule 1 and 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 190852 to determine 52 Hereinafter “CPC”. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 317 DLF Ltd. (Formerly Known as DLF Universal Ltd) and Anr. v. Koncar Generators and Motors Ltd. whether interest will continue to operate on an amount deposited before a court. It would be relevant for us to briefly discuss the law on this point: 15.1 A constitution bench of this Court in Gurpreet Singh v. Union of India53 extensively discussed the rules governing interest calculation when the defendant/ -debtor deposits some part of the amount. 24 governs deposits at the pre-decretal stage and 21, Rule 1 at the post-decretal stage.54 The essence of these provisions is that on any amount deposited into the court, interest shall cease to run from the date when the depositor serves a notice to the plaintiff/decree- holder. Similarly, when payment is tendered to the decree-holder outside the court, interest ceases on such amount even if the payment is refused.55 15.2 21, Rule 1 embodies a rule of prudence that once the amount is tendered to the decree-holder by the - debtor, whether in the form of a court deposit or other forms of payment such as demand draft or cheque, the -debtor cannot be made liable to then pay interest on such amount.56 15.3 The rationale for this rule has been explained in Nepa Limited v. Manoj Kumar Agrawal 57 through a similar logic of the decree- holder being able to benefit from the deposited amount. In this case, the award-debtor deposited 50% of the awarded amount before the executing court to obtain a stay on the execution proceedings of the arbitral award during the pendency of appeal under Section 37 of the 1996 Act. This amount was withdrawn by the award holder, and the issue before this Court was whether interest is payable on the deposited amount even after the date of deposit. The Court held as follows: “21. In the present case, the appellate court, on the appeal preferred under Section 37 of the Act did grant stay, subject to the condition that the appellant 53 [2006] Supp. 7 SCR 422 : (2006) 8 SCC 457 54 ibid, para 14. 55 ibid, paras 15, 25 and 26. 56 KL Suneja v. Dr Manjeet Kaur Monga (2023) 6 SCC 722, para 36. 57 [2022] 14 SCR 446 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1736 318 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports would deposit 50% of the amount. Rs. 7,78.280/- was deposited by the appellant on 05.11.2001. The stay, therefore, only operated for the balance amount. On the balance amount, certainly, the appellant would be liable to pay interest @ the rate of 18% per annum till the date of actual payment. However, on Rs. 7,78,280/- paid, after adjusting/appropriating payment due on the interest accrued, on the balance principal amount paid to the respondent, interest would not be payable. 24. The respondent submits that the payment of Rs.
