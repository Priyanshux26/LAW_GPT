Act – Both the complaints were filed against three accused persons including appellant herein (accused no.3) – Appellant sought to quash criminal proceedings against her u/s. 482 Cr.P.C, however the same was dismissed by the High Court – Propriety: Held: On perusal of the complaint, it is clear that the only allegation against the present appellant is that she and the accused No.2 had no intention to pay the dues that they owe to the complainant – It is stated that the 2nd accused and the 3rd accused (appellant herein) are the Directors, promoters of the 1st accused being the Company – It is further averred that the 2nd accused is the authorized signatory, who is in-charge of and responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the Company, i.e., the 1st accused – It can be clearly seen that there is no averment to the effect that the present appellant is in-charge of and responsible for the day-to-day affairs * Author 648 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
