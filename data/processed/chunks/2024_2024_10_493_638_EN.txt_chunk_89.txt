Digital Supreme Court Reports their education, vocational training and skill development, etc.”279 The Ministry also indicated that as “Prison” is a “State” subject, “it is for the respective State Governments to make use of the guidance provided in the Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023 and enact a suitable legislation on Prisons in their jurisdictions for bringing improvement in prison management and administration of prisoners.”280 210. The Model Act does not contain a reference to the prohibition of caste-based discrimination. This is concerning because the Act empowers the officer-in-charge of the prison to “utilize the services of prisoners” for “administration and management of the prisons”.281 Further, disabling from labour and continuously refusing to work is a prison offence.282 The officer-in-charge should not be given the liberty to discriminate against any group of prisoners on the basis of caste. While the Model Prison Manual 2016 refers to the prohibition of caste discrimination in prisons in several provisions, the Model Act of 2023 has completely avoided any such mention. A provision to that effect should be inserted in the Model Act. It should ban segregation or division of work based on caste. 211. The definition of “Habitual Offender” under Section 2(12) is also problematic. It states that, “Habitual Offender means a prisoner who is committed to prison repeatedly for a crime”. The phrase “committed to prison repeatedly” is vague and over-broad. It can be used to declare anyone as a habitual offender, even if they have not been convicted for a crime. The Model Act also provides that “habitual offenders” may be housed in a high security prison.283 In addition to the category of habitual offender, the Act creates a category of “recidivist”, which means “any prisoner who is convicted for a crime more than once”.284 “Habitual/recidivist prisoners” may be classified 279 Unstarred Question No. 3007 (Lok Sabha, dated 8 August 2023), available at https://www.mha.gov.in/ MHA1/Par2017/pdfs/par2023-pdfs/LS-08082023/3007.pdf 280 Ibid 281 Section 60, Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023 282 Ibid, Section 39(v) and (vi) 283 Section 2(15), Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023 284 Ibid, Section 2(29) [2024] 10 S.C.R. 625 Sukanya Shantha v. Union of India & Ors. separately and segregated in prisons.285 212. Chapter IX of the Model Act, dealing with “Protection of Society from Criminal Activities of High-Risk Prisoners, Habitual Offenders and Hardened Criminals”, also seems to be over-broad. Section 27(1) states that the society needs to be protected from “habitual offenders, along with high-risk prisoners, and hardened criminals. The said category is prohibited for “parole, furlough, or any kind of prison leave in the normal course”.286 The Act provides that “the release of a high-risk/hardened/habitual offender convict on completion of sentence or an under-trial on bail or an inmate released temporarily on parole/furlough, etc. shall be informed to the Superintendent of Police of the concerned district, who shall keep a watch on the activities of such prisoners”.287 This provision gives wide powers to the police, which may be misused.
