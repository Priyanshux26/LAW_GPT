If such an assumption is allowed, it would considerably broaden the canvas of the incentives available under the 2003 Policy, which was never intended. In fact, such a loose interpretation of the State policies would lead to an ambiguity to the State’s intent and render it opposite to the public policy. 24. In view of the aforesaid, holding that the exemption from Market fees is inclusive of Rural Development fees shall be contrary to the statutory provisions and objective behind both the Acts as well as the 2003 Policy. Thereby, the two fees cannot be equated or assumed to be same or similar for the purposes of exemption. Effect of communication made by the State via various notes/ letters 25. As mentioned before, the Respondent has heavily relied on letters dated 09.10.2001, 28.08.2001 and 10.09.2001 published by the Department of Agriculture to seek such an exemption. The Appellant has submitted before us that the letter dated 28.08.2001 was only issued by the office Superintendent in the Appellant’s office and was not a decision by the Government and has consequently been withdrawn as not being an authorized letter vide letter dated 02.11.2010. 26. It is apparent that the letter dated 02.11.2010 has been issued by the Department of Agriculture and duly withdrew the Note dated 09.10.2001. With regard to the Respondent’s argument that the letter dated 28.08.2001 still remains applicable as not explicitly withdrawn, we note that the Memo dated 09.10.2001 itself referred and relied upon Note dated 28.08.2001 and, hence, any subsequent communication withdrawing Memo dated 09.10.2001 shall ipso [2024] 7 S.C.R. 755 State of Punjab & Ors. v. M/s Punjab Spintex Ltd. facto apply to the earlier referred letters as well including the note dated 28.08.2001. 27. In furtherance, the Department of Agriculture has also issued a Memo dated 21.02.2011 to clarify and reiterate that when exemption from Market fees is granted, as in the instant case, such exemption will not be automatically applicable on Rural Development fee. Therefore, the Respondent’s reliance on such earlier letters, improper as they were, will not help them claim exemption from Rural Development fee. 28. From an in-depth analysis of the statutes and policies produced before us, it is apparent that no unit, other than those approved as Mega Project, has been allowed exemption from the payment of Rural Development fee, unless explicitly provided by the authorities. The Respondent herein, M/s Punjab Spintex Limited, has admittedly not been approved as a Mega Project and, therefore, not eligible for such exemption from Rural Development fee. Conclusion 29. We accordingly hold that the Market fees and Rural Development fees are distinct and, there being no exemption from Rural Development fees mentioned in the 2003 Policy, it only encompasses exemption from Market fees in its ambit. The two fees under the two different statutory frameworks cannot be equated as one by the Respondent and they cannot assume that exemption from “Market fees” would subsume in itself “Rural Development fees” also. 30. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed.
