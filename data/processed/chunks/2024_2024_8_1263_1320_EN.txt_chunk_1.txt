[Paras 32.2, 32.3, 32.5, 32.6, 32.12] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Whether the appellant was justified in alleging that the subject property was under-valued: Held: If the appellant was so confident that the subject property would have fetched a much higher price, nothing precluded him from identifying a bidder who was willing to offer a better price – In fact, such a suggestion was made by the Liquidator in his reply dated 15.11.2019 to the objection taken by the appellant to the estimated value of the subject property in his letter dated 08.11.2019 – Again, the Liquidator wrote a letter dated 27.11.2019 to the appellant suggesting that ask eligible parties willing to offer a better price to participate in the auction process – The appellant did not follow up after that – Therefore, the appellant [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1265 V.S. Palanivel v. P. Sriram, CS, Liquidator, Etc. cannot be permitted to argue that since the tax value of the subject property was estimated by the Registered Valuers at above ₹48 crores, the Liquidator ought not to have fixed the reserve price at ₹39,41,28,500/- for the simple reason that though the reports of the Registered Valuers mentioned the tax value of the subject property at a little above ₹48 crores, but the liquidation value in both the reports was much lower and the Liquidator arrived at the average of the two estimated liquidation values to fix the reserve price of the subject property. [Paras 33.5, 33.6] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 31A – Whether it was incumbent for the Liquidator to constitute a Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee: Held: By virtue of the Notification dated 28.04.2022, an Explanation was appended at the foot of Regulation 31A which clarifies that the requirement of constituting a Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee shall apply only to those liquidation processes that were to commence on/after the date of commencement of the IBBI Regulation, 2016 – In the present case, the liquidation process in respect of the company had commenced on 17.07.2019 and therefore, the submission made by the appellant that the Liquidator has breached Regulation 31A of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 by not constituting a Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee, is devoid of merits – That apart, the record reveals, that the Liquidator had sent a reply on 15.11.2019 to a written objection taken by the appellant on the Valuation reports submitted by the Registered Valuers on 08.11.2019, wherein, it was stated that neither he nor the other ex-Directors of the company had responded to the Liquidator’s suggestion for calling a meeting of the CoC – Despite this, neither the appellant nor the other ex-Directors of the company took any step to depute a person from amongst them to be a part of the Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee – In view of the aforesaid facts, the objection taken by the appellant that the Liquidator has breached Regulation 31A, does not hold any water –Nor is the Court inclined to examine the submission made at the instance of the appellant that in the absence of any explanation appended to Regulation 31A as it stood before 25.07.2019, it was incumbent for the Liquidator to have constituted a Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee.
