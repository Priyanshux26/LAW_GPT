No.62 of 2020. The NCLAT has also observed that the appellants have not lent any money to the Corporate Debtor and the Corporate Debtor did not owe any financial debt to the appellants except the pledge of shares was to be executed. C Therefore, the NCLT observed that the appellants not having advanced any money to the Corporate Debtor as a financial debt would not be coming within the purview of financial creditor of the Corporate Debtor. Making above observations, the NCLAT has dismissed the appeal. 2.5 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned D and passed by the NCLAT dismissing the appeal and confirming the appeal passed by the Revenue dismissing I.A.No.62 of 2020, the original applicants – M/s Vistra and others have preferred the present appeal. 3. Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Advocate has appeared E on behalf of the appellant in C.A. No.3606 of 2020 and Shri Shyam Divan, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant in C.A. No.6372-73 of 2021. Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General has appeared on behalf of the respondent no.1 – CoC. 3.1 Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants F have vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the NCLT/NCLAT have materially erred in observing that the claim made by the appellant no.1 as a secured financial creditor was belated. It is submitted on behalf of the appellants that both the NCLT as well as NCLAT have not properly appreciated the fact that it was a continuing G cause of action. So, it was a case of continuing cause of action. It is submitted under the IBC that there is no limitation prescribed for objecting to the categorization of the creditors in a wrongful category. 3.2 It is submitted that the ratio of the limitation is connected with the principle of cause of action. H 816 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 3.3 It is submitted that it is a case of continuous cause of action as resolution professional, CoC, Resolution Applicant and the Adjudicating Authority are all required to consider the correct categorization of the claimants. 3.4 It is submitted that in the present case, the corporate insolvency B resolution process (“CIRP”) commenced on 24.07.2017 and the present resolution plan (which as per the Adjudicating Authority’s dated 09.07.2020) was submitted for voting by the CoC from 07.02.2020 to 11.02.2020; which was only approved by the Adjudicating Authority on 09.07.2020 i.e., almost 3 years since the start of the CIRP. The Appellants had already challenged the non-inclusion of the Appellants as a financial C secured creditor in the CoC on 11.02.2020, which was 5 months before the resolution plan was approved by the Adjudicating Authority. Therefore, the question of delay on the part of the Appellants does not arise and neither can delay be agitated by the Respondents since the CIRP process under the supervision of the Resolution Professional and CoC itself carried D on for 3 years, which 3 years is well beyond the timeline of 330 days as set out under the IBC.
