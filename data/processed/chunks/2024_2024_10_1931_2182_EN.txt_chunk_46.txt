Justice SB Sinha in his dissenting opinion, considered the scope of the words ‘that is to say’ in Entry 8 of List II. Relying on the decisions in CST v. Popular Trading101 and Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (Appeals),102 the learned Judge held that the expression ‘that is to say’ in Entry 8 of List II is descriptive, enumerative and exhaustive and circumscribes the scope of the said entry to a great extent.”103 However, the opinion did not consider the decisions in Bhola Prasad (supra) and State 98 State of Karnataka v. Balaji Computers; Bansal Wire Industries v. State of UP (2011) 6 SCC 545 [20]; Sait Rikhaji Furtarnal v. State of AP (1991) Supp (1) SCC 202 [4]; CST v. Popular Trading Company (2005) 5 SCC 511 99 (1954) 2 SCC 152; “12. […] He points out that one of the meanings of the word “namely” as given in Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. VII, p. 16 is “that is to say” and he then refers us to the decision of the Federal Court in Bhola Prasad v. King Emperor [Bhola Prasad v. King Emperor, 1942 SCC OnLine FC 3 : (1942) 4 FCR 17 at p. 25] where it was stated that the words “that is to say” were explanatory or illustrative words and not words either of amplification or limitation. It should, however, be remembered that those observations were made in connection with one of the legislative heads, namely, Entry 31 of the Provincial Legislative List. The fundamental proposition enunciated in R. v. Burah [R. v. Burah (1878) LR 3 AC 889 (PC)] was that Indian Legislatures within their own sphere had plenary powers of legislation as large and of the same nature as those of Parliament itself. In that view of the matter every entry in the legislative list had to be given the widest connotation and it was in that context that the words “that is to say”, relied upon by the learned Attorney General, were interpreted in that way by the Federal Court. To do otherwise would have been to cut down the generality of the legislative head itself. The same reason cannot apply to the construction of the Government in the present case for the considerations that applied in the case before the Federal Court have no application here.” [emphasis supplied] 100 (2004) 11 SCC 26 101 [2000] 2 SCR 983 : (2000) 5 SCC 511 102 [2001] 1 SCR 407 : (2001) 2 SCC 201 103 (2001) 2 SCC 201 [158] 1994 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of Bombay v. Bombay Education Society104 and instead referred to the interpretation of the expression in taxing statutes. For the above reasons, the expression ‘that is to say’ in Entry 8 of List II cannot be interpreted to circumscribe the scope of the entry. The words that follow ‘that is to say’ are illustrative and explanatory of the scope of the provision. The expression does not limit the scope of the entry.
