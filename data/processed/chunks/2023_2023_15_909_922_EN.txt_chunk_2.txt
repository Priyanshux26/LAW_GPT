Subsequently, two Tripartite Agreements were signed between Shivkumar Daga (hereinafter referred to as ‘SD’), Madhurkumar Ramakrishnaji Bajaj & Ors. (hereinafter referred to as ‘MB’) and M/s. Emerald Acres Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as ‘EAPL’) to develop, trade, and deal with the property and also to acquire such further properties as may be mutually agreed between the parties. Both the Tripartite Agreements dated 31.03.2007 and 25.07.2008 contain the following arbitration clause: “It is agreed between Parties that in the event of any disputes or diff erences between the Parties hereto in relation to this Agreement or in relation to any matter touching or arising from this Agreement, the parties shall refer such disputes and diff erences to the arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 or any statutory modifi cation thereof.” 3. Shivkumar Daga died on 08.05.2011, bequeathing his assets through a will dated 10.02.2011 to his wife (appellant no. 1) and his son (appellant no. 2), in which a probate petition has already been fi led and as per the records before us the case is still pending. 4. The appellants i.e., SD’s wife and his son then fi led a suit seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the Deed of Conveyance dated 17.12.2019 be declared null and void, and that the Development Agreements entered into pursuant to the two Tripartite Agreements be declared validly terminated. 5. The Conveyance Deed dated 17.12.2019 sought to be declared void and the fi ve Development Agreements dated 17.09.2007, 20.11.2007, 30.11.2007, 03.12.2007 and 27.02.2008 sought to be declared as validly terminated by the appellants, all fi nd their source in the two Tripartite Agreements dated 31.03.2007 and 25.07.2008. 6. The fi rst prerequisite for an application under Section 8, of an arbitration agreement being there in the 2007 and 2008 Tripartite agreements cannot be denied, as all the other Development Agreements fi nd their source in the aforesaid two Tripartite Agreements. The Trial Court and the High SUSHMA SHIVKUMAR DAGA & ANR. v. MADHURKUMAR 913 RAMKRISHNAJI BAJAJ & ORS [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] Court have rightly held that the broad language of the “arbitration clause” in the two Tripartite Agreements dated 31.03.2007 and 25.07.2008 would cover the dispute raised by the appellants before the Civil Court, and hence the case has been rightly referred for arbitration. 7. The role of a ‘Court’ is now in any case, extremely limited in arbitration matters. The underlying principles of arbitration as contained in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, was always to have as little interference as possible by a judicial authority. Section 5 of the Arbitration Act reads as under: 5. Extent of judicial intervention.— Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part. Major amendments were made in the Arbitration Act in the year 2015, inter alia, both in Section 8 and Section 11 of the Act, in to further reduce any chances of judicial interference and now the amended Section 8 of the Arbitration Act reads as under: 8.
