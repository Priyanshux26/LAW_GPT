Accordingly, the appellant has been enlarged on bail. SUBMISSIONS 7. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant has taken us through various s of the High Court. He pointed out that the application 984 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports for cancellation of bail was listed on 24 to 25 dates from 23rd June 2023 to July 2024. One learned Single Judge, after reserving the , recused himself. After that, two other learned Single Judges recused themselves. His submission is that the granting bail was casually stayed by the High Court on 23rd June 2023 without examining the merits of the case and without recording any reasons. He submitted that if the benefit of the granting bail is allowed to be taken away by such a cryptic of interim stay passed without application of mind, it will violate the liberty guaranteed to the appellant under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 8.

He pointed out that the same learned Special Judge had rejected the regular bail application made by the appellant by the dated 10th March 2023, and only after three months, on 17th June 2023, the same learned Judge granted bail though there was no change in circumstances. He submitted that in view of this position, the High Court was justified in granting the interim stay on 23rd June 2023. CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS GROUNDS FOR CANCELLATION OF BAIL 9.
