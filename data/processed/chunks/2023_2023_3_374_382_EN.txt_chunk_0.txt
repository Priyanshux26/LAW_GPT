It is a fact to be noticed and taken care of that large A chunk of land is acquired for planned development to take care of immediate need and also keep buffer for future requirements. Such portion of land may be lying vacant also. As has been observed in Indore Development Authority’s case by this court, the State agencies are not supposed to put police force to protect B possession of the land taken after process of acquisition is complete. As far as the case in hand is concerned, the land even if lying vacant, is required now for a project of national importance. [Para 13][382-B-D] 3. It is the undisputed fact on the record, as has been noticed C in the impugned passed by the High Court, the possession of the land was taken over by the Land Acquisition Collector and handed over to Delhi Development Authority.
