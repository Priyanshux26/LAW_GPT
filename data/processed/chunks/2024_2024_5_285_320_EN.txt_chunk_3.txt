The Insured also pleaded that since the running of the company was important, it got a 6 Hi Cold Rolling Mill installed in its unit and commenced production by spending Rs.29.60 crores apart from excise duties. 10. Admittedly, based on the interim report of the surveyors, a sum of Rs.4,92,80,905/- was released in favour of the Insured by NIACL on 24.03.1999. According to the Insured, after the release of the amount, it placed an with ‘M/s Flat Products Equipments (India) Limited’ [“M/s Flat Products”] for reinstating the 20 Hi Cold Rolling machine by replacing the totally damaged and partially damaged parts for a total sum of Rs.25 crores, and paid Rs.3,75,00,000/- to M/s Flat Products by way of advance payment. Further, a sum of Rs.47.50 lacs on account of inspection charges of mill housing and Rs. 25 lacs for transportation of mill housing were also paid. According to the Insured, though it lost more than Rs. 25 crores, in view of the persistence from the Insurance Company, vide letter dated 16.06.1999, it gave consent for receiving Rs.20.95 Crores as net adjusted loss to avoid loss of time. 11. According to the Insured, since no response was forthcoming and the balance amount was not released, Consumer Complaint bearing Case No. 233 of 2000 was filed by the Insured before the NCDRC on 30.05.2000. 12. According to NIACL, after receipt of the information about the fire accident on 12.12.1998, NIACL immediately appointed the surveyors and soon thereafter, on the basis of the interim survey report, on- account payments were made. The Joint Surveyors submitted their report on 11.12.2001. The vigilance complaints were also closed on 18.01.2002. 13. According to NIACL, it was only on 27.03.2002 that the Insured informed NIACL about the fact of having already installed a new 6 Hi Cold Rolling Mill and requested them for joint inspection with the surveyors. In the Joint Surveyors’ Report of 11.12.2001, the loss was assessed at Rs.19.55 crores on replacement basis and Rs.13.51 crores on depreciation basis. The surveyors, on 03.05.2002, requested the Complainant to furnish several information for which there was no response. It was contended by NIACL that the plea of the Insured in their letter of 27.03.2002 that it had placed an for cold rolling mill on 11.01.1999 and the same was installed in [2024] 5 S.C.R. 291 New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v. M/s Tata Steel Ltd. September-October, 1999 at the cost of Rs. 31.37 crores and the prayer that the replacement should be treated as reinstatement, is completely unacceptable. The machine installed is 6 Hi Cold Rolling as against the damaged mill which was 20 Hi Cold Rolling. According to NIACL, the claim has been rightly settled at Rs.7.88 Crores. Proceedings before the NCDRC: 14. Though several other points were argued before us by the Insured, the point canvassed before the NCDRC [and pleaded in the Insured’s connected Appeals] related only to the calculation of depreciation.
