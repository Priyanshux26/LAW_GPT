5. Challenging the of the High Court, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that in view of the notification 08.10.1985, issued by the State in exercise of powers under section 8(2) of the 1913 Act, the suit filed by the respondents deserved to be dismissed as the right of preemption did not exist for sale of land falling in the areas of any municipality in Haryana. It is not a matter of dispute that the sale in question was pertaining to the property located within the municipal limits of Jagadhri (State of Haryana). In terms of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Shyam Sunder and others v. Ram Kumar and another7, the right of pre-emption has to exist on the date of registration of the sale-deed, on the date of filing of suit and also on the date the same is decreed by the first Court. In the case in hand, no doubt, the suit was pending when the aforesaid notification was issued, however, the Trial Court had decided the same on 27.05.1989, hence the decree could not have been passed. The courts below have failed to appreciate that aspect of the matter. 6. He further submitted that the sale deed was registered in favour of the appellants on 25.01.1983, the suit having been filed on 25.01.1984 was time-barred as the limitation thereof is one year, which expired on 24.01.1984. It was further argued that the courts below have wrongly appreciated the issue regarding the custom of pre-emption prevailing in the area. It was not a matter of dispute that the area in which the property is situated, falls within the extended area of municipal limits of Jagadhri. Though some 5 The Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913 6 Sale-deed dated 25.01.1983 7 [2001] 1 Suppl. SCR 115 : (2001) 8 SCC 24 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 127 Jagmohan and Another v. Badri Nath and Others evidence was led pertaining to the custom prevailing in the urban area of municipal limits of Jagadhri, however, for the extended area, no evidence was produced. In terms of the of the High Court in Sandeep Bansal v. M. L. Hans and others8, decided on 24.08.2009, the same custom cannot be relied upon for any transaction of sale in the extended area. 7. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that though issue of limitation was raised by the appellants before the Trial Court, however, the same was not seriously contested for the reason that the suit filed by the respondents was within limitation. The Schedule attached to the 1963 Act9 provides for a period of one year for filing of suit for pre-emption. If the same is read along with Section 12 of the aforesaid Act, in terms of which the date of registration of sale deed is to be excluded, the suit filed by the respondents was within limitation. It was for this reason that the appellants did not press the aforesaid issue before the lower Appellate Court10 or the High Court.
