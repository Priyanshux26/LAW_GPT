All these are charges under the H GMR WARORA ENERGY LTD. v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY 191 REGULATORY COMMISSION (CERC) Notifications issued by the Indian Railways, through the Railway A Board. As such, no error can be found with the finding of the learned APTEL that they would amount to ‘Change in Law’ events. Insofar as levy of ‘Forest Tax’ is concerned, the same is levied by the State Government under the statutory provisions. In that view of the matter, there is no reason to interfere with the B of the learned APTEL. The appeals are, accordingly, liable to be dismissed. [Paras 138, 139, 141][232-F-G; 233-A] 12. Civil Appeal Nos. 2935-2936 of 2020 In addition to the ‘Change in Law’ benefits granted by the State Commission, ‘Coal Terminal Surcharge’, ‘Chhattisgarh C Paryavaran Upkar’ and ‘Chhattisgarh Vikas Upkar’ were also considered to be ‘Change in Law’ events by the learned APTEL. The ‘Coal Terminal Surcharge’ was levied by the Indian Railways subsequent to the cut-off date. Similarly, the Government of Chhattisgarh, under Section 8 of the Chhattisgarh Adhosanrachna D Vikas Evam Paryavaran Upkar Adhiniyam, 2005, vide Notification dated 16th June 2015, which is admittedly after the cut-off date, introduced ‘Chhattisgarh Paryavaran Upkar’ and ‘Chhattisgarh Vikas Upkar’. Even the Change in Swacch Bharat Cess at the rate of 0.5% on Service Tax for Operation Period and Change in Krishi Kalyan Cess at the rate of 5% on Service Tax for Operation E Period, which had beengranted concurrently by the State Commission and the learned APTEL, were notified by the Union of India after the cut-off date. It could thus be seen that all these additional taxes or cesses were introduced by the instrumentalities of the Government of India or by the F Government of Chhattisgarh. The same are issued under the provisions of the concerned statutes, rules, notifications, s, etc. It is thus clear that they would amount to ‘Law’ within the meaning of the term ‘Law’ as defined in the PPAs. As such, no error can be found with the of the learned APTEL. There is no merit in the appeals. The appeals are, accordingly, liable to G be dismissed. [Paras 142 – 145][232-B-F] 13. Civil Appeal No. 3123 of 2019 and Civil Appeal No.5372 of 2019 H 192 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A In the present matter, in addition to the claims granted by the CERC, the learned APTEL also granted the following claims: (i) Change in NCDP (cancellation of Captive Block vis-à-vis tapering linkage), (ii) Busy Season Surcharge and Developmental Surcharge, (iii) Carrying Cost; and (iv) Add on Premium Price. Insofar as other claims which were concurrently allowed and B disallowed by the CERC and the learned APTEL are concerned, in view of the concurrent findings, there is no reason to interfere with the same. The appeals of both DISCOMS as well as Generating Companies are, therefore, liable to be dismissed. [Paras 146, 151, 152][233-G-H; 234-A, E-F] C 14. Civil Appeal No. 6641 of 2019 This appeal is filed by GKEL, being aggrieved by the concurrent denial of benefits on certain components.
