Conclusion:......................................................................... 22 Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J. 1. Introduction: “The following two questions arose for our consideration; i) Whether there is a liability to pay customs duty when the confiscated goods are redeemed after payment of fine under Section 125 of the Customs Act, 1962?1 ii) Whether, the liability to pay such duty will include the liability to pay interest on delayed payment under Section 28AB of the Act? Adjudication of these questions brought to light certain seemingly contradictory decisions on this question, and this 1 Hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’. * Ed. Note: Pagination as per the original . 1186 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports requires us to reflect on the correct ratio of the decision of this Court in Commr. of Customs (Import) v. Jagdish Cancer and Research Centre.2 Therefore, the third question that fell for our consideration is; iii) What is the true and correct ratio of the decision in Jagdish Cancer case?” 1.1. For the reasons to follow, we have held that the owner of goods has a liability to pay customs duty, even after confiscated goods are redeemed after payment of fine under Section 125 of the Act. Furthermore, when confiscation proceedings are initiated under Section 124 of the Act, the obligation to pay duty and other charges under Section 125 will arise only when the owner of goods exercises the option to pay fine for redemption of goods and the Department accepts it.
