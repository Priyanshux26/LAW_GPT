Urmila Devi expired on 18.05.2007. On her demise Mr. Manoj Kumar Jain fi led an application on 17.05.2008 for substitution as her legal heir and claiming right legatee under the Will dated 19.05.1999. This application was followed by an affi davit of the appellant (Yashpal Jain) dated 25.10.2008 stating thereunder that his mother Urmila Devi had executed a Will dated 19.05.1999 in favour of Manoj Kumar Jain and also stating thereunder that Will was duly registered. The legal heirs of the defendant objected the said substitution contending, inter alia, that the present appellant is the adopted son of Urmila Devi and said adoption deed was duly registered on 06.01.1973 in the offi ce of the Sub-Registrar.
