It is that question with reference to Section 143A, NI Act, that was answered as above in the decision in Shri Gurudatta Sugars Marketing Pvt. Ltd.’s case (surpa). In view of the analogicalness of Section 143A to Section 148, that both the provisions are under the same Act though applicable at different stage of proceedings under Section 138 of NI Act and that the proviso to Section 148(1) makes it abundantly clear that deposit under Section 148(1) of the NI Act shall be an additional compensation paid by the appellant under Section 143A thereof, it can only be said that the decision in Shri Gurudatta Sugars Marketing Pvt. Ltd.’s case (supra) is applicable to the extent it holds an officer of a company who is an authorised signatory of the cheque issued by a company is not the drawer of the same subject to what is held in the said decision with reference to Section 141, NI Act, as relates Section 148 thereof. 16. To wit, as in the case of the position qua Section 143A, NI Act, merely because an officer of a company concerned is the authorised signatory of the cheque concerned by itself will not make such an officer ‘drawer of the cheque’ under Section 148, NI Act, so as to empower the Appellate Court, in an appeal against conviction for an offence under Section 138, NI Act, to direct to deposit compensation of any sum under Section 148(1), of the NI Act. 17. In the decision in ‘Jamboo Bhandari v. Madhya Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation Limited and Ors.4’ this Court held that an Appellate Court in an appeal against conviction under Section 138, NI Act, could not place a condition to deposit an amount 4 (2023) 10 SCC 446 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1901 Bijay Agarwal v. M/s Medilines invoking the power under Section 148(1), NI Act, mechanically without considering whether the case falls within exceptional circumstances. In view of the said exposition of law, the Appellate Court ought to have considered the aforesaid aspects as it would certainly be an exceptional circumstance to exempt the appellant who is not the ‘drawer’ of the cheque concerned to deposit the amount payable under Section 148(1) by an appellant who is the ‘drawer’ of the cheque. In the case on hand, the High Court has failed to consider these crucial aspects in the light of the dictum laid down by this Court in the decisions referred supra while considering the application for suspension of sentence for the conviction under Section 138 of the NI Act in the pending appeal. 18. The upshot of the discussion is that these appeals should succeed and consequently, it is allowed. The impugned common dated 09.01.2024 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in Criminal Petition Nos.13095/2023 and 13153/2023 is set aside. Accordingly, the s dated 10.11.2023 passed by the Principal City Civil & Sessions Judge at Bangalore respectively in Criminal Appeal No. 1537/2023 and 1536/2023 stands quashed and set aside to the extent it put the condition to deposit of 20% of the fine amount payable under s in CC Nos.13937/2023 and 13938/2013, passed by the Court of XXXVI Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore City and restore the s dated 10.11.2023 suspending the sentence of the appellant in both the cases, with the condition(s) imposed qua execution of bond and on such execution it will remain in force till the disposal of the above mentioned appeals pending before the First Appellate Court concerned.
