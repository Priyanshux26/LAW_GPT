142 Subramanian Swamy v. Raju (2014) 8 SCC 390, para 63. 1082 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports demonstrate maturity, suggesting that age requirements should, therefore, be flexible under Article 14. While rejecting this argument, the Court held that categorization does not have to create classes with arithmetic precision, and instead, it would suffice if the classes are broadly comparable. 183. Having identified the criteria for evaluating the constitutionality of classifications, we can now proceed to analyse whether Section 6A is constitutionally valid. Reasonableness of classification as per Section 6A 184. To assess the reasonableness of the classification made by Section 6A, it is imperative to delve into the background of this provision. 185. As discussed earlier, Section 6A grants citizenship to those who migrated from East Pakistan into India before 25.03.1971. This grant of citizenship was prompted by several factors, with two primary considerations: (a) First, as exemplified by the remarks in the Parliament during the discussion on the bill to introduce Section 6A, humanitarian concerns played a significant role in granting citizenship because it was deemed inhumane to repatriate thousands of people who had migrated during times of war. (b) Second, considerations of inter-state relations were pivotal, as India sought to extend cooperation to the newly formed nation of Bangladesh and help it in restoring normalcy. As part of this understanding, it was agreed to grant citizenship in India to immigrants who arrived before 1971.143 186. The pertinent question that arises now is why such citizenship was granted exclusively to immigrants entering Assam. As acknowledged by the Union of India in its affidavit, the issue of immigration also existed in West Bengal. Therefore, if individuals from Bangladesh were immigrating to other States as well, we must ask what criteria justified conferring citizenship solely in Assam. 187. The answer to this question lies in history, specifically when Section 6A was enacted. Between 1980 and 1985, the Government of India 143 Bholanath Sen, Lok Sabha Debate (CAB, 1985), 20.11.1985. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1083 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 engaged in extensive negotiations with representatives of various bodies in Assam. Eventually, an agreement was reached among the Government of Assam, the Government of India, the AASU, and the AAGSP. According to this agreement, the movement’s representatives against foreigners in Assam agreed to call off the agitation in exchange for granting Indian Citizenship to only a limited category of immigrants in Assam. As a result, the government also extended benefits to those involved in the agitation and committed to focusing on the socio-economic development of Assam, with particular emphasis on building educational institutions. Known as the Assam Accord, this agreement represented a political compromise that specifically granted citizenship to immigrants in Assam based on the terms agreed upon in the Accord. 188. Section 6A was inserted to advance this political settlement established through the Assam Accord. The long title of the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985 captures this by stating that, “Whereas for the purpose of giving effect to certain provisions of the Memorandum of Settlement relating to the foreigners’ issue in Assam (Assam Accord) which was laid down before the House of Parliament on the 10th day of August, 1985 it is necessary to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955.” 189.
