Unlike reinforced papercups, these bags are reusable, recyclable, and capable of some level of biodegradation (based on the composition), but no committee was constituted to looked into it more closely, and it was in fact brought within the scope of the ban subsequently by way of clarifi cation; the ban of this product perhaps deserves further scrutiny. 49. One of the arguments made by the appellants was that the State government should have taken into consideration that the Government of India had by dated 13.12.2018, constituted an expert committee to 115 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. defi ne ‘single use plastics’ in view of the confl icting decisions by various state governments on ban of such products, and that the decision of the steering committee to proceed without waiting for the Union government’s report is arbitrary and prejudicial. Though not applicable to the present lis, it is appropriate to note the amendments that have been made to the central Rules, since. The committee constituted by the Union Government, resulted in the Expert Committee Report on Single Use Plastics dated 19.09.2019 (which led to further amendments in the 2016 Rules). 50. The 2016 Rules were amended in 2018, 2021, and 2022. While the 2022 Amendment26 inserted the defi nition of ‘biodegradable plastics’27 in the Rules, the 2021 Amendment28 to the 2016 Rules, inserted the defi nition for ‘non-woven bags’ and ‘single use plastic commodity’ which read as follows: (na) “Non-woven plastic bag” means Non-woven plastic bag made up of plastic sheet or web structured fabric of entangled plastic fi bers or fi laments (and by perforating fi lms) bonded together by mechanical or thermal or chemical means, and the “non-woven fabric” means a fl at or tufted porous sheet that is made directly from plastic fi bres, molten plastic or plastic fi lms;‟ […] (va) “Single-use plastic commodity” mean a plastic item intended to be used once for the same purpose before being disposed of or recycled;” These defi nitions are similar to the understanding that the State Government of Tamil Nadu employed, in the ban that is the subject of the present case. 26 Plastic Waste Management (Second Amendment) Rules, 2022, G.S.R. 522(E) w.e.f. 06.07.2022. 27 Rule 3(ac) ― “Biodegradable plastic” means plastics, other than compostable plastics, which undergoes degradation by biological processes under ambient environment (terrestrial or in water) conditions, without leaving any micro plastics, or visible, or distinguishable or toxic residue, which has adverse environment impacts, adhering to laid down standards of Bureau of Indian Standards and certifi ed by the Central Pollution Control Board” 28 Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2021 G.S.R. 571(E), w.e.f. 12.08.2021. TAMIL NADU AND PUDUCHERRY PAPER CUP MANUFACTURES 1155 ASSOCIATION v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 51. The 2021 Amendment also included a similar ban of single use plastic commodities w.e.f. 01.07.2022, through an amendment to Rule 4 which inserted sub-clause (2), (3) and (4): “(1) […] (2) The manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of following single use plastic, including polystyrene and expanded polystyrene, commodities shall be prohibited with eff ect from the 1st July, 2022:- (a) ear buds with plastic sticks, plastic sticks for balloons, plastic fl ags, candy sticks, ice-cream sticks, polystyrene [Thermocol] for decoration; (b) plates, cups, glasses, cutlery such as forks, spoons, knives, straw, trays, wrapping or packing fi lms around sweet boxes, invitation cards, and cigarette packets, plastic or PVC banners less than 100 micron, stirrers.
