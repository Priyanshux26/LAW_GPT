In addition, the law’s recognition of the concepts of legitimate and illegitimate children have social repercussions in that illegitimate children are shunned by the society. These intangible benefi ts of marriage indicate that society regards marriage as the primary and sole unit through which familial relationships can be forged. As Marshall CJ observed in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health,127 in a very real sense, there are three partners in a civil marriage: two willing partners and an approving State. 149. There are numerous tangible benefi ts conferred by the State which fl ow from marriage and touch upon every aspect of life. Tangible benefi ts conferred by marriage can be classifi ed into (i) matrimonial and child care related benefi ts; (ii) property benefi ts; (iii) monetary benefi ts; (iv) evidentiary privilege; (v) civic benefi ts; and (vi) miscellaneous benefi ts. 150. Matrimonial and child care related benefi ts include the provisions of permanent alimony and maintenance,128 maintenance if a person with suffi cient means refuses to maintain his wife129, to adopt a child as a couple130, 127 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 20003) 128 Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955; Section 37 of Special Marriage Act 1954 stipulates that the court can direct the husband to pay maintenance to his wife; Section 40 of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act 1936; Section 37 of the Divorce Act 1869 where the District Court is conferred with the power to secure maintenance to the wife from the husband. 129 Section 125 of CrPC 130 Section 57 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015 prescribes eligibility criteria for the adoption of children. The provision stipulates that if a couple wants to adopt, then the consent of both the spouses are required. However, the sub-section (5) of the provision states that any other criteria specifi ed in the adoption regulations frame Authority shall be followed. Clause 5(3) of the Adoption Regulations dated 23.9.2022 (G.S.R. 726(E)) notifi ed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development in exercise of powers conferred under Section 68(c) 132 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. and to avail rights related to surrogacy131. Property benefi ts would include securing a share in case of intestate succession132. Legislation such as Section 16 of the HMA has conferred legitimacy on children born from void or voidable marriages with a consequential right to or in the property of the parents (and not of any other person). Monetary or fi nancial benefi ts which fl ow from marriage include the provisions to be nominated for the payment of gratuity133, to receive funeral expenditure for the deceased spouse, 134 for the payment of medical benefi ts to the spouse of the insured person,135 and to claim provident fund as the dependent of a deceased spouse.136 Additionally, the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961 provide numerous tax benefi ts for payments made on behalf of the spouse. For example, Section 80C of the Income Tax Act 1961 permits deduction of the insurance premia paid for the spouse’s life insurance policy and Section 80D permits deduction of expenses towards the premium of spouses health insurance.
