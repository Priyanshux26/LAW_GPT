Post- conviction behaviour is hardly of any relevance so far as present appeal is concerned. In fact, his post-conviction abnormalities, as dealt with in year 2013 i.e., nearly two years after the impugned G of the Trial Court, cannot even remotely be correlated with the relevant questions arising for the purpose of present appeal. Even in that regard, the report of the Medical Officer (I/ C) Central Jail No. 5, Tihar New Delhi dated 22.07.2013 states that the appellant was admitted to psychiatry ward from 07.01.2013 to 04.03.2013 for complaints of abnormal behaviour but, he H 806 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A improved following treatment and at time of issuance of certificate, his general condition was satisfactory; and his mental status examination did not reveal any gross psychopathology. [Para 28][859-G-H; 860-A-B] 3.7. Hence, viewed from any angle, the contention urged B on behalf of appellant, as to be given the benefit of the provisions meant for a person of unsound mind, cannot be accepted. The said provisions do not enure to the benefit of the appellant from any standpoint. [Para 29][860-C] 3.8. In the given set of facts and circumstances, even when the appellant was shown to be a person taken to excessive C consumption of alcohol, there is nothing on record to show if he did the offending acts in a state of intoxication so as to give rise to a doubt about intention with reference to the principles underlying Section 86 IPC. There is no need to elaborate on this aspect for the same having not been projected in evidence at all. D In other words, the present one is not a case where intent could be ruled out so as to reduce the offence of murder to that of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The suggestions about altering the conviction to Section 304 IPC are also required to be rejected. [Para 30][860-C-E] E Conclusion 4. There is no infirmity in the findings concurrently recorded by the Trial Court and the High Court that the prosecution case is amply established by cogent and convincing chain of circumstances, pointing only to the guilt of the appellant, who caused the death of victim children, his sons, by strangulation F and also caused the evidence of offence to disappear by throwing the dead bodies into the canal. The submissions evolved for the purpose of the present appeal that the appellant be extended the benefit of alleged want of mental capacity also remain baseless and could only be rejected. Therefore, no case for interference G is made out. [Para 31][860-F-G] Pappu v. The State of Uttar Pradesh 2022 SCC OnLine SC 176; Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v.
