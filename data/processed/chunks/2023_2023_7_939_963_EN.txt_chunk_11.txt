Support in this regard was drawn from the earlier s in UP Jal Nigam, Lucknow, and another Vs. Kalra Properties (P) Ltd. [(1996) 3 SCC 124]; Sneh Prabha and others Vs. State of UP and another[(1996) 7 SCC 426]; Union of India Vs. Shivkumar Bhargava and others [(1995) 2 SCC 427]; Meera Sahni D Vs. State (NCT of Delhi) and others [(2008) 9 SCC 177]; V. Chandrasekaran and another Vs. Administrative Officer and others [(2012) 12 SCC 133]; Rajasthan State Industrial Development & Investment Corporation Vs. Subhash Sindhi Co-op. Housing Society, Jaipur [(2013) 5 SCC 427]; and M. Venkatesh and others Vs. Commissioner, Bangalore Development Authority [(2015) 17 SCC E 1]. Be it noted that, in UP Jal Nigam, Lucknow (supra), Meera Sahni (supra) and V. Chandrasekaran (supra), this Court held that such a purchaser could not challenge the acquisition and would, at best, be entitled to receive compensation. 23.As both C.S. Gopalakrishnan and V. Thirunarayanan seek to F assail the validity of the Industrial Purposes Act only in the context of the acquisition proceedings initiated thereunder in relation to the lands purchased by them after issuance of the Public Notice under Section 3(2) thereof, viz., the equivalent of a Notification under Section 4 of the old LA Act, their challenge is tainted and unacceptable in its very G inception. They were both subsequent purchasers and are deemed to be aware of the acquisition proceedings. In that regard, we may note that the original owners of the subject lands raised their objections in response to the Public Notice issued under Section 3(2) in the year 2007, but chose to sell their lands in 2012 and 2013. In any event, neither of these subsequent purchasers can be permitted to claim ignorance of the H 954 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A acquisition proceedings. In effect, the very sale transactions under which they claim title and interest in the subject lands are rendered void in the eye of law. Mere passage of time and publication of the Section 3(1) Notice after their purchase of the lands would not save their sale transactions or vest them with a right to attack the acquisition. In consequence, we find no reason to entertain their challenge to the B Industrial Purposes Act on the grounds of arbitrariness and violation of Article 14 of the Constitution or their consequential challenge to the acquisition proceedings. Civil Appeal Nos. 5692-5693 of 2021 are, therefore, liable to be dismissed on this short ground. 24. Civil Appeal No. 5697 of 2021 et al: K.M. Vittal Babu and C T. Chinnappan assail the common dated 03.07.2019 passed by the Madras High Court, whereby challenge to the validity of the Highways Act, on the grounds of arbitrariness and violation of Article 14 of the Constitution, was rejected. The grievance of these two persons is with regard to the acquisition of their lands by the State of Tamil Nadu under D the Highways Act. The Government of Tamil Nadu had issued GO.Ms.No.200, Highways and Minor Ports Department, dated 07.12.2011, proposing to acquire land for construction of a Flyover/Road over Bridge to replace Railway Level Crossing No.
