She had paid the advance sale consideration of Rs. 4,00,000/-. When the deceased father of the appellants failed to measure and demarcate the land, the question of the Plaintiff (Respondent No. 1 herein) paying the balance sale consideration D does not arise. However, even then the averments of the Plaintiff, her conduct and the testimony of her husband show that the Plaintiff, since the signing of the sale agreement, was ever ready and willing to pay the balance consideration. [Para 30][816-A-D] 2. However, what is to be seen in the present case, is that E the sale agreement dated 14.08.2002 stipulated that the vendor (deceased father of the appellants) was required to get the land measured and demarcated within three months, following which, the purchaser (Respondent No. 1 herein /Plaintiff) was required to pay the balance sale consideration. So, it can be clearly F observed that the performance of the purchaser’s obligation to pay the balance sale consideration within three months is dependent upon the fulfilment of the vendor’s obligation to get the land measured and demarcated within three months. [Para 34][818-G-H; 819-A] 3. Therefore, it can be deduced that unless the vendor got G the subject land measured and demarcated within three months, it would be impossible for the purchaser (Respondent No. 1 herein/Plaintiff) to get a sale deed executed, and as such, the question of paying the balance sale consideration does not arise. H 804 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A This was also observed by the High Court while placing reliance on the recitals in the sale agreement coupled with the evidence of PW1 and PW2. Moreover, as has been held above, it is clear that the vendor (deceased father of the appellants) failed to perform his part of the obligations by getting the subject land measured and demarcated, while the purchaser (Respondent No. B 1 herein/Plaintiff) was ever ready and willing to pay the balance consideration. As such, when specific performance of the terms of the contract has not been done, the question of time being the essence does not arise. [Para 35][819-B-D] Syed Dastagir v. T.R.
