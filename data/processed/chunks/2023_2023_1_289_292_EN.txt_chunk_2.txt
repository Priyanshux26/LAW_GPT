H 292 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 11. In a recent of this Court in Dharmesh v. State of Gujarat1it was opined that it was clear from the plain reading of Section 357 that such compensation can only arise after the conclusion of trial albeit, of course, the same being a matter of discretion. The High Court’s direction to the accused for deposit of compensation for the legal heirs of the deceased (victim), as a condition for the bail cannot be sustained B and, thus, logically set aside. 12. The Court opined that the objective is clear that in cases of offences against body, compensation to the victim should be methodology for redemption. Similarly, to prevent unnecessary harassment, compensation has been provided where meaningless criminal proceedings C had been started. Such a compensation can hardly be determined at the stage of grant of bail. 13. Not being appreciative of such judicial misadventure, we have no hesitation in quashing the condition imposed in the impugned in this behalf while maintaining the other aspects of the grant of anticipatory D bail. 14. The appeal is accordingly allowed leaving parties to bear their own costs. Devika Gujral Appeal allowed. E F G H 1 (2021) 7 SCC 198
