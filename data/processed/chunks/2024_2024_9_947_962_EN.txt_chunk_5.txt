12. Splitting ownership would complicate the tenancy and could not be reasonably executed. 5.6 The Court held that the sale deed dated 27.09.1993 executed in favour of Defendant Nos. 9 to 11 was valid and binding. The appellants were bona fide purchasers who had completed the transaction with all rightful owners, including Defendant Nos. 6 to 8. The plaintiffs’ prior agreement did not create any interest in the property that could invalidate the appellants’ title. Recognizing that the plaintiffs had paid ₹70,000 as earnest money, the Court ed that they were entitled to a refund of this amount with pendente lite and future interest at 6% per annum from Defendant Nos. 1 to 5 (the legal heirs of late Soumendra included). 6. Aggrieved by the Trial Court’s , the plaintiffs filed a first appeal before the High Court of Orissa. On appeal, the High Court reversed the Trial Court’s and decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiffs. It held that the General Power of Attorney dated 30.12.1982 was valid and conferred authority upon Defendant No. 1 to act on behalf of Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, rejecting the notion that it was impliedly revoked by the partition deed dated 17.02.1988. The High Court found that the alleged revocation of the GPA was forged and not genuine. It concluded that the agreement dated 06.06.1993 was valid and enforceable against all defendants, including the sisters, and that the plaintiffs were always ready and [2024] 9 S.C.R. 955 Janardan Das & Ors. v. Durga Prasad Agarwalla & Ors. willing to perform their part of the contract. Consequently, the High Court granted specific performance of the contract, directing all defendants, including Defendant Nos. 9 to 11 (appellants herein), to execute the sale deed in favour of the plaintiffs upon payment of the balance consideration. 7. Aggrieved by the and decree of the High Court, the appellants (Defendant Nos. 9 to 11) have preferred the present appeal before this Court. Having heard the learned counsel for both parties and perused the records, the following main issues arise for determination: I. Whether the plaintiffs proved their continuous readiness and willingness to perform their part of the contract as mandated under Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. II. Whether the agreement to sell dated 06.06.1993 was valid and enforceable against Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, considering that Defendant No. 1 lacked the authority to act on their behalf without a valid and subsisting General Power of Attorney. III. Whether the relief of specific performance, being discretionary, having been denied by the Trial Court was rightly granted by the High Court in the facts and circumstances of the present case. I. Readiness and Willingness of the Plaintiffs to Perform the Contract 8. Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, mandates that a plaintiff seeking specific performance of a contract must aver and prove that they have performed or have always been ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the contract which are to be performed by them.
