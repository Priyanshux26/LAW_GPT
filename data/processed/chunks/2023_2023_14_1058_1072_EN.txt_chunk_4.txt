connection with FIR 205/2017. They were subsequently released on bail, which posed an imminent threat to the Complainant’s life at the hands of Respondent No. 1, and his associates like Chinnaswamy who had criminal antecedents. 9. The Complainant left no stone unturned and made yet another elaborate complaint reiterating the abovementioned allegations to the Chief Minister of Karnataka on 30.10.2019. Additionally, a women’s organisation also came forward and made a complaint alleging collusion of the police offi cials of Vyalikaval Police Station with Respondent No. 1 stating expressly that the local police was ‘inactive’ for extraneous considerations. 10. It is also discernible from the contents of all the complaints that the son born from wedlock continued in the sole custody of the Complainant while Respondent No. 1 unabatedly kept on harassing the Complainant and pressurising her to agree to a mutual divorce. 11. On the ill-fated day, i.e., 21.12.2019, the Complainant [Hereafter ‘Deceased’] was found dead in her apartment. She was found lying in a pool of blood and in a supine position. The Appellant – Smt. Munilakshmi, the Deceased’s mother, lodged the subject FIR, which was initially registered only under Sections 306 and 498A of IPC. The FIR stated that Respondent No. 1 was coercing the Deceased to consent to divorce as he wanted to marry someone else. It further alleged that Respondent No.1, his family members, and his associates had also previously attempted to kill the Appellant’s daughter. 12. Being aggrieved by the non-inclusion of off ence under Section 302 of IPC in the subject FIR, the Appellant thereafter made another complaint on 25.12.2019, alleging that suspects wearing helmets, etc., used to regularly visit the matrimonial home of the Deceased on the pretext of meeting the resident of the second fl oor but in actuality they would threaten the Deceased, who was staying on the fi rst fl oor of that very house, with dire consequences. Respondent No. 1 along with one Prashanth (accused No. 2), and one Jaganatha (accused No. 3) was accused of killing the Appellant’s daughter. The investigation in Crime No. 151/2019 was eventually completed, and a fi nal report was submitted MUNILAKSHMI v. NARENDRA BABU & ANR. 1065 [SURYA KANT, J.] on 01.03.2020 against four persons, including Respondent No. 1, for the off ences punishable under Sections 109, 120B, 201, 302, 450, 454 read with Section 34 of the IPC. In the fi nal report, Respondent No. 1 was accused of hatching a criminal conspiracy to kill his wife by giving a ‘supari’ to accused Nos. 2 and 3, who assaulted the Deceased fatally. All the accused were arrested. 13. Soon after his arrest, Respondent No. 1 applied for bail. The High Court in the impugned dated 12.08.2020 observed that though several other cases were pending against Respondent No. 1; however, the allegations against him in Crime No.151/2019 are punishable under Sections 109 and 120B, IPC only. The High Court observed that whether the material like cell phone, and CCTV footage, was suffi cient to prove the allegation of hatching of a criminal conspiracy is a subject matter of trial, and there was no other material as of then to show that Respondent No.
