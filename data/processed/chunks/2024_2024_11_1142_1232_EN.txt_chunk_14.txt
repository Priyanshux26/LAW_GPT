As such; this Hon’ble Court cannot exercise its powers of appointment of Arbitrator to the present alleged dispute between the Parties. 12. Given that the Governing law and jurisdiction is of Courts in UAE and Arbitration is stipulated to be under UAE Arbitration and Conciliation rules ; this Hon’ble Court has no jurisdiction to either entertain the present Petition and apply any provisions of the Arbitration Act or any other Indian law. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1165 M/s Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/s Micromax Informatics Fze II. NO PRIVITY OF CONTRACT BETWEEN PETITIONER AND MICROMAX INFORMATICS LTD. (INDIA): 13. Admittedly the Distributor Agreement dated 09.11.2010 containing the Arbitration Clause provides for dispute resolution between the Petitioner and Respondent, M/s. Micromax Informatics FZE (UAE), an entity of UAE. Admittedly, Micromax Informatics Ltd. (India) is neither a party nor a signatory to the Distributor Agreement. Micromax Informatics Ltd. (India) is not even a Respondent to the present proceedings but has been sought to be impleaded by an Interim Application No.110064/2023. Thus, there exists no privity of contract between the Petitioner and the Indian Entity, Micromax Informatics Ltd. (India). 14. Further, the Petitioner has sought to rely on communications between the Parties to establish privity of contract and assert Micromax Informatics Ltd. (India) as party to dispute. But in an email dated 23.12.2012 (Ann. P-2 @Pg.52 (PDF Pg. 81) of Petition); Micromax Informatics Ltd. (India) while making reference to M/s. Micromax Informatics FZE (UAE) and Micromax Informatics Ltd. (India) has explicitly and categorically stated that the accounts of both companies are separate and there are sums receivable in Micromax Informatics Ltd. (India). 15. Even assuming though not admitting that the transactions with Micromax India were under the Distributor Agreement then too, the terms of the Distributor Agreement with respect to territory, rules of arbitration, governing law, jurisdiction and other terms of agreement would remain same and cannot be considered to be varied. The Distributor Agreement in Clause 23.2 (Ann. P-1 at Pg. 48) (PDF Pg 77) stipulates that no addition to or modification of any provision of this agreement shall be binding unless made by a written instrument signed by duly authorized representative of each of the parties. 1166 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports In view of the above, it is most respectfully prayed that the present Petition may kindly be dismissed.” C. ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION 20. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the following questions of law fall for our consideration: - I. Whether, the present petition under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 is maintainable? II. Whether, Part I of the Act, 1996 is applicable to the arbitration clause contained in the Distributorship Agreement dated 09.11.2010? III. What is the seat of the arbitration in terms of the Distributorship Agreement dated 09.11.2010? D. ANALYSIS 21. It is necessary to delve into the history of the law of arbitration in India. Prior to the 1996 Act, three Acts governed the law of Arbitration in India — the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937, which gave effect to the Geneva Convention, the Arbitration Act, 1940 (for short, the “Act, 1940”), which dealt with domestic awards, and the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961 (for short, the “Act, 1961”) which gave effect to the New York Convention of 1958 and which dealt with challenges to awards made which were foreign awards.
