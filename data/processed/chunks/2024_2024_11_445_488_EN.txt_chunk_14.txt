By its of 12.11.2012, the State Commission rejected both the prayers. The State Commission held that the mega power status was made available to a project only when the State in which the project is being setup had undertaken the reforms mentioned in the Ministry of Power’s letter dated 03.12.2009; that these reforms were undertaken by the Government of Punjab only on 16.04.2010 and intimated to the Central Government vide letter dated 30.04.2012; that the detailing in respect of the modified policy was not available in the press release dated 01.10.2009; that the same was covered 468 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports only in the letter dated 03.12.2009 of the Ministry of Power addressed to the States and in the notification of the Ministry of Power dated 14.12.2009. The Commission further held that the benefit of mega power status cannot be granted with effect from 01.10.2009 considering the fact that it was only after a gazette notification that the public at large were informed of the decisions of the Government and which gazette notification was issued only in December, 2009. That the press release itself provided a disclaimer that though all efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and the currency and the content of the website of the Press Information Bureau, the same should not be construed as a statement of law or used for any legal purpose. On the FTP issue, it was held that the benefits under the FTP were never available to the appellant and if identical benefits were indeed available to them under the FTP, there was no need for them to claim the same benefit under the modified Mega Power Policy. It was further held that even if it was assumed for the sake of argument that the FTP benefits were available before the cutoff date, they have forfeited their right to these benefits by claiming similar benefits under the new Mega Power Policy.
