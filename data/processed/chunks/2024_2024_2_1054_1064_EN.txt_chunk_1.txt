[Para 15] Evidence Act, 1872 – s. 106 – Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge – Application of s. 106: Held: Section 106 is an exception to the general rule laid down in s. 101 which casts burden of proving a fact on the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue – s. 106 is not intended to relieve any person of that duty or burden – It says that when a fact to be proved, either affirmatively or negatively, is especially within the knowledge of a person, it is for him to prove it – s. 106 in its application to criminal cases, applies where the defence of the accused depends on his proving a fact especially within his knowledge and of nobody else – s.106 cannot be used to shift the burden of proving the offence from the prosecution to the accused – It can only when the prosecution led evidence, which, if believed, will sustain a conviction or which makes out a prima facie case, that the question of shifting the onus to prove such facts on the accused would arise.
