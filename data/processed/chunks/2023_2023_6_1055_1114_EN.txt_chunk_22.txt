Referring to this document, the original of which we have seen, it has been submitted that the entries therein were not in right sequence. To give illustration, Mr. Patil has submitted that the entry number 550 relates to the incumbent entering class 4 on 16th August C 1984 whereas entry number 551 shows the incumbent’s entry into class 1 on 4th September 1985. Four other entries, 552, 553, 554 and 565 showed sequence of dates of entry of the incumbents thereof in asymmetric . In fact, his submission has been that this entry register was manufactured and the pages were manipulated. His further submission on this count is that the date of birth of Niranaram recorded D as 1st February 1982 ought not to be accepted, having regard to the provisions of Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (“1872 Act”). On this count, he has relied on decisions of this Court in the cases of Ravinder Singh Gorkhi -vs- State of U.P. [(2006) 5 SCC 584] and Ramdeo Chauhan alias Raj Nath -vs- State of Assam [(2001) 5 E SCC 714]. On probative value of the entry in the admission register, he has relied on the of this Court in the case of Birad Mal Singhvi -vs- Anand Purohit [(1988) Supp SCC 604]. On this point, his submission is that the entry regarding age of a person does not carry much evidentiary value to prove the age in absence of materials on which his age was recorded in the school register. He has also taken us through the “pariwar F card” dated 1st January 1989, in which the years of birth of Andaram, Niranaram, and Mukhram ought to be 1976, 1977 and 1979, on the basis of age of the said individuals reflected therein. As per the school records, these years ought to have been 1980, 1982 and 1983. Voter’s list dated 1st January 1993 carried the age of Niranaram as 18 years. The cases in G which the plea of juvenility was accepted by this Court, Mr. Patil’s argument is that age determination was made in bline cases, between 16 and 18 years. He has also highlighted the fact that the time at which the petitioner was produced before the Magistrate after arrest, the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 (“1986 Act”) was operational. H 1086 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 15. We shall first examine the issue of the actual identity of Niranaram. Is he the same person who has been convicted and subsequently sentenced to death as Narayan? Even in the review petition, the applicant described himself as Narayan Chetanram Chaudhary. The filing date of the review petition is 31st October 2000. From the materials before us, we find that his identity as Niranaram Chetanram Chaudhary B surfaced in early part of January 2006, as it would appear from Annexure A-7 to the application. This communication has been captioned as “Mercy Petition on behalf a juvenile to the President.” In this Mercy Petition, the applicant has been referred to as Niranaram.
