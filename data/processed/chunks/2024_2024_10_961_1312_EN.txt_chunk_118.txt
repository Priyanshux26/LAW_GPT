This was, thereafter, the consistent view that was laid down in a plethora of decisions.210 333. There were diverging views expressed in the case of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India, wherein this Court held that though the right to vote may not be construed as a fundamental right, it is nonetheless a constitutional right.211 The debate on this issue was finally laid to rest by this Court in Rajbala v. State of Haryana212 in the course of adjudicating the constitutionality of the Haryana Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Act, 1935. The Court therein held that the right to vote under Article 326 was not merely a statutory 208 N.P. Ponnuswami v. Returning Officer, Namakkal Constituency, AIR 1952 SC 64 209 Jyoti Basu v. Debi Gosal, AIR 1982 SC 983 210 Shyamdeo Prasad Singh v. Nawal Kishore Yadav (2000) 8 SCC 46, para 25; Krishnamoorthy v. Sivakumar (2015) 3 SCC 467 211 People’s Union for Civil Liberties v.

Digital Supreme Court Reports right but was a constitutional right that conferred upon citizens the right to vote, subject to certain limitations. It may thus be seen that with the aid of judicial construction in the context of the nature of the right to vote, it has been upgraded from being a mere statutory right to a constitutional right. More recently, this view was once again affirmed by this Court in Anoop Baranwal v. Union of India.213 334. It is also crucial to take into consideration that Articles 325 and 326 contained in Part XV of the Constitution, deal with rights and duties in the context of elections. These provisions broadly encompass the powers and duties conferred upon various bodies, with the objective of ensuring that elections are conducted in a free and fair manner. For instance, Article 324 vests the Election Commission with powers to supervise elections, thereby ensuring free and fair elections. Similarly, Article 329 limits the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction in election matters. Any challenge to an election can be made after the election has been completed through an election petition under the Representation of People Act, 1951.214 These provisions have been included with the intent of strengthening the political rights of the citizens of the country. It is trite law that provisions which pertain to the same subject matter must be read as a whole and in their entirety, each throwing light and illuminating the meaning of the other. 335. The objective of these provisions, and more specifically Article 326, is, therefore, to enfranchise people as opposed to disenfranchising them. As illuminated by the historical trajectory of adult suffrage in India and the meticulous deliberations of the framers in instating Article 326, the evident purpose of its inclusion was to bestow upon every individual citizen the right to exercise their vote and choose their elected representatives. Hence, in contemplating the contentions put forth by the Petitioners, the question which arises is whether the right under Article 326 can be invoked to exclude certain individuals.
