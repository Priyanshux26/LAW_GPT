ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY THE APPELLANT F 18. The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that: I. As per Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India, a representation made by the detenue in cases of preventive detention must be considered at the earliest, and an inordinate delay in considering the representation is grounds G enough for the detention to be set aside. II. While relying on a catena of s rendered by this Court, it was argued that the Central Government is not under any compulsion to wait for the recommendation of the Advisory Board and must act independently and without H delay in deciding the representation of the detenue. PRAMOD SINGLA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 801 [KRISHNA MURARI, J.] III. Further, the Ld. Counsel for the appellant contends that the A decisions of this Court in the case of K.M. Abdulla Kunhi & B.L. Abdul Khader v. Union Of India & Ors. 1 and Ankit Ashok Jalan vs Union Of India & Ors.2 , both of which are Constitution Bench s, which state that the central Government must wait for the decision of B the Advisory Board, are in direct contravention with Constitution Bench s of this Court in Pankaj Kumar Chakraborty And Ors. v. State of West Bengal3 and the Jayanarayan Sukul v State Of West Bengal4, and due to the apparent conflict, the issue needs to be referred to a Larger Bench. C IV. It was also contended that the documents supplied to the appellant herein as grounds for his preventive detention were illegible and in Chinese language, and hence on this ground also the impugned detention as against the appellant must be quashed.
