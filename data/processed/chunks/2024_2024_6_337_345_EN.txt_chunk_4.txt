Sub-section (3), which is relevant for our purpose, provides the assessee with the option of getting the refund or carrying it forward to the next tax period as a tax credit. In case of refund, Section 38(3)(a) provides the timeline for refund from the date on which the return is furnished or claim for refund is made as: (i) within one month, if the period for refund is one month; (ii) within two months, if the period for refund is a quarter. Sub-section (4) provides that if notice has been issued under Section 58 or additional information has been sought under Section 59, then the amount shall be carried forward to the next tax period as tax credit. Sub-sections (5) and (6) pertain to security. Sub-section (7) provides certain exclusions while calculating the period under sub-section (3). Sub-sections (8)-(10) pertain to refund in cases of sale to registered and unregistered dealers. Lastly, sub- section (11) provides that the refund shall not be allowed to a dealer who has not filed any return that is due under the Act. 344 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 8. The language of Section 38(3) is mandatory and the department must adhere to the timeline stipulated therein to fulfil the object of the provision, which is to ensure that refunds are processed and issued in a timely manner. 9. In the present case, Section 38(3)(a)(ii) is relevant as both the refunds in the present case pertain to quarter tax periods. Therefore, as per Section 38(3)(a)(ii), the refund should have been processed within two months from when the returns were filed (31.03.2017 and 29.03.2019), which comes up to 31.05.2017 and 29.05.2019. The default notices are dated 30.03.2020, 23.03.2021, 30.03.2021, and 26.03.2022. It is therefore evident that the default notices were issued after the period within which the refund should have been processed. Sub-section (2) only permits adjusting amounts towards recovery that are “due under the Act”. By the time when the refund should have been processed as per the provisions of the Act, the dues under the default notices had not crystallised and the respondent was not liable to pay the same at the time. The appellant-department is therefore not justified in retaining the refund amount beyond the stipulated period and then adjusting the refund amount against the amounts due under default notices that were issued subsequent to the refund period. 10. Further, the learned ASG’s contention that the purpose of the timeline provided under sub-section (3) is only for calculation of interest under Section 428 would defeat the object of the provision. Such an interpretation would effectively enable the department to retain refundable amounts for long durations for the purpose of adjusting 8 The relevant portion of Section 42 reads: “42. Interest (1) A person entitled to a refund under this Act, shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the refund, simple interest at the annual rate notified by the Government from time to time, computed on a daily basis from the later of – (a) the date that the refund was due to be paid to the person; or (b) the date that the overpaid amount was paid by the person, until the date on which the refund is given.
