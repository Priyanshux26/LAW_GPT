Also at the time of passing of impugned those posts had already been fi lled. Thus due to non-availability of posts, the relief was denied. 21. As per the directions issued by this Court vide dated 14.8.2023, the Registrar General of the High Court of Judicature at Patna fi led an affi davit after perusing the documents produced before him by the State of Bihar and the BPSC. In the said affi davit, it is admitted that the case of the appellants Sweety Kumari and Vikramaditya Mishra is similar to the case of Aarav Jain (supra). As per the information furnished by the High Court, appellant Sweety Kumari in SC category secured 414 marks when the cut-off was 405 marks and the appellant Vikramaditya who applied under unreserved category secured 543 marks whereas the cut off under the unreserved category was 517. It is also fairly stated that in the 30th Examination, the total vacancies were 349 but after issuing of the directions by this Court, the State appointed 351 candidates deducting one post each of EWS and SC category from the future vacancies which were to be advertised under the 32nd Examination. 22. Learned counsel for the appellant Sweety Kumari has fairly stated before this Court that she got selected in the 31st Examination under the SC category and joined the service. In view of the discussion made hereinabove and the affi davit fi led by the Registrar General, it is clear that the case of appellant Sweety Kumari and appellant Vikramaditya Mishra are at par with the case of Aarav Jain and other seven candidates who were appointed in furtherance of the of this Court dated 23.05.2022 in Aarav Jain (supra). 23. Appellants in Aarav Jain (supra) have been appointed by the State Government extending the number of vacancies advertised in the 30th Examination by borrowing those extra vacancies from the 32nd Examination. The vacancies notifi ed for the 32nd Examination are in process of being SWEETY KUMARI v. THE STATE OF BIHAR 565 [J. K. MAHESHWARI, J.] fi lled. The case of appellants Sweety Kumari and Vikramaditya Mishra were dismissed by the High Court relying upon its earlier dated 04.05.2021 in Aarav Jain v. The Bihar Public Service Commission (CWJC No. 24282/2019). The said dated 04.05.2021 was challenged by Aarav Jain and seven other candidates by fi ling special leave petitions. The said special leave petitions were converted into civil appeals and this Court vide dated 23.05.2022 set-aside the dated 04.05.2021 of the High Court. 24. Therefore, there cannot be any reason to deny similar benefi ts to the present two appellants at par with Aarav Jain and seven other candidates as ed by this Court in Aarav Jain (supra). We are of the considered view that present aforesaid two appellants (Sweety Kumari, Vikramaditya Mishra) cannot be discriminated by not granting relief merely because of non-availability of vacancies in the 30th Examination. 25. Reverting to the case of appellant Aditi, which is related to the 31st Examination, as per the affi davit submitted by the Registrar General, it is apparent that out of 221 vacancies advertised, only 214 candidates were recommended for appointment and seven vacancies have been carried forward to the 32nd Examination.
