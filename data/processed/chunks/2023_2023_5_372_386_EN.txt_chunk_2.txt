[Para 14, 15][385-G-H; 386-A-B] 1.5 As far as the right to vote is concerned, the 1950 Act is G applicable to the Scheduled Area and therefore, the appellant cannot contend that only a person belonging to Scheduled Tribe can cast a vote in elections of the constituencies in the Scheduled Area. The right to vote will be governed by Part III of the 1950 Act. Every eligible voter is entitled to be registered in the H ADIVASIS FOR SOCIAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTION v. 375 UNION OF INDIA & ORS. electoral roll of a constituency, in which he is ordinarily residing. A Therefore, any person eligible to vote who is ordinarily residing in the Scheduled Area has a right to vote, even if he is a non- Tribal. [Para 16][386-B-D] 1.6 As regards providing reservation for all the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative constituencies in a Scheduled Area, the B appellant cannot contend that all the constituencies in a Scheduled area should be reserved for the Scheduled Tribes. Reservation is required to be made in terms of Articles 330 and 332 of the Constitution of India. These provisions do not provide that all the constituencies in the Scheduled Areas shall be reserved for C Scheduled Tribes. Moreover, the 2002 Act is applicable to the Scheduled Area. Therefore, even the said prayer to issue a writ of mandamus, as regards the reservation for the Scheduled Tribes, is rejected. [Para 17][386-D-E] 1.7 The Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was made applicable to D the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. In the absence of the exercise of power by the Hon’ble Governor under sub-clause (1) of Clause 5 of the Fifth Schedule, the said law was applicable to the Scheduled Area. [Para 18][386-E-F] 1.8 There is absolutely no merit in the appeal, and the High E Court was right when it dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant.
