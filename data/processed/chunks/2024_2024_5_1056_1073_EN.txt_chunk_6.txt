The Act, 2019 came into effect from 31.10.2019, which was the appointed day as per Notification No. S.O. 2889(E) dated 09.08.2019. Section 95 of the Act, 2019 speaks of the application of the Central Laws to the Union Territory of the Jammu & Kashmir and Union Territory of Ladakh. The aforesaid notification provides a date of application i.e., 31.10.2019, for the implementation of the Fifth Schedule of the Act, 2019. 20. A perusal of Table 1 and Table 3 of the Fifth Schedule would clearly show that CrPC, 1973 would govern the field only from the appointed day and consequently the CrPC, 1989 stands repealed. To reiterate, it would come into effect only from the appointed day, and therefore has got no retrospective application. To make this position clear, the CrPC, 1973 shall be pressed into service from 31.10.2019 onwards, and thus certainly not before the appointed day. 1068 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
