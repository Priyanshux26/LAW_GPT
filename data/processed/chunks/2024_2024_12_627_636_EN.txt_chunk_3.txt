The Trial Court on 05.08.2022 remanded the Appellant to judicial custody, where he has remained since. The ED thereafter filed ML Case No. 13/2022 (ED Case) under Sections 44 and 45 of the PMLA before the Trial Court against the Appellant, his associate and various dummy companies that are claimed to have been set up by the Appellant. 9. At this juncture, given that the Appellant is involved in various investigations, owing to the racket of illegal appointment of unmerited candidates to the posts of Primary School Teachers, Assistant Teachers for Class IX-X and Class XI-XII, Group C Posts and Group D Posts, it is useful to provide clarity and avoid any confusion regarding the current status of the different cases, through the following table: 632 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Sl. Investigating Case Details Date of Current Status No. Authority Arrest 1. ED ECIR/KLZO11/ 23.07.2022 Appellant 19/2022 (Primary in judicial Teachers custody since Recruitment Scam) 05.08.2022. Complaint filed. 2. ED ECIR/KLZO11/ - Under 17/1022 (Group investigation. C and D Posts Recruitment Scam) 3. ED ECIR/KLZO11/ - Under 18/1022 (Assistant investigation. Teachers Recruitment Scam, Class IX-XII) 4. CBI RC No. 6/2022 – 01.10.2024 Chargesheet and Predicate offense supplementary (Primary teachers chargesheet recruitment scam) filed. Further investigation underway. 5. CBI RC No. 2/2022 - Charge sheeted (Group D posts in the second recruitment scam) prosecution complaint. 6. CBI RC No. 5/2022 16.09.2024 Charge sheeted (Group C posts in the main recruitment scam) prosecution complaint. 7. CBI RC No. 3/2022 - Charge sheeted (Class IX-X in the third teachers prosecution recruitment scam) complaint. 8. CBI RC No. 4/2022 - Charge sheeted (Class XI- in the second XII teachers prosecution recruitment scam) complaint. 10. That being the state of affairs, the Appellant filed a bail application before the Trial Court in connection with the ED Case, which was rejected on 03.08.2023. The Appellant then sought bail before the High Court but the same came to be declined vide the impugned [2024] 12 S.C.R. 633 Partha Chatterjee v. Directorate of Enforcement judgement dated 30.04.2024. The grounds for such rejection were based on the statements made by witnesses under Section 50 of the PMLA as well as other corroborating material, owing to which the High Court held that the Appellant had failed to overcome the twin conditions postulated by Section 45 of the PMLA. 11. The aggrieved Appellant is thus before us seeking bail, inter alia, on the following grounds: (i) the prolonged period of incarceration of over two years; (ii) the Appellant was neither named nor chargesheeted in the predicate offence; (iii) the Appellant does not have any criminal antecedents and has deep roots in society; (iv) he is not a flight risk or likely to tamper with evidence or witnesses; (v) no cash was recovered from the Appellant during search and seizure by the respondent ED; (vi) the Appellant is 72 years of age and suffers from multiple health ailments; (vii) the Appellant has already spent one-third of the total sentence prescribed for the offence and thus, is entitled to bail under Section 479 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS); and (viii) there is no hope in the trial commencing in view of the 442 documents and 183 witnesses cited for examination.
