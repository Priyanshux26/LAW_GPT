It was alleged that the appellant used to come to the complainant’s house every day and had sexual intercourse with the complainant forcibly and without her consent by giving false promise of marriage. (v) It was also alleged that whenever the complainant asked him to marry her, he avoided the same on one pretext or other. Thereafter, the appellant avoided visiting her since March 2017 and he used to abuse and beat her when she asked for money for her daily needs. According to the complainant, he ended the relationship with her by informing her to do whatever she wanted and to forget the promise of marriage. Thereafter, she made several calls to the appellant as to why he was not coming, but the appellant did not receive her calls. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 891 Mahesh Damu Khare v. The State of Maharashtra & Anr.
