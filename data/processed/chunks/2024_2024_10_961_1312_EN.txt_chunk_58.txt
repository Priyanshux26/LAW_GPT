Judicial discretion, while applying this doctrine, must always be governed by the objective of promoting the larger public interest; and if a claim affects the public at large, the Court should go into the merits of the case.70 Where it is found that denial of consideration on merits is likely to affect society in general and can have a cascading effect on millions of citizens, the Court will carve out an exception and proceed to decide the lis on merits. 64 State of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal (1986) 4 SCC 566, para 24. 65 1964 SCC OnLine SC 1, para 8. 66 Daryao v. State of U.P., 1961 SCC OnLine SC 21, para 23. 67 Amrit Lal Berry v. CCE (1975) 4 SCC 714, paras 16 and 23. 68 Tukaram Kana Joshi v. MIDC (2013) 1 SCC 353, paras 12 - 15; Vidya Devi v. State of Himachal Pradesh (2020) 2 SCC 569, para 12.12. 69 Kashinath G. Jalmi (Dr) v. The Speaker (1993) 2 SCC 703, paras 28 and 30. 70 Id, paras 34 and 35. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1047 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 66. Another vital circumstance where the doctrine of delay and laches would not be applicable strictly is in matters where the vires of a statute are challenged vis-à-vis the Constitution. This Court has, in the due course of time, accepted the idea of transformative constitutionalism, which conceptualizes the Constitution not as a still document cast in stone at the day of its formation but as a living and dynamic body of law, capable of constant updation and evolution as per changing societal mores. Should this Court deny a constitutional challenge solely based on delay, it would effectively establish an arbitrary cut-off beyond which laws could no longer be re-examined in light of changing circumstances. Such a rigid approach cannot be countenanced as changing societal circumstances sometimes necessitate a reconsideration of the status quo—even when the challenge is brought after a considerable lapse of time. 67. To instantiate, a Constitution Bench of this Court in Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India,71 held Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 to be ultra vires of the Constitution, regardless of the fact that the provision was a part of the statute for over a century. The Court took note of the norms of contemporary society and declared them to be unconstitutional. If the doctrine of laches were to be applied strictly, time would run in favour of a constitutionally invalid statute, which cannot be allowed in the larger interests of justice and the transformative nature of the Constitution. (b) Applicability of doctrine of laches to the present case 68. Adverting to the facts of the case, it seems that the two mitigating circumstances mentioned above are directly attracted. 69. First, the Petitioners have raised various substantial questions that affect the public at large, including the erosion of the culture of indigenous communities, discrimination against the State of Assam, and the larger perceived threat to the security of the country from immigration.
