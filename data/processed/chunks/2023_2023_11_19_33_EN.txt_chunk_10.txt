a failure of justice had in fact been occasioned to the respondent-accused as contemplated in the said sub-section (3). As a matter of fact, neither the respondent had pleaded nor the High Court opined whether any failure of justice had occasioned to the respondent, on account of error if any, occurred in granting the sanction by the authority. 15. As a matter of fact, such an interlocutory application seeking discharge in the midst of trial would also not be maintainable. Once the cognizance was taken by the Special Judge and the charge was framed against the accused, the trial could neither have been stayed nor scuttled in the midst of it in view of Section 19(3) of the said Act. In the instant case, though the issue of validity of sanction was raised at the earlier point of time, the same was not pressed for. The only stage open to the respondent- accused in that situation was to raise the said issue at the fi nal arguments in the trial in accordance with law. 16. In that view of the matter, the impugned passed by the High Court is set aside. It will be open for the respondent to raise the issue of validity of sanction if he desires to do so, in accordance with law at the fi nal stage of arguments in the trial. Special Judge is directed to proceed with the trial from the stage it had stopped, in accordance with the law and as expeditiously as possible. 17. Appeal stands allowed accordingly.
