Digital Supreme Court Reports in Nashirwar v. State of MP16 and Har Shanker v. Dy. Excise and Taxation Commissioner.17 The Allahabad High Court upheld the validity of the U.P Excise (Amendment) (Re-enactment and Validation) Act 1976.18 7. The appellants in Synthetics & Chemicals v. State of UP19 (“Synthetics [2J]”), held licenses for wholesale vend of ‘denatured spirit’. They instituted proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Allahabad High Court for seeking a direction to quash the notification by which vend fee was levied from a wholesale licence dealer of ‘denatured spirit’. The High Court dismissed the petitions. It held that the phrase ‘intoxicating liquors’ in Entry 8 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution includes denatured spirit and that the State was, therefore, competent to levy the vend fee on denatured spirit. 8. Proceedings under Article 136 were instituted for challenging the decision of the High Court. Proceedings were also initiated under Article 32 challenging the constitutional validity of the levy of vend fee. A two-Judge Bench of this Court in Synthetics (2J) (supra) heard the writ petition and the appeals against the s of the Allahabad High Court together. Three issues arose before the Bench. On the issue of the meaning of the phrase ‘intoxicating liquor’ in Entry 8, the two-Judge Bench referred to the decisions of this Court in State of Bombay v. FN Balsara,20 Nashirwar (supra) and Har Shanker (supra) and held that the decisions indicate that the phrase ‘intoxicating liquor’ in Entry 8 of List II comprises of liquor which contains alcohol, both potable and non-potable.21 The second issue was whether in view of IDRA, the power of the State to regulate alcohol (both potable and non-potable) was denuded. In particular, reference was made to the notification issued by the Union under Section 18-G of the IDRA prescribing the price of various types of alcohol and rectified spirit. The two-Judge Bench referred to the decision of a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Tika 16 [1975] 2 SCR 861 : 1975 AIR 360 17 AIR 1957 SC 414 18 1976 ALJ 436 (FB) 19 [1980] 2 SCR 531 : (1980) 2 SCC 441 20 [1951] 1 SCR 682 : (1951) SCC 860 21 (1980) 2 SCC 441 [18] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1961 State of U.P. & Ors. v. M/s Lalta Prasad Vaish and sons Ramji v. State of UP22 and entry 33 of List III to hold that the State Legislature had the power to legislate regarding the production, supply and distribution of the products of the industries notified by Parliament under Entry 52 of List I.23 The two-Judge Bench further held that the Ethyl Alcohol (Price Control) issued by the Central Government in exercise of the power under Section 18G of IDRA did not take away the exclusive rights of the State Government relating to intoxicating liquor.24 The third issue was whether the phrase ‘foreign liquor’ in Section 24-A includes denatured spirit or only alcohol for human consumption. The Bench held that the meaning of the phrase cannot be restricted to alcohol for human consumption since “when liquor is put to any use such as manufacture of other articles, the liquor is all the same consumed.”25 9. Review petitions were filed against the decision of this Court in Synthetics (2J) (supra).
