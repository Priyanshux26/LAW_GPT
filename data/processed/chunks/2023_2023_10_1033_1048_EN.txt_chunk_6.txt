away from the village of the appellants and deceased. It is further to be noted that his evidence is full of omissions and contradictions. Apart from that, he has admitted in this evidence that the IO Amritpal C Singh (PW-11) was known to him for the last 4-5 years. In his evidence, PW-2 has clearly admitted that though he had a telephone in his house which was in a working condition, he neither informed the family members of the deceased nor the police about the said extra-judicial confession. PW-2 further admitted that he did not convey any information of the said extra-judicial confession to the SHO, though he was known to him. D PW-2 further admitted that one Mr. Gurcharan Singh was the Sarpanch of his village in those days. However, he did not ask the appellants to go and meet him. 12. The law with regard to extra-judicial confession has been succinctly discussed in the case of Munna Kumar Upadhyay alias E Munna Upadhyaya v. State of Andhra Pradesh through Public Prosecutor, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh2, wherein this Court has also referred to its earlier s, which read thus: “56. This Court has had the occasion to discuss the effect of extra-judicial confessions in a number of decisions. In Balwinder F Singh v. State of Punjab [1995 Supp (4) SCC 259 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 59] this Court stated the principle that: (SCC p. 265, para 10) “10. An extra-judicial confession by its very nature is rather a weak type of evidence and requires appreciation with a great G deal of care and caution. Where an extra-judicial confession is surrounded by suspicious circumstances, its credibility becomes doubtful and it loses its importance.” 2 (2012) 6 SCC 174 H 1042 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 57. In Pakkirisamy v. State of T.N. [(1997) 8 SCC 158 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 1249] the Court held that: (SCC p. 162, para 8) “8. … It is well settled that it is a rule of caution where the court would generally look for an independent reliable corroboration before placing any reliance upon such extra- B judicial confession.” 58. Again, in Kavita v. State of T.N. [(1998) 6 SCC 108 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 1421] the Court stated the dictum that: (SCC p. 109, para 4) “4. There is no doubt that convictions can be based on extra- C judicial confession but it is well settled that in the very nature of things, it is a weak piece of evidence. It is to be proved just like any other fact and the value thereof depends upon the veracity of the witness to whom it is made.” 59. While explaining the dimensions of the principles governing D the admissibility and evidentiary value of an extra-judicial confession, this Court in State of Rajasthan v. Raja Ram [(2003) 8 SCC 180 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 1965] stated the principle that: (SCC p. 192, para 19) “19. An extra-judicial confession, if voluntary and true and E made in a fit state of mind, can be relied upon by the court.
