In her statement under Section 161, she sought to clarify the position by recording that her family had a long-standing enmity with appellants’ family. She also stated that the names of the appellants were mentioned and written by her “falsely without collecting full information.” She categorically stated that the appellants are not involved in the murder of her son. 22. When we contrast this statement with her deposition given five years later, we do not see a drastic change in the stand of PW-1. Even in her chief examination, she had stated that she had an old enmity with the family of the accused. However, in her cross examination, she clarified that as the enmity with the appellants family was going on for the last eleven years, names of the appellants [2024] 6 S.C.R. 19 Shankar v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. were mentioned in the FIR on the basis of suspicion. Therefore, the change of circumstance which the prosecution seeks to contend on the basis of PW-1’s deposition does not satisfy the requirement of Section 319 at all. 23. Having considered the matter in detail, we are of the opinion that PW-1, not being an eye-witness, her deposition is not sufficient enough to invoke the extra-ordinary jurisdiction under Section 319 to summon the appellants. 24. There are no other witnesses who have deposed against the appellants. There is no documentary evidence that the prosecution had collected against the appellants. There is absolutely no role that is attributed to the appellants. We are of the opinion that the deposition of PW-1 is also in line and consistent with her statement under Section 161. When these factors are looked in a holistic manner, it would be clear that the higher degree of satisfaction that is required for exercising power under Section 319 Cr.P.C. is not met in the present case. 25. For the reasons stated above we are of the opinion that the Trial Court committed a serious error in allowing the application under Section 319 and issuing summons to the appellants. The High Court should have exercised its jurisdiction under Section 482 and quashed the . The High Court having failed to quash the of summons dated 24.08.2017, we are inclined to allow these appeals and set- aside the passed by the Trial Court dated 24.08.2017 and the also the of the High Court dated 04.04.2023 dismissing the petition under Section 482. 26. For the reasons stated above, the present appeals are allowed, and the impugned dated 04.04.2023 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Application under Section 482 No. 30221 of 2017 and the dated 24.08.2017 passed by the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Court No. 5, Kanpur Dehat, in S.T. No. 434 of 2011 in Application Paper No. 83Kha under Section 319 Cr.P.C. are hereby set aside. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeals allowed.
