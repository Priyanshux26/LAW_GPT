The plea that once issues are framed, the matter must necessarily go to trial was repelled by this Court in Azhar Hussain v. Rajiv Gandhi, 1986 Supp SCC 315.Followed in ELDECO HOUSING AND INDUSTRIES LIMITED v. ASHOK 885 VIDYARTHI AND OTHERS [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] Manvendrasinhji Ranjitsinhji Jadeja v. Vijaykunverba, 1998 SCC OnLine Guj 281 : (1998) 2 GLH 823. 23.15. The provision of 7 Rule 11 is mandatory in nature. It states that the plaint “shall” be rejected if any of the grounds specifi ed in clauses (a) to (e) are made out. If the court fi nds that the plaint does not disclose a cause of action, or that the suit is barred by any law, the court has no option, but to reject the plaint.” 20. The same view was reiterated in Kum. Geetha v. Nanjundaswamy and others19. 21. The facts in Inbasegaran’s case (supra) are similar to the case in hand. In the above case, initially a suit for injunction was fi led by the vendee restraining the vendor from interfering with the possession and enjoyment of the property. It was pleaded that in pursuance of the agreement, the vendee was delivered possession of the property. Subsequently, suit was fi led seeking decree for specifi c performance of agreement to sell. This Court found that cause of action in both the suits were diff erent, hence the subsequent suit was not held to be barred in terms of II Rule 2 C.P.C. 22. The of this Court in Vurimi Pullarao’s case (supra), relied upon by learned counsel for the respondent is distinguishable as in that case the cause of action to pray for relief of specifi c performance had arisen at the stage when the suit for injunction was fi led, however, the relief was not claimed. To notice certain dates, agreement to sell was executed on 26.10.1995; the time for completion of sale deed was upto 25.10.1996; notice for specifi c performance was issued on 13.10.1996 which was replied to by the vendor therein on 13.10.1996 denying execution of sale deed; the suit for injunction was fi led on 30.10.1998 pleading that the plaintiff is going to fi le a suit for specifi c performance of agreement to sell. Hence at the time of fi ling of the suit for injunction on 30.10.1996, the cause of action for seeking specifi c performance of agreement to sell had arisen. The relief, which was due to the plaintiff therein, when the suit for injunction was fi led was omitted without leave of the Court, hence, barred under II Rule 2(3) C.P.C. was attracted. 19 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1407: 2023 INSC 964. 886 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 23. If the facts of the case are examined in the light of settled position of law, in our opinion, the passed by the High Court in review application cannot be legally sustained. The suit for specifi c performance was fi led by the appellant on the basis of MoU dated 31.08.1998.
