11. The above conclusion of the learned Single Judge was reached without appropriately considering the divorce proceeding between the appellant and his wife - Ganga. The Court also overlooked the family details recorded by the employer (Annexure R/4) which indicates Smt. Ganga as the wife of the employee. The Ration Card also has the same family details of the appellant. 12. The relevant materials reflecting the marriage of the appellant with Smt. Ganga was however ignored by the Writ Court. The Court also failed to appreciate that the learned Labour Court reached the factual conclusion, after due consideration of the material evidence. Such factual finding of the Labour Court should not normally be disturbed by a Writ Court without compelling reason. Such reasons are absent. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1633 Ganapati Bhikarao Naik v. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited Therefore we feel that the Award in favour of the appellant, granted by the Labour Court, was erroneously disturbed by the learned Single Judge. 13. The above discussion persuades us to hold that the appellant is entitled to relief, in terms of the Labour Court’s Award dated 09.08.2012 with consequential service benefits. But allowing backwages may not be justified. It is therefore made clear that the reinstated employee, shall not be entitled to any back wages from 16.12.2020, when the learned Single Judge set aside the Award, till he is reinstated. However, the gap period i.e. 16.12.2020 till reinstatement, should be taken into account for all other service benefits. The appellant is ed to be reinstated in service, within four weeks from today. 14. With the above, the appeals stand allowed leaving the parties to bear their own cost. Result of the case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Gaurav Upadhyay, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Shadan Farasat, Sr. Adv.)
