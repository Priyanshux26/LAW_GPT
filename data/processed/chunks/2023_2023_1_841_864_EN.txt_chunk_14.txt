[Matru v. State of U.P., (1971) 2 SCC 75, para 17 : F 1971 SCC (Cri) 391] ; Mulla v. State of U.P. [Mulla v. State of U.P., (2010) 3 SCC 508, paras 41 & 43 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1150] and C. Muniappan v. State of T.N. [C. Muniappan v. State of T.N., (2010) 9 SCC 567, para 42 : (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 1402] ). The evidence of a TIP is admissible under Section 9 of the Evidence Act. However, it is not a substantive piece of evidence. G Instead, it is used to corroborate the evidence given by witnesses before a court of law at the time of trial. Therefore, TIPs, even if held, cannot be considered in all the cases as trustworthy evidence on which the conviction of an accused can be sustained (State of H.P. v. Lekh Raj [State of H.P. v. Lekh Raj, (2000) 1 SCC 247, H 860 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A para 3 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 147] and C. Muniappan v. State of T.N. [C. Muniappan v. State of T.N., (2010) 9 SCC 567, para 42 : (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 1402] ). 30. It is a matter of great importance both for the investigating agency and for the accused and a fortiori for the proper B administration of justice that a TIP is held without avoidable and unreasonable delay after the arrest of the accused. This becomes necessary to eliminate the possibility of the accused being shown to the witnesses before the test identification parade. This is a very common plea of the accused, and therefore, the prosecution has to be cautious to ensure that there is no scope for making C such an allegation. If, however, circumstances are beyond control and there is some delay, it cannot be said to be fatal to the prosecution. But reasons should be given as to why there was a delay (Mulla v. State of U.P. [Mulla v. State of U.P., (2010) 3 SCC 508, para 45 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1150] and Suresh Chandra D Bahri v. State of Bihar [Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of Bihar, 1995 Supp (1) SCC 80 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 60]).” Section 149 of Indian Penal Code, 1860: 35. The witnesses clearly speak about the presence of a large group of persons belonging to the side of the accused. In fact, the evidence E is to the effect that they also participated in the occurrence. In a case involving the applicability of Section 149 IPC, a little more scrutiny is required on the part of the Court as there may be a tendency to implicate persons along with the actual accused who committed the offence. The Courts will have to be very circumspect while sifting through the evidence in such cases. In the case on hand, we find that it would be unsafe to F implicate the accused persons under Section 149 IPC which obviously deals with an element of vicarious liability, as held by this Court in Arvind Kumar (supra), “Scope of Section 149 G 50.
