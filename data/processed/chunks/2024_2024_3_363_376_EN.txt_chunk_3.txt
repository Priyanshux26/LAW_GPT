2 were sent for re-examination to Government Analysts Lab, Thiruvananthapuram, and the report dated 03.12.2022 said that the cardamom samples submitted by respondent no. 2 contained pesticides above the permissible threshold. 9. It is at this stage that respondent no. 1 filed a writ petition before the High Court seeking the following two reliefs: “Issue a writ of mandamus or appropriate writ, direction or to the respondents to conduct an analysis of the cardamom which was purchased after cancellation of Ext. P9 tender at Government Analytical Lab Thiruvananthapuram under the supervision of this Court. Issue a writ of Certiorari or appropriate writ, direction to the respondents to cancel the local purchase of cardamom as it was done without competition and newspaper advertisement.” 368 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 10. After taking cognizance of the matter, the High Court passed an dated 23.12.2022 directing the sample to be subjected to re-examination at the Government Analyst Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram. The resultant report dated 28.12.2022 was nothing different from the previous report, labelling the cardamom as ‘unsafe’. In fact, even the Commissioner of Food Safety through his report dated 05.01.2023 termed the product as ‘unsafe’. Further, the High Court through its dated 06.01.2023 directed the samples to be sent to the FSSAI Office at Kochi for re-examination. Even FSSAI, Kochi, termed the product as ‘unsafe’ through its report dated 11.01.2023. Therefore, placing reliance on these developments, the High Court of Kerala by its dated 11.01.2023 restrained the appellant-Board from distributing the Aravana Prasadam and directed the sealing of the warehouse where the Aravana Prasadam was stored. 11. Pending disposal of the writ petition, the appellant-Board filed I.A. No. 3 of 2023 on 17.01.2023 before the High Court. Through this application, it sought the following relief: “[…] permit the petitioners to draw sample, from the stock of Aravana kept sealed, through the food safety officers and to send the same for analysis to any laboratory accredited by FSSAI to test whether the Aravana prasadam confirms to the food standards prescribed by FSSAI and is safe for human consumption, in the interest of justice, pending disposal of the writ petition.” In this application, it was asserted that the sale of prasadam was stopped on 11.01.2023. It stated that the available stock of 6,65,159 cans of prasadam, balance stock of 800 grams of cardamom, and 43.92 kilograms of cardamom powder were sealed. While this was to be sampled by the Government Analyst’s Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram, the appellant-Board sought that the same be sampled by another laboratory in parallel. 12. The writ petition itself came to be partly disposed of by the High Court through the impugned interim dated 27.03.2023, where the High Court dismissed the I.A. No. 3 of 2023. The High Court relied on the tests conducted previously to dismiss the said application. It further held that the appellant-Board falls under the definition of “food business operator”, for the purposes of section 3(1)(j) of the Act, with a co-relative obligation to ensure that the food sold / distributed, and [2024] 3 S.C.R.
