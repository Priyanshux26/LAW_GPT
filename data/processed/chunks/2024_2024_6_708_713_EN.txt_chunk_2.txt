Civil Appeal No. 2794/2011) 5 Writ C. No. 63467/2011 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 711 Subodh Singh v. Union of India and Others to the appellant for 0.0624 Hectare of land along with additional compensation within a period of two months. 5. On 19th November, 2016, the respondents prepared a bank draft for a sum of ₹ 2,74,56,000/- (Rupees Two Crores Seventy Four Lakh Fifty Six Thousand) stating that the same was in respect of the compensation payable to the appellant in terms of the passed by the High Court on 20th September, 2016. While calculating the additional compensation, the respondent no.2 confined the same to a period of two months for the delayed period. 6. Aggrieved by the compensation offered by the respondents limiting the delay to only two months, the appellant approached the High Court by filing yet another petition6 claiming that he was entitled to compensation for a period of 84 months, which would come to Rs.10,23,28,000/- (Rupees Ten Crores Twenty Three Lakh and Twenty Eight Thousand), on which the impugned dated 31st August, 2017, has been passed observing that the appellant ought to approach the Arbitrator for determining the additional compensation, by invoking Section 20F (1) of the Act. 7. It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the respondents have adopted a pick and choose policy in the instant case. While they have paid additional compensation for a period of delay of 66 months to one Smt. Kamla Devi & Ors., who were similarly situated persons like the appellant and their land was also acquired under the very same award, in the case of the appellant the respondents have arbitrarily confined the payment towards the delay only to two months, instead of 84 months. 8. We have perused the record and heard the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties. 9. At the outset, we may note that the dated 18th September, 2017, passed by the Competent Authority refers to an dated 19th July, 2017, passed by the High Court in a Writ Petition7 filed by Kamla Devi and others and goes on to record that after completion of formalities of publication, some portion of the land admeasuring 0.0890 Hectare had been left out, as the same was not required for 6 Writ C No. 39875/2017 7 WP No. 65267 of 2012 712 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the subject project. Subsequently, another award8 was declared in respect of the left out area and additional compensation was paid to the land owners @ 5% per month of the award for a period of 66 months, i.e. from 19th April, 2012 to 12th September, 2017. In the light of the above, the appellant herein is justified in arguing that he cannot be treated differently and in his case, the respondents ought not to have confined the delayed payment on the awarded amount for the left out portion of land to only two months. 10. The aforesaid submission is disputed by learned counsel for the respondents on a plea that no such direction was issued either by this Court or the High Court permitting compensation for the delayed period beyond two months, for which reliance is sought to be placed on the dated 20th September, 2016 passed by the High Court.
