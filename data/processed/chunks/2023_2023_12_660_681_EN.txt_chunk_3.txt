10. It was next contended that the process of compassionate appointment of the next of kin of the deceased was initiated, therefore, a claim for compensation was not maintainable under the 1923 Act. More so, when the claimants-respondents had an alternate remedy available under Section 124-A of the 1989 Act. 11. In support of his submissions, the learned counsel for the appellants relied on certain decisions, namely, (i) Union of India v. Sri Harananda1, wherein, relying on Sections 3 and 8 of the 1957 Act, it was held that RPF is an Armed Force of the Union. However, this decision is not in the context of the 1923 Act. (ii) United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Orient Treasures Pvt. Ltd.2, wherein it was observed that when the words of a statute are clear, plain or unambiguous i.e., they are reasonably susceptible to only one meaning, the courts are bound to give effect to that meaning irrespective of consequences; and (iii) Union of India v. Prabhakaran Vijaya Kumar3, wherein it was observed that in a beneficial or welfare statute if the words used therein are capable of two constructions, the one which is more in consonance with the object of the Act, and for the benefit of the person for whom the Act was made, should be preferred. (Note: This decision was relied upon to canvass that compensation could be had under Section 124-A of the 1989 Act and, therefore, there was no justification to invoke the provisions of the 1923 Act) 1 (2019) 14 SCC 126 2 (2016) 3 SCC 49 3 (2008) 9 SCC 527 666 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 12. On behalf of the respondents, it was submitted that Section 2 (1) (n) (i) of the 1923 Act unequivocally states that workman means a “railway servant” as defi ned in Section 2(34) of the 1989 Act. Section 2 (34) of the 1989 Act, as amended with eff ect from 01.07.2004, provides that “railway servant” would include a member of the RPF appointed under clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 1957 Act. Therefore, by virtue of Section 2(1)(n)(i) of the 1923 Act read with Section 2(34) of the 1989 Act, a constable of RPF would be deemed a workman for the purposes of the 1923 Act. 13. It was argued that the phrase “armed forces of the Union” is not defi ned and, therefore, it would have to be interpreted in the context in which it was inserted in the statute. It was urged that the 1923 Act is a pre- independence statute. Prior to independence, instead of the phrase “armed forces of the Union”, “His Majesty’s naval, military or air forces” was used. Therefore, to assert the Republic status of the country, post the enforcement of the Constitution of India in the year 1950, replacement of that phrase was considered necessary and was done so by A.O. 1950 with eff ect from 26 January 1950. Thus, the phrase “armed forces of the Union” would have to be given a restrictive meaning in the context in which it has been inserted.
