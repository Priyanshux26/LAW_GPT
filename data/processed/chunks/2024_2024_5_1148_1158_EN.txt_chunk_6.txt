The objective is also to prevent multiple proceedings by parties in different forums. The principle is based on equity and good conscience. This Court has clarified this position in a catena of cases. Reference may be made here of some, such as: Rajendra Singh v. Santa Singh, AIR 1973 SC 2537; Dev Raj Dogra v. Gyan Chand Jain (1981) 2 SCC 675; Sunita Jugalkishore Gilda v. Ramanlal Udhoji Tanna (2013) 10 SCC 258. 17. It must be stated here though that by virtue of Section 1 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 the provisions of the said Act are not applicable in the States of Punjab, Delhi or Bombay; subject, of course to certain exceptions. Yet, in the case of Kanshi Ram v. Kesho Ram, AIR 1961 P&H 299 the Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that since the explanation to Section 52 is based on equity and good conscience this principle can be applicable. Recently, this Court in Shivshankara and Another v. H.P. Vedavyasa Char, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 358 held as follows: “….Even if it is taken for granted that the provisions under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act are not applicable as such in the case on hand it cannot be disputed that the principle contained in the provision is applicable in the case on hand. It is a well-nigh settled position that wherever TP Act is not applicable, such principle in the said provision of the said Act, which is based on justice, equity and good conscience is applicable in a given similar circumstance, like Court sale etc…..” [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1157 Chander Bhan (D) Through LR Sher Singh v. Mukhtiar Singh & Ors. In short, there can be no doubt that even if Section 52 of T.P Act is not applicable in its strict sense in the present case then too the principles of lis-pendens, which are based on justice, equity and good conscience, would certainly be applicable. 18. Keeping this in mind, the explanation to Section 52 which was inserted by the Act No. XX of 1929, clarifies that pendency of a suit shall be deemed to have commenced from the date on which the plaintiff presents the suit. Further, that such pendency would extend till a final decree is passed and such decree is realised. 19. In the facts of the present case, the suit for permanent injunction was filed on 21.07.2003 which is prior to the execution of release deed, i.e., 28.07.2003. Thus, since the release deed is executed after the suit for temporary injunction was filed by the appellant, the alienation made by respondent no. 3 in favour of respondent no. 4 would be covered by the doctrine of lis pendens. 20. In other words, the appellant filed a suit for permanent injunction on 21.07.2003 and obtained an of temporary injunction on 28.07.2003. As on 21.07.2003 the doctrine of lis pendens would take its effect. The release deed executed by respondent no. 3 in favour of respondent no.
