Per contra, learned senior counsel for the respondent/caveator submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the discretion employed by the Division Bench in allowing the taking on record of the Written Statement of the respondent is perfectly justified. He drew our attention to the Chapter IX Rules 24 and 3,5 Chapter X Rule 276 and Chapter XXXVIII Rule 46 of the Rules. In sum, his contention was that the High Court was empowered to enlarge/abridge the time, as had been done in the present case. It was further stated that the sequence of events and list of dates would show that there was neither any deliberate/wilful laches nor any lacuna on the part of the respondent in not filing the Written Statement on time, primarily on the ground that as early as on 01.03.2000, the status of the suit was shown as disposed of, which position is factually verified by the subsequent s of the High Court in the suit and by the reports submitted by its Registry.
