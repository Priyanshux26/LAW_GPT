The reasons as this Court have already indicated are two: firstly Pradeep Jain and all D the cases which follow Pradeep Jain deal only with medical education, and secondly the ratio as laid down in Pradeep Jain has also to be seen in the context of the time when it was delivered. In short, therefore, though this Court had to follow the principles as laid down in Pradeep Jain but at the same time this Court also have to keep in mind the ground realities of the present day. E This Court also have to keep in mind that this Court are presently not dealing with medical education but admission in a professional education course called B.Ed. [Paras 8, 12][111-F; 114-D-F] 3. This Court while upholding such reservations in medical education had considered factors such as huge investments the F State had made in creating the infrastructure, the backwardness of the area, the presumption that the local residents after gaining the education will serve the people of that State, etc. All these factors may or may not be equally relevant while this Court are considering admission to other courses such as B.Ed in the present case. [Para 13][114-G] G 4. It is apparent that the large percentage of seats reserved for the residents of Madhya Pradesh which remains unfilled is not serving any purpose. Moreover, a wholesale reservation for H 108 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A residents of Madhya Pradesh would also be violative of the law laid down in the case of Pradeep Jain, as this Court have referred above in this . [Para 17][116-D] 5. Keeping 75% of the seats reserved for the residents of Madhya Pradesh is too high a percentage, and as the figures for B the last two years indicate, it is also not serving any purpose. The number of seats from the next academic year shall, therefore be fixed again for residents and non-residents, keeping the observations made by this Court in this . This Court make it clear that though reservation in favour of residents is permissible, yet reservation to the extent of 75% of the total C seats makes it a wholesale reservation, which has been held in Pradeep Jain to be unconstitutional and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. A wholesale reservation as this Court have seen is not serving any purpose rather it frustrates the very purpose of the reservation. [Paras 18, 19][116-E-G] D Dr. Pradeep Jain and Others v.
