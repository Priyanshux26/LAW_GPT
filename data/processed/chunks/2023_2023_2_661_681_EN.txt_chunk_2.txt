Hence, the High Court went wrong in holding that as relates the said circumstantial evidence of ‘last seen’ the evidence of PW-8 gets corroboration from the evidence of PW-10 and in that view of the matter, in agreeing with the conclusion of the trial court that the F prosecution has succeeded in proving that the deceased was lastly seen with the accused, conclusively. [Para 25][678-G-H; 679-A- D] 1.5 It is unsafe to rest on the sole testimony of PW-8 to apply the ‘last seen theory’ in this case against the appellants G especially, going by PW-8 he had only nodding acquaintance with them. Thus, in a nutshell the correctness of the last seen version emanating from PW-8 becomes doubtful, especially against the appellants. The oral testimonies of PW-8 and PW-10 are at H 664 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A variance about the last seen and it becomes inconclusive for the reasons mentioned. The prosecution has miserably failed to prove the alleged motive. In such circumstance, though the deceased had met with a homicidal death it cannot be said that the rest of the circumstantial evidence culled out by the courts below unerringly point to the culpability of the appellants in the homicidal B death of the deceased. Even the recovery of the weapon and the dress, at the instance of the appellant in the latter appeal cannot, by itself, be conclusive as admittedly, the panch witnesses for their recovery also did not support the prosecution. The remaining circumstances relied on by the prosecution and held C as proved by the courts below would not unerringly point to the guilt of the appellants. Thus, it is unsafe on the said circumstances to maintain the conviction of the appellants; thus, the benefit of doubt is extended to them. The appellants are acquitted.
