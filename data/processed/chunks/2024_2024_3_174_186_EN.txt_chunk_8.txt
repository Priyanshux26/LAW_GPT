Section 4(3), which empowers Market Committees to establish markets within the notified area, also directs that these Market Committees have to provide facilities in the markets for the purchase and sale of notified products. Appellants’ argument that these Market Committees did not provide any facilities has already been dealt with and rejected by the High Court and we are also of the same view as that taken by the High Court. The appellants have availed the facility given by the Market Committee and hence they are liable to pay the fee. There may also be a question of unjust enrichment here. For all these reasons, we are of the opinion that this market fee should be paid as well. The appellants’ prayer that Respondent Market Committees should be restrained from collecting market fees prior to the date of the High Court cannot be accepted. All the same, since this fee which has now accumulated for more than 14 years between 05.07.1994 to 01.05.2009 may entail some hardship on the appellants, they shall be permitted to deposit this fee with the Committee within two years from today, in four equal instalments. 14. Consequently, we dismiss these appeals and uphold the majority decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The interim s 186 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports passed by this Court in the present batch of cases where we had restrained the respondents from collecting market fees prior to the date of the High Court during the pendency of these appeals, stand vacated.
