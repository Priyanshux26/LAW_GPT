Headnotes† Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Section 100 – Substantial question of law: Held: Unless substantial questions of law are formulated at the time of admission of the appeal, or any time subsequent thereto, a second appeal cannot be finally heard – The reason is that a second appeal can be heard only on a substantial question of law formulated earlier – The act of finally hearing a second appeal without framing any substantial question of law is itself illegal – The High Court could have framed substantial questions of law, and heard the appeal after a few days, so that the Advocates had notice that the appeal will be heard on specific substantial questions of law.
