It is always desirable that while making the appointment as Members of the District Fora and/or the State Commission there is a need to assess the skill, ability, and the competency of the candidates before they are empanelled and recommended to the State Government. The Rules, 2020 do not contemplate written examination so as to test the merits of the D candidate. In the case of UPCPBA (supra), this Court expressed deep concern over the bureaucratic and political interference in process of appointments. 6.6 At this stage, it is required to be noted that mechanism of having written examination was confirmed by this Court which has been E removed under the new Rules, 2020. 6.7 At this stage, it is required to be noted that earlier under Consumer Protection Act, 1986, there were Rules, 2017 in so far as some of the States are concerned and Rules, 2019 so far as the State of Maharashtra is concerned, which provided for a written examination F and viva voce, which was under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. 6.8 The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 has been repealed and the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has come into force w.e.f. 24.07.2020 with a sole intention to provide adequate safeguards to the consumers and the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Fora and State Commissions G are enhanced substantially. However, there is no substantial change in the scheme with respect to the adjudication of the consumer disputes. No justification at all is shown to do away with the written examination while framing the Rules, 2020 under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. Therefore, as rightly observed by the High Court, the Rule 6(9) of the Rules, 2020 is unconstitutional, arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of H THE SECRETARY MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS v. DR. 321 MAHINDRA BHASKAR LIMAYE [M. R. SHAH, J.] the Constitution of India, more particularly, when the same is wholly A impermissible to override/overrule the earlier decisions of this Court and that too without any justification. We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court. 7. Now so far as the Rule 3(2)(b) and Rule 4(2)(c) of the Rules, 2020 are concerned, the High Court has rightly quashed the said provisions B which provided for having a minimum 20 years’ experience for appointment as a Member in State Commission under Rule 3(2)(b) and having a minimum 15 years’ experience for appointment as a Member in District Commission under Rule 4(2)(c). 7.1 It is required to be noted that under provision 4(1) of Rules, C 2020, a person who is eligible to be appointed as a district judge (having minimum experience of 7 years) is qualified to be appointed as President of the District Commission but in to be appointed as a Member, Section 4(2)(c) mandates a minimum experience of 15 years which is rightly held to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. D 7.2 Similarly providing 20 years’ experience under Rule 3(2)(b) also rightly held to be arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
