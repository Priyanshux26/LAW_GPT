However, when a conferred right is withdrawn, modifi ed or altered, the process leading thereto should demonstrate application of mind, nexus to the object of such withdrawal or modifi cation and any such decision should be free of arbitrariness. In that background, the impugned notifi cation dated 04.03.2021 though competent under Section 7B(1) of Act, 1955 suff ers from the vice of non-application of mind and despite being prospective, is in fact ‘retroactive’ taking away the rights which were conferred also as a matter of policy of the Sovereign State. 59. Hence, the notifi cation being sustainable prospectively, we hereby declare that the impugned portion of the notifi cation which provides for supersession of the notifi cations dated 11.04.2005, 05.01.2007 and 05.01.2009 and the clause 4(ii), its proviso and Explanation (1) thereto shall operate prospectively in respect of OCI cardholders who have secured the same subsequent to 04.03.2021. 60. We further hold that the petitioners in all these cases and all other similarly placed OCI cardholders will be entitled to the rights and privileges which had been conferred on them earlier to the notifi cation dated 04.03.2021 and could be availed by them notwithstanding 956 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. the exclusion carved out in the notifi cation dated 04.03.2021. The participation of the petitioners and similarly placed OCI cardholders in the selection process and the subsequent action based on the interim s passed herein or elsewhere shall stand regularised.” 16. It is evident that the ruling held that notifi cation (dated 04.03.2021) operated arbitrarily because fi rstly it indicated non-application of mind in not saving accrued rights. The application of proviso to Clause 4 (ii) of the notifi cation of 04.03.2021 was held to have no nexus with the objects sought to be achieved. The court also held that those who are born prior to 2005 and residing in India had received their education in India and hadpursued by having some advantages and disadvantages like other children who are citizens of India, and could not be denied their right to participate in NEET examinations or such similar examinations. It was also held that no additional advantage was granted to such class of people merely because they were born abroad and importantly, court took note of the amendment which introduced concession to OCI Card holders. Therefore, the Court concluded that when the right conferred was withdrawn and altered, in the process leading to such change, should demonstrate application of mind, nexus to the object of such withdrawal or modifi cation and any such decision had to be free of arbitrariness. In the light of this conclusion, the court held that the notifi cation saved from the vice of non-application of mind and was in fact retroactive. It was in these circumstances that the Court held that only those persons who obtained OCI Cards after 04.03.2021 were rendered ineligible in terms of the notifi cation. 17. In the present case, although the OCI Card relied upon by the petitioner on 04.08.2022, the fact that she was in fact issued the OCI registration card fi rst, on 02.11.2015.In such circumstances, the petitioner’s eligibility to claim the benefi t of OCI card holder in terms of the ruling in Anushka (supra) is undeniable.
