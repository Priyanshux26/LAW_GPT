8.7 On 02.02.2016, the sub-committee appointed by GEAC convened its first meeting and in that meeting, it voiced concerns over the clarifications furnished by the CGMCP on the issues mentioned in para 3.3. However, in the 127th meeting of GEAC held on 05.02.2016, GEAC adopted the recommendations of the sub-committee and directed the CGMCP to revise the biosafety dossier, in light of the comments of the sub-committee and the biosafety unit, and prepare an RARM document for further review. It is stated that GEAC had decided to put the biosafety dossier in the public domain, but this was not carried out. 8.8 In its 128th Meeting held on 04.03.2016, GEAC decided to await the completion of the Biosafety Support Unit’s (BSU) review of the revised dossier before further consideration. On 11.04.2016, the sub-committee, in its 2nd Meeting, recommended incorporating expert comments and remarks from the Biosafety Unit into its report. The report was to be presented to GEAC and uploaded onto its website. In its 129th Meeting on 20.06.2016, GEAC noted the Sub-Committee’s request for an additional month to finalize recommendations. Subsequently, in its 130th Meeting, GEAC concluded that a report had been submitted by the sub-committee, titled “Assessment of Food and Environmental Safety (AFES)”. It was published on GEAC’s website for stakeholder comments within a period of 30 days. However, it was complained that the biosafety dossier was deliberately not disclosed on the website for public scrutiny. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1973 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. 8.9 On 07.09.2016, Dr. Bhargava, a member of GEAC, made a startling revelation. He stated that the so-called Report of the sub-committee titled “Assessment of Food and Environmental Safety” was never shared or discussed before GEAC. Following this revelation, on 22.09.2016, various scholars and public activists endorsed an email addressed to the Hon’ble Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The email raised serious objections to the conduct of the appraisal process, particularly the refusal to disclose the biosafety dossier to the general public. It urged the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) to extend the consultation process by another 120 days. In addition to the email, on 24.09.2016, eminent scholars and experts sent a letter to the Hon’ble Minister of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, expressing grave concerns regarding GEAC’s blatant refusal to disclose the biosafety data to the general public, hindering a meaningful exercise of public consultation. It also requested an extension of the consultation process for another 120 days. Despite objections and requests for transparency, it is stated that GEAC continued the consultation process, culminating in a comment note published on 30.09.2016, refusing to extend the consultation period and setting the deadline for receiving comments as 05.10.2016. 8.10 Challenging the appraisal procedure adopted by GEAC, the petitioner has preferred the writ petition before this Court, under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, primarily contending that the aforesaid procedure adopted by GEAC was not only arbitrary but also lacked proper application of mind, rendering it illegal and violative of the fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
