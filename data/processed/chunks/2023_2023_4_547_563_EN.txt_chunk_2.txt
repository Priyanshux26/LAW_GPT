The present appeal1 was heard finally, with the consent of counsel for parties. The appellants are aggrieved by the of the Kerala High Court2 rejecting their petition under Section 482, Criminal D Procedure Code, 1973 (hereafter “Cr. PC”). They had, through those proceedings, sought a direction to quash a criminal complaint instituted against them. I 2. The appellants urge that one P.M. Mammu Haji leased two E shop rooms (numbered as municipal numbers VII/214 and VII/215- hereafter “the premises”), long ago (in 1916), before the coming into force of the Wakf Act. “Norman Printing Bureau” (hereafter “the Bureau”) was a concern of Achuthan Nair; it was functioning in the premises. A partnership firm was later created, with one P.V. Sami as a F partner. The firm continued all these years and continues now. The Bureau publishes ‘Norman Almanac’ containing astronomical data used in astrology. 3. The respondents allege that P.M. Mammu Haji created a wakf in 1951. After his death, a suit was filed by his legal heirs (O.S. No. 130/ G 1965 before the Sub Court, Calicut) to remove the trustee. There was an existing dispute even between the legal heirs of Mammu Haji whether there was a Wakf or a trust. In that suit, the court found that Mammu Haji created a private Trust; it removed the existing trustee. In between, 1 Crl. A. No. 309/2023. H 2 Dated 03.03.2016 in Crl. MC No. 5072/2015. P. V. NIDHISH & ORS. v. KERALA STATE WAKF BOARD & 551 ANR. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] the rent for the premises was increased, and a Rent Enhancement Deed A was executed between the parties, on 15.09.1973. The appellants noticed uncertainty on account of lack of clarity about ownership of the premises and filed an interpleader suit on 30.03.1998 before the Munsiff court, Kozhikode. That suit was transferred to the file of the District Judge (OS 147/2001)where the court decreed the suit and directed the appellants B to pay rent to the third defendant. 4. The CEO of the Board initiated several proceedings against the appellants for eviction. The first attempt, in 2004, resulted in an 3 of the Wakf Board to the effect that the appellants were not in unauthorized occupation and could be evicted after issuing notice under C provisions of the Transfer of Property Act. Another proceeding (OS 13/ 2006) was filed before the Wakf Tribunal against the appellant firm’s manager, for its eviction. This was decreed; but in revision proceedings4, the Kerala High Court ruled that the Wakf Tribunal lacked jurisdiction and the appellants could be evicted only through a civil proceeding before a competent civil court.
