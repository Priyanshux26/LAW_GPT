In other words, Steria’s plea that Clause 7 of the Protocol did not require any separate notifi cation and could straightway be operationalised, was not accepted by the AAR. Upon challenge in a writ petition before the High Court, this was reversed; the court accepted Steria’s contention, and held that a Protocol is considered as part of the treaty itself and does not have to be separately notifi ed for the purposes of application of the MFN clause. Therefore, in Steria, the question for the interpretation of the MFN clause in the Protocol to the India-France DTAA, was whether a separate notifi cation by the Union was required for application of the MFN clause. The AAR had concluded that even though the conditions set out in the MFN clause were satisfi ed, the benefi t could not be availed unless there was a specifi c notifi cation by the Government of India eff ectuating the benefi t under the MFN clause, which the High Court reversed. 3. The next set of facts, relate to the India-Netherlands DTAA which was entered into on 21.01.1989, and notifi ed on 27.03.1989. This DTAA was amended by a subsequent notifi cation dated 30.08.1999. The respondent assessees (writ petitioners before the High Court2) were Concentrix Services Netherlands BV, and Optum Global Solutions International BV, and their Indian counterparts (in which the former held 99.99% share respectively) which remitted dividends. In 2020, Concentrix India and Optum India 2 dated 22.04.2021 passed by the Delhi High Court in W.P. (C) No.9051/2020 and connected matters. ASSESSING OFFICER CIRCLE (INTERNATIONAL TAXATION) 2(2)(2) 1147 NEW DELHI v. M/S NESTLE SA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] each applied under Section 197 of the Act in the prescribed form, seeking a certifi cate that authorized them to deduct withholding tax at a lower rate of 5% in consonance with the subject DTAA read with the Protocol. In both cases, certifi cates were issued on 16.09.2020 and 04.01.2021 respectively by which the stipulated withholding tax rate was shown as 10%. In both cases, the certifi cates were valid till 30.03.2021. The validity period of the certifi cates came to an end on 31.03.2021 in both cases. By communication dated 17.09.2020, Concentrix, through its accountants, sought permission of respondents to inspect the fi les as well as copies of sheet(s) which concerned processing of its application preferred under Section 197 of the Act. It also sought reasons why the certifi cate did not grant the withholding rate at 5%. The respondent sought to justify its certifi cate on 01.10.2020, and applied seeking reasons from the appellant (hereafter “the revenue”). A similar request was made by Optum Netherlands; the revenue furnished reasons to justify the withholding tax rate which was pegged at 10% by its communication dated 22.01.2021. Feeling aggrieved, both Concentrix Ne and Optum Ne approached the Delhi High Court, in proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution. 4. In both cases, the assessees contended that regard being had to the phraseology of the DTAA and the subsequent Protocol, the relevant event relied upon – the provisions of the DTAA and the Protocol, obliged the revenue to extend the lower rate of 5%.
