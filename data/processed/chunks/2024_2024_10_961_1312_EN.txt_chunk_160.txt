While IM(D)Ts took up cases of suspected foreigners of the post March 25th 1971 stream, the existing Foreigners Tribunals were entrusted with the responsibility of disposing of cases pertaining to pre-March 25th 1971 stream of suspected foreigners.” (Emphasis supplied) 105. It can be seen from the above that the detection of foreigners gained pace on the commencement of the student-led agitation in Assam. It could be presumed that certain number of immigrants of the 1966-71 stream would have either been detected and deported prior to the enactment of Section 6A in 1985, or might have left Assam apprehending such detection and deportation. However, even after taking into consideration such variations, the data on the number of immigrants detected by virtue of Section 6A, as presented to us by the Union of India, is not commensurate to the extent of influx that took place during the relevant period. 1188 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Number of immigrants belonging to the 1966-71 stream detected/ registered: S. Particulars White Paper Affidavit dated No. on Foreigner’s 11.12.2023 Issue (October, filed by the 2012) Union of India 1. Number of immigrants 32,537 Not Applicable of the 1966-71 stream declared as foreigners between 1985 - July, 2012 2. Number of immigrants Not Applicable 32,381 of the 1966-71 stream declared as foreigners by an of the Foreigners Tribunal (till 31.10.2023) 3. Number of immigrants Not Available 17,861 belonging to the 1966- (persons who 71 stream to whom had registered citizenship has been with the FRRO granted under Section till 31.10.2023) 6A(3) Note: Although the white paper was published in 2012, yet the number of immigrants of the 1966-71 stream who have been detected as foreigners indicated therein is higher than that indicated in the Affidavit dated 11.12.2023. 106. As is evident from the table above, the number of immigrants belonging to the 1966-71 stream and detected as “foreigner” is significantly smaller in comparison to the approximate number of immigrants who had entered into Assam from Bangladesh between 01.01.1966 and 24.03.1971. This, in my considered opinion, doesn’t appear to be solely due to the inadequate implementation of Section 6A, but rather due to the inherent and manifest arbitrariness in the [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1189 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 mechanism prescribed under the provision, which I shall elaborate upon in later parts of this . c. oBject Sought to Be achieveD By the preScription of two Separate cut-off DateS 107. From the aforesaid discussion, it is clear that Section 6A creates three categories of immigrants by prescribing two distinct cut-off dates. The first two categories of immigrants are those who had immigrated on or before 24.03.1971 (i.e., those entitled to citizenship), and the third category consists of those who immigrated into Assam after 24.03.1971 and are considered as illegal immigrants who are liable to be deported. However, a different mechanism has been prescribed for acquisition of citizenship even within the first two classes, as indicated by the following table: CATEGORY I – CATEGORY II – CATEGORY III – Immigrants who came Immigrants who came Immigrants who came before 01.01.1966 between after 24.03.1971 01.01.1966 – 24.03.1971 Governed by Section Governed by Section Not entitled to citizenship 6A(2) of the Citizenship 6A(3) of the Citizenship under Section 6A of the Act.
