The language used in the amended section specifi cally incorporates the words as “substantial question of law” which is indicative of the legislative intention. It must be clearly understood that the legislative intention was very clear that legislature never wanted second appeal to become “third trial on facts” or “one more dice in the gamble”. The eff ect of the amendment mainly, according to the amended section, was: (i) The High Court would be justifi ed in admitting the second appeal only when a substantial question of law is involved; (ii) The substantial question of law to precisely state such question; (iii) A duty has been cast on the High Court to formulate substantial question of law before hearing the appeal; (iv) Another part of the section is that the appeal shall be heard only on that question.” Gurdev Kaur (supra) was referred to and relied upon in Randhir Kaur v. Prithvi Pal Singh & Ors.11 13.3 In Santosh Hazari v. Purushottam Tiwari12 a Bench of three Judges, held as under in regard to what constitutes a substantial question of law:- a) Not previously settled by law of land or a binding precedent. 11 (2019) 17 SCC 71; Two Judge Bench 12 (2001) 3 SCC 179 Three Judge Bench SURESH LATARUJI RAMTEKE v. SAU. SUMANBAI 497 PANDURANG PETKAR [SANJAY KAROL J.] b) Material bearing on the decision of case; and (c) New point raised for the fi rst time before the High Court is not a question involved in the case unless it goes to the root of the matter. Therefore, it will depend on facts of each case. Such principles stand followed in Government of Kerala v. Joseph13 and Chandrabhan v. Saraswati14. 13.4 Non-formulation of substantial question(s) of law renders proceedings “patently illegal”. This Court’s decisions in Umerkhan v. Bimillabi15 and Shiv Cotex v. Tirgun Auto Plast Pvt Ltd. & Ors.16 indicate this position. 14. Substantial questions of law, as framed by the High Court must be answered in light of the contentions raised therein. 14.1 If the Court is of the view that a question framed is to be altered, deleted or a new question is to be added, then the Court must hear the parties. 14.2 For both the above principles, reference may be made to Gajaraba Bhikhubha Vadher v. Sumara Umar Amad1 7 where the following principles were observed: - a) The substantial question of law framed by the High Court must be answered, with reasons. Disposing off the appeal without answering the same cannot be justifi ed. b) If a need is felt to modify, alter or delete a question, a hearing must be provided to the parties in respect thereof. 14.3 When the case is admitted, but upon hearing when it is found that no substantial question of law arises for consideration, reasons should be recorded in such dismissal. 13 2023 SCC OnLine SC 961 Two Judge Bench 14 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1273 Two Judge Bench 15 (2011) 9 SCC 684 Two Judge Bench 16 (2011) 9 SCC 678 Two Judge Bench 17 (2020) 11 SCC 114 (Three Judge Bench) 498 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R.
