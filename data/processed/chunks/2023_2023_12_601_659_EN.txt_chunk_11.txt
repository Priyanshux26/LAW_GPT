land to M.A. Baksh through GPA, who in turn sold the land to subsequent purchasers in the form of smaller plots. These transaction(s) were held to be in contravention of Section 3(1), 3(2), 3(3) and 3(4) of the 1977 Act and accordingly, the Subject Land was ed to be resumed under Section 4 thereof. It would also be relevant to mention that the resumption dated 27.01.2007 also noticed that most of the Subject Land was still fallow and unsuitable for cultivation as it was covered by large boulders/rocks. 23. The Appellants assailed the resumption dated 27.01.2007 before the High Court in a writ petition which came to be decided in their favour by a learned Single Judge vide dated 05.02.2010 primarily on two grounds – fi rstly that the Second SCN and the resumption dated 27.01.2007 raised the identical issues in respect of Subject Land which stood already decided by the High Court vide its dated 21.04.2006. Hence, proceedings emanating from the Second SCN were barred by the principle of res judicata and an abuse of process of law; secondly that the assignments were governed by the Laoni Rules of 1950 instead by the subsequent GOM 1122, as possession stood granted way back in 1940 much earlier than the date GOM 1122 came into force. It is also useful to mention that accordingly to the learned Single Judge, the liberty granted in the previous High Court dated 21.04.2006 regarding cancellation of Subject Land was only concerned with `future contravention’ of the assignment conditions. 24. Being piqued on account of the of the learned Single Judge, the State preferred an intra-court appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court. The said writ appeal has been allowed in the Respondents’ favour via the impugned judgement whereby the resumption dated 27.01.2007 stands upheld for the following reasons: – a) The proceedings under the Second SCN were not hit by the doctrine of res judicata or constructive res judicata, as the same concerned the sale deeds executed by M.A. Baksh and the consequent action under the 1977 Act, which was not an issue decided by the High Court vide its dated 21.04.2006 whereby the First SCN was set aside. b) The learned Single Judge had erroneously construed the liberty granted in the dated 21.04.2006 in respect of fresh cancellation proceedings to be only for future violation YADAIAH AND ANR. v. STATE OF TELANGANA AND 619 OTHERS [SURYA KANT, J.] of assignment conditions as no such inference could be drawn from the wording of the said . It was also held that this interpretation virtually amounted to re-writing the dated 21.04.2006, especially in view of the fact that the review petition against the same, seeking to delete the relevant part granting liberty was specifi cally dismissed by the High Court. c) The Subject Land was not alienable either under the Laoni Rules of 1950 or under the revised land assignment rules of 1958 and hence it comes under the defi nition of ‘assigned land’ as provided in the 1977 Act.
