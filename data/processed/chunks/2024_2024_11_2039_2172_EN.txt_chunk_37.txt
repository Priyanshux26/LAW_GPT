Therefore, the Effective Date was finally frozen on 25.05.2022. 48. The learned ASG submitted that the SRA, however, contended that the Effective Date had been achieved on 20.05.2022 and the same was accepted by the NCLT in its dated 13.01.2023. Therefore, the calculation of 180 days for the infusion of the First Tranche Payment begins from 20.05.2022. The initial 180 days had expired on 16.11.2022. However, several extensions were given to the SRA for infusion of the first tranche payment – Firstly, vide dated 13.01.2023, the NCLT extended the timeline for infusion of First Tranche Payment till 15.05.2023; Secondly, vide dated 26.05.2023, the NCLAT further extended the timeline of 180 days till 31.08.2023; Thirdly, vide dated 28.08.2023, the NCLAT extended the timeline of 180 days till 30.09.2023 and; Fourthly, vide dated 18.01.2024, this Court extended the time of 180 days for infusion till 31.01.2024. 49. The learned ASG highlighted that Respondent No.1 had failed to make the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore, airport dues of Rs. 475 Crore and the workmen’s and employees’ dues of Rs. 226 Crore within the initial 180 days from the Effective Date as well as within the multiple extensions granted by the NCLT, NCLAT and this Court. The ASG submitted that multiple extensions and accommodations have already been granted to the SRA for implementation of the Resolution Plan. Therefore, it is too late in the day to claim that the non-infusion of Rs. 150 Crore to complete the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore is only a breach of the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 and not the Resolution Plan. The same needs to be rejected outrightly. v. Issue No. 5: Non-fulfilment of Conditions Precedent 50. The ASG submitted that the respondents have failed to comply with 3 Conditions Precedent, specifically under Clauses 7.6.1(a), (c) and (d) of the Resolution Plan respectively. 51. It was submitted that Clause 7.6.1 (a) requires the SRA to obtain an AOC which has to be validated by the DGCA and the Ministry [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2097 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. of Civil Aviation (hereinafter, “MoCA”). The Respondent possessed an AOC on 20.05.2022 i.e., the Effective Date as contended by the SRA. The validity of the AOC was further extended by the DGCA on 27.07.2023 up to 03.09.2023 subject to certain conditions. It was clearly stated that the extension is only for the limited purpose of completing the ongoing CIRP process and the Corporate Debtor would be required to undergo fresh re-certification in accordance with the prescribed procedure for issuance of an AOC and also submit a firm action plan for the revival of its operations. The AOC expired on 03.09.2023 and the same was never extended by the SRA. 52. It was submitted that the NCLT in its dated 13.01.2023 had recorded a finding that the Condition Precedent with respect to the AOC was fulfilled but it must be noted that this was an observation made during a time when the SRA had a valid subsisting AOC, which subsequently expired.
