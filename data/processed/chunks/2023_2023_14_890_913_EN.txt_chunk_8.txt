10.1 In Chacko v. State of Kerala17 this court declined to accept a dying declaration made by a person, 70 years of age, having sustained 80% burns. Therein, the declaration was recorded 8-9 hours after burns, giving minute details as to motive and manner. It was opined that the condition of the patient described as “conscious, talking” in the wound certifi cate would in and of itself not testify to the condition of the patient making such declaration, nor would the oral evidence of the doctor or Investigating Offi cer. 10.2 In P.V. Radhakrishna v. State of Karnataka 18 it was observed that there cannot be any hard and fast rule, lending itself to uniform application on the question whether the percentage of burns suff ered is a determinative factor to aff ect the credibility of the dying declaration. The same 17 (2003) 1 SCC 112(2-Judge Bench) 18 (2003) 6 SCC 443(2-Judge Bench) 904 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. would depend on the nature of the burns, the body parts aff ected, and the eff ect thereof on mental faculties, as well as other factors. 10.3 In Surinder Kumar v. State of Haryana19 the dying declaration made by a person having 95-97% burn injuries was not accepted given that at the time of making the declaration, the deceased was under the infl uence of Fortwin and Pethidine injections, because of which she could not have had normal alertness. 11. This Court in Uttam(supra) followed the principle as held in Khushal Rao v. State of Bombay20 that in to test the reliability of a dying declaration, the court has to keep in view, the circumstances like the opportunity of the dying man for observation, for example, whether there was suffi cient light if the crime was committed at night; whether the capacity of the man to remember the fact stated, had not been impaired at the time he was making the statement, by circumstances beyond his control; that the statement has been consistent throughout if he had several opportunities of making a dying declaration apart from the offi cial record of it; and that the statement had been made at the earliest opportunity and was not the result of tutoring by interested parties. 12. Having meditated on the above-extracted principles, we now proceed to examine them in the instant facts. 13.
