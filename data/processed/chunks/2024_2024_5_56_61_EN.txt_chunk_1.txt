The facts leading up to the present case are as follows: 3.1 On 20.05.2005, an FIR registered as Capital P.S. Case No. 178 of 2005 was lodged by the then Special Secretary to the Government in the General Administration (G.A.) Department, alleging a widespread conspiracy involving the forgery of documents to facilitate the illegal transfer of valuable government land to private entities. Following the FIR, the Police initiated investigations that culminated in a chargesheet filed against ten individuals, including the present respondents, accusing them of engaging in a criminal conspiracy under sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 477A, 120B and 34 IPC. 3.2 The chargesheet dated 28.08.2015 detailed that the respondents, along with other co-conspirators, allegedly utilized forged documents such as Hata Patas, Ekpadia, and rent receipts to manipulate judicial processes and revenue records to illegally acquire government lands. These documents were purportedly produced in various revenue and civil courts to secure favorable s, which were then used to substantiate false claims of ownership over the disputed properties. 3.3 Central to the allegations is a transaction involving the sale of land situated in the heart of Bhubaneshwar, initially leased to one Kamala Devi under dubious circumstances before the 1 In short, ‘IPC’ [2024] 5 S.C.R. 59 The State of Odisha v.

After her demise, her legal heir, Kishore Chandra Patnaik, continued to assert rights over the property based on this lease, which had been previously declared non-genuine by the competent authorities. Despite adverse findings, the OEA Collector and subsequent judicial rulings set aside earlier decisions and reinstated the lease, albeit amidst allegations of document manipulation and improper legal proceedings. 3.4 In the year 2000, Kishore Chandra Patnaik, through a General Power of Attorney2, granted Anup Kumar Dhirsamant (accused no. 5), a real estate developer, the authority to manage and dispose of the property. It is alleged that this GPA was later found to be interpolated towards transactions favourable to the Respondents and the other accused persons. Following the interpolation, Dhirsamant executed sales of substantial portions of the land to the respondents at rates grossly undervalued, as per the market rates at the time and transactions that were finalized without proper scrutiny of the title’s legitimacy or the GPA’s authenticity.
