[Para 44] Doctrines/Principles – Doctrine of Public Trust and Public Accountability: Held: Executive exercises its powers as a ‘trustee’ of the citizens and therefore, executive actions must be consistent with maintaining public trust – When executive acts in breach of principles of ‘rule 728 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of law’ and ‘separation of powers’, doctrine of public trust and accountability would come into play. [Paras 45, 46] Rights of accused – Protection from arbitrary State action – Institutional accountability: Held: The State and its officials cannot take arbitrary and excessive measures against the accused or for that matter even against the convicts without following the due process as sanctioned by law – When the right of an accused or a convict is violated on account of illegal or arbitrary exercise of power by the State or its officials or on account of their negligence, inaction, or arbitrary action, there has to be an institutional accountability – One of the measures for redressing the grievance for violation of a right would be to grant compensation – At the same time, if any of the officers of the State has abused his powers or acted in a totally arbitrary or malafide manner, he cannot be spared for such an illegal, arbitrary, malafide exercise of power. [Para 62] Criminal Law – Fairness in criminal justice system – Presumption of innocence and natural justice: Held: The principle, that the criminal justice process is also to be in accordance with the principle of the rule of law, is very well enshrined in the Constitution – The principle, that “an accused is not guilty unless proven so in a court of law” is foundational to any legal system – It reflects the presumption of innocence, which means that every person accused of a crime is considered innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a court of law – This principle ensures that individuals are not unfairly punished or stigmatized based solely on accusations or suspicions – The right to a fair trial is essential in upholding the rule of law and protecting individual liberties – It ensures that the principles of natural justice and fair process are being strictly followed – An accused cannot be declared guilty, unless proven so beyond reasonable doubt before a court of law – They cannot be declared guilty, unless there is a fair trial.
