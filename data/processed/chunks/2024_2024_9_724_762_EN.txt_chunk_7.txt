In Noor Aga’s case, this Court 2 [2008] 10 SCR 379 : (2008) 16 SCC 417 3 [2006] Supp. 10 SCR 729 : (2006) 13 SCC 305 4 [2009] 7 SCR 977 : (2009) 13 SCC 729 734 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports observed and held that superficially a case might have an ugly look and thereby, prima facie, shaking the conscious of any court. But it is well settled that suspicion, however high it might be, could under no circumstances be held to be substitute for legal evidence. 14. There can be little doubt with respect to the position that a Court is bound to appreciate the defence evidence in the same manner as it is to appreciate the prosecution evidence, in a criminal case. In V. Venkata Subbarao’s case, this Court held that the burden as an accused did not have to meet the same standards of proof as is required to be met by the prosecution. In Vishnu Dutt Sharma’s case, this Court held that the prosecution is bound to prove the commission of the offence on the part of the accused beyond any reasonable doubt. Certainly, the requirement to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt does not mean that the degree of proof on the part of the prosecution must be one beyond a shadow of doubt (see the decision in Iqbal Moosa Patel v. State of Gujarat5). 15. The principle as to what degree of proof is required, is stated by Lord Denning in Miller v. Minister of Pensions,6 thus: - “…that degree is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with sentence, “of course it is possible, but not in the least probable” the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.” 16. The reasons for my remarks, as above, would be unravelled by the following critical examination of the impugned common and also appreciation of evidence, in that regard. 17. The of the trial Court would reveal that the finger print test conducted for identification of the dead body was accepted and acted upon. The trial Court held in paragraph 59 of its 5 [2011] 2 SCR 121 : (2011) 2 SCC 198 6 (1947) 2 All ER 372 [2024] 9 S.C.R. 735 Manik & Ors. v. The State of Maharashtra that the finger prints of Shama @ Kalya are identical with the finger prints of unknown dead body, is acceptable. “Had Shama @ Kalya not been criminal, whose record slips would not have been available, there was no chance of identification of dead body”, the trial Court further held thus in paragraph 101 of its .
