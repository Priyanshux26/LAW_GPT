Educational Services [B.K. Educational Services (P) Ltd. v. Paras Gupta & Associates, (2019) 11 SCC 633], and held that the winding-up petition H 208 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A filed beyond three years from the date of default was barred by time. 34.1. Even in the later decisions, this Court has consistently applied the declaration of law in B.K. Educational Services [B.K. Educational Services (P) Ltd. v. Paras Gupta & B Associates, (2019) 11 SCC 633]. As noticed, in Vashdeo R. Bhojwani [Vashdeo R. Bhojwani v. Abhyudaya Coop. Bank Ltd., (2019) 9 SCC 158], this Court rejected the contention suggesting continuing cause of action for the purpose of application under Section 7 of the Code while holding that the limitation started ticking from the date of issuance of C recovery certificate dated 24-12-2001. Again, in Gaurav Hargovindbhai Dave [Gaurav Hargovindbhai Dave v. Asset Reconstruction Co. (India) Ltd., (2019) 10 SCC 572], where the date of default was stated in the application under Section 7 of the Code to be the date of NPA i.e. 21-7-2011, this Court D held that the limitation began to run from the date of NPA and hence, the application filed under Section 7 of the Code on 3-10-2017 was barred by limitation. 38. The question as to whether date of enforcement of the Code (i.e. 1-12-2016) provides the starting point of limitation E for an application under Section 7 of the Code and hence, the application in question, made in the year 2018, is within limitation, is not even worth devoting much time. A bare look at para 21 of the impugned [Babulal Vardhaji Gurjar v. Veer Gurjar Aluminium Industries (P) Ltd., 2019 SCC OnLine NCLAT 295] leaves nothing to guess that such F observations by the Appellate Tribunal had only been assumptive in nature without any foundation and without any basis. There is nothing in the Code to even remotely indicate if the period of limitation for the purpose of an application under Section 7 is to commence from the date of commencement G of the Code itself. Similarly, nothing provided in the Limitation Act could be taken as the basis to support the proposition so stated by the Appellate Tribunal. In fact, such observations had been in the teeth of law declared by this Court in B.K. Educational Services [B.K. Educational Services (P) Ltd. v. Paras Gupta & Associates, (2019) 11 SCC 633]. H SABARMATI GAS LIMITED v. SHAH ALLOYS LIMITED 209 [C. T. RAVIKUMAR, J.] 38.1. It appears that at the given point of time, NCLAT had A been readily adopting such a proposition in other cases too, so as to treat similar applications within limitation. This approach of NCLAT was specifically disapproved by this Court in Sagar Sharma [Sagar Sharma v. Phoenix ARC (P) Ltd., (2019) 10 SCC 353] where, after observing that in B.K. B Educational Services [B.K. Educational Services (P) Ltd. v. Paras Gupta & Associates, (2019) 11 SCC 633] it had already been made clear that the date of the Code’s coming into force on 1-12-2016 was wholly irrelevant to the triggering of any limitation period for the purposes of the Code, this Court said : (Sagar Sharma case [Sagar Sharma v. Phoenix ARC C (P) Ltd., (2019) 10 SCC 353], SCC p. 354, para 3) “3.
