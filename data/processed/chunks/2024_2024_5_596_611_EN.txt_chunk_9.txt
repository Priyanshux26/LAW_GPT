The reason for remand, as is seen from the dated 10th March, 2016, was that the High Court had not considered that the Act would be applicable to the parties, which were the very same as the parties before us. In other words, the scope of remand was limited. The of the Inspector of Labour was passed under the Act. Since the High Court concluded that the Act would apply, there was no reason for it to disturb the finding of the Inspector of Labour and, therefore, it ought to have simply ed that the of Inspector of Labour which concluded that the members of the respondent-Union be given permanent employment, be complied with. When an issue stands already decided and such decision does not suffer from any vice of authority or jurisdiction then, putting those who enjoy an in their favour through the wringer once more of having to re-establish their claim, this time before the authority under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, would be unjustified. 29. The appeal filed by the Corporation (Appeal arising out of SLP(C) No.30005 of 2019) is, in terms of the above, dismissed and the appeal filed by the respondent-Union through its President, G. Sumathi (Appeal arising out of SLP(C)No.2649 of 2020) is accordingly allowed with all consequences in favour of the respondent-employees, under the law, to follow. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal filed by the Corporation dismissed. Appeal filed by the Union allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
