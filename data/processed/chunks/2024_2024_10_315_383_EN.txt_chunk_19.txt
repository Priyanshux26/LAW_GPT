It is only after the authority having been handed this task, is of the considered view that sanction can be granted, should it be so done. 27. The procedures qua sanctions provided in such legislations are meant to be followed strictly, to the letter more so to the spirit. Even the slightest of variation from the written word may render the proceedings arising therefrom to be cast in doubt. The general principle, when the provision is couched negatively has been noticed by this court in Rangku Dutta v. State of Assam 29 in the following terms: “18. It is obvious that Section 20-A(1) is a mandatory requirement of law. First, it starts with an overriding clause and, thereafter, to emphasise its mandatory nature, it uses the expression “No” after the overriding clause. Whenever the intent of a statute is mandatory, it is clothed with a negative command. Reference in this connection can be made to G.P. Singh’s Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 12th Edn., at pp. 404-05, the learned author has stated: “… As stated by Crawford: ‘Prohibitive or negative words can rarely, if ever, be directory. And this is so even though the statute provides 28 Hereinafter referred as ‘TADA’ 29 [2011] 8 SCR 639 : (2011) 6 SCC 358 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 345 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. no penalty for disobedience.’ As observed by Subbarao, J.: ‘Negative words are clearly prohibitory and are ordinarily used as a legislative device to make a statute imperative.’ Section 80 and Section 87-B of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; Section 77 of the Railways Act, 1890; Section 15 of the Bombay Rent Act, 1947; Section 213 of the Succession Act, 1925; Section 5-A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947; Section 7 of the Stamp Act, 1899; Section 108 of the Companies Act, 1956; Section 20(1) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954; Section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972; the proviso to Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (as amended in 1956); Section 10-A of the Medical Council Act, 1956 (as amended in 1993), and similar other provisions have therefore, been construed as mandatory. A provision requiring ‘not less than three months’ notice’ is also for the same reason mandatory.” We are in respectful agreement with the aforesaid statement of law made by the learned author.” For instance, under the TADA, it has been held that if the sanctioning authority as mentioned under Section 20-A is not the one who granted sanction and instead it was a higher authority, even then the said sanction would be illegal. Reference in this regard may be made to Hussein Ghadially v. State of Gujarat 30 and State of Rajasthan v. Mohinuddin Jamal Alvi.31 28. Now turning to the procedure for sanction provided under the UAPA, we find that a Court is enjoined from taking cognizance without previous sanction either by the Central Government or the State Government, as applicable, and such sanction shall only be given after the report of the authority appointed by the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, has been considered.
