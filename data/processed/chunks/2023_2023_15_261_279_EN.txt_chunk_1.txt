Leave granted. 2. The appellant before this Court has been convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge, Barabanki in Sessions Trial No.85 of 1996 for off ences under Sections 302 and 307 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and has been sentenced to life imprisonment under Section 302/34 and rigorous imprisonment for 7 years under Section 307/34 with default stipulations. The conviction and sentence of the appellant was upheld in appeal by the High Court, in its dated 07.05.2019. 3. There were four accused in the case, which were Gaya Prasad Mishra, Gulab Chandra, Pawan Kumar and Babadeen. The accused Babadeen passed away during the trial and his case stood abated and the remaining three were convicted for the off ences as stated above. The said conviction has been upheld by the High Court of Judicature of Allahabad (Lucknow Bench). Meanwhile, as far as Gaya Prasad Mishra and Gulab Chandra are concerned, who are the father and brother of the present appellant respectively, they were released prematurely after remaining in jail for more than 19 years, under the remission policy of the State. Consequently, they have not fi led any petition before this Court. 4. The appellant before this Court apart from challenging the impugned on merits has also raised a claim of being a juvenile at the time of the alleged commission of the crime (dated 01.12.1995), a plea which has been dismissed by the Trial Court and the High Court. 5. Before us, the learned counsel for the appellant, Ms. Vanshaja Shukla has submitted that the plea of juvenility may be considered fi rst as the claim of the appellant indeed was that at the time of the incident, he was a juvenile and his plea of juvenility had not been considered in the true letter and spirit of the applicable law. Consequently, before going through the case on its merits, we have heard the counsel for the appellant at length on the plea of juvenility. 264 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 6. We must state at the very outset that the appellant has been raising the claim of juvenility right since the time of his trial, although belatedly.
