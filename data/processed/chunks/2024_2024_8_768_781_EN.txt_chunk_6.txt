Merchant (Supra) would prevail. 2.9. Subsequently, a co-ordinate bench of this Court, noticed a conflict of opinion(s) in inter alia New India Assurance 1 (Supra); J.J. Merchant (Supra); Kailash (Supra); Salem Advocate Bar Association v. Union of India, (2005) 6 SCC 778 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 344; and Topline Shoes Limited v. Corporation Bank, (2002) 6 SCC 33, and accordingly, referred the matter to Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate s. In this context, vide an dated 30.10.2017, the instant appeal came to be placed before a Constitution Bench of this Court, with a view to bring a sense of finality vis-à-vis the underlying legal question vis-à-vis the manner of operation of Section 13 of the Act (the “Constitution Bench”). Pertinently, the Constitution Bench vide its decision in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (A) Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 757 (hereinafter “New India Assurance 2”) categorically observed that the rigours of Section 13 of the Act needed to be complied with mandatorily; however, on account of various conflicting decision(s) of this Court, the Constitution Bench clarified that New India Assurance 2 (Supra) would operate prospectively. 2.10. Pertinently, during the pendency of New India Assurance 2 (Supra), a Division Bench of this Court in Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mampee Timbers & Hardwares (P) Ltd., (2021) 3 SCC 673 held that the consumer fora were permitted to accept written statements beyond the stipulated maximum 45 (forty-five) day period in an appropriate case on suitable terms. This position was followed by this Court pursuant to the New India Assurance 2 (Supra) in respect of application(s)seeking condonation of delay in filing the written statements/reply that either had been decided or were pending prior to 04.03.2020 i.e., the date of pronouncement of New India Assurance 2 (Supra).1 2.11. Despite the aforesaid, a divergent view came to be taken by a Division Bench of this Court in Daddy’s Builders (A) Ltd. v. Manisha Bhargava, (2021) 3 SCC 669 observed as under: “7. As observed by the National Commission that despite sufficient time granted the written statement was not filed within the prescribed period of limitation. 1 Refer: A. Suresh Kumar v. Amit Agarwal, (2021)7 SCC 466; and Bhasin Infotech & Infrastructure (P) Ltd. v. Neema Agarwal, (2021) 18 SCC 301 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 779 Dr. Vijay Dixit & Ors. v. Pagadal Krishna Mohan & Ors. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd. Therefore, the National Commission has considered the aspect of condonation of delay on merits also. In any case,in view of the earlier decision of this Court in J.J. Merchant [J.J. Merchant v. Shrinath Chaturvedi, (2002) 6 SCC 635] and the subsequent authoritative decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage(P) Ltd. [New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage(P) Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 757 : (2020) 3 SCC (Civ) 338] , Consumer Fora have no jurisdiction and/or power to accept the written statement beyond the period of 45 days, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned [Daddy’s Builders (P) Ltd. v. Manisha Bhargava, 2020 SCC OnLine NCDRC 697] passed by the learned National Commission.” 2.12.
