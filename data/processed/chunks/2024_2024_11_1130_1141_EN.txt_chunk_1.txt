The plaintiff is the undisputed owner of this land. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1133 Leela Agrawal v. Sarkar & Anr. 4.2 In 1990, the plaintiff, in need of funds, approached the defendant and mortgaged the suit land for a sum of ₹75,000. A mortgage deed was executed and registered on 17.10.1990. 4.3 The plaintiff contends that it was orally agreed that she could redeem the mortgage within three years by repaying a total sum of ₹1,20,000, which included the principal amount, interest, and expenses. She remained in possession of the suit land throughout this period. 4.4 In 1993, the plaintiff attempted to redeem the mortgage by offering ₹1,20,000 to the defendant. However, the defendant refused to accept the payment, asserting that, according to the terms of the mortgage deed, the mortgage had transformed into an absolute sale due to the plaintiff’s failure to repay the amount within the stipulated time.
