[Paras 43, 44, 45, 46] [Per Surya Kant, J.] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Constitution of India – Art. 20(3) – Arrest – Grounds of arrest – Detention citing evasive reply: Held: The respondent-CBI is definitely wrong when it says that because the appellant was evasive in his reply, because he was not cooperating with the investigation, therefore, he was rightly arrested and now should be continued in detention – It cannot be the proposition that only when an accused answers the questions put to him by the investigation agency in the manner in which the investigating agency would like the accused to answer, would mean that the accused is cooperating with the investigation – Further, the respondent cannot justify arrest and continued detention citing evasive reply – One should not forget the cardinal principle under Article 20(3) of the Constitution that no person accused of an offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. [Paras 24, 25] [Per Ujjal Bhuyan, J.] Constitution of India – Art. 20(3) – No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself: Held: Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India states that no person accused of an offence shall be compelled to be a witness against 688 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports himself – This Court has held that such a protection is available to a person accused of an offence not merely with respect to the evidence that may be given in the court in the course of the trial, but is also available to the accused at a previous stage if an accusation has been made against him which might in the normal course result in his prosecution – Thus, the protection is available to a person against whom a formal accusation has been made, though the actual trial may not have commenced and if such an accusation relates to the commission of an offence which in the normal course may result in prosecution – An accused has the right to remain silent; he cannot be compelled to make inculpatory statements against himself – No adverse inference can be drawn from the silence of the accused – If this is the position, then the very grounds given for arrest of the appellant would be wholly untenable – On such grounds, it would be a travesty of justice to keep the appellant in further detention in the CBI case, more so, when he has already been granted bail on the same set of allegations under the more stringent provisions of PMLA. [Para 25] [Per Ujjal Bhuyan, J.] Bail – Bail jurisprudence: Held: Bail jurisprudence is a facet of a civilised criminal justice system – An accused is innocent until proven guilty by a competent court following the due process – Hence, there is presumption of innocence – Therefore, this Court has been reiterating again and again the salutary principle that bail is the rule and jail is the exception – As such, the courts at all levels must ensure that the process leading to and including the trial does not end up becoming the punishment itself – This Court has emphasized and re-emphasized time and again that personal liberty is sacrosanct – It is of utmost importance that trial courts and the High Courts remain adequately alert to the need to protect personal liberty which is a cherished right under Constitution.
