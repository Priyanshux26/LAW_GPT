“This Court has in numerous cases emphasized that while discussing constitutional requirements, court and counsel must never forget the core principle embodied in the international conventions and instruments and as far as possible, give effect to the principles contained in those international instruments. The courts are under an obligation to give due regard to international conventions and norms for construing domestic laws, more so, when there is no inconsistency between them and there is a void in domestic law.” 166. In M/s Entertainment Network (India) Ltd. v. M/s Super Cassette Industries Ltd.251 this Court expressed its willingness to adopt principle of international conventions to which India is not a signatory where they were compatible with Indian law. This approach was further exemplified in Ravindra Kumar Dhariwal v. Union of India252 246 See Prem Shankar Shukla v. Delhi Admn. (1980) 3 SCC 526; Mackinnon Mackenzie and Co. Ltd. v. Audrey D’ Costa (1987) 2 SCC 469; Sheela Barse v. Secy., Children’s Aid Society [(1987) 3 SCC 50, 51] SCC at p. 54; Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997) 6 SCC 241; People’s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India (1997) 3 SCC 433 and D.K. Basu v. State of W.B. (1997) 1 SCC 416, 438. 247 [1997] Supp. 3 SCR 404 : 1997 AIR 3011 248 These guidelines were informed by several international instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 111 on discrimination in employment. 249 1996 INSC 952; The Court incorporated principles like the “precautionary principle” and the “polluter pays principle” into domestic law. 250 [1999] 1 SCR 117 : (1999) 1 SCC 759 251 This position has been reiterated by various other decisions of this Court. See, for instance, National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India (2014) 5 SCC 438. 252 Ravinder Kumar Dhariwal v Union of India, 2021 INSC 916. 1600 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports where this Court maintained that even when India is not a signatory to certain international treaties, the principles enshrined within them could still inform the interpretation of domestic legislation. 167. The overarching theme emerging from these s is that India has a dual obligation: to respect its commitments under international treaties and to interpret domestic laws in a manner consistent with international human rights standards. This is particularly relevant concerning child marriage, as India has ratified several international instruments that set the minimum age for marriage at eighteen, including CEDAW253 and the CRC254. Moreover, even if India is not a party to certain regional conventions that address child marriage directly, the principles of non-discrimination, the best interests of the child, and the right to free and informed consent should guide national legislation and policy in this area. These fundamental principles are embedded in various international human rights instruments and form the backbone of child protection efforts globally. 168. As Prof. Rangita De Silva-De Alwis argues in her report, Child Marriage and the Law – Legislative Reform Initiative Paper Series255 child marriage must be treated as a human rights issue to highlight its seriousness and prompt state parties to amend their laws and policies accordingly.256 She also emphasises that framing child marriage within international treaties compels States to be accountable for their inaction on this issue.
