Respondent No. 1 was informed on 23.08.2021 about the rejection of bid of respondent No.1 and on 01.10.2021, the earnest money was also refunded. On 18.10.2021, the IDA passed a resolution for issuance of a fresh NIT with a reserve price of Rs. 26,000/- per square meter and thereafter, a fresh NIT was issued on 17.11.2021. Respondent No. 1 after issuance of the fresh NIT preferred a writ petition on 24.11.2021 before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, inter alia, challenging resolution dated 27.07.2021 rejecting the bid as well as being aggrieved by the issuance of fresh NIT dated 17.11.2021. 4. It is pertinent to note that respondent No.1 did not participate in the subsequent NIT issued on 17.11.2021. Respondent No. 1 before the High Court stated that by no stretch of imagination, his bid could have been cancelled as he was the highest bidder. It was further stated by respondent No.1 before the learned Single Judge that he is ready to negotiate in the matter and the bid has been cancelled without assigning any reason. 5. The IDA did file a detailed and exhaustive reply before the learned Single Judge and reliance was placed upon the terms and conditions of the NIT. Heavy reliance was placed upon Condition No. 6 which empowered the IDA to accept or reject any or all bids. Learned Single Judge after hearing the parties at length arrived at the conclusion that the petitioner Trust is not entitled to any relief as no contract was executed at any point of time nor any letter of allotment was issued in its favour. Learned Single Judge also held that the highest bidder does not acquire any vested right to have the auction concluded in his favour and the IDA was justified in issuing fresh NIT in the matter. 6. Respondent aggrieved by the s passed by the learned Single Judge preferred a writ appeal and the Division Bench of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore Bench allowed the writ appeal directing the IDA to allot the plot to respondent in case he is ready to pay the price of the land in question at Rs. 26,000/- per square meter. Para 6, 7 and 8 of the passed by the Division Bench of the High Court reads as under: [2024] 11 S.C.R. 929 Indore Vikas Praadhikaran (IDA) & Anr. v. Shri Humud Jain Samaj Trust & Anr. “6. The dates and events of the case are not in dispute. In the first NIT, the base price of the land was Rs.21,000/- per sq. meter as fixed by the Indore Development Authority. Out of three bidders, the petitioner offered the highest bid. Rs.25671.90/-. The property tax on land to the Municipal Corporation is payable by IDA. The resolution has been passed with the hope that the IDA might fetch higher prices than the price received in the first round of NIT. Unfortunately in the second round not, a single bidder had participated and the tender proceedings have resulted in an unsuccessful attempt.
