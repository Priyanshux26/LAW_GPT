In Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority v. Sharadkumar Jayantikumar Pasawalla45 this Court observed: “7. […] In our view, such power of imposition of tax and/or fee by delegated authority must be very specific and there is no scope for implied authority for imposition of such tax 43 M P V Sundararamier & Co. v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 1958 SCC OnLine SC 22 44 Kandivali Coop. Industrial Estate v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (2015) 11 SCC 161 [25] 45 [1992] 3 SCR 328 : (1992) 3 SCC 285 [7] 1516 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports or fee. It appears to us that the delegated authority must act strictly within the parameters of the authority delegated to it under the Act and it will not be proper to bring the theory of implied intent or the concept of incidental and ancillary power in the matter of exercise of fiscal power.” 34. The principles that flow from the above discussion are: (i) a fee is an impost in terms of Article 366(28); (ii) the expression “tax” occurring in Article 265 means all imposts, including fees and therefore any fee must be levied by the authority of a valid law; (iii) fees being a compulsory exaction of money, the power to levy fees cannot be implied; (iv) delegation of the power to levy fees to a delegate of the legislature should be specifically provided for under the parent legislation; and (v) the delegate must strictly act within the parameters of the legislative policy laid down by the parent legislation when levying fees and taxes. v.

Article 110 of the Constitution, though in a different context, recognizes that fees imposed under the authority of law may include (i) fees for licences; and (ii) fees for service.46 In Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt,47 a Constitution Bench explained the concept of licence fees thus: “47. […] In the first class of cases, the Government simply grants a permission or privilege to a person to do something, which otherwise that person would not be competent to do and extracts fees either heavy or moderate from that person in return for the privilege that is conferred. A most common illustration of this type of cases is furnished by the licence fees for motor vehicles. Here the costs incurred by the Government in maintaining an 46 Article 110(2), Constitution of India. [It reads: “110. Definition of “Money Bills”- […] (2) A Bill shall not be deemed to be a Money Bill by reason only that it provides for the imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment of fees for licences or fees for services rendered, or by reason that it provides for the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes.”] 47 [1954] 1 SCR 1005 : (1954) 1 SCC 412 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1517 Gaurav Kumar v.
