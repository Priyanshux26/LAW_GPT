It is submitted that therefore the following questions arise for consideration in the present case. (1) Whether the benefit of Section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1963 is available to a party when the “prescribed period” of 3 D months for filing a petition under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act has already expired and the discretionary period of 30 days under the proviso to Section 34(3) falls on a day when the Court is closed? (2) Whether the benefit of Section 10 of the General Clauses E Act,1897 is separately available to a party in such circumstances? 5.2 Now, so far as the applicability of Section 4 of the Limitation Act is concerned, it is vehemently submitted by Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Counsel that Section 4 of the Limitation Act shall not be applicable F to the 30 days’ discretionary condonable period contemplated under proviso to Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. It is submitted that Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act stipulates that an application under Section 34(1) of the Arbitration Act challenging an arbitral award may not be made after a period of three months from the date on which the party making the application had received the arbitral award. The proviso to G Section 34(3) gives limited powers to the Court, on sufficient cause being shown, to condone delay in filing the application under Section 34(1) only for a maximum period of 30 days, but not thereafter. It is submitted that in the case of Union of India v. Popular Construction Co. reported in (2001) 8 SCC 470 (Paras 10, 12, 14 and 16), this Court H 372 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A has observed that usage of words “but not thereafter” in the proviso to Section 34(3) amounts to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act. Therefore, the Court would have no discretion to condone the delay in excess of 30 days. Section 5 of the Limitation Act was, therefore, held to be inapplicable to Section 34(1) of the Arbitration Act. B 5.3 It is submitted that Section 4 of the Limitation Act is only applicable when the last date of the “prescribed period” falls on a day on which the Court is closed. It is submitted that the term, “prescribed period” is defined in Section 2(j) of the Limitation Act as being the period of limitation computed in accordance with the provisions of the Limitation C Act. 5.4 It is submitted that this Court in the case of Assam Urban (Supra) (Paras 10 to 14) has held that “prescribed period” under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act is three months. It is submitted that “further period” of 30 days mentioned in the proviso to Section 34(3) of the D Arbitration Act cannot be said to be the “period of limitation” and therefore, would not be the “prescribed period” for the purposes of making an application for setting aside the arbitral award. It is submitted that thus, in the said decision, this Court has categorically held that Section 4 of the Limitation Act which applies only to “prescribed period” is not E attracted when the last date of the “further period” of 30 days mentioned in Section 34(3) of the Limitation Act falls on a day on which the Court is closed.
