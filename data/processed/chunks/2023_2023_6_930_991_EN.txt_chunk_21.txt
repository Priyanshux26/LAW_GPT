Section 49 of the U.P. Consolidation D of Holding Act, 1953 bars the same issue being considered by the Tribunal which had the trappings of the Civil Court. The two sales were void ab initio under Section 51(1) and Section 51(A) of the Act. Again, support is drawn from the in Thakur Mohd. Ismail (supra) as also Ahmed G.H. Ariff and others v. Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Calcutta16. A beneficiary/Mutawalli had no right to transfer the waqf E property. Article 65 of the Limitation Act did not apply to the proceedings of the Act in view of Section 107 of the Limitation Act. It is further contended that Article 65 applied to suits. It did not apply to proceedings. Therefore, Section 27 of the Limitation Act, 1963 did not apply to the waqf property which stood vested in Almighty. Reliance is placed on F of this Court in Chhedi Lal Misra (Dead) Through Lrs. v. Civil Judge, Lucknow and others17. Paragraph-34A of the Waqf Deed, which contemplates spending of Rs.500/- on charitable purposes and paragraph-34E, which contemplates that in case all the descendants of the Waqif die, then, the waqf shall be used for charitable purposes, brought the waqf under the definition of ‘waqf’. A void document, as is the case G with the sale deed and the compromise, would be ignored without the 15 AIR 1962 SC 1722 16 AIR 1971 SC 1691 17(2007) 4 SCC 632 H 958 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A need to set aside the same. The respondent no.1 in both the Appeals could not be said to have perfected their title by adverse possession against the State for which the period is 30 years. The litigation started in 1997, i.e., 23 years from the date of the collusive compromise and the void sale deed. This argument is based on the fact that the waqf property is managed on behalf of God by the Waqf Board which comes under the B superintendence of the Government under the law. ANALYSIS 15. Going by the contentions raised and, in the facts, the following points are noted: C 1. Whether there was a valid Shia Waqf and whether it was registered? 2. Whether the compromise dated 13.02.1974 and the dated 12.09.1974. are valid or are they void? 3. Whether the two sales, one on 14.10.1960 and the second on D 26.09.1974, in favour of the first respondent in the two Appeals before us, are void? 4. Whether the action is barred by limitation? 5. Whether the High Court was correct in finding that the action E was barred as it is not Article 96 of the Limitation Act, which applied but Article 65? What is the interplay between the said Articles in the facts? 6. What is the impact of Section 27 of the Limitation Act, 1963 in the facts? F 7. Whether Section 107 of the Act removes the bar of limitation at any rate? 16. The High Court in the impugned has confirmed the findings of the Tribunal that Respondent No.1 in both the cases have acquired title by adverse possession.
