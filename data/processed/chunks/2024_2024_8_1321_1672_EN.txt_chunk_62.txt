178 Milind (supra) [12]. 179 Milind (supra) [15]. 1404 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports After due inquiry, the community may be added to the List by Parliament, subject to its satisfaction that such a modification is required. Until then, the State has to apply the Scheduled Castes List as it is.180 Thus, to summarize, Article 341(2) bars the State Legislature from removing or adding castes from and to the List respectively. Sub-classification within the Scheduled Castes for the purposes of affirmative action, including reservation does not include or exclude any caste or group from the List. Section D(iii) of this deals with the different models of sub-classification to determine if the operation of reservation upon sub- classification in-effect leads to exclusion. v. Historical and empirical evidence of inter-se backwardness within the Scheduled Castes 124. Having held that Article 341 does not create an integrated homogenous class, we will next decide whether there is an intelligible differentia to group the castes within the Scheduled Castes. For this, it needs to be analyzed if the Scheduled Castes are a heterogenous class. The respondents submitted that there cannot be any sub- categorization of the Scheduled Castes because all the castes face the same form of social backwardness based on untouchability. The petitioners, on the other hand, submitted that there exists inter-se backwardness within the Scheduled Castes. 125. The Constitution of India does not provide a definition of the Scheduled Castes. Article 366(24) states that castes/groups notified under Article 341 shall be Scheduled Castes. However, neither Article 341 nor Article 366(24) prescribes the criteria for their identification. The President issued the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) 1950 which nearly corresponds to the Government of India (Scheduled Castes) 1936 notified under the Government of India Act 1935.181 It is important to identify the criteria for inclusion of groups or castes in the Scheduled Castes 1936. 126. The Government of India Act 1935 did not define the criteria for the identification of Scheduled Castes. Clause 26(1) of the First Schedule 180 Palghat Jilla Thandan Samudhaya Samrakshna Samithi v. State of Kerala (1994) 1 SCC 359 [17, 18] 181 Marc Galanter, Competing Equalities: Law and the Backward Classes in India, [Oxford University Press (1984)] 130 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1405 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. to it defined the Scheduled Castes as castes that corresponded to the classes of persons known as the “depressed classes”: “the scheduled castes” means such castes, races or tribes, or parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes being castes, races, tribes, parts or groups which appear to his Majesty in Council to correspond to the classes of persons formerly known as the depressed classes, as His Majesty in Council may specify.” (emphasis supplied) 127. It is necessary that we briefly refer to the historical material on how the depressed classes were identified to analyze if the Scheduled Castes are a heterogenous class and whether there is an intelligible differentia distinguishing the sub-categories within the Scheduled Castes.
