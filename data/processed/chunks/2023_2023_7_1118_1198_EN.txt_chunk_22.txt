For both the Meetings, the Bye-Laws G does not contemplate written notice to be issued. The notice mentioned in Rule 19(vii) is that of the meeting and not a notice to each member. It is clear that the notice can be by way of publication, affixing at notice board, announcement, etc. In the case on hand, notice of Special General Council Meeting was by H 1148 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A announcement in the 23.06.2022meeting. Therefore, the notice given by announcement on 23.06.2022 was a due notice for convening the Special General Council Meeting on 11.07.2022. When the notice for General Council Meeting on 12.09.2017 was issued by the Headquarters office Bearers on 28.08.2017, the announcement made at the floor of the General Council Meeting B on 23.06.2022 for convening Special General Council Meeting on 11.07.2022 can be construed as a proper notice. The word “notice”, denotes merely an intimation to the party concerned of a particular fact. It cannot be limited to “notice in writing” and only to a letter. A notice may take several forms. Even assuming C that the notice suffers from procedural irregularity, it is always open to the members of the General Council to ratify, as long as there is a substantive right/function underlying in the notice. This ratio has been laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the reported in AIR 1962 SC 666 (cited supra). D 29. Had the Framers of the Bye-Laws thought of giving 15 days notice even for the convening of the Special General Council Meeting at the request of 1/5th of the General Council members, they would have incorporated giving 15 days notice at the end of the second part of Rule 19(vii). The mentioning of giving 15 days notice in the first part would establish the intention of the framers E of the Bye-Laws was to give notice to the members of the General Council only in respect of the regular Annual General Council Meeting and for the General Council Meeting convened at the instance of the Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator. Since the Special General Council Meeting are being convened at the F request of the members of the General Council, there will not be any necessity for giving another notice to the members again for convening the Special General Council Meeting. If 15 days notice is again given even for convening Special General Council Meeting at the request of 1/5th of the members of the General Council, it leads to a situation where the meeting can be convened only G between 16th and 30th day. 30. Admittedly, the Agenda for the meeting was issued on 01.07.2022. On 23.06.2022 itself a decision has been taken to convene a meeting on 11.07.2022. The requisition for convening a Special General Council Meeting signed by 2190 General Council H THIRU K. PALANISWAMY v. M. SHANMUGAM & ORS. 1149 [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] members was addressed to the Presidium Chairman, Co-Ordinator A and Joint Co-Ordinator and the same was given to the Presidium Chairman.
