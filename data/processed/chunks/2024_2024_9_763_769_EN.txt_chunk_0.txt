[2024] 9 S.C.R. 763 : 2024 INSC 743 R.P. Garg v. The Chief General Manager, Telecom Department & Ors. (Civil Appeal No. 10472 of 2024) 10 September 2024 [Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha* and Sandeep Mehta, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the appellant is entitled to post-award interest on the sum awarded by the Arbitrator. Headnotes† Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.31(7)(b) – Grant of post-award interest, not subject to the contract between the parties – Appellant claimed payment of post-award interest, denied on the ground that the contract between the parties did not permit it – Correctness: Held: Not correct – By virtue of s.31(7)(b), a sum directed to be paid by an Arbitral Award shall carry interest – s.31(7)(b) deals with grant of interest for post award period i.e., from the date of the award till its realization – The statutory scheme relating to grant of interest provided in s.31(7) creates a distinction between post-award and pre-award interest – s.31(7)(a) regulates pre-award interest and provides that the grant of interest shall be subject to the agreement between the parties as is evident from the expression at the commencement of the sub-section “unless otherwise agreed by the parties” – Whereas, so far as the entitlement of the post-award interest is concerned, s.31(7)(b) provides that the sum directed to be paid by the Arbitral Tribunal shall carry interest – The rate of interest can be provided by the Arbitrator and in default the statutory prescription will apply – Thus, s.31(7)(b) is not subject to party autonomy and is in contrast with s.31(7)(a) as it does not give the parties the right to “contract out” interest for the post-award period – Further, the expression ‘unless the award otherwise directs’ in s.31(7)(b) relates to rate of interest and not entitlement of interest – The only distinction made by s.31(7)(b) is that the rate of interest granted under the Award is to be given precedence over the statutorily prescribed rate – Impugned of the High Court set aside – of the First * Author 764 [2024] 9 S.C.R.
