(2010) 12 SCC 186. 9.16.2 The Bombay High Court, however, held that the aforesaid decisions are not applicable to the present case and proceeded to examine the plea of the Assessee that since the antenna is fitted onto the tower and shelter is used for providing telecommunication services, they would qualify as “inputs” under Rule 2(k) of the CENVAT Credit Rules. In support of this contention, the Assessee had placed reliance on the following decisions:- (i) Industrial Machinery Manufacturers (P) Ltd. v. State of Gujarat, 1963 SCC Online Guj 84 : (1965) 16 STC 380 (Guj). (ii) Board of Revenue v. Phelps & Co. (P) Ltd. (1972) 4 SCC 121. (iii) J.K. Cotton Spg. & Wvg. Mills Co. Ltd. v.

Assistant Collector of Central Excise, 1993 SCC OnLine Cal 441 The Bombay High Court, however, did not find the aforesaid decisions applicable to the present case. 9.16.3 The Bombay High Court then proceeded to examine the alternate plea of the Assessee that the tower is an accessory of antenna and without towers, antenna cannot be installed and hence it cannot function, and therefore, tower should be treated as a part or component or accessory of the antenna. The contention of the Assessee was that the antenna falls under Chapter 85 of the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act and is thus “capital good” within the meaning of Rule 2(a)(A)(i) and (ii), therefore, tower being an accessory of antenna, will be eligible for availing CENVAT credit under Rule 2(a)(A)(iii). Some more cases relied upon by the Assessee were as follows. (i) M/s. Annapurna Carbon Industries Co. v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1976) 2 SCC 273. (ii) Commissioner of Sales Tax, Maharashtra State, Bombay v. L.D. Bhave & Sons, 1981 SCC OnLine Bom 438. (iii) Mehra Brothers v. Joint Commercial Officer (1991) 1 SCC 514. The Bombay High Court on examination held these decisions not to be applicable to the present case. 9.17 The Bombay High Court then considered the contentions advanced on behalf of the Revenue which were as follows :- i) Since towers and parts thereof are fixed to the earth, thus, after being installed become immovable property and hence, cannot be considered as “goods” and consequently cannot be “capital goods”. ii) The tower in CKD/SKD condition would be classifiable under Chapter Heading 7308 of the Central Excise Tariff [2024] 11 S.C.R.
