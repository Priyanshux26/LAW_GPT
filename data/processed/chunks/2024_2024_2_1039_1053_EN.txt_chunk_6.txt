In the meantime, Gurpreet Singh, armed with a pistol, and Jagdeep Singh, wielding a hockey stick, entered the premises by scaling the boundary wall. Gurpreet Singh aimed the pistol at Amarjit Kaur, who was standing on the stairs, firing a shot that struck below her right ear. Subsequently, Gurpreet Singh and Jagdeep Singh fled in an Innova car. P.W.3 also detailed the motive, indicating that Gurpreet Singh believed Amarjit Kaur was responsible for the divorce from Kirandeep Kaur, sabotaging his plan to settle in Australia. 23. P.W.9, Hari Mittar, the Investigating Officer of the case, reported that upon reaching the scene of the incident, he documented the statement 1048 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of P.W.2 and compiled an inquest report concerning the deceased, Amarjit Kaur. Additionally, he mentioned that after the arrest, Gurpreet Singh was interrogated where he made a disclosure statement (Ex. PW9/F) revealing the concealment of a 12-bore country-made pistol along with two live cartridges in bushes opposite Gurudwara Bhaura Sahib. Acting on this disclosure statement, the police successfully recovered a 12-bore country-made pistol, one empty cartridge, and two live cartridges of the same calibre. 24. The Trial Court, deeming P.W.2 and P.W.3 as natural witnesses, based its findings on their testimonies to establish the involvement of Gurpreet Singh in the murder of Amarjit Kaur. Furthermore, the Trial Court noted that there was no apparent motive for P.W.2 and P.W.3 to protect the real culprits and falsely accuse innocent individuals in connection with the crime. The pertinent paragraph is outlined below: “51. Thus, the presence of both the complainant and Harmandeep Kaur at the place of occurrence comes across as natural presence. From the direct and unequivocal testimonies of both theses witnesses the fact that accused Gurpreet Singh shot at Amarjit Kaur is duly established. The complainant and the eye witness lost their family member in the incident. There would be no reason for the complainant and Harmandeep Kaur to shield the actual culprits and to name the innocent as the perpetrators of the crime.” 25. The High Court, however, in the impugned , stated that the defence has been able to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s story. Consequently, High Court has disbelieved the testimonies of P.W.2 and P.W.3. 26. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the reasons assigned by the High Court, and we find it extremely difficult to concur with the same. We say so for the reason that the presence of Gursewak Singh (P.W.2) in his own house cannot indeed be doubted for the simple reason that the occurrence took place at 1.30 p.m. and he made a call to the Police Control Room at 1.40 p.m. The fact that in the very first version, Gursewak Singh disclosed the name of the Gurpreet Singh, as being the killer of his wife, leaves no room to doubt that he was physically present in the house and witnessed the occurrence.
