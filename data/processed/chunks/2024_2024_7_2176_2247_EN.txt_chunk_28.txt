Sebastian (2009) 14 SCC 360]. 37. This Court in K.K. Saksena v. International Commission on Irrigation & Drainage (2015) 4 SCC 670, 2216 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports after an exhaustive review of its earlier decisions on the subject, held as follows:- (SCC pp. 692 & 696, paras 43 & 52) “43. What follows from a minute and careful reading of the aforesaid s of this Court is that if a person or authority is “State” within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, admittedly a writ petition under Article 226 would lie against such a person or body. However, we may add that even in such cases writ would not lie to enforce private law rights. There are a catena of s on this aspect and it is not necessary to refer to those s as that is the basic principle of judicial review of an action under the administrative law. The reason is obvious. A private law is that part of a legal system which is a part of common law that involves relationships between individuals, such as law of contract or torts. Therefore, even if writ petition would be maintainable against an authority, which is “State” under Article 12 of the Constitution, before issuing any writ, particularly writ of mandamus, the Court has to satisfy that action of such an authority, which is challenged, is in the domain of public law as distinguished from private law. x x x x 52. It is trite that contract of personal service cannot be enforced. There are three exceptions to this rule, namely: (i) when the employee is a public servant working under the Union of India or State; (ii) when such an employee is employed by an authority/body which is a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India; and [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2217 Army Welfare Education Society New Delhi v. Sunil Kumar Sharma & Ors. Etc. (iii) when such an employee is “workmen” within the meaning of Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and raises a dispute regarding his termination by invoking the machinery under the said Act. In the first two cases, the employment ceases to have private law character and “status” to such an employment is attached. In the third category of cases, it is the Industrial Disputes Act which confers jurisdiction on the Labour Court/Industrial Tribunal to grant reinstatement in case termination is found to be illegal.” 38. The following decisions have been adverted to in K.K. Saksena (supra):- 1. Andi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust v. V.R. Rudani (1989) 2 SCC 691 2. G. Bassi Reddy v. International Crops Research Institute (2003) 4 SCC 225, 3. Praga Tools Corpn. v. C.A. Imanual (1969) 1 SCC 585, 4. Federal Bank Ltd. v. Sagar Thomas (2003) 10 SCC 733. 39. This Court in Janet Jeyapaul v. SRM University (2015) 16 SCC 530, held that when a private body exercises its public functions even if it is not a State, the aggrieved person has a remedy, not only under the ordinary law, but also by way of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution.
