100 Crore and Property No.3 valued at Rs. 50 Crore. The table provides that the date of creation of such security would be the Effective Date. This security had to be created at the cost of the SRA. Therefore, the SRA was obliged to [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2089 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. not only infuse an amount of Rs. 350 Crore within 180 days of the Effective Date, but also execute the mortgage of the three Dubai properties on the Effective Date. In other words, the Resolution Plan obligated the SRA to satisfy the following twin conditions for the PBG to be discharged – (a) infusing Rs. 350 Crore as the first tranche payment and (b) executing a mortgage on the three Dubai properties worth Rs. 250 Crore on the Effective Date. The learned ASG submitted that, it is not in dispute that the NCLT vide its dated 11.04.2022 extended the time for achieving the Effective Date to 25.05.2022 and Respondent No.1 claimed to have achieved the same on 20.05.2022. Consequently, all the three Dubai properties ought to have been mortgaged on or before 20.05.2022. 33. It was submitted that the Respondent SRA failed to make the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore despite the fact that it ought to have been infused within 6 months from 20.05.2022. Instead, the Respondent SRA continuously contended that the of the NCLT dated 13.01.2023 (holding that the Conditions Precedent have been fulfilled) was challenged by the Appellants before the NCLAT and that they could not therefore bring in Rs. 350 Crore since the Effective Date had not yet materialized. 34. It was submitted that the Appellants filed the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 before the NCLAT and vide Para 8 of the Lender’s Affidavit, the Appellants agreed not to contest the issues relating to the grant of exclusion of time (granted by the of the NCLT dated 13.01.2023 and the NCLAT dated 26.05.2023) and the issue relating to the compliance with the Conditions Precedent. In the said affidavit, the Appellants also agreed to withdraw the Company Appeal pending before the NCLAT along with the Civil Appeal Nos. 4131-4134 of 2023 and Civil Appeal Nos. 3736-3737/2023 filed before this Court. However, this would be subject to the fulfilment of the three conditions imposed vide Para 8 by the SRA. The conditions were that – firstly, the SRA infuses an amount of Rs. 350 Crore by 31.08.2023 i.e., the date by which the said payment is to be made as per the Resolution Plan read with dated 26.05.2023 passed by the NCLAT; secondly, the SRA undertakes to scrupulously follow the other terms and conditions of the Resolution Plan and; thirdly, the SRA complies with the liabilities in relation to the payment to be made to the employees as per the of NCLAT dated 21.10.2022, which has been upheld by this Court vide dated 30.01.2023 2090 [2024] 11 S.C.R.
