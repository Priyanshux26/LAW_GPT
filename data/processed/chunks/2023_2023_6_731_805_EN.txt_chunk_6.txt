Nothing in either Article 323-A of the Constitution or the F Administrative Tribunals Act prevents such a revival. Further, the absence of a provision in the Constitution which explicitly permits a revival does not act as a barrier to such a revival. The Union Government’s reliance on Section 21 of the General Clauses Act is in accordance with law. [Para 71, 72][781-F-H; 782-A-B] G Lt. Governor of H.P. Avinash Sharma (1970) 2 SCC 149 : [1971] 1 SCR 413 – distinguished. A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak (1988) 2 SCC 602 : [1988] 1 Suppl. SCR 1 – held inapplicable.

The notification dated 2 August 2019 is not violative of Article 14 of the Constitution C 6.1 While arriving at the decision to abolish the OAT, the State Government considered relevant reasons. It considered whether the OAT was capable of fulfilling the purpose for which it was established after the decision in L. Chandra Kumar. It placed in the balance the expenditure incurred to operate the D OAT as well as the rate of disposal of cases. These reasons were not irrelevant to the decision as to whether a tribunal ought to be continued; 6.2 The State Government’s act of consulting the Orissa High Court (upon receiving a request to this effect from the Union E Government) before deciding to abolish the OAT was not irrelevant or extraneous. The cases before the OAT were to be transferred to the Orissa High Court and the opinion of the latter was relevant to State Government’s decision. 6.3 The State Government did not consider factors which F were irrelevant or extraneous to its decision. The decision to abolish the OAT was not one which was so absurd that no reasonable person or authority would ever have taken it. The decision to abolish a tribunal which it had established, based on an analysis of relevant factors is, by no stretch of imagination, an absurd or unreasonable decision. It does not violate Article 14 of G the Constitution. [Para 82][788-A-E] 6.4 The decision to establish, continue or abolish the OAT is in the nature of a policy formulated and implemented by the State Government (acting with the Union Government under the H ORISSA ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL BAR ASSOCIATION v. 741 UNION OF INDIA Administrative Tribunals Act). The public at large does not have A a right to be heard before a policy is formulated and implemented. The process of consultation with the public, with experts, and with other stakeholders may be desirable and would facilitate a participatory democracy.
