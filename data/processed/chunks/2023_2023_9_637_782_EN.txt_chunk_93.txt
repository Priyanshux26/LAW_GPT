In the affidavit filed before the High Court, the appellant conceded that unamended Regulation 4.1.11 was applicable to the respondent, who is the auction- purchaser. The facts of the present clearly demonstrate that on 24 January 2007, when the auction-purchaser applied for electricity, unamended D Clause 4.1.11 was operational and applicable. Therefore, the respondent cannot be made liable to clear the dues of the previous owner in the absence of any express statutory condition in that regard. The impugned of the High Court is upheld. The appeal shall stand dismissed. Item 101.7: Dakshin Gujarat Vij Co. Ltd v. Amardeep E Association; SLP (C) No. 73 of 2015 275.
