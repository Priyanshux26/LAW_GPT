Once such an Application is filed, it was the duty of the Court to pass an . The Court according to the appellants H ARTI DIXIT & ANR v. SUSHIL KUMAR MISHRA & ORS 749 [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] had a duty to indicate as to whether the Application for permission to A give security was allowed and in what form the security should be furnished. It was as no s were passed, that the appellants on their own filed Application and purported to furnish the security in the form of the rented shop. The High Court in its dated 03.12.2015, accepted the submission of the Counsel for the parties that the surety was accepted B by the Court on 25.04.2015 and the matter was directed to be decided expeditiously and on the said basis, the Trial Court had allowed the Application under IX Rule 13.This was set aside by the ADJ by dated 01.08.2017 on the basis that the dated 24.05.2014 did not mean that the security was accepted. The trial court was to consider the application dated 06.05.2014 on its own merits. This C was so ed after finding that no had been passed on the application dated 12.05.2014 accepting the security. It must be noticed that the appellants did not challenge the dated 01.08.2017. Pursuant to the dated 01.08.2017, the Trial Court, by dated 11.02.2019, did not find merit in the case of the appellants and dismissed the D Application filed under Section 17 dated 06.05.2014 as also the Application dated 12.05.2014 and rejected the surety. It is this , which has been upheld again by the ADJ by dated 26.02.2021 and then by the High Court, by the impugned . 21. On a literal interpretation of Section 17 of the Act, which E contemplates the Application under Section 17 being filed before the Application under IX Rule 13, whether appellants have made out a case. The first question, which we would have to consider is, whether the Application is in conformity with the proviso to Section 17. Did the applicant furnish any security on 06.05.2014? The answer can only be in the negative.The appellant did not seek for dispensing with deposit as F such. [See paragraph-9 of Kedarnath (supra)].Therefore, the appellant had not in the said sense complied with the mandatory requirement of Section 17. Next, was the prayer, viz., the request to permit the appellant to deposit/furnish security for a sum of Rs.50,000/- due under the Decree in consonance with Section 17? What was the duty of the Court in the G face of such prayer under Section 17? Was the furnishing of the security consisting of the rented shop belonging to the Local Body, sufficient compliance of Section 17? What is the effect of the application dated 12.05.2014 and the dated 25.05.2014 on the same which is obviously after 06.05.2014 (the date of the application under IX Rule 13). H 750 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 22. The High Court in the impugned finds that no application for dispensing with surety was filed and that this will be read against the appellants.
