[2024] 8 S.C.R. 633 : 2024 INSC 604 Jalaluddin Khan v. Union of India (Criminal Appeal No. 3173 of 2024) 13 August 2024 [Abhay S. Oka* and Augustine George Masih, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Factors to be taken into consideration, under Section 43D(5) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, while deciding Bail Applications for offences falling under Chapters IV and VI of the Act. Headnotes† Bail is the Rule and jail is an exception – Principle – Statutes with Stringent condition – Applicability of: Held: The Court while deciding an application of bail falling under the provisions of Section 43D (5) is not required to conduct a mini- trial – Only a prima facie case has to be established – The Court has to examine the material forming a part of the charge sheet to decide whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusations against the person applying for bail are prima facie true – While doing so, the court must take the charge sheet as it is – When a case is made out for a grant of bail, the Courts should not have any hesitation in granting bail – The allegations of the prosecution may be very serious – But, the duty of the Courts is to consider the case for grant of bail in accordance with the law – “Bail is the rule and jail is an exception” is a settled law – Even in cases of statutes where there are stringent conditions for the grant of bail, the same rule holds good with only a modification that the bail can be granted if the conditions in the statute are satisfied – The rule also means that once a case is made out for the grant of bail, the Court cannot decline to grant bail – If the Courts start denying bail in deserving cases, it will be a violation of the rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
