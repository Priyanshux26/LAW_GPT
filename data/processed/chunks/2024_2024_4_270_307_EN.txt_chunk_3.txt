This led to invoking offences under Sections 13, 16, 17, 18, 18B, 20, 38, 39 and 40 of the 1967 Act. On 06.06.2018, appellant’s residence was raided and certain literatures, electronic devices and mobile phones were seized from her. On that date itself, the appellant came to be arrested by the State Police. 4. On 02.11.2018, statement of one Kumarasai was recorded. He had also recorded two other subsequent statements on 23.12.2018 (Annexure P-6 to the appeal-petition) and 24.08.2020. All these statements form a part of the three chargesheets which have been submitted in connection with the subject case and we shall refer to the contents thereof later in this . We would also point out here that on behalf of prosecution, four sets of statements have been produced before us as statements of protected witnesses. But status of two of those witnesses as ‘protected’ was removed by the Special Court constituted under the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 (“2008 Act”) by an passed on 27.04.2022. The investigation was transferred to the National Investigation Agency (“NIA”) on 24.01.2020 and the same case was renumbered as RC-01/2020/ NIA/MUM, with NIA police station, Mumbai. The Special Court held that prior directions to maintain secrecy in respect of identity of KW2 and KW4 ought to be set aside. The names of KW2 and KW4 thus stood removed from the list of protected witnesses. This was done mainly on the ground that copies of statements of those two witnesses had been supplied to the defence under Section 207 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“1973 Code”), which transmitted their names and identities. KW4 is Kumarasai, whose statement we have referred to earlier in this paragraph. [2024] 4 S.C.R. 275 Shoma Kanti Sen v. The State of Maharashtra & Anr. 5. On 15.11.2018, the initial chargesheet was submitted by the State Police invoking allegations of commission of offences under Sections 153A, 501(1)(b), 117, 120B, 121, 121A, 124A & 34 of the 1860 Code read with Sections 13, 16, 17, 18, 18B, 20, 38, 39 & 40 of the 1967 Act. The appellant was implicated in the said chargesheet as accused no. 4 for having committed offences under the aforesaid provisions. In column 10 of this chargesheet, under the heading “Details of accused charge-sheeted (with absconding accused)” names of Sudhir Prahlad Dhavle, Rona Jacob Wilson, Surendra Pundlikrao Gadling, Shoma Sen (the appellant) and Mahesh Sitaram Raut appear as arrested accused whereas names of five other accused persons have been shown as “at present underground”. A supplementary chargesheet was also filed by the State Police on 21.02.2019, broadly under the same provisions, implicating certain other individuals, Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonzalves, Arun Ferreira and Sudha Bhardwaj as accused persons in the same case. 6. After filing of the initial chargesheet, the appellant had preferred a bail application before the Sessions Court at Pune on 13.12.2018. The Additional Sessions Judge, upon going through the two chargesheets dated 15.11.2018 and 21.11.2019, rejected her bail plea by an dated 06.11.2019.
