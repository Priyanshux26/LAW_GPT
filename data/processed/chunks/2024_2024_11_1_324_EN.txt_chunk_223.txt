The purpose of expanding bank credit to priority areas which have hitherto been somewhat neglected- such as (1) the removal of control by a few, (2) provision of adequate credit for agriculture, small industry and exports, (3) the giving of a professional bent to bank management, (4) the encouragement of new classed of entrepreneurs, (5) the provision of adequate training as well as reasonable terms of service for bank staff- still remains and will call for continuous efforts over a long time. Nationalisation is necessary for the speedy achievement of these objectives”.72 This ordinance soon turned into an Act called the Banking Companies (Acquisition & Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1969 (Act 22 of 1969), passed in August 1969. This first phase of Bank Nationalisation resulted in the famous RC Cooper v. Union of India (1970) 1 SCC 248 where the majority of 10:1 struck down the Act on the grounds that “Act violates the guarantee of compensation under Article 31(2)”. It was not the case that RC Cooper held that the 72 a. MOin zaidi, the Great uPheaval 1969-1972 (Orientalia, 1972), Pgs. 103-105. 314 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports State was incompetent to nationalise the banks but it held that the Act nationalising the Banks did not apply the right principles in determining the compensation. RC Cooper discussed Bela Banerjee and Vajravelu in the following words: “89. This Court held in Bela Banerjee case that by the guarantee of the right to compensation for compulsory acquisition under Article 31(2), before it was amended by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, the owner was entitled to receive a “just equivalent” or “full indemnification”. In P. Vajravel Mudaliar case this Court held that notwithstanding the amendment of Article 31(2) by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, and even after the addition of the words “and no such law shall be called in question in any Court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not adequate”, the expression “compensation” occurring in Article 31(2) after the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act continued to have the same meaning as it had in Section 299(2) of the Government of India Act, 1935, and Article 31(2) before it was amended viz “just equivalent” or “full indemnification”. 90. There was apparently no dispute that Article 31(2) before and after it was amended guaranteed a right to compensation for compulsory acquisition of property and that by giving to the owner, for compulsory acquisition of his property, compensation which was illusory, or determined by the application of principles which were irrelevant, the constitutional guarantee of compensation was not complied with……….” 73 41. The main reason for holding the Bank Nationalising Act as unconstitutional in RC Cooper was that the principles specified in Schedule II of the Act, for determining compensation, were not appropriate. Many important factors like the goodwill of the bank and the value of unexpired periods of long-term leases were not taken 73 (1970) 1 SCC 248, paras 89 -90.
