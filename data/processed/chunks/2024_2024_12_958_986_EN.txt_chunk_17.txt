50. It was also opined by Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3) that in all cases of mental retardation there is an increased risk of developing convulsions. The Doctor, however, in her testimony before the learned Tribunal had stated that at that time, the appellant was not suffering from the same yet. The possibility of the same, however, cannot be ruled out. 51. Faced with such a situation, the family of the appellant must be financially equipped to deal with the medical conditions, current and potential. It would, therefore, be appropriate to enhance the compensation to be awarded under this head to Rs.5,00,000/-. 52. For ease of understanding and compliance, the revised compensation awarded to the appellant is as follows: S. No. Head Amount (In ₹) 1. Medicines and Medical Treatment 32,000/- 2. Loss of Earning Capacity due to 13,18,000/- Disability 3. Pain and Suffering 15,00,000/- [2024] 12 S.C.R. 985 Baby Sakshi Greola v. Manzoor Ahmad Simon and Another 4. Future Treatment 5,00,000/- 5. Attendant Charges 9,42,000/- 6. Loss of Amenities of Life 1,00,000/- 7. Loss of Future Prospect 1,00,000/- 8. Special Education Expenditure 75,000/- 9. Conveyance and Special Diet 20,000/- 10. Loss of Marriage Prospects 5,00,000/- Total 50,87,000/- 53. The High Court, vide impugned and , has enhanced the rate of interest awarded by the trial court to 9% per annum from the date of the filing of the claim petition till the actual realisation. We do not find any error with the same and maintain the rate of interest. 54. We direct the Insurance Company (Respondent No. 2) to disburse the compensation awarded to the appellant as above. Obviously, the Insurance Company shall be entitled to adjust the amount already paid, if any. 55. Needless to state, as the learned Tribunal has held the driver-cum- owner (Respondent No.1) and the insurance company (Respondent No.2) to be jointly and severally liable to make the payment of compensation to the appellant, the inter-se liability of the two respondents herein shall be decided in accordance with law. However, the Insurance Company is directed to make good the compensation awarded to the appellant as per this so that the appellant and her family members are not put to any further agony. 56. Lastly, we find it appropriate to refer to the of this Court in the case of General Manager, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, Trivandrum v. Susamma Thomas (Mrs.) and Others5, wherein it has been reiterated that the claims tribunal should, in the case of minors, invariably the amount of compensation awarded to the minor be invested in long term Fixed Deposits at least till the date of the minor attaining majority. However, the expenses incurred by guardian or next friend may be allowed to be withdrawn. 5 (1994) 2 SCC 176 986 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 57. We are cognizant of the fact that the appellant has attained majority, however, since the appellant was a minor at the time of the accident, we direct that at present an amount of Rs.10,00,000/- should be disbursed to the father of the appellant as her guardian.
