176. This prong of the test is also echoed in Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India,130 in which an 11-judge Bench of this Court held that the object of the statute was to foment economic development through the assistance of banks, and from a resource standpoint, this development could be more effectively facilitated by 14 banks in particular. Consequently, the Court ruled that classifying these 14 banks in a separate class was based on reasoning that had a nexus with the object of the statute. 177. To sum up, a classification is reasonable if it differentiates between similar and dissimilar elements, if such distinction is intelligible, and if the similarities and dissimilarities have nexus with the purpose of the statute.131 178. Further, within this twin-test framework of checking the form and object of classification, this Court has held that the effect of the statute must also be considered.132 Instead of a mere formalistic study of checking 129 Id; Roop Chand Adlakha v. DDA, supra note 126, para 16. 130 Rustom Cavasjee Cooper (Banks Nationalisation), supra note 56, paras 178-180. 131 Provisions similar to Article 14 exist in Singapore (Article 12) and Malaysia (Art. 8(1)), which also use this twin test framework; Po Yen Jap, Constitutional Dialogue in Common Law Asia, Oxford University Press,2015; Similar provisions also exist in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 7), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 26), and Constitutions of other countries such as Bhutan (Article 7(15)), Brazil (Article 5), Canada (Article 15), China (Article 33), France (Article 1), Germany (Article 3), Italy (Article 3), Japan (Article 14), Nepal (Article 18), Switzerland (Article 8), and the USA (Article 1). 132 Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India, supra note 71, para 409; State of T.N. v. National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Association (2021) 15 SCC 534, para 21. 1080 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the intelligible differentia and nexus with the object, this Court would undertake a normative analysis and strike down a classification if the object itself is discriminatory or leads to a prejudicial outcome not conducive to constitutional morality.133 This effectively prevents the test of reasonable classification from becoming a mere formula and, instead, ensures that constitutional values are protected when the object itself is unjust. Qualifications regarding the yardsticks 179. Having established the yardsticks for the reasonableness of classification, it is important to note two crucial qualifications to complete the understanding of this test. First, while establishing a nexus with the object of the statute is necessary, it is not essential to demonstrate that the classification was the optimal method to achieve the object in question. To this end, this Court has held that:134 "33. The nexus test, unlike the proportionality test, is not tailored to narrow down the means or to find the best means to achieve the object. It is sufficient if the means have a “rational nexus” to the object. Therefore, the courts show a greater degree of deference to cases where the rational nexus test is applied.
