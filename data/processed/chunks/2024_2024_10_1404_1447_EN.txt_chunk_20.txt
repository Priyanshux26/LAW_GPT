Numerous s of this Court (similar to the in Express Newspaper (supra) discussed above) speak of the ‘duty to act judicially’. To act ‘judicially’ meant to comply with the principles of natural justice. Courts began diluting the distinction between quasi-judicial and administrative actions to ensure that administrative actions or proceedings by authorities which are not Courts in a strict sense also comply with the principles of natural justice. The term “quasi-judicial” came into vogue to describe the exercise of power which though administrative in some respects was required to be exercised judicially, that is, in accordance with the principles of natural justice because of its impact on the rights of persons affected.65 38. In R v. ex p London Electricity Joint Committee Co. (1920) Ltd.,66 Lord Atkin laid down the following three components of a “quasi- judicial ”: (a) there must be a legal authority; (b) the authority must determine questions affecting rights of subjects; and (c) the authority must have a duty to act judicially. This test has been applied by this Court in Province of Bombay v. Khushaldas S Advani,67 Shivji Nathubhai v. Union of India68 and Indian National Congress (I)69 to determine if a function is quasi-judicial. 62 The King v.

Digital Supreme Court Reports 39. In Khushaldas S Advani (supra), the issue before a four-Judge Bench of this Court was whether an requisitioning a flat under Section 3 of the Bombay Land Requisition Ordinance70 was quasi- judicial. Section 3 of the Ordinance stipulated that the Provincial Government may by an in writing requisition any land for a public purpose provided that it is necessary or expedient to do so. Sections 10 and 11 of the Ordinance stipulated that the Provincial Government may obtain information, enter and inspect land. One of the arguments was that a decision is quasi-judicial whenever there is a determination of a fact which affects the rights of parties.71 40. Chief Justice Harilal Kania held that the test to be applied to determine if a decision is quasi-judicial is if the law under which the authority is making a decision itself requires a quasi-judicial approach. The learned Chief Justice considered two factors in arriving at the conclusion that Section 3 of the Ordinance did not confer a quasi- judicial power: first, whether the opinion can be revised by another authority or whether it can only be challenged on the grounds on which legislative actions are challenged;72 and second, Sections 10 and 11 of the Ordinance which conferred the Provincial Government with the power to inspect and make inquires, were not mandatorily required to be followed.
