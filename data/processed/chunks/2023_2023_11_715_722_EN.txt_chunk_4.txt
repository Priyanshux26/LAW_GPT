It may be noted that even in a case where the fi nal report of the police under Section 173 is accepted and the accused persons are discharged, the Magistrate has ZUNAID v. STATE OF UP. & ORS. 721 the power to take cognizance of the off ence on a complaint or a Protest Petition on the same or similar allegations even after the acceptance of the fi nal report. As held by this Court in Gopal Vijay Verma Vs. Bhuneshwar Prasad Sinha and Others2, as followed in B. Chandrika Vs. Santhosh and Another3, a Magistrate is not debarred from taking cognizance of a complaint merely on the ground that earlier he had declined to take cognizance of the police report. No doubt a Magistrate while exercising his judicial discretion has to apply his mind to the contents of the Protest Petition or the complaint as the case may be. 12. So far as the facts of the present case are concerned, the concerned CJM vide the detailed passed on 15.11.2018 had rejected the fi nal report submitted by the Investigating Offi cer and had accepted the Protest Petition, and decided to proceed further under Section 200 Cr.P.C. Such a course opted by the CJM was absolutely just, legal and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case. The said dated 15.11.2018 remained unchallenged at the instance of the respondents-accused. It was only when the concerned CJM after recording the statements of the complainant and eight witnesses, issued summons on 11.01.2022, the respondents fi led the application challenging the said dated 11.01.2022 under Section 482 before the High Court, and in the said application, the dated 15.11.2018 came to be challenged by way of amendment. As such, the High Court should not have permitted the respondents-accused to amend the Application for challenging the dated 15.11.2018 after about four years of its passing, and in any case should not have interfered with the discretion exercised by the CJM within the four corners of law. The discretionary of 11.01.2022 passed by the concerned CJM issuing summons to the accused, after recording statements of the complainant and the eight witnesses and after recording prima facie satisfaction about the commission of the alleged crime, also did not warrant any interference by the High Court. In our opinion, the High Court has committed gross error in setting aside the s dated 15.11.2018 and 11.01.2022 passed by the CJM. 2 (1982) 3 SCC 510 3 (2014) 13 SCC 699 722 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 13. In that view of the matter the impugned s passed by the High Court being highly erroneous, the same are quashed and set aside. The concerned CJM is directed to proceed with the complaint case in accordance with law. It shall be open for the respondents-accused to respond to the summons and appear before the concerned CJM within two weeks. 14. The appeals stand allowed accordingly. 15. Pending application(s), if any, also stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by : Appeals allowed.
