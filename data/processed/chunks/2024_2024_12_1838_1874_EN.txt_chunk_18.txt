Recognizing Orans as forests aligns with both domestic legal mandates and international commitments, fostering a harmonious balance between cultural heritage and biodiversity conservation for present and future generations. 52. This Court in I.A. No. 1254 of Writ Petition No. 202 of 1995 has noted that recommendations of the CEC have to be complied with by the State of Rajasthan. The three recommendations as given by the CEC can be summarised as follows: (i) The Kapoor Committee classified only sacred groves, such as Orans and Dev-vans, meeting the deemed forest criteria (200+ trees/ha and 5+ ha compact blocks) as forests, excluding smaller areas despite their recognition in government records. Traditionally, the Orans are treated as forest lands in Rajasthan, but the exclusion of such areas in government records on the ground that they do not fulfil the criteria of the deemed forests, contradicts this Court’s s. The CEC has recommended including these sacred groves as forest land unless their exclusion, due to management challenges, by following the procedure outlined in the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. (ii) The Kapoor Committee’s inclusion of areas recorded as ‘Rundh’ as ‘forest’ is apropos and may be accepted. However, many of these areas were converted for agriculture or other non-forestry uses before the FC Act came into effect on 25.10.1980 and have been in use for such purposes since decades. It is recommended that these pre-25.10.1980 converted areas be identified, surveyed, and demarcated in a time-bound manner and removed from the purview of the FC Act, following due legal process. To facilitate this, the Ministry of Environment and Forests may consider waiving requirements for compensatory afforestation and payment of Net Present Value(NPV) for these cases. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1869 In Re: T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India & Ors. (iii) In Rajasthan, large arid areas with sparse vegetation, grasslands, and unique desert ecosystems, including rocky outcrops and stony deserts, should be considered as ‘forest land.’ To address this, it is proposed that an Expert Committee be formed, comprising of representatives from the Forest Department, Arid Zone Forestry Research Institute (AFRI), Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), and other expert bodies. This Committee would identify areas representing diverse desert ecosystems and recommend their inclusion as ‘deemed forests,’ regardless of the vegetation density. The Committee may adopt rational criteria for this purpose and submit its report within six months. VII. DIRECTIONS 53. Pursuant to the s of this Court, the State of Rajasthan has initiated the process of identifying and notifying sacred groves as forests through district-wise notifications. While this development is commendable, it is important to highlight the significant delay in commencing this critical process. Sacred groves of Rajasthan, which hold immense ecological value and are deeply revered in local cultures, urgently require formal recognition and protection to safeguard their preservation. The applicant in the present case has given a list identifying 100 sacred groves in the State of Rajasthan. The list provided by the applicant is extracted below: S. Name S. Name No. No. 1.
