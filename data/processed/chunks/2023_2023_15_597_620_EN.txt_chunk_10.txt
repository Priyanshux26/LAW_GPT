It is thus clear that the said recognition was issued so that the directives of MHRD for implementing the 2017 Amendment Act were duly fulfi lled. It appears that since the time-gap between the directions issued by MHRD and 31st March 2019 was only about 18 months, the period of course was reduced from 2 years to 18 months. This position would be clarifi ed from the said recognition itself, which reads thus: “II. Any provision related to the duration of the Programme so as to reduce it to 18 months instead of 2 years and the requirement of 6 months internship to be subsumed within the duration of 18 months” 26. The letter dated 11th October 2017 addressed by the Additional Secretary, MHRD to the Secretaries to the State Governments would further clarify this position. Around 12,91,880 in-service elementary teachers had registered and made payment on the NIOS portal as on 30th September 2017. It is also clear from the said communication that the said course was exclusively made for ensuring that only in-service elementary teachers are registered for D.El.Ed. course. 27. It is further to be noted that a communication was addressed by the Additional Chief Secretary, Education Department, Government of Bihar seeking clarifi cation with regard to appointment of Primary Teachers possessing D.El.Ed. (ODL) qualifi cation from NIOS. It will be relevant to refer to the reply of NCTE dated 6th September 2019, which reads thus: 612 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. “I am directed to refer to your letter dated 29-08-2019 on the subject noted above and to say that your representation regarding appointment of primary teachers qualifi ed with D.El.Ed. (ODL) from NIOS has been examined. The primary notifi cations are those dated 23-08- 20l0 and 29-07-2011 (determination of minimum qualifi cations for appointment of teachers, Appendix-9 and the dated 22-09- 2017 issued from NRC, NCTE to NIOS granting recognition to D.El.Ed. (ODL) Programme. The following points are inferred from the above notifi cations (copies enclosed). I. As per the NCTE Notifi cation dated 23-08-2010 and 29-07-2011 one of the minimum qualifi cation for appointment of teachers for class I-V and VI- VIII is two year Diploma in Elementary Education (emphasis added). II. As per the NRC NCTE dated 22-09-2017 the D.El.Ed. (ODL) programme of NIOS is only for those un-trained in-service teachers in Govt./Govt. aided/private unaided schools appointed on or before 10-08-2017. The duration of this programme is 18 months (emphasis added). 2. Hence for the fresh appointment of teachers for primary and upper ‘primary level, the notifi cation dated 23-08-2010 and 29-07-2011 need to be strictly adhered to TET is also a mandatory requirement.” 28. It can thus clearly be seen that as on 6th September 2019, it is also the view of the NCTE that the minimum qualifi cations for appointment of teachers for Class I to VIII is a 2 years Diploma in Elementary Education. It further clarifi es that NCTE recognition dated 22nd September 2017 was only for those untrained in-service teachers in Government/Government Aided/Unaided Private Schools, who were appointed on or before 10th August 2017.
