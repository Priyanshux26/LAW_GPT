While dealing with the report sent by the subordinate court under 22 Rule 5 of CPC, the Appellate Court may consider the findings of the subordinate court and then give its reasons before reaching any conclusion. The words ‘the Appellate Court may take the same into consideration in determining the question’ used in the proviso to Rule 5 gives discretion to the Appellate Court to make its own separate opinion notwithstanding the opinion of the subordinate court. The proviso cannot be construed to be a delegation of the powers of the Appellate Court to substitute the deceased party, but is merely to assist it in ultimately deciding the issue of substitution. Thus, the Appellate Court ‘may’ take into consideration the material referred by the subordinate court under Rule 5 of 22, CPC along with the objections, if any, against the report while deciding on the substitution of the appellant. 18. We, therefore, set aside the dated 19.06.2019 and 30.01.2019, and remit the matter back to the High Court for a fresh decision on substitution. We reiterate that we have said nothing on the merit of the relative claims of the contenders, our concern and our reasons for yet again sending the matter back were only on the procedure. 19. Accordingly, these appeals stand disposed of along with the pending application(s), if any. Headnotes prepared by: Result of the case: Mukund P Unny, Hony. Associate Editor Appeals disposed of.
