He submitted that, since it was a case of horizontal reservation, it was not possible to shift the category of vertical reservation like the SC/ST/OBC/EWS to the horizontal category of UR-GS. 10. By now, it is a well-settled principle of law that a candidate belonging to any of the vertical reservation categories who on the basis of his own merit is entitled to be selected in the open or general category, will be selected against the general category and his selection would not be counted against the quota reserved for such vertical reservation categories. Reliance in this respect could be placed on the 9-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Indra Sawhney and Others v. Union of India and Others,3 and in the cases of R.K. Sabharwal and Others v. State of Punjab and Others4 and Ritesh R. Sah v. Dr. Y.L. Yamul and Others.5 11. However, this Court, in the case of Saurav Yadav (supra), had 2 [2019] 15 SCR 93 : (2020) 17 SCC 465 : 2019 INSC 1362 3 [1992] Supp. 2 SCR 454 : 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 4 [1995] 2 SCR 35 : (1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 INSC 108 5 [1996] 2 SCR 695 : (1996) 3 SCC 253 : 1996 INSC 258 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 923 Ramnaresh @ Rinku Kushwah and Others v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Others an occasion to consider for the first time as to whether the said principle laid down in the case of Indra Sawhney (supra) and followed subsequently would also apply to the cases of horizontal reservation. Prior to the said , there were conflicting views of different High Courts. This Court, after surveying various earlier pronouncements and considering the views as expressed by the High Courts, observed thus: “43. Finally, we must say that the steps indicated by the High Court of Gujarat in para 69 of its in Tamannaben Ashokbhai Desai [Tamannaben Ashokbhai Desai v. Shital Amrutlal Nishar, 2020 SCC OnLine Guj 2592] contemplate the correct and appropriate procedure for considering and giving effect to both vertical and horizontal reservations. The illustration given by us deals with only one possible dimension. There could be multiple such possibilities. Even going by the present illustration, the first female candidate allocated in the vertical column for Scheduled Tribes may have secured higher position than the candidate at Serial No. 64. In that event said candidate must be shifted from the category of Scheduled Tribes to Open/General category causing a resultant vacancy in the vertical column of Scheduled Tribes. Such vacancy must then enure to the benefit of the candidate in the waiting list for Scheduled Tribes-Female. The steps indicated by the Gujarat High Court will take care of every such possibility. It is true that the exercise of laying down a procedure must necessarily be left to the authorities concerned but we may observe that one set out in said will certainly satisfy all claims and will not lead to any incongruity as highlighted by us in the preceding paragraphs.” 12.
