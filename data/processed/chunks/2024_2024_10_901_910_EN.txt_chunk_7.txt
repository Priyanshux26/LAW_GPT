The Trial Court found execution of agreement to be proved and directed for refund of the amount of Rs. 40,000/- by defendant no. 1 to the plaintiff/appellant with further finding on issue no. 5 that the agreement was not a result of fraud and collusion. The defendant did not prefer any cross-appeal or cross-objections against the said partial decree and allowed the finding to become final. The plaintiff was non-suited only on the ground that defendant no. 2 had no notice of the agreement and is a bona fide purchaser. However, once sale agreement is proved and the subsequent sale was during pendency of the suit hit by the doctrine of lis pendens, the High Court was fully justified in setting aside the and decree of the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court and passing a decree for specific performance. 16. In our considered view, the High Court has not committed any error of law in rendering the impugned which is hereby affirmed and the instant appeal deserves to be and is hereby dismissed. No as to costs. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan 5 [2024] 5 SCR 1148 : 2024 INSC 377
