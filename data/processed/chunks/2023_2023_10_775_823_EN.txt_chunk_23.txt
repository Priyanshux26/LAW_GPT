I have had the benefit of reading the detailed and elaborate reasoning of my learned brother judge, Dipankar Datta, J. While I concur with the conclusions and relief granted to the appellant, I wish to record a few observations, by way of abundant caution, on the larger question of reservations in promotions for any class of citizens other than those D covered by Article 16(4-A) of the Constitution. I. HISTORY OF RESERVATIONS IN PROMOTIONS 2. The question of reservations in promotions has a chequered history. In General Manager, S. Rly. v. Rangachari1, a constitution E bench in a 3:2 decision held that reservations in promotions were permissible. They were not merely restricted to initial appointments, but also selected posts subsequently.2 This was a decision rendered during the era when this court’s understanding of Articles 15(4) and 16(4) was that such provisions were exceptions to the rule under Articles 15(1) and 16(1). However, this interpretation underwent a change3, as F elucidated in State of Kerala v N.M. Thomas4, wherein K.K. Mathew, J. opined: “If equality of opportunity guaranteed under Article 16 (1) means effective material equality, then Article 16 (4) is not an exception to Article 16 (1).

A the extent to which equality of opportunity could be carried viz., even up to the point of making reservation”.5 In Indra Sawhney v Union of India6, a nine-judge constitution bench, equipped with this interpretation, revisited the question of reservations in promotions. Question No. 7 was unambiguously cast: B “Whether Article 16 permits reservations being provided in the matter of promotions?” Eight out of nine justices considered the issue, and held that the view expressed in Rangachari (supra)was erroneous, and that reservations in promotions were impermissible under Article 16. 3.
