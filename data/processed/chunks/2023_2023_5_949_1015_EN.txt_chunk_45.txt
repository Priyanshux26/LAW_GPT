On passing the final by the Tribunal that the auditor of a company has, directly or indirectly, acted in a E fraudulent manner, the second consequence as mentioned in the second proviso to section 140(5) shall be attracted. Therefore, for any consequence as provided under the second proviso to section 140(5), there shall be a final by the Tribunal on enquiry as per first part of section 140(5). Therefore, on true interpretation, even on resignation by F an auditor of a company even during the enquiry/proceedings under section 140(5) or even prior to that, there shall not be any termination of the proceedings under section 140(5) as observed and held by the High Court. At the cost of repetition, it is observed that in a given case, an auditor, who in fact has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner, to avoid any further consequence under the second proviso to section G 140(5), resigns to avoid any consequence under the second proviso to section 140(5), it cannot be permitted. 8. No so far as the submission on behalf of the respective auditors that even if section 140(5) would not have been there, in that case also, no auditor can get away with fraud, abetment of fraud or professional H UNION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER V. DELOITTE HASKINS 1009 AND SELLS LLP [M. R. SHAH, J.] misconduct etc. and for that purpose the reliance placed upon sections A 132, 141, 147, 245 and 447 of the Act is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that all the aforesaid provisions and section 140(5) operate in different field. Section 140(5) has been enacted with a special object and purpose, as observed hereinabove. Second proviso to section 140(5) specifically provides that on final being passed by the NCLT, B such an auditor shall not be eligible to become an auditor in any other company for a period of five years. Therefore, merely because the auditor can be removed as an auditor of a company including the other provisions, section 140(5) which has been enacted with a special object and purpose cannot be said to be arbitrary and/or ultra vires. C 9. Now so far as the reliance placed upon section 241(3) of the Act and the submission that even in a case where the auditor resigns, the auditor concerned can be proceeded against under section 241(3) of the Act and therefore the proceedings pursuant to section 241(3) of the Act would lead to the same result and the auditor would be held ‘not to be a fit and proper person’ to be appointed in any other office connected D with the conduct and management of any company is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that Section 241(3) of the Act speaks about the concerned company and not any other company. Section 241(3) of the Act has been introduced w.e.f. 14.08.2019 which authorises the Central Government to apply to the Tribunal to declare that the persons E mentioned in section 241(3) of the Act are “not fit and proper persons” to hold the office of a director or any other office connected with the conduct and management of any company.
