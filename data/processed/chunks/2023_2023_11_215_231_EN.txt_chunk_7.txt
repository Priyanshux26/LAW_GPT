15. Therefore, the scope of jurisdiction under Section 34 and Section 37 of the Act is not akin to normal appellate jurisdiction.9 It is well-settled that courts ought not to interfere with the arbitral award in a casual and cavalier manner. The mere possibility of an alternative view on facts or interpretation of the contract does not entitle courts to reverse the fi ndings of the Arbitral Tribunal.10 In Dyna Technologies Private Limited v. Crompton Greaves Limited (2019) 20 SCC 1, this Court held: “24. There is no dispute that Section 34 of the Arbitration Act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various courts. We need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the court comes to a conclusion that the 5 (2019) 19 SCC 9. 6 (2011) 15 SCC 101. 7 (2008) 13 SCC 80. 8 (2019) 4 SCC 163: “para 14. As far as interference with an made under Section 34, as per Section 37, is concerned, it cannot be disputed that such interference under Section 37 cannot travel beyond the restrictions laid down under Section 34. In other words, the court cannot undertake an independent assessment of the merits of the award, and must only ascertain that the exercise of power by the court under Section 34 has not exceeded the scope of the provision.” 9 UHL Power Company Ltd. v. State of Himachal Pradesh (2022) 2 SCC (Civ) 401, para 15. See also:Dyna Technologies Pvt Ltd v. Crompton Greaves Limited (2019) 20 SCC 1, para 24, 25. 10 ibid; Ssangyong Engineering. & Construction Company Ltd. v. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) (2019) 15 SCC 131; Parsa Kente Collieries Ltd. v. Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd., (2019) 7 SCC 236, para 11.1. KONKAN RAILWAY CORP. LTD v. CHENAB BRIDGE PROJECT 225 UNDERTAKING [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J.] perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. Section 34 is diff erent in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. The mandate under Section 34 is to respect the fi nality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. If the courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated. 25. Moreover, umpteen number of s of this Court have categorically held that the courts should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. The courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.” 16.
