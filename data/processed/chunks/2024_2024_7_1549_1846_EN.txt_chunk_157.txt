v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. c. Entry 50 of List II envisages that Parliament can impose “any limitations” on the legislative field created by that entry under a law relating to mineral development. The MMDR Act as it stands has not imposed any limitations as envisaged in Entry 50 of List II; d. The scope of the expression “any limitations” under Entry 50 of List II is wide enough to include the imposition of restrictions, conditions, principles, as well as a prohibition; e. The State legislatures have legislative competence under Article 246 read with Entry 49 of List II to tax lands which comprise of mines and quarries. Mineral-bearing land falls within the description of “lands” under Entry 49 of List II; f. The yield of mineral bearing land, in terms of the quantity of mineral produced or the royalty, can be used as a measure to tax the land under Entry 49 of List II. The decision in Goodricke (supra) is clarified to this extent; g. Entries 49 and 50 of List II deal with distinct subject matters and operate in different fields. Mineral value or mineral produce can be used as a measure to impose a tax on lands under Entry 49 of List II; h. The “limitations” imposed by Parliament in a law relating to mineral development with respect to Entry 50 of List II do not operate on Entry 49 of List II because there is no specific stipulation under the Constitution to that effect; and i. The decisions in India Cement (supra), Orissa Cement (supra), Federation of Mining Associations of Rajasthan (supra), Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills (supra), Saurashtra Cement (supra), Mahanadi Coalfields (supra), and P Kannadasan (supra) are overruled to the extent of the observations made in the present case. 343. The Registry is directed to take administrative directions from Hon’ble Chief Justice of India for placing the matters before an appropriate Bench. 1748 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
