Shri Narender Hooda submits that the JUR is totally contrary to the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Bhagat Ram & others vs. State of Punjab & others2 (hereinafter referred to as “Bhagat Ram”). It is submitted that the JUR also does not correctly consider the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Ranjit Singh and others vs. State of Punjab and others3 (hereinafter referred to as “Ranjit Singh”) so 2 [1967] 2 SCR 165 : AIR 1967 SC 927 3 [1965] 1 SCR 82 : AIR 1965 SC 632 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 903 Karnail Singh v. State of Haryana & Ors. also another Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Ajit Singh vs. State of Punjab & another4 (hereinafter referred to as “Ajit Singh”). 5. Shri Hooda submits that after considering the provisions of Section 23-A and Section 24 of the East Punjab Holdings (Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Act, 1948 (hereinafter referred to as “the Consolidation Act”), this Court in Bhagat Ram has clearly held that, till possession has changed under Section 24, the management and control does not vest in the Panchayat under Section 23-A. It has also been held that the rights of the holders are not modified or extinguished till persons have changed possession and entered into the possession of the holdings allotted to them under the scheme. He therefore submits that the Full Bench of the High Court in the case of Jai Singh & others vs. State of Haryana5 (hereinafter referred to as “Jai Singh II”) has correctly relying on Bhagat Ram held that the land which is reserved, but not earmarked for any common purpose, would not come under the purview of Section 2(g)(6) of the 1961 Act, as inserted by Haryana Act No.9 of 1992. 6. Shri Hooda submits that the Constitution Bench of this Court in Ajit Singh was dealing with the lands which were reserved for common purposes such as khals, paths, khurrahs, panchayat ghars and schools etc. It was held that in view of Rule 16(ii) of the Punjab Holdings (Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Rules, 1949 (hereinafter referred to as “the Consolidation Rules”), the title still vests in the proprietary body, and the management of the said lands is done on behalf of the proprietary body.
