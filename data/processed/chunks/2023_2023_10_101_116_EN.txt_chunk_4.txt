The judicial trajectory of the case leading to the present stage is set out hereunder: 7 The TNGST (Amendment) Act, 1997 (Act No. 60 of 1997) 8 Dated 25th June, 1999 and 6th July, 1999 H 9 Dated 27th July, 1999 SANTHOSH MAIZE & INDUSTRIES LIMITED v. THE STATE 107 OF TAMIL NADU & ANR. [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] a) Assessment proceedings having been initiated, the appellant A approached the Tamil Nadu Taxation Special Tribunal (“Tribunal”, hereafter) questioning the provisional assessment notices and challenging the validity of the Circular dated 8th October, 1998. The petitions10 came to be dismissed, vide dated 29th July, 1999, with the B observation that it was not proper for the appellant to independently challenge the said Circular and also contest the assessment proceedings at the same time; the questions regarding the validity of the Circular, therefore, could be contested in the assessment proceedings. C b) It was, at this stage, that the appellant resorted to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court seeking quashing of the of the Tribunal dated 29th July, 1999 as well as praying that the Circular dated 08th October, 1998 be declared as ultra vires Section 28-A, Exemption Entry No. 8, and Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 265 of the Constitution of India; alternatively, D it was prayed that the said Circular should only apply prospectively from 08th October, 1998 rather than retroactively from 17th July, 1996. c) The Division Bench of the High Court initially dismissed the appellant’s writ petition on 25th August, 1999, stating E that the appellant could agitate all the points before the assessing authority, who would proceed according to law.

The High Court was of the view 10 Original Petition Nos. 881 and 883 of 1999 11 Civil Appeal Nos. 6176 of 2000 H 108 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A that the Exemption Notification and subsequent circulars issued by the Commissioner, which sought to exempt maize starch from taxation, do not hold binding authority as they lack statutory backing. This is because Section 28-A, which empowers the Commissioner to issue clarifications, only became effective from 6th November, 1997. Circular dated B 8th October, 1998 carries legal validity as it was issued subsequent to the insertion of Section 28-A. Having concluded that maize starch will not be entitled to the benefit of exemption, the High Court upheld the validity of the Circular dated 8th October, 1998 which classified maize C starch under Entry No.
