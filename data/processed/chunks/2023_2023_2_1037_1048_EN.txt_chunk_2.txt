Any person, whose entire identity, and their past, present and future rights are challenged, must at the least be given an opportunity to be fairly heard. In the case at hand however, such a right has been denied to the H 1040 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A Appellant, and hence the burden of proof on the respondents to disprove the nature of the certificate, has not been discharged. In the absence of the discharge of such burden of proof, this Court must presume the community certificate of the Appellant to be genuine. [Paras 22 and 23][1047-C-G] B State of Jharkhand & Ors. v.
