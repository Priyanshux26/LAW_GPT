The reasons for the State Government’s decision to abolish the OAT are recorded in a document titled ‘A note indicating the rationale’ with the subject ‘Abolition of Odisha Administrative Tribunal.’ This note was prepared by the General Administration Department, Government E of Odisha and is dated 16 September 2015. The relevant parts of the note are extracted below: “1. Background Odisha Administrative Tribunal (OAT) was established on 14th July, 1986 under the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985 by F Government of India on the request of Government of Odisha. The Tribunal under the Act was to have similar jurisdiction as the High Court. The applicants were supposed to be freed from the requirement of having to approach the High Court for disposal of their grievances. In lieu of the High Court the aggrieved government employees could go to the Tribunal and G from there on to the Supreme Court directly … 27 [1948] 1 K.B. 223 28 (1991) 3 SCC 91 29 (1994) 6 SCC 651 30 (1999) 4 SCC 727 31 (2003) 5 SCC 437 H 784 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 2. Supreme Court Landmark (18th March, 1997) However, with the decision of the Supreme Court in L Chandra Kumar (1997) the provision of the Act that aggrieved parties could appeal before the Supreme Court against the s of the Tribunal was held unconstitutional … it was held that the parties B aggrieved with the s of the Tribunal may approach the High Court first before going to the Supreme Court … 3. Impact of the Supreme Court As a consequence of the landmark of the Supreme Court, the objective of the establishment of the Tribunal to give quick C justice to the government employees was defeated and several States felt that the existence of the Tribunal was rendered futile.” (emphasis supplied) The State Government enclosed this note with its letter dated 16 September 2015 to the Union Government, requesting it to abolish the D OAT. The relevant portion of the letter is extracted below: “This is to state that the State Administrative Tribunal has been functioning in Odisha since 14.07.1986. Government of Odisha is of the view that the Tribunal is not able to serve its original objectives, particularly after the Hon’ble Apex Court gave the E in L. Chandra Kumar case of 1997. As a result of this , very purpose of having a State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for speedy redressal of the grievances of the State Government employees is not fulfilled as any way the aggrieved parties have to approach F the Hon’ble High Court before approaching the Apex Court for a final verdict. Government of Odisha, after taking into account this, have decided to recommend to the Government of India to abolish the Odisha Administrative Tribunal. A note indicating the rationale adopted G by the State Government in arriving at this decision is enclosed herewith for your ready reference.” (emphasis supplied) 77.
