However, this does not render the notification invalid. The effect of not complying with Article 77 is that the Union Government cannot claim the benefit of the irrebuttable presumption that the notification dated H 744 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 2 August 2019 was issued by the President. Hence, the appellants’ submission that the notification dated 2 August 2019 is invalid and unconstitutional is specious. [Para 102][795-G-H; 796-A] 8.3 Both the notification dated 4 July 1986 and the notification dated 2 August 2019 were, in substance, issued by B the President (acting for the Union Government). The notifications were published in the Gazette of India in accordance with law and there is nothing on record to support the suggestion that an authority which is not empowered to issue the notification has issued it. To the contrary, Section 4 of the Administrative Tribunals Act empowers the Union Government to issue a C notification establishing the OAT and the attendant power to rescind a notification so issued is also available to the Union Government. The issuance of both notifications was an exercise of the Union Government’s statutory power under the Administrative Tribunals Act. [Para 104][796-C-E] D 8.4 Article 77 is a directory provision. Article 77(1) refers to the form in which the decision taken by the executive is to be expressed. This is evident from the phrase “expressed to be taken” in clause (1) of Article 77. It does not have any bearing on the process of decision-making itself. The public or the citizenry E would stand to suffer most from the consequences of declaring an that is not expressed in the name of the President null and void. [Para 107][797-D-E] 8.5 In the instant case, the notification dated 2 August 2019 was issued in exercise of the statutory powers under the Administrative Tribunals Act. Thus, the notification dated 2 F August 2019 is valid despite not being expressed in the name of the President of India. [Para 109, 110][798-H; 799-A] Dattatraya Moreshwar Pangarkar v. State of Bombay (1952) 1 SCC 372; State of Uttaranchal v. Sunil Kumar Vaish (2011) 8 SCC 670 : [2011] 13 SCR 754; Gulf G Goans Hotel Co. Ltd. v. Union of India (2014) 10 SCC 673 : [2014] 10 SCR 536 – held inapplicable. Air India Cabin Crew Assn. v. Yeshaswinee Merchant (2003) 6 SCC 277 : [2003] 1 Suppl. SCR 455 – referred to. H ORISSA ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL BAR ASSOCIATION v. 745 UNION OF INDIA Abolition of the OAT is not violative of the fundamental A right of access to justice 9.1 The fundamental right of access to justice is no doubt a crucial and indispensable right under the Constitution of India. However, it cannot be interpreted to mean that every village, town, or city must house every forum of adjudication created by B statute or the Constitution. It is an undeniable fact that some courts and forums will be located in some towns and cities and not others. Some or the other litigants will be required to travel some distance to access a particular forum or court.
