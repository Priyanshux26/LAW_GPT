Musicians’ Union, 1954 Ch 479 : (1954) 1 All ER 822 (CA) 50 Morelle LD v. Wakeling (1955) 2 QB 379 (Court of Appeal). 626 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 100. A few months after the decision in Morelle (supra), the Constitution Bench of this Court in Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar51 adopted the per incuriam principle. It held that while Article 141 states that the Supreme Court’s decisions are “binding on all courts within the territory of India,” this does not extend to binding the Supreme Court itself, which remains free to reconsider its s in appropriate cases. 101. In Mamleshwar Prasad v. Kanhaiya Lal,52 reflecting on the principle of per incuriam, this Court speaking through Krishna Iyer J. held thus: “7. Certainty of the law, consistency of rulings and comity of courts — all flowering from the same principle — converge to the conclusion that a decision once rendered must later bind like cases. We do not intend to detract from the rule that, in exceptional instances, where by obvious inadvertence or oversight a fails to notice a plain statutory provision or obligatory authority running counter to the reasoning and result reached, it may not have the sway of binding precedents. It should be a glaring case, an obtrusive omission. No such situation presents itself here and we do not embark on the principle of per incuriam.” [emphasis supplied] 102. In A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak,53 the Constitution Bench of this Court made the following observations: “42. It appears that when this Court gave the aforesaid directions on 16-2-1984, for the disposal of the case against the appellant by the High Court, the directions were given oblivious of the relevant provisions or law and the decision in Anwar Ali Sarkar case [State of W.B. v. Anwar Ali Sarkar (1952) 1 SCC 1 : AIR 1952 SC 75 : 1952 Cri LJ 510] . See Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 26, p. 297, para 578 and p. 300, the relevant Notes 8, 11 and 15; Dias on Jurisprudence, 5th Edn., pp. 51 AIR 1955 SC 661 52 [1975] 3 SCR 834 : (1975) 2 SCC 232 53 [1988] Supp. 1 SCR 1 : (1988) 2 SCC 602 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 627 M/s Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rambha Devi & Ors. 128 and 130; Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd. [Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd., 1944 KB 718 (CA)] Also see the observations of Lord Goddard in Moore v. Hewitt [Moore v. Hewitt, 1947 KB 831] and Nicholas v. Penny [Nicholas v. Penny (1950) 2 KB 466] . “Per incuriam” are those decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provision or of some authority binding on the court concerned, so that in such cases some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based, is found, on that account to be demonstrably wrong.
