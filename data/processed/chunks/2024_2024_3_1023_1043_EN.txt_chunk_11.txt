14. Appearing on behalf of the applicant, Dr. Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel, relied on five s of this Court in which post-disposal applications were entertained. The first one was an dated 29.10.2018 in the case of Energy Watchdog -vs- Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and Others, [MA Nos.2705-2706 of 2018 in Civil Appeal Nos.5399-5400 of 2016]. In that case, an application for impleadment on behalf of the State of Gujarat was allowed, upon going through a High Power Committee’s report, which was given after the was delivered. The disposing of the Civil Appeal was delivered on 11.04.2017, but in the miscellaneous application, the applicant was given liberty to approach the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission for approval of the proposed amendments to be made to a power purchase agreement. That was a case where this Court, after the was delivered, considered certain events which accrued subsequently and had a bearing on the main decision. The subsequent event was taken into account for modifying the but there was no substantive change in the itself. 15. The next , on which Dr. Singhvi placed reliance, was passed on 04.05.2023 in the case of Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Anr. -vs- Adani Power (Mundra) Limited [MA (D) No. 18461 of 2023 in Civil Appeal No.2908 of 2022]. The substantive part of the is contained in Paragraph 2 thereof and this paragraph reads:- “2. As agreed by the learned counsel for the parties, the words “As per the details given in the PPA, the mode of transportation is through railway” shown in paragraph 32 of the dated 20.04.2023 passed in C.A. No. 2908 of 2022 be read as “As per the details given in the FSA, the mode of transportation is through railway”. But this appears to be in the nature of correcting an error which was clerical in nature and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“the Code”) itself provides for such correction under Section 152 thereof, as also XII Rule 3 of the 2013 Rules. 16. The third relied on by Dr. Singhvi was passed on 09.12.2022 in the case of Kalpataru Properties Pvt. Ltd. -vs- Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. [MA No.2064 of 2022 in Civil Appeal No.7050 of 2022]. The applicant therein had approached this Court contending that he was not heard when the civil appeal was decided. In that case, the 1040 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports appellant had approached this Court against an passed by NCLAT in Company Appeal (AT)(Insolvency) No. 880/2021 and the said appellant sought to withdraw the appeal on deposit of certain amount by the first respondent in the said appeal. The request was accepted by this Court and by the passed on 26.09.2022, the appeal pending before the NCLAT was also disposed of by this Court. The applicant was an intervenor before the NCLAT and his submission was that in the appeal before the NCLAT which was disposed of, he also sought to raise some grievances before the NCLAT, in his capacity as an intervenor.
