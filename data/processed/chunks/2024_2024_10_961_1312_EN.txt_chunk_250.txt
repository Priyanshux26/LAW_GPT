Once the question of whether a person is a foreigner is referred to the Foreigners Tribunal,206 the reference is decided based on the following procedure: a. Upon receiving the reference from the Central Government or any competent authority, the Tribunal must serve a show-cause notice on the person to whom the question relates207 within ten days from the receipt of the reference;208 b.

In addition to the above, the Tribunals also prescribes detailed provisions regarding the service of notice indicating that the core tenets of natural justice must be provided to the person suspected to be a foreigner.214 The Tribunals have the powers of a civil court while trying a suit under the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 and the powers of a Judicial Magistrate First Class under the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973.215 The of the Foreigners Tribunal, being an of a quasi-judicial body is subject to judicial review before the High Court and then this Court. 117. Clause 5.4 of the Assam Accord states that the foreigners who were detected to have entered between 1966 to 1971 were required to register before the Registration Officers in accordance with the provisions of the Registration of Foreigners Act 1939 and the Registration of Foreigners Rules 1939. The Assam Accord devised a model in which upon detection as a foreigner, they would have to register in the existing mechanism. 118. However, Section 6A deviated from the Assam Accord in this regard. Section 6A(3) stipulates that upon detection, the person must register themselves in accordance with the rules “made by the Central Government in this behalf under Section 18”. The Citizenship Rules were amended by a notification dated 15 January 1987216 including Rules 16D, 16E and 16F. These Rules implement the substantive provisions of Section 6A(3). Rule 16D provides that a fresh reference must be made to the Foreigners Tribunal if the question of whether a person satisfies the condition under Section 6A arises.
