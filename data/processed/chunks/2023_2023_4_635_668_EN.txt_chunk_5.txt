No ground for further adjournment. Last opportunity was granted to Petitioner on 9.9.97 & then on 1.11.97. Still the Petitioner has not cared to call witness. The PE is thus closed. F Since the relationship of Landlord tenant itself is under dispute and the petitioner has failed to adduce any evidence to establish this fact, I am of the opinion that there is no point in fixing the case further for RE. The petition is thus dismissed as the petitioner has failed to establish his case. File be consigned. G Sd/- 27.1.1998 R. Kiran Nath RENT CONTROLLER: DELHI” H 642 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 9. It is not in dispute that no appeal was preferred against the aforesaid dismissing the eviction petition. During the life time of the original plaintiff, namely, Samey Singh, no fresh eviction petition under Section 14(1)(a) of the Act 1958 was filed. 10. After the demise of Samey Singh (original plaintiff), the B appellants herein claiming as successors in interest filed another eviction petition registered as Eviction Petition No. 136 of 2001 against the respondents herein under Section 14(1)(a) of the Act 1958 claiming inter alia arrears of rent from 01.03.1993 till the date of issuance of notice i.e. till 18.05.2001. A written statement was filed by the respondents herein taking the stance that Samey Singh (the original plaintiff of the C first eviction petition) i.e. the predecessor in interest of the appellants herein had failed to prove the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties and in such circumstances, the same cannot be permitted to be reopened in the second eviction petition as the same would be barred by the principles of res judicata. D 11. It appears that the respondents herein preferred an application under the provisions of 7 Rule 11 of the CPC stating that the Eviction Petition No. 136 of 2001 was barred by the principles of res judicata and the plaint be rejected accordingly. 12. The Additional Rent Controller declined to reject the plaint E vide dated 23.07.2002. The Additional Rent Controller while rejecting the application filed by the respondents for rejecting of the plaint took the view that the second eviction petition filed under Section 14(1)(a) of the Act 1958 was based on a fresh notice dated 18.05.2001 on separate cause of action and that there was no finding on merits as regards the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties in the F dated 27.01.1998 referred to above. The Additional Rent Controller in such circumstances took the view that the plea of res judicata was not tenable in law. The application under 7 Rule 11(d) of the CPC was accordingly rejected. 13. The respondents herein being dissatisfied with the passed G by the Additional Rent Controller challenged the same by filing the Civil Revision Petition No. 1332 of 2002 in the High Court of Delhi. 14. The High Court allowed the civil revision petition and rejected the plaint of the Eviction Petition No. 136 of 2001 on the ground that the same was hit by the principles of res judicata.
