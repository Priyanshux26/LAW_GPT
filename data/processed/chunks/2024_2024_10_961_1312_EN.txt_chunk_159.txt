The White Paper mentions the following about the working of foreigners tribunals prior to the student-led agitation: - "The number of Foreigner’s Tribunals established has varied from time to time, according to the requirements of the situation. The Foreigner’s Tribunals established after 1964 were gradually wound up between December 31, 1969 and March 1, 1973 in phases when they were no longer found necessary as most of the infiltrators had been deported. Besides, with the issue of revised procedure for deportation of Pakistani infiltrators in June 1969, it was decided that fresh references for the Foreigners Tribunals were to be dispensed with and the existing Tribunals were to continue only till the old pending cases were disposed of. For the residue work, the task was to be by the normal course of law. However, the Foreigner’s Tribunals were revived in 1979, and 10 Foreigners Tribunals were constituted on July 4, 1979. The Foreigner’s Tribunals co-existed with IM(D)Ts with the signing of the Assam Accord.
