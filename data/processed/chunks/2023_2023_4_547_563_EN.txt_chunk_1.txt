[Para 21][562-C-E] 1.2 The expiry of leases, or other arrangements, by efflux of time or their valid terminations, in the past, cannot be construed to mean that such lessees become “encroachers”. Nor would E past tenants whose possession is disputed, and eviction proceedings pending against them before a court, fit that description under Section 3 (ee). The consequences of such an interpretation would be too startling; even before an adjudication of the validity of termination (of leases, for instance), tenants holding over would be exposed to prosecution. There is no F allusion to “continuing offence” or any expression suggesting that such a term (mentioned in Section 472 Cr. PC) would be attracted to actions which commenced in the past, i.e., before the amendment of 2013 came into force. To hold otherwise, this court would be resorting to an interpretation that directly deprives G the appellants of their rights under Article 20(1) - a consequence that cannot be countenanced. The plain text of that provision forbids such an interpretation, and the authorities on that aspect clearly indicate that giving effect to a penal statute so as to cover past acts is a proscribed action in law. Therefore, the expression H P. V. NIDHISH & ORS. v. KERALA STATE WAKF BOARD & 549 ANR. “Whoever alienates or purchases or takes possession of”, which is A the opening phrase of Section 52A, cannot be read or construed to include possession taken in the past, which resulted in continued possession, when the provision was enacted. Section 52A cannot cover cases where leases of wakf properties had expired in the past and where the tenant or lessee was, at the B time the amendment of 2013 came into force, in physical possession and facing civil proceedings for eviction. It is a matter of record that the Kerala High Court quashed the of the CEO of the respondent allowing a revision petition and setting aside the eviction of the tenant. The High Court set aside the finding that the tenant was an encroacher. The entire matter was C remitted for fresh consideration, by the Wakf Tribunal. The impugned cannot be sustained; it is set aside. [Paras 22-24][562-F-H; 563-A-C, F] Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State of Vindhya Pradesh [1953] SCR 1188 – followed.
