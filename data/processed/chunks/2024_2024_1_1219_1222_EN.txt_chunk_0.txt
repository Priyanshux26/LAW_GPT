This Special Leave Petition is against the decision of the High Court1 in dismissing an application for restoration of a Civil Revision Application and the accompanying application for condonation of delay in sheer exasperation.

A simple prayer was made by the petitioners in a suit for declaration that the property belonging to the joint family, but their father wrongly sold it to third parties through a sale deed in the year 1980. 3. The suit came to be dismissed for default for not paying the process fee for service of notice on the LRs. of defendant no.2. The petitioners therefore filed an application for restoration in 1993. 4. This application for restoration was decided after seven years and the Trial Court on 04.02.2000 dismissed the application on the ground that it was filed under IX Rule 9 of the CPC whereas it ought to have been filed under IX Rule 4 of the CPC as the suit was originally dismissed under IX, Rule 2 of the CPC. The petitioner filed an appeal against this . 5. After three years, the appeal came to be dismissed on 25.06.2003. The petitioner then filed a revision petition in which the High Court issued notice.
