The single judge considered the previous s of the committee and said that it placed reliance on the s of this court and also clarified that production C capacity had been determined on the basis of “Consent to Operate” as “any other criteria for deciding the capacity will be highly contentious issue and will be fraught with endless interpretation.” The court also held that the Public Notice dated 17.04.2020 was not challenged by Rain CII and, absent such challenge, it was not for the court to adjudicate whether a certificate issued by the APPCB certifying D the production capacity of M/s. Sanvira Industries in the absence of the Consent to Operate as on 09.10.2018 would suffice for making allocation of RPC in its favour. The court also held that the validity of the APPCBcertifying the production capacity of M/s. Sanvira Industries as on 09.10.2018 was not in challenge. On the basis of all these reasoning, E Rain CII’s petition was rejected. 14. Rain CII preferred appeals and writ petitions to the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court4, challenging the of the Single Judge and also impugning the public notice dated 17.04.2020. The Division Bench, in its impugned , held that on 09.10.2018, when this F court passed the , every calciner had given its capacity. The total capacity of all the calciners put together came to 11,72,750 MTPAs and the production and the total import that was necessary for the calciners to continue producing pet coke from raw pet coke was assessed as 1.4 MMTPA. This was based entirely on the total production capacity. On 09.10.2018, Sanvira’s recognition to increase its capacity from 2,00,000 G Metric Tonnes to 3,30,000 MT had not been placed, rather the consent to operate dated 22.04.2017 restricted Sanvira to produce only 200000MT of pet coke. The impugned held that Sanvira’s increased 4 LPA 25/2021; LPA 70/2021; LPA 71/2021, W.P. (C) 5749/2021, and W.P. (C) 6258/ 2022 Rain CII Carbon (VIZAG) Ltd. vs. Union of India and Ors. H 148 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A capacity (of 1,30,000 MT) was granted only on the basis of an agenda item placed before the APPCB on 29.11.2018 and that though Sanvira could produce 3,30,000 MTs, that did not automatically lead to the inference that they were entitled to an increase in their share of the total import permissible by the s of this court, dated 09.10.2018. The court also held that the fixation of 1.4 MMTs per annum was on the B basis of the total capacity of each of the calciners. It was held that minor adjustments or a few more persons were permitted to get a share of the raw pet coke without affecting the capacity given under the EPCA Report did not mean that the total permissible capacity was variable for the reason that the inter se allocation was made only on theallocation of C the capacity essentially on the six calciners. The reasoning made in the of the single judge that the public notice dated 17.04.2020 distinguishes between the certificate in the first part and the consent to operate in the second part and if both, the certificate and consent to operate, were of the same document, then there was no need to mention both in the two parts of the public notice and thus granting of certificate by APPCB D was reasonable, was held to be contrary to the entire scheme as envisaged by this court.
