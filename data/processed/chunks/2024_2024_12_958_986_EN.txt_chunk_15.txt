2,500/- per month for a period of 6 months. Considering the same, the learned Tribunal awarded Rs. 2,500 x 6 = Rs. 15,000/- under the head of attendant charges. 45. In appeal, the High Court, in paragraph 3 of the impugned and , observed that owing to the condition to which the appellant has been reduced, she would require the services of an attendant, though part-time. Accordingly, the High Court adopted the minimum wages of an unskilled worker in the State of Delhi at the time of the accident being Rs. 3,934/-, for a part time attendant, and applied the multiplier of 18. Considering the same, the High Court computed attendant charges to be awarded as Rs. (3,934/- ÷ 2) x 12 x 18 = Rs. 4,24,872/- and rounded it off to Rs. 4,25,000/-. 46. We find that, the approach of the High Court on appreciation of the evidence that the appellant would only be requiring a part time attendant is erroneous. On the contrary, we are of the opinion that the appellant, would be dependent on an attendant throughout her 982 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports life and on a full-time basis. Considering her medical situation, the attendant would have to be skilled and not unskilled. The appellant would be requiring special care and attention which can only be provided by a skilled attendant. It was, therefore, incorrect on the part of the High Court to proceed on the basis that the appellant could be taken care of by an unskilled attendant and that too on a part-time basis. 47. In this respect, it will be relevant to refer to paragraphs 22, 23 and 24 of Kajal (supra), which read thus: “Attendant charges 22. The attendant charges have been awarded by the High Court @ Rs 2500 per month for 44 years, which works out to Rs 13,20,000. Unfortunately, this system is not a proper system. Multiplier system is used to balance out various factors. When compensation is awarded in lump sum, various factors are taken into consideration. When compensation is paid in lump sum, this Court has always followed the multiplier system. The multiplier system should be followed not only for determining the compensation on account of loss of income but also for determining the attendant charges, etc. This system was recognised by this Court in Gobald Motor Service Ltd. v. R.M.K. Veluswami [Gobald Motor Service Ltd. v. R.M.K. Veluswami, AIR 1962 SC 1] . The multiplier system factors in the inflation rate, the rate of interest payable on the lump sum award, the longevity of the claimant, and also other issues such as the uncertainties of life. Out of all the various alternative methods, the multiplier method has been recognised as the most realistic and reasonable method. It ensures better justice between the parties and thus results in award of “just compensation” within the meaning of the Act. 23. It would be apposite at this stage to refer to the observation of Lord Reid in Taylor v. O’Connor [Taylor v. O’Connor, 1971 AC 115 : (1970) 2 WLR 472 (HL)] : (AC p. 128) [2024] 12 S.C.R.
