In the case on hand, the 1strespondent has filed the suit challenging only the Special General Council Meeting held on 11.07.2022. When the 1st respondent did not challenge the Resolutions passed in the General Council Meeting held on 23.06.2022, an of status quo ante as on 23.06.2022 cannot E be granted. 48. So far as the direction to the appellant and the 1st respondent (in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022) to conduct the Executive Council Meeting or General Council Meeting jointly is not workable, as the appellant and the 1st respondent have not been able to act F together and there has been a deadlock, which has resulted in the impossibility to perform the functions, which is the very premise based on which the General Council of the Party was held on 12.09.2017, wherein the posts of Co-Ordinator and the Joint Co- Ordinator were created and the appellant and the 1st respondent came to be elected to the said posts. G 49. Since the appellant-Joint Co-Ordinator, by his letter dated 28.06.2022 to the Election Commission of India, has stated that his post along with the post of Co-Ordinator had lapsed, as already stated, he cannot be compelled to continue in the said post. That H 1156 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A apart, the 1st respondent (in O.S.A.No.227 of 2022) alone cannot take any decision independently. In these circumstances, we are not giving any finding with regard to the stand taken by the appellant that the posts of Co-Ordinator and Joint Co-Ordinator had lapsed for want of ratification on 23.06.2022. The said issue can be decided in the pending suit. B 50. The ratio laid down in the s relied upon by the learned Senior Counsels appearing for the appellant squarely applies to the facts and circumstances of the present case. The ratio laid down by the Gauhati High Court in an unreported judgement made in CRP No.22(AP) of 2015[cited supra] applies to the case of C the 1st respondent. 51. Though there is no dispute with regard to the ratio laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the reported in 1990 Supp (1) SCC 727 (cited supra) relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 1st respondent, since the facts D and circumstances of the present case differs, the said ratio is not applicable to the present case. 52. For the reasons stated above, the passed by the learned Single Judge in the Original Application in O.A.No. 368 of 2022 in C.S. No.118 of 2022 and the Original Applications in O.A. Nos. E 370 and 379 of 2022 in C.S.No. 119 of 2022 are set aside. Consequently, the Original Applications in O.A.Nos.368, 370 and 379 of 2022 are dismissed. The above Original Side Appeals are allowed. No costs. Consequently, the connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.” F 14.
