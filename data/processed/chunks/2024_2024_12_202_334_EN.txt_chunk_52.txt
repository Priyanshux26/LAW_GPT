The view that the “Proper Officer” for the purpose of Section 28 and other provisions of the Act, 1962 could only mean the person who cleared the goods or the officer who succeeds such officer and not any other officer from any other department requires reconsideration in view of the changes to the Act, 1962 vide the Finance Act, 2011 and also in the light of Section 4 and the notification issued thereunder. 111.
