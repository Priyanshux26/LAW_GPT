But what does that fact matter? If a man is negligently run over or otherwise negligently injured in his body, it is no answer to the sufferer’s claim for damages that he would have suffered less injury , or no injury at all, if he had not had an unusually thin skull or an unusually weak heart. 20 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability For Physical and Emotional Harm, American Law Institute, 2010. 21 Geistfeld, 2021 (supra) 22 (1901) 2 KB 669 770 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports  Griffiths LJ, in White and Others v. Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and Others observed in regards to this rule, as follows- “…The law expects reasonable fortitude and robustness of its citizens and will not impose liability for the exceptional frailty of certain individuals. This is not to be confused with the “eggshell skull” situation, where as a result of a breach of duty the damage inflicted proves to be more serious than expected. It is a threshold test of breach of duty; before a defendant will be held in breach of duty to a bystander he must have exposed them to a situation in which it is reasonably foreseeable that a person of reasonable robustness and fortitude would be likely to suffer psychiatric injury…”  The Supreme Court of Canada, in an appeal arising out of the Court of Appeal for British Colombia, Athey v. Leonati23 observed that this case in its own words, is one of “straightforward application of the thin skull rule.” The application of the rule as made herein, underscores the existence of pre-existing conditions. The relevant paragraphs are as follows:- 43 The findings of the trial judge indicate that it was necessary to have both the pre-existing condition and the injuries from the accidents to cause the disc herniation in this case. She made a positive finding that the accidents contributed to the injury, but that the injuries suffered in the two accidents were “not the sole cause” of the herniation. She expressly found that “the herniation was not unrelated 23 [1996] 3 SCR 458 [2024] 4 S.C.R. 771 Jyoti Devi v. Suket Hospital & Ors. to the accidents” and that the accidents “contributed to some degree” to the subsequent herniation. She concluded that the injuries in the accidents “played some causative role, albeit a minor one”. These findings indicate that it was the combination of the pre-existing condition and the injuries sustained in the accidents which caused the herniation. Although the accidents played a lesser role than the pre-existing problems, the accidents were nevertheless a necessary ingredient in bringing about the herniation. 44 The trial judge’s conclusion on the evidence was that “[i]n my view, the plaintiff has proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the injuries suffered in the two earlier accidents contributed to some degree to the subsequent disc herniation”. She assessed this contribution at 25 percent. This falls outside the de minimis range and is therefore a material contribution: Bonnington Castings, Ltd. v. Wardlaw, supra.
