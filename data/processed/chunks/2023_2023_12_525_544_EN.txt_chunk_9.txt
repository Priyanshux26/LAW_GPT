The Court shall also presume that any offi cer by whom any such document purports to be signed or certifi ed, held, when he signed it, the offi cial character which he claims in such paper.” 23. In view of the provision under Section 79 of the Evidence Act, Section 57 (5) of the Registration Act assumes relevance in the context of the case and it reads thus: 538 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. “57. Registering offi cers to allow inspection of certain books and indexes, and to give certifi ed copies of entries.— (1).. (2).. (3).. (4).. (5) All copies given under this section shall be signed and sealed by the registering offi cer, and shall be admissible for the purpose of proving the contents of the original documents.” (Underline supplied) 24.Now, we will have to consider the cumulative effect of the aforementioned provisions as relates the certifi ed copy of the sale deed No.1209/1928 dated 27.08.1928 (Annexure P1) produced by the appellant- plaintiff . 25. While considering the said question it is very relevant to refer to point Nos. 8 and 9 raised on behalf of the defendant No.3 viz., respondent in this appeal. They read thus:- “8. Exhibit A1 is an ancient document in terms of Section 90 of the Evidence Act and the presumption is limited to Extent that it was executed. 9. The execution of document not in dispute and there is no need to raise presumption u/s 90.” 26. Point Nos.8 and 9 as stated above raised by the defendant in this appeal would reveal that he did not dispute the execution of Ext.A1 sale deed No.1209/1928 dated 27.08.1928. A bare perusal of Ext.A1 would reveal that the subject property involved in the transaction eff ected thereunder is the property in Survey No.845/1, having an extent of 2 acres and 61 cents situated at Thimmarasanaickanur village in Madurai District. Therefore, the question is whether the appellant/plaintiff has proved the contents of Ext. A1 in terms of the Evidence Act. 27. The relevant aspects which are to be borne in mind while considering the aforesaid question are that indisputably Ext.A1 is a registered APPAIYA v. ANDIMUTHU @ THANGAPANDI & ORS. 539 [C.T. RAVIKUMAR, J.] copy of the sale deed No.1209/1928 dated 27.08.1928 of SRO Andipatti and its execution is not in dispute. It was marked through PW-1. Evidently, contentions, rather objections were raised on behalf of the respondent as to its admissibility in evidence and as per the impugned the objections were upheld by the High Court to certain extent on manifold reasons. It was contended before the High Court and upheld by the High Court that Ext.A1 is only a registration copy of sale deed No. 1209/1928 dated 27.08.1928 of SRO Andipatti, and its original title deed in the name of Puliyankaladi was not marked as an evidence. Further the High Court held that Puliyankaladi obtained the property as per Ext.A1 sale deed from sons of Vellaiya Thevar namely, Thavasi Thevar, Kuruppa Thevar, Subbaiah Thevar and Sangu Thevar but no document evincing partition conferring exclusive title on them to alienate the property was produced.
