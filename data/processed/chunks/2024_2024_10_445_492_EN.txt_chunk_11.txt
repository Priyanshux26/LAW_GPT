As has been said by the Supreme Court of America, “equal protection of laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws [Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 30 L Ed 220 : 118 US 356 at p. 369 (1886) : 1886 SCC OnLine US SC 188] ” (L Ed p. 226), and this means “subjection to equal laws applying alike to all in the same situation [Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, 54 L Ed 536 : 216 US 400 at p. 412 (1910) : 1910 SCC OnLine US SC 59] ” (L Ed p. 539). In other words, there should be no discrimination between one person and another if as regards the subject-matter of the legislation their position is the same. I am unable to accept the argument of Mr Chari that a legislation relating to one individual or one family or one body corporate would per se violate the guarantee of the equal protection rule. There can certainly be a law applying to one person or to one group of persons and it cannot be held to be unconstitutional if it is not discriminatory in its character [ Willis : Constitutional Law at p. 580.] . It would be bad law: “if it arbitrarily selects one individual or a class of individuals, one corporation or a class of corporations, and visits a penalty upon them which is not imposed upon others guilty of like delinquency [Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Co. v. Ellis, 41 L Ed 666 : 165 US 150 at 159 (1897) : 1897 SCC OnLine US SC 20] ….” (L Ed p. 669 : US p. 159) The legislature undoubtedly has a wide field of choice in determining and classifying the subject of its laws, and if the law deals alike with all of a certain class, it is normally not obnoxious to the charge of denial of equal protection; but the classification should never be arbitrary. It must always rest upon some real and substantial 462 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect to which the classification is made; and classification made without any substantial basis should be regarded as invalid [Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, 54 L Ed 536 : 216 US 400 at p. 412 (1910) : 1910 SCC OnLine US SC 59]. The question is whether judged by this test the impugned Act can be said to have contravened the provision embodied in Article 14 of the Constitution. Obviously, the Act purports to make provisions which are of a drastic character and against the general law of the land as laid down in the Indian Companies Act, in regard to the administration and management of the affairs of one Company in Indian territory. The Act itself gives no reason for the legislation but the Ordinance, which was a precursor of the Act, expressly stated why the legislation was necessary. It said that owing to mismanagement and neglect, a situation had arisen in the affairs of the Company which prejudicially affected the production of an essential commodity and caused serious unemployment amongst a certain section of the community.
