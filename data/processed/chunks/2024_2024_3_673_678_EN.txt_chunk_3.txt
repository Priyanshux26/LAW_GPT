While exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code the High Court has to be cautious. This power is to be used sparingly and only for the purpose of preventing abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure ends of justice. Whether a complaint discloses a criminal offence or not depends upon the nature of facts alleged therein. Whether essential ingredients of criminal offence are present or not has to be judged by the High Court. A complaint disclosing civil transactions may also have a criminal texture. But the High Court must see whether a dispute which is essentially of a civil nature is given a cloak of criminal offence. In such a situation, if a civil remedy is available and is, in fact, adopted as has happened in this case, the High Court should not hesitate to quash criminal proceedings to prevent abuse of process of court.” 17.

For the reasons stated above, the Impugned is set aside and the entire criminal proceedings arising out of the Subject FIR are quashed and set aside.

Pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Result of the case: Prastut Mahesh Dalvi, Hony. Associate Editor Appeal allowed. (Verified by: Liz Mathew, Sr. Adv.)
