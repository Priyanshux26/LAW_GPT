As per the Proposed Policy, the pay scale of 7500-12000 to the newly designated post of Block Education Officer would be notionally effective from 01.01.2006, with actual monetary benefits being given with effect from 01.12.2008. The restructuring, as proposed, would make available one Officer at the Tahsil / Block level to assist Basic Education Officers and District Inspector of Schools in carrying out their administrative and supervisory duties. Further, the Proposed Policy was made subject to the filing of an application and affidavit based on mutual consent of the parties. The High Court’s dated 06.05.2002 was to be 1330 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports accordingly modified to the above extent pursuant to a joint application of the parties in the pending appeal. 16. This Court, after noticing the cause of pay anomaly that occurred in the year 2001, referred to and relied upon the proposed Policy dated 12.01.2010 and eventually found no reason to interfere with the High Court’s judgement dated 06.05.2002 and dismissed the appeals vide the dated 08.12.2010, on the ground that the State itself had taken an appropriate decision to rectify the pay discrepancies and hence, no further cause as such survived requiring any further adjudication. This Court also noted the fact that no joint application based on mutual consent of the parties had been filed. This Court, in no uncertain terms, further directed that…. “the Government having taken appropriate decision cannot go back from implementing the same”. The operative part of the dated 08.12.2010 reads as follows:- “We do not find any error to have been committed by the High Court in issuing the impugned directions. However, there is no need to further dilate on this issue since the Government itself appears to have realised the anomaly in fixation of the pay scales as is evident from the proceedings dated 12th May, 2010 emanating from Secretary, Finance Department, Govt. of Uttar Pradesh and addressed to the Secretary, Basic Education Department, Govt. of Uttar Pradesh. The proceedings disclose that an appropriate decision has been taken to rectify the pay discrepancies in respect of the post of Deputy Inspector of Schools/Deputy Basic Education Officer of the Department of Education on the recommendations of the Pay Committee (2008). The operative portion of the said proceedings reads as under:- “According to the above as a result of cadre constitution getting sanctioned imaginary the pay scale of Rs. 7500-12000/- from 01.01.2006 for the post of Block Education Officer, the real benefit be given from 01.12.2008.” By the same proceedings, a decision was taken to file the same into this Court together with application supported by an affidavit in as much as such decision was taken with [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1331 State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr. v. Virendra Bahadur Katheria and Ors. mutual consent of the parties. But for whatever reason, the same has not been filed into the Court. Since the Government itself has taken appropriate decision in the matter as is evident from the proceedings referred to hereinabove, no further cause as such survives requiring any further adjudication of this appeal and the Government having taken appropriate decision cannot go back from implementing the same.
