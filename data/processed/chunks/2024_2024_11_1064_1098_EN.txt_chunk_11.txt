(viii) That the right to be heard as provided under Section 5-A of the Act is in the nature of a fundamental right and the same cannot be dispensed with, so as to justify the lackadaisical approach of the State Government. It was also contended that Section 19 [2010] 9 SCR 133 : (2010) 11 SCC 242 1082 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 5-A is not to be superseded ipso facto even if the provisions of Sections 17(1) and 17(2) of the Act are being invoked. Reliance in support of this contention was placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of Dev Sharan v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others,20 wherein it was held that even in cases of ‘urgency’ or ‘unforeseen emergency’, enquiry contemplated by Section 5-A cannot ipso facto be dispensed with and even if the case is covered under sub-sections (1) or (2) of Section 17, sub-Section (4) of Section 17 would not necessarily apply. The relevant extracts relied upon are as below:- “32. In a recent of this Court in Essco Fabs, (2009) 2 SCC 377, this Court, after considering previous s as also the provisions of Section 17 of the Act held: (SCC P. 839, para 41) “41. Whereas sub-section (1) of Section 17 deals with cases of ‘urgency’, sub-section (2) of the said section covers cases of ‘sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency’. But even in such cases i.e. cases of ‘urgency’ or ‘unforeseen emergency’, enquiry contemplated by Section 5-A cannot ipso facto be dispensed with which is clear from sub-section (4) of Section 17 of the Act.” This Court, therefore, held that once a case is covered under sub-section (1) or (2) of Section 17, sub- section (4) of Section 17 would not necessarily apply: (SCC P. 395, para 54) “54. In our opinion, therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent authorities is not well founded and cannot be upheld that once a case is covered by sub- sections (1) or (2) of Section 17 of the Act, sub-section (4) of Section 17 would necessarily apply and there is no question of holding inquiry 20 (2011) 4 SCC 769 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1083 Kali Charan and Others v. State of U.P. and Others or hearing objections under Section 5-A of the Act. Acceptance of such contention or upholding of this argument will make sub-section (4) of Section 17 totally otiose, redundant and nugatory.” (ix) That the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court committed grave error in law while placing reliance upon the of Nand Kishore, for denying relief to the landowners. That on a conjoint reading of paras 3 and 96 of Nand Kishore, it would become evident that the land in question therein admeasured 1604 Hectares, which was to be acquired for the construction of the Yamuna Expressway itself and it is in that background that the invocation of the urgency clause was upheld, whereas the question as to the invocation of urgency clause to acquire land for commercial, residential or industrial purpose was not posed for adjudication in Nand Kishore,although it held the acquisition to be for public purpose.
