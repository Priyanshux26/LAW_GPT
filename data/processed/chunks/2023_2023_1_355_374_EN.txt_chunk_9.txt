Plot E No. 13144 within the identified land by the plttff. The area under C.S. Plot No. 13144 is 1 Kani 3 gandas only. Whereas the “Ekrarnama” was created for 1 Kani 5 gandas 2 Karas 2 Krantas only. xx xx xx” F The trial court, in our opinion, has wrongly held that the Survey Report (Exhibit - I) supports and accepts the case of the plaintiff. The said finding was factually incorrect. The High Court has rightly held that the Survey Report (Exhibit - I) is against the plea and contention of the plaintiff. As per the Survey Report (Exhibit-I) quoted above, the description of the Schedule ‘A’ property, where the building Hotel Khosh G Mahal is located is different from the description given in the schedule of the Deed of Patta (Exhibit-12) and Ekrarnama (Exhibit-5). The description of the land and identification in the Patta (Exhibit - A) in favour of M/s. Hotel Khush Mahal Limited is as under: H 368 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A “ PATTA (Executed on 11-10-1358 T.E.) (= 1948 A.D.) xx xx xx B This deed of PATTA of Taksishi Taluk within the territory of independent Tripura, under Sadar Sub Registry and Police-Station appertaining to Agartala Nutan Haveli town, land measuring 3 Kani 8 Gandas 3 Karas 16 ½ Dhurs, measured in 8 Cubit length ‘Nal’ (Chain) = 12 x 10 (‘Nal’) is executed in favour of HOTEL KHOSH MAHAL LIMITED on a Lease for 20 (Twenty) years C from 1349 T.E. to 1369 T.E. xx xx xx DESCRIPTION OF THE LAND Land situated in Natun Haveli Town, bounded as follows:- D In the North- ‘Khas Land’ to the South of Smriti-Mandir.

Thirdly, post the submission of the Survey Report (Exhibit-I), the plaintiff in 1995 had amended the plaint and post the amendment, G had increased the measurements mentioned in Schedule ‘A’ from 1 Kani 5 Gandas 2 Karas, 3 Krantas and 10 Dhurs, to 2 Kanis 8 Gandas 3 Karas and 8½ Dhurs. Consequent to this amendment, the figures now recorded in Schedule ‘A’ corresponded with the measurements mentioned in the Deed of Patta (Exhibit-A), which patta was executed in 1948 in favour of M/s. Hotel Khosh Mahal Limited. The trial court in the H SMRITI DEBBARMA (DEAD) THROUGH LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE 369 v. PRABHA RANJAN DEBBARMA [SANJIV KHANNA, J.] impugned has overlooked this discrepancy by observing that A the quantity of land was immaterial as the basic dispute is whether the Schedule ‘A’ property belonged to the plaintiff or to M/s. Hotel Khosh Mahal Limited. The trial court, in support, observed that earlier land was measured by eye estimation and the quantity of land in actual possession would always be in excess of what is written in the instrument.
