Immediately as the condition was sought to be C imposed, the Writ Petition was filed in the year 1995. At best, Rule 19 can be only a Statutory /Notification/ Guideline and it cannot be considered more than a Subordinate Legislation. Relying on the principles laid down for impugning Subordinate Legislation in State of Tamil Nadu v. P. Krishnamurthy2, it is contended that the Rule, Rule 19(b)(2)(vi)(c) D violates Sections 36 to 39. Harmoniously reading Section 17 and Section 20 and Sections 36 to 39 of the Act, would establish that the reserved lands (made for open spaces) under Section 17(2)(k) and Section 20(1)(k), should be acquired within three years, failing which, the lands shall get reverted to the owner. In the case of regulating the use of lands, such as putting restrictions on the use of land under Section 17(2)(l) and Section E 20(1)(n), within the planning area, do not call for compensation. Section 17(2)(b), as also Sections 21(1)(k) and (n) relating to detailed development plans, are the only provisions dealing with the open spaces. Proviso to Section 39(1) require the respondents to pay compensation for all items, except the matters that fall under Section 17(2)(l) and Section 20(n), F again, both of which are regulatory. Sections 48, 49 and 52 to 54 are projected to contend that the object of the Act is to regulate the development and not to deprive land. Sections 52 to 54 also mandate, payment of compensation. Exceptions to the ’Pay compensation’ principle, involve cases, where there is no mandate to reserve land for public purposes. There is no power, as claimed under Sections 9C, 17, G 20 and 35 or Section 124, to make the impugned Rule. It is further contended that the impugned Rule contravenes and is inconsistent with the Sections 6(2), 12 and 18 of the Tamil Nadu Apartment Ownership Act, 1994 and, hence, is void. The appellant, having developed two blocks, 2 (2006) 4 SCC 517 H 1046 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A the developed building comes under the said 1994 Act. It applies to apartments constructed prior to its commencement. The impugned Rule, being inconsistent with Sections 6(2), 12, 18, 25 and 26 of the Act had become inoperative. The impugned Rule is alleged to be violative of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and hence, void, in view of Article 254(2) of the Constitution. It is sought to be contended that since Entry 42 of the B Concurrent List provides for acquisition and requisition, any State Legislature, seeking to put in place, a law to acquire lands with lesser compensation, it would be impermissible. It would be discriminatory. The Act took care to incorporate Land Acquisition Act by reference under Section 36 of the Act. This meant that depravation of property, C without compensation, was not contemplated. Sections 36 and 37 are invoked. Even the State Legislature has no power to seek transfer of lands to the State free-of-cost. Even a single owner could construct a luxury independent bungalow with 3000 square meters and he will not be required to spare any land to society whereas 184 owners who constructed 184 flats with each family having 59.7 square meters would D have to spare 10 per cent of their land free-of-cost.
