The Trial Court passed on security after two years, viz., on 29.03.2015 with the expression ‘inappropriate security’. The Trial Court had to give direction on sufficiency of security within the prescribed period. If that had been B passed and the Trial Court raises questions about sufficiency of the security, the appellants could not have submitted other security or cash without the of the Court. Reliance is placed on the dated 03.12.2015 passed by the High Court. In view of the passed by the High Court, in the hierarchical system, the ADJ erred in overlooking the of the High Court. We are reminded that the of the C ADJ dated 01.08.2017 was also challenged before the High Court in the Writ Petition. The merits of the case must be considered. THE SUBMISSIONS OF RESPONDENTS 1 TO 6 14. The requirements under Section 17 are mandatory. Security D was not filed on 06.05.2014 but on 24.05.2014. Therefore, the mandatory condition in proviso to Section 17(1) was not complied with.The Court should have passed an on the Application under Section 17(8C) dated 06.05.2014 indicating the nature of the security, that would be sufficient for the performance of the Decree. However, it was contended that it is not forthcoming as to why appellants did not press the Application E under Section 17 dated 06.05.2014 and also filed other Application for security. Therefore, the failure on the part of the Court to pass s on the Application dated 06.05.2014 under Section 17 could not be a factor entitling appellants to contend that in the absence of an , they were prejudiced. This is for the reason that they are presumed to F know, having regard to Section 17(2) of the Act, that security must be such as may be enforceable in law. The security, which was furnished, consisted of a shop room, which belonged to the Municipal Corporation and not to Shri Abhishek Dixit (the surety) who was the third Writ Petitioner and who is shown as Proforma Respondent No.7 in the Appeal. The security was not enforceable. The period of limitation for providing G security had expired. While an Application under Section 17 can be filed with application under IX Rule 13, the security must be filed along with the Application. Otherwise, it may not be possible for the Court to find whether the security, which was filed, was in conformity of the 2(1983) 4 SCC 1 H 742 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A Section 17(2) of the Act. Even assuming that the security could be furnished subsequently, the subsequently furnished security was not enforceable in law. The Application under IX Rule 13 has not been rejected on the ground that security was not furnished but on the ground that the security furnished on 12.05.2014 (Application 14C) was not a valid security. Therefore, the plea that the appellants cannot suffer B on account of the fault of the Court, does not arise. ANALYSIS; 3 DECISIONS;KEDARNATH (SUPRA) 15. We have already set out Section 17 of the Act.
