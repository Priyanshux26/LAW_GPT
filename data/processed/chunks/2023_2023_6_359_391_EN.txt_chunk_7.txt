When the concurrent findings of the courts below are the outcome of the rightful consideration and appreciation of materials on record they do not call for any interference. Taking into account the fact that the suit was indisputably filed based on prior permission and illegal dispossession there is no reason to place D sale deed executed (even if by the owners) in favour of the deceased second appellant to displace the concurrent findings of the courts below on the entitlement of the respondent/the plaintiff for a decree as granted by the trial court and confirmed by the High Court.
