E (xi) It is submitted that when section 153A requires assessment of ‘total income’, can it be interpreted so as to exclude a part of the ‘total income’ while making the assessment? It is submitted that if income based on incriminating material from sources other than the search is excluded from assessment under section 153A, how can the same be brought to tax? It is submitted that the F language and meaning of Section 153A is plain and unambiguous, i.e., if search under section 132 of the Act, 1961 is conducted in a case, assessment of ‘total income’ for each of the six assessment years pending the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which such search is conducted, has to be made. It is submitted G that therefore the decision of the Special Bench of the Tribunal in the case of All Cargo Global Logistics Ltd. v. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, (2012) 18 ITR (Trib.) 106 (ITAT/Mum) dated 06.07.2012 and the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax, Central-III v. Kabul Chawla, (2015) 61 taxmann.com 412 H PRINCIPAL COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, CENTRAL-3 917 v. ABHISAR BUILDWELL P. LTD. [M. R. SHAH, J.] (Delhi) dated 28.08.2015 are not in consonance with the plain A language and meaning of Section 153A and in the process, defeats the very purpose of the ‘charging section’ of the Act. 4. Learned counsel appearing for the respective assessees have made the following submissions: B i) It is submitted that the core issue that arises in the present set of appeals is, as to whether in respect of completed assessments/unabated assessments, whether the jurisdiction of assessing officer to make assessment is confined to incriminating material found during the course of search under Section 132 of the Act or not, i.e., whether any addition can be C made by the assessing officer in absence of any incriminating material found during the course of search under section 132 of the Act, 1961 or not. ii) It is submitted that it is the case on behalf of the Revenue that the jurisdiction to assess the total income under section D 153A arises upon ‘search’ under section 132 and that the jurisdiction is not contingent upon unearthing incriminating material during the course of search. To the aforesaid, it is submitted that while the jurisdiction to issue notice under section 153A may arise consequent to search, however, jurisdiction to E assess or reassess the income cannot be assumed merely on the basis of ‘search’ particularly when no incriminating material is unearthed during the course of search. It is submitted that the assessment under section 153A is not the same as regular assessment under section 143(3) as is being contested by the Revenue. It is submitted that under the scheme of the Act, F 1961, there are different provisions to make assessment, namely, (1) regular assessment under section 143(3); (2) best assessment under section 144; (3) reassessment in case of income having escaped assessment under section 147; and (4) assessment under section 153A in consequence of search under G section 132. iii) It is submitted that the assessment under section 153A is a special procedure for assessment in consequence of search and is distinct from regular scrutiny assessment under section 143(3) or reassessment under section 147 of the Act, 1961.
