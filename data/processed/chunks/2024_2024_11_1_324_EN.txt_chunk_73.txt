(2010) 7 SCC 1 : 2010 INSC 290 91 In Re Natural Resources Allocation (2012) 10 SCC 1, 100 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 80. Mr Tushar Mehta, the learned Solicitor General, supplemented the arguments of the learned Attorney General. He argued: a. The interpretation that Article 39(b) includes privately owned resources, has been a consistent position of this Court and has acquired the status of stare decisis. The opinion of Justice Krishna Iyer in Ranganatha Reddy has been followed in Sanjeev Coke, State of Tamil Nadu & Ors vs. L. Abu Kavur Bai & Ors.,92 and also by a bench of eleven judges in Mafatlal Industries. There is no conflict of opinion between different judgements; b. The observations in Mafatlal Industries on the interpretation of Article 39(b) do not constitute obiter dicta. The interpretation of Article 39(b) is discussed by three opinions in the decision, including the dissenting opinion and the issue was specifically argued; c. The meaning of the phrase “material resources of the community” cannot be whittled down to only include public resources and exclude private property. The phrase specifically uses the word ‘community’ to include the resources of every individual; d. The inclusion of the phrase “securing that the ownership and control” in Article 39(b) indicates that the phrase that follows it i.e. “material resources of the community” includes resources which are not public resources. The ‘ownership and control’ of public resources would not be required to be secured and it is only private property that is required to be “secured” for the purposes of ownership and control; e. The terms ‘ownership’ and ‘control’ are disjunctive and there may be situations where the state does not acquire ownership but only acquires control. For instance, if a mineral is found on private land, the ownership may remain with the private person, but control over the mineral and the land is taken over by the government. Therefore, the term ‘and’ must be read as ‘and/or’; 92 [1984] 1 SCR 725 : (1984) 1 SCC 515 : 1984 INSC 17 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 101 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors.
