Thus, IMDT Case No.692/05 was registered before the then IMD Tribunal, Nalbari. The same case was re-registered under the 1964 as F.T. (Nal) Case No. (N)1096/06 upon the IMDT Act being declared unconstitutional by this Court in Sarbananda Sonowal I (supra) on 12.07.2005. 30. Consequently, the notice issued under Section 8(1), IMDT Act became a nullity and therefore F.T. (Nal) Case No. (N) 1096/06 was started and a reference was made to the Tribunal. The Tribunal answered the reference by dated 19.03.2012 as under: “This is a reference u/s 2(1) of the Foreigner’s Tribunal () 1964 for opinion whether O.P. Md.
