H BHASIN INFOTECH AND INFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATE LTD. 1077 v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] 6.1. In the impugned dated 24.01.2022, it was reasoned that A the policy came into existence for the first time in the year 2013 and theme-based malls were included in the year 2016, whereas the allotment of the subject land was made on 05.08.2006; the subject land was given under the lease deed for a period of 90 years; and partial completion certificate was issued on 07.05.2011. Thus, developers and buyers were B aware about land being taken on lease and investment had been made in those terms. Further, the planning and construction of plot had not been under the provisions of policy in question. 6.2. In continuation, it was also reasoned that there was no participation of any State Government PSU/SPV as required in the C relevant clauses of the amended policy; the land could be made freehold as per rules after its acquisition by executing agency only if there was minimum 20% participation of any PSU/SPV of the State Government. It was also observed that as per the terms of allotment, conditions of regulating authority would be applicable and there was no provision in the existing policies of respondent No. 2 to give developed land for D freehold. 6.3. While rejecting the contention of the petitioner that theme park/amusement park could be established by any private sector, PPP or any authority creating SPV, it was held that its assessment, selection and implementation is subject to the decision of authority concerned E under its own rules; and since there was no policy of the authority concerned for giving the land as freehold, the request was liable to be rejected. 6.4. In relation to the other contention that respondent No. 2 should allow execution of bipartite sub-lease if the land was not made freehold F in absence of any condition of tripartite sub-lease in the lease deed dated 23.08.2006, it was observed that although, the said lease deed did not explicitly mention the execution of tripartite sub-lease but, the allotment letter did so and point No. 13 of the said lease deed also made it clear that the allottees have to abide by general terms and conditions of G allotment. In addition, it was also observed that the other lease deed dated 30.03.2009 explicitly mentioned such a condition and the integrated map of both parcels of land for total area of 40505 sq. mtrs. was approved on 08.10.2009. It was also observed that since the question as to the execution of tripartite sub-lease was sub judice before the High Court, it was not proper to take any final decision in that regard.
