The complainant was given liberty to withdraw the 1 High Court 2 CRM-M-25041-2024 3 Cr. PC 4 N. I. Act 5 trial magistrate 6 Sessions Court 1278 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports deposit subject to furnishing an undertaking that the same would be returned, if the appellants succeeded in the appeal. 6. Imposition of such condition by the Sessions Court for deposit of 20% of the compensation awarded by the trial magistrate was questioned by the appellants before the High Court in a petition7 filed under Section 482, Cr. PC. 7. The said petition was considered by the High Court on 01st May, 2023, i.e., at a point of time when the decision of this Court in Surinder Singh Deswal @ Col. S. S. Deswal vs Virender Gandhi8 was governing the field on interpretation of Section 148 of the N.I. Act. The said decision held the condition for deposit in terms of Section 148, N.I. Act as mandatory. 8. Learned counsel appearing for the appellants had argued for some time. However, having found that his arguments would yield no fruitful result since the High Court was bound by the ratio of the decision in Surinder Singh Deswal (supra), he made a statement that the appellants would withdraw the petition. Accordingly, an was passed to the effect that the petition stands dismissed as withdrawn. 9. Close on the heels of dismissal of the said petition of the appellants, as withdrawn, came the decision of another coordinate bench of this Court in Jamboo Bhandari v. Madhya Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. and ors.9. Upon consideration of the law laid down in Surinder Singh Deswal (supra), the bench in Jamboo Bhandari (supra) proceeded to hold as follows: - “6. What is held by this Court is that a purposive interpretation should be made of Section 148 of the NI Act. Hence, normally, Appellate Court will be justified in imposing the condition of deposit as provided in Section 148. However, in a case where the Appellate Court is satisfied that the condition of deposit of 20% will be unjust or imposing such a condition will amount to deprivation of the right of appeal of the appellant, exception can be made for the reasons specifically recorded. 7 CRM-M-21715-2023 8 [2019] 8 SCR 746 : 2019 (11) SCC 341 9 (2023) 10 SCC 446 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1279 Muskan Enterprises & Anr. v. The State of Punjab & Anr. 7. Therefore, when Appellate Court considers the prayer under Section 389 of the Cr. P.C. of an accused who has been convicted for offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, it is always open for the Appellate Court to consider whether it is an exceptional case which warrants grant of suspension of sentence without imposing the condition of deposit of 20% of the fine/compensation amount. As stated earlier, if the Appellate Court comes to the conclusion that it is an exceptional case, the reasons for coming to the said conclusion must be recorded.” 10.
