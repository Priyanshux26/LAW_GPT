The state, however, omitted to provide any mechanism to determine how E the exemption limits could be worked out for the purpose of notional calculation of the quantified limit. This meant that a reasonable workable method of calculation had to be applied. [Para 14][125-B-D] 1.4 The state’s contention is founded on the assumption that the amount collected during the exemption period by the F multiplex owners, also included in element of tax. This assumption is flawed because there could have been no collection which amounted to tax. Furthermore, multiplex/theatre-owners were under an obligation to file monthly returns in terms of the enactment. This would have taken care of any allegation of abuse. G The state’s additional argument was that since the element of tax was notionally included in the collections – by multiplexes, - during the exempted period, a further amount equivalent to the tax collectable had to be added. High Court rightly held that this contention was illogical and unreasonable. [Para 15-16][125-D- F] H 114 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A 1.5 There is concededly, a gap in the manner how tax exemption limits can be discerned. The law is now settled (by two constitution bench decisions) that exemption notifications have to be interpreted strictly, and against assessees in case of ambiguity. [Para 16][125-F-G] B Commissioner of Central Excise, New Delhi v. Hari Chand Shri Gopal [2010] 13 SCR 820: (2011) 1 SCC 236;Commissioner of Customs (Import), Mumbai v. Dilip Kumar and Company & Ors. [2018] 7 SCR 1191: (2018) 9 SCC 1 – followed. C 1.6 In the present case, the situation is peculiar, because the grant of exemption, and the terms of such relief (in terms of time, and monetary limits) are unambiguous. However, the procedure for calculation of the monetary limit is not prescribed at all. Therefore, the present case is not one of ambiguity, but instead, one of a clear gap, which if not construed appropriately, D would defeat the intention of the notification. It has often been held – in the context of rules of procedures that they are meant to facilitate, not supplant justice and the court must lean towards substantial justice when faced with a complaint of procedural law. [Para 17-20][125-D-E; 127-D-E] E Sangram Singh v. Election Tribunal, Kotah & Anr. [1955] 2 SCR 1; Ghanshyam Dass v. Dominion of India [1984] 3 SCR 229: (1984) 3 SCC 64; Sugandhi v. P. Rajkumar (2020) 10 SCC 706 – relied on. 1.7 A reasonable method of calculating benefit of tax F exemption, for the purpose of considering whether the 100% limit equivalent to capital expenditure was reached or not is to notionally determine the tax amounts payable during the relevant period, when the multiplexes enjoyed tax exemption. This is possible, having regard to the returns filed by them during the time when they sought and were granted exemption. The outer G limit (100% investment) is a discernible amount, which the units would be able to furnish, with appropriate proof in their books of accounts, and valuations furnished by them.
