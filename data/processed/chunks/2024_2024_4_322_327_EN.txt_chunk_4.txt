The Trial Court gives several reasons for discarding the testimony of PW-4. His prior enmity with the appellants and his failure to report the incident to the police, notwithstanding available opportunities, are also the factors considered by the Trial Court. 10. Therefore, after having perused the evidence of the material prosecution witnesses, in our view, the finding of the Trial Court that the evidence of PW-4 did not inspire confidence is a possible finding which could have been recorded on the basis of the evidence on record. There was no reason for the High Court to overturn the of acquittal when the findings of the Trial Court were possible findings that could be arrived at after reappreciating evidence. 11. Therefore, the appeal must succeed. We set aside the and dated 14th December 2018 of the High Court and set aside the conviction of the appellants. The and dated 5th July 1997 of the Trial Court is restored. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed. The bail bonds of the appellant no.2 are cancelled. The appellant no.1 shall be forthwith set at liberty unless he is required to be detained in connection with any other case. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeal allowed.
