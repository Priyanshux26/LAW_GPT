13. Conclusion: After considering the learned counsels’ submissions in light of the above findings of the APTEL, we find that no substantial question of law arises in the present case. The APTEL has primarily decided a question of fact as to the attributability of the delay, and from the above, it is clear that the APTEL’s findings are neither illegal nor unreasonable. Hence, we find no reason to interfere with the same. 14. Lastly, we also reject the appellant’s contention that the APTEL’s direction to pay late payment surcharge to the respondents is unjustified since the same was not pleaded. As we have already held, the APTEL rightly restored the tariff of Rs. 8.4 per unit and directed the appellant to pay the difference amount. The direction to pay the late payment surcharge on this amount is explicitly rooted in the PPA, and hence, is in furtherance of the intention of the parties. There is no reason to set aside the same. 15. With the above reasons, we dismiss the present appeals. 16. No as to costs. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
