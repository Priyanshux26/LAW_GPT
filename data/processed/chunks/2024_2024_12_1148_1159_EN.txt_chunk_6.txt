23. The Government’s ability to function effectively hinges on its capacity to deploy adequate human resources. The unfilled vacancies have a cascading effect on governance and public service. The KPSC’s refusal to expand the rank list exacerbates these challenges, creating unnecessary bottlenecks in the recruitment process. The KPSC’s actions, in this case, are not only contrary to the Government’s directives but also detrimental to the broader public interest. 24. The appellants before this Court have waited for nearly a decade for the completion of the selection process. They stand to suffer irreparable harm if the rank list is not expanded to include them. The Government’s directive to select additional candidates under the same notification does not prejudice other aspirants, particularly since the next selection process has not yet commenced. On the contrary, it serves to mitigate the inequities caused by the prolonged recruitment process. 25. The principle of equity demands that the appellants’ grievances be addressed in a manner that balances individual rights with administrative exigencies. Denying them the opportunity to be considered for the additional vacancies under the 2014 notification would amount to a grave injustice. 26. The High Court’s failed to account for the unique circumstances of this case, including the duplication of names in multiple select lists and the resulting unfilled vacancies. It also overlooked the binding nature of the Tribunal’s dated 28.11.2022, which expressly recognized the extraordinary situation and directed appropriate remedial action. This oversight has further compounded the hardships faced by the appellants. 27. Moreover, the High Court did not adequately address the implications of the Government’s role in notifying vacancies and directing the expansion of the rank list. By failing to engage with these critical issues, the High Court’s does not reflect a comprehensive understanding of the factual and administrative complexities involved. 28. The Government’s directives regarding workforce requirements are binding on the KPSC, provided they do not interfere with the integrity and sanctity of the selection process. While the KPSC’s autonomy 1158 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports remains vital, it must be exercised within the confines of its role as a facilitator of recruitment and not as an arbiter of administrative policy. 29. We would further like to emphasise that the appellants in this case are successful and meritorious candidates who have duly qualified the selection process and secured their rightful place in the rank list. They are not individuals who failed to meet the required standards or are seeking selection through an unwarranted expansion of the rank list. Instead, these candidates have endured a prolonged wait due to administrative lapses, including the overlapping of names across multiple rank lists and the inadequate notification of vacancies. Such anomalies in the recruitment process have unfairly deprived deserving candidates of their rightful opportunities. Such administrative anomalies should not prejudice deserving candidates. Denying them the opportunity to be considered for unfilled vacancies disregards their merit and undermines the integrity of the selection process. It is imperative to ensure that such candidates are not penalized for circumstances beyond their control, as doing so would contradict the principles of fairness and equity inherent in public employment.
