On a reference made, the third learned Judge, Justice C.V. Kartikeyan extended his concurrence with Justice D. Bharata Chakravarty: “(i) Whether Enforcement Directorate has the power to seek custody of a person arrested? The answer given by this Court is ‘Yes’ in alignment with the views/opinion expressed by the Hon’ble Justice Mr. D. Bharatha Chakravarthy. (ii) Whether the Habeas Corpus Petition itself is maintainable after a judicial of remand is passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction? V. SENTHIL BALAJI v. THE STATE REPRESENTED BY 865 DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] The Petition would be maintainable in exceptional circumstances, but this case does not attract any exceptional circumstance and consequently since an of remand had been passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction, the relief sought in the petition cannot be granted. I would align with the view expressed by the Hon’ble Justice Mr. D. Bharatha Chakravarthy, with respect to this issue. (iii) The consequential issue is as to whether Enforcement Directorate would be entitled to seek exclusion of time for the period of hospitalization beyond the fi rst 15 days from the date of initial remand.” 19. However, the learned Judge sent the fi le back to the Division Bench to adjudicate upon the date of custody to be reckoned followed by the actual days that might be required. Aggrieved, the appellant and his wife fi led Special Leave Petition (Criminal) Nos. 8939-8940 of 2023 and Special Leave Petition (Criminal) Nos. 8652-8653 of 2023 respectively. With the limited grievance over the fi le being sent back by the third learned Judge, the respondents fi led Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 8750 of 2023. Two more Special Leave Petitions have been fi led by respondents being Special Leave Petition (Criminal) Nos. 7437 of 2023 and 7460 of 2023, challenging the interim of the High Court and the conditions imposed by the learned Principal Sessions Judge while granting remand and for the exclusion of 15 days. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT: 20. We have had the pleasure of hearing Shri Kapil Sibal and Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocates appearing on behalf of the appellant, at length. We would like to summarise their submissions in a nutshell together. 21. There is no power vested under the PMLA, 2002 to seek custody in favour of an authorized offi cer. Such an authorized offi cer is not a police offi cer and therefore, Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as “the CrPC, 1973”), with particular reference to a remand in his favour, is not available. Custody under Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 can only be in favour of a police offi cer and not any other agency. There is no investigation under the PMLA, 2002 since it is to be 866 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. taken as synonymous with inquiry. After the completion of 24 hours from the arrest, there cannot be further custody in favour of an offi cer. Being a benefi cial legislation, non-compliance of Section 41A of the CrPC, 1973 would vitiate the s of remand.
