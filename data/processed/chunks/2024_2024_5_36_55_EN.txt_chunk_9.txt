Acid attacks not only cause damage to the physical appearance of its victims but also cause immense psychological trauma thereby becoming a hurdle in their overall development. Although we have acknowledged the seriousness of the acid attack when we amended our laws in 2013 [ The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 (13 of 2013).] , yet the number of acid attacks are on the rise. Moreover, this Court has been passing various s to restrict the availability of corrosive substance in the market which is an effort to nip this social evil in the bud. [Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India, (2016) 3 SCC 571 : (2016) 2 SCC (Cri) 143] It must be recognised that having stringent laws and enforcement agencies may not be sufficient unless deep- rooted gender bias is removed from the society.” 11. In another case reported as State of Himachal Pradesh and Another vs Vijay Kumar alias Pappu and Another5 regarding acid attack on a young girl of 19 years, in which this Court observed in paragraph 13 thereof, that the victim had suffered 16% burn injuries and that 4 [2017] 13 SCR 1 : (2017) 16 SCC 466 : 2017 INSC 1296 5 (2019) 5 SCC 373 : 2019 INSC 377 50 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports such a victim cannot be compensated by grant of any compensation. Paragraph 13 is thereof extracted below: “13. Indeed, it cannot be ruled out that in the present case the victim had suffered an uncivilised and heartless crime committed by the respondents and there is no room for leniency which can be conceived. A crime of this nature does not deserve any kind of clemency. This Court cannot be oblivious of the situation that the victim must have suffered an emotional distress which cannot be compensated either by sentencing the accused or by grant of any compensation.” 12. The circumstances under which a bail granted by the court below can be cancelled, having been summarised by this Court in Deepak Yadav vs State of Uttar Pradesh and Another6. Relevant paragraphs 31 to 35 are extracted below: “C. Cancellation of bail 31. This Court has reiterated in several instances that bail once granted, should not be cancelled in a mechanical manner without considering whether any supervening circumstances have rendered it no longer conducive to a fair trial to allow the accused to retain his freedom by enjoying the concession of bail during trial. Having said that, in case of cancellation of bail, very cogent and overwhelming circumstances are necessary for an directing cancellation of bail (which was already granted). 32. A two-Judge Bench of this Court in Dolat Ram v. State of Haryana [Dolat Ram v. State of Haryana, (1995) 1 SCC 349 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 237] laid down the grounds for cancellation of bail which are: (i) interference or attempt to interfere with the due course of administration of justice; (ii) evasion or attempt to evade the due course of justice; 6 [2022] 4 SCR 1 : (2022) 8 SCC 559 : 2022 INSC 610 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
