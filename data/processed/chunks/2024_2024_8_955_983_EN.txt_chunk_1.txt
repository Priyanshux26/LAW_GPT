[Paras 27, 32, 34, 37, 45, 49] Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.45 – Twin conditions under, discussed – Scope of enquiry – “reasonable grounds for believing” – Meaning: Held: Court while dealing with the application for grant of bail in PMLA need not delve deep into the merits of the case and only a view of the Court based on the available material available on record is required – The words used in Section 45 are “reasonable grounds for believing” which means that the Court has to see only if there is a genuine case against the accused and the prosecution is not required to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt. [Para 13] Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Bail application – Counter/response in the original Court – Significance: Held: In cases where the Public Prosecutor takes a considered decision to oppose the bail application, the counter affidavit of the Investigating Agency should make out a cogent case specifically crystallizing albeit briefly the material sought to be relied upon to establish prima facie the three foundational facts in the given case to help the Court at the bail application stage to arrive at a conclusion within the framework laid down in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary case – It is only thereafter the presumption under Section 24 would arise and the burden would shift on the accused.
