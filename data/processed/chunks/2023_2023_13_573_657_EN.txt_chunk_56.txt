On 30.04.2015, the assessee fi led a declaration eff ective from 01.05.2015, declaring the product as Jarda, and on the same day separate rates for ‘Jarda scented tobacco’ and ‘chewing tobacco’ were notifi ed having a vast diff erence with respect to the duty leviable on ‘chewing tobacco’. The Assistant Commissioner confi rmed the duty on ‘Jarda/Zarda scented tobacco’ and thereafter the assessee vide communication dated 12.05.2015 sought to correct its declaration and intended to shift the product to tariff heading CET SH 2403 9910 (chewing tobacco) instead of CET SH 2403 9930 i.e., ‘jarda/zarda scented tobacco’. The Assistant Commissioner by communication dated 18.05.2015 rejected the request and by communication dated 20.05.2015 called upon the assessee to furnish a complete list of all ingredients used for the manufacturing of the product with write-up and fl ow chart duly certifi ed. The assessee paid the duty under protest for the month of May 2015 though he has fi led a revised declaration. The Assistant Commissioner vide dated 02.06.2015 rejected the proposed change in classifi cation and raised the demand for the months of June 2015 to September 2015 and this was confi rmed by the appellate authority on 12.01.2016. A separate show cause notice dated 04.05.2016 was issued claiming diff erential duty on May 2015 which was confi rmed vide dated 16.03.2017 and the appellate tribunal set aside both the s, namely, dated 12.01.2016 and 16.03.2017. The assessee’s attempt to contend that what was manufactured by it was ‘chewing tobacco’ by relying upon the sale invoices before the tribunal was successful and it was held that the product manufactured by the petitioner was ‘chewing tobacco’. Hence, the Revenue is in appeal. SUBMISSIONS OF PARTIES 125. Ms. Nisha Bagchi, learned standing counsel for the Revenue, would contend that post facto declaration by the assessee would not be valid COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. AHMEDABAD v. M/S URMIN 649 PRODUCTS P. LTD. AND OTHERS [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] in view of Rule 6,7,9 of CTPM Rules. She would contend that the assessee in its declaration had clearly declared the product in manufactured by it as, zarda scented tobacco, based on which the duty would be payable. The tribunal committed an error in proceeding on the basis that it is the case of the Revenue that assessee had manufactured Zarda by showing the same as CT though the assessee itself had declared manufacturing of zarda product. She would submit that the statutory provisions do not provide any defi nition of the two competing terms and the goods would be classifi ed as per general commercial parlance. She would further contend that the assessee had failed to demonstrate cogent evidence, that it manufactured chewing tobacco during the relevant period. Hence, she prays for the appeal being allowed. 126. The learning counsel appearing for the assessee would rely upon the registration form submitted to the department whereunder the list of ingredients used in the manufacture of the product had been specifi ed and nowhere it is stated that scent was being used for the product and as such the department ought to have rebutted the ingredients furnished by the assessee.
