There is no reason why after all these years they should 202 [1984] 1 SCR 594 : (1984) 1 SCC 222 203 [1984] 1 SCR 594 : (1984) 1 SCC 222 [22] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1305 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 not be brought at par with other landlords who are subject to the restrictions imposed by the Act in the matter of eviction of tenants and control of rents. (emphasis supplied) 113. In Rattan Arya v. State of Tamil Nadu,204 the issue for the consideration of a three-Judge Bench of this Court was whether Section 30(ii) of the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act 1960 is constitutionally valid. Section 30(ii) exempted the application of the Act to any residential building occupied by any tenant if the monthly rent was higher than Rupees Four Hundred. Relying on Motor General Traders (supra), this Court held that the provision was unconstitutional because the justification for imposing a ceiling of Rupees Four Hundred in 1973 had become unreal upon the passage of time because of the multi-fold increase in residential rents.205 The premise of the principle of temporal unreasonableness is that a classification which was reasonable when the law was enacted could become unreasonable over the course of time. Due to the change in circumstances with time, the classification may no longer have a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved. In such a situation, the law attracts unconstitutionality. 114. As identified above, the purpose of Section 6A was to deal with the influx of undocumented immigrants from East Pakistan to Assam. Section 6A provides that only undocumented immigrants who entered Assam before the cut-off date of 25 March 1971 shall be given citizenship. The beneficiary class of migrants is further divided into two sections: those who entered before 1 January 1966 and those who entered after 1 January 1966 but before 25 March 1971. The difference between Section 6A(2) and Section 6A(3) is that in the case of the former, the migrants are deemed to be citizens while in the case of the latter, they acquire citizenship after ten years from the date of detection. In the interim period (ten years since the detection), they lose their electoral rights. The consequence of being detected to be a foreigner who entered between 1966 to 204 [1986] 2 SCR 596 : (1986) 3 SCC 385 205 Also see Malpe Vishwanath Acharya v. State of Maharashtra (1998) 2 SCC 1 1306 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 1971 is that they lose their right to political franchise for ten years. Upon their detection, they will have the same rights and obligations as a citizen of India including the right to obtain a passport under the Passports Act 1967. Thus, undocumented migrants who fall in this category will be citizens of India upon detection for all purposes except the exercise of electoral franchise. The legislature in its good wisdom has proceeded on the basis that a consequence of such a great magnitude must only ensue upon detection as a foreigner through a quasi-judicial proceeding.
