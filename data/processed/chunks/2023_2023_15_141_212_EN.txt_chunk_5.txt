The Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, 2016, (hereafter referred to as “the Amendment”) introduces a fundamental re-ing of the constitutional premise of taxation by the Union and State Governments in India. It is the framework to enable the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). It confers new powers upon the Union Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies, and also creates institutions that have a signifi cant bearing on the federal character of the Constitution. 3. The pre-Amendment constitutional scheme had a vision of taxation of goods and services supplied within India. Excise and customs duty and excise on manufacture were within the scope of the legislative powers of the Union Parliament1, under the Seventh Schedule.
