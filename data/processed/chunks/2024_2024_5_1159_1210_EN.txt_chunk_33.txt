Digital Supreme Court Reports Note: Cases categorized under Group E, owing to their distinct facts and circumstances, may overlap with Groups A to C (excluding Group B.2, which we have dismissed as rendered infructuous). As a result, any directions issued under Group E are intended exclusively for that category alone, and such cases shall be automatically excluded from the purview of Groups A to C. For added clarity, it is stated that all cases falling under Group E shall be remanded back to the High Court, regardless of their classification within the aforementioned categories. Result of the case: Civil Appeals and Miscellaneous applications disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
