High Court was filed by the Respondents herein challenging the notice dated 17.01.2000 passed by the Divisional Forest Officer, Gorakhpur forfeiting the security amount of the Respondents. For the sake of convenience, we will refer to the parties as per their instant status before this Court. 3. Brief facts of the matter are that the Forest Department had issued a public notice dated 05.03.1998 inviting registered contractors for participation in a sale auction. In pursuance of the said notice, sale auction was completed on 27.03.1998 as per prescribed procedure and the Respondents offered the highest bids in respect of the various lots. On being declared as the successful bidders, an agreement was executed between the Appellant and the Respondent on the same date with respect to the lot No. 195 (38-H Nasirabad, Bankee Range). On the following day itself, a proposal was sent to the Conservator of Forests and Regional Director, Eastern Circle, Gorakhpur, U.P. by the Divisional Forest Officer for approval of the auction proceedings. The said approval was granted by the Regional Director on 14.05.1998. 4. Post approval of the auction proceedings, the Divisional Forest Officer addressed a letter to the Respondent on 15.09.1998 calling upon him to deposit the bid amount of Rs. 2,92,000/- against the respective lots latest by 25.09.1998, obtain their work s and conclude the work latest by 08.10.1998. It was further stated that in case, the work is not completed within the stipulated time as aforesaid, the security amount deposited with reference to the said auction shall be forfeited and auction proceedings shall be quashed. Even after the issuance of the aforesaid letter, the Respondents did not complete their work and accordingly, a public Notice dated 26.10.1998 was issued by the Forest Department directing the Respondent once again to deposit the bid money and conclude the work. Another notice dated 23.04.1999 was issued to the Respondent stating that the entire work should be completed latest by 15.05.1999, failing which, the amount of security deposited shall be forfeited and the lots in question shall be put to fresh auction. Respondent failed to take action and accordingly on 17.01.2000, the Divisional Forest Officer issued a letter to the Respondent communicating that for non-compliance of the directions given to them, the security amount deposited by them is being forfeited and the lot is being put to re-auction. 2430 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 5. As mentioned at the outset earlier, the Respondents, being aggrieved by the communication dated 17.01.2000, filed the Writ Petition before the High Court praying for directions to the Appellants to refund the security amount deposited by the Respondent. Before the High Court, the Respondents argued that since the approval to the auction was not granted within the stipulated period, they had applied to withdraw from the auction and were not bound by the said offer made in the auction and accordingly, security amount could not have been forfeited.
