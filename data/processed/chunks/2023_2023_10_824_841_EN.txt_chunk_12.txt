28. The High Court committed error by not relying upon the non- obstante clause in sub-Section 4 of Section 272 of the Act as it would have overriding effect over anything contained in that chapter i.e. Chapter C XVII. Section 272(4) of the Act, therefore, would have overriding effect over and above Sections 238 and 271 of the Act, once, it is admitted position that there was no supply of unfiltered water. The use of wholesome water for purposes other than domestic cannot be held to be violative of any of the provisions and all the more when the trade license D permitted use of the same. 29. Section 271 of the Act prohibits any person from using water supply for domestic purposes for any other purpose without the written permission of the Commissioner. Here, we find that the trade license which is issued by the KMC actually permitted use of water supply E whether filtered or unfiltered. Further in the absence of any supply of unfiltered water, the wholesome water could be used for non-domestic purposes. 30. For all the reasons recorded above, the Appeal deserves to be allowed. The impugned and s passed by the Division Bench of the High Court and the learned Single Judge are set aside. F 31. The writ petition succeeds and is allowed. The impugned notices therein are hereby quashed. 32. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. 33. KMC would be at liberty to initiate such proceedings as may G be permitted in law afresh. Ankit Gyan Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Tamana, LCRA) H
