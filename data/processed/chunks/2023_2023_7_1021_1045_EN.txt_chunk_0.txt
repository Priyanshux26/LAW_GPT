A – In fact, ‘V’ does not even have the status of a lessee, but is only a licensee and a license does not create any interest in the immovable property – NCLT as well as NCLAT rightly held that the possession of the Corporate Debtor, of the property needs to be protected and thus, a direction u/Regulation 30 was issued to the local district administration to give assistance to the RP for completion of CIRP B of the Corporate Debtor effectively. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.3(37) – Income Tax Act, 1961 – s.102(2) – “asset” – Held: The word “asset” is not defined, either in IBC or in any of the seven enactments referred to in s.3(37) of the Code – But the word “asset” is defined in s.102(2) C of the 1961 Act to include “property or right of any kind” – Though s.102 applies as such to Chapter X-A of the Income Tax Act, the definition throws light on the fact that property or right of any kind is considered to be an asset.
