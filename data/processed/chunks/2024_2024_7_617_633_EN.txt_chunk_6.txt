They argued that the CIC, as an administrative body, should not exercise such powers as it would blur the lines between administrative and judicial functions. The respondent contended that the High Court was correct in quashing the CIC’s and Regulations to maintain the distinction between administrative and judicial roles. II. The respondent highlighted a contradiction between the appellant’s assurances and the Central Government’s official stance. They noted that the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) had consistently stated that s passed by single benches of the CIC were void due to the lack of provisions in the RTI Act authorizing the CIC to constitute separate benches. This position had been conveyed to the CIC and was published on the DoPT website. The respondent referenced the DoPT’s correspondence and legal opinions obtained from the Ministry of Law and Justice. These opinions confirmed that the RTI Act did not empower the CIC to constitute benches. They cited specific letters and internal notes from the DoPT, which reinforced the view that the CIC should function as a full commission rather than through benches. III. The respondents maintained that neither the RTI Act nor the rules made thereunder provided for the formation of benches by the CIC. They emphasized that the absence of explicit provisions for benches indicated that the legislature did not intend to grant [2024] 7 S.C.R. 627 Central Information Commission v. D.D.A. & Anr. such powers to the CIC. As such, the CIC’s action in constituting benches exceeded the scope of its statutory authority. IV. The respondents contended that the CIC had overstepped its jurisdiction by delegating its inquiry powers to a committee comprising non-members. They argued that only the CIC itself or its members had the statutory authority to conduct inquiries under the RTI Act. The formation of such a committee, according to the respondent, violated the provisions of the RTI Act and undermined the statutory framework. V. The respondents supported the High Court’s reasoning that the CIC’s Regulations exceeded the powers conferred by the RTI Act. They endorsed the High Court’s interpretation that the broad powers of superintendence, direction, and management did not encompass the authority to frame Regulations for constituting benches or forming committees of non-members. The respondents agreed with the High Court’s view that Regulation 22 was ultra vires the RTI Act and the rules made thereunder. VI. The respondents highlighted the potential negative impact of the CIC’s actions on the functioning of public authorities. They argued that summoning high-ranking officials, such as the Vice-Chairman of the DDA, and constituting committees of non- members could create an undue burden on public authorities and disrupt their functioning. The respondents maintained that such actions were not envisaged by the RTI Act and should be curtailed to ensure the smooth operation of public authorities. VII. The respondents described the CIC’s current system as dysfunctional, highlighting issues like the establishment of multiple registries, arbitrary procedures, and a significant backlog of cases. They argued that the CIC’s actions under the guise of autonomy had led to inefficiencies and delays, undermining the RTI Act’s objectives.
