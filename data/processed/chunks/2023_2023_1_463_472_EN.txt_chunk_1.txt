[Para 9][471-B-C] 4. This Court while exercising power of judicial review cannot issue a writ of certiorari quashing the recommendation, H ANNA MATHEWS AND OTHERS v. SUPREME COURT OF 465 INDIA AND OTHERS or mandamus calling upon the Collegium of the Supreme Court A to reconsider its decision, as this would be contrary to the ratio and dictum of the earlier decisions of this Court, which are binding on this Court.

[Para 10][471-C-E] 5. The person in question has been elevated as an Additional Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Madras.
