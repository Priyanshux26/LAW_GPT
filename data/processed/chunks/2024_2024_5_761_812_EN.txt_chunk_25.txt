Relevant paras of the are extracted hereinbelow: “10. Several High Court s on the amended 8 Rule 1 have now held that given the consequence of non-filing of written statement, the amended provisions of the CPC will have to be held to be mandatory. See Oku Tech (P) Ltd. v. Sangeet Agarwal, 2016 SCC OnLine Del 6601 by a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court dated 11-8-2016 in CS (OS) No.3390 of 2015 as followed by several other s including a of the Delhi High Court in Maja Cosmetics v. Oasis Commercial (P) Ltd., 2018 SCC OnLine Del 6698. 11. We are of the view that the view taken by the Delhi High Court in these s is correct in view of the fact that the consequence of forfeiting a right to file the written statement; non-extension of any further time; and the fact that the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record all points to the fact that the earlier law on 8 Rule 1 on the filing of written statement under 8 Rule 1 has now been set at naught.” (emphasis supplied) 9.21 The of this Court in Barun Chandra Thakur’s case (supra) does not come to the rescue of the appellant. This Court in the aforesaid had only noticed the scheme of the Act in paras 59 and 60 and concluded that the conclusion of the inquiry and trials under Act should be expeditious, is the scheme of the Act. 21 [2019] 3 SCR 1050 : (2019) 12 SCC 210 : 2019 INSC 187 800 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 9.22 Hence, we are of the opinion that the time provided in Section 14(2) of the Act to conduct inquiry is not mandatory but directory. The time so provided in Section 14(3) can be extended by the Chief Judicial Magistrate or the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, as the case may be, for the reasons to be recorded in writing. 9.23 After holding that the period as provided for under Section 14(3) for completion of preliminary assessment is not mandatory, what further? We deem it our duty to clarify the position further. For this purpose, the tools of interpretation as were used in Afcons Infrastructure Limited and Another vs Cherian Varkey Construction Company Private Limited and Others22 could be aptly used to clarify the position further. In the aforesaid case, the consideration before this Court was the interpretation of Section 89 CPC. (See: paragraphs 20 and 21) 9.24 The rule of causus omissus i.e. ‘what has not been provided in the Statute cannot be supplied by the courts’ in the strict rule of interpretation. However, there are certain exceptions thereto. Para ‘19’ of the of this Court in Surjit Singh Kalra vs. Union of India and Another23 throws light thereon. The same is extracted below: “19. True it is not permissible to read words in a statute which are not there, but “where the alternative lies between either supplying by implication words which appear to have been accidentally omitted, or adopting a construction which deprives certain existing words of all meaning, it is permissible to supply the words” (Craies Statute Law, 7th edn., p.109).
