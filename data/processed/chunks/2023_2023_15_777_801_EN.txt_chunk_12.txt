Similar provisions have been made in relation to Parliament under Article 85 of the Constitution. 31. Kaul and Shakdher in their well-known treatise on the Practice and Procedure of Parliament (7th Ed) note that the termination of a session of the House of Parliament by an made by the President under Article 85(2) of the Constitution is called prorogation. Moreover, the President in STATE OF PUNJAB v. PRINCIPAL SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNOR OF 795 PUNJAB AND ANOTHER [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] exercising the power to prorogue the House acts on the advice of the Prime Minister. Usually, as the authors note, prorogation follows the adjournment of the sitting of the House sine die. However, the authors list several instances where the adjournment of the sitting of the House sine die is not followed by a prorogation and the sittings of the House are reconvened by the Speaker. A few illustrative instances discussed by the authors are set out below: (a) The Eighth Session of the Eighth Lok Sabha commenced on 23 March 1987 and was adjourned sine die on 12 May 1987. The Lok Sabha was not, however, prorogued. The Speaker reconvened the sittings of Lok Sabha from 27 July 1987 which continued till 28 August 1987. The two parts, preceding and following the period of adjournment of Lok Sabha sine die on 12 May 1987, were treated as constituting one session divided into two parts. On conclusion of the second part of the Eighth Session, the Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die on 28 August 1987 and was prorogued on 3 September 1987; and (b) The Third Session of the Ninth Lok Sabha commenced on 07 August 1990 and was adjourned sine die on 07 September 1990. The Lok Sabha was not, however, prorogued. The Speaker reconvened the sittings of the Lok Sabha from 01 October 1990 which continued till 05 October 1990. 32. Similar incidents of reconvening an adjourned sitting of the House, without prorogations can also be found in the (a) Fourteenth Session of the Eighth Lok Sabha which commenced on 18 July 1989; (b) First Session of the Eleventh Lok Sabha which commenced on 22 May 1996; (c) Fourteenth Session of Thirteenth Lok Sabha which commenced on 02 December 2003; (d) Seventh Session of Fourteenth Lok Sabha which commenced on 16 February 2006. 33. Article 208 of the Constitution provides that a House of the legislature of a State may make rules for regulating, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, its procedure and the conduct of its business. The Rules of Procedure framed by the Punjab Vidhan Sabha contain provisions which have a bearing on the subject under discussion. Rule 2 defi nes “prorogue” to mean the ending of a session by an of the Governor under Article 174(2) (a) of the Constitution. Rule 3 postulates that when a session of the Vidhan 796 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Sabha is summoned under Article 174 of the Constitution, the Secretary shall issue a notifi cation in respect thereof in the Gazette.
