Digital Supreme Court Reports weighed, measured, counted or when it is taken out of the notified market area. Thus, the bylaws introduced additional circumstances to the legal fiction contemplated under Section 12. 61. A two-Judge Bench of this Court identified the following relevant principles in matters of delegated legislation: “26. […] the delegate which has been authorized to make subsidiary rules and regulations has to work within the scope of its authority and cannot widen or constrict the scope of the Act or the policy laid down thereunder. It cannot, in the garb of making rules, legislate on the field covered by the Act and has to restrict itself to the mode of implementation of the policy and purpose of the Act.” Given the above principle, it was observed that Section 12 is a fiscal provision and had to be construed strictly. It was further observed that any circumstance, situation, factor, or condition which was not contemplated by the Act could not be taken into consideration to raise the presumption regarding sale or purchase of the notified agricultural produce. It was held that the bylaw introduced additional factors such as ‘weighed’, ‘measured’, and ‘counted’ which were not contemplated under Section 12. Therefore, the bylaws were held to be ultra vires for widening the scope of the presumption under Section 12. 62. In Assam Co. Ltd. v. State of Assam,74 the State Government framed a rule empowering the State authorities to reexamine the computation of agricultural income made by the Central officers. It was contended that this rule was beyond the power delegated under the Assam Agricultural Income Tax Act. A three-Judge Bench of this Court observed: “10. […] It is an established principle that the power to make rules under an Act is derived from the enabling provision found in such Act. Therefore, it is fundamental that a delegate on whom such power is conferred has to act within the limits of the authority conferred by the Act and it cannot enlarge the scope of the Act. A delegate cannot override the Act either by exceeding the authority 74 [2001] 2 SCR 515 : (2001) 4 SCC 202 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
