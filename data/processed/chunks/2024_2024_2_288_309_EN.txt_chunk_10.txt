It observed thus: “7. It is well settled that: 7.1. While dealing with an appeal against acquittal, the reasons which had weighed with the trial court in acquitting the accused must be dealt with, in case the appellate court is of the view that the acquittal rendered by the trial court deserves to be 4 (2022) 6 SCC 294 302 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports upturned (see Vijay Mohan Singh v. State of Karnataka5, Anwar Ali v. State of H.P.6) 7.2. With an of acquittal by the trial court, the normal presumption of innocence in a criminal matter gets reinforced (see Atley v. State of U.P.7) 7.3. If two views are possible from the evidence on record, the appellate court must be extremely slow in interfering with the appeal against acquittal (see Sambasivan v. State of Kerala8)” 27. In this case, the case of the prosecution substantially rests on the testimonies of PW-3 and PW-4 read with various documents, especially the reports of medical examination and post mortem. PW3 is the eye witness of the incident. His testimony has been rejected by the Trial Court by terming it as artificial. PW-3 deposed that he was present at the place of incident when the accused persons started assaulting the deceased and PW-4 on 28.06.1997 at around 4 P.M. PW-3 deposed that A3 had assaulted PW-4 as he was running for his life along with PW-3. PW-4 was attacked from the back and PW-3 successfully managed to hide behind the bushes. Notably, PW-3 hid behind the bushes and observed the assault till Marthandappa was dead and PW-4 was unconscious. He then came out to check them and fearing for his life, he again rushed behind the bushes. He admitted that he was hiding behind the bushes till sunset. Thereafter, he came out and started walking towards Devpura, although he admitted that there were a number of buses plying on the route. But PW-3 takes no bus and keeps walking towards Devpura. On reaching there, he sat at the bus stand and kept on sitting there. Fast forward to the next morning, PW-3 catches the bus only at 6 A.M. on the next morning. The explanation as to how PW-3 spent the entire intervening night of 28-29.06.1997 is missing from the chain of circumstances. The statement that he was simply sitting at the bus stand for the entire night, while Marthandappa was dead and PW-4 was severely injured and unconscious, fails to inspire confidence. More so, when the entire reason for hiding behind the bushes was 5 [2019] 6 SCR 994 : (2019) 5 SCC 436 6 (2020) 10 SCC 166) 7 AIR 1955 SC 807 8 [1998] 3 SCR 280 : (1998) 5 SCC 412 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 303 Mallappa & Ors. v. State of Karnataka the fear of life. Despite such fear, PW-3 did not choose to inform the police out-post, on the way from Devpura to Aidbhavi, and rather, he kept on sitting at the Devpura bus stop.
