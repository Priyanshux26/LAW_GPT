However, the ITAT after examining the opening and closing balance for D the AY 1996-97 to 2007-08 observed that in multiple years, inventory was shown in the balance sheet, without discussing the claim of the assessee and held that the transaction in question is sale of stock in trade. It appears that ITAT has neither dealt with the findings given by the AO nor verified/examined the total sales made by the assessee during the relevant time and during E the previous years. Merely on the basis of recording of the inventory in the books of accounts, the transaction in question would not become stock in trade. As per the settled position of law in to examine whether a particular transaction is sale of capital assets or business expense, multiple factors like F frequency of trade and volume of trade, nature of transaction over the years etc., are required to be examined. From the passed by the ITAT, it appears that the ITAT has without examining any of the relevant factors confirmed that the transaction was transfer of stock in trade. [Para 7][1019-C-F] G 2. The High Court has also failed to appreciate that even in the event of acceptance of claim made by the assessee, including the assertion that Rs. 15,94,06,500/- was shown in the tax return in the earlier AY i.e., 2008-09, the differential amount of H 1006 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A Rs. 10,69,79,146/- on account of reduction in sale consideration of development rights was to be assessed in the current year as either capital gain or business income. At this stage, it is required to be noted that as per the claim of the assessee and the entry made and reflected in the ledger account of the assessee as on 31.03.2008, an amount of Rs. 15,94,06,500/- was paid to a third B party i.e., SICCL. However, thereafter, according to the assessee there was a rectification deed dated 30.05.2008 and the amount was reduced from Rs. 15,94,06,500/- to Rs. 5,24,27,354/-. The ITAT has not even questioned the factum of refund of differential amount of Rs. 10,69,79,146/- to the purchaser on account of C rectification deed dated 30.05.2008. The ITAT ought to have appreciated that the moment the receipt of amount is received and recorded in the books of accounts of the assessee unless shown to be refunded/returned, it is to be treated as income in the hands of the recipient. However, the ITAT has also not considered the aforesaid aspect. [Para 7.1][1019-G-H] D 3. In view of the above and as observed hereinabove, the ITAT has not considered the relevant aspects/relevant factors while considering the transaction in question as stock in trade and has not considered the relevant aspects as above which as such were required to be considered by the ITAT, the matter is E required to be remanded to the ITAT to consider the appeal afresh in light of the observations made hereinabove and to take into consideration the relevant factors while considering the transaction as stock in trade or as sale of capital assets or business transaction.
