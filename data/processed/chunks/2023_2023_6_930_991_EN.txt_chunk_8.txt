[Para 69][989-F-G] G 1.23. The Act came into force on 01.01.1996. The first sale was effected on 14.10.1960. The second sale was effected on 26.09.1974. As far as the first sale is concerned, Article 96 cannot H 940 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A be pressed into service as the transfer was not purported to be made by the Mutawalli. The doors stood open for the application of Article 65. As far as the second sale is concerned which was effected in the year 1974, the Article 96 was not applicable, the only other competing Article vying for acceptance, appears to be Article 65. Applying Article 65 and as the adverse possession B would kick in from the date of the transfer, on the expiry of twelve years, i.e., in 1986 applying Section 27 of the Limitation Act whatever title remained within the meaning of Section 65 would stand extinguished. The Act was brought into force only with effect from 01.01.1996. The purport of Section 107 cannot be understood C to be that it would revive an extinguished title as nothing stood in the way of running of time from the date of the second sale under the law as it stood. [Para 70][989-G-H; 990-A-C] 1.24. No doubt, the law of limitation is what prevails as on the date of the suit. Taking 1997 as the date, on which a suit is D filed, and applying the Act, which enables the plaintiff to disregard the bar of law of limitation, it cannot mean that what stood extinguished under the earlier law would revive. [Para 71][990- C-D] 1.25. The issue in the High Court essentially centered E around the question whether Article 96 would apply and applying the same, the appellant could get around the impact of Article 65 read with Section 27 of the Act. Article 96 has no application. Even in regard to a proceeding under the Act be it Section 52 if as on the date the action is taken, the title in the property stood vested with the person in possession by virtue of Section 27 of F the Limitation Act then it may not be permissible to ignore the right which had been acquired.
