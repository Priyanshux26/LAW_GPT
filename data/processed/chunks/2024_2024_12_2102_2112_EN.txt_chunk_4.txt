The provision ensures that any decision to restrict a drug stem from a central, uniform, and scientifically informed process, guided by expert advice, safety evaluations, and considered policy determinations. This centralized approach is deliberate, aimed at preventing arbitrary or inconsistent local measures that would fragment the national drug regulatory regime. 9. In the present case, there is no notification issued under Section 26A of the D&C Act, 1940 prohibiting or restricting the aromatic tincture of cardamom. The absence of such a notification is decisive. Without it, the tincture remains a licensed medicinal preparation that can be manufactured and sold in accordance with the general rules and the conditions of the license held by the Appellants. The Respondent authorities cannot, on their own accord, treat this lawful product as a “prohibited article.” Any such classification by subordinate authorities would undermine the statutory scheme, which deliberately centralizes the ultimate decision-making power over prohibition with the Central Government. To hold otherwise would effectively allow local officials to unilaterally bypass the checks and balances embedded in the Act, and to create, in practice, an ad hoc ban outside the statutory process. 10. It must be noted that the “aromatic tincture of cardamom” is not “prohibited” as can be seen from the list of prohibited drugs as issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare through their gazette notifications which has been attached as Annexure P17 before us. The said tincture is prepared by licensed manufactures who are duly approved by the Indian Government and the appellant procures [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2109 M/s Bhagwati Medical Hall & Anr. v.

This provision empowers Inspectors, within the local limits of their jurisdiction, to exercise such powers as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of the Chapter or any rules made thereunder. The scope of this provision is essentially procedural, intended to facilitate inspection, sampling, seizure of non-compliant drugs, and enforcement of existing statutory and regulatory requirements.
