A greater degree of deference is shown to classification because the legislature can classify based on the degrees of harm to further the principle of substantive equality, and such classification does not require mathematical precision. The Indian courts do not apply the proportionality standard to classificatory provisions (…).” [Emphasis supplied] 180. Second, when gauging the reasonableness of classification, the Court must adopt a pragmatic view and refrain from deeming a classification unconstitutional solely because it is marginally under-inclusive.135 In adjudicating the validity of a statute, the concept of under-inclusiveness arises when a classification within the law 133 Ramesh Chandra Sharma, supra note 126, paras 34 and 40. 134 South Indian River Interlinking, supra note 132, para 33. 135 Shri Ambica Mills, supra note 128, para 55. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1081 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 fails to encompass all individuals similarly situated with respect to the law’s intended purpose.136 The approach of Indian courts towards under-inclusive legislation generally exhibits tolerance137 on the premise that the legislature is “free to recognize degrees of harm”138 and is allowed to “hit evil where it is most felt”.139 Moreover, this Court has also justified some under-inclusive classifications on the grounds of administrative convenience and legislative experimentation.140 181. Likewise, in Basheer v. State of Kerala,141 this Court upheld the validity of the law as long as it could be reasonably discerned based on intelligible differentia that advanced the object of the statute. The Court emphasized that merely because there is marginal under-inclusivity or the presence of cases falling on both sides of the dividing line, the law would not be declared as ultra vires of Article 14. In this vein, it held that: "20. Merely because the classification has not been carried out with mathematical precision, or that there are some categories distributed across the dividing line, is hardly a ground for holding that the legislation falls foul of Article 14, as long as there is broad discernible classification based on intelligible differentia, which advances the object of the legislation, even if it be class legislation. As long as the extent of overinclusiveness or underinclusiveness of the classification is marginal, the constitutional vice of infringement of Article 14 would not infect the legislation.” [Emphasis supplied] 182. This principle was reiterated in Subramanian Swamy v. Raju,142 where it was argued that individuals under the age of 18 could 136 Id. 137 Special Courts Bill, supra note 120, para 78; State of Uttar Pradesh v.
