Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere at Section 8 or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie certain that the arbitration agreement is non-existent, invalid or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the nature and facet of non-arbitrability would, to some extent, determine the level and nature of judicial scrutiny. The restricted and limited review is to check and protect parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably “non-arbitrable” and to cut off the deadwood. The court by default would refer the matter when contentions relating to non-arbitrability are plainly arguable; when consideration in summary proceedings would be insufficient and inconclusive; when facts are contested; when the party opposing arbitration adopts delaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration proceedings. … ” (emphasis supplied) 8 Having regard to the uncontested chronology of events detailed in paragraphs 1 to 4 above, it is abundantly clear that the notices invoking arbitration dated 4 July 2022 and 27 October 2022 were [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1235 Elfit Arabia & Anr. v. Concept Hotel BARONS Limited & Ors. issued eleven years after the cause of action arose in 2011.7 This is well beyond the limitation period of three years,8 and the claim which is sought to be raised is hopelessly barred by limitation. 9 The initiation of arbitration and criminal proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 are separate and independent proceedings that arise from two separate causes of action.9 Therefore, the institution of the proceedings under Section 138 does not imply a ‘continuing cause of action’ for the purpose of initiating arbitration, as erroneously contended by the petitioner. 10 The facts of the present case undoubtedly fall within the narrow compass of interference that courts must exercise at this stage. If this Court were to refer the dispute to arbitration, it would amount to compelling the parties to arbitrate a ‘deadwood’ claim that is ex- facie time-barred. 11 We, therefore, decline to entertain the Arbitration Petition. 12 The Arbitration Petition is accordingly dismissed. 13 Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. ARBITRATION PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 10 OF 2023 14 The companion Arbitration Petition, namely (Arbitration Petition No. 15 of 2023) has been dismissed by the above . Save and except for the date of the MoU which is 26 May 2004 in the present case, the facts are similar. 15 For the reasons already indicated, we arrive at the conclusion that the claim is ex-facie barred by limitation. 16 The Arbitration Petition is accordingly dismissed. 17 Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Result of the case: Arbitration Petitions dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Bibhuti Bhushan Bose (With assistance from: Nivedita Rawat, LCRA) 7 Section 21, Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. 8 Section 46(1), Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996; Article 55 of the Schedule, Limitation Act, 1963. 9 Sri Krishna Agencies v.
