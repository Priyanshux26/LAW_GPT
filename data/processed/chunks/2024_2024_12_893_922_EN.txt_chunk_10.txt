For example, sulphur put up for retail sale for therapeutic purposes is classified in heading 30.04 and not in heading 25.03 or 28.02, and dextrin put up for retail sale as a glue is classified in heading 35.06 and not in heading 35.05. 21. Chapter Note No. 3 in Chapter 33 of the HSN, titled Essential Oils and Resinoids; Perfumery, Cosmetics or Toilet Preparations’ is identical to the amended Chapter Note 3 in Chapter 33 in Section VI of the First Schedule, and it reads as follows: CHAPTER 33 ESSENTIAL OILS AND RESINOIDS; PERFUMERY, COSMETIC OR TOILET PREPARATIONS Chapter Notes. 1. … 2. … 3. Headings 33.03 to 33.07 apply, inter alia, to products, whether or not mixed (other than aqueous distillates and 910 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports aqueous solutions of essential oils), suitable for use as goods of these headings and put up in packings of a kind sold by retail for such use. 22. The General Notes thereunder, to the extent relevant, read thus: GENERAL ………. Headings 33.03 to 33.07 include products, whether or not mixed (other than aqueous distillates and aqueous solutions of essential oils), suitable for use as goods of these headings and put up in packings of a kind sold by retail for such use (see Note 3 to this Chapter). The products of headings 33.03 to 33.07 remain in these headings whether or not they contain subsidiary pharmaceutical or disinfectant constituents, or are held out as having subsidiary therapeutic or prophylactic value (see Note 1(d) to Chapter 30). However, prepared room deodorisers remain classified in heading 33.07 even if they have disinfectant properties of more than a subsidiary nature. Preparations (e.g., varnish) and unmixed products (e.g., unperfumed powdered talc, fuller’s earth, acetone, alum) which are suitable for other uses in addition to those described above are classified in these headings only when they are: (a) In packings of a kind sold to the consumer and put up with labels, literature or other indications that they are for use as perfumery, cosmetic or toilet preparations, or as room deodorisers; or (b) Put up in a form clearly specialised to such use (e.g., nail varnish put up in small bottled furnished with the brush required for applying the varnish). 23. Heading 33.05 in the HSN reads as follows: 33.05 – PREPARATIONS FOR USE ON THE HAIR. 3305.10 - Shampoos [2024] 12 S.C.R. 911 Commissioner of Central Excise, Salem v. M/s Madhan Agro Industries (India) Private Ltd. 3305.20 - Preparations for permanent waving or straightening 3305.30 - Hair lacquers 3305.90 - Other This heading covers: (1) to (3) --- (4) Other hair preparations, such as brilliantines; hair oils, creams (“pomades”) and dressings; hair dyes and bleaches used on the hair; cream-rinses. 24. Comparison of the relevant headings in the First Schedule to the Act of 1985, both pre-2005 amendment and post-2005 amendment, with the corresponding headings in the HSN reveals that Chapter Note 1(e) in Chapter 15 in Section III of the First Schedule remained the same even after the 2005 amendment and was identical to Chapter Note 1(e) in Chapter 15 of Section III of the HSN.
