82. Shri K. Parameshwar, learned Counsel, made a valiant attempt by drawing support from the letter of the UPSC dated 12.05.2023 by which the original EWS Certifi cate dated 19.02.2022 submitted by email dated 06.04.2023 by the petitioner Ved Prakash Singh was returned. The UPSC has, in their response, clarifi ed that as a practice original documents submitted after the Personality Test are returned, after scrutiny and a standard format letter is used for the same. They have also stated that since the Certifi cate produced by the candidate was not as per Rules and conditions in the advertisement, the same was returned and not accepted. In view of this, we fi nd no merit in that submission too. 83. In view of all of the above, the argument of Shri K. Parameshwar, learned counsel, that there was a past practice treating Rule13 as directory has no merit. 84. Ms. Preetika Dwivedi, learned Counsel, made an alternative submission. Her plea was that in the event of the Court upholding the rule and the action of the UPSC, the Court should exercise its power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Her plea was that to do complete justice, her client should be treated as an EWS category Candidate. 85. We refuse to grant the petitioners refuge under Article 142. In this case, by the rightful application of the OM and the CSE-Rules 2022, complete justice has been done to all. Article 142 is, no doubt, a useful weapon in the armoury of the Court. However, its exercise should be done with great caution and circumspection. We do not fi nd the present case as one, warranting the invocation of that power. Conclusion: 86. Based on the above discussion, our conclusions are as under :- i) The candidates claiming benefit of EWS Category for the purpose of CSE-2022, acquire eligibility only if they meet the criterion prescribed by the Central Government in the O.M. DIVYA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 81 [K. V. VISWANATHAN, J.] dated 19.01.2019 and 31.01.2019 and are in possession of the required Income and Asset Certifi cate (I&AC), based on the income for the year 2020-21. Further, as required under Rule 28 of the CSE Rules, 2022 read with the O.M. of 19.01.2019 and 31.01.2019 the candidate should have been in possession of the Income and Asset Certifi cate (I&AC) as on 22.02.2022. Any candidate not in possession of the I&AC in the prescribed format as mentioned herein above cannot claim the benefi t of EWS Category. Equally, as required under Rule 13 of the CSE Rules, 2022 at the stage of DAF-I, the document in possession as on 22.02.2022 in the prescribed format, had to be submitted online before the prescribed date. The UPSC was justifi ed in rejecting the candidature of those candidates claiming benefi t under the EWS Category if they had submitted their I&AC beyond the stipulated deadline. This conclusion has to be read with the reasoning in the , particularly in paragraphs 39, 40 and 41 under the heading “Eligibility for EWS category candidates for CSE-2022”.
