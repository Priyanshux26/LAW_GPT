2,24,100/-. V. Fitment and Migration from Master Pay Scale to Pay Matrix System (Recommendations 44.8, 44.9, 44.10) 56. The Court notes that the Commission has recommended the C formula and method to ensure that the migration from the master pay scale to the pay matrix system is smooth. The Commission has devised the follow fitment/migration formula: “i. Multiply the existing pay by the factor of 2.81. ii. The figure so arrived at to be located in Table-I, in D relation to the Level applicable to the Officer (i.e., J1, J2 etc.) iii. Where there is an identical figure available in Table-I at the corresponding stage of the relevant level, the new revised pay shall be fixed at that stage. E iv. Where there is no identical figure available, the new revised pay has to be fixed at the very next higher stage in that level in Table-I.” 57. In to make matters clear, the Commission has also given illustrations so as to simplify the fitment/migration formula for the relevant F authorities. These illustrations ought to be considered by the authorities while encoding the rules for the migration to the pay matrix system.27 It may be noted that the Commission has submitted a Corrigendum to its Report in March 2021 which has removed certain arithmetical mistakes from the Fitment Table. This is reflected in Part III of the Report dated G March 2021. 58. It may be noted that a similar formula and illustrations have also been devised for fixation of pay of judicial officers who were promoted on or after 01.01.2016 in the following terms: 27See Paras 13.5 at p.75 – 80 and Para 13.8 at p.81 – 82 of the Report. H ALL INDIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION v. UNION OF INDIA 63 [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J.] “i. Identify the level and the basic pay in Table I on the A date of promotion. ii. Add one increment in that level itself in terms of FR-22. iii. The figure so arrived at or the next closest figure in the level to which s(he) is promoted will be the new pay on B promotion.” The examples provided by the Commission also proceed thereafter to lend clarity to the formula for promotes as well. 59. While accepting this recommendation for fitment/migration as amended by the Corrigendum dated March 2021, it is also noted that C the examples must form part of the relevant rules that are required to be encoded by the High Courts, the States and the Union. Therefore, we accept the recommendation and direct the authorities to implement the same keeping in mind the examples that have been given by the Commission, as stated above. D VI. Application of Recommendations from 01.01.2016 (Recommendation 44.12) 60. The 7th Central Pay Commission came into force from 01.01.2016. However, the last pay revision of the judicial officers was with effect from 01.01.2006. More than 17 years have passed since the E judicial officers have received a pay revision. Noting this, the recommendation must be accepted by this Court.
