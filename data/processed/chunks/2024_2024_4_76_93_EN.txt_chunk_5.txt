The rules of limitation are based on the principles of sound public policy and principles of equity. We should not keep the ‘Sword of Damocles’ hanging over the head of the respondent for indefinite period of time to be determined at the whims and fancies of the appellants. 28. At this stage, we would like to quote few observations made by the High Court in its impugned pointing towards lack of bona fides on the part of the appellants. The observations are as under:- “9. A perusal of paragraph 4 extracted hereinabove shows that on oath, solemn statement is made that notice of Darkhast No.16 of 2014 for execution of the decree issued by the executing Court was received by the Department on 25.02.2019. As against this, in paragraph 3 of the additional affidavit dated 04.07.2019 made by Rajendra Rajaram Pawar, it is stated that the averments made in paragraph 4 as regards service of Darkhast on 25.02.2019 is factually incorrect. Notice of Darkhast No. 16 of 2014 was received by the defendants on 18.03.2016. The error in the application is out of inadvertence for which he tendered unconditional apology. It is further stated that inadvertent mistake on facts as to knowledge of execution proceedings was purely because of oversight in the light of possibilities of issuance of possession warrant by the executing court and requirement of expeditious urgency of moving before this Court to save the proceeding in litigation since 1981 which otherwise would have got frustrated. He stated that the same is nothing beyond human error. x x x x 84 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 12. The assertions made in paragraph 4 are bereft of any particulars and are totally vague. In fact the solemn statement made in paragraph 4 that notice of Darkhast for execution of the decree issued by the executing Court was received by the Department on 25.02.2019, to put it mildly, is incorrect statement. In view of paragraph 3 of the additional affidavit dated 04.07.2019 made by Rajendra Rajaram Pawar, it is evident that notice of Darkhast was received by the defendants on 18.03.2016. It is material to note that no particulars are given as to when the Department sought legal opinion. There is also no explanation as to why Department did not instruct lawyer in the High Court to apply for restoration of the Petition and why the Department defended execution proceedings. It is worthwhile to note that execution proceedings were filed by the respondents only because Writ Petition was dismissed. If the Writ Petition was restored, automatically the execution proceedings would have been stayed by the executing Court. Instead of adopting appropriate proceedings, the defendants unnecessarily went on defending the execution proceedings. In paragraph 4(b) though it is stated that Department was regularly following up with its panel lawyer till 2003, this statement is also not substantiated by producing any document. Even if I accept that the Department was regularly following up with its panel lawyer till 2003, there is no explanation worth the name as to why the Department did not follow up the matter between 2003 and 2006 when the Petition was dismissed in default.
