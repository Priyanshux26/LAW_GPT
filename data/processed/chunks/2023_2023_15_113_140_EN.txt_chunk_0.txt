[2023] 15 S.C.R. 113 : 2023 INSC 938 CASE DETAILS M.A BIVIJI v. SUNITA & ORS. (Civil Appeal No. 3975 of 2018) OCTOBER 19, 2023 [HRISHIKESH ROY AND MANOJ MISRA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: The complainant alleged negligence on the part of a Hospital – The main claim of negligence that the complainant attributed was that the forced Nasotracheal Intubation (NI) procedure resulted in her developing Grade-IV Subglottic Stenosis (i.e., narrowing of upper airway between the vocal folds and lower b of cricoid cartilage) in the trachea – Subsequently, the same led to various severe complications. Negligence – Medical Negligence – The NCDRC concluded that the negligence charge regarding the unjustifi able ‘NI’ procedure was proved – The act of replacing the existing Tracheostomy Tube (TT), with ‘NI’ was held to have been an avoidable course of action that was other than what should have ordinarily been done in that situation – The NCDRC awarded complainant a compensation of Rs. 6,11,638/- @ 9% p.a. for the medical expenses she incurred at Hospital – Propriety: Held: (1) Taking into consideration the medical literature on record as well as the expert medical committee report presented by the RML Hospital, it is reasonable to conclude that subglottic stenosis & subsequent trauma in the trachea is not an uncommon phenomenon with respect to a patient that has suff ered serious injuries in a road accident – In addition, there tends to be a higher risk element of developing an injury if intubation is done in an emergency situation or multiple times – It could also be a result of being subjected to intubation for a prolonged period; (2) In the instant case, the patient was treated and underwent diff erent procedures 113 114 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. at multiple hospitals – Therefore, there is a possibility that these medical complications could have arisen at any of these hospitals or places where the patient underwent treatment; (3) The medical report available in this case i.e., the RML Hospital Committee Report did not attribute any negligence to Hospital in question or the doctors with respect to any of the charges levelled against them – If the ‘NI’ procedure had been conducted in a negligent manner or was a poor medical decision, it is likely that the RML Hospital Committee Report would have mentioned the same – However, no such observation was made either; (4) The medical team at Hospital in question was able to show that the ‘NI’ procedure was carried out only after due consideration – The existing ‘TT’ was removed after the bronchoscopy showed normalcy in the airways & trachea of the patient – It was expected that the patient would be able to breathe normally without any support after ‘TT’ decannulation – However, a stridor was observed in the airways of the patient, after the said decannulation took place – In light of the same, an alternative course of treatment in the form of an ‘NI’ procedure was opted for as a temporary measure – There is nothing to show that the procedure conducted was outdated or poor medical practice – Resultantly, there was no breach of duty of care at Hospital in question or on part of the doctors – The charge of negligence is, therefore, not proved – Impugned set aside.
