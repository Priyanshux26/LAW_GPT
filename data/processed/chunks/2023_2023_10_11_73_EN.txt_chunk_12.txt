Therefore, the Special Court first concluded that BHEL suffered wrongful loss and that therefore, the offence under Section 420 IPC was made out. D 11. The Trial Court then took up for consideration, the argument that the confession statement of PW-16 (Approver) marked as Exhibit P-44 had to be rejected, in view of the fact that PW-16 had not stated anything self-incriminating in his confession statement. But this contention advanced on behalf of A-1 was rejected by the Court on the ground that E Exhibit P-26 is the chit in which PW-16 admittedly wrote down the names of four bogus firms and the name of M/s Entoma Hydro Systems, as dictated by A-1 and that this was sufficient to show that PW-16 was incriminating himself in the charge of criminal conspiracy with A-1. 12. When it was pointed out that as per the evidence on record, F PW-1 was on leave26.11.1992, due to the death of his mother-in-law and that therefore, he could not have had any discussion on that date, the Trial Court turned this very argument against A-1 and held that A-1 should not have approved the Approval Note dated 25.11.1992 marked as Exhibit P-27, if he was on leave and had not carried out a background check. G 13. The Trial Court thereafter held that the prosecution had successfully proved that the four other firms whose names were found in the chit Exhibit P-26 were all bogus. This was on the basis of the evidence of PW-2, PW-3, PW-5, PW-6, PW-7, PW-9, PW-10 and PW- 13. H 30 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 14. Believing the statement of PW-16 to be true, the Special Court came to the conclusion that A-1 predetermined the award of contract to A-5 and created circumstances and records to show as though proper procedure was followed and that therefore A-1 was guilty of the charges. 15. Coming to the charges against A-2, the Special Court held B that the only role played by him was to prepare the Approval Note dated 25.11.1992 and that in view of the overwhelming evidence against A-1, the contract would have, in any case, been awarded to the firm in question. Therefore, the Special Court came to the conclusion (in paragraph 79 of the ) that A-2 was merely asked to sign in Exhibit P-27, only to give credibility to the list prepared by A-1 and the C Approver acting in conspiracy. After reaching such a finding, the Special Court acquitted A-2 of the charges framed against him. 16. Insofar as A-3 and A-4 are concerned, it was argued that they came into the picture only after 23.12.1992, when the Negotiation Committee comprising of A-3, A-4 and the Approver was formed. But D this argument was rejected by the Trial Court by holding that what was constituted was a Tender Committee, as seen from Exhibit P-36 (proceedings of the Committee) and that therefore if they were innocent, they should have questioned and sought details regarding the contractors.
