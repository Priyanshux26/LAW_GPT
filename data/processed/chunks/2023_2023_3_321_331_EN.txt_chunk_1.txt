Despite the fact that on 16.04.2021, the Special Judge allowed police custody of the respondent-accused for seven days i.e., up to 22.04.2021, the respondent-accused got himself admitted in the hospital during the period of police custody, i.e., F on 18.04.2021 and obtained interim bail on 21.04.2021 which came to be extended till 08.12.2021 when his interim bail came to be cancelled by the Special Judge by observing that the accused has misused the liberty shown to him and during the interim bail he has not cooperated with the investigating agency.
