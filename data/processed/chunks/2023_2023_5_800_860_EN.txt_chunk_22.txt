D (b) Motive & Opportunity for the accused Prem Singh to commit said offence: The accused Prem Singh was certainly having ample opportunity to strangulate his children as it was about 7.45 p.m on that day when he took them to the Canal and admittedly, none else was present there. It is also shown from the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as already discussed at length that E the accused had doubt over the character of his wife Sunita and had preconceived notion that Jitesh and Sunny were not his sons and so, he had developed a grudge against his wife and children and finding an appropriate opportunity as his wife was not in the house, he took them to Haiderpur Canal with the motive to F eliminate them and asked the children to attend call of nature after which when his elder son come first, he strangulated him and thrown his dead body in the Canal and then his other son come whom also he strangulated and then had thrown his dead body in the Canal and thereafter, he himself jumped into the Canal to pretend that he had made efforts to save them which in fact G has not yielded him any benefit. (c) Conduct of the accused : The conduct of the accused Prem Singh has already been discussed at length that firstly he took both his sons to the Haiderpur Canal where he manually strangulated them and threw their dead bodies in the Canal and H 830 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A then he himself jumped into the Canal and swam for a considerable distance and came out, so that he could tell the others that he had made genuine efforts to save them but in vain which has been falsified as already discussed. It is also proved on the record that he himself narrated so to the officials of Water Treatment Plant and then to the employee of the nearby Petrol Pump from where B he also telephonically informed the police officials and then told the same story to the police officials. In fact, it was after the postmortem examinations of both the children, that it was crystal clear that they had not died of drowning but of manual strangulation prior to their drownings which injuries were sufficient in ordinary C course of nature to cause their deaths and after trying to mislead police officials, he joined investigation to show his bonafide which has proved futile for the accused. (d) Medical Evidence : As per record, though the accused Prem Singh has stated that both the children had died of drowning and had seen them drowning, yet their postmortem examinations D reports have falsified his version which have been duly proved on records by Dr.V.K.Jha who has categorically deposed that both the children were firstly manually strangulated which injuries were antemortem in nature and were sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause their deaths and the deaths of both the deceased E were the result of such strangulation and not of drowning which have entirely falsified the version of the accused that his sons had died due to drowning and it is proved that they did not die of drowning but of manual strangulation.
