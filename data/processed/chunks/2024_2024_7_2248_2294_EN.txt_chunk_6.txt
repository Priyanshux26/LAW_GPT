In that case also, the Reference Court determined the market value @ of Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. Though the certified copy of the said award was not exhibited, it was taken on record as Exh.131 C. Thereafter, it held that the appropriate market value 2256 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports would be Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. for the acquired property and ed the same with all the other consequential benefits. C. Findings of the High Court 14. The appellant and the State filed Appeals and cross Appeals before the High Court. The High Court held that on perusal of the maps, it was clear that the suit land was just on the bank of the river Morna and that the other Survey Nos. 5, 6 and 7 [which were the lands acquired in the awards relied upon by the Reference Court] were well above survey no. 1 beyond the Gaothan of Akoli (Bk) away from the river. The High Court found that Survey Nos. 5, 6 and 7 were further sub-divided and Survey No. 7/2 had been converted to non-agricultural use by dated 08.07.1982. According to the High Court, the sale deed (Exh.71) dated 10.05.1999 was in respect of Plot No. 50 admeasuring 3000 sq. ft. from Survey No. 7/2 @ of Rs.175 per sq. ft. The High Court held that the sale deed (Exh.71) could not be taken into account since the acquired land in the present appeals (Survey No. 1) were never converted to non-agricultural use. Insofar as the sale deed (Exh.72) dated 17.11.1999 was concerned, it rejected the same holding that the sale deed was after the Section 4 notification and that the sale deed dealt with a small piece of land and also appeared to be suspicious for the reason that while Exh.71 showed value @ of Rs. 175 per sq. ft., Exh.72 which was after the notification under Section 4 showed value @ of Rs. 601 per sq. ft. Insofar as Exh.33 was concerned, the High Court held that it was not shown from which survey number it arose and as to when the property was converted to residential use. 15. The High Court further held that the acquired land in the appeal was situated on the bank of river Morna and relied on the evidence of DW-2 Laxman Bhika Raut, the Land Acquisition Officer in support of the same. It relied on the findings of the Reference Court with regard to the blue colour only affecting a small strip of the land and held that the appellant had not seriously challenged the findings. It further held that upon perusal of Exh.141 map the finding of the Reference Court that only a small strip of land was affected by blue colour was also wrong since in Exh.141, major area of the suit land was in the ‘Blue Zone’. Thereafter, it held that since the suit property was affected by the ‘Blue Zone’, the same could not have been converted into non- agricultural use like other adjoining survey numbers and observed [2024] 7 S.C.R.
