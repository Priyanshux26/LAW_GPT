It is also stated that 23 lessees of Category C have not submitted any data. In three cases, R&R Plans submitted have not been approved by the CEC. 1312 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 96. We do not think, at this stage, it will be appropriate to withdraw the 10% levy imposed by this Court in terms of the dated 13.04.2012, as the CEPMIZ Plan is still at the initial stage of execution. The proposed plan was provisionally approved by this Court only vide dated 21.04.2022. Objections and suggestions have been invited and are pending consideration by the Oversight Authority. This apart, we feel certain directions are required to be given for preparation of R&R Plans and execution thereof in respect of Category C leases, which were terminated/cancelled, but thereafter no progress has been made for submission of the plans or execution or implementation of R&R Plans. 97. Accordingly, we deem it appropriate to direct the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests,20 State of Karnataka to undertake a detailed scrutiny and survey of all Category C mines, where data and R&R Plans have not been submitted and submit R&R Plans after conducting their scrutiny and survey. PCCF, Karnataka will be entitled to procure assistance from domain experts, specialized agencies or institutions. The cost incurred will be paid in the interim from the funds available with the SPV. The R&R Plans will be thereupon implemented and executed either through KMERC or if more appropriate, through any other agency, which may be nominated for this purpose after moving an application before this Court by the CEC, the Monitoring Committee, and the Oversight Authority. 98. The directions given above will equally apply to other cases of Categories A and B mines, where R&R Plans have not been submitted or approved. 99. The amount incurred for R&R Plans must be collected from the erstwhile Category C lease holders or the Category A and B lease holders, as appropriate. The amount will be collected as arrears of land revenue. However, no amount shall be refunded to the new lease holders. The amount collected will be deposited with the SPV. I.A. No. 41984/2023 100. This application has become infructuous and is disposed of. 20 For short, “PCCF”. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1313 Samaj Parivartana Samudaya & Ors. v. State of Karnataka & Ors. 101. We clarify that the applicant will be entitled to file a fresh application after this Court has received a report from the CEC in terms of the directions given above. I.A. Nos.17247/2020 and 17249/2020 and 17250/2020 102. I.A. nos. 17247/2020 seeks permission to file application for impleadment and 17249/2020 seeks impleadment. I.A. no. 17250/2020 has been filed seeking certain directions. 103. We see no reason to grant the prayer in the applications seeking directions to shift the category of the applicant from Category C to B. We have also examined the CEC report no. 23 of 2022. 104. All the applications accordingly stand dismissed. 105. In view of the aforesaid, I.A. Nos.
