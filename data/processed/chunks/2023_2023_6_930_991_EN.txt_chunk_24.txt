If by seeking shelter under Article 96 of the F Limitation Act, 1963, the period of limitation is to commence from the date of resignation of the Mutawalli then would not the period of 12 years commence from 01.05.1988 when Qasim Ali Khan, the Mutawalli resigned? Then, the period of 12 years would expire only in the year 2000. Could it not be said that the action was not barred? It is here that G the High Court reasons that Article 96 is not meant to apply to a void sale. Instead, it applies to a voidable sale. 22. There cannot be any doubt that Waqf property can be the subject matter of acquisition of title by adverse possession (see AIR 18 (2008) 9 SCC 306 H 962 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 1940 PC 116). That a Mutawalli however cannot acquire rights over waqf property by adverse possession is not open to question. (See AIR 1956 SC 713). 23. The High Court finds that Article 96 will not apply as it is a case of a void sale and not voidable sale. The reasoning is based on the B rationale furnished in the of the High Court of Orissa in Chintamani Sahoo (deceased by LR.) and others v. Commissioner of Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments, Orissa and others19. In the said case, the Division Bench of the High Court was dealing with the following facts: C The Mahant of a math executed certain permanent leases. It was without sanction of the Commissioner as contemplated in Section 58 of the Orissa Hindu Endowments Act, 1939. Such leases were contrary to the aforesaid provision. The Mahant came to be later dismissed. The Executive Officer of the math appointed by the Commissioner instituted proceeding under Section 68 of D the said Act for recovery of possession, which was allowed. He also instituted proceedings for recovery of possession under Section 25 of the Act. The Commissioner allowed the proceeding under Section 25 and directed issue of a requisition to the Collector for evicting the appellant who thereupon brought a suit for declaration E contending that he had acquired an indefeasible right of tenancy by uninterrupted possession and sought an injunction. We may notice the following finding: “8. The main question in controversy is as regards limitation and adverse possession. The finding of fact is that the plaintiff was in possession of the lands from the respective F dates of the leases, namely, 26-7-1943, 8-1-1944 and 15-7- 1944. The proceeding under Section 25 of the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act, 1951 was allowed on 30-10-69 and direction was issued to the Collector for delivery of possession. The right to evict the plaintiff would be barred by G limitation after expiry of 12 years which comes to 1956 if the starting point would be the dates of the respective leases. If, however, it is held that adverse possession of the plaintiff would start only after the dismissal of the Mahant, the right to recover H 19 AIR 1983 Orissa 205 SABIR ALI KHAN v. SYED MOHD.
