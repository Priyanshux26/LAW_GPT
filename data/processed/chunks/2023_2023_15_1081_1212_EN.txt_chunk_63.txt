This is the essence of the rule of harmonious construction; d. The courts have also to keep in mind that an interpretation which reduces one of the provisions to a “dead letter” or “useless lumber” is not harmonious construction; and e. To harmonize is not to destroy any statutory provision or to render it otiose. 150 CIT v. Hindustan Bulk Carriers, (2003) 3 SCC 57 151 (1997) 1 SCC 373 117 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 161. In Kandla Export Corporation v. OCI Corporation152, the issue before this Court was whether an appeal which was not maintainable under Section 50 of the Arbitration Act was nonetheless maintainable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act 2015. Section 50 the Arbitration Act provides that no appeal shall lie from the refusing to: (a) refer the parties to arbitration under section 45; and (b) enforce a foreign award under section 48. Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 allows any person aggrieved by the decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division of a High Court to fi le an appeal before the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court. 162. This Court referred to the objects of both the statutes to observe that the Arbitration Act is meant to eff ectuate a speedy resolution of disputes between parties, while the Commercial Courts Act 2015 is for the speedy resolution of commercial disputes involving signifi cant amounts of money. It was held that the provision of another appeal under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act 2015 in matters of foreign arbitration would be against the object of speedy enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. Therefore, this Court held that any construction of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 which would lead to further delay, instead of an expeditious enforcement of a foreign award must be eschewed: “Even on applying the doctrine of harmonious construction of both statutes, it is clear that they are best harmonized by giving eff ect to the special statute i.e. the Arbitration Act, vis-à-vis the more general statute, namely, the Commercial Courts Act, being left to operate in spheres other than arbitration.” 163. In Silpi Industries v. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation,153 the issue before this Court was whether a counter-claim was maintainable in arbitration proceedings initiated under Section 18(3) of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act 2006. Section 18(3) provides that where the conciliation proceedings initiated by any party are not successful and stand terminated without any settlement between the parties, the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council shall either take 152 (2018) 14 SCC 715 153 2021 SCC OnLine SC 439 IN RE: INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UNDER 1171 THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT 1996 AND THE INDIAN STAMP ACT 1899 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI ] up the dispute for arbitration or refer it to any institution or centre. The said provision further states that the provisions of the Arbitration Act shall then apply to the disputes as if the arbitration was in pursuance of an arbitration agreement referred to in Section 7(1) of the Arbitration Act.
