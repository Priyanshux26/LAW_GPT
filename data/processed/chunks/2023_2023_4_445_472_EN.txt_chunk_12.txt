ITS PROP. MRS. SANDHYA MISHRA 463 v. MPMKVVCL [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] 01.09.2018 about dispatch instructions for supply of transformers Level- A I. According to the learned counsel, the appellant having failed to fulfil the terms and conditions of TS-494, by the dated 19.11.2019, the respondents rightly cancelled the said purchase with imposition of penalty for non-supply of 286 transformers. It has been argued that the said termination had never been challenged by the appellant and B the same has attained finality. As regards the supply of 593 DTRs Level- II, the appellant was informed by the communication dated 22.02.2018 that the respondents had reserved the right to defer, reduce or reschedule the supply as per the requirement. According to the learned counsel, the appellant having failed to make the requisite supplies despite various requests, by the communication dated 18.09.2019, the appellant was C informed about deferment of supply until further instructions. 19. As noticed, the aforesaid communication of deferment dated 18.09.2019 has been strongly relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant to submit that after such communication, the respondents never issued instructions for supply or for withdrawal of such deferment and, D therefore, the blame could have been shifted on the appellant.During the course of submissions, in regard to the aforesaid line of arguments, we posed pointed query to the learned counsel for the respondents and afforded him an opportunity on 28.02.2023 to take all instructions while posting the matter for further hearing. Learned counsel for the E respondents has endeavoured to submit that the said communication dated 18.09.2019 is of no adverse impact on the validity of the s passed against the appellant. As regards the said communication dated 18.09.2019 and the contentions of the appellant on that basis, the learned counsel for the respondents has further submitted the additional written submissions and having regard to the questions involved, we deem it F appropriate to reproduce the relevant passages of such written submissions as follows: - “4. That a submission on behalf of petitioner has been made before this Hon’ble Court that vide letter dated 18.09.2019 (Page 148 Of SLP), the respondent/Electricity Company himself has deferred G the supply of 593 transformers of Level-II and as such, there is no fault on the part of the petitioner-firm in supplying 593 transformers. In this respect, it is most humbly submitted that the said submission on behalf of Petitioner is only to cover-up its defaults in not supplying the 593 transformers as per time schedule H 464 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A prescribed. The petitioner herein has not produced any document which can be treated as against the answering respondents and as such, an adverse inference cannot be drawn against the answering respondents. The submissions made by the petitioner are contrary to the material evidence available on records, thus, same are liable to be rejected. The petitioner herein was awarded B the contract on 22.02.2018 for supply of 593 transformers of level- II and in that regard a purchase was issued along with terms and conditions of said Contract to the petitioner.
