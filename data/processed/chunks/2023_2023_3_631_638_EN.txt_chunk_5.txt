The only argument pressed was that the compensation be paid as per the provisions of the 2013 Act. The Writ Petition was allowed relying upon the of this Court in Pune Municipal Corporation and Another’s case (supra). The High Court had also noticed the fact that there was dispute about H 638 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A title of the property which as per the stand taken by both the parties was kept open. Meaning thereby, even the compensation could not have been paid to the predecessor interest of the respondent/ writ petitioner. There is nothing on record to suggest as to what action was taken by the person who claimed interest in the property to seek compensation, in case land owned by him was acquired more than two decades back and no B compensation paid. The litigation started only with enactment of Act of 2013 15. For the reasons recorded above, the present appeal deserves to be allowed as the ingredients of Section 24(2) of 2013 Act as interpreted by this Court in Indore Development Authority vs. Manoharlal and C Others’s case (supra) are not satisfied in the case in hand. There cannot be lapsing of acquisition of land. 16. The appeals are, accordingly, allowed and the impugned passed by the High Court is set aside. The writ petition filed by the respondents in the High Court stands dismissed. D Ankit Gyan Appeals allowed. (Assisted by : Mahendra Yadav, LCRA) E F G H
