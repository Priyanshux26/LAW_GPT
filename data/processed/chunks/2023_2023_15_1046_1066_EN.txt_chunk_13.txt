In regard to matters in respect of which regulations made by the Board have not been notifi ed by the Governor or in respect of which no regulations have been made by the Board, the Industrial Employment (Standing s) Act shall continue to apply. 106 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. In the present case the regulation made by the Board with regard to age of superannuation having been duly notifi ed by the Government, the regulation shall have eff ect notwithstanding the fact that it is a matter which could be the subject-matter of Standing s under the Industrial Employment (Standing s) Act.” Relying upon the aforesaid decision, the Delhi High Court in Air India v. Union of India, ILR (1991) 1 Del 88 held that in to make the exclusion clause (under Section 13B of the 1946 Act) applicable a notifi cation is required to be made and that too by none other than the Government of India. The logical conclusion therefore would be that CCA Rules, 1965 are the general Rules whereas Standing s are the Special Rules, and therefore the Standing s would override the CCA Rules, 1965. Moreover, the Standing s cover a wide area of activities of a workman and are workmen specifi c yet in view of Section 13B of 1946 Act a specifi c notifi cation can be made applying CCA Rules, 1965 to that specifi c aspect. But a notifi cation is necessary. In view of the Hari Shankar Jain (supra), this can be the only interpretation of Section 13B of the 1946 Act. 18. The NFC was established much after the 1946 Act and the CCA Rules, 1965 had come into force. Yet a conscious decision was taken by the management of NFC to submit draft Standing s under Section 3 of the 1946 Act, which was duly certifi ed by the certifying authority and then notifi ed which then became applicable since then. Once the standing s have been notifi ed and have come into force, there is a procedure prescribed under the 1946 Act for modifying or withdrawing such a standing , which we have stated in the preceding paragraphs. There is nothing or record to show that after the standing s, which stood certifi ed in the year 1973 and were in force, any subsequent modifi cation was made or any passed curtailing these standing s, under Section 10 of the 1946 Act. Nothing has also been placed on record to suggest that a notifi cation under Section 13B of the 1946 Act was made by Government of India, making its intentions clear that from henceforth for such and such matters, it will be the CCA Rules, 1965 which will be applicable and not the standing s. In the absence of such notifi cation, we do not fi nd any fault with UNION OF INDIA & ORS. v. K. SURI BABU 1065 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] the of the Andhra Pradesh High Court which has held that it will be the standing s and not the CCA Rules, 1965 which will be applicable.
