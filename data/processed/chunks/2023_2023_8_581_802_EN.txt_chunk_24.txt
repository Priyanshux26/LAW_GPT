RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] to Article 19, a Constitution Bench in P.D. Shamdasani A vs. Central Bank of India Ltd.17, has held it to be inapplicable against private persons.

The majority in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (supra), defines the positive obligation of the State to ensure the meaningful exercise of D the right of privacy. In S. Rangarajan vs. P.

G 17 1952 SCR 391 18 (2010) 3 SCC 571 19 (1989) 2 SCC 574 20 (2001) 1 SCC 582 21 (2020) 12 SCC 436 22 (1989) 4 SCC 286 H 618 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A Question No. 4 (iv) The Minister being a functionary of the State, represents the State when acting in his official capacity. Therefore, any violation of the fundamental rights of the citizens by the Minister in his official capacity, would be attributable to B the State. The State also has a positive obligation to protect the rights of citizens under Article 21, whether the violation is by its own functionaries or a private person. It would be preposterous to suggest that while the State is under an obligation to restrict a private citizen from violating the fundamental rights of other citizens, its own Minister can C do so with impunity.However, the factum of violation would need to be established on the facts of a given case.
