v. 1213 UNION OF INDIA re-arranging existing social structures, by creating an entirely new kind of parallel framework for non-heterosexual couples, would require conception of an entirely diff erent code, and a new universe of rights and obligations – However, equality and non-discrimination are basic foundational rights – The indirect discriminatory impacts in relation to earned or compensatory benefi ts, or social welfare entitlements for which marital status is a relevant eligibility factor, for queer couples who in their exercise of choice form relationships, have to be suitably redressed and removed by the State – These measures need to be taken with expedition – This court cannot within the judicial framework engage in this complex task; the State has to study the impact of these policies, and entitlements – Union shall set up a high-powered committee chaired by the Union Cabinet Secretary, to undertake a comprehensive examination of all relevant factors – In the conduct of such exercise, the concerned representatives of all stakeholders, and views of all States and Union Territories shall be taken into account [Paras 69, 136, 139 and 149] – Held (per Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J.) (Concurring): The rights of LGBTQ+ persons, hitherto recognized by the Court, are the right to gender identity, sexual orientation, the right to choose a partner, cohabit and enjoy physical & mental intimacy – In the exercise of these rights, they have full freedom from physical threat and from coercive action, and the State is bound to aff ord them full protection of the law in case these rights are in peril – The question of marriage equality of same sex/LGBTQ+ couples did not arise for consideration in any of the previous decisions of this Court, including the decision in Navtej Singh Johar and NALSA – Consequently, there cannot be a binding precedent on this count – It would not be constitutionally permissible to identify a right to a union or an abiding cohabitational relationship mirroring the institution of marriage – In positively mandating the State to grant recognition or legal status to ‘unions’ from which benefi ts will fl ow, the doctrine of separation of powers will be violated. [Paras 4, 16, 17] – Held (per Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, CJI) (Dissenting): This Court is vested with the authority to hear this case – The freedom of all persons including queer couples to enter into a union is protected by Part III of the Constitution – Under Article 32, the Supreme Court has the power to issue directions, s, or writs for the enforcement of the rights in Part III of the Constitution –Under Articles 245 and 246 of the Constitution read with Entry 5 of List III to the Seventh Schedule, it lies within the domain of Parliament and the State legislatures to enact laws recognizing and regulating queer marriage – The failure of the State to recognise the bouquet of entitlements which fl ow from a union would result in a disparate impact on queer couples who cannot marry under the current legal 121 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R.
