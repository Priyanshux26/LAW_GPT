A perusal of these different conditions reflects various points of congruency between Section 6A and Articles 6 and 7. First, Section 6A prescribes that the immigrant must have been of Indian origin, defined in Section 6A(1)(d) to mean the person/either of whose parents/grandparents were born in undivided India. Hence, similar to Articles 6 and 7, the condition of birth/descent is present. Second, similar to Article 6, which does not stipulate the condition of registration before 19.07.1948 but necessitates it thereafter, Section 6A also lacks a requirement for registration before the specified cut-off date (i.e., 01.01.1966) but imposes it afterwards. Finally, mirroring the provisions of Articles 6 and 7, Section 6A(2) and (3) introduce the condition of residence, mandating that the immigrant must have resided in India since their immigration. 132. Furthermore, Section 6A aligns with the fundamental purpose of Articles 6 and 7, which was to extend citizenship rights to those affected by the country’s partition. Articles 6 and 7 aimed to safeguard the rights of individuals who were previously Indian citizens but 1066 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports found themselves residing in a foreign territory due to the political circumstances surrounding migration.105 Akin to this, Section 6A is also based on the same underlying policy reason of granting citizenship to the people of Indian origin migrating from Pakistan due to political disturbances in a foreign territory. Accordingly, Section 6A is aligned with the Constitutional philosophy of Articles 6 and 7 and is not contrary to them. 133. Regardless of these similarities, Section 6A diverges from Articles 6 and 7 in terms of the cut-off dates. As discussed earlier, Articles 6 and 7 prescribe the cut-off dates of 19.07.1948 and 01.01.1947, respectively. However, Section 6A prescribes two different cut- off dates: 01.01.1966 and 25.03.1971. Immigrants who entered Assam before 01.01.1966 are granted deemed citizenship, and immigrants who entered Assam between these two dates are granted citizenship once they fulfil certain conditions. Immigrants entering Assam on or after 25.03.1971 are not granted citizenship and are impliedly declared to be illegal immigrants who must be detected and deported. 134. The Petitioners’ contention that Section 6A is unconstitutional as it prescribes different dates in comparison to Articles 6 and 7 cannot be accepted because Article 6 does not prohibit the granting of citizenship after the cut-off date of 19.07.1948. It only specifies the fulfilment of certain conditions, which, as mentioned above, are also present in Section 6A(3). While Section 6A(2) grants deemed citizenship without these conditions, the competence of Parliament to prescribe different conditions—which will be analyzed in detail in the later part—is well embedded in Article 11. 135. Similarly, while Article 7 prohibits citizenship to people who re-migrated to India, this is only a sub-class of people who have been granted citizenship by Section 6A. Since Section 6A grants citizenship even to people who migrated for the first time, the class of re-migrants is severable from this provision. As will be discussed in the following paragraphs, the Parliament was competent to specify different conditions for this sub-class also.
