The bench relied on the earlier in Sureshta Devi v. Om Prakash55, wherein G it has been held that in a case of divorce by mutual consent, a party may withdraw the consent at any stage before the decree of divorce is passed. This ratio has been approved by a three judges’ bench in Smruti Pahariya 53 See –Manish Goel (supra), paragraph 23. 54 (2011) 5 SCC 234. H 55 (1991) 2 SCC 25. SHILPA SAILESH v. VARUN SREENIVASAN 209 [SANJIV KHANNA, J.] v. Sanjay Pahariya56. Consequently, following these s, Hitesh A Bhatnagar (supra) opines that a decree of divorce cannot be passed as the second motion, which is a requirement in law, was never moved by both the parties. It is also observed that non-withdrawal of consent within 18 months, the period stipulated in sub-section (2) to Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, has no bearing as this period of 18 months is B specified only to ensure quick disposal of cases of divorce by mutual consent. Sub-section (2) to Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act does not specify the time period for withdrawal of consent. Plea to grant divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown by invoking Article 142 of the Constitution of India was not entertained, albeit observing that this can be granted only in situations where the Court is convinced C beyond any doubt that there is absolutely no chance in the marriage surviving and that it had broken beyond repair. Nevertheless, the bench deemed it appropriate to state that they have not finally expressed any opinion on the issue of the power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India vis-à-vis dissolution of marriage. D 36.In Shyam Sundar Kohli v. Sushma Kohli alias Satya Devi57, the bench had refused to grant divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage, but also observed that only in extreme circumstances would this Court dissolve the marriage on this ground. 37. In Darshan Gupta v. Radhika Gupta58, the ground of cruelty E had not been established. Thereafter, the two judges’ bench, on examination of Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, observed that it is founded on ‘matrimonial offence theory’ or ‘fault theory’, and as a sequitur, the person who is at fault and commits cruelty cannot raise the accusing finger on the other spouse on the basis of those very allegations F and seek dissolution of marriage thereon. This case was peculiar as the person seeking divorce, as per the findings, was clearly at fault and to be blamed. The plea of irretrievable breakdown of marriage was raised and rejected as not postulated in the statutory provisions. Reliance placed on Gurbux Singh v. Harminder Kaur59, to urge that divorce should be granted in exercise of power under Article 142 of the Constitution of G India, was not accepted as the bench could not be persuaded on the 56 (2009) 13 SCC 338. 57 (2004) 7 SCC 747. 58 (2013) 9 SCC 1. 59 (2010) 14 SCC 301.
