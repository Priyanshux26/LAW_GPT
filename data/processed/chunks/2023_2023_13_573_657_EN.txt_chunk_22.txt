I, accordingly hold that the assessee is liable to penalty under Section 11AC of the Central Excise Act, 1944.” However, the tribunal has proceeded to hold that limitation would apply and show cause notice should not have been issued beyond one year in view of the fact that the assessee intimated their intention to change – vide Paragraph 22 of the impugned , without addressing the aforesaid issues which has been dealt in detail hereinabove. In other words, the tribunal by cryptic has negatived the contentions of the Revenue and held that the invocation of the extended period of limitation was not warranted. This fi nding, not being in consonance with the facts obtained on the hand, we are unable to subscribe our views to the of the tribunal. In that view of the matter, we are of the considered view that Question No.1 is to be answered against the assessee and in favour of the Revenue and affi rm the fi nding of the adjudicating authority and reverse and/or set aside the fi nding recorded by the tribunal which has been observed at the initial stage herein given that it is not only contrary to the facts but also contrary to law as noticed hereinabove. It is for these precise reasons the Adjudicating Authority was of the clear view that there has been a deliberate intention to avoid payment of duty by the assessee by misclassifi cation and willful misstatement of its product and hence it was justifi ed in invoking the extended period as provided in the proviso to Section 11A(1) of CE Act, 1944. RE: Q.2 – WHETHER ASSESSEE’S CLASSIFICATION FOR THE PERIOD IN DISPUTE IS TO BE ACCEPTED? 44. In the instant case the principle of admission is the best proof that can be applied to conclude that the assessee itself had classifi ed the product as ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ based on the declaration in ER-I returns for April 2006 and onwards. On advent of 8-digit era under the CETA, ‘chewing tobacco’ was classifi ed under CET SH 2403 9910, and ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ came to be separately classifi ed under CET 604 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. SH 2403 9930 from 01.03.2005 despite such classifi cation, the notifi cation issued in respect of goods to be assessed on the basis on MRP continued to show the tariff heading and the goods covered under ‘chewing tobacco’ head as 2404.41. When Notifi cation No.2 of 2006 dated 01.03.2006 came to be issued and it refl ected under Serial No.28 that all goods classifi ed under entry SH 2403 9910 to 2403 9920 were covered for MRP assessment and the product ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was not included under said entry, it necessarily meant that ‘zarda scented tobacco’ could not be determined under MRP assessment scheme. 45. The signatory to the ER – 1 returns fi led by the assessee for the relevant period was Smt. Sheetal K Majithia, Director – Finance and she was the one who took the decision to change the classifi cation of the product.
