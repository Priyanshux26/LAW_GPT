969 Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v. MB Power (Madhya Pradesh) Limited & Ors. 98. This Court has clearly held that when a right is created by a statute, which itself prescribes the remedy or procedure for enforcing the right or liability, resort must be had to that particular statutory remedy before invoking the discretionary remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. 99. Recently, this Court in the case of M/s South Indian Bank Ltd. & Ors. (supra) has also taken a similar view. 100. There is another ground on which the High Court ought to have refused to entertain the petition. The bid of L-7 bidder was returned and the Bid Bond bank guarantee was also directed not to be extended vide the communication dated 6th January 2015. The and passed by this Court, on which reliance is placed by respondent No.1, is also delivered on 25th April 2018. However, the respondent No.1 did not take any steps from 6th January 2015 and in any case, from 25th April 2018 till 14th December 2020, on which date the petition came to be filed before the High Court. No doubt that the petition need not be dismissed solely on the ground of delay and laches. However, if petitioner approaches the Court with delay, he has to satisfy the Court about the justification for delay in approaching the Court belatedly. In our considered view, the High Court ought not to have entertained the petition also on the ground of delay and laches. 101. In any case, we find that the High Court was not justified in issuing the mandamus in the nature which it has issued. This Court in the case of Air India Ltd. v. Cochin International Airport Ltd. and others14 has observed thus: “7. The law relating to award of a contract by the State, its corporations and bodies acting as instrumentalities and agencies of the Government has been settled by the decision of this Court in Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India [(1979) 3 SCC 489], Fertilizer Corpn. Kamgar Union (Regd.) v. Union of India [(1981) 1 SCC 568], CCE v. Dunlop India Ltd. [(1985) 1 SCC 260 : 1985 SCC (Tax) 75], Tata Cellular v. Union of India [(1994) 6 SCC 651], Ramniklal N. Bhutta v. State of Maharashtra [(1997) 1 SCC 134] and Raunaq International 14 [2000] 1 SCR 505 : (2000) 2 SCC 617=2000 INSC 39 970 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Ltd. v. I.V.R. Construction Ltd. [(1999) 1 SCC 492] The award of a contract, whether it is by a private party or by a public body or the State, is essentially a commercial transaction. In arriving at a commercial decision considerations which are paramount are commercial considerations. The State can choose its own method to arrive at a decision. It can fix its own terms of invitation to tender and that is not open to judicial scrutiny. It can enter into negotiations before finally deciding to accept one of the offers made to it.
