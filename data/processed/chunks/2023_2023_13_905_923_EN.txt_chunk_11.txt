The only explanation, if any, for this delay can be found in paragraph 4 of the writ petition, where it is stated that dated 26.11.1977 was ex-parte. Even if we accept that dated 26.11.1977 was ex parte, there is no disclosure in the writ petition as to when it came to the knowledge of the original petitioner. 32. What is even more interesting is that in the third writ petition there is no specifi c statement that recital in the , dated 27.03.1987, with regard to taking of possession is incorrect. Though it is stated in paragraph 9 of the writ petition that under s dated 26.11.1977 and 27.3.1987 possession was never taken. It be noted that possession was not taken under dated 27.03.1987. Rather, it is alleged to have been taken pursuant to notifi cation dated 15.1.1979. Thus, by the time third writ petition was fi led, a vesting notifi cation had already been published in the offi cial gazette on 15.1.1979. Further, the Competent Authority’s dated 27.03.1987 categorically stated that State has taken possession of the land. Yet, there is no statement in the writ petition that dated 27.03.1987 bears an incorrect recital with regard to taking of possession. For all the reasons above, in our view, the High Court ought to have been circumspect about the claim of the original petitioner that possession was not taken right up to the enforcement of the Repeal Act, 1999. 33. As far as documentary material placed by the original petitioner is concerned, we notice that no Khatauni or Khasra extract of the period (cid:0) MANOJ MISRA, J. (cid:1) 922 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. starting from 1979 up to 1987 was fi led. The third writ petition annexes Khatauni or Khasra extracts of the period 1405 to 1417 Fasli, that is of the year 1998 to the year 2010. In addition to those documents, some revenue receipts of the period starting from 1989 have been fi led. According to the State, possession of the surplus land was taken in the year 1979. If it were so, even if the petitioner entered into possession anytime thereafter, may be on the strength of the ex parte interim dated 20.08.1987, the same would not defeat the right of the State in view of decision of this Court in Indore Development Authority (supra) where, in paragraph 258 of the , it was held that once title of the land vests in the State, consequent to acquisition and taking of possession, even if the landholder has retained possession or otherwise trespassed upon it after possession has been taken by the State, he is just a trespasser and his possession, if any, would be on behalf of the owner i.e., the State. 34. At this stage, we may notice to reject another argument made on behalf of the respondent, which is, that the High Court had granted an interim , dated 20.08.1987, protecting original petitioner’s possession, therefore, it is to be assumed that possession was not taken from him by that time.
