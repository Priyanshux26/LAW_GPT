The Deputy Commissioner, who adjudicated them, ruled against the assessee and held that the goods were classifiable under CH 8529. 9090. The assessee’s appeal succeeded, and the Commissioner directed a remand. The Dy. Commissioner, after G remand, confirmed the show cause notice, and affirmed the classification proposed by it; the assessee appealed against this , unsuccessfully. The Commissioner (Appeals) rejected its appeal. It, therefore, approached the CESTAT, which by the impugned , set aside the demand, and upheld the assessee’s plea that the proper classification of the goods was in CH 9013.8010. H 264 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 6. In the Harman appeal too, the assessee claimed that the imported items i.e., LCD panels [declared before the customs authorities as “Liquid Crystal Devices-TFT-LCD 4.8 in”] for car audio assemblies, were properly classifiable in CH 9013.8010. Its contention was rejected by the revenue authorities, who classified it as “Sound Recording or Reproducing Apparatus” in CH 8519, and fell in CH 8522, item B 8522.9000. CH 8522 reads as follows: “8522 Parts and accessories suitable for use solely or principally with the apparatus of headings 8519 or 8521” The litigation history in Harman’s case followed a trajectory similar C to Videocon’s; ultimately, by the impugned , CESTAT upheld its contention that the goods, meant for use in car audio systems, were classifiable in CH 9013.8010. Contention of parties 7. Ms. Nisha Bagchi, learned counsel appearing for the revenue, D argued that the findings of the CESTAT are erroneous. She argued that the literature and other documents reveal that the LCD panels have specific model numbers. She pointed to the fact that the websites of the manufacturers of the imported articles are meant for use in LCD TVs. It was undeniable that the imported items were used in the manufacture of LCD TVs. Some, however, were used in manufacturing monitors, E though they were not sold in the market. Therefore, the goods were LCD devices principally used in the manufacture of LCD TVs. LCD TV is an apparatus covered specifically under heading 85.25 & 85.28. 8. Counsel argued that heading 90.13 covers only those articles which are not provided for more specifically in other headings. In the F present case, LCDs are specifically mentioned as parts of LCD TVs in heading 85.29. Therefore, they cannot be classified under heading 90.13. Reliance was placed on G.S. Auto International Ltd v Collector of Central Excise5. It was emphasized that in G.S. Auto (supra), this court held that the true test for classification is the test of commercial identity G and not functional test. Therefore, the correct question is how the articles are referred to in the market by those who deal with them, whether for purchase, sale or otherwise. The commercial parlance test, therefore, is determinative. Counsel submitted that the court in GS Auto (supra) 5 [2003] 1 S.C.R. 372: 2003 (152) ELT 3 (SC) H CCE, AURANGABAD v. M/S VIDEOCON INDUSTRIES LTD. 265 THR. ITS DIRECTOR [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] referred to Notes 2(b) and (3) of Section XVII and observed that a joint A reading of the notes would show that the expression “parts of general use” throughout the schedule, meant, articles of Heading No.
