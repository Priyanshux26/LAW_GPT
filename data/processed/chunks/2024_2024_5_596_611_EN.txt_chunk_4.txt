The specific plea of the appellant that the Act [2024] 5 S.C.R. 603 Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation Limited v. Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation Employees Welfare Union & Anr. as also the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Act, 19478 would not be applicable to the appellant. However, the same was not considered by the High Court. The only manner in which the said Act could be applicable was that the Corporation would fall under the definition of ‘commercial establishment’ under Section 2(3) of the 1947 Act. b) That the impugned did not analyze whether any of the activities of the Corporation fell under Section 2(3) of the 1947 Act. Section 7 of the Act exempts such of those industrial establishments, that are engaged in construction activities and since some of the activities of the Corporation, include construction, the Corporation would be exempt. c) That most of the 53 employees who are appellants in Appeal arising out of SLP(C)No.2649 of 2020, who were directed to be given permanent status by the Inspector of Labour, have obtained other profitable employment and the Corporation cannot be forced to grant permanent status. 15.
