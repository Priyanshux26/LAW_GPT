Hence, the very ingredients of the offence under Section 452, namely, the criminal trespass as contemplated in Section 441 and house trespass as contemplated in Section 442 having not been made out by the prosecution, the appellant could not have been convicted for the offence under Section 452 IPC. 11. In our opinion, both the Courts having miserably failed to appreciate the said provisions in the light of the facts of the case, the conviction of the appellant for the offence under Section 452 IPC is liable to be set aside. 12. In that view of the matter, the conviction made and sentence awarded by the Trial Court and confirmed by the High Court is further confirmed so far as the offence under Section 324 IPC is concerned, however, the conviction made and sentence awarded for the offence under Section 452 IPC by the Trial Court and confirmed by the High Court is hereby set aside. The appellant is acquitted for the offence under Section 452 IPC. 13. Since the appellant has already undergone two years of sentence, so far as the conviction under Section 324 is concerned, the appellant is set free, if not required in any other case. However, it is clarified that the appellant shall be liable to pay the fine as directed by the Trial Court, if not paid so far, or in default thereof, shall undergo the sentence as directed by the Trial Court. The Trial Court shall verify the status of sentence undergone by the appellant and payment of fine, if any, made by him, and if not paid, shall proceed against [2024] 11 S.C.R. 791 Sonu Choudary v. State of NCT Delhi the appellant – accused in accordance with law and also issue the non-bailable warrant as may be required, for undergoing remaining part of sentence, if any,. 14. The Appeal stands partly allowed accordingly. 15. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal partly allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
