10,77,53,842/- after the Effective Date of the Scheme – The said amount has already been disbursed to the landowners – After the LAC determined the amount under the Award dated 08.06.2018, JAL paid the same without any protest or reference to the Scheme – Therefore, at the stage of the Supplementary Award pertaining to the same land and same original landowners, JAL cannot be allowed to take the plea that the payments with respect to the subject land were required to be made by the Appellant. [Paras 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29] Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 – s.101 – It is the case of JAL that the substantial delay in acquisition of the subject land has frustrated its purpose, and it could not make any use of the land – It was submitted that if the Appellant does not require the said land, then it should be returned to the original landowners and the amount of Rs. 10,77,53,842/- paid under the Award of 2018 should be refunded to JAL: Held: The necessary conditions for the application of Section 101 are: (1) the land should be unutilized; and (2) the period it remains not in use should be at least five years from the date of taking of possession – There is no merit in the contention of JAL that the land be returned to the original landowners – [2024] 9 S.C.R. 445 M/s Ultra-Tech Cement Ltd. v. Mast Ram & Ors. While period of five years has elapsed from the date of taking of possession by JAL, the first condition that the land should remain unutilized is not fulfilled – The subject land was acquired for the purpose of providing a safety zone to the mining area of the cement plant – No other use except that the subject land may pose hazard to the residents was envisaged during the acquisition proceedings – JAL cannot pray for return of the land as that would result in endangering the lives and property of the original landowners – It is also found that the subject land has been in use all throughout the operation of the cement project by serving as a safety zone and the condition of being unutilized is not satisfied – It is not in dispute that the Supplementary Award had to be passed as the compensation for standing crops, structures and other damages for the subject land which could not be fixed and evaluated under the Award No. 1 dated 08.06.2018 – The passing of Supplementary Award was not a fresh exercise but rather a continuation/extension of the Award of 2018 – Therefore, when JAL has already paid the compensation amount as determined under the previous Award without any demur, it cannot be allowed to question its liability under the Supplementary Award and make a plea for return of the land at this stage on the ground that the purpose of the land is frustrated due to delay in acquisition proceedings. [Paras 35, 36, 37, 38, 39] Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 – s.101 – Scope of: Held: The instant section was introduced in the 2013 Act for the first time as a beneficial provision for the landowners whose lands were usurped but remained unutilized or were not used in accordance with the purpose stated in the notifications under Section 4 – However, the application of the Section is warranted only in the circumstances where the return of the land would benefit the landowners – The party which has failed to utilize the land cannot plead for the return of the land and consequent refund of the compensation paid, as that would tantamount to taking advantage of its own wrong or default.
