2. It is submitted that the Petitioner has been calculating the freight amount for a distance of 444 km as it was ‘notified’ in the old distance table. Therefore, this cannot be termed as overcharge. Admittedly, upon realizing that the said distance was wrongly calculated, the appropriate authority of the Petitioner ‘critically reviewed’ the old distance tables and thereafter notified the corrected distance/ rate between BAD to HSR as 333.18 km on 05.07.2005 (i.e. Annexure P-3 @ Pg. 146 of SLP). This notification of corrected distance made the earlier realization of freight for 444 km under the erstwhile notified rates, illegal. Further, the cause of action for recovery of such illegal realization’ of freight arose on 05.07.2005, when the corrected distance was notified by the Petitioner. Immediately, the Respondent filed its claim petitions on 07.11.2005 for recovery of excess amount for the extra distance which was illegally realized by the Petitioner. 3. The present case is squarely covered by a of this Hon’ble Court passed in the matter of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited v. Union of India, (2018) 17 SCC 729 (attached herewith). In the said case, the Petitioner therein (i.e. Hindustan Petroleum Corpn.) paid freight to the Railways (i.e. Petitioner herein) for the notified distance of 125 km, between the period 01.04.2008 to 30.09.2010. Subsequently, the said distance of 125 km was corrected by the 1074 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Railway to 100 km on 27.02.2011. Immediately, HPCL filed its claim petitions on 30.03.2011, which were rejected as being time barred U/s 106(3) of the Railways Act, 1989 by the Railways; Railways Tribunal & the High Court. When the said matter reached this Hon’ble Court, the Railways (i.e. the Petitioner herein) placed reliance on the of this Hon’ble Court in Birla Cement Works, (1995) 2 SCC 493 to buttress its argument that the claims filed by HPCL were barred U/s 106(3) of the Railways Act. It is submitted that the said of Birla Cement Works was distinguished by this Hon’ble Court and it was held that excess realization of freight by the Railways from HPCL was ‘illegal’ and therefore HPCL’s claims were allowed. It was further held that there was no requirement of giving any notice under Section 106 of the Railways Act as there was no overcharge by the Railways. The findings of this Hon’ble Court in HPCL’s case are as follows: “8. Birla Cement Works [Birla Cement Works v. Western Railways, (1995) 2 SCC 493] was a case where the petitioner therein (i.e. Birla Cement Works) came to know of the alleged excess amount of freight on wrong calculation of distance through a letter dated 12-10-1990 issued by the Railway authorities. This primary fact is conspicuously absent in the present case. In the present case what was paid was as per the fixed rate on the basis of notified distance which subsequently was corrected by another Notification upon introduction of the Terminal Mechanism System (TMS) at Asaudah Railway Station, District Rohtak, Haryana. 9. On the other hand, in West Coast Paper Mills Ltd. [Union of India v. West Coast Paper Mills Ltd., (2004) 3 SCC 458] this Court in para 20 of the said Report took the view that as the freight paid was as per the rates notified [2024] 3 S.C.R.
