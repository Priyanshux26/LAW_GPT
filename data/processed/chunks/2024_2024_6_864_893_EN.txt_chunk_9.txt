If the accused was not arrested till the filing of the complaint but has not cooperated with the investigation by defying summons issued under Section 50 of the PMLA, the Special Court may issue a bailable warrant at the first instance while issuing the process. But even in such a case, it is not mandatory to issue a warrant while issuing process; instead issuance of a summons would suffice. When an accused is on bail, while issuing the process, the Special Court will have to issue only a summons. When the accused is granted bail in the same case, it is not necessary to arrest him after taking cognizance. If such an accused does not remain present after service of summons without seeking an exemption, the Special Court can always issue a warrant to secure his presence. 9. Section 61 of the CrPC provides for the form of summons. Form No. 1 in the 2nd Schedule is the prescribed form of summons under Section 61 of the CrPC. For the sake of convenience, we are reproducing Form No. 1: Form 1 [See Section 61] Summons to an accused person To (name of accused) of (address). Whereas your attendance is necessary to answer to a charge of (state shortly the offence charged), you are hereby required to appear in person (or by pleader, as the case may be) before the (Magistrate) of __________, on the _____day of _______Herein fail not. Dated, this day of , 20 (Seal of the Court) (Signature) ______________ 878 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Looking at the form of the summons, it is apparent that it is issued only to secure the presence of the accused before the Court to answer the charge. If the accused appears before the Court, there is sufficient compliance with the summons. Hence, the question of taking him into custody on his appearance before the Court pursuant to the summons does not arise at all. 10. We fail to understand the basis of the submission of the learned ASG that after an accused appears before a Special Court in compliance with the summons, he shall be deemed to be in custody. The object of issuing a summons is to secure the accused’s presence before the Court. It is not issued for taking an accused in custody. An argument is made that once an accused appears before the Special Court, as provided under sub-Section (1) of Section 437, he has to apply for bail. For ready reference, we are reproducing sub-Section (1) of Section 437, which reads thus: “437. When bail may be taken in case of non-bailable offence.— (1) When any person accused of, or suspected of, the commission of any non-bailable offence is arrested or detained without warrant by an officer in charge of a police station or appears or is brought before a Court other than the High Court or Court of session, he may be released on bail, but— (i) such person shall not be so released if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life; (ii) such person shall not be so released if such offence is a cognizable offence and he had been previously convicted of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for seven years or more, or he had been previously convicted on two or more occasions of a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment for three years or more but not less than seven years: Provided that the Court may direct that a person referred to in clause (i) or clause (ii) be released on bail if such person is under the age of sixteen years or is a woman or is sick or infirm: [2024] 6 S.C.R.
