5A(1) – An interested person who fails to file objections, is deemed to have acquiesced to the acquisition – Maxim ‘Omnia Consensus Tollit Errorem’, i.e., every assent removes error is attracted in case of such owners – High Court could still have invalidated the acquisition qua these landowners had there been a reason going to the very root of the entire acquisition like the ‘public purpose’ of acquisition being conspicuously absent, or the acquisition process being an outcome of colorable exercise of power of eminent domain – In such cases, all the landowners, even if they had not filed objections, could seek annulment of the declaration issued u/s.6 – However, no such plea was taken in the instant batch of cases except that the procedure contemplated u/s.5A was deflated – Such objections were personal to the landowners, as they sought individual exemption on [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1003 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. Darshan Lal Bohra & Ors. the plea that they had raised residential constructions on their land under acquisition – Since it was a ground specific to each property, High Court was wrong to grant the benefit en masse and quash the entire declaration issued u/s.6 of the 1894 Act. [Paras 22, 23] Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – Challenge to acquisition proceedings also by respondents-landowners who though filed objections u/s.5A but, subsequently accepted compensation: Held: When a landowner receives compensation volitionally subsequent to filing of the objections u/s.5A and does not preserve the right to pursue such objections, there is implied consent to the acquisition – Having once acquiesced so, a landowner cannot be permitted to do a volte-face and re-agitate the objections – Holding otherwise, would open a Pandora’s Box where the landowners will, on one hand, seek re-enquiry of their claims u/s.5A and, on the other, will also draw the compensation – Thus, there would, be no finality to the proceedings and the acquisition process would be tainted by uncertainty and unpredictability which would further have a chilling effect on the development projects – Therefore, such respondents non-suited on the ground that they accepted compensation without any protest. [Para 30] Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – s.5A – Objections – If were effectively disposed – Owing to the similarities of contents and the fact that they pertained to the same parcel of land, several objections were disposed of by the Collector by a Common after grouping them together – High Court held that the objections were treated as an empty formality since the Collector disposed them by consolidating in groups: Held: Objections were classified because of the similarity of substance and thus, it was plausible to group them together and dispose of by way of a Common – Not doing so would lead to sheer wastage of time and energy that would be spent in duplicating the recommendations for each individual objection – Similar objections can be consolidated and the Collector need not undertake the daunting and unnecessary task of disposing of thousands of objections separately – Thus, High Court erroneously held that the objections were disposed of cryptically merely because they were grouped – Furthermore, some of the objections were left out from the aforementioned groups wherein the Collector noted that the objectors sought exemption of their land on the ground of it being an ‘abadi’ area – This plea was rejected albeit while 1004 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
