3. In a Letters Patent Appeal2 filed by the State of Gujarat, a Division Bench of the High Court found that the appellant had not been E allowed to resume her duties for no fault of hers. However, the Division Bench directed that the appellant shall not be entitled to any benefits for the period for which the resignation was in force. 4. The above narration indicates that the issue pertaining to the resignation of the appellant attained finality with the of the F Division Bench dated 22 February 2001. Evidently, the appellant had withdrawn her resignation prior to its acceptance. The subsequent of the Government accepting her resignation in December 1994 with effect from 31 March 1993 was of no consequence in law. The consequence of the decision of the High Court was that the resignation of the appellant from service which was withdrawn on 23 November G 1993 would not have any legal effect.

Subsequently on 17 July 2002, a similar was passed treating the period of resignation as unauthorized leave. 6. The two s dated 8 April 2002 and 17 July 2002 led to the C institution of fresh proceedings3 under Article 226 of the Constitution. By a dated 9 August 2004, a Single Judge of the High Court quashed and set aside both the above s dated 8 April 2002 and 17 July 2002. The respondents were directed to pay all the benefits for the period from 24 November 1993 till 30 March 2001 together with interest D at 9% from 22 February 2001. The amount was paid in 2004 and the interest element was paid in 2012. Significantly, the of the High Court dated 9 August 2004 attained finality. There was no appeal against the decision. 7. On 16 July 2005, a third was passed by the respondents E holding the following period as unauthorized leave and to be treated as a break in service, namely; (i) 21 June 1988 – 31 July 1988 - 41 days; (ii) 18 April 1993 – 23 November 1993 - 220 days; and (iii) 6 November 1991 – 7 April 1993 - 521 days F 8.
