Single Judge and Ld. Division Bench have reached opposite conclusions. According to the Ld. Single Judge, 01.11.2018 was to operate as the cut-off period only in so far as Clause (2) of Rule 9(1)(a) is concerned – that is to say eligibility in so far as age of the candidate is concerned. The date 01.11.2018 was not to be treated as the cut-off date for all the eligibility conditions set out in Rule 9. However, the Division Bench was of the opinion that 01.11.2018 operated as the cut-off date qua all the clauses found in Rule 9(1)(a). 24. If the Division Bench is right in its fi nding, then we need not enter into the follow-up question as to whether any disciplinary proceeding was pending/contemplated against Dinesh Singh, since, admittedly, as on 1.11.2018, even as per the appellant-State, no case was pending or contemplated against him. On the other hand, if we hold the cut-off date to be the date of consideration, then it needs to be further examined if there was any action contemplated against the Respondent as on that date. 25. We are of the view that Ld. Single Judge was correct in concluding that 01.11.2018 was meant only for the purpose of determining the age- related eligibility as provided for in Rule 9(1)(a)(ii). The cut off for the purpose of determining eligibility in so far as Rule 9(1)(a)(iii) has to be determined as on date of consideration. 26. The fi nding of the Division Bench to the contrary was on the premise that the subject rule in itself had provided for 01.11.2018 to operate STATE OF HARYANA AND OTHERS v. DINESH SINGH 1057 AND ANOTHER [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] as the cut-off date qua all conditions of eligibility found in Rule 9. The relevant observation of the High Court is extracted herein below – “the cut-off date, thus, has to be seen from the date which is provided in the rules, which would be 01.11.2018 as per Rule 9(1)(a)(iii) of the 2008 Rules, as the process was set into motion on 30.05.2019. It is, thus, does not lie in the mouth of the State as such to say that on account of the pending litigation and on account of the s of the Division Bench dated 21.08.2019 and 29.08.2019, a diff erent cut-off date would come into play and there was a distinction as such qua the names which had been sent later. The eligibility as such has to be seen as provided in the rule itself and fi nding of the learned Single Judge that the cut-off date is 12.07.2019 is based on a wrong presumption.’’ 27. As could be seen from the above, the Ld. Division Bench opines that the cut-off date has to be seen from the date provided in the Rules, which according to it, is 01.11.2018. Rule 9(1)(a)(iii) does not contain any such date; it merely provides that a candidate facing disciplinary proceedings or against whom action is contemplated becomes ineligible for selection.
