It is therefore submitted that, since a general reference is made, the present case would not be a case of ‘legislation by incorporation’ but would be a case of ‘legislation by reference’. 16. Learned counsel submits that in any case, the Respondents Nos.1 and 2 have a good case on merits. He submits that the learned Single Judge of the High Court has not considered the merits of the matter and in the event this Court holds that the learned Single Judge was not justified in quashing the proceedings, the matter be remitted to the learned Single Judge of the High Court for deciding it afresh on merits. 17. Shri Vikas Mehta, learned Advocate on Record for the Appellant- Board, in rejoinder, reiterated the submissions made by Shri S.V. Raju, learned ASG. He submits that the legislative intent is clear. If the legislature wanted to take out the offences punishable under the Code from the ambit of Chapter XXVIII of the Companies Act, 2013, nothing prevented it from making an amendment to the Code itself. III. CONSIDERATION OF STATUTORY PROVISIONS 18. For considering the rival submissions, it will be necessary to refer to Section 236(1) of the Code, which reads thus: 7 [1962] 3 SCR 786 8 [1971] 2 SCR 92 : (1970) 2 SCC 820 9 [1989] 1 SCR 344 : (1989) 3 SCC 488 10 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 236.

It can thus be seen that Section 236(1) of the Code begins with a non-obstante clause. It provides that the offences under the Code shall be tried by the Special Court established under Chapter XXVIII of the Companies Act, 2013. Chapter XXVIII of the Companies Act, 2013 deals with ‘Special Courts’. 20. For appreciating the rival submissions, it will also be necessary to refer to Section 435 of the Companies Act, 2013, as it was originally enacted; Section 435 after the amendment in 2015 by the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2015, which came into effect from 29th May 2015 (hereinafter referred to as “the 2015 Amendment”); and Section 435 as it existed after the amendment by the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017 with effect from 7th May 2018 (hereinafter referred to as “the 2018 Amendment”), which reads thus: Section 435 (originally enacted) “435. Establishment of Special Courts.—(1) The Central Government may, for the purpose of providing speedy trial of offences punishable under this Act, by notification, establish or designate as many Special Courts as may be necessary. (2) A Special Court shall consist of a Single Judge who shall be appointed by the Central Government with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court within whose jurisdiction the judge to be appointed is working. (3) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a Judge of a Special Court unless he is, immediately before such appointment, holding office of a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge.” Section 435 (after the 2015 Amendment) “435.
