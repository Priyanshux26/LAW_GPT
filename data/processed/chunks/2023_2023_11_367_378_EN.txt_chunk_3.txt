The arbitrator’s appointment was within the knowledge of the department, which was represented through the government pleader. 9. Learned counsel pointed out to specifi c fi ndings of the Arbitrator on aspects such as delay on the part of the Engineer in handing over the site; delay in handing over drawings and deciding technical issues; shortage in cement supply; release of waters into the canal which impeded the work and their duration; shortage of fi nances and funds for timely release of interim payments; unabsorbed overheads or loss of profi t. It was pointed out that the arbitrator did not allow all these claims but was discerning in the fi ndings, in allowing them partially. Counsel pointedly referred to the contractor’s claim mentioned in the letter written to the EE on 23.09.1988. That led to the rejection of the initial claim, which resulted in an appeal to the Superintending Engineer which proved futile. It is pointed out that the overheads were standing charges and increased for all the work beyond the stipulated period, which had to be compensated. The main subheads of this 7 1988 [3] SCR 351. 372 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. claim included salaries of supervisory staff ; camp establishment; interest of borrowed capital; stationery; postage; cost of tools and plants; extra cost for maintenance of labour camps; water supply; medical aid; remobilization of labour; restarting machinery and plants after every working season; uncovered advances from piece rate workers and skilled labourers; charges towards security of the colony, camp etc. and extra wear and tear of tyres and tubes, etc. 10. It is pointed out that all these claims were duly taken into account, and the fi ndings of the High Court that the arbitrator travelled beyond the claim and the contract was without factual basis. Regarding the sum granted with respect to the stoppage of work during the release of canal, the arbitrator took into account the actual period based upon the evidence produced (C55 and C57), the duration was between 23.08.1987 to 15.10.1987 and 20.07.1988 to 28.08.1988 and between 10.03.1989 to 02.07.1989. It was pointed out that the arbitrator found that the department had released waters in the Kharif and Rabi weather without notice. Furthermore, not only was it impossible to carry on work during the release of water it was not possible even for a limited duration after that during the canal drying up process, which entailed some time. 11. Learned counsel urged the court to interfere with the fi ndings arguing that the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to interfere with the factual fi ndings and in the award as also on the interpretation placed by the Arbitrator, to the terms of the contract to be considered within the narrow confi nes of what is legitimately “legal misconduct”. 12. Mr. Rahul Chitnis, appearing for the state, urged that the fi nal bill was prepared on 14.12.1992 and was paid on 31.12.1992. It was accepted under protest. However, notice was given under clause 54A of the agreement dated 23.09.1988, and thereafter, appeal was fi led before Superintending Engineer.
