Explanation.— An agreement or compromise which is void or voidable under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872), shall not be deemed to be lawful within the meaning of this rule. 3A. Bar to suit.—No suit shall lie to set aside a decree on the ground that the compromise on which the decree is based was not lawful.” 11. This Court in Banwari Lal v. Chando Devi 2 has laid down the law on the disposal of a proceeding in accordance with a compromise between the parties and on recall of a compromise decree. It held that under 23, Rule 3, the Court must be satisfied upon applying judicial mind that the agreement between the parties is lawful before accepting the same and disposing the suit. Further, the proviso and the Explanation to 23, Rule 3 mandate that the court must “decide the question” of whether an adjustment or satisfaction has been arrived at, and it is clarified that void and voidable agreements under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 3 shall be deemed to be not lawful.4 Upon such reading of the provision, it held that the court recording the compromise can examine the legality of the agreement, in accordance with the provisions of the Contract Act, even after the compromise decree is passed and when a party moves an application for recall.5 2 [1992] Supp. 3 SCR 524 : (1993) 1 SCC 581 3 Hereinafter “the Contract Act”. 4 Banwari Lal (supra), paras 11-13. 5 ibid, para 14. 460 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 12. The law on the issue is summarised in Pushpa Devi Bhagat v. Rajinder Singh.6 In this case, the Court also took note of Section 96(3) of the CPC7 and the deletion of 43, Rule 1(m) of the CPC by way of an amendment in 1976, as well as 23, Rule 3A. The consequence of these is that an appeal against a consent decree and an recording (or refusing to record) a compromise is not maintainable, nor can a fresh suit be filed for setting aside such decree. Hence, the only remedy available to the aggrieved party is to approach the court that recorded the compromise under the proviso to 23, Rule 3. The Court held: “17. The position that emerges from the amended provisions of 23 can be summed up thus: (i) No appeal is maintainable against a consent decree having regard to the specific bar contained in Section 96(3) CPC. (ii) No appeal is maintainable against the of the court recording the compromise (or refusing to record a compromise) in view of the deletion of clause (m) of Rule 1 43. (iii) No independent suit can be filed for setting aside a compromise decree on the ground that the compromise was not lawful in view of the bar contained in Rule 3-A. (iv) A consent decree operates as an estoppel and is valid and binding unless it is set aside by the court which passed the consent decree, by an on an application under the proviso to Rule 3 23.
