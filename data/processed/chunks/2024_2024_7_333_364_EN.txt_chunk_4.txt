The statements of Sachin Garg[kidnapped boy(PW-2)] and Mahesh Garg[(Father of the kidnapped boy(PW-1)] were recorded by Investigating Officer(PW-37) on 20th April, 2003. 7. Mahesh Garg(PW-1) stated that on 2nd April 2003, his son Sachin Garg had gone to play badminton at the playground of Sector 7, Panchkula, in a car, but he did not return till 9:00 pm. Thereupon, he along with his family members made efforts to trace Sachin Garg out. He received calls from Mobile Nos. 9815XXXXXX and 9815XXXXXX and the caller(s) informed them that Sachin Garg(PW-2) was in their custody and demanded ransom to the tune of Rs. 1 crore for his release. The caller(s) also threatened that in case, the ransom demand was not satisfied, Sachin Garg would be eliminated. A threat was also given to eliminate the entire family in case any intimation was given to the police. 8. Fearing for the life of his son, Mahesh Garg(PW-1) arranged money from his relatives, friends and his own bank accounts. He again received calls on 3rd April, 2003 threatening him not to inform the police. He was further directed to reach a designated place with the ransom amount and to wait for further instructions. Accordingly, he took the ransom amount to the address given by the miscreants i.e. Sector 17, Chandigarh, thereafter, to Sector 8, Chandigarh and ultimately to PGI hospital. On reaching there, he received another call and was directed to leave the bag with the ransom amount in his car and to proceed to the emergency ward of the hospital and wait for further instructions. Accordingly, he left the briefcase containing the money in the car and proceeded to the emergency ward of PGI hospital. However, he did not find anyone present there. After some time, he received another call 340 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports asking him to leave the place and wait for another call with the assurance that his son would be released along with the car after the cash amount had been counted and verified. He received another call by which he was informed that his car was parked near the chowk of Sector 11/15, Chandigarh. Accordingly, he took the car and proceeded to his house. At about 10:30 pm, another call was received informing him that his son Sachin Garg(PW-2) was standing near the chowk of Sector 20, Panchkula. He brought Sachin Garg(PW-2) back home from that place. He again received a call threatening that if any attempt was made to inform the police, then the entire family would be eliminated. Thus, out of fear, they did not approach the police. 9.
