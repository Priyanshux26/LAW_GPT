In the facts and circumstances of the present case, the proviso in Clause (65) of the general conditions of the contract cannot be taken to be the agreement between the parties so as to apply the provisions of the amended Act. As per Section E 26 of the Act, the provisions of the Amendment Act, 2015 shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of the Amendment Act, 2015 (w.e.f. 23-10-2015). In the present case, arbitration proceedings commenced way back in 2013, much prior to coming into force of the amended Act and therefore, provisions of the amended Act F cannot be invoked. 17. In BCCI v. Kochi Cricket (P) Ltd. [(2018) 6 SCC 287], this Court has held that the provisions of the Amendment Act, 2015 (with effect from 23-10-2015) cannot have retrospective operation in the arbitral proceedings already commenced unless the parties G otherwise agree and held as under : …………………………..” 4.9 It is submitted that it is a settled law that arbitration commences upon invocation of the notice as per Section 21 of the Act, 1996. It is H 342 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A submitted that therefore, in a case where the notice invoking the arbitration has been issued prior to the Amendment Act, 2015, on true interpretation of Section 26 read with Section 21 of the Amendment Act, 2015, the Amendment Act, 2015 shall not be applicable and the arbitration would be governed by the unamended provision. B 4.10 Making above submissions and relying upon the decisions of this Court in the case of Parmar Construction Company (supra); Pradeep Vinod Construction Company (supra) and S.P. Singla Constructions Private Limited (supra), it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal. C 5. We have heard learned counsel for the respective parties at length. The short question which is posed for the consideration of this Court is, in relation to the arbitration proceedings, in a case where the notice invoking arbitration is issued prior to the Amendment Act, 2015, the old Act shall be applicable (pre-amendment 2015) or the new Act? D 6. While considering the aforesaid issue the relevant provisions of the Amendment Act, 2015 are required to be referred to, namely, Sections 11(6A), 21 and 26, which are as under: “(6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, E while considering any application under sub-section (4) or sub- section (5) or sub-section (6), shall, notwithstanding any , decree or of any Court, confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. 21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings – Unless otherwise F agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent. 26. Act not to apply to pending arbitral proceedings – Nothing G contained in this Act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act, before the commencement of this Act unless the parties otherwise agree but this Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of this Act.” H M/S.
