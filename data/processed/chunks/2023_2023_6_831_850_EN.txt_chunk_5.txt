20. Having considered the matter, this Court does not find any merit in the present appeal. To begin with, the dated 04.02.2019, B passed by the Revenue Court, was never assailed by the appellants herein. Thus, the relationship of the tenant-landlord is not disputed. Moreover, though the respondent no.1 had filed the case for recovery of lease rent for Fasli(s) No. 1419 to 1424 @ 10½ bags of paddy for each year, each bag weighing 65 kgs. ; ultimately the passed by the Revenue Court on 04.02.2019 was in the form of a direction to the appellants to pay 31½ C bags of paddy or its equivalent amount to the respondents for Fasli(s) No. 1421, 1423 and 1424. As noted above, the substantive dated 04.02.2019, having never been assailed, has attained finality. Even upon receiving copy of the dated 04.02.2019 on 10.10.2020, compliance was not made within two months i.e., by 09.12.2020. D 21. At this juncture, the Court would pause to indicate that merely by the appellants sending a Legal Notice on 06.11.2020, calling upon the respondent no.1 to come and collect the rent would not, ipso facto, discharge their onus, in law, to pay. The appellants could not have called upon the respondents via a Legal Notice to come and collect the rent as, E simply stated, they were obliged in law, having not assailed the dated 04.02.2019, to pay and, if for any reason the respondent no.1, either due to non-availability or resistance/refusal to receive/accept the same, the dated 04.02.2019 had clearly provided that either 31½ bags of paddy or the amount equivalent thereto could easily have been deposited before the Revenue Court; as ultimately is stated to have been F done by the appellants, though belatedly, on 18.02.2021. 22.
