Against the dated 23.06.2006, the claim petitioners filed E appeals in C.A. Nos. 3327-3331 of 2014 before this Court. When the appeals came up for hearing before this Court, it was noticed by this Court that one of the Judges of the Division Bench (Justice B.Seshasayana Reddy) which passed the impugned therein, had earlier passed an , while he was a District Judge, Ranga Reddy District in favor of the claim petitioners.

(Civil) Diary No. 40990 of 2018. The grievance projected by these persons against the of the High Court dated 14.03.2018 was that by categorizing the appeals and applications for hearing, the High Court was likely to reopen even the appeals already disposed of. C 85. This Special Leave Petition was disposed of by this Court on 16.11.2018 at the stage of admission itself, without ing notice to the respondents. The reads as follows: “Delay condoned. D Mr. Gopal Shankarnarayan, learned counsel, submits that the High Court is likely to reopen even those second appeals, which had already been disposed of. The apprehension of. is based on the following observation made by the High court in the impugned : - E “All the writ petitions falling under category-XIII and XIV will be taken up for hearing from 10th April 2018 on a day- today basis on a specific understanding that the learned Government Pleader will get ready to argue the writ petitions from 10th April 2018 onwards. For the F purpose of convenience, the cause list will be printed as such without any modification, since the learned counsel appearing on all sides today have had the benefit of the memo filed by the Receivers-cum Commissioners and it is up to them to come prepared with respect to the cases that fall under these categories.” G It is made clear that the execution will pertain only to those writ petitions which have otherwise survived on account of the remand.
