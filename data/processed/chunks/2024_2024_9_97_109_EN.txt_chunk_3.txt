6. It was thereafter that the appellant along with letter dated 04.06.2019, sent a cheque dated 01.06.2019 for Rs. 3,43,178/- and again requested for confirmation of the date of possession. The ADA encashed the said cheque but did not inform any date for handing over possession. It looks like the appellant got the loan transferred to the State Bank of India4 whereupon the SBI is writing letters demanding the title deed of the apartment vide communications dated 14.03.2017, 25.06.2019 and 19.10.2019. These communications further mention that in case the title deed is not deposited, then penal interest @2% p.a. would be levied. The appellant again reiterated his earlier request for waiver of interest on balance amount vide reminder dated 18.09.2019 and 4 SBI 102 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports again requested for confirmation whether the flat was ready for physical possession. The appellant again visited the office of ADA on 23.11.2019 and requested for completion certificate and firefighting clearance certificate, which were not provided. He again visited the site and found that the apartment was not in a habitable condition. The appellant thus proceeded to institute a complaint before the NCDRC on 10.07.2020 alleging deficiency in service as also unfair trade practice on the part of ADA. 7. The ADA filed its reply in which the amounts as deposited by the appellant, as noted above, were admitted. Further, according to ADA, the construction was ready and possession was offered on 04.02.2014 along with demand of Rs. 3,43,178/- which the appellant did not pay and continued to claim for waiver of interest and had ultimately paid the said amount on 04.06.2019 vide cheque dated 01.06.2019. According to ADA, after adjustment there was still an outstanding amount of Rs. 4,71,159/- as on 05.02.2021. It was also stated in the written statement that in 2011, at the time of allotment, the tentative price was Rs. 56,54,000/- and under Clause 45 of the Registration and Allotment Rules, it was clearly mentioned that the price could vary upto 10%. Further, according to ADA, the demand raised by the letter dated 04.02.2014 of solar system, lease premium and car parking were apart from the cost of the flat and not due to increased cost. The appellant had unnecessarily delayed payment of the demand raised on 04.02.2014. It was also stated in the written statement that out of the 582 apartments built under the project in question, except for 20 allottees, all other allottees had taken possession. The ADA further pleaded that the complaint was barred by time and secondly, that as the total payment made by the appellant was Rs. 59,97,178/-, as such it would not fall within the pecuniary limit of the NCDRC, and therefore, the complaint was liable to be dismissed for the above two reasons also. 8. The parties led their evidence. The NCDRC rejected technical objections raised by the ADA regarding limitation as also the pecuniary jurisdiction. In so far as the limitation is concerned, the NCDRC held that as subsequent demand and reminders were sent by the ADA and the ADA even accepted the cheque of Rs.
