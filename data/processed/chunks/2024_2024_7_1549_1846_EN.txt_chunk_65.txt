Under the MMDR Act, a “prospecting licence” is granted for the purpose of undertaking prospecting operations.117 Prospecting operations are defined to mean any operations undertaken for the 112 Section 2(6), Registration Act 1908 113 State of Karnataka v. Subhash Rukmayya Guttedar, (1993) Supp. 3 SCC 290 [6]; Sri Tarkeshwar Sio Thakur jiu v. Dar Dass Dey (1979) 3 SCC 106 [37] 114 Section 52, Indian Easements Act 1882 115 [1960] 1 SCR 368, [28]. [“28. […] The following propositions may, therefore, be taken as well established: (1) To ascertain whether a document creates a licence or lease, the substance of the document must be preferred to the form; (2) the real test is the intention of the parties – whether they intended to create a lease or a licence; (3) if the document creates an interest in the property, it is a lease; but, if it only permits another to make use of the property, of which the legal possession continues with the owner, it is a licence; and (4) if under the document a party gets exclusive possession of the property, prima facie, he is considered to be a tenant; but circumstances may be established which negative the intention to create a lease.”] 116 Mangal Amusement Park Private Ltd. v. State of Madhya Pradesh (2012) 11 SCC 713 [15] 117 Section 3(g), MMDR Act 1634 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports purpose of exploring, locating, or proving a mineral deposit.118 Chapter III of the Mineral Concession Rules 1960 deals with the grant of prospecting licences in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the government. Form F contained in the Mineral Concession Rules 1960 states that under a prospecting licence, the State Government grants to the licesee the sole rights to enter upon lands and to search, win, carry away or dispose of minerals won. Rule 14 read with Schedule III allows the prospecting licensee to win and carry away a limited quantity of minerals in lieu of the payment of specified royalty. Under a prospecting licence, the licensee does not get an interest in the land or in the minerals contained therein. The licensee is only allowed to carry away a limited quantity of minerals after payment of specified royalty.119 Even a prospecting licensee has to pay royalty to the State Government for carrying away the minerals won during prospecting operations. 87. A “mining lease” is defined under the MMDR Act to mean a lease granted for the purpose of undertaking mining operations and includes a sub-lease granted for such purpose.120 The expression “mining operations” has been defined to mean any operations undertaken for the purpose of winning any mineral. The expression “winning” has been explained by this Court to mean getting or extracting minerals from the mines.121 In Sri Tarkeshwar Sio Thakur Jiu v. Dar Dass Dey & Co,122 Justice R S Sarkaria observed that the expression “mining operations” is expansive, so as to comprehend every activity by which the mineral is extracted or obtained from the earth irrespective of whether such activity is carried out on the surface or in the bowels of the earth.
