(Para 67) d. Moratorium under Section 14, IBC only applies to the Corporate Debtor and does not apply to natural persons C mentioned under Section 141 of NI Act, 1881. The said conclusion is reached after considering Aneeta Hada v. Godfather Travels & Tours (P) Ltd., (2012) 5 SCC 661. (Para 102) e. I quote para 102 of P. Mohanraj (supra) as under: D “102. Since the corporate debtor would be covered by the moratorium provision contained in Section 14 IBC, by which continuation of Sections 138/141 proceedings against the corporate debtor and initiation of Sections 138/141 proceedings against the said debtor during the corporate insolvency resolution process are interdicted, what is stated E in paras 51 and 59 in Aneeta Hada ((2012) 5 SCC 661) would then become applicable. The legal impediment contained in Section 14 IBC would make it impossible for such proceeding to continue or be instituted against the corporate debtor. Thus, for the period of moratorium, since no Sections 138/141 F proceeding can continue or be initiated against the corporate debtor because of a statutory bar, such proceedings can be initiated or continued against the persons mentioned in Sections 141(1) and (2) of the Negotiable Instruments Act. This being the case, it is clear that the moratorium provision contained in Section 14 IBC would apply only to the corporate G debtor, the natural persons mentioned in Section 141 continuing to be statutorily liable under Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act.” (Emphasis supplied) H 1024 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 46. While dealing with the issue of Section 14, IBC, this Court had the occasion to deal in detail with Section 32A also. The 2nd proviso to Section 32A(1) is a complete answer to the issue in question. The said provision is discussed in detail from Paras 39-43 in P. Mohanraj’s case. Paras 39 to 43 read thus: B “39. The raison d’être for the enactment of Section 32-A has been stated by the Report of the Insolvency Law Committee of February 2020, which is as follows: “17. LIABILITYOFCORPORATEDEBTORFOROFFENCESCOMMITTED PRIOR TO INITIATION OF CIRP [Recommendations contained C herein have been implemented pursuant to Section 10 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019.] 17.1. Section 17 of the Code provides that on commencement of the CIRP, the powers of management of the corporate debtor vest with the interim resolution D professional. Further, the powers of the Board of Directors or partners of the corporate debtor stand suspended, and are to be exercised by the interim resolution professional. Thereafter, Section 29-A, read with Section 35(1)(f), places restrictions on related parties of the corporate debtor from E proposing a resolution plan and purchasing the property of the corporate debtor in the CIRP and liquidation process, respectively. Thus, in most cases, the provisions of the Code effectuate a change in control of the corporate debtor that results in a clean break of the corporate debtor from its erstwhile management. However, the legal form of F the corporate debtor continues in the CIRP, and may be preserved in the resolution plan.
