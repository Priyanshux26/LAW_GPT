The said quantity of physical refi ned RBO and the balance quantity of RBO (19,939.40 quintals) was sold within the State of Uttar Pradesh for Rs. 45,91,66,611 and Rs. 9,60,11,540 respectively aggregating to a total of Rs. 55,51,78,151/-. The assessee’s tax liability on the said sales was calculated at Rs. 2,77,58,908/-. 7. On the basis of the statutory provisions of Section 13(1)(a) read with S. No. 2(ii) of the Table appended thereto and Section 13(3)(b) read with Explanation (iii) to Section 13 of the UP VAT Act, the assessee claimed full amount of tax paid as ITC i.e., a sum of Rs. 4,68,47,670/-. The claim of the assessee came to be rejected vide the of the Deputy Commissioner, Tax Fixation, Div. – I, Pilibhit passed in terms of Section 28(2)(i) of the UP VAT Act. It is the case of the revenue that had the assessee been permitted to avail the full ITC, it would have led to a loss of Rs. 1,90,88,763.00 to the State exchequer. 8. In connection with both the Assessment Years i.e. 2013-14 and 2015- 16, respectively vide two separate s, the Deputy Commissioner took the view that in terms of Section 13(1)(f), the assessee could have availed the ITC on the inputs only vis-à-vis the taxable sales, as the sale price of the fi nal goods was lesser than the manufacturing cost of the purchased goods. M/S MODI NATURALS LTD. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF 751 COMMERCIAL TAX UP [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] In other words, according to the Deputy Commissioner the term “goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act means only the taxable goods. The matter ultimately reached before the Additional Commissioner Grade II, (Appeals), 2nd Commercial Tax, Bareilly. The Incharge Additional Commissioner for the Assessment Year 2015-16 took the view that the assessee was entitled to claim full ITC and accordingly allowed the appeal of the assessee. The Incharge Additional Commissioner accepted the case put up by the assessee that the word “goods” in Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act cannot be restricted to only “taxable goods”. However, for the Assessment Year 2013- 14, the Additional Commissioner proceeded to remand the matter to the Tax Fixation offi cer for passing the re-tax fi xation . 9. The revenue being dissatisfi ed with the view taken by the Additional Commissioner went in appeal before the Commercial Tax Tribunal, Bareilly Bench, Bareilly in so far as the Assessment Year 2015-16 is concerned. We may clarify that so far as the Assessment Year 2013-14 is concerned, it was the assessee who had to go before the Commercial Tax Tribunal by way of a second appeal as the Additional Commissioner had allowed the appeal fi led by the assessee and had remanded the matter to the Tax Fixation Offi cer. 10. Although the Commercial Tax Tribunal passed two separate s with respect to the two assessment years referred to above, yet the issues between the parties remained common. Ultimately, it is the revenue who went before the High Court with two Commercial Tax Revision Applications being the Revision No.
