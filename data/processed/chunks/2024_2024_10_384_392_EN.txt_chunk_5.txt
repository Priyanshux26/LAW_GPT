This was the position in the decision of this Court in V Nagarajan. 20. The facts of the present case are completely distinguishable. The free copy was made available on 14 November 2023 after the decision of the NCLT was pronounced on 30 October 2023. The appeal was lodged on 2 December 2023. The appeal was lodged with a delay of only three days beyond the statutory period of 30 days and, therefore, fell within the condonable period of 15 days. Sufficient cause was shown for condoning the delay of three days. 21. A Schedule of Fees is prescribed by the NCLT Rules. Entry 31 of the Schedule stipulates that the fee for obtaining true certified copies of final s passed to parties other than the concerned parties under Rule 50 shall be Rupees five per page. The stipulation of Rupees five per page in Entry 31 excludes “the concerned parties under Rule 50”. 392 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 22.
