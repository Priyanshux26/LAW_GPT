A 2.3 Even otherwise, the High Court has materially erred in entertaining the writ petition preferred by the respondent No. 1 herein. As per the case on behalf of the appellant and so stated in the counter affidavit, the respondent No. 1 – original writ petitioner was not the recorded owner and he filed the writ petition on the basis of some documents – General Power of Attorney, receipts etc. As held by this B Court in the case of Shiv Kumar and Anr. Vs. Union of India and Ors., (2019) 10 SCC 229 and in the subsequent decisions in the case of Delhi Development Authority Vs. Godfrey Philips (I) Ltd. & Ors., - Civil Appeal No. 3073 of 2022 and Delhi Administration Thr. Secretary, Land and Building Department & Ors. Vs. Pawan C Kumar & Ors., - Civil Appeal No. 3646 of 2022, the subsequent purchaser has no locus to challenge the acquisition / lapse of acquisition. Under the circumstances also, the High Court has committed a very serious error in entertaining the writ petition preferred at the instance of respondent No. 1 – original writ petitioner.
