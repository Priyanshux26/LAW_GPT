(5) The period referred to in sub-rule (2) may be extended for a period not exceeding sixty days by the registering authority for reasons to be recorded in writing. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1309 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 migrants in large numbers is not lost to the Court and is a matter of serious concern. The State must effectively create adequate state capacity to deal with undocumented migrants who migrated after the cut-off date prescribed by Section 6A as well as those who have migrated before the cut-off date but who do not fulfill the conditions for the grant of citizenship under the provision. 120. In view of the above discussion, I am unable, with respect, to agree with the observation of my learned brother, Justice Pardiwala that the purpose of Section 6A(3) is merely the speedy and effective identification of foreigners of the 1966-71 stream. The principle of temporal unreasonableness cannot be applied to a situation where the classification is still relevant to the objective of the provision. The process of detection and conferring citizenship in Assam is a long-drawn out process spanning many decades. To strike it down due to lapse of time is to ignore the context and object of the provision. vi. Section 6A(2) cannot be held unconstitutional for not prescribing a procedure for registration 121. The petitioners submitted that Section 6A(2) is unconstitutional because the provision does not prescribe a procedure for conferring citizenship to those who migrated before 1 January 1966, unlike Section 6A(3) which prescribes a procedure for conferring citizenship to those who migrated between 1966-1971. 122. Section 6A is a substantive provision conferring citizenship on persons who migrated from Bangladesh to Assam. The provision provides that persons who migrated from Bangladesh to Assam before 1 January 1966 shall deemed to be citizens of India from 1 January 1966. The import of the use of the legal fiction is that the law assumes a fact that does not exist.218 123. The provisions of the Citizenship Act do not require every person to register to acquire citizenship. Sections 5 and 6 of the Citizenship Act provide for acquiring citizenship through registration and 218 See Justice GP Singh, Principles of Statutory Interpretation (15th edition, Lexis Nexis), 294; JK Cotton Spinning & Weaving Mills Ltd. V. Union of India, AIR 1988 SC 191 1310 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports naturalisation. These two provisions require the applicant to follow a process of application. 124. However, Sections 3 and 4 of the Act do not require registration for acquiring citizenship. Section 3 deals with citizenship by birth. Section 4 deals with Citizenship by descent. The law does not mandate that persons who are covered in the categories prescribed by Sections 3 and 4 must register to acquire citizenship. Thus, registration is not the de-facto model of securing citizenship in India. The use of the deeming fiction obviates the need for registration. Any person : (a) of Indian origin who migrated from Bangladesh to Assam before 1 January 1966; and (b) who has ordinarily been a resident in Assam since their date of entry is deemed to be a citizen of India.
