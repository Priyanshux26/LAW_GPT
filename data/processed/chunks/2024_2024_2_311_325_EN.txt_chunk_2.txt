The 100% equity shares of M/s Kadam were held by Shipra Estate Limited (98%); Mohit Singh (1%) and Bindu Singh (1%). 5. Between 2017-2020, IHFL had sanctioned 16 loan facilities to the tune of Rs. 2,801 crores to the Shipra Group/ Borrowers comprising of Shipra Hotels Ltd., Shipra Estate Ltd. and Shipra Leasing Pvt. Ltd. for the purposes of the construction and/or development of Housing/Residential Projects. Against the said sanctioned loan, a sum of approximately 1995.37 crores was disbursed. The financial assistance was secured by the Shipra Group by executing 22 pledge agreements whereby the shares of various companies were pledged in favour of IHFL. A pledge agreement was also entered into by Shipra Groups and M/s Kadam with IHFL pledging 100% equity shares (dematerialized) of M/s Kadam to secure the loan. The mortgaged properties also included 73 acres of land at Noida that had been sub-let to M/s Kadam by YEIDA, and the property called ‘Shipra Mall’ in Ghaziabad. 6. There being defaults in the repayment of loan amount, IHFL had issued notices recalling all the loans advanced to the Shipra Group amounting to Rs. 1763 crores (approx.). The said notices came to be challenged by the Shipra Group before the Delhi High Court, by filing FAO(OS) COMM 59/2021. The Delhi High Court vide dated 16.04.2021 recorded that IHFL could proceed further with the recovery proceedings, however the sale of shares should be done [2024] 2 S.C.R. 315 Directorate of Enforcement v. Niraj Tyagi & Ors. at a fair market value and in a transparent manner. It appears that a series of litigations under the SARFAESI Act before the DRT and High Court had ensued between the parties. 7. IHFL on 01.07.2021 ultimately sold the shares of M/s Kadam pledged with it to one Final Step Developers P. Ltd., a subsidiary of M3M India P. Ltd. for Rs. 750 crores. Since Final Step Developers (earlier known as M/s Creative Soul Technology P. Ltd) had no source of funds of its own, the funds to purchase the shares of M/s Kadam were provided to the Final Step Developers by the M3M India, which managed to take loan from the IHFL on the same day i.e. 03.07.2021. Thus, the purchase of shares of M/s Kadam by Final Step from the IHFL was funded by the IHFL itself. The mortgaged properties-Shipra Mall at Ghaziabad and the parcel of law admeasuring 73 acres at Noida also eventually came to be sold by the IHFL towards the recovery of its dues from the Shipra Group. 8. On 09.04.2023, an FIR being No. 427 of 2023 came to be filed by one Amit Walia, a Director of Shipra Hotels, against IHFL and its officers for the offences under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B IPC, 323, 504 & 506 at Police Station Indirapuram, alleging inter alia that IHFL had illegally showed the Shipra group to be the defaulters, so that they may misappropriate the properties owned by the Group through illegal means. The FIR also alleged that IHFL had conspired with M3M India, and by forging and fabricating the documents sold 73 acres of land of M/s Kadam to M3M India, for a sum of 300 crores when the market value of the same was about 4000 crores.
