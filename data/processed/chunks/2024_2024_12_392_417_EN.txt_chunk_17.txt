28.5 Furthermore, the offence occurred in a context of political rivalry, a factor that exacerbates its gravity. Crimes rooted in such motives often have far-reaching consequences beyond the immediate loss of life, contributing to social unrest and weakening public confidence in the rule of law. The Court must therefore ensure that its decisions reinforce the principle of accountability and deter the recurrence of such violent acts, particularly those that disrupt public . The medical evidence, corroborated by eyewitness testimony and the recovery of the weapon, leaves no room for doubt. While the Court acknowledges the appellant’s advanced age and medical condition, these factors cannot outweigh the need for justice and the imperative to uphold the rule of law. 28.6 In light of the above, while we empathize with the appellant’s personal circumstances, we find no compelling justification to interfere with the sentence imposed by the lower Court. The nature of the offence, its deliberate execution, and its societal implications necessitate that the punishment reflects the seriousness of the crime. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 417 Kunhimuhammed@Kunheethu v. The State of Kerala 29. Lastly, once conviction under Section 302 of IPC is confirmed by all the Courts, then the minimum sentence is imprisonment for life, as provided under the provision itself. Thus, no ground or reason for granting a lesser sentence arises. When the minimum sentence itself is life imprisonment, then grounds like parity, leniency, old age, health concerns, etc. shall not be of any aid to the accused while seeking reduction of sentence. Therefore, the appellant herein has been granted the minimum sentence for committing the offence of murder. 30. After thoroughly examining the appellant’s submissions and the evidence presented in the case, the Court concludes that the appeal against conviction and the request for a reduction in sentence are without merit. The findings of both the Trial Court and the High Court are well-founded and supported by compelling evidence. 31. The courts below have rightly concluded that the appellant’s actions amount to murder under Section 300, IPC and thus punishable under Section 302, IPC. Accordingly, the appeal for reduction of the sentence is dismissed. The conviction and sentence are upheld. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
