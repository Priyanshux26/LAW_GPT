54. Relying on the earlier s, this Court held that since the representation was left unattended for four months, the continued detention of the detenu was illegal. 55. In the case of Vijay Kumar vs. State of Jammu & Kashmir and others (supra), this Court observed thus: “13. ….There are two time-lags which may be noticed. Representation admittedly handed in to the Superintendent of Jail on July 29, 1981, at Jammu reached Srinagar, the summer capital of the State on August 12, 1981, which shows a time-lag of 14 days. The second time-lag is, from 346 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports our point of view, more glaring. Even though the concerned office was made aware of the fact by the wireless message of the Superintendent of Jail, Jammu, dated July 29, 1981, that a representation of the detenu has been sent by post, the first query about its non-receipt came as per the wireless message dated August 6, 1981. That can be overlooked, but it has one important message. The concerned office was aware of the fact that a representation has already been made and a duplicate was sent for. With the background of this knowledge trace the movement of the representation from the date of its admitted receipt being August 12, 1981. If the representation was received on August 12, 1981, and the same office disposed it of on August 31, 1981, there has been a time-lag of 19 days and the explanation in that behalf in the affidavit of Shri Salathia is far from convincing. In our opinion, in the facts of this case this delay, apart from being inordinate, is not explained on any convincing grounds.” 56. This Court found that the delay of 14 days in transmitting the representation from Jammu to Srinagar and 19 days in deciding the same vitiated the detention . 57. In the case of Aslam Ahmed Zahire Ahmed Shaik vs. Union of India and others (supra), this Court was again considering a similar factual scenario. The detenu had handed over the representation to the Superintendent of Central Prison on 16th June 1988, who callously ignored it and left the same unattended for a period of seven days and forwarded the same to the Government on 22nd June 1988. This Court surveyed the earlier decisions and observed thus: “5. This Court in Sk. Abdul Karim v. State of W.B. [(1969) 1 SCC 433] held: (SCC p. 439, para 8) “The right of representation under Article 22(5) is a valuable constitutional right and is not a mere formality.” 6. This view was reiterated in Rashid Sk. v. State of W.B. [(1973) 3 SCC 476 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 376] while dealing with the constitutional requirement of expeditious consideration of the petitioner's representation by the Government as [2024] 9 S.C.R. 347 Jaseela Shaji v. The Union of India & Ors. spelt out from Article 22(5) of the Constitution observing thus: (SCC p. 478, para 4) “The ultimate objective of this provision can only be the most speedy consideration of his representation by the authorities concerned, for, without its expeditious consideration with a sense of urgency the basic purpose of affording earliest opportunity of making the representation is likely to be defeated.
