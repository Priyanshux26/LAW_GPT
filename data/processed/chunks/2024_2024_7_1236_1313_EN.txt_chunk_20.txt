Thus, the emphasis was laid on the retention of the power by the Magistrate under Section 125 of the Code and the effect of ultimate consequence. 14. Slightly recently, in Shabana Bano v. Imran Khan [(2010) 1 SCC 666 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 216 : (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 873], a two-Judge Bench, placing reliance 1264 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports on Danial Latifi [(2001) 7 SCC 740 : (2007) 3 SCC (Cri) 266], has ruled that : (Shabana Bano case [(2010) 1 SCC 666 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 216 : (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 873], SCC p. 672, para 21) '21. The appellant’s petition under Section 125 CrPC would be maintainable before the Family Court as long as the appellant does not remarry. The amount of maintenance to be awarded under Section 125 CrPC cannot be restricted for the iddat period only.’ Though the aforesaid decision was rendered interpreting Section 7 of the Family Courts Act, 1984, yet the principle stated therein would be applicable, for the same is in consonance with the principle stated by the Constitution Bench in Khatoon Nisa [Khatoon Nisa v. State of U.P. (2014) 12 SCC 646 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 155 : (2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 170].’ In view of the aforesaid dictum, there can be no shadow of doubt that Section 125 CrPC has been rightly held to be applicable by the learned Family Judge.” 22. Before perusing the submissions made by the Counsel, it is paramount to also consider the bare text of the concerned provisions vis-à-vis their comparative dissection. Under Section 3 of the 1986 Act, the entitlements or rights of a divorced Muslim woman, wider than the ambit of maintenance, arise as against the obligations of her former husband emanating from their divorce. Per contra, under Section 125 of CrPC 1973, a woman seeking maintenance has to establish that she is unable to maintain herself. The right to seek maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC 1973 is invokable even during the sustenance of marriage and, thereby is not contingent upon divorce. 23. Another distinction vis-à-vis the aforementioned provisions, relates to the time period within which proceedings initiated thereunder are to be decided. While a petition moved under Section 3(2) of the 1986 Act is to be decided in regard to a husband’s liability under Section 3(1) of the 1986 Act within a period of one month, there is no such statutory time frame prescribed under Section 125 of CrPC 1973. However, there is an obligation to determine the interim maintenance within a period of 60 days while dealing with a petition under Section [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1265 Mohd. Abdul Samad v. The State of Telangana & Anr. 125 of CrPC 1973. Moreover, failure to comply with such passed under Section 3(2) of the 1986 Act may lead to issuance of a warrant for levying the amount of maintenance as directed under the said and may also sentence him to imprisonment till the payment is made or for a term which may extend to one year.
