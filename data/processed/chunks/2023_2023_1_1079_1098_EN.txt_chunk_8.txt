Since the pleadings in the complaint did not refer to the Pay , which was attached in the original along with the complaint, the developer’s reply too was silent on this aspect. This is evident from a bare reading of the reply to the complaint before the MRTP Commission D filed by the developer on 3rd February 2006. Likewise, the reply to the Notice of Enquiry, which was issued by the MRTP Commission, and filed by the developer (supported by affidavit dated 25th January 2007) also does not allude to the Pay . 22.In the previous proceedings before this court, in the E complainant’s appeal,7 this court’s , dated 29th April 2016 reads as follows: “The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the Demand Drafts furnished by the respondents have already been deposited before the MRTP Commission. The respondents F are free to move the Competition commission for withdrawal of the amount. We record the statement of the appellant that in case, such an attempt is made by the respondents, the appellant shall not object the withdrawal of the drafts/amounts”. G 23.In terms of the leave granted by this court, through that , the developer moved an application before the COMPAT, which issued the following directions on 18th May 2016: 7 Supra note 3. H 1090 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A “This is an application on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for release of Pay No. 885894 dated 30.04.2005 for Rs.4,53,750/- drawn in favour of Dr. (Mrs.) Manjeet Kaur Monga for revalidation thereof in the name of the legal representatives of Dr. (Mrs.) Manjeet Kaur Monga. B Shri Aditya Narain, learned counsel for the applicants states that his client will be satisfied if the pay deposited in 2005 is returned to his client for the purpose of renewal, if any, 1n accordance with. law. Learned counsel for the representatives of the original complainant says that she does not have any objection. C In view of the above, the application is allowed. The demand Draft No. 885894 dated 30.04.2005 lying in the registry of the Tribunal be returned to the applicants.” 24.These developments were part of the record, and the court D was aware of them as a consequence of which the final dated 18th July 2017, disposing of the civil appeals, noted these facts: “…During the course of hearing of the appeals another interesting point came up for consideration. It has been brought to the notice of this Court that when the builder E company, the appellant in the appeals arising out of SLP(C) Nos.10484-10485/2016, had taken the pay from the Citibank on 30.04.2005, the amount of Rs.4,53,750/- covered by the pay had actually been deducted from their current account. But at the same time, the amount had not been paid/ received by the payee. In the instant case, the account bolder F cancelled the pay and requested for re-credit of the amount and, accordingly, it is seen that the Citibank has re- credited the amount to the account only on 22.06.2016.
