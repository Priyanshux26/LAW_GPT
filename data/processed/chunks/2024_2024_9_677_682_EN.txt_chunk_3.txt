8. In reply to the aforesaid affidavit, no response was filed by the respondent-tenant, thereby the averments of affidavit remained undisputed that from March 2017 onwards, the respondent-tenant has not paid the rent till date thereby failing to comply with the dated 02.05.2014. Hence, the statement of default in compliance of passed by this Court remains uncontroverted. 9. In any rent proceeding, the Courts can always take the subsequent facts into consideration, which may be relevant. Here is a case where the respondent-tenant has failed to comply with the interim passed by this Court regarding payment of rent during the pendency of the appeal before this Court, and hence, is in default. In any proceeding of eviction of tenant on the ground of non-payment of rent, he is not only bound to offer the arrears of rent on account of non-payment of which eviction is sought for but also to pay the future rent regularly, either at the amount agreed between the parties 682 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports or as fixed by the Court. Even on failure to pay the rent during the pendency of the litigation also the tenant is bound to be evicted. 10. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the view that the case falls in that category where the respondent-tenant has failed to comply with the passed by this Court dated 02.05.2014, directing payment of rent at the rate of ₹4,000/- per month, from March 2017 onwards. Hence, the respondent-tenant, who is now represented through his legal representatives/heirs, is directed to be evicted forthwith. The present appeal is accordingly allowed setting aside the of the High Court. However, it is made clear that the appellant-landlady shall have right to recover the arrears of rent from the respondent-tenant as determined by this Court for the period of default by initiating appropriate proceedings, if so advised. Result of the Case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
