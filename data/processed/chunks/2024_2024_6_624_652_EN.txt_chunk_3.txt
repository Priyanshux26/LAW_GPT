1 and 2. 2. After the decree was varied by the Appellate Court, the appellant/ debtor applied for restitution by invoking Section 144 CPC. The Trial Court, Appellate Court and the second Appellate Court as well, under impugned have rejected the appellant/ debtor’s application for restitution inter alia on the ground that the original decree was modified to the extent of interest payable and the debtor not having deposited any amount in the court after the original decree and the property was put in auction, is not entitled to restitution. 3. Before proceeding to deal with the legal issue, few relevant facts need to be referred which are stated intra: 1 ‘CPC’ [2024] 6 S.C.R. 629 Bhikchand S/o Dhondiram Mutha (Deceased) Through Lrs. v. Shamabai Dhanraj Gugale (Deceased) Through Lrs. 3.1 Dhanraj, the husband of the original plaintiff - Shamabai Dhanraj Gugale advanced loan of Rs. 8,000/- to the original defendant – appellant/ debtor in the year 1969. Upon his failure to repay the debt, the original plaintiff instituted a Special Civil Suit No. 255 of 1972 for recovery of Rs. 10,880/- (Rs.8,000/- as principal amount + Rs. 2880/- as accrued interest) along with interest @ 12% per annum pendente lite and post decree and for other ancillary reliefs and costs. On 15.02.1982, the 4th Joint Civil Judge, Senior Division, Pune partly decreed the suit by awarding the principal amount; pre-suit accrued interest; pendente lite and further interest at the rate of 12% per annum till realization of the principal amount and costs. The original plaintiff-decree holder preferred appeal against rejection of part of the claim. In this appeal (C.A. No. 1293 of 1986), the debtor preferred cross objections. During the pendency of the above first appeal, the plaintiff-decree holder also preferred execution application which came to be transferred to the court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, Ahmednagar because the property belonging to the debtor against which the decretal amount was to be recovered fell within the jurisdiction of Ahmednagar court. A special Darkhast No. 100 of 1982 came to be filed in the Ahmednagar court on 20.09.1982. In these execution proceedings, the decree holder sought attachment and sale of the following properties of the debtor for satisfaction of the decree: (1) The land situate at Mauje Davtakli, Taluka Shevgaon, District Ahmednagar at Gut No. 72, admeasuring approximately 9 Hectares 55 Are.
