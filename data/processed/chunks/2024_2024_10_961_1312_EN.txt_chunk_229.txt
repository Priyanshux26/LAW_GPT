It was contended that the definition of ‘establishment’ was over-inclusive because it included tramways and omnibuses The Court rejected the argument on the ground that judicial deference must be shown in challenges dealing with economic policy.111 Thus, the observations of this Court in Ambica Mills (supra) on judicial deference to under-inclusive provisions must be read in light of the established position of this Court that it must defer in matters relating to economic policy.112 65. In Missouri Kansas & Texas Rly (supra), the constitutional validity of a Texas Statute113 imposing penalty on railroad companies for 107 194 US 297, 269 108 [1974] 3 SCR 760 : (1974) 4 SCC 656 [69] 109 [1974] 3 SCR 760 : (1974) 4 SCC 656 [56] […] “Mr Justice Holmes, in urging tolerance of under-inclusive classifications, stated that such legislation should not be disturbed by the Court unless it can clearly see that there is no fair reason for the law which would not require with equal force its extension to those whom it leaves untouched.” 110 [1974] 3 SCR 760 : (1974) 4 SCC 656 [64-67]; “64. Laws regulating economic activity would be viewed differently from laws which touch and concern freedom of speech and religion, voting, procreation, rights with respect to criminal procedure, etc.” 111 [1974] 3 SCR 760 : (1974) 4 SCC 656 [72]; Also see John Sebastian, Under inclusive Laws and Constitutional Remedies- An Exploration of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, Indian Law Review [Volume 7 Issue 3 (2023)] 112 Ugad Sugar Works Limited v. Delhi Administration (2001) 3 SCC 635; State of Tamil Nadu v. National South Indian River Inter-linking,(2021) 15 SCC 534 113 Fourteenth Amendment of chapter 117 of the Laws of Texas of 1901 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1279 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 permitting the spread of Johnson grass and Russian thistle was challenged. The law was challenged on the ground that it was under-inclusive since it only penalised railroad companies to the exclusion of others. Justice Holmes writing for the majority of the US Supreme Court observed that Court should interfere only when there is no fair reason for the under-inclusion. The Court then identified numerous reasons for why the Railway Company may be singled out when compared to owners of farms who have an element of self-interest.114 Thus, Missouri Kansas & Texas Rly (supra) is also not an authority for the proposition that the scope of judicial review for under-inclusive law is limited. 66. The degree of judicial deference to any provision, including under- inclusive provisions depends on the subject matter of the case. In Joseph Shine v. Union of India,115 the constitutional validity of Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 was challenged on the ground of violation of Articles 14 and 15. Section 497 defined the offence of adultery as when a person has sexual intercourse with a woman, whom he knows or has reason to believe to be the wife of another man, without the consent of that man.
