Therefore, according to the learned ASG, the findings as recorded by the Tribunal and confirmed by the High Court are in conformity with the said letter. We have perused the Circular dated 14.6.2006, and on going through the same, it is clear that the Ministry of Railways through the Railway Board has laid down that “in case where an employee has been medically invalidated/de-categorised and where the administration cannot find alternative posts for such an employee, he may be kept on a supernumerary post in the grade in which he was working on regular basis till such time suitable post can be identified or till his retirement, whichever is earlier.” It was decided that a medically de-categorized employee may be retired voluntarily and be allowed to work on supernumerary post. In the same Circular in paragraphs 4 and 5, the directions have been issued as under: “4. Pursuant to the demand raised by staff side the issue has been deliberated upon at length in the full Board Meeting and it has been decided that compassionate ground appointment to the wife/wards/ depended of partially medically de-categorized staff who seeks voluntary retirement may be given subject to the following provisions: - a) The appointment will be given only in the eligible group ‘D’ categories. ‘Eligible’ would mean that in case group ‘D’ recruitment is banned for any particular category, the same would also apply for the compassionate ground appointments. b) Such an appointment should only be given in case of employees who are declared partially de-categorized at a time when they have at least 5 years or more service left. c) CMD of the Railways should keep a watch over the trend of de- categorization so that the present figures do not get inflated. CMD should also get 10% partially de-categorized cases re-examined by another medically Board not belonging to Divisional Hospital which initially declared them unfit. 154 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 5. All those employees medically de-categorized after issuance of Board’s letter No. E(NG)II/95/RC-1/14 dated 18.01.2000 will also be covered under these instructions. However, such cases which have already been finalized in terms of Board’s letters No. E(NG) II/95/ RC- 1/94 dated 18.01.2000, 10.11.2000 and No. E(NG)II/2000/RC-1/ Genl./17 dated 06.03.2002 & 26.05.2004 need not be reopened.” It is not made clear whether the Board’s letter dated 03.03.2009 and the Circular dated 12.11.2014 are in continuation of or in reference to the Circular dated 14.06.2006. The said fact may have relevance to construe Instruction No. 5 afore-mentioned, by which it was made clear that those employees who were medically de-categorized after the issuance of the Board’s letter dated 18.01.2000 will also be covered by the said instruction except in cases which have already been finalized and their cases need not be re-opened. Therefore, in our view, the applicability of the Circular dated 14.06.2006 is independent of the subsequent clarification of the Board’s letter dated 12.11.2014 explaining medical decategorization of the employees. It is not out of place to state that the application for grant of voluntary retirement was made on 18.06.2013, prior to the purported clarificatory Circular dated 12.11.2014.
