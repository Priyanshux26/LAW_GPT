Undoubtedly, this Court said that there is no justification for the assertion that the giving of a solitary blow on a vital part of the body resulting in death must always necessarily reduce the offence to culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under Section 304, Part II of the Code. The Court then proceeded to lay down the D criteria for judging the nature of the offence. It may be extracted; The whole thing depends upon the intention to cause death, and the case may be covered by either clause Firstly or clause Thirdly. The nature of intention must be gathered from the E kind of weapon used, the part of the body hit, the amount of force employed and the circumstance attendant upon the death. 18. We may point out that decision in Jagrup Singh’s Case 1981 Cri LJ 1136 was subsequently followed in Randhir F Singh @ Dhire v. State of Punjab Decided on September 18, 1981 and in Kulwant Rai v. State of Punjab Decided on August 7, 1981 (Criminal Appeal No. 630 of 1981). 19. Having kept this criteria under view, we are of the opinion that the offence committed by the 1st appellant would not be G covered by clause Thirdly of Para 3 of Section 300 and therefore, the conviction under Section 302, I.P.C. cannot be sustained. 20. What then is the offence committed by the 1st appellant? Looking to the age of the 1st appellant at the time of the H 1120 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A occurrence, the nature of the weapon used, the circumstances in which one blow was inflicted, the time of the day when the occurrence took place and the totality of other circumstances, namely, the previous trivial disputes between the parties, we are of the opinion that the 1st appellant could be attributed the knowledge that he was likely to cause an injury which B was likely to cause death. Accordingly, the 1st appellant is shown to have committed an offence under Section 304, Part II of the Indian Penal Code and he must be convicted for the same and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five years maintaining the sentence of fine.” C 48. In Camilo Vaz v. State of Goa [(2000) 9 SCC 1 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 1128] the accused had hit the deceased with a danda during a premeditated gang-fight, resulting in the death of the victim. Both the trial court and the Bombay High Court convicted the appellant under Section 302 IPC. This Court, however, converted the conviction to one D under Section 304 Part II IPC and observed:- (SCC p. 9, para 14) “14. … When a person hits another with a danda on a vital part of the body with such a force that the person hit meets his death, knowledge has to be imputed to the accused. In that situation case will fall in Part II of Section 304 IPC as in E the present case.” (Emphasis supplied) 49.
