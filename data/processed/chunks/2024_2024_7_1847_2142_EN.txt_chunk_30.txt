5 SCR 605 : (2003) 2 SCC 673 1894 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the Government that if two views are possible and the Government takes one of it, it would not be amenable to judicial review on the ground that the other view, according to the court, is a better view.” (Emphasis supplied) 26.5. In 5 M & T Consultants v. S.Y. Nawab (2-Judge Bench)22 this Court reiterated the principle given in Delhi Science Forum v. Union of India (3-Judge Bench)23 wherein it was observed: “…parting with privilege exclusively vested with the Government must be reasonably rational and in the public interest besides conforming to law governing the same and the decision pertaining to the same can be questioned only on grounds of bad faith, being based on irrational or irrelevant considerations, non-compliance with the prescribed procedure or violation of any constitutional or statutory provision and the onus in respect of establishing the same not only heavily rests on the person alleging it but it is not satisfied by merely raising a doubt in the mind of the Court as to the validity of the decision.” 26.6. In to declare a legislation violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, arbitrariness on the part of the legislature should, ordinarily, be manifest arbitrariness, as has been held by this Court in Bombay Dyeing & Mfg. Co. Ltd. (3) v. Bombay Environmental Action Group (2-Judge Bench),24 26.7. Similarly, in A.P. Dairy Development Corpn. Federation v. B. Narasimha Reddy, (2-Judge Bench),25 this Court held that substantive unreasonableness should be shown in the statute itself in to declare it ultra vires the Constitution. It has been held that “A party has to satisfy that the action was reasonable, not done in unreasonable manner or capriciously or 22 [2003] Supp. 4 SCR 187 : (2003) 8 SCC 100 23 [1996] 2 SCR 767 : (1996) 2 SCC 405 24 [2006] 2 SCR 920 : (2006) 3 SCC 434 25 [2011] 14 SCR 1 : (2011) 9 SCC 286 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1895 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. at pleasure without adequate determining principle, rational, and has been done according to reason or , and certainly does not depend on the will alone. However, the action of the legislature, violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, should ordinarily be manifestly arbitrary.” 26.8. The principle that to declare an Act ultra vires under Article 14, the Court must be satisfied in respect of substantive unreasonableness in the statute itself stood reiterated by this Court in State of T.N. v. K. Shyam Sunder (3-Judge Bench).26 26.9. Recently, this Court in Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr v. Union of India & Ors. (5-Judge Bench),27 while relying on Dharam Dutt v. Union of India (2-Judge Bench)28 extensively discussed this principle. It held as follows: “44. The presumption of constitutionality is based on two premises. First, it is based on democratic accountability, that is, legislators are elected representatives who are aware of the needs of the citizens and are best placed to frame policies to resolve them.
