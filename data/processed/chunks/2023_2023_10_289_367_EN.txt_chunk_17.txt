v. 311 UNION OF INDIA AND ANR. [M. R. SHAH, J.] the Old Indian Settlers, who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of A Sikkim with India and with that of the “Sikkim Subjects” registered under the Sikkim Subjects Regulations, 1961. 9.1 Shri Venkataraman, learned ASG is also not in a position to justify the Proviso to Section 10(26AAA) insofar as it excludes from the exempted category, “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese B after 01.04.2008”. 10. Shri Vivek Kohli, learned Advocate General appearing on behalf of the State of Sikkim has as such supported the objections. 10.1 It is submitted on behalf of the State that the State has no objection if the Proviso to Section 10(26AAA) depriving the right of a C “Sikkimese woman” to exemption from payment of Income Tax under Section 10(26AAA) upon her marriage to a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008 is struck down and/or is done away with so as to treat them equally in the matter of income tax exemption. 10.2 Now, so far as, the right of the old Indian settlers to pray for D the exemption under Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act is concerned, it is submitted on behalf of the State that the benefit of Section 10(26AAA) has to be extended to all Indian citizens domiciled in the State of Sikkim irrespective of the fact whether their names have been registered as “Sikkim Subjects” in the “Sikkim Subjects Register” maintained under the Sikkim Subjects Regulations, 1961 or not. E 11. Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length. 12. The challenge in the present petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India is :- (i) The definition of “Sikkimese” in Section 10(26AAA) to the extent it excludes the Indians, who have settled in Sikkim F prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975; and (ii) Proviso to Section 10(26AAA) insofar as it excludes from the exempted category “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” 13. Now, so far as the first issue is concerned, as per the definition G of “Sikkimese” only those individuals, whose names are recorded in the register maintained under the Sikkim Subjects Regulation, 1961 immediately before 26.04.1975 or whose names are recorded in the Register of “Sikkim Subjects” by virtue of Government of India’s s dated 07.08.1990 and 08.04.1991 or any other individual whose name H 312 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A does not appear in the Register of “Sikkim Subjects”, but it is established beyond doubt that the name of such individual’s father or husband or paternal grandfather or brother from the same father has been recorded in that register, are considered to be eligible as “Sikkimese” for the purpose of exemption under Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act. Meaning thereby, all those Sikkimese/Old Indian Settlers in Sikkim, B who might have settled in Sikkim prior to 26.04.1975 but whose names are not registered as “Sikkim Subjects” in the register maintained under the Sikkim Subjects Regulations, 1961 are not entitled to the exemption available under Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act.
