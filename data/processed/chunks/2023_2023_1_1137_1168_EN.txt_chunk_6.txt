It is pointed out that this clause has led the very object of this Court issuing directions being impaired, if not completely defeated. There are other aspects which have been highlighted in the application. F (4) The respondent, viz., the Union of India, has filed a counter affidavit. We find from the contents of the counter affidavit that the stand of the Union of India was that it opposed the application. (5) As we have noticed, this is an application seeking clarification. Ordinarily, be it an application lodged in this Court blessed as it is with G powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, we would have thought that the application should not receive further consideration. However, we notice that there has been a subsequent development. The development is in the form of s evidencing an attempt being made by the respondent also to evolve/agree to certain changes. Several rounds of discussions, it would appear, have taken place between officers H of the respondent-Union who not unnaturally includes medical experts. COMMON CAUSE (A REGD. SOCIETY) v.
