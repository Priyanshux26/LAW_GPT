That is to say that neither the Central Government, nor the President can make any amendments or changes in the notification issued under Clause-1 specifying the castes in relation to the States or Union territory, as the case may be. 13. Another aspect to be noted from a plain reading of the above Article is that, it does not deal with merely castes, races or tribes but also parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes, therefore, if any change is to be made with respect to inclusion or exclusion not only of any caste, race or tribe but also of a part of or group within any of the caste, race or tribe the same has to be done by law made by the Parliament. 14. The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) , 1950 was first notified on 10th August, 1950 and published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary on 11th August, 1950. With respect to the State of Bihar, the following list was mentioned in the Schedule as “Part II-Bihar”: [2024] 7 S.C.R. 803 Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar Vichar Manch Bihar, Patna v.

The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes s (Amendment) Act, 1956, which was enacted by the Parliament being Act No.63 of 1956, with respect to the State of Bihar and the Entry of the caste with which these appeals relate to, at Serial No.18 ‘Pan’ as originally mentioned in the of 1950, was replaced by ‘Pan or Sawasi’. 17. In the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes s (Amendment) Bill, 1967 enacted by the Parliament in the 20th year of the Republic of India, the list with respect to the State of Bihar mentioned in Part-III of the Schedule at Serial No.20, the following Entry of the 804 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Castes was made as ‘Pan; Sawasi, Tanti-Tantwa’. This bill never came to be enacted as an Act of Parliament and accordingly must have lapsed. 18. The next Amendment then came was the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes s (Amendment) Act, 1976 was enacted by the Parliament in the 27th year of the Republic of India, according to which, Entry-20 in Part-III of the Schedule with respect to the State of Bihar, the entry remained the same as that in the 1956 Amendment i.e. ‘Pan, Sawasi’. 19. By the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) s (Second Amendment) Act, 2002 enacted by the Parliament in the 53rd year of the Republic of India, Entry 20 for the State of Bihar was substituted by ‘Pan, Sawasi, Panr’.
