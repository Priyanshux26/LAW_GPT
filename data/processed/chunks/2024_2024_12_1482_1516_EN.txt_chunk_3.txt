whether there is any false statement/misrepresentation or deception – In the present case, the pre-conditions of ‘deceptive practice’ and unfair method’ are manifestly absent – The Banks in no manner made any misrepresentation to deceive the credit card holders – RBI held that none of the bank acted contrary to the policy directives issued by the RBI – Even otherwise, there is no averment to establish how the charging of rates of interest upon the default by credit card holders, without a standardized rate, is usurious and constitutes an unfair trade practice – Mere inflation in the rates of interest cannot be construed as a practice, intended to cause loss or injury.
