– Neither is this a case where 100/1000s of depositors have been defrauded – The allegations have to be established and proven – The right to bail in cases of delay, coupled with incarceration for a long period, depending on the nature of the allegations, should be read into s.439 of the Code and s.45 of the PML Act – The reason is that the constitutional mandate is the higher law, and it is the basic right of the person charged of an off ence and not convicted, that he be ensured and given a speedy trial – When the trial is not proceeding for reasons not attributable to the accused, the court, unless there are good reasons, may well be guided to exercise the power to grant bail – This would be truer where trial would take years.
