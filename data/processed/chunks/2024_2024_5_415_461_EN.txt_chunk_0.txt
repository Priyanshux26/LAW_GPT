[2024] 5 S.C.R. 415 : 2024 INSC 341 Association For Democratic Reforms v. Election Commission of India and Another (Writ Petition (Civil) No. 434 of 2023) 26 April 2024 [Sanjiv Khanna* and Dipankar Datta,* JJ.] Issue for Consideration Petitioners sought directions for re-introduction of the paper ballot system; or that the printed slip from the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machine be given to the voter to verify, and put in the ballot box, for counting; and/or that there should be 100% counting of the VVPAT slips in addition to electronic counting by the control unit. Headnotes Elections – Electoral Process – Representation of the People Act, 1951 – Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 – Use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) – EVM-VVPAT mechanism – Writ petitions filed on the suspicion of the possibility of manipulation of the EVMs and mismatch in votes cast through EVMs – Directions sought for returning to the paper ballot system; or that the printed slip from the VVPAT machine be given to the voter to verify; and/or for 100% counting of the VVPAT paper trails in addition to electronic counting: Held: Per Sanjiv Khanna, J. (for himself and Dipankar Datta, J.) EVM consists of three units, namely, the ballot unit, the control unit, and the VVPAT – EVM setup is designed in a rudimentary fashion and the EVM units are standalone and non-networked, i.e., they are unconnectable to any other third-party machine or input source – In case any unauthorised attempt is made to access the microcontroller or memory of the EVM, the Unauthorised Access Detection Mechanism disables it permanently – Advanced encryption techniques and strong mutual authentication or reception capability rules out the deciphering of communication between the EVM units and any unauthorised interaction with the EVM – The programme loaded in the EVM is key hashed and burnt into a One Time Programmable microcontroller chip at the time of manufacturing, thus dispelling any possibility of tampering – All the three units of * Authors 416 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the EVM have microcontrollers in which the respective firmware is burnt – The burnt programme/code is unalterable and cannot be modified after the EVM is delivered/supplied to Election Commission of India (ECI) – Every key press of the control unit is dynamically coded, making it impossible to decode the signal flowing among the units of the EVM inter se – Firmware of the control unit is agnostic to any candidate name or political party symbol – The possibility to hack or tamper with the agnostic firmware in the burnt memory to tutor/favour results is unfounded – The suspicion that EVMs can be manipulated for repeated or wrong recording of vote(s) to favour a particular candidate, rejected – ECI has conducted random VVPAT verification of 5 polling booths per assembly segment/constituency for 41,629 EVMs-VVPATs – More than 4 crore VVPAT slips have been tallied with the electronic counts of their control units – Not even a single case of mismatch (except one which arose on account of failure of the presiding officer to delete the mock poll data) or wrong recording of votes was detected – EVMs subjected to test by technical experts committee from time to time wherein no fault was found – The M3 EVMs currently in use are designed by engineers of BHEL and ECIL and vetted by the aforesaid committee – A number of safeguards and protocols with stringent checks have been put in place, as elucidated – Administrative and technical safeguards of the EVM reviewed in detail – Data and figures do not indicate artifice and deceit – Imagination and suppositions should not lead to hypothesize a wrong doing without any basis or facts – Credibility of the ECI and integrity of the electoral process earned over years cannot be over-ridden by contemplations and speculations – In N. Chandrababu Naidu v. Union of India, the direction for counting the VVPAT paper trail in 5 EVMs per assembly constituency or assembly segment in a parliamentary constituency was issued to ensure the highest level of confidence in the accuracy of election results – Giving physical access to VVPAT slips to voters is problematic and impractical and will lead to misuse, malpractices and disputes – Not inclined to modify the directions to increase the number of VVPAT undergoing slip count – Data and the results do not indicate any need to increase the number of VVPAT units subjected to manual counting – EVMs are simple, secure and user-friendly – Moreover, the incorporation of the VVPAT system fortifies the principle of vote verifiability, enhancing the overall accountability of the electoral process – Electoral reforms would be undone by directing reintroduction of the ballot papers – Submission to return to the [2024] 5 S.C.R.
