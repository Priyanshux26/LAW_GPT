Section 41 necessitates an agreement between the appropriate government and the company for whose purpose the land is being acquired. One of the purposes of such an agreement is to ensure that payment towards the cost of acquisition is made by the company to the appropriate government and it is only upon such payment that the land is transferred to the company. Thus, it can be said that JAL was mandated to make the requisite payment to the State of Himachal Pradesh prior to the subject land being transferred to it. 55. However, as discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, even before the amount of compensation could be determined by way of a supplementary award as stipulated in the Award dated 08.06.2018, the subject land stood transferred to JAL. This, in our view, is in contravention of Section 38 of the 2013 Act and Section 41 of the 1894 Act respectively. 472 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 56. Thus, we deem it appropriate to direct the Respondent Nos. 7 and 10 that is, the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Land Acquisition Collector, Arki, to pay the amount of Rs. 3,05,31,095/- to the Respondent Nos. 1-6 for expeditious conclusion of the acquisition proceedings. However, we clarify that the State shall recover the said amount from JAL as the liability to pay the cost of acquisition of the subject land ultimately falls on JAL in view of the aforesaid discussion. VIII. CONCLUSION 57. For all the foregoing reasons, this appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed in the aforesaid terms. The impugned dated 12.07.2022 passed by the High Court is set aside. 58. The Respondent Nos. 7 and 10 are directed to pay the compensation amount of Rs. 3,05,31,095/- (Rupees Three Crore Five Lakh Thirty-One Thousand and Ninety-Five Only) along with 9% interest thereupon from the date of passing of the Supplementary Award i.e., 02.05.2022 till the date of realization, within a period of fifteen days from today. The total amount paid by the State shall be recovered from the Respondent No. 11 (JAL). Result of the Case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
