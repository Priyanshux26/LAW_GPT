The High Court, by its common impugned , on an appreciation of the facts at hand, acquitted A-3 Joginder @ Mintu of all D charges; and acquitted the present appellants only for offence under Section 411, but affirmed their conviction for other offences, as well as the corresponding sentence imposed by the trial court. Aggrieved by the impugned , A-1 and A-2 have approached this court, challenging both the conviction and sentence; this court issued notice on the limited E question of sentence. Appellants’ contentions 5. Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned senior counsel, appearing for the appellants, placed strong emphasis on this court’s decision in Union of India v. Sriharan @ Murugan &Ors.4, which categorically held F that it was outside the jurisdiction of the trial court, to provide a specific term punishment or till the end of ordinary life, as an alternative to the death penalty. It was urged that this aspect, however, was overlooked by the High Court – which was reason enough to set aside the erroneous decision.
