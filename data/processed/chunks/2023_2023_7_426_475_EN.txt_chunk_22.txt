H 462 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A 20. It has also been the argument of the petitioners that making exception for bulls to carve them out of the protective mechanism of the 1960 Act was not based on any intelligible criteria but on an arbitrary selection. Learned Counsel for the petitioners relied on Director of Education (Secondary) and Another -vs- Pushpendra Kumarand Others [(1998) 5 SCC 192], Harbilas Rai Bansal -vs- State of B Punjaband Another [(1996) 1 SCC 1], State of Gujarat and Another -vs- Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soniand Others [(1983) 2 SCC 33] and Shayara Bano -vs- Union of India and Others [(2017) 9 SCC 1] to substantiate this argument. 21. We shall first deal with the argument advanced on behalf of C the petitioners that animals have rights. In fact, what has been urged before us is that animals have Fundamental Rights as also legal rights. It has been held in A. Nagaraja (supra) case at paragraph 66 (in the Report):- “66. Rights guaranteed to the animals under Sections 3, 11, D etc. are only statutory rights. The same have to be elevated to the status of fundamental rights, as has been done by few countries around the world, so as to secure their honour and dignity. Rights and freedoms guaranteed to the animals under Sections 3 and 11 have to be read along with Article 51-A(g) E and (h) of the Constitution, which is the magna carta of animal rights.” 22. The concept of animal rights has been anchored by the petitioners on dual foundation. It has been submitted that our jurisprudence does not recognise rights only for human beings and Narayan Dutt Bhatt -vs- Union of India [(2018) SCC OnLine Utt 645] has been cited to F demonstrate that animals are legal entities having a distinct persona with corresponding rights, duties and liabilities as that of a legal person. In to put emphasis on this concept of evolving rights, petitioners have submitted that our legal system is both organic and dynamic in nature and with passage of time law must change. (Saurabh Chaudri and G Others -vs- Union of India and Others [(2003) 11 SCC 146], Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh and Others -vs- L.V.A. Dixitulu and Others [(1979) 2 SCC 34], Video Electronics Pvt. Ltd. and Another -vs- State of Punjab and Another [(1990) 3 SCC 87] and Ashok Kumar Gupta and Another v. State of U.P. and Others, [(1997) 5 SCC 201]). In this regard, certain international authorities being Argentina, H THE ANIMAL WELFARE BOARD OF INDIA AND ORS. v. 463 UNION OF INDIA & ANR. [ANIRUDDHA BOSE, J.] Case No.P-72.254/2015 has been cited. Further, our attention has been A drawn to the Animal Wellbeing (Sentience) Act, 2022 recognising animals as sentient beings in the United Kingdom. It has also been asserted that rights of sentient animals have been recognised by the Constitutional Court of Ecuador. On behalf of the respondents, the factum of existence of animal rights has not been directly contested but the stand of the B respondents on this point is that the rights which the sentient animal would have enjoyed ought to be subject to the legislative provisions and in a case of this nature, which is likely to have seminal impact not only on our jurisprudence but our society as well, legislature would be a better judge to determine what would be the nature, contours and limitations of such rights.
