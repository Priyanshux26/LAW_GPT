To buttress the contention that the right to privacy of an individual must yield to the right to fair trial of another, reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited & Ors. vs. Securities and B Exchange Board of India & Anr.4. 35. Attractive as it may seem at first blush, the said argument does not carry any legal weight. The lis in these cases is between the parties to a marriage. The lis is not between one of the parties to the marriage and the child whose paternity is questioned. To enable one of C the parties to the marriage to have the benefit of fair trial, the Court cannot sacrifice the rights and best interests of a third party to the lis, namely, the child. 36. Therefore, I concur wholeheartedly with my learned sister that the Family Court as well as the High Court were wrong in allowing D the application of the respondent for subjecting the child to DNA test. Therefore, the appeal deserves to be allowed and accordingly it is allowed. However, this shall not preclude the respondent-husband from leading any other evidence to establish the allegations made by him against the appellant in the petition for divorce. E Divya Pandey Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Shevali Monga, LCRA) F G H 4 (2012) 10 SCC 603
