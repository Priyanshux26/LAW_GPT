C 3.7. The findings and reasoning of the learned Single Judge of the High Court in partly allowing the writ petition filed by Respondent No.1, have been encapsulated as under: i) That there was no requirement to consider the validity of the s of the Appellant-University dated 20th October, D 2011 and 12th January, 2012. That the only question that would require consideration is as to the entitlement of Respondent No. 1 to two advance increments which had been denied to him only on account of the fact that a subsequent Government had been passed stipulating E that teachers who had already got the benefit of advance increments for having a Ph.D. degree, would not be eligible for advance increments at the time of their placement in the selection grade. ii) That the subsequent Government dated 29th March, F 2001 had modified the Government dated 21st December, 1999 to the extent of stating that teachers who had already got the benefit of advance increments for having a Ph.D. degree, would not be eligible for advance increments at the time of their placement in the selection grade. That an amendment cannot be stated to have G retrospective effect unless it is expressly provided that it shall operate retrospectively, vide Ex-Capt. K.C. Arora vs. State of Haryana, 1984 (3) SCC 281 (K.C. Arora). That a perusal of the Government dated 29th March, 2001 would not indicate that it was meant to operate H retrospectively. SREE SANKARACHARYA UNIVERSITY OF SANSKRIT & 371 ORS. v. DR. MANU & ANR. [NAGARATHNA, J.] iii) That since Respondent No.1 was notionally placed in the A selection grade from 22nd December, 1999, i.e., before the subsequent Government dated 29th March, 2001 was passed, he would be entitled to the benefit of Clause 6.18 of the Government dated 21st December, 1999. 3.8. The Appellant-University challenged the passed by B the learned Single Judge of the High Court by filing a writ appeal, numbered as W.A. No. 254 of 2016, before the Division Bench of the High Court. 3.9. By the impugned dated 10th August, 2016, the Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala dismissed the said writ C appeal filed by the Appellant-University and confirmed the of the learned Single Judge of the High Court, dated 13th October, 2015 whereby the Appellant-University was directed to grant two advance increments to Respondent No.1 in terms of Clause 6.18 of the Government dated 21st December, 1999. D The pertinent findings of the Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned dated 10th August, 2016 have been culled out as under: i) That admittedly, the Government, by way of the dated 29th March, 2001 had modified the Government dated E 21st December, 1999 by specifying certain conditions for eligibility for grant of advance increments on being placed in the selection grade. Simply because the dated 29th March, 2001 had been passed when a clarification was sought as to whether teachers who had already got the benefit of advance increments for having a Ph.D. degree, F would be eligible for advance increments at the time of their placement in the selection grade, the said cannot be termed as a clarificatory and be made effective retrospectively.
