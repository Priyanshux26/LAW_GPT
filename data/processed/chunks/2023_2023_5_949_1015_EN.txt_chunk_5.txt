and for that purpose the reliance placed upon sections 132, F 141, 147, 245 and 447 of the Act is concerned, it is required to be noted that all the aforesaid provisions and section 140(5) operate in different field. Merely because the auditor can be removed as an auditor of a company including the other provisions, section 140(5) which has been enacted with a special object and purpose G cannot be said to be arbitrary and/or ultra vires. [Para 8][1008- H; 1009-A, B-C] 6.2. As per the Scheme of the Act, 2013, more particularly Chapter X, the auditor acts as an independent examiner of accounts and cannot be said to be holding an office in the conduct H 956 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A and management of the company. Therefore, the submission that what could be achieved under section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 can be achieved by Section 241(3) even after the auditor has resigned has no substance. [Para 9][1009-G-H] 6.3. In section 140(5), it is specifically mentioned that B “without prejudice to any action under the provisions of this Act or any other law for the time being in force”. Therefore, the intention of the legislature while enacting section 140(5) is very clear and the powers conferred upon the Tribunal under section 140(5) shall be without prejudice to any action under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 or any other law for the C time being in force. Therefore, irrespective of any other provisions of the Act, 2013, the Tribunal is vested with the powers under Section 140(5) of the Act to pass a final against the auditor on the allegation that such an auditor of the company has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner. [Para 10][1010- D A-C] 7. Section 140(5) cannot be said to be excessive and/or manifestly arbitrary, as contended. It was the case on behalf of the original writ petitioners on the constitutionality/vires of section 140(5) that section 140(5) is excessive and arbitrary as it E provides unguided and untrammelled powers to NCLT for determination of a serious offence of fraud and consequence of mandatory disqualification with grave consequences akin to civil death. The aforesaid has no substance. NCLT shall exercise the quasi-judicial powers under section 140(5) with all the powers akin to civil court. Ample opportunity shall be given by the NCLT F before passing any final . [Para 12][1011-A-C] 8. Insofar as the submission that section 140(5) is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and discriminates against the auditors unfairly in comparison to similarly placed alleged perpetrators, such as directors, management etc. is concerned, G it is required to be noted that the role of auditors cannot be equated with directors and/or management. Auditors play very important role in the affairs of the company and therefore they have to act in the larger public interest and all other stakeholders including investors etc. Chapter X of the Act specifically for the “Audit and Auditors” looking to the importance of the auditors.
