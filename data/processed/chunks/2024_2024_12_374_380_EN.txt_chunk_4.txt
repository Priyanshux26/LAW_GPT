Any other way, the Appellant is not a teacher and was only involved in administrative work with CSIIT. The Appellant has not led any evidence until now to prove that he qualifies as a teacher after becoming Director. AICTE and UGC regulations are applicable only to those who qualify as teachers and are discharging classroom teaching duties. 11. Regarding the judgements relied upon by the Appellant to establish that the amended UGC regulations are not merely recommendatory, we have considered them and find those to be distinguishable on fact and as such we are not dealing with them. 12. In view of the above and the fact that the Appellant has already retired, and Respondent No.4 is discharging his duties as Director 380 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of Respondent No.2 Institute, we find no reason to interfere with the impugned judgement passed by the High Court. 13. Accordingly, the present appeal stands dismissed. 14. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
