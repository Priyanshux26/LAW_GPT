There are several other factors which must be taken into account while considering the question as to whether the death sentence should be vacated. A convict is undoubtedly entitled to pursue all remedies lawfully open to him to get rid of the sentence of death imposed upon him and indeed, there is no one, be he blind, lame, starving or suffering from a terminal illness, who does not want to live.’ It was further observed: [SCC p. 357 : SCC (Cri) p. 474, para 20] ‘Finally, and that is no less important, the nature of the offence, the diverse circumstances attendant upon it, its impact upon the contemporary society and the question whether the motivation and pattern of the crime are such as are likely to lead to its repetition, if the death sentence is vacated, are matters which must enter into the verdict as to whether the sentence should be vacated for the reason that its execution is delayed. The substitution of the death sentence by a sentence of life imprisonment cannot follow by the application of the two years’ formula, as a matter of quod erat demonstrandum.’ 3. In Javed case [(1985) 1 SCC 275 : 1984 SCC (Cri) 653 : (1985) 2 SCR 8] it was observed that the condemned man who had suffered more than two years and nine months and was repenting and there was nothing adverse against him 590 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in the jail records, this period of two years and nine months with the sentence of death heavily weighing on his mind will entitle him for commutation of sentence of death into imprisonment for life. It is because of this controversy that the matter was referred to a five-Judges’ Bench and hence it is before us.” (emphasis added) Ultimately, in paragraph 23, the Constitution Bench held thus: “23. So far as our conclusions are concerned we had delivered our on 11-10-1988 and we had reserved the reasons to be given later. Accordingly in the light of the discussions above our conclusion is as recorded in our dated 11-10-1988 [Triveniben v. State of Gujarat, (1988) 4 SCC 574 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 25], reproduced below: [SCC p. 576: SCC (Cri) pp. 26-27, para 2] ‘Undue long delay in execution of the sentence of death will entitle the condemned person to approach this Court under Article 32 but this Court will only examine the nature of delay caused and circumstances that ensued after sentence was finally confirmed by the judicial process and will have no jurisdiction to reopen the conclusions reached by the court while finally maintaining the sentence of death. This Court, however, may consider the question of inordinate delay in the light of all circumstances of the case to decide whether the execution of sentence should be carried out or should be altered into imprisonment for life. No fixed period of delay could be held to make the sentence of death inexecutable and to this extent the decision in Vatheeswaran case [(1983) 2 SCC 68 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 342 : (1983) 2 SCR 348] cannot be said to lay down the correct law and therefore to that extent stands overruled.’’ (emphasis added) In paragraph 16, the Constitution Bench held that while considering the delay, the period consumed in the judicial process culminating [2024] 12 S.C.R.
