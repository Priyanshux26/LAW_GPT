C 13. It was only pursuant to the direction given by this Court vide the dated 25.11.2013, the Appointing Authority was expected to hear the respondent and pass appropriate . This Court had kept all the contentions of all the parties open. Hence the Appointing Authority after issuing show-cause notice and granting opportunity of hearing to the respondent had passed the imposing the penalty of “Dismissal D from Service” w.e.f. 11.08.1999, i.e., from the date when the first of dismissal was passed by the Appointing Authority. Since all the contentions were kept open by this Court while allowing the appeal filed by the Appellant-Bank, as such no affirmative action was expected from the Appellant- Bank, as sought to be submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent. The said of Appointing Authority dismissing E the respondent from service after granting opportunity of hearing to the respondent was in consonance with the direction given by this Court and could not be said to be arbitrary illegal or in violation of Rule 19(3) of the said Rules. The impugned of the High Court setting aside the said of dismissal being under misconception of facts and law deserves to be quashed and set aside. F 14. In that view of the matter the impugned passed by the Division Bench confirming the passed by the Single Bench, is hereby accordingly set aside. 15. The appeal stands allowed.
