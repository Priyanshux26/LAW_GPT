The Respondent No.1 – herein (original plaintiff) instituted suit for specific performance of contract based on an unregistered sale deed dated 12-02-1986 with respect to the suit property. 5.

In such circumstances, the plaintiff went before the High Court by way of Second Appeal under Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. 9.

The High Court after due consideration of all the relevant aspects of the matter recorded a categorical finding that the subsequent purchasers, i.e., the appellants – herein could not be said to be bona fide purchasers in accordance with Section 19 (b) of the Act, 1963 for the reasons assigned as under.
