This can very well be reflected by verse 13 of chapter 4 and verse 41 of chapter 18 of the Bhagwat Gita which I quote below. 60. चाातुुर्ववर्ण्यव मयाा सृृष्टंं गुुणकमवविर्वभाागुशःः। (Chapter 4, Verse 13, Bhagwat Gita) ब्रााह्मणक्षत्रि�याविर्वशःा ंशःूद्रााणा ंचा परन्तप। कमावणिण प्रविर्वभाक्ताावि� स्वभाार्वप्रभार्वैगुवुणैः॥ (Chapter 18, Verse 41, Bhagwat Gita) Lord Krishna says that I have categorised humans in 4 varnas according to their nature and characteristics. Gita thus only promotes varna system which is different from present day caste system. It lays emphasis on abilities, qualities and consciousness of a person to have a balanced structure of society and to bring out the best in every person. The four varnas (occupational categories) are: - 1. Bharama Teachers, Priests and Intellectuals (Priestly class) 2. Kshatriyas Warriors, Police and Administrators (Administrative class) 3. Vaishayas Farmers, Merchants, Traders and Businessman (Mercantile and Farmer class) 4. Shudras Artisans, Workers and Labour class (Worker class) 61. The Bhagvad Gita in subsequent verses describes the intrinsic qualities of each of the varnas. The varna system depicting occupational categories can also be explained with the physical body of a person wherein the head of a person which does intellectual work is called ‘Bharaman’. The hands which protect him and his family does the job of a ‘Kshatriya’. The abdomen which requires food to convert it into energy refers to ‘Vaishayas’, who are predominantly the farmers and the merchants invested to earn livelihood. The lower limbs (legs) do all kind of labour work and are referred to as ‘Shudras’. 1666 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 62. The Skanda Purana also contains a shloka: जन्म�ा जायातु शःूद्राः सृंस्काारातु ्द्वि�ज उच्यतुे | 20 which means that everyone is born as Shudra i.e. to work and slowly each one of them elevates himself to a higher status of Vaishya, Kshatriya and Brahmin on the strength of his talent, quality, character and nature. 63. It means the duties of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras were distributed according to their qualities (guns) and nature (and not by birth). All people have different nature and characteristics. Their personality is shaped according to their qualities (gunas). Thus, different professionals duties are suited to persons of different nature and character. Since the center of society is God (Parmatma), everyone (atma) works according to their intrinsic qualities to sustain themselves and the society. 64. According to the varna system no one is to be considered as lower or higher, rather it is preached that everyone is equal fragment and a part and parcel of Him, the Almighty. Gita nowhere preaches that the aforesaid varnas are on the basis of birth and are not interchangeable. However, with the passage of time, the varna system deteriorated and the people started labelling these varnas on the basis of birth, ignoring the nature and characteristics of a person which is exactly the opposite to what is preached in Gita. The varnas were given the nomenclature of castes in a very loose manner. 65. Later, children of Brahmins started calling themselves as Brahmins, irrespective of whether they possessed the corresponding qualities or not.
