The whole idea under the provisions discussed is to facilitate a person of unsound mind to stand trial, not only because of his reasoning capacity, but also to treat him as the one who is having a disability. The role of the Court is to find the remedial measures and do complete justice. [Paras 17 and 16][835-B-D] D Surendra Mishra v.

G From the and dated 02.06.2008 of the High Court of Bombay Bench at Goa in CRLA No.63 of 2006. Aftab Ali Khan, (SCLSC), M. Z. Chaudhary, Shahbaz, Arvind Kr. Kanva, Sayyed Imtiyaz Ali, Ms. Amna Darakshan, Ali Safeer Farooqi, Advs. for the Appellant. H PRAKASH NAYI @ SEN v. STATE OF GOA 827 The of the Court was delivered by A M. M. SUNDRESH, J. “Was’t Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet. If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away, And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does B it not; Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? His madness. if’t be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged; His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.” -William Shakespeare (Source : Hamlet, W.S. (Play) Act-5 Scene-2 Line-245) C 1. While acknowledging the hurt that he has caused to Laertes for causing the death of his father, whom he murdered by way of a mistaken identity, Hamlet pleads temporary madness. While pleading so, he disassociates himself from the act as if it was done by a third person and he was made to suffer the consequence. He thus pleads to D treat him as a victim rather than an offender. Though the act of Hamlet does constitute a culpable homicide coming within the definition of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 an act of unsound mind would not attract the same. Through these lines,Shakespeare brings out the agony of a man having to justify his act of madness. E 2. Raising the plea of insanity on the mandate of Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter ‘the IPC’), the appellant seeks reversal of the of conviction passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay at Goa, confirming the of the Additional Sessions Judge, S.G. Margao-II. As we are dealing with the seminal issue of applicability of Section 84 of the IPC and in the light of the focus F made by the counsel for the appellant, we do not propose to go into the merits.
