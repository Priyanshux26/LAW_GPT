The of the High Court refers to the evidence in detail, with the acquittal of the respondents grounded in the following findings: (i) FIR No. 336/1998, marked Exhibit 51, is ante-timed. (ii) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is not an eye-witness, but rather a planted witness, as his name was not mentioned in the fardbeyan (Exhibit 50). His antecedents are questionable. (iii) The testimony of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) implicating the respondents-accused is unreliable because: (a) he is Brij Bihari Prasad’s brother-in-law; (b) he should have been the informant but was not, which raises doubts about his presence at the IGIMS hospital; (c) he contradicted the prosecution’s case by accepting that Rajan Tiwari (A-9), whom he knew beforehand, was not present during the incident. However, in his statement under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973,10 he claimed that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was one of the assailants of Lakshmeshwar Sahu; and (d) he deposed under the pressure of his sister, Rama Devi (PW-24), who was present in the court during the recording of his evidence on all (three) days. (iv) The deposition of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) is unreliable on the following grounds: (a) he is a convict in a murder case registered in the year 1979; (b) he did not surrender after the dismissal of his appeal by the High Court and was accordingly declared an absconder; (c) he was arrested on 04.05.2006 while deposing before the trial court in the present case; 9 The appeal qua Shashi Kumari Rai (A-7) stood abated on account of his demise vide dated 28.02.2020. 10 For short, “CrPC”.

The State of Bihar and Others (d) he was under the patronage and protection of Brij Bihari Prasad and his wife, Rama Devi (PW-24); (e) there is a contradiction between the versions of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) regarding their presence in the hospital room of Brij Bihari Prasad at IGIMS hospital. While Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) claims that Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) was in the hospital room when he arrived there, Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) states that Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) was already present in the hospital room of Brij Bihari Prasad when he (Mahanth Ashwani Das) reached the hospital.
