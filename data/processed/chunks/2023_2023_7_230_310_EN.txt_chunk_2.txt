H BISHAMBHAR PRASAD v. M/s. ARFAT PETROCHEMICALS 233 PVT. LTD. AND ORS. Disposing of the appeals, the Court A HELD: Whether the LIA, Kota has been always under the management and control of the State Government or it was transferred to RIICO pursuant to Government dated B 18.09.1979? 1. The relationship of lessor and lessee between State of Rajasthan and JKSL continued uninterruptedly till JKSL was declared a ‘sick company’. Respondent No.1 then stepped into the shoes of JKSL under the s of AAIFR, and by virtue of C the tripartite agreements executed with the labour unions, for the land at LIA, Kota. It is also an admitted fact that neither under the tripartite settlements dated 9.10.2002 and 22.10.2002, nor under the sanctioned rehabilitation scheme dated 23.1.2003, the relationship of lessor and lessee between State, JKSL, or Respondent No.1, as the case may be, was ever disrupted. There D is no cessation in the relationship of lessor and lessee between the State and Respondent No. 1, or its predecessor JKSL. This contractual relationship duly governed under the 1956 Act read with the 1959 Rules, was never terminated expressly or otherwise and neither was it substituted by a supplementary conveyance E deed. A relationship of lessor–lessee between State Government and JKSL/RIICO continued to subsist and has not been affected in any manner by virtue of Government dated 18.09.1979. [Paras 40, 41 and 48][282-E-G; 283-A-B; 284-F] Whether the 1979 Rules of RIICO are statutory in nature? F 2.1. The plain wording of Rule 11A of the Rajasthan Industrial Areas Allotment Rules, 1959 clearly shows that the Corporation can have merely managerial power over the land that is allocated to it. As laid down very clearly under Rule 11A, the allotment to RIICO is done purely on a leasehold basis, and ownership and title remain unequivocally with the State G Government. RIICO acts as nothing but an agent of the State in its efforts to increase industrial production and further economic progress. The State remains the overarching power in this dynamic and RIICO remains subservient to it. The relationship of lessor and lessee between State and Respondent No. 1 has H 234 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A been validly subsisting at all times and RIICO was never authorised either by Government dated 18.09.1979 or under Rules 11A and 12 of the 1959 Rules, to bypass the State Government and assume the self – styled role of the lessor in respect of LIA, Kota. Since, the 1967 and 2007 lease deeds in favour of JKSL and Respondent No. 1, respectively, were B executed by the State Government in terms of Rule 2 of the 1959 Rules, RIICO had no authority whatsoever to permit Respondent No. 1 to change the land use or allow for the sub – division of plot without the prior approval of the State Government, which is the sole competent authority to accord such permission in exercise C of its power under Rule 8 of the 1959 Rules. The contrary view taken by the High Court is plainly erroneous in law and is based on a misconstruction of the provisions of 1959 Rules read with the binding bilateral contracts between the parties.
