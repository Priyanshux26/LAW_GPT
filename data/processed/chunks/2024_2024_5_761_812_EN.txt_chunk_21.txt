It is also clear that with a view to achieve the object of the enactment, that 17 [2002] 3 SCR 1167 : (2002) 6 SCC 33 : 2002 INSC 287 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 793 Child in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. The State of Karnataka and Another there may be speedy disposal of such cases, that it has been provided that reply is to be filed within 30 days and the extension of time may not exceed 15 days. This provision envisages that proceedings may not be prolonged for a very long time without the opposite party having filed his reply. No penal consequences have however been provided in case extension of time exceeds 15 days. Therefore, it could not be said that any substantive right accrued in favour of the appellant or there was any kind of bar of limitation in filing of the reply within extended time though beyond 45 days in all. The reply is not necessarily to be rejected. All facts and circumstances of the case must be taken into account. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act also provides that the principles of natural justice have also to be kept in mind.” (emphasis supplied) 9.17 This Court in Kailash vs Nanhku and Others18 while interpretating VIII Rule 1 CPC prescribing time limit for filing written statement, held the same to be directory in nature. Relevant paras 30 and 46 thereof are extracted below: “30. It is also to be noted that though the power of the court under the proviso appended to Rule 1 8 is circumscribed by the words “shall not be later than ninety days” but the consequences flowing from non-extension of time are not specifically provided for though they may be read in by necessary implication. Merely because a provision of law is couched in a negative language implying mandatory character, the same is not without exceptions. The courts, when called upon to interpret the nature of the provision, may, keeping in view the entire context in which the provision came to be enacted, hold the same to be directory though worded in the negative form. x x x 18 [2005] 3 SCR 289 : (2005) 4 SCC 480 : 2005 INSC 186 794 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 46. We sum up and briefly state our conclusions as under: (i) - (iii) xxxx (iv) The purpose of providing the time schedule for filing the written statement under 8 Rule 1 CPC is to expedite and not to scuttle the hearing. The provision spells out a disability on the defendant. It does not impose an embargo on the power of the court to extend the time. Though the language of the proviso to Rule 1 8 CPC is couched in negative form, it does not specify any penal consequences flowing from the non-compliance. The provision being in the domain of the procedural law, it has to be held directory and not mandatory. The power of the court to extend time for filing the written statement beyond the time schedule provided by 8 Rule 1 CPC is not completely taken away.
