17.5. The issue of stamping is to be looked into at the very threshold, even if it is in exercise of Section 11 (6A) of the Arbitration Act, 1996, i.e. at the time, the consideration with respect to appointment of C arbitrator is undertaken. According to the learned counsel, an instrument would exist in law only when it is enforceable. Therefore, when the Court under Section 11(6A) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 is considering the “existence” of the arbitration agreement, it can examine the issue of non-stamping or of inadequate stamping at that stage itself. 17.6. Highlighting that three modes are provided in NN Global D (supra) i.e. impounding, payment of stamp duty and then appointment of arbitrator, it is argued that when an arbitrator is appointed in a Section 11 application, the Court is certainly “acting upon” the arbitration clause which is contended to be barred by the clear wordings of Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899. An Agreement, unless “enforceable”, is not in E “existence”. 18. The learned Senior Advocate, Ms. Malvika Trivedi, intervening on behalf of the Appellant made the following submissions: 18.1. The Regimes of the Stamp Act, 1899 and Registration Act, 1908 are completely different. NN Global (supra) wrongly applied F the principles of registration of a document to the requirement of stamping a document. While the former is a curable defect, the latter determines the very existence and completion of a document/instrument. In the absence of registration, an instrument still remains in existence but without stamping, the instrument is incomplete/inchoate. G 18.2. The Stamp Act, 1899 envisages the payment of stamp duty, failing which the instrument according to Ms. Trivedi cannot be acted upon for any purpose. There is no ambiguity in the language of the Statute and plain reading should be opted. 17 [2020] UKSC 38 H 434 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A 18.3. The powers of the Court under different provisions of law, as well as the restrictions created in the Stamp Act, 1899 apply to the proceedings conducted in accordance with Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. It is, therefore, argued that even if the arbitration clause stands severed, the Court will have to reach a prima facie conclusion on whether the main agreement is enforceable in law before granting B interim measures. 19. Learned Counsel for the Respondent No. 1, Mr. Ramakanth Reddy, took us through the relevant Lok Sabha debates before the enactment of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and makes the following submissions: C 19.1 Provisions of Arbitration Act, 1996; Stamp Act, 1899 and Contract Act, 1872 can be harmonized. Section 17 of Stamp Act, 1899 has to be read with Section 31 of Stamp Act, 1899. 19.2 Plain language of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 does not require that the parties stamp the agreement. The legislative D intention would be defeated, if the Court insists on non-core technical requirements such as stamps, seals and originals. 20. In his turn, Mr. Debesh Panda, learned Counsel for the Intervenor submits the following: E 20.1 Part I of Arbitration Act, 1996 deals with Section 8,9 and 11 whereas Section 45 is dealt with in Part II.
