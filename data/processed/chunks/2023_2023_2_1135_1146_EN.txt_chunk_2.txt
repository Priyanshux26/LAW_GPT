In consequence, C.S. No. 386 of 1985 was dismissed. Aggrieved thereby, the legal representatives of the deceased plaintiffs, who were on record in the writ petition, filed Review Petition No. 75 of 2009. However, by its dated 09.09.2009, the High Court reiterated its finding that the H 1138 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A tenant had never parted with possession of the leased premises and had never left the premises, being a partner. Holding so, the High Court concluded that there was no error on the face of the record and dismissed the review petition. Presently, these two s are under appeal. 4. While so, the tenant, Janardhan Subajirao Wide, the sole B respondent in these appeals, expired on 16.02.2018. Thereupon, the appellants filed I.A. No. 89838 of 2021 seeking condonation of the delay of 1169 days in taking steps and I.A. No. 89837 of 2021 to set aside the abatement of the appeals and to permit substitution of the legal heirs of the deceased respondent. Notice having been ed thereon, Mr. Sudhanshu S. Choudhari, learned counsel, who had earlier appeared for C the deceased respondent, e-filed his vakalatnama/appearance on behalf of the legal representatives on 05.11.2022. No counter was filed by him opposing the applications. Sufficient cause having been shown, delay in taking necessary steps is condoned; abatement of the appeals is set aside; and legal representatives of the deceased sole respondent are D brought on record. Registry shall make necessary changes in the cause titles in both the appeals before issuing certified copies of this . 5. Heard Mr. Vinay Navare, learned senior counsel, appearing for the appellants; and Mr. Sudhanshu S. Choudhari, learned counsel, appearing for the respondents. E 6. The leased premises, consisting of two blocks with an approximate area of 455 sq. ft., are situated on the ground floor on the eastern side of the cement-concrete building, bearing C.T.S No. 1873 at Bhamburda, Pune. These premises were let out to the tenant by the original landlord and landlady, the predecessors-in-title of the appellants, for the purpose of his hotel business under the name and style of Hotel F Ambika. Civil Suit No. 386 of 1985 was filed by the landlord and landlady for eviction of the tenant on two grounds. Their claim was that the tenant carried out unauthorized construction of a toilet in the leased premises, thereby violating the mandate of Section 13(1)(b) of the Act of 1947. It was also their case that the tenant parted with the running of the hotel G and possession of the leased premises in favour of one Krishna B Shetty, thereby committing breach of Section 13(1)(e) of the Act of 1947. These grounds are borne out by the plaint filed in the suit, which is sought to be placed on record, by way of I.A. No. 38142 of 2023, along with a photocopy of Section 15 of the Act of 1947. I.A. No. 38143 of 2023 was filed seeking exemption from filing an official translation of the plaint.
