[Paras 16 and 17] Object of the RTI Act – Purposive interpretation of RTI Act – Formation of Benches allows efficient allocation of work: Held: The RTI Act should be interpreted purposively, taking into account the broader objectives of the legislation – The purpose of the RTI Act is to promote transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities, ensuring citizens’ right to information – To achieve these objectives effectively, it is essential that the Central Information Commission operates efficiently and [2024] 7 S.C.R. 619 Central Information Commission v. D.D.A. & Anr. without undue procedural constraints – The principle of purposive interpretation supports the view that the CIC’s powers under Section 12(4) of the RTI Act include all necessary measures to manage and direct the Commission’s affairs effectively – This includes the ability to form benches to handle the increasing volume of cases – The formation of Benches allows for the efficient allocation of work and ensures the timely disposal of cases, which is crucial for upholding the right to information. [Para 18] Legislative intent – Interpretation of “superintendence, direction, and control” – The Central Information Commission (Management) Regulations, 2007 are tools to ensure the efficient administration and operation of the Commission: Held: The legislative intent, as reflected by the broad language of these provisions, was to provide the officials with necessary authority to ensure that their Commissions function effectively and efficiently – These provisions explicitly use the words “superintendence, direction and management” of the affairs of the Commission – Reliance placed on the in Election Commission of India v. Ashok Kumar [2000] Supp. 3 SCR 34 : (2000) 8 SCC 216 : 2000 INSC 423 and in Union of India v. Association for Democratic Reforms [2002] 3 SCR 696 : (2002) 5 SCC 294 : 2002 INSC 253, wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court has interpreted the words “superintendence, direction, and control” occurring in Article 324 (1) of the Constitution in respect of the Election Commission – The use of the words “superintendence, direction and management” in Sections 12(4) and 15(4) of the RTI Act clearly provides the CIC an ambit of power wide enough to frame its own Regulations and to delegate its power to a committee formed by it – The Central Information Commission, utilizing these broad powers, has enacted The Central Information Commission (Management) Regulations, 2007 – While the RTI Act does not explicitly grant the CIC the authority to frame Regulations, the overarching powers granted under Section 12(4) of the RTI Act inherently include the ability to manage the Commission’s affairs effectively – These Regulations are essential tools for ensuring the efficient administration and operation of the Commission – Focusing narrowly on the nomenclature and the absence of an explicit provision for Regulation-making within the RTI Act would undermine the broader purpose and intent of the same – The nomenclature used to describe these Regulations should not detract from their necessity and their role in facilitating the 620 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Commission’s functioning – A purposive interpretation of Section 12(4) of the RTI Act reveals that the powers of “superintendence, direction and management” are intended to be comprehensive, enabling the CIC to adopt measures, including the framing of Regulations, that ensure transparency, accountability, and efficient handling of its responsibilities.
