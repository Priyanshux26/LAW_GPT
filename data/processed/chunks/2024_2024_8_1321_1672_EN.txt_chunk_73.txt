Justice Kuldip Singh adopted a different approach. The learned Judge held that the beneficiary classes in Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are different. Justice Kuldeep Singh observed that unlike the determination of the beneficiary class in Article 15(4) which must be socially and educationally backward, the class identified for the purposes of Article 16(4) need not be backward because: a. The Constituent Assembly Debates indicate that reservation under Article 16(4) is to provide access to communities that have not had a ‘look in’ at the administration of the State. The object of including the phrase “backward” in Article 16(4) - which did not find a place in the initial draft - was only for the purpose of reducing the number of claimants for the reserved posts;212 209 (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [58] 210 (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [117] 211 (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217, [Justice Thommen, 273]; [Justice Sawant 441,552] 212 (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [363] 1420 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports b. Inadequate representation in the services of the State is the only test for the identification of the beneficiary class under Article 16(4). Inadequate representation can be identified based on occupation, economic criterion, family income, political sufferers, b areas, backward areas, communities kept out of State services or any other means.213 The ‘backward class’ must be culled out from the classes which are inadequately represented;214 c. The backward class cannot be classified into adequately represented and inadequately represented. A class that is adequately represented cannot be considered backward. Reading the qualifier of inadequate representation with respect to the backward class would render the former expression redundant; and215 d. The Constitution has expressly mentioned the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes whenever the Constitution grants protection to the “weaker classes”.216 157. Contrary to the opinion of Justice Kuldeep Singh, which held that the determining character of the class in Article 16(4) is not backwardness but inadequacy of representation,217 the majority in Indra Sawhney (Justice Reddy writing for four Judges, Justice Pandian and Justice Sawant) held that the predominant factor which must be employed to identify the “backward class” must be social backwardness. The majority also held that the backward class in Article 16(4) subsumes the socially and educationally backward class identified under Article 15(4).218 Thus, the objective of both Articles 15(4) and 16(4) is to ensure substantive equality by uplifting the socially backward class. b. Inadequacy of representation in services of the State 158. The issue on the identification of beneficiaries which will impact the scope of reservation is whether the class is both backward 213 (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [368] 214 (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [364] 215 (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [366] 216 (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [367] 217 See opinion of CJ Ray in MN Thomas (supra) 218 (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [Justice Reddy,787]; [Justice Sahai, 583] [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1421 The State of Punjab & Ors. v.
