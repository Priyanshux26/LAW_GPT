On a harmonious reading of the inconsistencies in the provisions of the three different Acts, it is found that the general law must yield to the special law in the sense, that an arbitration agreement cannot be rendered void on insufficient stamping by a F general law, especially when none of the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1996 which is a special Act provide for stamping. The requirement for the “formal” validity of an arbitration agreement under Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would take precedence, considering the special nature of the Act and the principle of minimal judicial intervention. Applying the rule G of construction that in cases of conflict between a specific law and a general law, the specific law prevails and the general law like the Contract Act, 1872 applies only to such cases which are not covered by the special law; therefore, Section2(e), 2(g) , 2(h) of the Contract Act, 1872 cannot override Section 7 contained in H 294 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A the special law i.e. the Arbitration Act, 1996 when it comes to formal validity. Moreover, when the words of the statute in Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 do not mention “validity” or even “inoperable and incapable of being performed” as mentioned in Section 45 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 or “prima facie no valid arbitration agreement” in Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, B it must be understood that the general words in a different statute such as the Contract Act, 1872 cannot override the specific words used in the special law. That is to say, that an arbitration agreement cannot be rendered “void” on insufficient stamping by a Section 11 judge when the scope of examination is only limited to the C “existence” of the arbitration agreement and not “validity”. [Paras 79.1 & 79.2][473-B-F] 2. It is essential to interpret the special law in a way that gives effect to its specific provisions, while also ensuring that it is consistent with the general law to the extent possible. D Impounding at the stage of Section 11 would stall arbitral proceedings right at the outset because of the statutory bar under Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899. One way to harmonise Section 35 of Stamp Act, 1899 and Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 is for the Section 11 judge to defer necessary stamping E and impounding to the arbitrator/collector, as applicable.
