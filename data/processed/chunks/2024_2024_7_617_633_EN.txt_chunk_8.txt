The High Court noted that Regulation 22 exceeded the limits of the powers prescribed under the RTI Act and rules. It emphasized that the RTI Act required s to be pronounced in open proceedings, while Regulation 22 permitted s to be placed on the website or communicated to parties, deviating from the statutory requirement. This Court believes that a broader interpretation of the RTI Act is warranted. The general superintendence, direction, and management powers vested in the CIC imply a wide-ranging authority to organize the internal functioning of the Commission, including the ability to constitute benches. This interpretation aligns with the purpose and objective of the RTI Act, which aims to facilitate the efficient disposal of cases and the effective implementation of the right to information. 17. The absence of an explicit provision for Benches does not negate the CIC’s authority to constitute them, as such powers are implicitly included within the scope of the CIC’s general superintendence and management responsibilities. The broad language of the RTI Act indicates an intention to grant the CIC comprehensive authority to ensure the effective and efficient functioning of the Commission. The Delhi High Court’s narrow reading of the provisions overlooked the inherent powers of the CIC to manage the affairs of the Commission. The RTI Act’s broad language suggests that the legislative intent was to provide the CIC with the necessary authority to implement measures that ensure the Commission’s effective operation. 18. In the present case, the RTI Act should be interpreted purposively, taking into account the broader objectives of the legislation. The purpose of the RTI Act is to promote transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities, ensuring citizens’ right to information. To achieve these objectives effectively, it is essential that the Central Information Commission operates efficiently and without undue procedural constraints. The principle of purposive 630 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports interpretation supports the view that the CIC’s powers under Section 12(4) of the RTI Act include all necessary measures to manage and direct the Commission’s affairs effectively. This includes the ability to form benches to handle the increasing volume of cases. The formation of Benches allows for the efficient allocation of work and ensures the timely disposal of cases, which is crucial for upholding the right to information. 19. Furthermore, the High Court’s reliance on the absence of explicit provisions for Benches overlooks the broad language of Sections 12(4) and 15(4) of the RTI Act, which grants the CIC and State Chief Information Commissioners wide-ranging powers to manage their respective Commissions’ affairs. The legislative intent, as reflected by the broad language of these provisions, was to provide these officials with the necessary authority to ensure that their Commissions function effectively and efficiently. These provisions explicitly use the words “superintendence, direction and management” of the affairs of the Commission. There have been various landmark judgements of this Court which have interpreted the words “superintendence, direction, and control” occurring in Article 324 (1) of the Constitution in respect of the Election Commission.
