His contention was that merely because he had the duplicate key of the drawer where the documents were kept, he cannot be made responsible for any tampering. However, there was no answer to the finding recorded B by the Inquiry Officer in the Inquiry Report, namely, that the changed form of quotation of M/s. Laxmi Singh contained original signature of respondent no.1. The fact that this “Form of quotation” was changed is not in dispute. When the changed form of quotation also contained signature of respondent no.1, it clearly established his involvement in the C tampering of document. This fact has not even been noticed by the Division Bench of the High Court. 8. For the reasons mentioned above, the appeal is allowed. The impugned dated 28.2.2019 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court in Letters Patent Appeal No. 1593/2015 is set aside and the D dated 25.6.2015 passed by the Single Judge in CWJC No. 2176/ 2004 is restored. Nidhi Jain Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Rakhi, LCRA) E F G H
