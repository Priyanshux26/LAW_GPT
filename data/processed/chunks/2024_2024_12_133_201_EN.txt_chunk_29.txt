Accepting the explanation given by the respondent as bonafide and relying on the dated 15.07.2022 of this Court, the High Court held the fresh petition under Section 11(6) to be maintainable. 57. A perusal of paragraph 18 of the dated 10.01.2022 passed by the NCLAT setting aside the of the NCLT reveals that after invoking the arbitration clause by the notice dated 09.07.2016, the respondent issued a statutory demand notice to the appellant under Section 8 of the IBC on 30.08.2017. When no reply was sent by the appellant to the said demand notice, the respondent, rather than filing an application under Section 9 of the IBC, filed an application for the appointment of arbitrator on 16.02.2018. During the pendency of the application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 before the High Court, the respondent issued a second statutory demand notice under Section 8 of the IBC to the appellant on 25.07.2018. The appellant filed a reply to the said demand notice on 07.08.2018, wherein, inter 174 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports alia, it took the defence that there was a pre-existing dispute between the parties, which was evidenced by the existence of the pending arbitration proceedings. Subsequently, the respondent withdrew the arbitration application on 01.10.2018 and thereafter proceeded to file an application before the NCLT, Kolkata on 05.10.2018. 58. The chronology of events as discussed above clearly indicates that the respondent did not withdraw the first arbitration application because of some defect which would have led to its dismissal. It is also clear from the dated 01.10.2018 of the High Court permitting the respondent to withdraw the application that neither any liberty was sought by the respondent nor the court had granted any liberty to file a fresh arbitration application. It appears to us that the only reason the respondent withdrew the arbitration application was to get his application under Section 9 of the IBC any how admitted by the NCLT. It is also evident that the existence of a pre-existing dispute was brought to the notice of the respondent by the appellant much prior to the withdrawal of the arbitration application in reply to the demand notice issued by the respondent under Section 8 of the IBC. Thus, it can be said without any doubt that the respondent took a calculated risk of abandoning the arbitration proceedings to maximise the chances of succeeding in the IBC proceedings. 59. The respondent was within its right to abandon the arbitration proceedings in favour of IBC proceedings. However, having done so, it would no longer be open to it to file a fresh application for appointment of arbitrator without having obtained the liberty of the court to file a fresh application at the time of the withdrawal. We say so particularly because the withdrawal of the first arbitration application was not with a view to cure some formal defect or any other sufficient ground. The application was withdrawn with the hope that the application filed by the respondent under Section 9 of the IBC may succeed, as the pendency of the arbitration application would have proven to be an indicator of existence of a pre-existing dispute between the parties, and thus fatal to the IBC proceedings.
