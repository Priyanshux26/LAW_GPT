He has referred to another Arun (Arun Bhelke) in his statement, whom he had met while working for an organisation in C Chandrapur. He also declared himself as a party associate in his statement, and claims to have had been introduced to AF by another person. He has alleged that AF, Milind Teltumbde and Anil Nagpure had asked him to work with the said organisation. 14.VG has been earlier implicated in 19 cases for alleged crimes D under the 1967 Act, the Arms Act 1959, and the Explosives Act 1884. But it has been submitted before us on his behalf that he has been acquitted in 17 out of these 19 cases. In respect of another case, his discharge application is pending. He was convicted in Case No.257/11 by the Sessions Judge, Nagpur under Section 25 (1B) of the Arms Act E 1959, Sections 10(a)(i) and 13(1)(b) of the 1967 Act. There were charges against him also under Section 9(B) of the Explosives Act 1884, Sections 4(b) and 5 of the Explosives Substances Act, 1908 and Sections 10 (a)(ii)(iii)(iv), 10(b), 16, 17, 18, 20 and 23 of the 1967 Act and Sections 120B and 121A of 1860 Code. It has been emphasised by learned counsel for VG that his conviction is under appeal before the High Court, and F the offences for which he has been convicted do not fall within offences incorporated in Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act. The other case is Sessions Case No.261/10 pending before the Sessions Court at Surat. 15.The prosecution has referred to some letters alleged to have been recovered from the computers or other devices of the co-accused G persons in which activities of the two appellants have been referred to. We shall deal with these communications in the subsequent paragraphs of this . Under ordinary circumstances in a petition for bail, we must point out, this exercise of analysis of evidence would not have been necessary. But in view of the restrictive provisions of Section 43D H 900 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A of the 1967 Act, some element of evidence-analysis becomes inevitable. 16.The High Court in dealing with both these appeals had opined that the Investigating Agency had materials which prima facie showed that the applicants were part of a larger conspiracy attracting the offences contained in Sections 121A, 117 and 120B of the 1860 Code as well as B Section 18 of the 1967 Act against them. The High Court had invoked the allegations of recruiting cadres for the banned organisation, to import the provisions of Section 18B of the 1967 Act. It further invoked Section 20 of the same statute on the ground that the appellants had been active members of the banned organisation. In the same way, the view of the High Court was that Sections 38 and 39 of the 1967 Act were attracted C against the appellants. The High Court found that there were sufficient materials in the chargesheet against the appellants and there were reasonable grounds to believe that the accusation of commission of offences punishable under Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act was prima facie true in relation to both the appellants.
