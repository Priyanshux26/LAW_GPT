386. Similar to Article 29 of the Constitution of India, Article 27 of the ICCPR also restricts intervention in one’s culture.222 In this regard, since we have already analysed in detail that Section 6A per se does not intervene in culture of Assamese people, we see no need to re- agitate the issue here. In any case, it is an established principle that international law cannot trump domestic law.223 Therefore, Section 6A cannot be assailed on the ground of the perceived violation of Article 27 of the ICCPR as well. F. CONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTIONS 387. Drawing upon the comprehensive analysis presented in the preceding sections, we thus hold that Section 6A falls within the bounds of the 222 Länsman v Finland (511/92); Diergaardt et al. v. Namibia, Communication No. 760/1997 (25 July 2000); Lubicon Lake Band v. Canada, Communication No. 167/1984 (26 March 1990), U.N. Doc. Supp. No. 40 (A/45/40) at 1 (1990); Rakhim Mavlonov and Shansiy Sa’di case (Mavlonov v. Uzbekistan), Communication No. 1334/2004, UN Doc. CCPR/C/95/D/1334/2004 (2009) 223 Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, supra note 98. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1145 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 Constitution and does not contravene the foundational principles of fraternity, nor does it infringe upon Articles 6 and 7, Article 9, Article 14, Article 21, Article 29, Article 326, or Article 355 of the Constitution of India. Furthermore, Section 6A does not clash with the IEAA or established principles of international law. Hence, the constitutional validity of Section 6A, as contested before us, is resolved accordingly. 388. Nevertheless, it is imperative to acknowledge and address the valid concerns raised by the Petitioners regarding the persistent immigration in the State of Assam post 25.03.1971. Although Section 6A conferred citizenship rights exclusively to immigrants arriving before this cut-off date, there seems to still be an ongoing influx of migrants through various b States of India. Due to porous bs and incomplete fencing, this unceasing migration imposes a significant challenge. 389. On account of these concerns, we passed an on 07.12.2023 and directed the Respondent Union of India to provide data, inter alia, the estimated inflow of illegal migrants into India after 25.03.1971, the number of cases presently pending before the Foreigner Tribunals for such immigrants and the extent to which b fencing has been carried out. 390. Regarding the inquiry into the estimated influx of illegal migrants post 25.03.1971, the Union of India was unable to provide precise figures due to the clandestine nature of such inflows. This underscores the necessity for more robust policy measures to curb illicit movements and enhance b regulation. Additionally, it was disclosed that approximately 97,714 cases are pending before the Foreigner Tribunals, and nearly 850 kilometres of b remain unfenced or inadequately monitored. 391. We hold that while the statutory scheme of Section 6A is constitutionally valid, there is inadequate enforcement of the same—leading to the possibility of widespread injustice. Further, the intention of Section 6A, i.e., to restrict illegal immigration post-1971 has also not been given proper effect.
