[Paras 17, 19] Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 – Constitution of India – Articles 20, 21 and 22 – Right to be informed about grounds of arrest in writing – Purpose: Held: Any person arrested for allegation of commission of offences under the provisions of UAPA or for that matter any other offence(s) has a fundamental and a statutory right to be informed about the grounds of arrest in writing and a copy of such written grounds of arrest have to be furnished to the [2024] 6 S.C.R. 669 Prabir Purkayastha v. State (NCT of Delhi) arrested person as a matter of course and without exception at the earliest – The purpose of informing to the arrested person the grounds of arrest is salutary and sacrosanct inasmuch as, this information would be the only effective means for the arrested person to consult his Advocate; oppose the police custody remand and to seek bail – Any other interpretation would tantamount to diluting the sanctity of the fundamental right guaranteed u/ Article 22(1) – The Right to Life and Personal Liberty is the most sacrosanct fundamental right guaranteed u/Articles 20, 21 and 22 – Any attempt to violate such fundamental right, guaranteed by Articles, 20, 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India, would have to be dealt with strictly – The right to be informed about the grounds of arrest flows from Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India and any infringement of this fundamental right would vitiate the process of arrest and remand – Mere fact that a charge sheet has been filed in the matter, would not validate the illegality and the unconstitutionality committed at the time of arresting the accused and the grant of initial police custody remand to the accused – The plea of the respondent that there was no requirement under law to communicate the grounds of arrest in writing to the appellant is rejected. [Paras 20-22] Criminal Law – Arrest memo – ‘reasons for arrest’ vis-à-vis ‘grounds of arrest’ – ‘grounds of arrest’ cannot be equated with the ‘reasons of arrest’: Held: There is a significant difference in the phrase ‘reasons for arrest’ and ‘grounds of arrest’ – The ‘reasons for arrest’ as indicated in the arrest memo are purely formal parameters, viz., to prevent the accused person from committing any further offence; for proper investigation of the offence; to prevent the accused person from causing the evidence of the offence to disappear or tempering with such evidence in any manner; to prevent the arrested person for making inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to the Investigating Officer – These reasons would commonly apply to any person arrested on charge of a crime whereas the ‘grounds of arrest’ would be required to contain all such details in hand of the Investigating Officer which necessitated the arrest of the accused – Simultaneously, the grounds of arrest informed in writing must convey to the arrested accused all basic facts on 670 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
