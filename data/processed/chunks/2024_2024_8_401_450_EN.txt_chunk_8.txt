AFFIDAVITS DATED 20TH MARCH, 2024 AND 6TH APRIL, 2024 12. On 20th March, 2024, Acharya Balkrishna filed an affidavit, purportedly in compliance of the passed by this Court on 27th February, 2024. In the said affidavit, in one breath the deponent offered an unqualified apology on behalf of Patanjali for the breach of the statement recorded in para 3 of the dated 21st November, 2023 and in the other breath, tried to explain that the advertisement in question was meant to contain only general statements but inadvertently, included the offending statement and that the intention was only to exhort the citizens of the country to lead the healthier life by consuming the product of Patanjali. The contents of the aforesaid affidavit filed by Acharya Balkrishna are extracted below : “3. The Deponent regrets that the advertisement in question which was meant to contain only general statements inadvertently included the offending sentences. The same was bona fide and added in routine course by the media department of the Respondent No. 5 Company. The personnel of the media department of the Respondent No. 5 Company were not cognizant of the dated 21.11.2023.” 13. On perusing the aforesaid affidavit, this Court expressed its disinclination to accept the conditional apology tendered. At that stage, conscious of the fact that the aforesaid affidavit could not be treated as an unqualified apology, time was sought to file fresh affidavits. Thereafter, fresh affidavits were filed by Acharya Balkrishna and Baba Ramdev on 6th April, 2024 wherein, identical averments were made by them. The said affidavits stated that : “2.
