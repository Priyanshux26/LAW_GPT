Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act specifically provides that Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceeding in Court. However, as observed and held E by this Court in the case of Assam Urban, Limitation Act, 1963 shall be applicable to the matters of arbitration covered by 1996 Act save and except to the extent its applicability has been excluded by virtue of express provision contained in Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. [Para 8][380-D-E] 1.3 Now, so far as reliance placed upon Section 10 of the F General Clauses Act, 1897 on behalf of the appellant is concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that such a contention is untenable in light of the proviso to Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which specifically excludes the application of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 to any act or G proceeding to which the Indian Limitation Act, 1877 applies. Reference to 1877 Act will now have to be read as reference to Limitation Act, 1963 in view of Section 8 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Therefore, in light of the application of Limitation Act, 1963 to the proceedings under the Arbitration Act and when H BHIMASHANKAR SAHAKARI SAKKARE KARKHANE NIYAMITA v. 363 WALCHANDNAGAR INDUSTRIES LTD. (WIL) Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 specifically excludes A the applicability of Section 10 to any act or proceeding to which Indian Limitation Act, 1963 applies and in light of the definition of “period of limitation” as defined under Section 2(j) read with Section 4 of the Limitation Act and as observed and held by this Court in the case of Assam Urban, benefit of exclusion of period B during which the Court is closed shall be available when the application for setting aside award is filed within “prescribed period of limitation” and shall not be available in respect of period extendable by Court in exercise of its discretion.
