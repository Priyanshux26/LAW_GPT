However, the CIT (Appeals) and the Appellate Tribunal accepted the respondent Bank’s case. In this case, before the Appellate Tribunal, the department conceded in favour of the assessee. 27. In Civil Appeal @ Special Leave Petition (C) No. 7055 of 2021, neither the assessment officer nor the CIT allowed a deduction on account of the broken period interest. However, the Tribunal allowed the same. Before the High Court, Revenue argued that the increase in capital results in the expansion of the Bank’s capital base, which helps in profit making. Therefore, the expenditure in the nature of broken period interest was capital expenditure. However, The High Court rightly rejected the contention of the department that the outlay on the purchase of securities was capital outlay. 28. In Civil Appeal @ Special Leave Petition (C) No.7404 of 2021, the CIT, the High Court took a similar view. The same is the case with Civil Appeals @ Special Leave Petition (C) Nos.15281 and 1686 of 2021. 11 (2014) 366 ITR 505 892 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 29. In Civil Appeal @ Special Leave Petition (C) No.1687 of 2021 and Civil Appeal @ Special Leave Petition (C) No.8968 of 2018, the High Court allowed interest deduction on broken period. In Civil Appeal @ Special Leave Petition (C) No.24841 of 2019, though the assessment officer held that the broken period interest has to be capitalised, the Appellate Tribunal upset the said view. In Civil Appeal No.4755 of 2023, deduction for broken period interest has been allowed. 30. Hence, in Civil Appeal No.3291-3294 of 2009, the of the High Court cannot be sustained, and the decisions of the Tribunal dated 29th May 2003 and 15th July 2004 will have to be restored. All other appeals preferred by the Revenue will have to be dismissed subject to clarification regarding securities of the HTM category. 31. Accordingly, we pass the following : a. Civil Appeal Nos.3291 to 3294 of 2009 are hereby allowed by setting aside the impugned and the s dated 29th May 2003 and 15th July 2004 of the Appellate Tribunal are restored. b. All other Civil Appeals are dismissed. c. There will be no as to costs. Result of the Case: A ppeals filed by the Bank allowed and Appeals filed by the Revenue dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
