6 Supra note 3, para 9. H 1088 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 22nd May 2016. The court then proceeded to frame the scope of the remand in the following terms: “…To that limited extent, we propose to send back the matters to the tribunal. Therefore, these appeals are disposed of as follows: B (1) Citibank NA represented by its manager, Jeevan Bharti building 124 Connaught Circus, New Delhi will stand impleaded as additional respondent in the complaint before the Competition Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi. (2) the builder shall pay the compensation worked out at the C rate of 15 percent compound interest up to 30-04-2005. (3) whether there should be any compensation, and if so, what should be the amount payable after 30-04-2005, and whether the Citibank’s liable to pay in interest to the account holder (sic)by the Tribunal. D To the above limited extent we remit the matters to the Competition Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi. It will be open to the parties to take all available contentions in respect of the issues limited to, the Tribunal.” E 19. It is quite evident from the above that, with respect to the 30th April 2005 liability, this court had affirmed the findings of the COMPAT and also negatived the contentions of the complainant’s legal heirs to the extent that separate compensation other than compound interest was payable. The developer was therefore directed to pay as a measure of F compensation compound interest at 15% per annum for the entire period, i.e., 1993 to 2005. Since this court was apprised of the fact that the complainant had deposited the Pay before the MRTP Commission, it thought it appropriate to call for details from Citibank. After considering the affidavit and the materials placed before it, this court decided that the appropriate course would be to limit the matter to consider whether G for the duration after 2005, any liability could be attached to the developer. That was the rationale for the limited scope of the remand. 20. The materials on record would disclose that in this case, after issuing notice, the complainant returned the Pay received by her under cover of letter dated 7th September 2005, however, the developer H K. L. SUNEJA & ANR. v. DR. (MRS.) MANJEET KAUR 1089 MONGA (D) THROUGH HER LR [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] (in response to the complainant’s notice), by letter dated 26th September A 2005, denied the allegations contained in the notice and also returned the Pay for ` 4,53,750/- and the banker’s cheque for ` 1 lakh. It is also evident that on 7th October 2005, the complaint was filed. A copy of the complaint is on record. Curiously, it contains no mention of the Pay , nor does it say that the complainant filed the Pay in original B along with the pleading. This is an undeniable fact. Even the counter affidavit filed by the complainant in the developer’s appeal states that she: “Bonafidely also deposited the Pay s dated 30-04-2005 in the registry along with the complaint under protest in C court.” 21.
