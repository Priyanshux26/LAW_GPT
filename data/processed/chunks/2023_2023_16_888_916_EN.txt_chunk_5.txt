As for the doctors working in the Ministry of Health and Ministry of AYUSH, they were discharging clinical duties and since they were barred from private practice, NPA was granted to them. As regards further status of the case, learned counsel for the respondent No.4 submitted that the same was challenged by fi ling W.P. (C) No.12660 of 2019 in the High Court, which was disposed of as withdrawn vide dated 15.03.2023 with liberty to the respondent No.4 to fi le a representation before the competent authority. 23. In the aforesaid factual matrix, the arguments raised by the learned senior counsel for the appellants are that the respondent no.4 could not have been taken back in service in CSTT, after he had served on diff erent posts in various departments in the Directorate of Medical and Health Services, Daman and Diu, followed by the Directorate of ISM&H, Puducherry and thereafter in the CCRAS, New Delhi, an autonomous body, as his lien on the post had already been lost. Secondly, grant of higher pay-scale to the respondent no.4 was totally illegal. The post of which the pay-scale was granted to the respondent No.4, was of doctors, who were discharging clinical duties in hospitals. The case of the respondent No.4 was not similar. In fact, a wrong paragraph from the recommendations of the Commission was relied upon to grant him benefi t. Thirdly, one of the offi cers recruited and working in the same cadre and governed by the same Rules, was made ex-cadre without there being any legal justifi cation therefor and without following the due process of law. Even in the creating a separate 16 O.A. No.3062 of 2017 DR. P.N. SHUKLA AND OTHERS v. UNION OF INDIA AND 897 OTHERS [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] cadre for the respondent No.4, the only reason assigned was that he had been granted a higher pay-scale. The prayer made by the appellants is that the s passed by the High Court and the Tribunal be set aside, the prayers made by the appellants in the Application17 fi led before the Tribunal be granted and as a consequence thereof, s dated 13.12.2006 and 20.04.2007 issued by the Directorate be set aside or in the alternative, the appellants being governed by the same set of Rules and discharging the same functions, be granted the same pay-scales and allowances as has been granted to the respondent No.4. 24. Learned counsel appearing for the Union of India, submitted that after being selected as an Ayurvedic Physician in Directorate of ISM&H, Government of Puducherry, in the pay scale of ₹8000-13500, the respondent No.4 was relieved from CSTT w.e.f. 10.06.2005. However, his lien was maintained. After being relieved from the Di rectorate of ISM&H, Puducherry on 21.07.2005, respondent NO. 4 joined back in CSTT on 22.07.2005. He was again relieved on 05.09.2005 as he was selected as a Medical Offi cer (Ayurveda) in the Directorate of Daman and Diu, Medical and Health Services in the pay scale of ₹8000-13500. Even at that time, his lien was maintained in the CSTT.
