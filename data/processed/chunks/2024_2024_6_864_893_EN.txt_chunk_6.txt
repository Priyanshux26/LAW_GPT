4. The learned Additional Solicitor General Mr S V Raju submitted that: (a) Once an accused appears before the Special Court, he is deemed to be in its custody. Though Section 437 of the CrPC may not apply, the accused must apply for bail under Section 439 of the CrPC; 3 [2022] 10 SCR 351 : (2022) 10 SCC 51 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 873 Tarsem Lal v. Directorate of Enforcement Jalandhar Zonal Office (b) A Special Court takes cognizance of an offence under Section 4 of the PMLA based on a complaint only if a prima facie case of commission of the offence is made out. When the accused applies for bail under Section 439 of the CrPC, after cognizance is taken, the conditions incorporated in Section 45 (1) of the PMLA will apply to the bail application; (c) An application made by the accused for furnishing bonds in terms of Section 88 is an application for grant of bail; therefore, Section 45 (1) of the PMLA will apply even to such application; (d) The guidelines issued in the case of Satender Kumar Antil 3, do not apply to special acts like the PMLA; (e) After cognizance is taken on a complaint under Section 44 (1) (b), the ED has the right to make further investigation and file a supplementary complaint. For that purpose, the ED can always exercise its power under Section 19 of the PMLA to arrest the accused against whom the complaint is filed; (f) Though an accused against whom an allegation of commission of an offence punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA is made can apply for grant of anticipatory bail, such application shall also be governed by the conditions in Section 45 (1). Relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.4, it is submitted that money laundering is an offence against the nation. Therefore, taking into consideration the gravity and severity of the offence under the PMLA, mandatory compliance with the requirements of Section 45 (1) must always be ensured; (g) In view of Section 65, read with Section 71 of the PMLA, the provisions of the PMLA will have an overriding effect over the provisions of the CrPC; and (h) In none of these cases, the conditions incorporated under Section 45 (1) of the PMLA have been fulfilled; therefore, the appellants are disentitled to grant of anticipatory bail. 4 [2022] 6 SCR 382 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 929 874 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
