28 crores. c) Percentage of Depreciation: - 62. The next facet of the submission is that even if the value was to be taken as Rs.20.09 Crores of the property, the depreciation should have been computed at 32% as was mentioned in the report of the surveyors dated 11.12.2001. No doubt in the 11.12.2001 report of the joint surveyors while calculating depreciated value basis, 32% was taken by the surveyors but even this report carried a number of disclaimers. First of all, the surveyors state that the report is issued without prejudice and they extract the interim survey report of 04.02.1999. The surveyors set out in para 5.21 as follows: “Loss Assessment on Depreciation Basis (a) It is understood that Insured have not yet completed repairs/reinstatement. The delay in the process was Insured’s desired to have additional fund to proceed with repairs, which of course is not warranted under the policy. (b) Insurer had several issued to be resolved before advising us in November 2001 to proceed with final assessment of loss. (c) Pending reinstatement, we have assessed the loss on depreciated value basis under summary of assessed loss.” 63. As is clear from the above, the NIACL has several issues to be resolved before advising the surveyors to proceed with the assessment in November, 2001 and that pending reinstatement they [2024] 5 S.C.R. 313 New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v. M/s Tata Steel Ltd. had assessed the loss on depreciated value basis. After this report of 11.12.2001, it was the Insured who tried to open the matter again by writing a letter of 27.03.2002 stating that they had already installed a new Cold Rolling Mill. Strangely, this was after the admitted letter of 28.06.2001 by M/s Flat Products stating that they are not in a position to repair the 20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill since the experts have left the company. However, by the letter of 27.03.2002, the Insured wanted to treat the purported installation of 6 Hi Cold Rolling Mill as a valid reinstatement to stake a claim on reinstatement value basis. This claim of the NIACL is that particulars were sought for on 03.05.2002 and 24.06.2002 and the Insured on 09.07.2002 sought two weeks’ time to submit the information, but nothing was forthcoming, resulting in the surveyors writing to the Insured again on 07.08.2002. It was in this background that NIACL wrote the letter of 12.11.2002 in the following terms: “With reference to the above, we have noted that the insured are unable to produce invoices to establish the actual cost and age of the Mill affected in the said occurrence. As considerable time has elapsed and since the insured has not been able to establish and substantiate their claim, we may consider the claim on depreciated value basis taking into account the maximum depreciation applicable to such Mill. As such, we request you to let us have our working on the above lines to enable us to put up the matter to the competent authority for their consideration.” 64.
