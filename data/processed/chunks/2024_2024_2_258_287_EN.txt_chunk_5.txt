NCLT’s 10. The NCLT, vide dated 5.4.2021, rejected the aforesaid applications, inter alia, on the ground that, despite lapse of seven months between the date of filing its claim in January, 2020 and the date of approval of the plan in August 2020, the appellant took no steps against the RP for not taking a decision on its claim, even though it was aware about initiation of the CIRP, and now it is not permissible to take a decision on the claim application of the appellant as the CIRP is complete consequent to approval of the plan. Appeal before NCLAT 11. Aggrieved with the of the NCLT, the appellant filed an appeal before the NCLAT, inter alia, on the following grounds: (i) The appellant was a financial creditor and, therefore, ought to have been a member of the COC. On account of absence of the appellant in the COC, the approval of the resolution plan by the COC and, thereafter, by the NCLT is rendered invalid; 9 CIRP Regulations 2016 266 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (ii) By virtue of Sections 1310, 13A11and 1412of the 1976 Act, the appellant had a charge over the assets of the CD and was therefore a secured creditor within the meaning of Section 3(30)13 read with Section 3(31)14 of the IBC, yet the resolution plan does not treat the appellant as a secured creditor; (iii) The appellant had submitted its claim with proof, yet the appellant was shown as one who submitted no claim. Additionally, the appellant was neither informed of the meetings of the COC nor adequate amount, commensurate to its status as a secured creditor and owner of the land with statutory rights, was allocated to it in the resolution plan, which is violative of the provisions of Section 30(2)15 of the IBC; and 10 Section 13.- Imposition of penalty and mode of recovery of arrears.- Where any transferee makes any default in the payment of any consideration money or instalment thereof or any other amount due on account of the transfer of any site or building by the Authority or any rent due to the Authority in respect of any lease, or where any transfer or occupier makes any default in payment of any amount of fee or tax levied under this Act the Chief Executive Officer may direct that in addition to the amount of arrears, a further sum not exceeding that amount shall be recovered from the transferee or occupier, as the case may be, by way of penalty. 11 Section 13.A- Any amount payable to the Authority under Section 13 shall constitute a charge over the property and may be recovered as arrears of land revenue or by attachment and sale of property in the manner provided under Sections 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 512, 513, and 514 of the Ut- tar Pradesh Municipal Corporations Act, 1959 [Act 2 of 1959] and such provisions of the said Act shall mutatis mutandis apply to the recovery of dues of an authority as they apply to the recovery of a tax due to a Municipal Corporation, so however, that references in the aforesaid Sections of the said Act to “Municipal Commissioner”, “Corporation Officer” and “Corporation” shall be construed as references to “Chief Executive Officer” and “Authority” respectively: provided that more than one modes of recovery shall not be commenced or continued simultaneously 12 Section 14.- Forfeiture for breach of conditions of transfer.- (1) in the case of non-payment of consider- ation money or any installment thereof on account of the transfer by the Authority of any site or building or in case of breach of any condition of such transfer or breach of any rules or regulations made under this Act, the Chief Executive Officer may resume the site or building so transferred and may further forfeit the whole or any part of the money, if any, paid in respect thereof.
