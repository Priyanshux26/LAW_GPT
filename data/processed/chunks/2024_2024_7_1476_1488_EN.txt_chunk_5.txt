Act to compound the offence under Section 138, N.I. Act, run contrary to the law enunciated by this Court on the said question. In the light of the decisions of this Court in Damodar S. Prabhu v. Sayed Babalal H. [(2010) 5 SCC 663], K.M. Ibrahim v. K.P. Mohammed & Anr. [(2010) 1 SCC 798] and O.P. Dholakia v. State of Haryana & Anr. [(2000) 1 SCC 762], there cannot be any doubt with regard to the position that offence under Section 138, N.I. Act could be compounded under Section 147, N.I. Act, at any stage of the proceedings. 14. As relates the requirement of ‘consent’ for compounding offence under Section 138, N.I. Act, by invoking the power under Section 147, N.I. Act, it is to be noted that the question is no longer res integra. This Court in the decision in JIK Industries Ltd. & Ors v. Amarlal V.Jumani & Anr. [(2012) 3 SCC 255] declined to accept the contention that in view of the non-obstante clause in Section 147, NI Act, which is a special statute, the requirement of consent of the person compounding the offence under Section 138, N.I. Act, is not required. After extracting provision under Section 147, N.I. Act, this Court in JIK Industries Ltd. case (supra) observed and held in paragraph 58 and 59 thereof thus: - “58. Relying on the aforesaid non obstante clause in Section 147 of the NI Act, the learned counsel for the appellant argued that a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Damodar [(2010) 5 SCC 663], held that in view of non obstante clause in Section 147 of the NI Act, which is a special statute, the requirement of consent of the person compounding in Section 320 of the Code is not required in the case of compounding of an offence under the NI Act. 1484 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 59. This Court is unable to accept the aforesaid contention for various reasons which are discussed below.” 15. In the contextual situation it is relevant to refer to a recent decision of this Court in Raj Reddy Kallem v. The State of Haryana & Anr. [2024 INSC 347]. The said decision would reveal that this Court took note of earlier decisions of this Court in JIK Industries Ltd. case (supra) as also in the decision in Meters and Instruments Private Ltd. & Anr. V. Kanchan Mehta [(2018) 1 SCC 560] and in un-ambiguous terms held that for compounding the offence under Section 138, N.I. Act, ‘consent’ of the complainant is required. In Kanchan Mehta’s case (supra) even after referring to the decision in JIK Industries ltd. case (supra) this Court held that even in the absence of ‘consent’ Court could close criminal proceedings against an accused in a case under Section 138, N.I. Act, if the accused had compensated the complainant. It was held therein thus: - 18.3. Though compounding requires consent of both parties, even in absence of such consent, the court, in the interests of justice, on being satisfied that the complainant has been duly compensated, can in its discretion close the proceedings and discharge the accused.
