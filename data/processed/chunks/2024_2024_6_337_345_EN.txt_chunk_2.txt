The learned ASG has submitted that the timelines specified in Section 38(3) are only to ensure that interest is paid if the refund is delayed beyond the statutorily prescribed period. However, he has argued, the timeline cannot be used to denude the power to adjust refund amounts against outstanding dues under Section 38(2). The refund can be adjusted as long as outstanding dues exist at the time when the refund is processed, even if it is beyond the stipulated timeline.
