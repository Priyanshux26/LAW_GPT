It is relevant to mention that the of the Financial Commissioner dated 10th February, 1995 wherein it was observed “land in dispute ed to be vested in Gaon Sabha” was never challenged by F the appellants whereas the respondents challenged the dated 10th February, 1995 by filing Writ Petition (civil) No. 670 of 1995 before the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court which came to be dismissed by dated 14th July, 2008 and that became the subject matter of challenge at the instance of the respondents assailing in LPA No. 591 of G 2008. 5. The Division Bench of the High Court returned a finding that once the notification dated 23rd April, 1982 has been published in exercise of power under Section 507(a) of the Act, 1957 which expressly urbanizes the subject land in question and brings within the scope and H 262 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A ambit of Act, 1957, it no more remains rural area thus, all proceedings under the Act, 1954 stand non est leaving the parties to agitate their claims/disputes before appropriate fora with a clarification that all the pleas in law shall remain available to the parties before the appropriate fora which may be adopted for redressal of grievance under impugned dated 22nd November, 2012 which is a subject matter of B challenge in appeal before us. 6.

Subsequently, by dated 2nd September, 1992, this Court directed the concerned SHO to hand over D possession to the appellants herein and pursuant to of this Court, the appellants are in possession of the subject land in question. 7. The main thrust of submission of Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel for the appellants is that apart from the passed by this Court dated 2nd September, 1992 to hand over possession of the E subject land to the appellants, it can further be supported from the notice issued under Section 81 by SDM to the present appellants dated 18th January, 1984 which indicates that the appellants are in possession. 8. Learned counsel further submits that once Maman Singh had sold the land by registered sale deed in favour of Bhai Ram on 9th March, 1970 and handed over possession thereof, he (Maman Singh) had no F right, title and interest to execute the successive sale deed and he could not hand over possession to the respondents of the subject land.
