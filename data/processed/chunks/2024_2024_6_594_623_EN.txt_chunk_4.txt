478, admeasuring 11686 sq. yds./9771 sq. mts., and Final Plot No. 463, admeasuring 3890 sq. yds./3252 sq. mts. The vacant possession of Final Plot No. 478 was delivered to the plaintiffs’ father but the Corporation failed to deliver possession of Final Plot No. 463 owing to its occupation by slum dwellers. Town Planning Scheme No. 6 was varied thereafter in 1983 but without any alternative plot being allotted in lieu of Final Plot No. 463. The Corporation then prepared a second varied scheme in the year 1986, viz., Town Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi (second varied), which came into force on 26.04.1991. Thereunder, Final Plot No. 463 was taken back for the purpose of slum upgradation and the plaintiffs were offered Final Plot No. 187, admeasuring 2724 sq. yds./2278 sq. mts. In effect, the land allotment in their favour was reduced by 974 sq. mts., when compared with the area of the initially allotted plot. The plaintiffs claimed that they were offered meagre compensation @ ₹25/- per sq. mt. for the deducted area of 974 sq. mts, though the value of the land in 1991 was about ₹6000/- per sq. mt. in Paldi area. Even after the second variation of the scheme, in which Final Plot No. 187 was allotted to them, the Corporation failed to give vacant possession thereof, due to litigation between the Corporation 600 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and the occupant of the said plot. Ultimately, the Corporation was able to handover possession of Final Plot No. 187 to them only on 31.01.1996, after the litigation came to an end. Thus, from 01.08.1963, the date on which Town Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi (Principal Scheme), came into force, the plaintiffs were deprived of possession and enjoyment of 3890 sq. yds. of land, as was promised initially, as the Corporation was not in a position to allot the said land to them and on 31.01.1996, they were finally delivered possession of Final Plot No. 187 admeasuring only 2278 sq. mts. The compensation awarded to them for the shortfall of 974 sq. mts. @ ₹25/- per sq. mt. was an eye wash in view of the prevailing prices of land in Paldi area in the year 1991. The plaintiffs stated that they were, therefore, constrained to sue for compensation for the damages suffered by them due to the failure of the Corporation in discharging its duties under the Act of 1976. 4. Further, the plaintiffs pointed out that, in Town Planning Scheme No. 6, Final Plot No. 187 was reserved for construction of a school but the Corporation permitted one Pulkit Trust to use it as a playground in 1970. In the first variation of the scheme, Final Plot No. 187 was reserved for a Civic Centre. Litigation cropped up between Pulkit Trust and the Corporation and during the pendency thereof, the Corporation prepared the second varied scheme, whereby the plaintiffs were allotted Final Plot No. 187 though it was still in the occupation of Pulkit Trust.
