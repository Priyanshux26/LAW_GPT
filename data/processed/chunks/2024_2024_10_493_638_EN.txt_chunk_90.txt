The impugned provisions are also an instance of existing discrimination and targeting of the members of the Denotified Tribes. In a previous section of this , we held that the impugned provisions discriminate against the Denotified Tribes. Dr. Muralidhar argued that the classification of “habitual offender” needs to be completely done away with. At this stage, it is necessary to discuss how the classification of “habitual offender” was initially conceptualized. 214. The classification of “habitual offender” emerged prior to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act. Several Provinces had enacted their habitual offender laws. The Madras Restriction of Habitual Offenders Act, 1948 applied to individual habitual offenders.288 The Act neither required a notified offender to attend roll call to any authority nor provided for taking finger impressions of such offender.289 However, once a person was notified under the Act to be a habitual offender, “no opportunity” was given to him “to defend himself against s 285 Ibid, Sections 5(3), 5(5), 6(3), 26(2), 26(3) 286 Ibid, Section 27(3) 287 Ibid, Section 28(5) 288 The Criminal Tribes Enquiry Committee Report (1949-50), https://ia802807.us.archive.org/11/items/dli. csl.944/944.pdf, p. 92 289 Ibid, p. 93 626 [2024] 10 S.C.R.

Contrary to the Criminal Tribes Act or the Madras Restriction of Habitual Offenders Act, the Bombay Habitual Offenders Restriction Act, 1947 granted power to only competent courts to pass restrictive s after necessary legal proceedings. Under the Madras law, such s could be passed by government or officers authorised by them.290 215. The Rajasthan Habitual Criminals (Registration and Regulation) Act, 1950 defined “habitual criminal” as “a person who being a member of a notified tribe” who within the prescribed period, has not “been declared by an in writing of the District Magistrate as no longer a habitual criminal”. Further, it included “a person, who whether he was a member of a notified tribe or not, has within any period of ten years following the aforesaid date, been convicted not less than thrice of any of the offences specified”.291 The Rajasthan Act gave “too much discretion” to the District Magistrate.292 A biased officer may never declare any members of a Criminal Tribe as “no longer habitual criminals” even if they may not have any convictions at all.293 The Rajasthan Act was “hardly any improvement” from the Criminal Tribes Act.294 216. The Criminal Tribes Enquiry Committee, while recommending the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act, suggested enactment of a central habitual offender legislation. However, it stated that “a person should not be branded as a habitual offender merely on grounds of suspicion”.295 In his oral evidence before the Committee, a deputy inspector general rank officer from Bihar stated, “In some of the democratic countries of the world, the surveillance kept over even hardened criminals is not done in the way in which we do it India, and a time should come when no criminal should know that he is really being followed or pursued”.296 The Committee recommended that “a person who has been convicted twice for any non-bailable 290 Ibid, p. 94 291 Ibid 292 Ibid 293 Ibid 294 Ibid, p. 95 295 Ibid, p. 96 296 Ibid, p. 97 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
