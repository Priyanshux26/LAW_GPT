Mother Provincial was cited – There being no reference in Anjuman-e-Rahmania of Very Rev. Mother Provincial, a binding decision, certainly the said decision of the Constitution Bench had not been placed before the bench of 2 (two) Judges by the set of counsel appearing before it who agreed with the bench on the question of (in)correctness of Azeez Basha – Also, there cannot be any comparison of chalk and cheese – The case dealt with by Azeez Basha and the one arising for decision in Anjuman-e-Rahmania were fundamentally different and in stark contrast with each other – Therefore, even on merits, there was no good reason to make a reference for being placed before a bench of 7 (seven) Judges which Anjuman- e-Rahmania ed. [Para 42] [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1667 Aligarh Muslim University v. Naresh Agarwal & Ors. Held [per Satish Chandra Sharma, J. ]: The bench of two judges in Anjuman-e-Rehmania & Ors v. Distt. Inspector of School & Ors. could not have referred the matter to a bench of seven Hon’ble Judges directly, without the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India, being a part of the bench.
