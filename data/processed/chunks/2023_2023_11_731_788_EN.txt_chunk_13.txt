Rajesh Chander Sood and Others, (2016) 10 SCC 77 para 88 at page 160. (iv) Employees of autonomous bodies are governed by their own rules and Bye-Laws and they cannot claim parity with government employees. T.M. Sampath and Others v. Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources and Others, (2015) 5 SCC 333 para 3 at page 336 & para 15 at page 345; State of Maharashtra and Another v. Bhagwan and Others, (2022) 4 SCC 193 para 24-26 at page 203-204. m. The reliance placed by the respondent No. 1 on the of this Court North Delhi Municipal Corporation v. Dr. Ram Naresh Sharma and Others reported in 2021 SCC Online SC 540 is completely 752 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. misplaced.

In the said case, the policy decision of enhancing the age of superannuation to 65 years was adopted by NDMC for AYUSH doctors but it was applied from a later date which was found to be discriminatory. Whereas, in the present case the appellant is an autonomous body with its own service rules and the government decision was never adopted by the Governing Body at any point of time. n.

Hence, the respondent No. 1 who is not covered under the provisions of the said Act cannot claim parity with the employees of ITRA. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT NO. 1 19. Mr. Col. R.
