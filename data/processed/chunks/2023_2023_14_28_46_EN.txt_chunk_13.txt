In Park Street Properties Private Limited -vs- Dipak Kumar Singh and Another [(2016) 9 SCC 268], which was cited in the case of Sevoke Properties (supra), it was observed that in the absence of a registered instrument, the courts are not precluded from determining the factum of tenancy from other evidence on record as well as the purpose of tenancy. In this case, factum of creation of tenancy has been established. But the purpose of tenancy, so as to attract the six months’ notice period under Section 106 of the 1882 Act cannot be established by such evidence as in such a situation, registration of the deed would have been mandatory. The onus would be on the defendant to establish the fact that manufacturing activity was being carried on from the demised premises. A mere statement by the DW-1 to which we have referred earlier or the purpose of lease as specifi ed in the lease agreement would not be suffi cient to demonstrate the purpose of lease to be for manufacturing. This could be proved by explaining what kind of work was being carried on in the factory shed. In such a situation also, the registration of the deed would have been necessary. In absence of such registration, tenancy would have been of “month to month” character. For these reasons, we do not think the High Court erred in law in dismissing the defendant’s appeal. The present appeal shall stand dismissed on the same rationale. 46 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. 15. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. 16. There shall be no as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal dismissed. Divya Pandey
