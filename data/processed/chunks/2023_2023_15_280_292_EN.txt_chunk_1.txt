SUTANU SINHA & ORS. 283 / OF THE SUPREME COURT SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J. 1. Commerce has evolved. The documents forming the base of commerce have also evolved and created a hybrid nature of documents. Thus, what was earlier labelled as a debenture, now has hybrid versions such as partly convertible debentures, optionally convertible debentures and Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (CCDs). We may note that traditionally debentures were treated as a fl oating security with a covenant for payment on a specifi ed date.1 2. In the factual scenario of the present case, we are concerned with a Highway project in which the appellant has made investments through the CCDs. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had awarded the project in question in terms of a Concession Agreement dated 25.03.2010 executed between it and the IVRCL Chengapalli Tollways Ltd (ICTL). ICTL was in turn a subsidiary Company of IVRCL which was holding 100 per cent share capital of ICTL. A consortium of lenders had provided term loan facility to the ICTL to execute various documents including the company loan agreement dated 24.11.2010 and the balance project was to be fi nanced by IVRCL through equity infusion.
