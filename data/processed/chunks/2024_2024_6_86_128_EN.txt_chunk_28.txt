127 Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another that non-bailable warrants cannot be issued in a routine manner and that the liberty of an individual cannot be curtailed unless necessitated by the larger interest of public and the State. While there are no comprehensive set of guidelines for the issuance of non-bailable warrants, this Court has observed on several occasions that non-bailable warrants should not be issued, unless the accused is charged with a heinous crime, and is likely to evade the process of law or tamper/destroy evidence.30 47. Further, the observation that there is no provision for granting exemption from personal appearance prior to obtaining bail, is not correct, as the power to grant exemption from personal appearance under the Code31 should not be read in a restrictive manner as applicable only after the accused has been granted bail. This Court in Maneka Sanjay Gandhi and Another v. Rani Jethmalani32 held that the power to grant exemption from personal appearance should be exercised liberally, when facts and circumstances require such exemption.33 Section 205 states that the Magistrate, exercising his discretion, may dispense with the personal attendance of the accused while issuing summons, and allow them to appear through their pleader. While provisions of the Code are considered to be exhaustive, cases arise where the Code is silent and the court has to make such as the ends of justice require. In such cases, the criminal court must act on the principle, that every procedure which is just and fair, is understood as permissible, till it is shown to be expressly or impliedly prohibited by law.34 48. It is also directed that Manager Singh shall be released on bail by the arresting officer/ investigating officer/trial court on the terms and conditions to be fixed by the trial court in connection with the chargesheet originating from FIR No. 556 of 2019. The direction given by the High Court in its dated 09.01.2020 restricting the grant of anticipatory bail till the filing of the chargesheet is accordingly 30 Inder Mohan Goswami and Another v.
