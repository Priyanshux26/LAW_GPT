The State Government have decided to abolish the existing facilities of Time Bound Promotions and Selection Grades, discussed in paras 10 and 12 of F.D. Resolution No.6021 dated 18th December, 1989 and they shall cease to be applicable with effect from 1st January, 1996 and thereafter in the existing pay scales. If any such promotion, however, is due under the Rules before 1st January, 1996, it shall be given and the payment of arrears in the existing scale shall be made only upto 31st December, 1995 after which the promotion would be deemed to have been automatically terminated. While fixing pay in the revised scales, such promotions given after 31st December, 1995 will not be taken into consideration. If such promotions have been given after 31st December, 1995 then the question of adjustment of such additional emoluments obtained in the process, will be decided after the Fitment Committee submits its recommendations on promotion Policy. Promotion to any vacancy of a post identified as need based post would be admissible. The procedure for identification of such need based posts has been set out in paragraph 12.” (emphasis supplied) 5. The appellant superannuated from the post of ADSO on 31st January, 2001. At the time of retirement, the last pay drawn by the appellant was Rs.10500 in the pay scale of Rs.6500-10500 with admissible [2024] 8 S.C.R. 381 Jagdish Prasad Singh v. State of Bihar and Others emoluments. As per the Bihar Pension Rules of 1950, his pension was calculated at 50% of the average emoluments and was quantified at Rs.5247 per month. Accordingly, the pension as above was disbursed to the appellant from the date of his retirement. 6. It seems that the Accountant General, State of Bihar, raised an objection dated 28th January, 2003, regarding the promotion accorded to the appellant on 10th March, 1991 with a further remark that the promotion given to the appellant on 10th March, 1991 would become ineffective after 1st January, 1996 in view of the Government Resolution dated 8th February, 1999 and, thus, the pay scale of the appellant would have to be revised and reduced to match that of the lower post, i.e., the Marketing Officer. 7. After more than eight years from his retirement, the appellant received a letter dated 15th April, 2009 from the Government of Bihar conveying that an error had been committed in his pay fixation and, therefore, a sum of Rs.63,765/- had to be recovered from him as the same had been paid in excess beyond his entitlement. The letter directed the appellant to refund the aforesaid amount in one go or instalments. Language of the said letter is extracted below :- “With reference to the above mentioned subject it is submitted that after receiving the enquiry report from the enquiry officer of the departmental enquiry done against you and the analysis of the department, it has been decided that a sum of Rs.63,765/- has been paid to you in excess due to mistake in fixation of pay which is recoverable from you.
