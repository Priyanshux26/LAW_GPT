Article 245 read with the Seventh Schedule lays down the legislative competence of the State Legislatures and Parliament. Articles 15(4) and 16(5) recognize the power of the State to make special provisions for the advancement of the backward class, including the Scheduled Castes. These provisions permit the State to confer the benefit of affirmative action on classes where it is most necessary. Thus, the power of the State to sub-classify the Scheduled Castes for the purpose of affirmative action, including reservations, is traceable to Articles 15(4) and 16(5) in the case of educational institutions and appointments, respectively. vii. Criteria for sub-classification 149. The object of the special provisions in Articles 15(4) and 16(4) is to provide substantive equality to the beneficiary class.203 Inter- se backwardness within the class is a roadblock to achieving substantive equality. Sub-classification is one of the means to achieve substantive equality. But the crucial question is, what should be the rational principle to distinguish categories within the Scheduled Caste? Should it be based on the form of untouchability or any form of inter-se social backwardness? We will discuss the rational principle which must be used for sub-categorization in this segment of the . 201 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Hegde, 31] 202 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sinha, 90] 203 See NM Thomas (supra) 1416 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 150. It is important to understand the provision from the perspective of the beneficiary class for whose advancement it has been adopted, to elucidate the rational principle for differentiation. Though both Articles 15(4) and 16(4) share a similarity to the extent that they enable the State to provide affirmative action policies, there exist some dissimilarities in the language of the provisions. Firstly, Articles 15(4) and 16(4) deal with different spheres. Article 15(4) is a general provision which gives effect to the principle of substantive equality by recognizing that the non-discrimination provisions shall not prevent the State from making “any special provision” for the advancement of the beneficiary class. On the other hand, Article 16(4) deals specifically with matters of public employment. Secondly, Article 16(4) only deals with reservation while Article 15(4) recognizes other forms of affirmative action. Article 15(4) is broader and all-encompassing as compared to Article 16(4). Thirdly, the beneficiary class under Article 15(4) must be “socially and educationally backward” while the class under Article 16(4) is a backward class which is not adequately represented. The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are expressly carved out in Article 15(4), unlike Article 16(4), where they are encompassed within the “backward class”. 151. One of the issues that must be adjudicated while discussing the scope of the provisions is whether the beneficiary classes in Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are different. This issue must be decided with reference to: a. The use of the qualifiers “socially and educationally” backward in Article 15(4); and b. The use of the qualifier “adequate representation” in Article 16(4). a. The meaning of “Backward Class” 152. Article 15(4), unlike Article 16(4), provides that the beneficiary class for the purposes of the provision must be socially and educationally backward.
