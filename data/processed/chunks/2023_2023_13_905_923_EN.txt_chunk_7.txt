Once it is held that possession of the acquired land was handed over to BDA on 30-6-2001, the view taken by the High Court that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed due to non-compliance with Section 11-A cannot be sustained.” (Emphasis supplied) Submissions On Behalf Of The First Respondent 15. Per contra, on behalf of the fi rst respondent, it was submitted that once the High Court vide dated 03.01.1986 had allowed him to fi le an objection before the Competent Authority, any action taken prior to it became subject to further s in the proceedings that followed. In writ petition No. 9702 of 1987, there was an interim passed on 20.08.1987 directing that the original petitioner shall not be dispossessed from the land in dispute. This writ petition was disposed of without holding that actual possession of the surplus land was taken. Therefore, in the third round of litigation, when the original petitioner claimed that actual possession was never taken by the State, the burden was on the State to establish that possession was taken. The State not only had to prove that actual possession of the land was taken, but that it was taken in accordance with law. However, to discharge that burden, no proper documentary evidence was produced by the State. In these circumstances, the High Court was justifi ed in allowing the writ petition. 16. It was urged that, admittedly, there was no compliance of the provisions of Section 10(5) of the Ceiling Act, 1976 as 30 days’ notice was not given. Moreover, the memorandum of possession did not bear signature of the landholder. Further, no compensation was paid. Therefore, in absence of any concrete evidence to indicate that possession was taken in the manner permissible under Section 10(6) of the Ceiling Act, 1976, conferment of the benefi t of the Repeal Act, 1999 was justifi ed. 17. As regards delay in fi ling the third writ petition, the learned counsel for the fi rst respondent submitted that the High Court’s dated 28.02.2001 was already operating in favour of the fi rst respondent and the STATE OF U.P. & ANR. v. EHSAN & ANR. 917 revenue entries were also in his favour, therefore, cause of action to fi le third writ petition arose only when revenue entries were disturbed. Since information about change in revenue entry was received on 25.10.2012, the writ petition fi led promptly thereafter was not barred by latches. 18. In support of his submissions, the learned counsel for the fi rst respondent relied on those authorities which have been cited in the impugned in this appeal. Discussion And Analysis 19. We have considered the rival submissions and have perused the record. 20. Before we proceed further, it would be useful to recapitulate facts in respect thereof there is no dispute. These are: (i) On 26.11.1977, 5499.29 square meter of land of the fi rst respondent was declared surplus by the Competent Authority under Section 8(4) of the Ceiling Act, 1976. (ii) Notifi cation under Section 10(1) of the Ceiling Act, 1976 was published on 09.01.1978.
