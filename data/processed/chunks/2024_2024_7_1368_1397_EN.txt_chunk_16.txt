Public Service Commission in 1961. He was thereafter promoted to the gazetted class post of Assistant Regional Manager in 1981. His claim before the Tribunal was to the effect that pension, gratuity and commutation was sanctioned taking into account the services rendered w.e.f 05.11.1956 till 28.02.1983 leaving his earlier services from 19.04.1949 to 05.11.1996. Therefore, in view of Articles 350 and 370 of the Regulations, his period of service in temporary capacity or on temporary post was countable towards qualifying [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1393 U.P. Roadways Retired Officials and Officers Association v. State of U.P. & Anr. services for pension and gratuity and he was never absorbed in the services of the Corporation. Thus, the case of S.M.Fazil is entirely distinguishable on facts. 39. True it is that Shri Narain Pandey was granted pension by the High Court despite he having been appointed on the post of Junior Station Incharge on 05.05.1978. However, this was rendered without any reference to GOs dated 16.09.1960 and 28.10.1960 as also Note 3 of Article 350 of the Regulations and the provisions of the Service Regulations, 1981. This , therefore, cannot be relied upon as binding precedent as the same has been rendered without referring to the applicable GOs and Regulations. 40. In view of the above discussion, the appellant’s reliance on the s rendered by the Allahabad High Court in the matter of Mirza Athar Beg (supra), S.M. Fazil & 03 others (supra) and Shri Narain Pandey (supra) are misplaced as in the said matters, the respective appellants were found to be holding permanent posts which were pensionable whereas in the present case, the appellants were neither holding permanent posts nor holding any pensionable posts as per GO dated 28.10.1960. Therefore, s in the matter Mirza Athar Beg (supra), S.M. Fazil & 03 others (supra) and Shri Narain Pandey (supra) rendered by the High Court are distinguishable on facts. The in Shri Narain Pandey (supra) has not considered the legal effect flowing from the GO dated 16.09.1960 and 28.10.1960 as also Note 3 of Article 350 of the Regulations. Therefore, the said of the Allahabad High Court is of no assistance to the appellants. 41. For all the forestated reasons, civil appeal is liable to be and is hereby dismissed. C.A. No. 895 of 2020, C.A. No. 896 of 2020, C.A. No. 897 of 2020, C.A. No. 898 of 2020, C.A. No. (s) of 2024 @ SLP (c) of 2024 @ Diary No. 10240 of 2020 & C. A. Nos. 899-901 of 2020. CIVIL APPEAL NO. 895 OF 2020 42.
