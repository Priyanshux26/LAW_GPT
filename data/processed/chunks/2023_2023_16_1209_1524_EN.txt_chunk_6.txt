15 – Adoption: Held [per S. Ravindra Bhat, J. (for himself and Hima Kohli, J.)] (with Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J. concurring) (Majority opinion): This is not a case of delegated legislation being ultra vires the parent Act – The legislative choice, of limiting joint adoption only to married couples needs to be understood in the broader context of the JJ Act, and its purpose – which is the best interest of the child are paramount – The parent Act, and delegated legislation, both are clear that a prospective adoptive parent can be a single person (whether unmarried, widower, etc.) and on them, there exists no restriction other than on a single male being barred from adopting a girl child – The restriction of ‘consent’ of partner, applies only in the case of a couple –This is because the child will enter into a family unit – consisting of two parents, as a result of the adoption and will in reality, enjoy the home that is made of both partners – Acceptance, therefore, of the other partner, is imperative; it would not be in the best interest of the child if one of the partners was unwilling to take on the responsibility – Also, it is not a case for reading down or other interpretive construction – All marriages may not provide a stable home, and a couple tied together in marriage are not a ‘morally superior choice’, or per se make better parents – However, the fact that Parliament has made the legislative choice of including only ‘married’ couples for joint adoption (i.e., where two parents are legally responsible), arises from the reality of all other laws wherein protections and entitlements, fl ow from the institution of marriage – To read down ‘marital’ status as proposed, may have deleterious impacts – Reading down of the provision as sought for would result in the anomalous outcome that heterosexual couples who live together, but choose not to marry, may adopt a child together and would now be indirect benefi ciaries, without the legal protection that other statutes off er – making it unworkable – Regulation 5(3) of the CARA Regulations cannot be held void on the grounds urged – At the SUPRIYO @ SUPRIYA CHAKRABORTY & ANR. v. 1217 UNION OF INDIA same time, CARA and the Central Government should appropriately consider the realities of de facto families, where single individuals are permitted to adopt and thereafter start living in a non-matrimonial relationship – In an unforeseen eventuality, the adopted child in question, could face exclusion from the benefi ts otherwise available to adopted children of married couples – This aspect needs further consideration, for which the court is not the appropriate forum – No matter how much one empathizes with the outcome sought, the means to arriving at such a destination, must also be legally sound, and keep intact, the grand architecture of our Constitutional scheme – It is not that unmarried couples – whether queer or heterosexual– are not capable or suitable, to be adoptive parents – Given the objective of s.57 and other allied provisions of the JJ Act, which is benefi cial for children, the State as parens patriae needs to explore every possibility and not rule out any policy or legislative choice to ensure that the maximum welfare and benefi ts reach the largest number of children in need of safe and secure homes.
