A the even date of this Court in the case of Civil Appeal No. 5684 of 202110 and in the case of Civil Appeal Nos. 677-678 of 202111. 163. The other components, i.e. change in coal quality pursuant to amendment of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, and increase in Busy Season Surcharge and Development Surcharge on transportation B of coal by Indian Railways, have already been considered by us herein to amount to ‘Change in Law’ events. We have also considered the issue regarding ‘Carrying Cost’. As such, no interference is warranted in the concurrent findings by the learned APTEL, especially in view of the s of this Court.

CENTRAL ELECTRICITY 237 REGULATORY COMMISSION (CERC) [B. R. GAVAI, J.] the appeals have been filed only for the sake of filing the same.
