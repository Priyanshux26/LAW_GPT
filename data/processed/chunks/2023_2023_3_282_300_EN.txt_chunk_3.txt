A having made a representation to make the original appellant to believe that she had consented for the construction. [Para 19][298-A-C] 1.9 The entire circumstances revealed from the evidence on record unerringly point to the fact that the appellant had B encroached upon land belonging to the respondent and without bona fides effected constructions which is verandah which is extension of residential building. The object of estoppel, would be defeated if the said illegality is recognized and allowance is granted therefor. [Para 20][298-C-D] C 1.10 In a case where the owner of the land filed suit for recovery of possession of his land from the encroacher and once he establishes his title, merely because some structures are erected by the opposite party ignoring the objection, that too without any bona fide belief, denying the relief of recovery of possession would tantamount to allowing a trespasser/encroacher D to purchase another man’s property against that man’s will. In such a situation in the absence of any misrepresentation by an act or omission, the mere fact after making objection the plaintiff took some reasonable time to approach the Court for recovery of possession cannot, at any stretch of imagination, be a reason E to deny him the relief him of recovery of possession of the encroached land on his establishing his title over it. [Para 21][299- D-E, F-G] 1.11 No flaw, legal error, perversity or patent illegality is found in the findings on the substantial questions of law by the F High Court ultimately, in favour of the respondent and in setting aside the and decree of the first appellate court and also in restoring the and decree of the trial court.
