Haryana Civil Service (Executive Branch) Rules, 2008 – rr.7- 9 – Relevant cut-off date qua the eligibility condition of pending disciplinary proceedings – Determination – Disciplinary proceedings if were ‘contemplated’ against Respondent as on date of consideration: Held: r.9 does not contemplate a uniform cut-off date qua all the conditions of eligibility – 01.11.2018 was relevant only in so far as r.9(1)(a) (ii) was considered – For the purpose of r.9(1)(a)(iii), the relevant date for determining if there was any disciplinary action contemplated or pending against a candidate “is the date of consideration”, which is the date on which the Committee had recommended names to the Commission u/r.9(2), which, in the facts of this case would be 31.08.2019 – The reason for declaring the Respondent ineligible for selection as per r.9 was on the ground that decision had been taken on fi le to charge sheet him u/r.7 – At no point was it asserted by him that disciplinary proceedings were not contemplated against him – His entire case from the very beginning has been that the cut-off date 1046 STATE OF HARYANA AND OTHERS v. DINESH SINGH 1047 AND ANOTHER qua all eligibility conditions must be determined as on 01.11.2018 and since there was no decision/contemplation to initiate any disciplinary proceedings as of that date, he ought to have been recommended for appointment – The main allegation against Respondent was that on 05.01.2019 and 06.01.2019, he was directed to act as Duty Magistrate during the Haryana Teacher’s Eligibility Test, 2018 and he remained absent from this duty and thus, was negligent in performing his offi cial duties – The Deputy Commissioner, Kurukshetra wrote letter dtd.9.01.2019 to the Additional Chief Secretary and Finance Commissioner, Government of Haryana, Department of Revenue and Disaster Management in this regard and recommended that formal inquiry be initiated against the Respondent – In view of the same, a decision was taken on 05.02.2019 to charge-sheet him – It is not relevant to consider what happened beyond the date of consideration, that is, 31.08.2019 – However, subsequent to this date, there was a chargesheet issued against the Respondent and ultimately, the entire proceedings came to be dropped on 11.12.2019 – Since the eligibility conditions in r.9(1)(a)(iii), the validity of which is not under challenge, requires this Court to limit the inquiry into the question of eligibility as on date of consideration, what happens after that becomes insignifi cant to the inquiry – On facts, as on the date of consideration, disciplinary action was contemplated against the Respondent, and therefore he was rightly held to be ineligible for selection of his name in Register A-1 – of the Division Bench of the High Court is set aside and of the Single Judge is affi rmed – Service Law.
