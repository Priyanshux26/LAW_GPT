(v) Thus, the interest income earned on fi xed deposits made in the banks by the appellant Clubs has to be treated like any other income from other sources within the meaning of Section 2(24) of Income Tax Act, 1961. (vi) Conversely, if any income is earned by the Clubs through its assets and resources, from persons who are not members of the Clubs, such income would also not be covered under the principle of mutuality and would be liable to be taxed under the provisions of the Income Tax Act. (vii) In view of the above conclusions and having found that Bangalore Club does not call for reconsideration, we hold that the said which holds the fi eld would squarely apply to these appeals also. Consequently, the appeals are dismissed. Parties to bear their respective costs. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals dismissed. Nidhi Jain
