The application under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 for appointment of an arbitrator, was not maintainable in the present case, and consequently we uphold the impugned s dated 19.05.2022 and 25.11.2022, which held this position. We refrain from saying anything further on the matter as the dispute is still sub judice before the State Consumer Forum (Appellate Authority). 24. The appeals are hereby dismissed. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals dismissed. Divya Pandey 4 (2005) 8 SCC 618 5 (2021) 2 SCC 1
