The first part relates to the pre-award period from the date of the completion of the work till the passing of the award whereas the second part is the post-award period commencing from the date of the award till the satisfaction of the award. In the first part, simple interest @ 12% per annum has been awarded on the ‘amount awarded’ whereas in the second part, interest @ 15% per annum has been awarded referring to the ‘amount awarded’. The amount awarded in both the situations have to be the same and cannot be two distinct amounts. The ‘amount awarded’ refers to the principal amount of compensation awarded that is Rs.21,56,745/-. The award and the decree nowhere specifically contemplate for awarding 15% interest per annum on the amount awarded including the interest component i.e. the pre- award interest. This could not have been done even otherwise as there is no provision to that effect under the relevant statutes or the contract. No material has been placed before us or as a matter of fact before any court below to show that the terms and conditions of the contract contained any such provision. 28. In the light of the above discussion, we do not deem it appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the case to exercise our discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India so as to interfere with the opinion expressed concurrently by the two courts below. Therefore, the Special Leave Petition is dismissed. Result of the case: SLP dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
