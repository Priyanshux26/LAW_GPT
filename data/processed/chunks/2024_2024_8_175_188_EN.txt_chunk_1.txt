[Para 30] [2024] 8 S.C.R. 177 Rajasthan Agricultural University, Bikaner, Through Its Registrar v. Dr. Zabar Singh Solanki and Ors. Service Law – Regular appointment and re-designation – Distinction: Held: The very usage of the term/phrase “regular appointment” has to be given its proper interpretation and cannot be rendered redundant or superfluous – Here, there is a distinction between re-designation and regular appointment – Re-designation cannot be said to be a regular appointment as it is only that one post/ category/cadre which is given equivalence with another existing post/category/cadre, but the basic distinction would still lie that the re-designated post/category/cadre would always be considered to be an equivalent post of Lecturer/Assistant Professor, whereas the other/mainline cadre would always be considered to comprise only of direct recruits.
