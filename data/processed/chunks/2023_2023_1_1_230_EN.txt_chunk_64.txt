In our view, this will result in nothing else but absurdity and the very purpose for which the power is vested shall stand frustrated. An interpretation which, in effect, nullifies the purpose for which a power is to be exercised, in our view, would be opposed to the principle of purposive interpretation. Such an interpretation, H 86 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A in our view, rather than advancing the object of the enactment, would defeat the same. 152. Another line of argument that is sought to be advanced with regard to the submission that the power under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act has to be construed to restricting it to “one” or “some” B series of bank notes, is that the Parliament also meant the same inasmuch as on earlier two occasions i.e. in 1946 and 1978 the demonetization exercise in respect of “all” series was done by resorting to plenary legislations. Shri Chidambaram has taken us through various volumes of the history of the RBI. Perusal of Volume I thereof would reveal that, in 1946, it is not known when the Government Authorities started thinking C on the demonetization measure, but the final consultation could take place with the Governor and Deputy Governor. It appears that the RBI authorities were not enthusiastic about the scheme. It appears that in spite of the opposition by the then Governor of the RBI, Shri C.D. Deshmukh, the Government went ahead with the scheme and issued an D ordinance on 12th January 1946. 153. Further, perusal of Volume III would reveal that the then Governor I.G. Patel was not in favour of the demonetization scheme of 1978. However, in spite of the opposition of the Governor of the RBI, the Government went ahead with the demonetization scheme and issued E an ordinance in the early hours of 16th January 1978 and the news was announced on All India Radio’s news bulletin at 9 am on the same day. 154. It could thus be seen that on earlier two occasions, since the RBI was not in favour of the demonetization, the Government resorted to promulgating ordinances for the said purpose. F 155. It is to be noted that after the ordinance of 1946 was promulgated, the RBI Act was amended vide Act No.62 of 1956 and Section 26A was added, thereby specifically providing that no bank note of the denominational value of Rs.500/-, Rs. 1,000/- and Rs.10,000/- issued before the 13th day of January 1946 shall be legal tender in payment or on account for the amount expressed therein. G 156. After the ordinance was issued on 16th January 1978, the same transformed into an Act of Parliament upon the President of India giving his assent to the Act on 30th March 1978. 157. Merely because on earlier two occasions the Government H decided to take recourse to plenary power of legislation, this, by itself, VIVEK NARAYAN SHARMA v. UNION OF INDIA 87 [B. R. GAVAI, J.] cannot be a ground to give a restricted meaning to the word “any” in A sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act.
