The courts have to read the insurance contract strictly. Essentially, the insurer cannot be asked to cover a loss that is not mentioned. Exclusion clauses in insurance contracts are interpreted strictly and against the 1 Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sony Cheriyan (1999) 6 SCC 451 2 United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Levis Strauss (India) (P) Ltd. (2022) 6 SCC 1 366 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports insurer as they have the effect of completely exempting the insurer of its liabilities.3 17. In Texco Marketing P. Ltd. v. TATA AIG General Insurance Company Ltd.,4 while dealing with an exclusion clause, this Court has held that the burden of proving the applicability of an exclusionary clause lies on the insurer. At the same time, it was stated that such a clause cannot be interpreted so that it conflicts with the main intention of the insurance. It is, therefore, the duty of the insurer to plead and lead cogent evidence to establish the application of such a clause5. The evidence must unequivocally establish that the event sought to be excluded is specifically covered by the exclusionary clause.6 The judicial positions on the nature of an insurance contract, and how an exclusion clause is to be proved, shall anchor our reasoning in the following paragraphs. 18. Seeking to justify their repudiation, the appellant relied on the affidavit of evidence by Mr. S. Anantha Padmanabhan, examined as RW 2. He produced the surveyor’s report as well as the Expert Committee’s report as Ex. RW 2/2. On the other hand, the reports of the independent experts relied upon by the respondents no. 1 and 2 were not marked as exhibits. They were not adduced in evidence as none of these experts was examined as a witness. Under these circumstances, we have no hesitation in coming to a conclusion that the appellants have discharged the burden as enunciated in Texco (supra). 19. The Expert Committee was constituted by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (‘MORTH’), Government of India. It was chaired by the Director General (Road Development) and Special Secretary, MORTH. The other members of the Committee were Mr. Ninan Koshi DG (RD) & AS (Retd. ), Prof. Mahesh Tandon, Bridge Specialist, and Prof. A.K. Nagpal, Dept. of Civil Engineering, IIT Delhi. We have referred to the constitution as well as the expertise of the Committee only to assure ourselves that it comprised of 3 New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v.
