This however does not appeal to us and we are inclined to agree with the fi ndings of the Tribunal and the Delhi High Court that the classifi cation is discriminatory and unreasonable since doctors under both segments are performing the same function of treating and healing their patients. The only diff erence is that AYUSH doctors are using indigenous systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani, etc. and CHS doctors are using Allopathy for tending to their patients. In our understanding, the mode of treatment by itself under the prevalent scheme of things, does not qualify as an intelligible diff erentia. Therefore, such unreasonable classifi cation and discrimination based on it would surely be inconsistent with Article 14 of the Constitution. The of AYUSH Ministry dated 24.11.2017 extending the age of superannuation to 65 Years also endorses such a view. This extension is in tune with the notifi cation of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare dated 31.05.2016. 24. The doctors, both under AYUSH and CHS, render service to patients and on this core aspect, there is nothing to distinguish them. Therefore, no rational justifi cation is seen for having diff erent dates for bestowing the benefi t of extended age of superannuation to these two categories of doctors. Hence, the of AYUSH Ministry (F. No. D. 14019/4/2016-E-I (AYUSH)) dated 24.11.2017 must be retrospectively applied from 31.05.2016 to all concerned respondent- doctors, in the present appeals. All consequences must follow from this conclusion.” i. The appeal deserves to be dismissed with costs and directions be issued to the appellants to release the consequential benefi ts including arrears of salary for the period from 01.05 2018 to 30.04.2023 which would cover the entire period of 5 years of increase in age of superannuation. The respondent No. 1 worked from 25.04.2018 following the of stay grated by the High Court till 05.04.2021 when stay was granted by this Court following which the services of the respondent No. 1 were abruptly ended.
