Two revisions were further made to the entries as they appear in the Government of India Bill 1935 which were subsequently reflected in the Government of India Act 1935. The phrase ‘potable alcoholic liquor’ was substituted with the phrase ‘alcoholic liquor’ in the taxing entry and the phrase ‘liquor’ was substituted with the phrase ‘intoxicating liquor’ in the regulatory entry. The table below reflects the evolution of the Legislative entries relating to alcohol: Enactment Taxing Entry Regulatory Entry Devolution Rules ‘alcoholic liquor’178 White Paper ‘alcoholic liquor’179 ‘alcoholic liquor’180 Joint Select Committee ‘potable alcoholic ‘liquor’182 on Indian Constitutional liquor’181 Reform 175 List I, Entry 49 of the Revised Lists; See Joint Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform (Volume 1 Part I) 152 “46.

Before we proceed to lay down our inferences upon a study of the evolution of legislative entries, we clarify that the issue before this Bench is squarely related to the interpretation of the expression ‘intoxicating liquor’.
