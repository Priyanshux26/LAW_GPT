We also deem it appropriate to direct that the appellant, Union of India, will not charge interest on the amount to be recovered as they 10 (2015) 4 SCC 334 1532 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports themselves had made the payment and, the issue being debatable, to ask the employees to pay interest at this distant point of time may lead to difficulty both in calculation as well as in payment. 24. However, it is clarified that the pension and the pay scale, which are payable shall be re-determined on the basis of this and will apply prospectively with effect from 01.01.2025. 25. Where recoveries have been made from the retirees, the same shall be refunded. However, in the case of serving employees, where recoveries have been made, the same need not be refunded. 26. We also clarify that we have not made any comments or observations on any petition/appeal which is filed challenging the validity and legality of Clause 8.1 of the MACPS. 27. Pending application(s), including applications for impleadment/ intervention, if any, shall stand disposed of.
