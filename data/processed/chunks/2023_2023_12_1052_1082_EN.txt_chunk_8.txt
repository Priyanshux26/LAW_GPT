10. In the present case, we are not required to examine the inter-play and principle of proportionality with reference to clauses (a) and (b) to Section 529A of the Companies Act, albeit we must give full eff ect to and enforce the non-obstante nature of Section 529A of the Companies Act, whereby, notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of the Companies Act or any other law for the time being in force on 24th May 1985, on winding up of a company, the debt due to the workmen and the 17 Clause (c) to the proviso to Section 529 has been quoted subsequently. 18 The expression ‘Workmen’s dues’ in Sections 529, 529A and 530 of the Companies Act is defi ned and restricted under sub-section (3)(b) to Section 529 of the Companies Act. 1064 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. debt due to secured creditors as specifi ed, rank pari passu and are to be paid in the manner prescribed therein in priority to all other debts. 11. Section 530 of the Companies Act, which was amended and substituted by Act No. 35 of 1985 with eff ect from 24th May 1985, states that Section 530 is subject to provisions of Section 529A of the Companies Act. Section 530 of the Companies Act deals with preferential payments that are a level below the overriding preferential payments under Section 529A of the Companies Act. Clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the Companies Act confers preferential status to all revenue taxes, cesses, and rates ‘due’ to the Central or the State government or to a local authority on the ‘relevant date’ as defi ned in clause (c) to sub-section (8) to Section 530 of the Companies Act, which have become ‘due and payable’ within the twelve months next before the relevant date. The taxes, cesses and rates due to the Central and State governments or local authorities under Section 530 of the Companies Act cannot be given priority over the payments/debts mentioned in Section 529A of the Companies Act. It is, therefore, beyond debate that the provisions of Section 529A of the Companies Act prevail over Section 530 of the Companies Act. 12. We shall subsequently interpret the expression debts ‘due’ in the fi rst portion of clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the Companies Act and the words ‘become due and payable within the twelve months next before that date’ in the latter portion of clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the Companies Act, but at this stage, it is relevant to take on record the ‘relevant date’ as defi ned in clause (c) to sub-Section (8) to Section 530 of the Companies Act. As per sub-clause (i) to clause (c) to sub-Section (8) to Section 530 of the Companies Act, the ‘relevant date’ in case where a company has been ed to be wound up compulsorily, shall be the date of appointment or fi rst appointment of a provisional liquidator, or if no such appointment is made, the date of the winding up , unless the company had commenced to be wound up voluntarily before that date.
