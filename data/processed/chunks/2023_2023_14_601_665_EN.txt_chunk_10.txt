23. Diff erent medical opinions16, medical board proceedings17, and offi cial letters18 received by the appellant from respondents after his discharge from service, including the legal opinion of the command judge advocate, HQ SWAC19, having categorically admitted the connection between the appellant’s disability contracted due to reasons attributable to service and the blood transfusion of 10.07.2002, were relied upon. The appellant also challenged the disputed medical board proceeding dated 11.06.2014, which stated that the condition was not attributed to military services, by placing reliance on policies of respondents20, the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and rules thereunder including IMC Professional Conduct Regulations, and the guidelines for HIV testing along with ‘Standards for Blood Banks & Blood Transfusion Services’. 24. It was further argued that since the respondents have explicitly admitted that the appellant contracted his disability due to the blood transfusion, there is no need for further deliberation on the matter, as per Section 58 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872; an admitted fact need not be proven. 25. The appellant argued that the respondents claimed to have no records related to the appellant and the blood transfusion pertaining to the year 2002, stating that they were destroyed. However, they presented a receipt, issue, and expense voucher dated 12.01.2002 for two units of B-negative human blood, which was supplied by 166 Military Hospital (Blood bank) to 171 Military Hospital. The appellant questioned how the respondents were able to produce this document, which is available on record, after a gap of more than 20 years. The appellant also referred to Section 18B21 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and the Drugs and 16 Dated 24.5.2014 by the Surg Capt. Vivek Hande of HIV Physician/expert, INHS Ashvini, Mumbai. 17 Dated 12.12.2014, 24.6.2015, 21.12.2015. 18 No. Air HQ/99798/1/741570/DAV(DP/RMB) dated 14.12.2016 and 29.8.2017. 19 Letter no. SWAC/S1276/1/AD, dated 24.5.2016. 20 IAP-4303 & GMO-2008. 21 18B. Maintenance of records and furnishing of information. —Every person holding a licence under clause (c) of section 18 shall keep and maintain such records, registers and other documents as may be prescribed and shall furnish to any offi cer or authority exercising any power or discharging any function under this Act such information as is required by such offi cer or authority for carrying out the purposes of this Act. CPL ASHISH KUMAR CHAUHAN (RETD.) v. COMMANDING 617 OFFICER & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] Cosmetics Rules, 1945, which pertains to maintaining of the records and providing the information. According to this section, every person holding a license under clause (c) of Section 18 is obligated to keep and maintain prescribed records, registers, and other documents. 26. It was further argued that the CoI conducted by the respondents was with the participation of the Indian Army offi cers and witnesses, without involving or summoning the appellant. It appeared to be a mere formality as no documents were presented before this court. It was argued that this entire procedure was not only violative of principles of natural justice, and fair play but a ruse to discount the medical certifi cates and conclusions recorded which pointed to negligence of the Indian Army.
