Two months after the dismissal of the SLP, the petitioner fi led the present Writ Petition praying that a Writ of Mandamus be issued to the State to verify his claim of juvenility and to pass necessary consequential s. 4. As it is well settled that the question of juvenility can be raised before any Court and at any stage, as prescribed under Section 7A(1) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000, and confi rmed by judicial precedents2, this Court issued notice in the Writ Petition. The State fi led an affi davit through the Inspector of Police, PS Sathupally, Khammam District, Telangana, stating that the petitioner studied at the M.P.P. School, Putrela Main, Village of Vissannapet Mandal, Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, from First to Third Standard from 1994 to 1997 and his date of birth is 02.05.1989. Since the juvenility was based on the petitioner’s school documents, this Court considered it appropriate to direct the Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court), Khammam, Andhra Pradesh, to conduct an enquiry with regard to the plea of juvenility raised by the petitioner. The Sessions Judge was directed to conduct an enquiry and to submit the report after recording necessary evidence by summoning the concerned offi cials for the production of school records. 5. The High Court of Andhra Pradesh has forwarded the report of the II Additional Sessions Judge, Khammam, on the issue of juvenility of the petitioner. In the report dated 13.05.2023, the FAC II Additional Sessions Judge, Khammam, has categorically come to the conclusion that the date of birth of Makkella Nagaiah is 02.05.1989. The report is based on a detailed examination of the documents, Exhibits C1 to C7, coupled with the oral evidence of witnesses CW-1 and CW-2. We have no hesitation in accepting the same. 6. If the date of birth of the petitioner is 02.05.1989, he was 16 years 7 months old as on the date of the crime, i.e., 21.12.2005. Accordingly, the 2 Hari Ram v. State of Rajasthan & Anr. (2009) 13 SCC 211. MAKKELLA NAGAIAH v. 253 THE STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH petitioner was a juvenile in confl ict with the law on the date of commission of the off ence. 7. In view of Section 16 read with Section 15(1)(g) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000, the maximum period for which the petitioner could have been in custody is three years. However, as the plea of juvenility was raised for the fi rst time in the present writ petition before us, the process of criminal law, which commenced in 2005, led to the petitioner being convicted and sentence for life imprisonment concurrently by the Trial Court, the High Court as well as the Supreme Court.
