[Para 27] Societies Registration Act, 1860 – Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950 – Whether the private respondents had the locus to be heard before any forum or to file an appeal/petition against the of the Joint Charity Commissioner: Held: During the pendency of the appeal before the Joint Charity Commissioner all the seven objectors had died – The Joint Charity Commissioner decided in favour of the appellants and directed for accepting the Change Report – The contesting respondent preferred a petition before the District Judge – He was neither an objector before the Assistant Charity Commissioner nor a valid member of the Society – He would have no locus to maintain the petition before the District Judge – Although the contesting respondent claimed himself to be the Vice-President of the Society but has not been able to substantiate his claim – On this ground alone the District Judge ought to have dismissed the petition. [Para 29] Societies Registration Act, 1860 – Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950 – There were four signatories (Members 4 to 7 from the category of Employee Members) to the requisition calling a [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1065 Adv Babasaheb Wasade & Ors. v. Manohar Gangadhar Muddeshwar & Ors. General Body Meeting – From a perusal of the available record, it transpires that they had retired from service and even after that had continued to pay their subscription – Propriety: Held: In this context, the question that arises is that once the said Members were Employee Members, their categorisation as such was dependent on them being in service – On retirement, the said signatories would cease to be employees, come out of the category of Employee Members and their membership in the Society could not have continued – Upon superannuation or cessation of their employment, such four signatories could very well have been made members of the Society, but there is no indication on the record that they were made members of the Society by a specific resolution and thereafter continued as members and paid the subscription fee(s) – Thus, they could not have continued as members of the Society in the category of Employee Members even upon their superannuation by merely paying the yearly subscription fee thereby blocking the entry of the persons, who were still employees. [Para 34] Principles/Doctrines – Doctrine of Necessity – When an action is required to be taken under compelling circumstances – Applicability of the doctrine of necessity on the facts of the instant case: Held: There is a doctrine of necessity where under given circumstances an action is required to be taken under compelling circumstances – The use of the doctrine of necessity is to justify actions that would otherwise be outside the norm due to the urgent need to restore – In the instant case, had the Working President not convened the meeting, the elections of the executive body would have been in limbo for an unreasonable amount of time – The convening of the meeting by the Working President upon the requests by the 16 surviving members was a “necessity” at the time.
