Appellants prayed for a permanent injunction against the three defendants from interfering with the appellants’ peaceful possession of the suit property. c. Kazmi, sometime in 1990, initiated proceedings for declaration of rights before the Sub-Divisional Officer under section 229B of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 (“UPZA & LR Act”, hereafter); the said proceedings were, however, dismissed on 27th February, 1999 [4 (four) years after his death]. d. In the Suit, an application for interim injunction was filed by the appellants. The Trial Court on 31st May, 1990, allowed the application and directed Kazmi and Samiullah to maintain status quo with regard to the suit property, and directed them not to interfere with the appellants’ peaceful possession thereof. e. Kazmi filed his written statement in the Suit on 5th December, 1990 where he inter alia contended that the Suit was barred by section 331 of the UPZA & LR Act and not maintainable before a civil court since the suit property was bhoomidhari land. It was further averred that the Suit was barred by section 41(h) of the Specific Relief Act; he also contended that his son Samiullah, the defendant no.2, had no concern with the suit property as long as his father (Kazmi) was alive and, hence, Samiullah had been wrongly impleaded as the defendant no.2. Kazmi also denied that Khatoon Jannat Bibi had the right to make any oral gift; inasmuch as she had only a life interest in the property, after her demise, the same devolved upon him exclusively. f. It is to be noted that no written statement was filed on behalf 2 Original Suit No. 58 of 1990 [2024] 1 S.C.R. 525 Asma Lateef & Anr. v. Shabbir Ahmad & Ors. of the other two defendants. g. Upon the appellants moving an application under Rules 5 and 10 of VIII, CPC for pronouncement of against Samiullah, the same was allowed by the Trial Court by its dated 5th August, 19913, to which we propose to advert in course of our analysis. h. Subsequently, the Trial Court, on 10th October, 1991, framed 11 (eleven) issues for consideration in the Suit, of which the very first one was on its competency to try the Suit. i. Kazmi passed away on 15th July, 1995, after which his sons, Samiullah and Fariduddin [respondents 4 and 5 herein] transferred the suit property to the respondents 1 to 3 (“Purchasers”, hereafter) vide a sale deed dated 3rd November, 1997. The Suit against Kazmi remained pending even after his demise, and none of his other heirs or legal representatives were brought on record as substituted defendants. The Suit against Kazmi was finally dismissed as abated on 27th April, 2009. j. Appellants, as purported decree holders, filed an execution application4 before the Executing Court, on 16th December, 1997, praying that respondents 4 and 5 be punished for violating the dated 5th August, 1991 and that the sale deed dated 3rd November, 1997 in favour of the Purchasers be declared invalid.
