[Para 36] Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule – Stamp duty – Entry 91 of List I, Entry 63 of List II, and Entry 44 of List III – Distribution of legislative competence: 244 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: A combined reading of the constitutional scheme shows that the power to prescribe the rate of duty is mutually exclusive and has been clearly demarcated between the Parliament and the legislatures of the state – Insurance policies, which are the relevant instrument for the purpose of the present case, fall under Entry 91 of List I for the purpose of prescription of rate of duty – This means that only the Parliament holds the exclusive power and the legislative competence under the Constitution to prescribe the rate of stamp duty on insurance policies. [Para 12] Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 – Indian Stamp Act, 1899 – Constitution of India – Article 254; Entry 44, List III: Held: In the present case, the imposition of stamp duty by the state government was under the 1952 Act, which is a state law that has been enacted under Entry 44 of List III, and has received Presidential assent as contemplated under Article 254 – Article 254(2) clearly stipulates that when a state law with respect to a matter in the Concurrent List is repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by the Parliament or an existing law with respect to that matter, then the law passed by the state shall prevail in that state “if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent” – The 1952 Act that occupies the field in the present case has undisputedly received Presidential assent and hence it prevails over the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 so far as the state of Rajasthan is concerned. [Para 29] Tax/Taxation – Tax law – Plea that the rate of taxation is an essential component for a valid imposition of tax and since the State legislature cannot prescribe the rate of stamp duty on insurance policies, there can be no valid imposition of stamp duty on these instruments by way of a state enactment: Held: Rejected – Even if the State legislature cannot prescribe the rate of stamp duty, it can levy such duty at the rate as provided by the Parliament – In the present case, while it is true that the State cannot prescribe the rate of duty on insurance policies, that by itself does not mean that there is ambiguity or lack of clarity regarding the rate of such duty – Rather, the rate of duty is unambiguous, clear, and defined by the Parliament and is adopted by the state to levy and collect stamp duty. [Para 18] Constitution of India – Entry 44 of List III; Entry 91 of List I – Contention as regards whether Entry 44 of List III is a taxation entry: [2024] 5 S.C.R. 245 Life Insurance Corporation of India v. The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
