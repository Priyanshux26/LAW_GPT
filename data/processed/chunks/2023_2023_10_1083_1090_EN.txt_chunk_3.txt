This claim petition is also pending. 5. The Assistant Commissioner of Police took over further investigation of the case and submitted a final report before the JMFC, Paravur, Kollam, stating that the incident was an unavoidable accident; C that the incident had occurred because the Appellant’s son’s Alto car was trying to overtake a pick-up van and the driver of the van did not give way, and as a result, the car hit the van and thereafter collided with the tanker lorry. The final report dated 29.11.2019 is stated to be contrary to the earlier report dated 27.01.2016. It was stated in the final report that the incident was an unavoidable accident, not attributable to D negligence on the part of the Appellant’s son. 6. Being aggrieved by the said final report, Respondent No.1 herein filed a petition under Section 482 of the CrPC before the Kerala High Court praying that the investigation report dated 29.11.2019 be quashed. The said petition itself was filed two years from the date of the final E report. The High Court, by the impugned dated 31.03.2022, has allowed the petition filed by Respondent No.1 and quashed the final report dated 29.11.2019 wherein it has been observed that the incident was an unavoidable accident, not attributable to negligence on the part of Appellant’s son. Being aggrieved by the quashing of the said report, F the present appeal has been preferred. 7. We have heard learned counsel for the Appellant and learned counsel for the impleading applicants and perused the material on record. Respondent No.1 is served and has not appeared. It is noted that the quashing of the said report would have a bearing G in the criminal proceeding but having regard to the fact that the Appellant’s son also died in the accident, as against him, the criminal proceeding would abate. However, learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that Respondent No.1 unnecessarily filed a petition under Section 482 CrPC H 1088 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A for quashing the final report dated 29.11.2019 after a period of two years. In this regard, our attention was drawn to the fact that the earlier final report was filed by the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Kollam District Crime Branch dated 27.01.2016 for the offences under Section 279 and 304A of the IPC as against the Appellant’s son, although the FIR was filed against Ramar also, the driver of tanker lorry. In the chargesheet, B the investigating officer has stated that the chargesheet had abated as against the son of the Appellant herein. The Appellant herein had in fact made a representation for a thorough further investigation in the matter pursuant to which, further investigation was commenced in CC No. 215 of 2016 in Crime No.1 of 2015 of Chathannoor Police Station vide C dated 19.12.2018 of the JFCM under Section 173(8) of the CrPC. On further investigation taken up by the Assistant Commissioner of Police, a final report was submitted on 29.11.2019. It was two years thereafter that the first Respondent herein filed Criminal MC No.4870 of 2021 under Section 482 of the CrPC seeking quashing of the further investigation’s final report before the High Court without making the D Appellant or other affected party, a Respondent.
