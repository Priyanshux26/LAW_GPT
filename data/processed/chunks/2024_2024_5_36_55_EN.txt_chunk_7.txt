On the aforesaid application, the High Court, while noticing that offer made by the private respondents was not acceptable to the victim, directed the respondents to deposit the amount with the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Meerut. The relevant part of the dated 21.02.2024 is reproduced hereinunder: “Correction in the dated 12.12.2023, is sought to the extent that the applicants have already handed over the demand drafts in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Meerut, as the victim has not come forward to accept the drafts, the appellants, who are granted bail, are still languishing in judicial custody. 1 Criminal Misc. Correction Application No. 12 of 2024 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 47 Shivani Tyagi v. State of U.P. & Anr. It is further submitted that appellants have performed their part of liability by depositing the demand draft before the CJM, Meerut, thus they may be released on bail. In paragraph No. 11 of the dated 12.12.2023, we modify to the extent that the appellants may be released on bail, even prior to handing over the demand drafts to the victims as ed earlier. Notice of the application has been sent by registered post to Sri P.K. Rai, learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 by Sri P.K. Mishra, learned counsel for the appellants on 04.01.2024, but none appeared on behalf of respondent No. 2. Learned AGA has no objection to the prayer made by counsel for the appellants. The bail dated 12.12.2023 was passed in other connected Criminal Appeal No. 996 of 2021, Criminal Appeal No. 801 of 201, Criminal Appeal No. 1155 of 2021 and Criminal Appeal No. 467 of 2021. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, it is undisputed that the demand drafts have been handed over to the CJM, Meerut, the appellants be released on bail subject to furnishing of surety bond. The appellants will tender an undertaking before the Court that in case the victim appears subsequently and applies for release of money and in the meantime if the validity of the drafts have lapsed, they will revalidate the draft and hand over the same to the Court of CJM, Meerut. With the aforesaid observations, the dated 12.12.2023 is modified accordingly.” 5. Detailed discussions have been made in the opinion expressed by my brother C.T. Ravikumar, J. with reference to the suspension of sentence in case of heinous offences. I would like to touch upon the issue of offer of money to the victim for suspension of sentence in a heinous crime of acid attack, where the victim suffered burn injuries to the extent of 30 to 40% resulting in total disfigurement of her face. As is evident from the record, despite spending ₹ 21 lakhs (Rupees Twenty-One Lakhs only) on the treatment, she still has not been cured. 48 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 6. One of the principles of sentencing in criminal law is proportionality. If the appropriate punishment is not awarded or if, after conviction for a heinous crime, the court directs the suspension of the sentence without valid reasons, the very purpose for which the criminal justice system exists will fail.
