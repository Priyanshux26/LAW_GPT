In consequence, all incidents appertaining to the said Watans, including the right to hold office and Watan property, stood extinguished. Further, Section 3(c) provided that, subject to the provisions of Sections 5, 6 and 9, all Watan lands stood resumed and were subject to payment of land revenue under the provisions of the relevant Code, as if they were unalienated land. Section 5 thereof, however, provided for regrant of the Watan land to the Watandar. Section 5(1) stated that Watan land resumed under Section 3 shall on an application therefor, [2024] 3 S.C.R. 599 Baban Balaji More (Dead) by LRs. & others v. Babaji Hari Shelar (Dead) by LRs. & others being in relation to cases not falling under Sections 6 and 9, be regranted to the Watandar of the Watan to which it appertained on payment by or on behalf of the Watandar to the State Government of the occupancy price equal to twelve times the amount of the full assessment of such land within the prescribed period and in the manner prescribed and, thereupon, the Watandar shall be an occupant within the meaning of the relevant Code in respect of any such land and shall be primarily liable to pay land revenue to the State Government in accordance with the provisions of that Code. The proviso to Section 5(1) stipulated that in respect of Watan land which was not assigned under the existing Watan law as remuneration of an officiator, the occupancy price equal to six times the amount of the full assessment of such land shall be paid by or on behalf of the Watandar for the regrant of such land. 8. The appellants made an application under Section 5 of the Abolition Act for regrant of the Watan lands, as their case did not fall within the ambit of either Section 6 or Section 9 of the 1874 Act. By dated 27.11.1964, the Mamlatdar, Haveli, noted that they had paid an amount equal to six times the assessment on 17.11.1964; that a Certificate of the Talhati stating to that effect was also on record; and accordingly ed that the said lands be regranted to them, subject to conditions. 9. In the meanwhile, it appears that the tenants filed a revision before the Government assailing the s passed against them. However, the appellants claim that it was only on 11.12.1964 that they suddenly received a copy of the letter dated 10.07.1964 addressed to Damu Ganapati Tapkir by the Officer on Special Duty, Revenue and Forest Department, Government of Maharashtra, stating that, pursuant to Government Letter dated 01.11.1963, he was to state that the Government was pleased to set aside the dated 18.04.1961 passed by the Pranth Officer, Taluka Haveli, District Poona; the dated 27.03.1962 passed by the Collector, Poona, in Watan Appeal 6 of 1961; and the dated 12.06.1962 passed by the Commissioner, Poona Division, in Case No. W.T.N.P.6/33. Thereupon, the Collector, Poona, directed the Mamlatdar, Haveli, to ensure delivery of possession of the lands to the tenants.
