182 [1927 S4CR ]34 8 : (1974) 4SCC 3 183 [1982 1SCR] 7 9 : (1981) 1 SCC 722 184 [1928 S5CR ]28 7 : (1985) 1 SCC 641 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 542 Digital Supreme Court Reports In Sharma Transport v. Government of Andhra Pradesh,'® this Court reiterated Indian Express Newspapers (supra) by observing that the test of arbitrariness as applied to an executive action cannot be applied to delegated legislation. It was held that to declare a delegated legislation as arbitrary, “it must be shown that it was not reasonable and manifestly arbitrary.” This Court further went on to define “arbitrarily” to mean “in an unreasonable manner, as fixed or done capriciously or at pleasure, without adequate determining principle, not founded in the nature of things, non-rational, not done or acting according to reason or , depending on the will alone.” 184. While this Court accepted it as a settled proposition of law that a subordinate legislation can be challenged on the ground of manifest arbitrariness, there was still some divergence as to the doctrine’s application with respect to plenary legislation. In State of Tamil Nadu v. Ananthi Ammal,'® a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that a statute can be declared invalid under Article 14 if it is found to be arbitrary or unreasonable. Similarly, in Dr. K R Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu,'®’ a three-Judge Bench of this Court invalidated a legislation on the ground that it was arbitrary and in violation of Article 14. However, in State of Andhra Pradesh v. McDowe&l Clo. ,'®° another three-Judge Bench of this Court held that a plenary legislation cannot be struck down on the ground that it is arbitrary or unreasonable. In McDowell (supra), this Court held that a legislation can be invalidated on only two grounds: first, the lack of legislative competence; and second, on the violation of any fundamental rights guaranteed in Part Ill of the Constitution or of any other constitutional provision. 185. This divergence became more apparent when a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Malpe Vishwanath Acharya ५. State of Maharashtra,"®° invalidated certain provisions of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act 1947 relating to the determination and fixation of the standard rent. This Court declared the provisions in question unreasonable, arbitrary, and violative of Article 14. However, the Court 185 [20Supp0l. 15 SC]R 3 90 : (2002) 2 SCC 188 186 [1994] Suppl. 5 SCR 666 : (1995) 1 SCC 519 187 [1919 S6CR ]39 5 : (1996) 2 SCC 226 188 [1939 S6CR ]72 1 : (1996) 3 SCC 709 189 [1997] Suppl. 6 SCR 717 : (1998) 2 SCC 1 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 543 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. did not strike down the provisions on the ground that the extended period of the statute was to come to an end very soon, requiring the government to reconsider the statutory provisions. Similarly, in Mardia Chemicals Ltd. ४. Union of India,'® another three-Judge Bench of this Court invalidated Section 17(2) of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 for being unreasonable and arbitrary.
