D 22.1.3. The Chief Justice or his designate while exercising power under sub-section (6) of Section 11 shall endeavour to give effect to the appointment procedure prescribed in the arbitration clause. 22.1.4. While exercising such power under sub-section (6) E of Section 11, if circumstances exist, giving rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the person nominated, or if other circumstances warrant appointment of an independent arbitrator by ignoring the procedure prescribed, the Chief Justice or his designate may, for F reasons to be recorded ignore the designated arbitrator and appoint someone else. 22.2. In cases governed by the 1996 Act after the Amendment Act has come into force : If the arbitration clause finds foul with the amended provisions, the G appointment of the arbitrator even if apparently in conformity with the arbitration clause in the agreement, would be illegal and thus the court would be within its powers to appoint such arbitrator(s) as may be permissible.” which has been further considered in S.P. Singla H Constructions (P) Ltd. case [S.P. Singla Constructions (P) M/S. SHREE VISHNU CONSTRUCTIONS v. THE ENGINEER IN 349 CHIEF MILITARY ENGINEERING SERVICE [M. R. SHAH, J.] Ltd. v. State of H.P., (2019) 2 SCC 488 : (2019) 1 SCC (Civ) A 748] : (SCC p. 495, para 16) “16. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are not inclined to go into the merits of this contention of the appellant nor examine the correctness or otherwise of the above view taken by the Delhi High Court in Ratna B Infrastructure Projects case [Ratna Infrastructure Projects (P) Ltd. v. Meja Urja Nigam (P) Ltd., 2017 SCC OnLine Del 7808] ; suffice it to note that as per Section 26 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, the provisions of the amended 2015 Act shall not apply to C the arbitral proceedings commenced in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act before the commencement of the Amendment Act unless the parties otherwise agree. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, the proviso in Clause (65) of the general conditions of the contract cannot be taken to be the D agreement between the parties so as to apply the provisions of the amended Act. As per Section 26 of the Act, the provisions of the 2015 Amendment Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of the 2015 Amendment Act (w.e.f. 23- E 10-2015). In the present case, arbitration proceedings commenced way back in 2013, much prior to coming into force of the amended Act and therefore, provisions of the amended Act cannot be invoked.” 27. We are also of the view that the 2015 Amendment Act F which came into force i.e. on 23-10-2015, shall not apply to the arbitral proceedings which have commenced in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act, 1996 before the coming into force of the 2015 Amendment Act, unless the parties otherwise agree.
