When it was the case on behalf of the borrowers that in view of Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act, the properties were agricultural lands, the same were being exempted from the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, the burden B was upon the borrower to prove that the secured properties were agricultural lands and actually being used as agricultural lands and/or agricultural activities were going on. Therefore, the High Court has materially erred in shifting the burden upon the secured creditor to prove that the properties are non-agricultural lands or have been put to non- C agricultural use. 8. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned and passed by the High Court is unsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside. Accordingly, the impugned and dated 06.03.2020 passed by the High Court D for the State of Telangana at Hyderabad in Writ Petition No.12081/2019 is hereby quashed and set aside and the and dated 16.05.2019 passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal-I, Hyderabad dismissing SA No.171/2016 is hereby restored.
