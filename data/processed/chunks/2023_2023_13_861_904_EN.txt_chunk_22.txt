Kraipak v. Union of India [(1969) 2 SCC 262 : AIR 1970 SC 150] . 13. In Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. v. Union of India [(1973) 1 SCC 380 : AIR 1973 SC 389] this Court approvingly referred to the opinion of Lord Denning in R. v. Gaming Board for Great Britain, ex p Benaim [(1970) 2 QB 417 : (1970) 2 WLR 1009 : (1970) 2 All ER 528 (CA)] and quoted him as saying “that heresy was scotched in Ridge v. Baldwin [1964 AC 40 : (1963) 2 WLR 935 : (1963) 2 All ER 66 (HL)] ”. 14. The expression “speaking ” was first coined by Lord Chancellor Earl Cairns in a rather strange context. The Lord Chancellor, while explaining the ambit of the writ of certiorari, referred to s with errors on the face of the record and pointed out that an with errors on its face, is a speaking . (See pp. 1878-97, Vol. 4, Appeal Cases 30 at 40 of the Report). 5 (2010) 9 SCC 496 EVA AGRO FEEDS PRIVATE LIMITED v. PUNJAB NATIONAL 891 BANK AND ANR. [UJJAL BHUYAN, J.] 15. This Court always opined that the face of an passed by a quasi-judicial authority or even an administrative authority aff ecting the rights of parties, must speak. It must not be like the “inscrutable face of a sphinx”. 34. Having discussed the above, we may again advert to the impugned e-mail dated 21.07.2021, as per which Liquidator informed the appellant that in terms of Clause 3(k) of the E-Auction Process Information Document he had cancelled the E-auction held on 20.07.2021. As we have already noted, Clause 3(k) of the E-Auction Process Information Document simply says that the Liquidator has absolute right to accept or reject any or all bids or adjourn/postpone/cancel the E-auction or withdraw any asset/ property or portion thereof from the E-auction at any stage without assigning any reason thereof. While the Liquidator has traced his authority to the aforesaid provision, we may mention that as per Clause 2(m), the information provided in the E-Auction Process Information Document should be read together with the provisions of the Code and the Regulations. In the event of a confl ict between the E-Auction Process Information Document and the Code or the Regulations, the provisions of the Code or the Regulations, as the case may be, shall always prevail. That apart, Clause 3(i) clarifi es that the E-Auction Process Information Document is neither an agreement nor an off er by the Liquidator to the prospective bidders or any other person. The objective of the E-Auction Process Information Document is to provide information to the interested party to enable it to off er its bid. As per Clause 5(n) the bidder with the highest off er/bid does not get any right to demand acceptance of his bid. 34.1. A conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions would make it clear that while the highest bidder has no indefeasible right to demand acceptance of his bid, the Liquidator if he does not want to accept the bid of the highest bidder has to apply his mind to the relevant factors.
