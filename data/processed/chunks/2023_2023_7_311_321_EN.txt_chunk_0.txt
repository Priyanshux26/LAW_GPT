The respondent no.1 had purchased the land in question vide registered sale deed dated 18.06.2003. The fact that he had knowledge about the acquisition of land, is evident from two facts. Firstly, that it was sought to be pointed out by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the B respondent no. 1 that he had obtained permission from the competent authority in terms of the provisions of the 1972 Act for transfer of the land, which had already been acquired. Though, in para 13 of the sale deed a vague averment has been made in that regard, however, no such certificate was produced. Even C production thereof may not be of any help to the respondent no.
