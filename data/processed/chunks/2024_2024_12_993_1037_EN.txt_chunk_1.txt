[Paras 56, 57(b), 57(d)] Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act, 1959 – s.52(1) – Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – The validity of the notification u/s.52(1) for the acquisition of the Nangli Kota lands: Held: It is an admitted fact by both the parties that there were no individual notices served upon the owners as required u/s.52(2) nor was the notice of the proposed acquisition pasted on some conspicuous space in the locality where the property was situated – The State Government had only published the notice u/s.52(2) in the official gazette – A reading of s.52(2) shows that the conditions of publication of notice in the official gazette and pasting the same at a conspicuous area of the locality are [2024] 12 S.C.R. 995 Urban Improvement Trust v. Smt. Vidhya Devi and Ors. together considered to be sufficient notice and fulfilment of just one requirement out of the two risked causing prejudice to the respondents herein – What remains to be seen is whether the improper service of notice did in fact deprive the respondents from making their representations and objections to the acquisition proceedings – The documents placed on record show that the seven sons of late ‘RN’ participated in the proceedings before the OSD and were aware that the Nangli Kota lands were proposed to be acquired – Therefore, the participation in the proceedings by the landowners themselves is sufficient evidence that the object of the publication of the notice u/s.52(2) was met – The acquiring authority that is, the State was not required to prove actual notice of the proposal to acquire in this case and the knowledge of the appellants about the acquisition proceedings is equivalent to implied notice to the appellants – Therefore, the non-service of individual notices upon the owners u/s.52(2) cannot be a ground to invalidate the acquisition proceedings.
