The only exception is the solitary of the Division Bench of Calcutta High Court in Ashok Kumar Gupta (supra), which was distinguished by the learned Single Judge of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Kalpana Yogesh Dhagat (supra) and rightly so, in our opinion, we have no hesitation in holding that the view taken in the s of Kalpana Yogesh Dhagat (supra) (by the High Court of Gujarat); Asulal Loya (supra) (by the High Court of Delhi) and Tarun Kumar Banerjee (supra) (by the High Court of Bombay) is the correct exposition on this legal issue and we grant full imprimatur to the said proposition of law. 30. We would like to answer the three questions of law enumerated above as follows. 31. In to be declared as “State” or “other authority” within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India, it would have to fall within the well-recognised parameters laid down in a number of s of this Court. In this regard, we may refer to the case of Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology21 wherein this Court after taking into consideration the previous s on this point, observed as follows: “27.Ramana [(1979) 3 SCC 489 : AIR 1979 SC 1628] was noted and quoted with approval in extenso and the tests propounded for determining as to when a corporation can be said to be an instrumentality or agency of the Government therein were culled out and summarised as follows : (SCC p. 737, para 9) 21 [2002] 3 SCR 100 : (2002) 5 SCC 111 954 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “(1) One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the corporation is held by Government, it would go a long way towards indicating that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of Government. (SCC p. 507, para 14) (2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so much as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation, it would afford some indication of the corporation being impregnated with governmental character. (SCC p. 508, para 15) (3) It may also be a relevant factor … whether the corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State-conferred or State-protected. (SCC p. 508, para 15) (4) Existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford an indication that the corporation is a State agency or instrumentality. (SCC p. 508, para 15) (5) If the functions of the corporation are of public importance and closely related to governmental functions, it would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation as an instrumentality or agency of Government. (SCC p. 509, para 16) (6) ‘Specifically, if a department of Government is transferred to a corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of this inference’ of the corporation being an instrumentality or agency of Government. (SCC p. 510, para 18)” 40. The picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests formulated in Ajay Hasia [Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi, (1981) 1 SCC 722 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 258] are not a rigid set of principles so that if a body falls within any one of them it must, ex hypothesi, be considered to be a State within the meaning of Article 12.
