Both these writ petitions are accordingly allowed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no as to costs. H 316 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A NAGARATHNA, J. I have perused the and proposed by His Lordship M.R. Shah J. as well as the conclusions reached by him. However, I would like to render my separate opinion on the issues raised in these writ petitions revolving around the definition of “Sikkimese” appended as an Explanation to Section 10 (26AAA) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 B (hereinafter referred to as ‘I.T. Act, 1961’) as well as on the vires of the proviso concerning Sikkimese women assailed in these writ petitions. 2. His Lordship M.R. Shah, J. has opined as follows: (i) That Section 10 (26AAA) to the extent that it excludes old Indian settlers from the benefit of exemption from payment of C income tax i.e. those who have settled in Sikkim prior to merger of Sikkim with India on 26th April, 1975 but whose names are not recorded as “Sikkim Subjects” from the definition of Sikkimese is ultra vires as, being arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Hence, D petitioners herein and similarly situated persons who are old Indian settlers who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26th April, 1975 shall also be entitled to the exemption under Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961. In my view, persons such as the petitioners and similarly E situated persons are not entitled to the exemption under the Explanation as it now stands. In the circumstances, in to remove the discrimination, certain observations have been made and directions have been issued by me to the Union of India on the basis of reasons assigned during the course of my . If those directions are complied with, the F discrimination would be removed. (ii) I agree with the conclusion reached by M.R. Shah, J. to the effect that the proviso in Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 is arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India. I have assigned additional G reasons and dealt with the said aspect of the matter in greater detail through the course of my and . Background facts: 3. Writ Petition (C) No.1283 of 2021 has been filed by the petitioners under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, assailing the H validity of the proviso to Section 10 (26AAA) and Explanation thereto ASSOCIATION OF OLD SETTLERS OF SIKKIM AND ORS. v. 317 UNION OF INDIA AND ANR.
