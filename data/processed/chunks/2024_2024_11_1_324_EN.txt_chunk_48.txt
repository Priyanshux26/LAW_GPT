Therefore, the moment the 1952 Act was 45 [1952] 1 SCR 683 : 1952 (2) SCC 1 : 1952 INSC 63 66 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports passed and Section 2 came into operation, the Act of 1950 meant the 1950 Act as amended by Section 2, that is to say, the 1950 Act now due to expire on 1-10-1952.” The decision in Shamarao Parulekar outlines the “Pen and Ink” theory advocated by the appellants. When an amending statute effectuates a substitution, it modifies the original statutory text by omitting certain words and inserting certain other words. After the amending Act, the statute must be read to exclude the omitted words and to include the inserted words. The appellants rely on Shamarao Parulekar to highlight that a court cannot give effect to the omitted words after they have been removed by the amending Act. This rule is subject to certain well-recognised exceptions (such as in respect of rights which have been created under the original statutory text and limitations on the retrospective operation of laws). The exceptions are not of concern to us presently. However, the appellants argue that Shamarao Parulekar represents an authority for the proposition that after the Forty-Second Amendment, the words “the principles specified in clause (b) or clause (c) of article 39” can no longer be enforced as they were omitted by a constitutional amendment. However, the decision in Shamarao Parulekar is not strictly applicable to the present situation as it did not deal with the legal effect of the amending act itself being declared void. While the decision undoubtedly lays down the correct position of law where a valid amendment is enacted, it offers no insight into whether a court can give effect to the words omitted by an amendment if the amendment is declared unconstitutional. In such cases, do the omitted words revive? This question is not answered by Justice Bose in Shamarao Parulekar for the amendment to the Preventive Detention Act was not invalidated. 53. The Appellants next placed significant emphasis on the decision in ATB Mehtab Majid v State of Madras.46 The case concerned a challenge to Rule 16 of the Madras General Sales Tax (Turnover and Assessment) Rules, 1939. Rule 16 had been amended to include a proviso which resulted in the differential taxation of tanned hides based on whether they had been tanned within the state of Madras or outside the state. When the issue reached this Court, it 46 [1963] Supp. 2 SCR 435 : (1963) 14 STC 355 : 1962 INSC 342 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 67 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. was observed that under the amended Rule 16, a dealer who both purchased the untanned hides and tanned them within the State, was only required to pay the duty on the purchase price but a dealer who purchased the untanned hides from outside the state and tanned them within the state, would be liable to pay sales tax on the sale price of the tanned hides, which was substantially higher.47 Speaking for a Constitution Bench of this Court, Justice Raghubar Dayal, struck down the amended Rule 16 as violative of Article 304(a) of the Constitution on the following terms: “We are therefore of the opinion that the provisions of rule 16(2) discriminate against imported hides or skins which had been purchased or tanned outside the State and that therefore they contravene the provisions of Article 304(a) of the Constitution.
