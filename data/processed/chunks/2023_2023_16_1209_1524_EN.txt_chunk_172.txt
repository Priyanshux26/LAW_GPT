28. A person’s autonomy to choose a spouse or life partner, has been declared as integral to one’s fundamental right to live: in Asha Ranjan v. State of Bihar20, this choice of a “partner in life” was held to be “a legitimate constitutional right” that is “founded on individual choice” and the court decried the concept of “class honour” or “group thinking” which acted as barriers from the exercise of free choice. Similarly, In re [Gang-Rape 17 2009 (13) SCR 989. This court held that “a woman’s right to make reproductive choices” is “a dimension of ‘personal liberty’ as understood under Article 21”. 18 2016 (5) SCR 773 19 2022 (7) SCR 686 20 2017 (1) SCR 945 SUPRIYO @ SUPRIYA CHAKRABORTY & ANR. v. 1447 UNION OF INDIA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] ed by Village Kangaroo Court in W.B.,21 echoed the same idea and said that the state is “duty-bound” to protect the fundamental rights “and an inherent aspect of Article 21 of the Constitution would be the freedom of choice in marriage.” Shafi n Jahan v.

Hotel Association of India25 where gender and age barriers were held unconstitutional; the choice of an individual patient has been held to exercising his (or her) legal right to euthanasia (or to his relations in certain circumstances, particularly when the patient is unconscious or incapacitated to take a decision), in Common Cause (A Regd. Society) v. Union of India (UOI) & Ors (hereafter, “Common Cause”)26.
