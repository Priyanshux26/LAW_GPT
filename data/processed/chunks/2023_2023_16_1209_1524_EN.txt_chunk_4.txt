regime – The State has an obligation to recognize such unions and grant them benefi t under law – In Art.15(1), the word ‘sex’ must be read to include ‘sexual orientation’ not only because of the causal relationship between homophobia and sexism but also because the word ‘sex’ is used as a marker of identity which cannot be read independent of the social and historical context – The right to enter into a union cannot be restricted based on sexual orientation – Such a restriction will be violative of Art.15 – Thus, this freedom is available to all persons regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation – The decisions in Navtej and Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) recognize the right of queer couples to exercise the choice to enter into a union – This relationship is protected from external threat – Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation will violate Art.15 – The right to enter into a union is also grounded in Article 19(1)(e) – Union Government, State Governments, and Governments of Union Territories not to discriminate against the freedom of queer persons to enter into union with benefi ts under law – Assurance of the Solicitor General that the Union Government will constitute a Committee chaired by the Cabinet Secretary for the purpose of defi ning and elucidating the scope of the entitlements of queer couples who are in unions – The Committee shall inter alia consider the following: (i) enabling partners in a queer relationship (a) to be treated as a part of the same family for the purposes of a ration card; and (b) to have the facility of a joint bank account with the option to name the partner as a nominee, in case of death; and (ii) legal consequences such as succession rights, maintenance, fi nancial benefi ts such as under the Income Tax Act 1961, rights fl owing from employment such as gratuity and family pension and insurance – The report of the Committee be implemented at the administrative level by the Union Government and the governments of the States and Union Territories. [Paras 226, 340] – Held (per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.) (Dissenting): Non-heterosexual unions are entitled to protection under our Constitutional schema – Non-heterosexual unions and heterosexual unions/marriages ought to be considered as two sides of the same coin, both in terms of recognition and consequential benefi ts – This moment presents an opportunity of reckoning with this historical injustice and casts a collective duty upon all constitutional institutions to take affi rmative steps to remedy the discrimination – Legal recognition of non-heterosexual unions represents a step forward towards marriage equality – At the same time, marriage is not an end in itself – Our Constitution contemplates a holistic understanding of equality, which applies to all spheres of life – The practice of equality necessitates acceptance and protection of individual choices – The capacity of non-heterosexual couples for love, commitment and responsibility is no less SUPRIYO @ SUPRIYA CHAKRABORTY & ANR. v. 1215 UNION OF INDIA worthy of regard than heterosexual couples – Let this autonomy be preserved, so long as it does not infringe on the rights of others.
