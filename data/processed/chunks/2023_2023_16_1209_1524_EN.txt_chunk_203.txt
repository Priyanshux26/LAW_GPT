If this be the true view, and we think it is, in determining the impact of State action upon constitutional guarantees which are fundamental, it follows that the extent of protection against impairment of a fundamental right is determined not by the object of the Legislature nor by the form of the action, but by its direct operation upon the individual’s rights.” This line of reasoning was applied and commended in Maneka Gandhi (supra); it is now an intrinsic part of the constitutional lore. 108 Ghaidan v Godin – Mendoza, (2004) UKHL 30. 109 Minister of Home Aff airs v. Fourie & Anr, [(CCT 60/04) [2005] ZACC 19; 2006 (1) SA 524 (CC)] 110 AK Gopalan v. State of Madras, (1950) 1 SCR 88 SUPRIYO @ SUPRIYA CHAKRABORTY & ANR. v. 1487 UNION OF INDIA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 109. In recent times, this court has applied, in relation to claims of discrimination, the test of indirect discrimination. This dimension was explained in Lt. Col Nitisha v. Union of India111: “First, the doctrine of indirect discrimination is founded on the compelling insight that discrimination can often be a function, not of conscious design or malicious intent, but unconscious/implicit biases or an inability to recognize how existing structures/institutions, and ways of doing things, have the consequence of freezing an unjust status quo. In to achieve substantive equality prescribed under the Constitution, indirect discrimination, even sans discriminatory intent, must be prohibited. In Navtej Johar (supra) too, earlier, the concurring of the present Chief Justice, had relied on the directive of European Parliament which defi nes indirect discriminatory impact as: “where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of one sex at a particular disadvantage compared with persons of the other sex, unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justifi ed by a legitimate aim, and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.” Interestingly, an earlier decision of this court, had relied on the concept and application of indirect discrimination test in Om Kumar and Ors v. Union of India112 - in the context of discussing the principle of proportionality: “If indirect discrimination were established, the Government would have to show ‘very weighty reasons’ by way of objective justifi cation, bearing in mind that derogations from fundamental rights must be construed strictly and in accordance with the principle of proportionality” Later s (S.K. Nausad Rahaman & Ors. v. Union of India (UOI) & Ors113 and Ravinder Kumar Dhariwal v. Union of India114) also 111 2021 (4) SCR 633 112 2000 Supp (4) SCR693 113 2022 (12) SCC 1 114 2021 (13) SCR 823 148 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. applied the indirect discrimination test to judge the validity of the measure in question. 110. The common feature of the “eff ect of the law and of the action upon the right” in R.C. Cooper (supra) and the decisions which applied the indirect discrimination lens, is that the objects (of the legislation or the policy involved) are irrelevant.
