[Para 55] Public functionaries – Public efficiency – Maintenance of balance between accountability and autonomy of action – Test of justness, fairness, reasonableness: Held: Accountability is an impediment to efficient discharge of the duty – There is a distinction between prying into details of day- to-day administration and of the legitimate actions or resultant consequences thereof – To enthuse efficiency into administration, a balance between accountability and autonomy of action should be carefully maintained – Over-emphasis on either would impinge upon public efficiency – But undermining the accountability would give immunity or carte blanche power to deal with the public property or of the debtor at whim or vagary – Whether the public authority acted bona fide would be gauged from the impugned action and attending circumstances – Authority should justify the action assailed on the touchstone of justness, fairness, reasonableness and as a reasonable prudent owner – Test of reasonableness is stricter – Public functionaries should be duty conscious rather than power charged – Its actions and decisions which touch the common man have to be tested on the touchstone of fairness and justice – That which is not fair and just is unreasonable – And what is unreasonable is arbitrary – An arbitrary action is ultra vires – It does not become bona fide and in good faith merely because no 480 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports personal gain or benefit to the person exercising discretion has been established – An action is mala fide if it is contrary to the purpose for which it was authorised to be exercised – Dishonesty in discharge of duty vitiates the action without anything more – An action is bad even without proof of motive of dishonesty, if the authority is found to have acted contrary to reason. [Para 67] Words and phrases – Illegality and irregularity – Distinction between : Held: Once it is evident that the mandatory provisions as stipulated under the rules and regulations are not followed or abridged, any action pursuant to the same could be termed as gross illegality – There is a fine distinction between illegality and irregularity – Whereas the former goes to the root of the matter and renders the action null and void, of no effect whatsoever, the latter does not ipso facto invalidate the action, unless prejudice is caused to the person making a complaint.
