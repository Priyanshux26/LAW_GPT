7. In Popular Construction Co.1, this Court has held that an application for setting aside an award filed beyond the period F mentioned in Section 34(3) would not be an application “in accordance with sub-section (3) as required under Section 34(1) of the 1996 Act” and Section 5 of the 1963 Act has no application to such application. In para 12 of the Report, it was held in Popular Construction Co.1 thus: (SCC pp.474-75) G “12. As far as the language of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is concerned, the crucial words are “but not thereafter” used in the proviso to sub-section (3). In our opinion, this phrase would amount to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, and would therefore bar the H 378 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A application of Section 5 of that Act. Parliament did not need to go further. To hold that the court could entertain an application to set aside the award beyond the extended period under the proviso, would render the phrase “but not thereafter” wholly otiose. No principle of interpretation would justify such a result”. B 8. Recently, in State of Maharashtra v. Hindustan Construction Company Limited2, a two-Judge Bench of this Court speaking through one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.) emphasised the mandatory nature of the limit to the extension of the period provided in proviso to Section 34(3) and held that an application for setting aside arbitral award under Section 34 of the 1996 C Act has to be made within the time prescribed under sub-section (3) of Section 34 i.e., within three months and a further period of 30 days on sufficient cause being shown and not thereafter. 9. Section 43(1) of the 1996 Act provides that the 1963 Act shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in court. D The 1963 Act is thus applicable to the matters of arbitration covered by the 1996 Act save and except to the extent its applicability has been excluded by virtue of the express provision contained in Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act.” Before this Court there existed, similar facts like in the present E case. In the case before this Court, the arbitral awards were received by the appellants on 26.08.2003. No application for setting aside the arbitral award was made before elapse of three months from the receipt thereof. Three months from the date of receipt of the award expired on 26.11.2003. The District Court had Christmas vacation for the period from 25.12.2003 to 01.01.2004. On reopening of the Court i.e. on F 02.01.2004, the appellants made application for setting aside the award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. Considering the aforesaid facts and thereafter considering Sections 2(j) and 4 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963, this Court observed and held and concluded in paragraphs 11 to 15 as under: G “11. The question, therefore, that falls for our determination is - whether the appellants are entitled to extension of time under Section 4 of the 1963 Act in the above facts?
