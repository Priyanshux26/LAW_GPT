3.1 to 3.4 and accused no. 4 to the applicants towards the cost of the present proceedings. 64. After pronouncement of the above , Mr. Mihir Joshi, learned Senior Advocate seeks for stay of operation of this for a period of four weeks. Having regard to the facts of above case, we are of the considered view that it would be just and necessary to stay this for a period of four weeks from today. Accordingly, we grant stay of this for a period of four weeks from today subject to accused Nos. 3.1 to 3.4 and accused No. 4 depositing of fi ne amount and costs as ed hereinabove before this Court within two weeks from today.” 6.. It all started with an passed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court dated 14.10.2015 in the Civil Appeal No. 11412 of 2015 in the Special Civil Application No. 16266 of 2013 referred to above. The dated 14.10.2015 referred to above reads thus: “It is stated at the Bar by Mr. Sanjanwala learned senior advocate, on instructions from his clients, that the property qua the subject matter of this entry and the petition, shall not be sold out till the main petition is heard and decided, which satisfi es the conscious of Mr. Mihir Thakor learned senior advocate appearing with Mr. Prabhav Mehta learned advocate and he states that he may not press the Letters Patent Appeal, on instructions. Hence, this Civil Application stands disposed of accordingly. It goes without saying that the was passed adinvitum/by consent of the learned advocates.” (Emphasis supplied) 1074 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 7. Thus, it appears that a statement was made by the learned counsel appearing for the contemnors before the High Court in the form of an undertaking and that too upon instructions of the clients that the subject matter i.e., the property would not be sold till the main petition i.e., the Special Civil Application No. 16266 of 2013 is fi nally disposed of. 8. On the strength of the aforesaid one Letters Patent Appeal (LPA) fi led by the respondents herein against an interim also came to be disposed of vide dated 21.10.2015, which reads thus: “Mr. Prabhav Mehta learned advocate for the applicants states that in view of the dated 14 October, 2015 passed by learned single Judge in Civil Application No. 11412 of 2015 in SCA No. 16266 of 2013, wherein the statement is recorded that the property in question qua the subject matter of this entry shall not be sold until the main petition is heard and decided, he seeks permission to withdraw the proceedings. Permission is granted. Accordingly, the Civil Application No. 10627 of 2015 and LPA(Stamp) No. 1195 of 2015 in SCA No. 16266 of 2013 with the Civil Application (Stamp) No. 10539 of 2015 shall stand disposed of as withdrawn.” (Emphasis supplied) 9. It appears that despite having undertaken that the property qua the subject matter of the disputed entry would not be disposed of till the fi nal disposal of the main matter; the appellants herein proceeded to execute as many as 13 sale deeds in favour of diff erent parties and thereby, wilfully disobeyed the dated 14.10.2015 passed by the High Court referred to above.
