No dispute has been raised regarding partition of the property by the Trial Court by any of the co-sharers. It is not a matter of dispute that in terms of law laid down by this Court in Resident’s Welfare Association and Another vs Union Territory of Chandigarh and Others11 interpreting the 1960 Rules, there cannot be partition of property by metes and bounds at Chandigarh. Hence, the only solution was for sale of property by way of auction. This was the decree passed by the Trial Court, which was not challenged by any of the co-sharers on this issue. 15. It has now come on record that defendant No.3(a), who purchased 1% share from the defendant No.3, is in possession of half portion of the ground floor which according to him has not been let out.
