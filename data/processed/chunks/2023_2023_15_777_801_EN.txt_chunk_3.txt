Correspondence was exchanged between the Chief Minister and the Governor. On 15 July 2023, the Chief Minister addressed a communication to the Governor noting that though the Sikh Gurudwaras (Amendment) Bill 2023 was submitted for assent on 26 June 2023, it had not been assented to till then. In his response dated 17 July 2023, the Governor stated that: “I have proceeded to receive legal advice which gives me to believe that your calling of Vidhan Sabha session on 19-6-2023 and 20-6-2023 when these four Bills were passed was in breach of law and procedure” The Governor thereby cast doubt on the legitimacy and legality of those Bills. The Governor stated that “in the background of the legal advice received” he was actively considering whether to obtain the legal opinion of the Attorney General for India “or as per the Constitution, to reserve these Bills for the consideration and consent of the President of India”.
