Hence they cannot succeed.” (emphasis added) 15. We also take note of the submission made by Mr. Kaleeswaram Raj, learned counsel for the respondents-writ petitioners that the power of judicial review cannot be excluded as that is a remedy which was always available to the respondents-writ petitioners dehors the equally alternative efficacious remedy available under the ID Act. It is no doubt true that powers of judicial review can always be exercised by a writ Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India but wherever there are disputed questions of facts that need adjudication, it is best left to the competent forum to adjudicate the same by examining the evidence brought on record before any findings can be returned. 16. There are a line of decisions of this Court relating to entertaining writ petitions when an alternative remedy is available. Constitution Benches of this Court have held that Article 226 of the Constitution of India confers a vide power on the High Courts in matters relating to issuance of writs (Refer: K.S. Rashid and Son v. Income Tax Investigation Commission and Another 7, Sangram Singh v. Election Tribunal 8, Union of India v. T.R. Varma9, State of U.P. v. Mohd. Nooh10 and K.S.Venkatraman and Co. (P) Ltd. V. State of Madras11). 17. At the same time the remedy of writ is a discretionary remedy and the High Court has always the discretion to refuse to grant any writ if it is satisfied that the aggrieved party can have an adequate or suitable remedy elsewhere (Refer: U.P State Spinning Co. Ltd. V. R.S. Pandey & Another12). This discretion is more a rule of self- imposed restrain than a statutory embargo. In essence, it can be described as a rule of convenience and discretion. Conversely, even 7 (1954) SCR 738 : AIR 1954 SC 207 8 (1955) 2 SCR 1 : AIR 1955 SC 425 9 (1958) SCR 499 : AIR 1957 SC 882 10 (1958) SCR 595 : AIR 1958 SC 86 11 (1966) 2 SCR 229 : AIR 1966 SC 1089 12 [2005] Supp. 3 SCR 603 : (2005) 8 SCC 264 1246 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports if there exists an alternative remedy, it is well within the jurisdiction and the discretion of the High Court to grant relief under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, in some contingencies, as for example, where the writ petition has been filed for enforcement of any of the fundamental rights or where there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice or where the s or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or further, where the vires of the Act is under challenge (Refer: Harbanslal Sahnia v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. and Others13). The limitation imposed on itself by the High Court is more a rule of good sense. 18. If a party approaches the High court without availing of the alternative remedy provided under the statute, the High court ought not to interfere except in circumstances where the party makes out a strong case that there exist convincing grounds to invoke its extraordinary jurisdiction.
