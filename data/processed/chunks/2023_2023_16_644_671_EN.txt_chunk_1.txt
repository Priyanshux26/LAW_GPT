[Paras 30, 32, 55] Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 – ss.16, 11 – Presumption u/s.16 in favour of a registered document relating to adoption, rebuttable – Appellant claimed a half-share in V’s properties relying on the adoption ceremony and the registered Adoption Deed: Held: The presumption is rebuttable – On facts, the adoption ceremony and the Adoption Deed are shrouded with equally suspicious circumstances – As the Adoption Deed was registered, the presumption u/s.16 attached to it and it was for ‘GK’ (V’s grandson) to rebut that presumption, who did so more than suffi ciently – Mere registration of the Adoption Deed did not absolve the person asserting such adoption from proving that fact by cogent evidence and the person contesting it from adducing evidence to the contrary – It is in this respect that various suspicious circumstances attached to the adoption ceremony of assume signifi cance – The actual ‘giving and taking’ of the child in adoption, is an essential requisite u/s.11(vi) however, there is no convincing evidence of that ‘act’ also in the case on hand – There are no pictures of the actual ‘giving and taking’ of the child in adoption.
