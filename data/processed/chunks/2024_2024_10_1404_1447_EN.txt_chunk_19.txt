The next issue is whether AERA is undertaking an adjudicatory function in determining tariff under Section 13(1)(a) of the AERA Act. We have already in the preceding section clarified that the test to be adopted is whether the authority was undertaking an adjudicatory exercise. However, before we proceed with this analysis, we deem it necessary to deal with the concept of ‘quasi-judicial’ functions since s of larger Benches have approached the issue of whether an authority can contest an appeal against its based on whether it was issued in exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. 35. The respondents placed reliance on certain observations of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Express Newspaper Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India60on the tests to be adopted to determine whether an administrative body is exercising a quasi-judicial function. One of the issues before this Court in that case was whether the functions performed by the Wage Board constituted under the Working Journalists (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1955 are administrative, judicial, quasi-judicial or legislative in character. This Court had to determine this question to decide if the decisions of the Wage Board were open to judicial view and whether the principle of audi alteram partem applied to the proceedings before the Wage Boards.61 The Constitution Bench laid down the following test to determine if an administrative body is exercising a quasi-judicial function: “112. In , therefore, to determine whether an administrative body is exercising a quasi-judicial function, it would be necessary to examine in the first instance, whether it has to decide on evidence between a proposal and an opposition and secondly, whether it under a duty to act judicially in the matter of arriving at its decision.” 36. In the subsequent section, we will refer to the meaning of the phase “quasi-judicial” and its legal underpinnings. We will explain how the 60 1959 SCR 12 61 1959 SCR 12 [93] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1431 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. test of the duty to act ‘judicially’ was a standard that was evolved to ensure the compliance of the principles of natural justice and how it is no more relevant in view of the constitutionalising of the principles of natural justice. 37. In the 1950s, a functional distinction was drawn between executive and judicial62 actions and between an action that deprives rights and an action that deprives privileges63 for deciding the applicability of the principles of natural justice.64 It was presumed that only a judicial body must act ‘judicially’ by following the principles of natural justice.
