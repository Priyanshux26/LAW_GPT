Digital Supreme Court Reports 4. Vide the Impugned s, the High Court refused to quash the Docket dated 20.07.2021 which reinitiated criminal proceedings against the Appellants for offences u/s. 420, 498A, 506 of the IPC & u/s. 3, 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. Brief Facts 5. The Appellants before us are the husband and the in-laws of Respondent No. 2 i.e., the de-facto complainant. After the case against the Appellants for the aforementioned offences was instituted, the parties were referred to the Lok Adalat by the Trial Court. 6. As per the Docket dated 26.06.2021, the parties entered into a compromise before the Lok Adalat and in consideration of the same, a petition for compounding of the offences was allowed by the Trial Court. Accordingly, the Appellants were acquitted by the Trial Court. 7. Thereafter, Respondent No. 2 altered her position and filed a memo before the Trial Court withdrawing her consent from the compromise. Consequently, vide Docket dated 20.07.2021, the Trial Court reopened the proceedings against the Appellants. 8.

However, in recognition of the fact that the allegations were general and omnibus in nature, the High Court dispensed with the presence of the Appellants during the trial and furthermore, left it open for the Trial Court to conduct trial. 1 Andhra Pradesh Act 11 of 2003, sec. 2 (w.e.f. 01.08.2003) [2024] 2 S.C.R. 255 Mamidi Anil Kumar Reddy v. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr. Submissions & Analysis: 11. Learned Counsel for the Appellants vehemently submits that a bare perusal of the complaint filed by Respondent No.2 and the charge- sheet plainly discloses the absence of any necessary ingredients of the charged offences.
