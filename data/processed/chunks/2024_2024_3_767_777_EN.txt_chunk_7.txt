17. We are of the considered view that the High Court has failed to draw a distinction between the “may have committed the crime” or “must have committed the crime”, as held by this Court in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda (supra). As held by this Court, the suspicion, however strong it may be, cannot take the place of proof beyond reasonable doubt. We, therefore, find that the prosecution has failed to prove any incrimination circumstance beyond reasonable doubt and in any case failed to establish a chain of events intertwined with each other, which leads to no other conclusion than the guilt of the accused. 18. Considering the facts and circumstances, the appeal is partly allowed and the conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellant herein for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC is set aside. However, the conviction and sentence in respect of the offences punishable under Sections 304B, 498A read with Section 34 IPC are restored. 19. In the present case, the appellant has undergone incarceration for a period of more than fifteen years. In that view of the matter, we direct that it will not be necessary for the appellant to deposit the fine amount. The appellant is directed to be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case. 20. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
