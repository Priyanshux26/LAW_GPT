To recall, the petitioners argued that prior to the commencement of the Constitution, the law did not confer the power to establish a university on a person. It was argued that the power only vested in the Imperial Legislature and thus, no person could have “established” a university. 76 See Keshavan Madhava Menon v. State of Bombay, AIR 1951 SC 128 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1727 Aligarh Muslim University v. Naresh Agarwal & Ors. 88. The educational policy in pre-independent India must be referred to provide a brief context on the distinction between universities and colleges. One of the distinctions between a college and a university is the ability of the latter to confer degrees to students as evidence of their proficiency in subjects which they have studied and for which they are assessed. On 19 July 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company submitted a despatch77 to the Governor-General of India in Council on the subject of General Education in India. The despatch recommended the incorporation of Universities by Acts of the Legislative Council of India. The first University established in India was the University of Calcutta. It was established by Act No. II of 1857, passed by the Legislative Council of India. The preamble to the enactment provides that the University at Calcutta was to be established for the purpose of awarding academic degrees to persons who have acquired proficiency in subjects. Subsequently, the Legislative Council of India enacted Act No. XXII of 1857 to establish and incorporate the University at Bombay for the same purpose. In 1857, the University at Madras was established.78 In 1860, an Act was passed to give the Universities of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay, the power of conferring degrees in addition to those degrees provided for in the earlier enactments. The Legislative Council of India passed sixteen other enactments79 for the establishment of universities before the commencement of the Constitution. 89. The University Grants Commission Act 195680 was enacted a few years after the commencement of the Constitution. The UGC Act provides the power to confer degrees even to institutions which are not established by an enactment. Section 2(f) defines a University as educational institutions established or incorporated by or under a Central Act, a Provincial Act or a State Act, and includes any such institution as may, in consultation with the University concerned, be 77 “Woods Despatch” 78 Act No. XXVII of 1987 79 The Punjab University Act 1992, the Allahabad University Act 1887, The Mysore University Regulation 1916, The Patna University Act 1917, The Firman of Osmania University 1918, The Lucknow University Act 1920, The Delhi University Act 1922, The Nagpur University Act 1923, The Agra University Act 1926, The Annamalai University Act 1926, University of Tranvancore Promulgation Act 1937, The Utkal University Act 1943, The Gauhati University Act 1947, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda Act 1949, The Gujarat University Act 1949; The Visva-Bharati Act 1951; The Jadavpur University Act 1955. 80 “UGC Act” 1728 [2024] 11 S.C.R.
