CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Criminal Appeal D No.1578 of 2023. From the and dated 20.01.2023 of the High Court of Orissa at Cuttack in BLAPL No.6803 of 2022. Hitendra Nath Rath, Dr. J. Prasangi, R. Sreeramulu, Rajiv Kapoor, E Vikas Sinha, Advs. for the Appellant. Ms. Samapika Biswal, Adv. for the Respondent. The following of the Court was delivered : JUDGEMENT F 1. Leave granted. 2. The impugned is one by which the application for bail filed by the appellant has been rejected. 3. The appellant has been charged for alleged commission of offences under Section 20(b)(ii)(C) of the Narcotic Drugs and G Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The appellant has been in custody for two years and 11 months. The impugned is the passed in the second bail application. The earlier bail application came to be rejected on 07.07.2022. It is, in fact, pointed out by the learned counsel for the State that another attempt at securing bail from the High Court has failed. H 563 564 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 4. As far as the impugned goes, we notice that the following is the reasoning: “Taking into account that the co-accused, who has since been released on bail has not surrendered, this Court is constrained not to entertain the bail application of the petitioner.” B 5. Thereafter the Court proceeded to note the case of the appellant that his father has undergone surgery and the Court proceeded to direct expeditious disposal of the case. 6. We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and also the learned counsel for the State as noted. C 7. The impugned shows that what has weighed with the Court is the fact that the co-accused who was released on bail has not surrendered. It is this factor alone which we can discern to be the reason to not entertain the bail application. 8. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are of the D view that the fact that the co-accused who was released on bail has not surrendered cannot be a germane factor to decline bail to the co-accused, namely, the appellant. 9. In such circumstances, we are of the view that the matter must have reconsideration again at the hands of the High Court. The appeal is E allowed. The impugned is set aside. The High Court will take up BLAPL No.
