Khata Nos.99 and 100 were recorded in the name of Sami Ullah and Badlu. Zahoor Ahmed filed objection under Section 9 of the 1953 Act contending that in Khata No.99 his name should be recorded. He claimed 1/2 share in Khata Nos.98 and 99 contending that Satai was the common ancestor of both the parties and that he had acquired the disputed land from the joint family. According to him, Allah Bux and Mohammad were the sons of Satai. Abdul Ghafoor was the elder son of Allah Bux and became the ‘karta’ of the joint family. After the death of Allah Bux, Abdul Ghafoor, Abdul Shakoor and Mohd. Ismail, being sons of Allah Bux, came into possession of the disputed land jointly. Mohd. Ismail died issueless. The disputed land was recorded in the name of Sami Ullah and Badlu being the sons of Abdul Ghafoor as ‘karta’ of joint family. 12.2. Zahoor stated that at the time of death of his father, he was a minor and lived with Abdul Ghafoor. Abdul Ghafoor and Abdul Shakoor had 1/2 share in the disputed land. Accordingly, both the parties were in possession of the disputed land. 12.3. Sami Ullah and Badlu objected to the claim of Zahoor and contended that the land in Khata No.99 was acquired by Abdul Ghafoor. Sami Ullah and Badlu admitted 1/12 share in the disputed land and denied share of Zahoor in plot No.115 of Khata No.100. 12.4. The primary authority i.e. the Consolidation Officer on the basis of the materials of record and the evidence adduced decided the share of Zahoor in Khata Nos. 98 and 99 at 1/2 and dismissed the objection of Zahoor qua plot No. 115 of Khata No. 100. Therefore, Zahoor filed Appeal No. 43 in respect of plot No. 115 of Khata No.100. Sami Ullah and Badlu filed Appeal Nos. 50 and 51 against the decision of the Consolidation Officer [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1863 Nisar Ahmad & Ors. v. Sami Ullah (Dead) Through Lrs. & Anr. declaring 1/2 share in the disputed land of Khata Nos. 98 and 99 as belonging to Zahoor. 12.5. The appellate authority was of the view that plot No.35 was recorded only in the name of Allah Bux. Zahoor had relinquished in favour of Sami Ullah on 30.06.1948. Zahoor also relinquished the share of Ismail. Sami Ullah had filed the patta for the first time before the Consolidation Officer on 07.05.1992. In the settlement exercise, some disputed land was acquired by Allah Bux and Mohammed jointly. Plot Nos.111 and 112 were recorded in the name of Abdul Ghafoor. The appellate authority noted the submission made on behalf of Zahoor that he was in possession of the disputed land in Khata Nos.98 and 99 and paying land revenue and took the view that the disputed land was in possession of the joint family. When Shakoor, father of Zahoor, had died Zahoor was a minor. Thereafter, father of Sami Ullah brought up Ghafoor and Ghafoor lived as a member of the joint family.
