The “Minutes of ” provides for issuing a direction to the survey authorities to carry out the demarcation of the boundary and a direction to the police to provide protection for carrying out the measurement and construction of the compound wall. Clause (iii) of paragraph 6 of the “Minutes of ” reads thus: “6......................................................................................... (i) ............................................................................. (ii) ............................................................................. (iii) The Construction of the boundary wall as per the dated 12th February 2021 by the Learned Single Judge in the Arbitration Petition no. 451 of 2018, shall be carried out by the Petitioners simultaneously with the aforesaid work of demarcation and marking of points. The Petitioners shall ensure that sufficient 164 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports access is provided for the other owners of land whose property falls within the confines of the boundary wall in such a manner that the dame do not become land locked by virtue of the construction of the boundary wall.” (emphasis added) Thus, the fact that the third parties would be affected by the construction of the compound wall is noted in the “Minutes of ”. The Writ Petition was disposed of on 16th March 2022 by a cryptic directing that the Writ Petition stands disposed of in terms of the “Minutes of ” taken on record and marked “X” for identification. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the said read thus: “2. The Minutes of the are signed by the learned Advocate appearing for the Petitioners, the Learned AGP appearing for Respondent Nos. 1 to 6 and 10 to 12 along with the Advocate General as well as the learned Advocate appearing for the Interveners / farmers – Shankar Kharpade, Raghu Kharpade, Ganu Kharpade, Sadu Kharpade, Sonu Paadvi, Pradeep Savji Urade, Ajay Kharpade, Suresh Kharvade and Sarita Kharvade carrying farming activities on land bearing Survey No. 390 (part). 3. The above Writ Petition is disposed of in terms of the Minutes of the dated 16th March, 2022.” Reasons were not recorded for passing an in terms of the ‘Minutes of ’. A Government counsel signed the “Minutes of ” notwithstanding a clear stand taken in the affidavits dated 14th March 2022 filed by the senior Government officers who had emphasized that tribals were likely to be affected by the construction of the compound wall. The Government pleader, as an officer of the Court, owed a duty to the Court to point out the requirement of impleading necessary parties who were tribals. Even the bench did not take note of the admitted fact that third parties would have been affected by the construction of the compound wall that was permitted to be constructed under police protection. The Court ignored the fundamental principle that the issue of whether the third parties’ properties would be landlocked due to the construction of the wall could be decided only after hearing the concerned parties. The [2024] 5 S.C.R. 165 Ajay Ishwar Ghute & Ors. v. Meher K. Patel & Ors. least the Court could have done was to direct that a notice of survey should be issued to the affected tribals.
