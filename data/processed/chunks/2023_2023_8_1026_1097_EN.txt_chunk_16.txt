(xv) Thereafter, the person alleged to be the PA to the Minister, namely, Shanmugam, who was arrayed as Accused No.3 in CC No.25 of 2021 arising out of FIR No.344 of 2018 lodged by Arulmani, filed a G petition in Crl.O.P No.13374 of 2021 on the file of the High Court seeking to quash CC No.25 of 2021. He claimed in the said petition that a compromise had been reached between the victims (Arulmani and others and the accused) and that, therefore, the complaint may be quashed. Following suit, R. Sahayarajan who was Accused No.3 in CC No.19 of 2020 also filed a quash petition in Crl.O.P No.13914 of 2021, enclosing a H Y. BALAJI v. KARTHIK DESARI & ANR. ETC. 1047 [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] joint compromise memo seeking to quash CC No.19 of 2020. Similarly, A one Vetrichelvan (Accused No.10) filed Crl. O.P No.6621 of 2021 for quashing the proceedings in CC No.24 of 2021. (xvi) By an dated 30.07.2021, the High Court quashed CC No.25 of 2021 on the basis of the Joint Compromise Memo. This was passed completely overlooking the nature of the allegations, the B offences for which the accused ought to have been charged as well as the previous s passed by the High Court itself. (xvii) Just a day before the High Court passed s quashing CC No.25 of 2021, the ED registered an Information Report on 29.07.2021 in ECIR/MDSZO/21/2021 and issued summons to the Minister C Senthil Balaji. (xviii) At this stage, Devasagayam who filed the first complaint in FIR No.441 of 2015 and in whose case a Final Report was filed in CC No.3627 of 2017, filed a very strange petition on the file of the High Court in Crl.O.P. No.15122 of 2021 seeking de novo investigation in D CC No.24 of 2021. It must be recalled at this stage that Devasagayam’s complaint was registered as FIR No.441 of 2015 dated 29.10.2015 and a Final Report was filed therein on 13.06.2017 leading to Calendar Case No.3627 of 2017. But by the s of the High Court, the complaint of Gopi and others got clubbed with the investigation in Devasagayam’s case leading to the registration of a separate Calendar Case in CC No.24 E of 2021. The clubbing actually happened after an allegation was made before the High Court by Gopi, (petitioner in Crl. O.P No.7503 of 2016) to the effect that Devasagayam had been won over. While ing the complaint of Gopi to be clubbed with the investigation in FIR No.441 of 2015, the High Court did not perhaps realize that it may enable F Devasagayam to derail (incidentally he had retired from Railways and the word “derail” suits him) even the proceedings in CC No.24 of 2021. (xix) Finding that the offences under the PC Act were included only in one of the cases and not in others and that it had enabled the G High Court even to quash one of the four calendar cases on the basis of a Joint Compromise Memo, candidates who were unsuccessful in the recruitment and who had filed writ petitions in the High Court challenging the process of selection, filed impleadment petitions, both in the quash petitions in other cases as well as in the petition filed by Devasagayam for de novo investigation.
