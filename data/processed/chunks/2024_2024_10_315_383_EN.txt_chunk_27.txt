31.5 In Priya Indoria v. State of Karnataka,41 the position of law was stated as under: “84. Maxwell in his treatise on Interpretation of Statutes (10 Edn. ), p. 284 states that “the tendency of modern decisions on the whole is to narrow materially the difference between strict and beneficial construction”. It follows that criminal statutes such as the CrPC are interpreted with rational regard to the aim and intention of the legislature. What has to be borne in the judicial mind is that the interpretation of all statutes should be favourable to personal liberty 40 [2011] 1 SCR 997 : (2011) 11 SCC 578 41 [2023] 15 SCR 525 : (2024) 4 SCC 749 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 357 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. subject to fair and effective administration of criminal justice.” (Emphasis supplied) 32. Rules flowing from statutory power, have the effect of a statute. Section 52 of the UAPA grants power to the Central Government to make Rules for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act. Specifically, Section 52 (2)(ee) deals with the present situation, i.e., enables the Government to prescribe the time for recommendation and grant of sanction under Section 45. The 2008 Rules are unequivocal in both, using the word ‘shall’ as also providing a specific time period for both activities, i.e., making recommendation and granting sanction. In the views of the High Courts discussed above, two have taken the view that the timelines are directory, while the other two hold them to be mandatory. In the former view, the word ‘shall’ is interpreted as ‘may’. At this juncture, it would be apposite to refer to certain pronouncements. Prior to going into that question, we may also refer to the well-established principles qua criminal statutes. 32.1 In Montreal Street Railway Company v. Normandin,42 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council considered the question of whether a certain provision in a statute imposing a duty on a public body or authority was mandatory or directory. The Court observed that: “…The question whether provisions in a statute are directory or imperative has very frequently arisen in this country, but it has been said that no general rule can be laid down, and that in every case the object of the statute must be looked at. The cases on the subject will be found collected in Maxwell on Statutes, 5th ed., p. 596 and following pages. When the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and the case is such that to hold null and void acts done in neglect of this duty would work serious general inconvenience, or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty, and at the same time would not promote 42 LR (1917) AC 170 358 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the main object of the Legislature, it has been the practice to hold such provisions to be directory only, the neglect of them, though punishable, not affecting the validity of the acts done.” 32.2 A Bench of five learned Judges in State of U.P.
