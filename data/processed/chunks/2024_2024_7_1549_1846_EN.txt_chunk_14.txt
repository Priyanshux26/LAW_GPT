[Paras 170, 172, 175, 178, 179, 185, 187, 188] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1567 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. Constitution of India – Entry 50 List II – Limitations on the taxing power of the State under Entry 50 List II – Entry 50 List II, if constitutes an exception to the Sundararamier principle: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI) (for himself and for Hrishikesh Roy, Abhay S Oka, J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, Satish Chandra Sharma and Augustine George Masih, JJ.) Entry 50 List II is unique because though it is a taxing entry, it is made subject to “any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development” – Thus, the taxing power of the state is capable of being controlled by a non-fiscal enactment by Parliament relating to the development of minerals – This seems to recognize that a fiscal imposition in the nature of a tax on mineral rights by a state may impact on the development of minerals – Position enunciated in Sundararamier’s case is that the field of taxation is distinct from the general subjects of legislation in the Union and State lists of the Seventh Schedule – While Entry 50 List II is sui generis, it does not constitute an exception to the Sundararamier’s principle – Entry 50 List II is subordinated only to the extent of any limitations that may be imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development – Unless Parliament imposes a limitation, the plenary power of the state legislature to levy taxes on mineral rights is unaffected – Question of an overlap between the taxing entry and general entry does not arise because Parliament cannot impose taxes on minerals under Entry 54 List I – There is no direct conflict between the taxing powers of the States under Entry 50 List II and regulatory powers of the Union. [Paras 190, 192, 205, 207] Constitution of India – Taxing powers of the states – Limitations imposed by Parliament – Nature of – Determination: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI) (for himself and for Hrishikesh Roy, Abhay S Oka, J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, Satish Chandra Sharma and Augustine George Masih, JJ.) There is a distinction between the nature of the restraints imposable by Parliament on the legislative field of the states to regulate mines and development of minerals, the Parliamentary restraints contemplated on the taxing power of the states over mineral rights – In relation to the former, distinction emerges from the language of Entry 54 List I and Entry 23 List II and as regards the latter, it is Entry 1568 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 50 List II – Relationship between Entry 23 List II and Entry 54 List I is that the latter results in a denudation of the legislative field of the states to the extent envisaged by Parliament by law – Expression ‘extent’ leaves it entirely to Parliament to determine whether the extent of the control by the Union is to be total or partial – Denudation of the legislative field of the states follows such a declaration by Parliament and the extent would be determined by the MMDR Act enacted by Parliament – Entry 50 List II gives the legislative field of taxing mineral rights to the states however, subject to limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development – Entry 50 List II does not result in the field of taxing mineral rights being conferred on Parliament, because there is no specific entry in List I giving the field of taxing mineral rights to the Union – Field of taxing mineral rights is exclusive to the states and continues to remain with them but subject to limitations imposed by Parliamentary law relating to mineral development – Parliament can determine as to how the taxing power of the states over mineral rights should be limited in to ensure that it does not impede or retard mineral development – If Parliament does so and indicates the nature of the limitations, states are bound to abide by them while exercising the taxing power over mineral rights.
