Therefore, on this sole ground, the High Court concluded in paragraph 22 of the impugned that the ED has to await the outcome of the proceedings for quashing the criminal complaints, in which a stay was in force. But the High Court made it clear that it was not entering upon the merits and demerits of the proceedings initiated by the ED and F the High Court left all the questions to be dealt with in appropriate proceedings. 63. Eventually, the High Court concluded in paragraph 23 of the impugned as follows: G “23. … Therefore, as we have concluded that in view of the quashing of the proceedings in C.C.No.25 of 2021 and staying of the proceedings in C.C.No.l9 of 2020 & C.C.No.24 of 2021 as highlighted above, the scheduled offence for the present is eclipsed, suspended or stop operating during the period of stay, the respondent Department has to await the finality of the said H Y. BALAJI v. KARTHIK DESARI & ANR. ETC. 1071 [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] proceedings. Needless to mention, if the proceedings in C.C.No.l9 A of 2020 and C.C.No.24 of 2021 are quashed pursuant to the s in the applications filed by the respective persons to quash the proceedings, in which event, the respondent cannot step in or initiate any proceedings under the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Vijay Madanlal B Chaudhary and others and in Parvathi Kollur and another v. State by Directorate of Enforcement, 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 688 cited supra. Therefore, the respondent is hereby refrained from proceeding any further pursuant to the impugned proceedings in ECIR/MDSZO/21/2021, till the disposal of the Criminal Revision Case No.224 of 2021, Criminal Original Petition C No.15122 of 2021 and the SLP (Crl) Diary No.9957 of 2022 (SLP (Crl) No.3841 of 2022).” 64. Irrespective of the correctness of the reasonings given by the High Court in the impugned , the conclusion of the High Court was only this, namely, that the ED cannot proceed, till the disposal of (i) D Criminal Revision Case No.224 of 2021 filed by Minister-Senthil Balaji against the of the Trial Court refusing to discharge him; and (ii) Criminal O.P. No.15122 of 2021, filed by Devasagayam seeking de novo investigation. 65. Therefore, it is as clear as crystal, that the High Court, in the E impugned dated 01.09.2022 has given only a temporary reprieve to the accused against the summons issued by the ED. Today, Criminal Revision Case No.224 of 2021 filed by the Minister against the dismissal of his discharge petition, has been rejected by the High Court by its dated 31.10.2022. Though Criminal O.P. No.15122 of 2021, filed F by Devasagayam has been allowed by the High Court, by the very same dated 31.10.2022, the said has been set aside by us in Part- I of this . 66. Insofar as the SLP (Crl.) No.3941 of 2022 @ Diary No.9957 of 2022 is concerned, it arises out of the of the High Court dated G 30.03.2022, which again is the subject matter of the present appeals.
