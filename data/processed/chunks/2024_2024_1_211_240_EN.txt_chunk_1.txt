229 – High Court, acting u/Art. 226, cannot usurp the functions of the executive and compel the executive to exercise its rule- making power in the manner directed by it – Compelling the State Government to mandatorily notify the Rules by the next date of hearing, in the First Impugned , virtually amounted to the High Court issuing a writ of mandamus to notify the Rules proposed by the Chief Justice – Such directions by the High Court are impermissible and contrary to the separation of powers envisaged by the Constitution – High Court, acting on the judicial side, could not compel the State Government to notify Rules proposed by the Chief Justice in the purported exercise of his administrative powers – Thus, the High Court acted beyond its jurisdiction u/Art. 226 by frequently summoning officers to expedite the consideration of the Rules and issuing directions to notify the Rules by a fixed date, under the threat of criminal contempt.
