G 117. To establish that A-7 filed applications with different banks for the issue of demand drafts in the names of four bogus firms, the prosecution examined PW-22, a Senior Manager of Indian Bank, PW- 32, the Branch Manager of State Bank of India, PW-40, the Senior Manager of Bank of Madura, PW-41, the Chief Manager of State Bank H of Mysore and PW-30, the handwriting expert. The prosecution marked A. SRINIVASULU v. THE STATE REP. BY THE INSPECTOR OF 69 POLICE [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] Exhibits P-66, P-76, P-90 and P-92, which were the applications submitted A in the names of the four bogus firms, to these banks for the issue of demand drafts. 118. PW-22 through whom Exhibit P-66 was marked did not say even in the chief-examination that the application form was signed by A-7. PW-32 through whom Exhibit P-76 was marked, stated in the chief- B examination that on the date of the application for the issue of demand draft he was not working in that branch and that he joined the branch six years later. He also admitted that he could not know anything about the demand draft application personally. But he claimed in the chief- examination that A-6, the father of A-5 and A-7, was the owner of the C premises in which the branch was located and that he could identify the signature of A-7 in Exhibit P-76. However, in cross-examination he admitted: “the applicant’s signature was available in the branch. I did not compare the specimen signature with the signature in the DD Application. When I was examined by CBI, I did not ask for the D specimen signature of the applicant.” 119. PW-40 through whom Exhibit P-90 was marked, did not say anything in the chief-examination that A-7 signed the application form E for demand draft. He merely identified the demand draft application form and the party on whose behalf the demand draft was taken. In other words, PW-40, like PW-22 did not implicate A-7 as the person who signed the application for the issue of demand draft on behalf of some bogus firms. 120. PW-41 through whom Exhibit P-92 was marked, merely stated F as to who obtained the demand draft. He did not also specifically name A-7 as the person who signed the application form or who received the demand draft. 121. In fact, PW-40 stated that no statement under Section 161 of the Code was recorded by the I.O. though he was examined. Similarly, G PW-41 stated that he was examined by the Inspector, CBI but he did not know whether a statement under Section 161 was recorded. 122. Thus, three out of four bank officials examined by the prosecution to show that A-7 applied for demand drafts on behalf of four bogus firms, did not identify A-7 as the person who applied for the H 70 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A demand drafts. They did not also identify the handwriting in Exhibits P- 66, P-90 and P-92 as that of A-7.
