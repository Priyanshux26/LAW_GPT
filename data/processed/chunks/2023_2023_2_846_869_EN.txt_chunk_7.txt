15. Shri Jaideep Gupta, Advocate appearing for the Respondent, SPML, has submitted that the legal principles governing an application under Section 11(6) of the Act are well-settled following the decisions of F this Court in Mayavati Trading (supra) and Vidya Drolia (supra). At the pre-referral stage, the jurisdiction of the court is restricted to the examination of whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties. He submitted that the decision of the High Court was unexceptionable, since the question as to whether the Settlement G 6 (2019) 8 SCC 714. 7 (2021) 2 SCC 1. (hereinafter ‘Vidya Drolia’) 8 (2017) 9 SCC 729. 9 (2021) 9 SCC 732. 10 (2020) 4 SCC 621. 11 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1328. H 856 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A Agreement was executed under undue influence or coercion could be determined by an Arbitral Tribunal. 16. Position of Law: In the present case, we are concerned with the pre-referral jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 11 of the Act and would like to underscore the limited scope within B which an application under Section 11(6)12 of the Act has to be considered. 17. The position of law with respect to the pre-referral jurisdiction, as it existed before the advent of Section 11(6A) in the Act, was based on a well-articulated principle formulated by this C Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd13. In Boghara Polyfab, this Court held that the issue of non-arbitrability of a dispute will have to be examined by the court in cases where accord and discharge of the contract is alleged. Following the principle in Boghara Polyfab, this Court in Union of India & Ors. v. Master D Construction Co.14 observed that when the validity of a discharge voucher, no-claim certificate or a settlement agreement is in dispute, the court must prima facie examine the credibility of the allegations before referring the parties to arbitration. Yet again in New India E 12Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (Act 26 of 1996), Section 11(6): “(6)Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties,— (a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or (b) the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an agreement expected of them under that procedure; or (c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to him or it under that procedure, a party may request 1 [the Supreme Court or, F as the case may be, the High Court or any person or institution designated by such Court]to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment.” 13 (2009) 1 SCC 267. 14 (2011) 12 SCC 349: “18. In our opinion, there is no rule of the absolute kind. In a case where the claimant contends that a discharge voucher or no-claim certificate has been obtained G by fraud, coercion, duress or undue influence and the other side contests the correctness thereof, the Chief Justice/his designate must look into this aspect to find out at least, prima facie, whether or not the dispute is bona fide and genuine.
