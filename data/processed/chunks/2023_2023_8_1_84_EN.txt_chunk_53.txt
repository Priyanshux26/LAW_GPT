“7.3 List 33 specifies by name the thermal projects and hydel projects in respect of which exemption is made applicable. Then, F under Customs Notification No. 100 of 99 dated 28/7/99, the capacity of thermal power project specified in the earlier notification was altered from 1500 to 1000 MW. As a result of this notification, 7 more thermal projects were added to the list.” “7.4 Then, the next notifications in succession are Customs G Notification No. 16 of 2000 and 17 of 2001 which are substantially the same excepting that the number of thermal and hydel projects specified in List 33 has gone down.” “7.5 Then comes the Customs Notification No. 21 of 2002 dated 01.03.2002 which is material for our purpose. It reads as follows:- H HARYANA POWER PURCHASE CENTRE v. SASAN POWER 71 LTD. & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] A B C “7.6 Entry 400 was amended by the Notification No. 26/2003. The said amendment was necessitated by reason of the policy decision taken by the Government as reflected in the Union budget speech of 203-04. The following extract from the budged speech is relevant: D “Simultaneous to the emphasis on improvement in power distribution, our attention on capacity addition remains. The Government had earlier, in 1999, notified 18 power projected as mega projects, conferring upon them various duty and licensing benefits. The Government now proposes to liberalise the mega E power project policy further by extending all these benefits to any power project that fulfills the conditions already prescribed for mega power projects”. Pursuant to the above policy, Notification No. 26/2003-Cus. Was issued amending the notification no. 21/2002-Cus. Entry 400 as F amended reads: G H 72 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A “7.7 The amended notification no. 21 of 2002 is almost in the same language as it stands now (vide para 3 supra). Thus, w.e.f. 1/4/2003, the list of specified power projects has been deleted in tune with the liberalized policy of the Government. Further, it is to be mentioned that Entry 400 of notification no.21 of 2002 was further amended keeping in view the revised policy guidelines B issued in to cater to the special requirements of power projects in Jammu and Kashmir and NE States. Entry 399 substantially remained the same from 1999 onwards excepting that there was change in the Sl. No. and the rate.” (113) The of the Advance Ruling Authority is dated C 19.12.2008. No doubt, it is after the cut off date. The case of the first respondent is not based on the of the Advance Ruling Authority. The case of the first respondent is specifically based only on the OM issued by the Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Power. We may notice that Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Power has a role in terms of the D notification. The role assigned to him is contained in condition 82 to the notification 63/1999 and this condition has continued thereafter also. The condition as we have noticed is that it is stated that an officer not below the rank of a Joint Secretary is to certify the aspects which are mentioned in condition 82.
