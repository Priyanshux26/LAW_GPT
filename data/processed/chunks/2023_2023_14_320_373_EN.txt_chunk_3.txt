The reference to the three Judge Bench 1. A child born to parents whose marriage is null and void under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act 19551 is declared to “be legitimate” by Section 16 (1) if a child “of such marriage... would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid.” Likewise, where a decree of nullity has 1 The Hindu Marriage Act 1955 (HMA) 326 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. been granted under Section 12 in respect of a voidable marriage, a child “begotten or conceived before the decree is made” is “deemed to be their legitimate child” if such a child would have been the legitimate child of the parties to the marriage if the marriage had been dissolved instead of being annulled2. Section 16(3) enunciates that a child of a marriage that is null or void or which is annulled by a decree of nullity shall not have “any rights in or to the property of any person, other than the parents” where but for the enactment of the legislation such a child would be incapable of possessing or acquiring any such rights “by reason of his not being the legitimate child of his parents”. 2. Several decisions of this Court have considered the nature of the property rights conferred on children of parents whose marriage is either void or in respect of which a decree of nullity has been passed under Section 12.
