Headnotes Curative Petition – Curative Jurisdiction may be invoked if there is a miscarriage of justice: Held: The Supreme Court laid down an overarching principle in Rupa Hurra v. Ashok Hurra [2002] 2 SCR 1006 that the Court may entertain a curative petition to (i) prevent abuse of its process; and (ii) to cure a gross miscarriage of justice – The enumeration of the situations in which the curative jurisdiction can be exercised is not intended to be exhaustive – The Court went on to lay down certain procedural requirements to entertain a curative petition such as a certificate by a Senior Advocate about fulfilling of the requirements. [Paras 33 and 34] Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 – s.34 – Scope of interference of courts with arbitral awards: Held: Section 34 of the Arbitration Act delineates the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award – In addition to the grounds on which an arbitral award can be assailed laid down in section 34(2), there is another ground for challenge against domestic awards, such as the award in the present case – Under Section 34(2-A) of the Arbitration Act, a domestic award may be set aside if the * Author 474 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Court finds that it is vitiated by ‘patent illegality’ appearing on the face of the award. [Paras 36, 37] Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 – s.34 – Setting aside of domestic award – Ground of patent illegality: Held: The ground of patent illegality is available for setting aside a domestic award, if the decision of the arbitrator is found to be perverse, or so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at it; or the construction of the contract is such that no fair or reasonable person would take; or, that the view of the arbitrator is not even a possible view – A ‘finding’ based on no evidence at all or an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside under the head of ‘patent illegality’ – An award without reasons would suffer from patent illegality – The arbitrator commits a patent illegality by deciding a matter not within his jurisdiction or violating a fundamental principle of natural justice.
