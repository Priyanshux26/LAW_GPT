10. The argument raised by the learned counsel for the appellants that there is no bar under Rule 28A of the Kerala Service Rules, 1959 C for grant of such benefit is merely to be noticed and rejected as the entire scheme has to be read in totality. Grant of promotional benefits to the category of persons to which the appellants belong would mean granting them double benefit. Firstly, they already got in the University they were working when they were promoted as Assistant Grade-I and secondly when they were promoted on the same post in transferee D University. 11. We do not find any error in the passed by the Division Bench of the High Court. 12. At the time of the hearing, it was submitted that all the appellants E who were given the benefits have retired from service and recoveries were sought to be made from them though they were not at fault in grant of those benefits at the time of promotion. Considering the aforesaid fact and keeping in view the of this Court in State of Punjab and Others v. Rafiq Masih (White Washter) & Ors.1, we direct that no recovery of the amount already paid to them be effected. However, F their pension can be refixed considering the emoluments to which the appellants were entitled at the time of their retirement in accordance with the rules. 13. The Appeals are disposed of accordingly. G Nidhi Jain Appeals disposed of. (Assisted by : Shraddha Singh, LCRA) 1 (2015) 4 SCC 334 H
