As per the Rule 19(3), in case the disciplinary proceedings under the relevant rules of service have been initiated against an officer before he ceases to be in the Bank’s service by operation of, or by virtue of any of the rules, the disciplinary proceedings may at the discretion of C Managing Director be continued and concluded, as if the officer had continued to be in service. However, the officer in that case shall be deemed to be in service only for the purpose of the continuance and conclusion of such proceedings. 11. So far as the facts of the present case are concerned, the disciplinary proceedings against the respondent were already initiated D and had stood concluded, culminating into dismissal from service as per the dated 11.08.1999 passed by the Appointing Authority. The said was challenged by the respondent by filing the Writ Petition, which came to be allowed by the Single Bench on 26.03.2003 whereby the of dismissal was set aside, nonetheless the Appellant-Bank having preferred the LPA No. 378 of 2003, the Division Bench had stayed the E operation and implementation of the said passed by the Single Bench on 09.05.2003. The said LPA came to be dismissed on 22.04.2010, in the meantime on 30.11.2009, the respondent attained the age of superannuation i.e., during the time, when the operation of the of Single Bench was stayed. Thus, the of Single Bench setting aside the of dismissal passed by the Appointing Authority having been F stayed by the Division Bench, the respondent could not be deemed to have continued in service, and also when he had attained the age of superannuation on 30.11.2009. Thereafter, the of Division Bench dated 22.04.2010 passed in the LPA 378 of 2003 having been set aside by this Court while allowing the appeal filed by the Appellant-Bank vide the dated 25.11.2013, again it could not be said that the respondent G was continued in service, till he attained the age of superannuation. 12. The reliance placed by the learned counsel for the respondent on Rule 19(3) of the Rules is also thoroughly misplaced in as much as Rule 19(3) contemplates a situation, when the disciplinary proceedings against a bank officer, have already been initiated, and are pending when the officer ceases to be in the Bank’s service, and in that case the H 900 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A Managing Director in his discretion may continue and conclude the disciplinary proceedings against the officer as if the officer continues to be in service. However, in the instant case, there was no question of Managing Director exercising such discretion under Rule 19(3) as the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the respondent had already culminated into his dismissal as per the dated 11.08.1999 passed B by the Appointing Authority. Though the said of dismissal was set aside by the Single Bench, the of Single Bench had remained stayed pending the LPA filed by the Bank; and though the LPA was dismissed by the Division Bench, the said in LPA was set aside by this Court, observing that the person who hears the matter has to decide it.
