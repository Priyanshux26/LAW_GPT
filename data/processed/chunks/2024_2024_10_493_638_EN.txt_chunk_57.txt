3 SCR 284 : AIR 1993 SC 1126 216 [1995] 1 SCR 897 : 1995 INSC 99 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 577 Sukanya Shantha v. Union of India & Ors. demand statutory protection, vested interests try to cow them down and terrorise them” if they are on anticipatory bail. For this reason, the Court dismissed a challenge to Section 18 of the PoA Act, which debarred the opportunity to seek anticipatory bail in respect of offences committed under the Act. 129. In Safai Karamchari Andolan v. Union of India,217 the Court noted that “the practice of manual scavenging has to be brought to a close”. Making a “member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe to do manual scavenging or employing or permiting the employment of such member for such purpose” is a criminal offence under the PoA Act.218 The Court took a step further, and held that “entering sewer lines without safety gears should be made a crime even in emergency situations”. The Court declared that for a death in sewer lines, “compensation of Rs. 10 lakhs should be given to the family of the deceased”. It was emphasized that “Persons released from manual scavenging should not have to cross hurdles to receive” compensation or rehabilitation “due under the law”. 130. The Court showed a deep concern about non-implementation of the PoA Act in National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights v. Union of India.219 It remarked that “there has been a failure on the part of the authorities concerned in complying with the provisions” of the PoA Act. Calling out the “indifferent attitude of the authorities”, the Court directed the State and the Union governments to strictly do their role in implementing the Act. 131. These rulings emphasized that the PoA Act is a significant legislative measure designed to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, ensuring their dignity and safety against discrimination and violence. However, the subsequent in Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra220 marked a departure from this protective stance. 132. Dealing with a criminal appeal, the in Subhash Mahajan expressed a “concern that working of the Atrocities [PoA] Act should not result in perpetuating casteism which can have an adverse 217 [2014] 4 SCR 197 : (2014) 11 SCC 224 218 Section 3(j), Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 219 [2016] 9 SCR 122 : AIR 2017 SC 132 220 [2018] 4 SCR 877 : 2018 INSC 248 578 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports impact on integration of the society and the constitutional values”. It held that there is “no absolute bar against grant of anticipatory bail” by the concerned court “in cases under the Atrocities [PoA] Act if no prima facie case is made out or where on judicial scrutiny the complaint is found to be prima facie mala fide”. The Court issued the following guidelines: “(iii) In view of acknowledged abuse of law of arrest in cases under the Atrocities Act, arrest of a public servant can only be after approval of the appointing authority and of a non-public servant after approval by the S.S.P.
