480-81, paras 15-16) “I. Approbate and reprobate 15. A party cannot be permitted to “blow hot-blow cold”, “fast and loose” or “approbate and reprobate”. Where one knowingly accepts the benefi ts of a contract, or conveyance, or of an , he is estopped from denying the validity of, or the binding eff ect of such contract, or conveyance, or upon himself. This rule is applied to ensure equity, however, it must not be applied in such a manner so as to violate the principles of what is right and of good conscience. [Vide Nagubai Ammal v. B. Shama Rao [1956 SCR 451 : AIR 1956 SC 593], CIT v. V. MR. P. Firm Muar [ AIR 1965 SC 1216], Ramesh Chandra Sankla v. Vikram Cement [(2008) 14 SCC 58 : (2009) 1 SCC (L&S) 706], Pradeep Oil Corpn. v. MCD [(2011) 5 SCC 270 : (2011) 2 SCC (Civ) 712], Cauvery Coff ee Traders v. Hornor Resources (International) Co. Ltd. [(2011) 10 SCC 420 : (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 685] and V. Chandrasekaran v. Administrative Offi cer [(2012) 12 SCC 133 : (2013) 2 SCC (Civ) 136 : (2013) 4 SCC (Cri) 587 : (2013) 3 SCC (L&S) 416]. 16. Thus, it is evident that the doctrine of election is based on the rule of estoppel—the principle that one cannot approbate and reprobate is inherent in it. The doctrine of estoppel by election is one among the species of estoppel in pais (or equitable estoppel), which is a rule of equity. By this law, a person may be precluded, by way of his actions, MUMTAZ YARUD DOWLA WAKF v. M/S BADAM 997 BALAKRISHNA HOTEL PVT. LTD. & ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] or conduct, or silence when it is his duty to speak, from asserting a right which he would have otherwise had.” (emphasis supplied) 16. There is a subtle diff erence when we deal with a case involving coram non-judice. The principle governing lack of jurisdiction to a forum may diff er from a case where two or more forums deal with the same issue along with the rights and liabilities of the parties. To make the position clear, one has to see as to whether there is any change in the rights and liabilities of the parties by choosing one forum as against the other. As an example, we can take the case of eviction of a tenant. If he is to be evicted only under the Rent Control Act which extends a certain right to the tenant, who cannot be evicted otherwise than under the provisions contained therein, a common law remedy cannot be invoked by way of a suit as against a proceeding before the Rent Controller. In that view of the matter, certainly the question of prejudice would arise. However, in a case involving same rights and liabilities but the question is only with respect to the forum being judicial or quasi-judicial, the issue of jurisdiction would pale into insignifi cance when it is sought to be raised as a last straw at a very belated stage.
