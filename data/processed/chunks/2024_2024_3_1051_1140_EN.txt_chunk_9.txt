13. The Railway Claims Tribunal, Ghaziabad vide its common final judgement and dated 26.12.2013, dismissed the remaining 77 claim applications of the respondent as being time-barred. The said decision of the RCT is in two parts: - (i) First, the RCT observed that though the chargeable distance was only 334 km still the freight charges had been levied for a distance of 444 km. This according to the Tribunal was a case of excess payment of freight, and thus the refund that was sought was for an ‘overcharge’. The relevant observations read as under: - “18. [...] In this case, the goods were booked from ‘A’ to ‘B’, showing the chargeable distance as 444 Kms. and payment was given by the applicant company for the same distance, but later on, Railways reworked the chargeable distance as only 333.18 Kms. The consignment in question was carried through the same route. So, it is clear that the payment was to be made for 333.18 Kms., whereas it was made for 444 Kms. In this way, the applicant company had to pay for 444 Kms, instead of 333.18 Kms. Hence, the present case is for the refund of this excess payment of freight, which can only be termed as refund of overcharge and nothing else and so, the notice under Section 106(3) of the Railways Act, 1989 is necessary.” (Emphasis supplied) (ii) Secondly, since the case at hand was one for refund of an overcharge and the notice of claim had not been sent within the prescribed time-period of 6-months as required under Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, the claim application was time-barred. The relevant observations read as under: - “24. [...] Furthermore, perusal of the record shows that the applicant company had served a notice on 07.11.2005 upon the Respondent Railway, but the 1066 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports date of booking of the consignment in question was 25.08.2002. Hence, it has been revealed that the said notice was time barred as per the provisions of the aforesaid Section 106(3) of the Railways Act, 1989, which had been well within the knowledge of the applicant company also as per the aforesaid letter dated 28.01.2009. In this context, Ld. Counsel for the Respondent has placed reliance on the case law, titled as Birla Cement Works v. G.M., Western Railways & Anr., 1995 SCC (2) 493. We have carefully perused the said case law and it supports the contention of the Respondent Railway. xxx xxx xxx 26. In view of the above, it has been held the applicant company has not served a valid and legal notice on the Respondent Railway within the statutory period under the provisions of Section 106(3) of the Railways Act, 1989. As such, the applicant company is not entitled for any compensation. [...]” (Emphasis supplied) 14. Thus, the RCT, whilst dismissing the respondent’s claim applications held that, the respondent’s claim was for a refund of an overcharge and since the notice of claim was not served in terms of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, the claim was time-barred.
