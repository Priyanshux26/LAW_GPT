It is submitted that, unless there is a factual basis in the suit itself, no legal arguments arising therefrom can be entertained.

Janardhan Kashinath Kadam (Dead) By LRs and Others3 and the of the Privy Council in the case of Attorney-General of the Colony of Fiji v. J.P. Bayly Limited.4 9.

He submitted that, even for a moment, if it is assumed that CBI is an instrumentality of the State under Article 12 of the Constitution, still the suit would not be maintainable. It is submitted that the expanded meaning given to the term ‘State’ under 1 [2010] 7 SCR 790 : (2010) 7 SCC 417 : 2010 INSC 362 2 [2022] 7 SCR 231 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1312 : 2022 INSC 1032 3 [1998] Supp. 2 SCR 669 : (1998) 8 SCC 315 : 1998 INSC 425 4 1949 SCC OnLine PC 76 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 685 The State of West Bengal v. Union of India Article 12 of the Constitution cannot be made applicable to the term ‘Union’ or ‘State’ mentioned under Article 131 of the Constitution. Reliance in this respect is placed on the Constitution Bench s of this Court in the cases of State of Bihar v. Union of India and Another,5 State of Rajasthan and Others v. Union of India and Others6 and Tashi Delek Gaming Solutions Limited and Another v. State of Karnataka and Others.7 10. The learned Solicitor General further submitted that the dispute, at the most, is between the State of West Bengal and the CBI. Reliance in this respect is placed on the of this Court in the case of National Textile Corporation Limited v. Nareshkumar Badrikumar Jagad and Others.8 11. Relying on the of this Court in the case of Vineet Narain and Others v. Union of India and Another,9 the learned Solicitor General further submitted that the responsibility of superintendence over the CBI’s functioning has been entrusted with the Central Vigilance Commission (for short “CVC”). It is submitted that CVC is an independent body appointed by an independent collegium. It is submitted that this Court has clearly emphasized that the CBI has to be viewed as a non-partisan agency. It is submitted that no control is vested with the Central Government insofar as CBI is concerned. The learned Solicitor General submitted that Section 8 of the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as “CVC Act”) would make it clear that the CBI is under superintendence of the CVC and not the Union of India. He submitted that the proviso to Section 8(1)(b) of the CVC Act makes it clear that even the CVC is not empowered to exercise powers in such a manner so as to require the Delhi Special Police Establishment (for short, “DSPE”) to investigate or dispose of any case in a particular manner.
