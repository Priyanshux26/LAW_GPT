The said case is inapplicable to the facts of the present case for the reason that the said case pertains to the right of a widow to adopt and the right of inheritance of a child so adopted. The present case is concerned only with the definition of ‘family’ under the CCS (Pension) Rules. The said G definition is a restrictive and specific one and cannot be expanded to take within its sweep, all heirs, as provided under Hindu law, or other personal laws. It is trite that in construing a word in a statute, caution has to be exercised in adopting a meaning ascribed to that word or concept in another statute. H 948 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R.
