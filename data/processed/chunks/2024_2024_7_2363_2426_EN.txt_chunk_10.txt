If the arrest itself is unconstitutional viz. Article 22(1) of the Constitution, the remand would not cure the constitutional infirmities attached 13 [2023] 12 SCR 853 : (2024) 3 SCC 51 14 [1969] 3 SCR 154 : (1969) 1 SCC 292 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2377 Arvind Kejriwal v. Directorate of Enforcement to such arrest. The principle stands expanded, as the violation of Section 19(1) of the PML Act will equally vitiate the arrest. 15. In Pankaj Bansal (supra), one of the contentions raised by the DoE was that the legality of arrest is rendered immaterial once the competent court passes an of remand. Reliance was placed on certain s. However, these s were distinguished on the ground that they primarily addressed writs of habeas corpus following remand s by the jurisdictional court. Therefore, the ratios therein are not applicable to this scenario. In the context of statutory compliance, the Court observed in clear terms that if the arrest is not in conformity with Section 19(1) of the PML Act, the mere passing of an of remand, in itself, would not be sufficient to validate the person’s arrest. Thus, notwithstanding the of remand, the issue whether the arrest of the person is lawful at its inception, is open for consideration and must be answered. 16. Recently, in Prabir Purkayastha v. State (NCT of Delhi),15 this Court reiterated the aforesaid principles expounded in Pankaj Bansal (supra). The said principles were applied to the pari materia provisions16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The Court explained that Section 19(1) of the PML Act is meant to serve a higher purpose, and also to enforce the mandate of Article 22(1) of the Constitution. The right to life and personal liberty is sacrosanct, a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 and protected by Articles 20 and 22 of the Constitution. Reference was made to the observations of this Court in Roy V.D. v. State of Kerala17 that the right to be informed about the grounds of arrest flows from Article 22(1) of the Constitution and any infringement of this fundamental right vitiates the process of arrest and remand. The fact that the chargesheet has been filed in the matter would not validate the otherwise illegality and unconstitutionality committed at the time of arrest and grant of remand custody of the accused. Reference is also made to the principle behind Article 22(5) of the Constitution. Thus, this Court held that not complying with the constitutional mandate under Article 22(1) and the statutory mandate of the UAPA, on the requirement to 15 2024 SCC OnLine SC 934 16 Sections 43A, 43B and 43C of the UAPA. 17 [2000] Supp. 4 SCR 539 : (2000) 8 SCC 590 2378 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports communicate grounds of arrest or grounds of detention, would lead to the custody or detention being rendered illegal. 17. In Vijay Madanlal Choudhary and others v. Union of India and others,18 a three Judge Bench of this Court distinguished between the stringent requirements stipulated in Section 19(1) of the PML Act, and the power of arrest given to the police in cognisable offences under Section 41 of the Code.19 Reference was made to Section 104 of the Customs Act, 1962,20 which was elucidated and considered 18 [2022] 6 SCR 382 : (2022) SCC Online SC 929 19 “41.
