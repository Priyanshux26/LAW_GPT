[Paras 21-25, 28, 30, and 31] Income Tax Rules, 1962 – Rule 3(7)(i) – not arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution insofar as it treats the PLR of SBI as the benchmark. Held: The fixation of SBI’s rate of interest as the benchmark is neither an arbitrary nor unequal exercise of power – The rule- making authority has not treated unequal as equals – The benefit enjoyed by bank employees from interest-free loans or loans at a concessional rate is a unique benefit/advantage enjoyed by them – It is in the nature of a ‘perquisite’, and hence is liable to taxation – Rule 3(7)(i) is not arbitrary or irrational for the reason it benchmarks computation of the perquisite with reference to 910 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the SBI’s PLR – SBI is the largest bank in the country and the interest rates fixed by them invariably impact and affect the interest rates being charged by other banks – By fixing a single clear benchmark for computation of the perquisite or fringe benefit, the rule prevents ascertainment of the interest rates being charged by different banks from the customers and, thus, checks unnecessary litigation – Rule 3(7)(i) ensures consistency in application, provides clarity for both the assessee and the revenue department, and provides certainty as to the amount to be taxed – When there is certainty and clarity, there is tax efficiency which is beneficial to both the tax payer and the tax authorities – These are all hallmarks of good tax legislation – Rule 3(7)(i) is based on a uniform approach and yet premised on a fair determining principle which aligns with constitutional values – When it comes to uniform approach the laws relating to fiscal or tax measures enjoy greater latitude than other statutes – Commercial and tax legislations tend to be highly sensitive and complex as they deal with multiple problems and are contingent – To interfere with the legislation in question, which prevents possibilities of abuse and promotes certainty – It is not iniquitous, draconian or harsh on the taxpayers – A complex problem has been solved through a straitjacket formula, meriting judicial acceptance – To hold otherwise, would lead to multiple problems/issues and override the legislative wisdom – The universal test in the present case is pragmatic, fair and just – Therefore, Rule 3(7) is held to be intra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
