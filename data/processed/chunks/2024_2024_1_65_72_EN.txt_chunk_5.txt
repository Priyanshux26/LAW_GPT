DIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS 14. Relying upon the above in the case of Dharam Vir Anand (supra), this Court again in the case of Life Insurance Corpn. of India vs. Mani Ram5, reiterated the same view and held that the date of issue of policy would be the relevant date even if there was backdating as has been done in the case of Dharam Vir Anand (supra). 15. In the present appeals, we do not find any such issue of back dating but the date of issuance of the policy would be the relevant date for all the purposes and not the date of proposal or the date of issuance of the receipt. In view of the above, the stand taken by the appellant is approved. The impugned s are thus liable to be set aside. 16. Accordingly, the s passed by the District Forum, the State Commission, and the National Commission are set aside and the claims of the respondent are rejected. The appeals are accordingly, allowed as above. 17. There shall be no as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey Result of the case: Appeals allowed. 5 (2005) 6 SCC 274
