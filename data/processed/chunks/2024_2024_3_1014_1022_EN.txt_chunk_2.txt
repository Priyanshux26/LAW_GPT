The Superintendent of Police, Aurangabad (Rural), on complaint made by the appellant and others, directed the Sub Divisional Police Officer, Paithan on 07.07.2015 to initiate inquiry on the entire issue and submit report. The Sub Divisional Police Officer, Paithan conducted inquiry relating to the complaint made against the respondent no.2, directing both the appellant and respondent no.2 and other Police officers/ constables to appear and submit their statements. In his report dated 11.09.2015, it was recorded that on 19.06.2015 the appellant was taken out from the lock-up by the respondent no.2 and paraded on the streets of the city of Paithan and was also physically assaulted during the said procession and held respondent no.2 responsible for this. It further narrated that despite grant of bail to the appellant he was illegally detained by respondent no.2 for four hours. 11. On 08.10.2015 and 09.10.2015, the sister of the appellant complained to various authorities including the Superintendent of Police, Aurangabad (Rural) and the President [read Chairperson], National Human Rights Commission (hereinafter referred to as 1018 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the “Commission”) seeking initiation of departmental enquiry and criminal prosecution under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (hereinafter referred to as the “SC/ST Act”). 12. On 25.12.2015, the appellant was charge-sheeted in connection with another FIR bearing Crime No.1-192/2015 punishable under Section 3944, IPC and he was sought to be declared a Proclaimed Offender despite him being available in town and co-operating with the investigating agency.

The Special Inspector General of Police, Aurangabad Range, Aurangabad, after perusing the Inquiry Report of the Sub Divisional Police Officer dated 11.09.2015 and not finding the explanation of respondent no.2 to be satisfactory, imposed punishment of “strict warning”. 14. The appellant on 02.02.2017, approached the High Court by way of filing Writ Petition, inter alia, praying for initiation of departmental inquiry and criminal proceedings against respondent no.2 and also sought compensation. The writ petition was partly allowed by the Impugned by awarding Rs.75,000/- (Rupees Seventy Five Thousand only) to be payable to the appellant by respondent no.2 from his own pocket but declining to give any direction for initiating criminal action under the SC/ST Act. SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANT: 15. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that it would be a travesty of justice if for such blatant violation of the personal liberty of the appellant and abuse of authority, the respondent no.2 is let off with just “strict warning” without any real effective punishment. It was submitted that the conduct of the respondent no.2 besides being unprovoked was also in the teeth of the s of this Court in D K Basu v State of West Bengal, (1997) 1 SCC 416 and Sube Singh v State of Haryana, (2006) 3 SCC 178, which have laid down the guidelines of how a detenu has to be treated 4 ‘394.
