In Rosali (supra), the 25% bid amount under XXI Rule 84 of the CPC was directed to be paid the next day and it was so paid. While accepting it as a valid deposit, this Court quoted the following paragraph from the of the Karnataka High Court in Dakshayani vs. Branch Manager, Indian Overseas Bank, AIR 1998 Kant 114: “4. On that basis if we interpret the law though there is no power in the Court to extend the time fi xed by the statute still the expression immediately is capable of taking within its sweep a situation where an act is impossible of performance on the day on which the auction is held as it happened in Savithramma case [ILR 1973 Kant 1277] when the bank itself was on strike and no deposit could have been made in the bank or in the event the auction-sale is held after court hours, a receipt in that regard cannot be obtained for deposit of such an amount. Such amount could be deposited only after obtaining a receipt . If next day also happens to be a holiday, the day immediately thereafter coming up which is a working day will be the day on which such act will have to be performed. If any other interpretation is given it would stultify the very object of law.” 23. In view of the above, we have no hesitation to hold that the deposit of the additional performance security on 17.03.2021 was in due compliance of Clause 2.22.0 (ix) of the tender conditions. There was no breach of that clause. 388 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 24. Decision making authorities, like the tendering authority here, could not have turned a blind eye to undisputed ground realities and compelling necessities, like the one that presented itself here. After all, they do not live in ivory towers. 25. In this case, the tendering authority, after due verifi cation, about the non-operation of the banks on 15.03.2021 and 16.03.2021 due to the strike by the bank employees, had accepted the additional performance security on 17.03.2021 and awarded the work to the appellant. It is well settled by a long line of s that the owner or the employer of a project, having authored the tender documents, is the best person to understand and appreciate its requirements and interpret its documents. It has also been held that the constitutional courts must defer to this understanding and appreciation of the tender documents by the employer unless there is mala fi de or perversity in the understanding or appreciation. [See Afcons Infrastructure Limited vs. Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Limited and Another, (2016) 16 SCC 818 and Ufl ex Limited Vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and Others, (2022) 1 SCC 165)]. 26. In this case, no mala fi de has been alleged and the interpretation as adopted by the tendering authority cannot be said to be perverse. We also do not fi nd that the decision to accept the additional performance security on 17.03.2021 and the issuance of the work was arbitrary and irrational.
