There is no explanation offered in the petition as to why there was complete inaction on the part of the petitioners from 2009 to 2016. Therefore, considering this conduct of the petitioners, they are dis-entitled to any relief. (vi) WP No.2170 of 2016 – Girdharlal D. Rughani Alia Thakkar H.U.F. and Another vs. The State of Maharashtra and Others.– 41. In Writ Petition No.2170/2016, the case of the petitioners is that on 20th October 1995 they handed over the possession of their land reserved for DP Road to the said Corporation. They claimed that after completing the construction of DP Road on 20th October 1994, a completion certificate was granted by the Municipal Corporation. It is not the case of the petitioners that thereafter they applied for grant of additional 100% TDR in respect of the amenity developed. Only on 5th August 2014 (i.e. ten years after developing the amenity) that the petitioners applied for grant of additional TDR through their Architect. For a period of 10 years, the petitioners never claimed 100% additional TDR in respect of the amenity. Even thereafter, no action is taken and the present petition is filed in July 2016. Considering the conduct of the petitioners, they are not entitled to any relief. (vii) WP No.384 of 2017 – Oberoi Realty Limited and Another vs. Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Others.– 42. In Writ Petition No.384/2017, the case of the petitioners is that between 2004 and 2008, they developed seven DP Roads and handed over the possession thereof to the said Corporation. However, they made representation for the first time on 10th June 878 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 2016 claiming additional TDR in respect of amenity developed. The representation was rejected on 30th November 2016 by the said Corporation. Thus, even after the decision in the case of Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (supra), the petitioners did not apply for grant of additional TDR. The petitioners sought additional TDR after lapse of eight years and more. Therefore, for a period of eight years or more, the petitioners never claimed additional TDR. Hence, considering the delay and laches on the part of the petitioners, no relief can be granted.
