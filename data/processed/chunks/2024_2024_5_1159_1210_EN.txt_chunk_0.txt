[2024] 5 S.C.R. 1159 : 2024 INSC 455 Government of NCT of Delhi & Anr. v. M/s BSK Realtors LLP & Anr. (Civil Appeal No. 6604 of 2024) 17 May 2024 [Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyan, JJ.] Issue for Consideration a) Whether the dismissal of a civil appeal preferred by one appellant in the first round operates as res judicata against the other appellant in the second round before this Court; b) Whether suppression of the first round of litigation by the appellants constitutes a material fact, thereby inviting an outright dismissal of the appeals at the threshold; c) Does the doctrine of merger operate as a bar to entertain the civil appeals in the present case; d) Whether the previous determination of the rights of subsequent purchasers in an inter se dispute precludes the same issue from being reconsidered between the same parties. Headnotes† Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 – Whether the dismissal of a civil appeal preferred by one appellant in the first round operates as res judicata against the other appellant in the second round before this Court: Held: In the lead matter before this Court or for that matter the other appeals, the co-respondents before the High Court, namely, GNCTD and DDA did not have conflicting interests – Inter se them, neither was there any disputed issue, nor could have the High Court possibly adjudicated on any such issue – Before this Court too, in the first round, there was no issue on which GNCTD and DDA were at loggerheads – In the light of this, in accordance with the legal principle, the applicability of res judicata is negated – Res judicata, as a technical legal principle, operates to prevent the same parties from relitigating the same issues that have already been conclusively determined by a court – However, it is crucial to note that the previous decision of this Court in the first round would not operate as res judicata to bar a decision on the lead matter and the 1160 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports other appeals; more so, because this rule may not apply hard and fast in situations where larger public interest is at stake – In such cases, a more flexible approach ought to be adopted by courts, recognizing that certain matters transcend individual disputes and have far-reaching public interest implications. [Paras 23 and 25] Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 – Whether suppression of the first round of litigation by the appellants constitutes a material fact, thereby inviting an outright dismissal of the appeals at the threshold: Held: Law is well settled that the fact suppressed must be material in the sense that it would have an effect on the merits of the case – The concept of suppression or non-disclosure of facts transcends mere concealment; it necessitates the deliberate withholding of material facts—those of such critical import that their absence would render any decision unjust – Material facts, in this context, refer to those facts that possess the potential to significantly influence the decision-making process or alter its trajectory – This principle is not intended to arm one party with a weapon of technicality over its adversary but rather serves as a crucial safeguard against the abuse of the judicial process – Nevertheless, this Court has carefully considered the s issued during the first round of litigation, which are alleged to have been suppressed – Despite reviewing these s, there are no compelling reason to dismiss the appeals based solely on the prior dismissal of appeals filed by some other appellant/ authority.
