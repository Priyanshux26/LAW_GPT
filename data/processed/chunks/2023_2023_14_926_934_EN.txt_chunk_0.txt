Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – Determination of fair and just compensation – Annual increase whether on cumulative basis or non- cumulative basis – Rate of applying annual increase – Period to be applied: Held: The consistent view taken by this Court for awarding annual increase to determine the just compensation varies from case to case and the period to be applied is a major factor to be considered – In the present case, the period is 11 years which is pretty large – Fair and reasonable compensation in the present case would be best determined if 8% annual increase is applied with cumulative eff ect as the gap is huge i.e. 11 years – For shorter period of 3-5 years, it could have been 10% or 12% – But in no case 15% would be justifi ed for a period of 11 years as awarded by the High Court – In the present case, given the 11 years gap, 8% would be just and proper – On rough assessment, the compensation would be equivalent to compensation awarded by the Reference Court – High Court fell in error in enhancing the compensation by applying the cumulative annual increase of 15% – Impugned set aside 926 THE CENTRAL WAREHOUSING CORP. v.
