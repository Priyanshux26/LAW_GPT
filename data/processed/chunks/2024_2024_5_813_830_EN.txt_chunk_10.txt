But on 9.9.2010 the 3rd accused Kannabiran only came to the Sub - Registrar Office, Kovilpatti. The complainant asked the 3rd accused [2024] 5 S.C.R. 827 C. Subbiah @ Kadambur Jayaraj and Others v. The Superintendent of Police and Others about the other accused, he replied that he did not know about them and he said the complainant pays the entire amount for 32 cents he is ready to execute the sale deed and therefore the complainant paid the entire amount for 32 cents and after receiving the same on 09.09.2010 the 3rd accused executed a sale deed in respect of his 1/4th undivided share and the same was registered as Doc. No.8124 of 2010 then he left. For the investment amount made by the complainant, he has to get 169 cents, adding the plots to the extent of 32 cents settled by the 3rd accused Kannabiran the complainant has to get in total 201 cents. Out of this Kannabiran has got right to sell his 1/4th undivided share which is equivalent to 103 cents only. The 1st accused C.Subbiah @ Kadambur Jeyaraj can execute the Plots only to an extent of 100 cents to the complainant. But having committed the breach of trust and cheating the complainant without coming to the Sub Registrar Office on 9.9.2010 and keeping the 1 acre without executing in favour of the complainant, he is not only committing a breach of trust but also intimidating the complainant by threatening the complainant continuously with dire consequences that he is having political influence and no one can do anything. 11. Since the 1st Accused expressed his willingness to execute a sale deed in respect of the Property Item No.2 in the Memorandum of Settlement dated 19.10.2010 which is plots situate in Nehru Maha College Road, Malumichampatti Village, Kovai Corporation, if the complainant pays a sum of Rs.41,00,000/- to the 1st Accused. Believing his words the complainant on 14.1.2011 paid a sum of Rs.41,00,000/- to the 1st Accused and completed the sale. And also gave an assurance that they will act in accordance with the Settlement and on the very same date executed an Agreement of Execution. But they have been cheating the complainant without transferring the complainant’s share in the Property Item No.5 as per the settlement dated 19.07.2010. Also it is found in the Memorandum of Settlement dated 19.7.2010 that as for as the Item No.1 concern only the 1st accused has to get the release after paying Rs.31,52,000/- to the Complainant. The 1st accused is cheating even without executing the same. And as per 828 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the Memorandum of Settlement dated 19.7.2010 as for as the 3rd Item is concern they have to divide the property in proportionate to their respective investments. Item No.4 has already been sold by the investors.” 38. It is thus clear that from the complaint, there is no such allegation therein which can persuade the Court to hold that the intention of the accused appellants was to defraud the complainant right from the inception of the transactions.
