15. Another ground on which the charge fails is that, apart from a statement of the complainant that the ‘stridhan’ is with the former in-laws of his daughter, there is nothing on record to substantiate the factum of possession actually being with the appellants. In Bobbili Ramakrishna Raja Yadad & Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh,12 11 [2019] 2 SCR 185 : (2019) 16 SCC 739 12 [2016] 1 SCR 103 : (2016) 3 SCC 309 750 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports this Court has held that giving dowry and traditional presents at the time of the wedding does not raise a presumption that such articles are thereby entrusted to the parents-in-law so as to attract the ingredients of Section 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. 16. As such, insofar as Section 406 IPC is concerned, the instant case would fall under the second factor enumerated in Bhajan Lal (supra), where no cognizable offence is visible on the face of the record. Furthermore, the action being initiated more than 5 years after the divorce of the complainant’s daughter and also 3 years after her second marriage had taken place, demonstrates the same to be hopelessly belated in time. 17. We may further observe that the object of criminal proceedings is to bring a wrongdoer to justice, and it is not a means to get revenge or seek a vendetta against persons with whom the complainant may have a grudge. The principle in law that delay in filing the FIR has to be satisfactorily explained and does not need any reiteration. In the present case, the record is entirely silent on that aspect. It is also to be noted, in the FIR the authorities are requested to take action against the appellant for not returning the gifts given by the complainant to his daughter at the time of the marriage, however, in the charge-sheet such a complaint turns into a demand of dowry and being pressured into incurring expenses for marriage related functions. The question that is to be answered is that when the point of genesis is separate and distinct, how does the end result turn into something that is entirely foreign to the point of genesis? 18. An additional aspect is to be taken note of. The FIR, which culminated in the present proceedings, was lodged in 2021, whereas the matrimonial relations between the complainant’s daughter and her former husband ended in 2015. She subsequently got remarried in 2018. Then, on what grounds does the complaint file the subject FIR in the year 2021, is entirely unexplained. It has been observed in Kishan Singh (Dead) through LRs. v. Gurpal Singh & Ors.13 that: “…. Chagrined and frustrated litigants should not be permitted to give vent by cheaply invoking the jurisdiction of the criminal Court. The Court proceedings ought not to 13 [2010] 10 SCR 16 : (2010) 8 SCC 775 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 751 Mulakala Malleshwara Rao & Anr. v. State of Telangana & Anr. be permitted to degenerate into a weapon of harassment or prosecution.
