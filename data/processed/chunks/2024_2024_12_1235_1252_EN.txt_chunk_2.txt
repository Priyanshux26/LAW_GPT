Tribunal, Principal Bench Delhi1 dated 17.04.2018 whereby it dismissed the original application of the appellants seeking regularization of their services. 3. The appellants before this Court, who were applicants before the Tribunal originally numbered five. However, the fourth applicant before the Tribunal has not approached this Court. Therefore, these appeals are instituted by Applicant Nos.1, 2, 3, and 5 only. The sole Appellant in SLP(C) No. 5580/2024 was applicant no. 2 before the Tribunal whereas the Appellant no. 1, 2 and 3 in SLP(C) No. 11086/ 2024 were Applicant Nos. 1, 3 and 5 respectively before the Tribunal. For ease of reference and to maintain consistency, they shall continue to be referred to by their original applicant numbers as before the Tribunal. 4. The appellants before this Court, being Applicant Nos.1, 2, 3, and 5 before the Tribunal, were originally engaged by the Central Water Commission2 on part-time, ad-hoc terms. Applicant No.1 was appointed as a Safaiwali in 1993, Applicant No.2 as a Safaiwali in 1998, and Applicant No.3 as a Safaiwali in 1999. All three were primarily responsible for cleaning and maintaining the office premises under the CWC. Applicant No.5, appointed in 2004 as a Khallasi (also discharging duties akin to a Mali/Khallasi), was entrusted with tasks such as gardening, dusting, and other ancillary maintenance work. Throughout their engagement, these individuals performed essential housekeeping and support functions at CWC establishments, including its offices at Faridabad, ensuring daily upkeep and contributing to the smooth functioning of the Commission’s administrative operations. 5. Initially, the appellants sought regularization of their services by filing Original Application No.2211/2015 before the Tribunal. They contended that over the years, their roles and responsibilities had evolved beyond the nominal labels of “part-time” or “contractual” and that they were performing ongoing and core functions integral to the CWC’s operations. They relied on applicable government instructions and the principle that long-serving employees, engaged against work of a perennial nature, deserve fair consideration for regularization, 1 Hereinafter referred to as, “the Tribunal” 2 In short, “CWC” 1240 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
