Since the Roadways is considered to be Technical and Industrial Institution, the appellants are covered under Note 3 of Article 350, and they are not entitled for pension. 30. The High Court, under the impugned , has observed that the appellants having received retiral benefits including the benefit under the Employees Provident Fund Scheme, cannot be permitted to turn round and contend that they should also be given pension. We have also considered this aspect of the matter and we approve the observations of the High Court on the principle that a party to the litigation cannot be permitted to approbate and reprobate. See [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1389 U.P. Roadways Retired Officials and Officers Association v. State of U.P. & Anr. National Council of Educational Research and Training vs. Shyam Babu Maheshwari & Ors.,13 Krishna Kumar vs. Union of India14 and Union of India vs. Kailas.15 31. Similarly, in the matter of V.K. Ramamurthy vs. Union of India & Anr.,16 this Court considered the claim for pension of those who opted for pension after a long gap of retirement and held in para 4 that the contributory provident fund retirees form a different class from those who had opted for pension scheme and as such they are not entitled to claim as of right to switch over from Provident Fund Scheme to Pension Scheme. Similar is the proposition in the matter of All India Reserve Bank Retired Officers Association & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Anr.17 32. In somewhat similar situation concerning employees of Oil Natural Gas Commission which was earlier run as a department of the Government of India prior to the enactment of Oil and Natural Gas Commission Act, 1959, this Court in The Committee for Protection of Rights of ONGC Employees & Ors. Vs. Oil and Natural Gas Commission, through its Chairman & Anr.,18 held thus in para 13: “13. This indicates that the scheme of Contributory Provident Fund, by way of retiral benefit, envisaged by the Provident Fund Act, is in the nature of a substitute for old age pension because it was felt that in the prevailing conditions in India, the institution of a pension scheme could not be visualised in the near future. It was not the intention of Parliament that Provident Fund benefit envisaged by the said Act would be in addition to pensionary benefits. Section 12 of the Provident Fund Act seeks to protect the wages of an employee to whom the scheme framed under the said Act applies as well as the total quantum of certain specified benefits to which he is entitled under the terms of his employment. With that end in view, Section 13 [2011] 7 SCR 548 : (2011) 6 SCC 412 14 [1990] 3 SCR 352 : (1990) 4 SCC 207 15 (1998) 9 SCC 721 16 [1996] Supp. 4 SCR 583 : (1996) 10 SCC 73 17 [1991] Supp. 3 SCR 256 : (1992) Supp 1 SCC 664 18 [1990] 2 SCR 156 : (1990) 2 SCC 472 1390 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
