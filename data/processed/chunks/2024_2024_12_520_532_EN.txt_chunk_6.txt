22. From the above, it is clear that the period of deputation is also to be considered while considering such promotion but the question lies in the fact that whether a person, who before coming into effect of Clause 6, stood repatriated to his parent department and was no more in the service of the appellant can take advantage of the said Clause. 23. In the present case, respondent no.1 was initially appointed as Manager (Technical) on deputation by dated 27.05.2008 and worked as such till 13.06.2014. Thereafter, he was repatriated to his parent department namely the Highways & Minor Ports Department, Government of Tamil Nadu. Thus, it is clear that the repatriation of respondent no.1 from 13.06.2014 was back to a Government Department in the State of Tamil Nadu on a full-time basis since it was the parent department of the respondent no.1 and unconnected with the appellant. The respondent no.1 later on joined in the service of the appellant on direct recruitment basis to the post of Manager (Technical) for which he was selected on 26.08.2015 and finally appointed on 02.09.2015 albeit with effect from 26.08.2015. Thus, for all practical purposes, it meant direct and fresh entry on a permanent basis of the respondent no.1 into the appellant. As he had been repatriated to his parent department more than a year prior to such permanent appointment, it cannot be termed ‘absorption’ which finds mention in the aforesaid Clause 6. Thus, respondent no.1 was a fresh and new recruit into the service of the appellant directly to the post of 530 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Manager (Technical). This was totally unrelated/unconnected to his previous service with the NHAI from 27.05.2008 till 13.06.2014 which transaction was complete and reached finality when the respondent no.1 was repatriated to his parent department. 24. The respondent no.1 thus does not stand in the same queue in which the other three persons were, the difference being that the other persons were working with/in the appellant at the relevant point(s) in time. In this view of the matter, there can be no other meaning given to the benefit being extended to persons, who were on deputation service and as such had put in more than four years on such post. The respondent no.1 clearly on 22.05.2017 had not completed 4 years as that in law has to be counted afresh from 26.08.2015 and not from a previous date. This is for the reason that had the respondent no.1 not applied for and taken part in the selection process as a direct recruit, being selected, his claim would not have arisen for any promotion under Clause 6 of the Circular. The persons already working with the appellant on the day of consideration and having completed more than four years of service on the post of Manager (Technical) were only required to be considered. Here, we may clarify that the only object of Clause 6 was to obliterate the difference between a person working on deputation on the post of Manager (Technical) and a person regularly working on the post of Manager (Technical) under the service of the appellant.
