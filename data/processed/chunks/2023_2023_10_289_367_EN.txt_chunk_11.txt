4.6 By way of the Constitution 36th Amendment Act 1975, Sikkim D was made a full-fledged State of India and was included in Entry 22 of Schedule I to the Constitution of India. Article 371-F was also inserted in the Constitution under which it was, inter alia, open to the President or the Parliament to extend any law to the State of Sikkim, or repeal any existing law of Sikkim. E 4.7 On 21.06.1975, the Home Department issued a notification stating that “all Sikkim Subjects (under the Sikkim Subjects Regulations, 1961) before 26.04.1975 were to be deemed Indian citizens”. Therefore, this effaced the distinction between the persons of Indian origin residing in Sikkim (without giving up Indian Citizenship) and others who had taken up Sikkimese Citizenship. F 4.8 Since a large number of eligible persons had been left out of the Sikkim Subject Register and were consequently denied Indian citizenship, Government of Sikkim issued a Memorandum that for the purposes of seeking employment, those claiming to be “Locals” should be able to show whether their parents’ names are maintained on or G before 15.05.1975 in the relevant Government Register. In the year 1980, notification was issued that domicile/ residential certificate issued by sources, other than District Collector, shall not be accepted as valid. 4.9 In the year 1988, a petition was moved in the Lok Sabha by a few MLAs of Sikkim stating that at the time of merger of Sikkim with H 304 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A India, only those people whose names were registered in the Sikkim Subject Register in 1961 were made Indian Citizens, but there were many other stateless persons who were present in Sikkim between the period 1946 and 1975 who were otherwise by the reason of their residence, domicile and allegiance, “Sikkimese”, and they should also be made Indians. The Government of India conceded to this demand and B an exercise was carried out to grant Indian Citizenship to those so-called stateless people who were deemed to have been genuinely omitted. 4.10 In the year 1989, the Sikkim Citizenship (Amendment) 1989 was notified wherein a proviso was created to deem such cases of genuine omission as citizens of India. It appears that the principal C beneficiaries of the said Amendment were those who had migrated to Sikkim post 1946 and were therefore not even eligible for being on the Sikkim Subject Register. 4.11 That thereafter the Government of India formed a Committee consisting of its officers and officers of the Sikkim Government and D certain guidelines were made to decide who the persons were, who were omitted by mistake from being entered into the “Sikkim Subjects Register”. However, these guidelines, did not apply to persons of Indian origin as they were already Indian citizens, but only to those “non- Sikkimese Subjects” who were to be made Indian citizens. E 4.12 Subsequently, vide Government of India’s dated 07.08.1990 and 08.04.1991, a total of 73,431 were granted Indian Citizenship on the basis that it was found that these persons were eligible to have been included in the “Sikkim Subjects Register”.
