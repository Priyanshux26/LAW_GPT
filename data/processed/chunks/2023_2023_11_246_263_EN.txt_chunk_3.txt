Upon committal, charges were framed and the accused including Manoj and Kallu pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 7. Based on the complainant’s testimony, it is established that among the four accused present at the scene during the incident, Suleman, Arif, and Jaihind were duly identifi ed by the complainant, but the fourth accused remained unidentifi ed. During the investigation, it was revealed that the fourth accused was a minor and the case was subsequently referred to the juvenile court for further proceedings. Insofar as Kallu and Manoj are concerned, they were not present at the complainant’s house during the incident and were apprehended at a later stage of the investigation when it was discovered that Manoj had purchased the stolen articles, and Kallu was involved in hatching the conspiracy. 8. After appreciating the oral and documentary evidence on record, the Trial Court convicted and sentenced all the fi ve accused persons as follows: Jaihind and Sections 450, 397, IPC and R.I. for 5 years with a fi ne of Rs 1,000 Arif Section 25(1-B), Arms Act R.I. for 10 years with a fi ne of Rs 5,000 R.I. for 1 year with a fi ne of Rs 1,000 Default: 1 month, 3 months, and 1 month respectively Suleman Sections 450, 397, IPC. R.I. for 5 years with a fi ne of Rs 1,000 R.I. for 10 years with a fi ne of Rs 5,000 Default: 1 month and 3 months, respec- tively Kallu Section 120-B, IPC R.I. for 10 years with a fi ne of Rs 5,000 Default: 3 months Manoj Section 411, IPC R.I. for 3 years with a fi ne of Rs 5,000 Default: 3 months 9. In convicting Manoj, the Trial Court primarily relied on two pieces of evidence: the Seizure Memos, which were prepared upon recovery of the stolen articles from Manoj’s possession, and the Identifi cation Memo, in which the complainant identifi ed the articles stolen. The Trial Court drew presumption under Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (“Evidence Act”, hereafter), to the extent it provides that “a man who is in possession of stolen goods soon after the theft is either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen unless he can account for his possession”. According to the Trial Court, the crucial corroborative evidence in Manoj’s case was the fact that the articles found in his possession belonged to the complainant and were accurately identifi ed by her. Additionally, Manoj failed to provide any explanation regarding how 252 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. the stolen articles came into his possession. These collective factors resulted in his conviction under Section 411, IPC. 10. Insofar as Kallu is concerned, the Trial Court primarily based his conviction for criminal conspiracy on two key factors: fi rst, the information provided by co-accused Jaihind during interrogation in his memorandum statement dated 12th May, 2010, stating that he had given Rs.3,000.00 to Kallu from the stolen money and had kept one country-made pistol along with three cartridges at his (Kallu) house/tapra; and secondly, during interrogation, Kallu himself in his memorandum statement admitted to keeping Rs.3,000.00 in his room’s cupboard, which was subsequently seized upon his disclosure.
