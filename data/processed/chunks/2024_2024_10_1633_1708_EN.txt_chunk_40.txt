Justice M Hidayatullah (as the learned Chief Justice then was), writing for himself and Justice Raghubar Dayal, observed that the substituted provision was meant to enable the reassessment of income which had escaped assessment for past periods. It was further observed that the substituted provision “meant to operate retrospectively eight years in some cases and four years in others.”118 Justice A K Sarkar (as the learned Chief Justice then was) also observed that no notice could be issued under the 1948 amendment “for a year from the end of which eight years had expired.”119 60. The above principles can be applied as follows to the factual situation in the present appeals: (i) The Finance Act 2021 substituted Sections 147 to 151 of the Income Tax Act with effect from 1 April 2021; (ii) Sections 147 to 151 of the old law ceased to operate from 1 April 2021; (iii) After 1 April 2021, any reference to the Income Tax Act means the Income Tax Act as amended by the Finance Act 2021; (iv) The time limits prescribed for issuing reassessment notices under Section 149operate retrospectively for three years for all situations and six years in case the escaped assessment amounts to or is likely to amount to more than Rupees fifty lakhs. 61. TOLA is a legislation enacted by Parliament. The assesses have neither challenged the legislative competence of Parliament to enact TOLA nor have they challenged the vires of the legislation. Section 3(1) of TOLA provides for the relaxation of “any time limit” prescribed under the specified Acts for completion or compliance of “any proceeding or passing of any or issuance of any sanction, intimation, notification, sanction, or approval.” The expression “any” has been interpreted by this Court to mean “all” or “every”.120 The context in which the word “any” appears has to be construed after taking into consideration the scheme and the purpose of the enactment.121 118 S C Prashar (supra) 107 119 S C Prashar (supra) 86 120 LDA v. M K Gupta (1994) 1 SCC 243 [4]; Raj Kumar Shivhare v. Directorate of Enforcement (2010) 4 SCC 772 [24]; 121 Vivek Narayan Sharma v. Union of India (2023) 3 SCC 1 [132] 1684 [2024] 10 S.C.R.

The purpose of Section 3(1) of TOLA is to provide relaxation of time limits prescribed under the specified Acts, which fell for completion or compliance from 20 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. TOLA was enacted in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impeded the functioning of the government at all levels. The imposition of national and local lockdowns created difficulties for the common people, including litigants and assesses, to comply with their legal obligations. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns required legislatures across the world to dynamically adapt their laws and policies to redress the difficulties faced by persons, entities, and governmental authorities.122 The World Bank identified that persons and business entities faced severe financial situations characterised by a lack of cash or easily convertible-to-cash assets.
