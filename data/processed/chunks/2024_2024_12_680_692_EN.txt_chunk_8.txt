We must remember that when we sit in constitutional courts, even we are prone to making mistakes. Therefore, personal criticism of Judges or recording findings on the conduct of Judges in s must be avoided.” (emphasis supplied) 18. The High Court ought to have shown restraint. The High Court cannot damage the career of a judicial officer by passing such s. The reason is that he cannot defend himself when such s are passed on the judicial side. 19. Hence, we pass the following : i. All adverse remarks/observations in the impugned dated 5th May 2023 made against the appellant, stand expunged. The findings contained in paragraph 11 of the impugned holding that the appellant has indulged in disobedience of judicial instructions and indiscipline are set aside and the direction to place the case before the Chief Justice is also set aside; ii. The observations made against the appellant in s dated 4th April 2023, 25th April 2023 and directions issued thereunder 692 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports to the appellant are set aside. We clarify that in view of what we have held earlier, the adverse remarks and observations made against the appellant in the aforesaid s cannot be the basis for taking any action against the appellant on the administrative side; iii. A copy of this shall be forwarded to the Registrar General of the High Court of Rajasthan who shall place the same before the Hon’ble Chief Justice of the said Court on administrative side. iv. Appeal is allowed on the above terms. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
