The High Court found that the Civil Appeals were required to be decided on the basis of the preponderance of probabilities. The High Court found that the complainant had established that he was working as a LIC Agent, that his father was owning extensive agricultural properties and that he F was deriving agricultural income. The High Court, on the basis of the evidence placed on record, relying on the preponderance of probability, came to a conclusion that the plaintiff had the financial ability to lend the sum of Rs.3 lakh as on 20th October 1998. The High Court also found that the appellant’s wife was not examined as a witness in the said case G so as to probabilize the defence plea. The High Court found that the best available evidence was withheld by the defendants/appellants herein and as such, the principle of adverse inference was also applicable. 30. Though it was sought to be argued before the High Court that in view of the in the criminal proceedings, the suit(s) was also liable to be dismissed, the High Court rightly observed that the adjudication H 822 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A in civil matters is based on preponderance of probabilities whereas adjudication in criminal cases is based on the principle that the accused is presumed to be innocent and the guilt of the accused should be proved to the hilt and the proof should be beyond all reasonable doubt. 31. We, therefore, find no reason to interfere with the s and s passed by the High Court in the Civil Appeals. However, in B the facts and circumstances of the case, we are inclined to modify the decree. During the pendency of the proceedings before this Court, the appellants have deposited an amount of Rs.7 lakh and Rs. 2 lakh pursuant to the s of this Court dated 20th February, 2009 passed in Criminal Appeal No. 1978 of 2013 (arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) C No.1456 of 2009 and connected matter and dated 13th August, 2012 passed in Civil Appeal No.10501 of 2013 (arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.23036 of 2012). The said amount has been directed to be invested in a Fixed Deposit Receipts from time to time. We are, therefore, of the view that, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the decree needs to be modified restricting it to the amount already D deposited by the appellants in both the proceedings with interest accrued thereon. 32. In the result, we pass the following : (i) Criminal Appeal Nos. 1978 of 2013 and 1990 of 2013 are allowed and the common of conviction dated 28th E October 2008 and of sentence dated 30th October 2008 respectively are quashed and set aside. The s and s dated 10th July 2011 passed by the learned Trial Court is confirmed. (ii) Civil Appeal Nos. 10500 of 2013 and 10501 of 2013 are dismissed. However, the decrees of the High Court are F modified, thereby restricting them to the amount already deposited by the appellants in this Court in the civil and criminal proceedings, along with interest accrued thereon.
