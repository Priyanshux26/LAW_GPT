17 crores and which is being used for public purpose. The submissions on behalf of the original writ petitioners is that leaving aside the land which is already used for the sewage lines, the remaining land be released cannot be accepted. The part land cannot be released and/or with respect C to the part land, the acquisition cannot be quashed. It is required to be noted that in the present case the acquisition has been completed including acquiring the land, passing the award and payment of compensation and the land in question is vested in the State Government free from all encumbrances. Under the circumstances, the impugned and passed by the High Court in CWP No. 10452/2014 is unsustainable D and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside. 5.5 Similarly, so far as the Civil Appeal arising out CWP No. 6729/ 2013 is concerned, the representation of the original writ petitioners to release the land from acquisition is rejected on the ground that the land is required for widening of the road. Having gone through the map, we E are of the opinion that when the land in question is required by the State for widening of the road and when the entire acquisition proceedings have been concluded including declaration of the award, passing of the award and the payment of the compensation, the acquisition with respect to the said land which is required for widening of the road ought not to F have been quashed and/or the same land was not required to be released. The State was absolutely justified in not releasing the said land which as such is required for the widening of the road. Under the circumstances, the impugned and passed by the High Court in CWP No. 6729/2013 deserves to be quashed and set aside. G 6. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 11843/2022 arising out of the impugned and passed in CWP No. 16346/2013 is hereby dismissed with the above observations. 7.
