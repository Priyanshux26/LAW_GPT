Power of review should not be confused with appellate powers as the appellate power can correct all manners of errors committed by the subordinate courts. The following s G may be referred: (1) Shivdeo Singh Vs. State of Punjab; AIR 1963 SC 1909 5 (1997) 8 SCC 715 H 738 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A (2) Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma Vs. Aribam Pishak Sharma; AIR 1979 SC 1047 (3) Meera Bhanja (Smt.) Vs. Nirmala Kumari Choudhary (Smt. ); (1995) 1 SCC 170. (4) Uma Nath Pandey Vs. State of U.P. ; (2009) 12 SCC B 40 13. Recently, this Court in a dated 24th February, 2023 passed in Civil Appeal No.1167-1170 of 2023 between S. Murali Sundaram Vs. Jothibai Kannan and Others, observed that even though a sought to be reviewed is erroneous, the same cannot C be a ground to review in exercise of powers under XLVII Rule 1 CPC. Futher, in the case of Perry Kansagra Vs. Smriti Madan Kansagra6, this Court observed that while exercising the review jurisdiction in an application under XLVII Rule 1 read with Section 114 CPC, the Review Court does not sit in appeal over its own . D 14. In another case between Shanti Conductors (P) Ltd. Vs. Assam SEB,7 this Court observed that scope of review under XLVII Rule 1 read with Section 114 CPC is limited and under the guise of review, the petitioner cannot be permitted to reagitate and reargue questions which have already been addressed and decided. It was further observed that an error which is not self-evident and has to be detected E by a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of record. 15. From the above, it is evident that a power to review cannot be exercised as an appellate power and has to be strictly confined to the scope and ambit of XLVII Rule 1 CPC. An error on the face of F record must be such an error which, mere looking at the record should strike and it should not require any long-drawn process of reasoning on the points where there may conceivably be two opinions. 16. In the above backdrop of the scope of review to which these petitions are confined, we proceed to consider whether a case for review G is made out or not. 17. As many as 18 grounds have been raised in the review petitions, we have considered not only the oral submissions advanced by Mr. Salve, 6 (2019) 20 SCC 753 H 7 (2020) 2 SCC 677 ARUN DEV UPADHYAYA v. INTEGRATED SALES SERVICE 739 LTD. & ANR. [VIKRAM NATH, J.] learned Sr. Counsel, but have also perused all the grounds raised in the A review petition. A close perusal of the dated 10.08.2021 reflects that all the grounds taken in the review have been discussed in detail and findings returned not accepting the claim of the Review Petitioner. What is sought to be argued is basically that the view taken is erroneous and therefore, impugned deserves to be reviewed.
