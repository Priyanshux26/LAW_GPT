It is submitted that, in any case, clause 3.5.12 of the RFP enables the procurer to reject any bid where the quoted tariff is not aligned to market prices. 14. Shri Chidambaram further submits that the directions issued by this Court vide dated 25th April 2018, were specifically restricted to L-1 to L-5 bidders, which were litigating. It is submitted that the contention of the respondent No.1-MB Power that the of this Court dated 25th April 2018 was an in rem is erroneous. 15. Relying on the of this Court in the case of R. Viswanathan and others v. Rukn-ul-Mulk Syed Abdul Wajid since deceased and others2, Shri Chidambaram submits that the in rem settles the destiny of the res itself. Whereas an in personam determines the rights of persons before the Court and binds only 2 (1963) 3 SCR 22=AIR 1963 SC 1=1962 INSC 205 928 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the parties to the lis. Reliance in this respect is also placed on the of this Court in the case of Deccan Paper Mills Company Limited v. Regency Mahavir Properties & Ors.3 16. Shri Chidambaram further submits that the reliance by the respondents on the certificate, which certified the bid evaluation process was carried out in conformity with the provisions of the RFP, and, therefore, it is not permissible to go into the determination of tariff is incorrect. He submits that the certificate is not certifying that L-7 was qualified to be selected as a “successful bidder” or it had earned a right to have his bid accepted irrespective of the quoted tariff. He submits that if the quoted tariff of L-4 bidder of Rs.5.143 and L-5 bidder of Rs.5.300 were misaligned, then, most certainly, the quoted tariff of L-7 bidder of Rs.5.517 was also misaligned. 17. The learned Senior Counsel submits that the jurisdiction under Section 63 of the Electricity Act is not that of a mere post office. The State Commission has a power to reject the adoption of tariff if it is not aligned to market prices. In this respect, he refers to the s of this Court in the cases of Tata Power Company Limited Transmission v. Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission & Ors.4 and Energy Watchdog v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and others5. 18. Shri Chidambaram submits that the State Commission while adopting the tariff is bound to take into consideration the protection of consumer interest. Reliance in this respect has been placed on the of this Court in the case of GMR Warora Energy Limited v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) & Ors.6, wherein this Court has emphasized the need for balancing the interest of the consumers with that of the generators. 19. Shri Chidambaram further submits that in view of clauses 2.15.1 and 3.5.12 of the RFP and clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines, the appellants had the power to reject all price bids if the rates quoted are not aligned to the prevailing market prices. 3 [2021] 13 SCR 786 : (2021) 4 SCC 786=2020 INSC 497 4 [2022] 19 SCR 620 : 2022 SCC Online 1615=2022 INSC 1220 5 [2017] 3 SCR 153 : (2017) 14 SCC 80=2017 INSC 338 6 [2023] 8 SCR 183 : 2023 SCC Online SC 464=2023 INSC 398 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
