Having bestowed serious consideration to the rival contentions, we feel that the High Court’s decision to condone the delay on account of the fi rst respondent’s inability to present the appeal within time, for the reasons assigned therein, does not suff er from any error warranting interference. As the aforementioned s have shown, such an exercise of discretion does, at times, call for a liberal and justice-oriented approach by the Courts, where certain leeway could be provided to the State. The hidden forces that are at work in preventing an appeal by the State being presented within the prescribed period of limitation so as not to allow a higher court to pronounce upon the legality and validity of an of a lower court and thereby secure unholy gains, can hardly be ignored. Impediments in the working of the grand scheme of governmental functions have to be removed by taking a pragmatic view on balancing of the competing interests. 760 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. CONCLUSION 38. For the foregoing reasons and the special circumstances obtaining here that the impugned reasonably condones the delay caused in presenting the appeal by the fi rst respondent before the High Court, the present appeal is, accordingly, dismissed. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of. 39. Parties shall bear their own costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal dismissed. Nidhi Jain
