During proceedings concerning the validity of the 1955 Act before this Court, the High Court of Andhra Pradesh Act invalidated the entirety of the 1967 legislation. Before this Court, a question arose that as the 1967 statute had repealed the 1955 law, and the 1967 statute itself had been struck down, whether the 1955 was now in force. Justice P Jaganmohan Reddy, speaking for a two-Judge Bench of this Court observed: “10. On the main question whether the impugned Acts were revived by reason of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh striking down Act 9 of 1967, a perusal of that would show that the Division Bench considered the question and held that as the inam lands had already vested in the Government on July 20, 1955, there was no need to abolish inams which already stood abolished long before the date when the impugned Act, namely, Act 9 of 1967, was enacted.” 72 [1975] 1 SCR 429 : (1974) 2 SCC 376 : 1974 INSC 118 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 87 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. The learned Judge quoted the of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh where the High Court had held: “The effect of the impugned Act in pith and substance is really not agrarian reform but to destroy the rights of the inamdars and others who were assured compensation under the repealed Act.” Based on this finding of the High Court, Justice Jaganmohan Reddy concluded: “10. … The striking down of Act 9 of 1967 must be construed in the light of the reasoning given by the learned Judges of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court that the Abolition Act 8 of 1955 and the Amendment Act 10 of 1956 had already achieved the result which Act 9 of 1967 was intended to achieve, and once the inams had already vested in the Government, compensation had to be paid in accordance with the terms of those laws and cannot again be re-opened by vesting the inams which had already vested as if they had not already vested in the Government. This postulates the existence of the Acts impugned before us as a ground for striking down Act 9 of 1967, so that when the High Court says that the latter Act 9 of 1967is void it could not have intended to say that even the Acts now impugned before us did not revive.” This Court in Shaukat Khan observed that the High Court of Andhra Pradesh had invalidated the 1967 statute precisely on the ground that the inams had already vested in the state government under the 1955 law and the regime of compensation could not subsequently be altered by the 1967 statute. This reasoning presupposes the existence of the 1955 laws being in force. The High Court could not invalidate the 1967 law but also simultaneously enforced the repeal of the 1955 statute which it had expressly stated would govern compensation. Thus, where a court assesses whether a law revives or not after an amendment or subsequent enactment is invalidated, the court must assess both the totality of the legislative circumstances but also the logical consequences that flow from the decision to invalidate the statute or provision in question.
