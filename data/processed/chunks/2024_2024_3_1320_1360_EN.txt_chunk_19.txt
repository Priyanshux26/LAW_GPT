v. Argentina (dec.), 22 September 2021, CRC/ C/88/D/104/2019. 1348 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the Child49 alleging violations of their rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child50 by Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey. The communication asserted that these nations had not reduced their greenhouse gas emissions to an adequate level and that they had failed to curb carbon pollution. Although the CRC found that the communication was inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, it affirmed that States exercise effective control over carbon emissions and bear responsibility for transboundary harm arising from such emissions. Notably, it observed that while climate change necessitates a global response, individual states retain accountability for their actions or inactions concerning climate change and their contribution to its effects. 49. In Ioane Teitiota v. The Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment,51 the appellant travelled to New Zealand from Kiribati, a small island country in the Pacific Ocean, and remained there after his permit expired. He later applied for refugee status and / or protected person status on the ground that sea levels in Kiribati were rising due to climate change. He anticipated being forced to leave Kiribati in the future due to this. The relevant authorities rejected his application and the concerned tribunal dismissed the appeal. The appellant sought leave to appeal the decision of the tribunal, which was rejected by two appellate courts. Finally, the Supreme Court of New Zealand dismissed his application for leave to appeal. It held that the appellant would not face serious harm if he returned to Kiribati and that there was “no evidence that the Government of Kiribati [was] failing to take steps to protect its citizens from the effects of environmental degradation.” Significantly, it also held that its decision in this case would not rule out the possibility of a similar application succeeding in an appropriate case in the future. 50. These cases, all instituted and decided in the past decade, indicate the type of concerns which will travel to the courts in the next few years. 49 “CRC” 50 “UNCRC” 51 [2015] NZSC 107.
