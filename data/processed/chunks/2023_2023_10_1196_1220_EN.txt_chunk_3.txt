In the course of his submission, Mr. Nagamuthu drew our A attention to the of this Court in the case of Jogendra Yadav and Ors. vs. State of Bihar and Anr., reported in (2015) 9 SCC 244. Therein, he pointed out that this Court has found that since a person who is added under Section 319 Cr.P.C. is necessarily heard before he was so added and often gets a further B hearing if he challenges the summoning he cannot avail the remedy of discharge. This Court may not have been inclined to interfere with the impugned but would have been inclined to reserve the remedy of seeking discharge, if so advised at the appropriate stage.
