Another writ petition to the same effect was preferred by A.Annamalai and 13 others. It was contended that the Commissioner of Land Revenue had dismissed the revision against the of the Director of Survey and Settlement without affording proper opportunity of hearing to them. The said writ petitions were dismissed whereupon the appellant Committee F filed writ appeals which were allowed on 08.07.1999 and the matter was remitted to the Government to rehear it and to redecide it within three months. 19. Consequent to the above directions, the matter was reconsidered at the level of the Government and G.O.Ms.No.676 dated G 23.12.1999 was issued observing that since the “suit land” vests in the Government, it is open for it to grant permission to the claimant respondents under Section 19A of the Abolition Act to remain in possession of the same. 20. The appellant Committee again preferred writ petition H challenging the above G.O.Ms.No.676 dated 23.12.1999 by filing a fresh SALEM MUSLIM BURIAL GROUND PROTECTION 395 COMMITTEE v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU [PANKAJ MITHAL, J.] writ petition No.5985 of 2000. The writ petition was allowed vide A dated 29.04.2005 on two counts: (i) that the “suit land” is notified to be a wakf property and as such it cannot be alienated in exercise of powers under Section 19A of the Abolition Act; and (ii) even if Section 19A is exercised no rights could be conferred upon the claimants respondents in the absence of any material to show that they were put in possession B by the land holders. 21. The claimant respondents, aggrieved by the aforesaid and of the writ court filed writ appeal Nos.1327 and 1348 of 2005 respectively which has been allowed by the impugned and dated 06.08.2009, after setting aside the of the writ court, C holding that OTS 2253 is registered as a muslim burial ground which has been handed over to the Wakf Board whereas the “suit land” (OTS 2210 now T.S. Nos. 113 and 70) is merely recorded as a rudra bhumi with no sign of muslim burial and as such has rightly not been held to be a wakf property in the dated 31.01.1975 of the Director of Survey and Settlement. There is no material on record to establish any dedication D of the suit land as a wakf property and that the notification dated 29.04.1959 regarding the “suit land” as a wakf is unacceptable; first for the reason that the said notification was not pressed by the appellant Committee till 1999 before any authority in any case; and secondly, for reason that no evidence was brought on record to establish that any E preliminary survey as contemplated under Section 4 of the Wakf Act, 1954 was conducted before issuing the said notification under Section 5 of the Wakf Act. 22. It is in the above background that these appeals have been preferred and have come up for consideration before us. F 23. We had heard Mrs. June Chaudhari, learned senior counsel for the appellant Committee and Shri Narendra Kumar and Ms. N.S.
