is meant to encourage establishment D andrunning of industrial units only. Since petitioners areclaiming benefit of the above extracted G.O. andsince they also obtained permission from the Court toclean and over haul the machinery, it is clear that thesale deed in question covers not only Land, Buildingsand Civil works but plant and machinery also.” E 13. The Court relied on Duncans Industries Limited v. State of Uttar Pradesh and others1 and found that since the property covered by the sale deed covered not only the land, buildings and civil works, but plant and machinery also, the value of the plant and machinery also had to be considered for payment of stamp duty. The learned Single Judge found that the value of the current assets had to be reduced. Still further F he found that since the first respondent was an industry and wanted to run the unit as an industry, the benefit of GOMS 103 Revenue (Registration) Department dated 07.02.2001 could be extended to it. Writ Petition No. 10101 of 2004 came to be dismissed with costs. Writ Petition No. 19900 of 2004 was allowed in part and the matter was G remitted to the second appellant to determine the current assets and to deduct their value from Rs.8.35 crores and to reckon the remaining value as the value of the land, buildings, civil works, plant and machinery and collect stamp duty and penalty, if any, by extending the benefit of GOMS 103 dated 07.02.2001. H 1 (2000) 1 SCC 633 THE SUB REGISTRAR, AMUDALAVALASA & ANR. v. M/S 1117 DANKUNI STEELS LTD. & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] 14.

One of the appeals was filed by the Respondents 1 and 2, viz., Writ Appeal No. 1873 whereas Writ Appeal No.2457 of 2005 was filed by the appellants. Both the Appeals were directed against the in Writ Petition No.19900 of 2004. The short reasoning which appealed to the Division Bench and the relief B granted was as follows: “When we asked the learned Government Pleader as to how the petitioner could be forced to register even the plant and machinery when they only seek registration of the land and buildings, Learned Government Pleader would submit that the value of the land and C buildings would be required to be determined by the Sub-Registrar; and the petitioner’s claim that its value was only Rs.1,01,05,000/- could not be accepted. As the petitioner only seeks registration of land and buildings, and would run the risk of the plant and machinery not being registered, the Sub-Registrar cann0t force them to pay stamp duty on the value of plant and machinery when they do not D seek its registration. The question whether the value of these lands and buildings, on the date of presentation of the document, was Rs.1,01,05,000/- or not is a matter which the Sub-Registrar is required to consider; and it is on the value of the land and buildings, as determined by.
