After the Scheduled Off ence went through an elongated judicial journey, it is the turn of the Enforcement Case Information Report under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as “the PMLA, 2002”).

Though arguments at length are made at the Bar, the principal issue is only on the remand in favour of the investigating agency, without seeking any specifi c prayer challenging the remand s, though additional grounds were raised. 3. Heard Shri Kapil Sibal and Shri Mukul Rohatgi learned Senior Advocates appearing for the appellant and Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appearing for the respondents.

Petition (Criminal) Nos. 7437 of 2023, 7460 of 2023, and 8750 of 2023, are appositely referred as respondents. 5. The appellant is a Cabinet Minister of the State of Tamil Nadu.
