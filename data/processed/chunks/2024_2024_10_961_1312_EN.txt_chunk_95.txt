Since the cut-off dates in Section 6A have been found not to offend the aforementioned principles, we are not inclined to interfere in the prescription of such cut-off dates. 234. We may hasten to add here that Section 6A does not operate perpetually and since it does not rescue those immigrants who entered the State of Assam on or after 25.03.1971 and has become redundant qua them, the cut-off dates prescribed therein cannot be said to be tainted with the element of manifest arbitrariness. (f) Process prescribed under Section 6A 235. The Petitioners also claimed that the process as prescribed under Section 6A is also manifestly arbitrary. Let us now proceed to consider whether the process in built in Section 6A suffers with the vice of manifest arbitrariness, regardless of the number of conditions prescribed therein for claiming citizenship. 1098 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 236. The conditions for an individual who migrated prior to 01.01.1966 are such that first, the person must be of Indian origin; second, they should have migrated to Assam from the specified territory before 01.01.1966; and third, the person must have been ordinarily resident in Assam since the date of their entry into Assam. Additionally, the persons whose names were included in the electoral rolls for the 1967 elections were also to be conferred deemed citizenship. Section 6A(1) further defines the meaning of the terms contained in Section 6A(2). Section 6A(1) (a) explains ‘Assam’ to mean “territories included in the State of Assam immediately before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1985”. Section 6A(1) (c) defines ‘specified territory’ to mean “territories included in Bangladesh immediately before the commencement of the Citizenship Act, 1985”. Further, the person is deemed to be of ‘Indian origin’, as per Section 6A(1) (d), if “he, or either of his parents or any of his grandparents was born in undivided India”. The meaning of ‘ordinarily resident in Assam’ is also clear and has been discussed in the succeeding paragraphs. Hence, conferring deemed citizenship under Section 6A(2) is not arbitrary but subject to the abovementioned conditions. 237. Further, the migrants who came to Assam on or after 01.01.1966 and before 25.03.1971, will have to be subjected to the following conditions and processes, in addition to the conditions stipulated above: i. Such persons should have been detected to be foreigners. Section 6A(1) (e) makes it clear that a person is deemed to have been a foreigner on the date on which a Tribunal constituted under the Foreigners (Tribunals) , 1964 submits its opinion to the effect that he is a foreigner to the officer or authority concerned. ii. Such persons, thereafter, should register themselves in accordance with the provisions of the Citizenship Rules, 2009, with a registering authority as specified therein. Rule 19 of the Citizenship Rules, 2009 deals with the Registering Authority, who would be an officer not below the rank of the Additional District Magistrate. iii. Thereafter, per Rule 19(2), an application for registration under Form XVIII would have to be made by the persons so detected by the Tribunals, before the Registering Authority within 30 days [2024] 10 S.C.R.
