2. From the impugned and passed by the High E Court and from the counter affidavit filed by the Govt. of Delhi through LAC before the High Court, it appears that it was the specific case on behalf of the LAC that the physical possession of the property/land bearing Khasra Nos. 17/1/1 min (1-18), 10/20/2/1 (2-0), 21/1 (1-18) was duly taken over by the Government on 29.01.2010. However, remaining F 3 biswa land comprised in Khasra No. 17/1/1 was not taken over due to built- up. Despite the above and thereafter following the earlier decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. Vs. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki and Ors., (2014) 3 SCC 183, on the ground that the compensation with respect to the lands in question is not paid/tendered to the land owners, the High Court has allowed the G writ petition and has declared that the entire acquisition with respect to the land measuring 3 bighas and 18 biswas in Khasra Nos. 10/20/2/1 (2- 00) and 21/1 (1-18) and 17/1 (1-9) and land measuring 1 bigha and 9 biswas in Khasra No. 17/1/1 (2-01) is deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013. H DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. AMIT JAIN & ORS. 93 [M. R. SHAH, J.] 3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ A petitioners disputed the actual taking over of possession and submitted that the possession was taken over by drawing proceedings. However, as observed and held by this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and Ors., (2020) 8 SCC 129 taking over the physical possession by drawing the punchnama/possession B proceedings can be said to be sufficient compliance. Therefore, except the remaining 3 biswa land comprised in Khasra No. 17/1/1 which was not taken over due to built-up, the possession of the other lands in question were taken by the Government on 29.01.2010. Under the circumstances, the acquisition with respect to the entire lands in question could not have been declared as deemed lapse under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013. C 4. In the case of Indore Development Authority (supra) in paragraph 366, the Constitution Bench of this Court has observed and held as under:- “366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the D questions as under: 366.1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on 1-1-2014, the date of commencement of the 2013 Act, there is no lapse of proceedings. Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of the 2013 Act. E 366.2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding the period covered by an interim of the court, then proceedings shall continue as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the 2013 Act under the 1894 Act as if it has not been repealed. F 366.3. The word “or” used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be read as “nor” or as “and”.
