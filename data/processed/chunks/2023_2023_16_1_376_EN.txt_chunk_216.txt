IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 309 [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] Yours sincerely, Sd/- Mountbatten of Burma” 18. Now turning to the preparation of the fi rst draft of the Indian Constitution, which was handed over by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on behalf of the Drafting Committee as its Chairman to the Constituent Assembly President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad on 21.2.1948.49 There was no equivalent of Article 370 in that draft Constitution. During this period, the Jammu & Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan was being tabled at the United Nations.50 The insertion of Article 306-A (the equivalent of Article 370) took place during the Constituent Assembly Debates and was introduced on 17.10.1949. Article 306-A was drafted by Gopalaswami Ayyangar, in close consultation with Sheikh Abdullah, the content being a result of negotiations between the Centre and the Government of Jammu and Kashmir, from May to October, 1949.51 The Constituent Assembly Debates refer to the peculiar position of Jammu & Kashmir as inter alia enunciated by Shri N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar. What was said was that an interim system had to be established through Article 306-A till a Constituent Assembly for the State of Jammu & Kashmir came into being. Article 306-A reads as under: “306-A. (1) Not withstanding anything contained in this Constitution.
