17. Before we delve into the arguments presented by the counsels for the parties before us, it is imperative that we also look at the observations made by the High Court with respect to the two s heavily relied upon by the parties before it as well as before us. 4 AIR 1936 Privy Council 253 5 [2001] Supp. 4 SCR 323 : (2002) 1 SCC 367 6 [2022] 6 SCR 860 : (2022) 9 SCC 23 1220 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 18. The High Court while addressing the reliance placed upon Aneeta Hada v. Godfather Travels and Tours Pvt. Ltd.7 and N. Harihara Krishnan v. J. Thomas,8 observed that while Aneeta Hada (supra) underscored the necessity of involving the company as an accused to maintain a prosecution under Section 141 NI Act, N. Harihara Krishnan (supra) clarified that an authorized signatory is not considered the “drawer” under Section 138 of the NI Act. These s guided the High Court in interpreting provisions of the NI Act regarding vicarious liability and the definition of the term “drawer” within the statutory framework. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT 19. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that if a director, managing director, chairman, promotor of a company can be arrayed as accused under Section 141, NI Act despite not being a signatory to the cheque, then it is only fair that one or more of such individuals be held liable to pay interim compensation. 20. Relying upon the object of Section 143-A, NI Act, it was submitted that for addressing the issue of undue delay and for providing relief to the payees of dishonoured cheque, it is only just and fair that this be done through payment of interim compensation by the director or any such person in charge of the company. This would be in alignment with the purposes and objectives of the provision. 21. Further, it was argued that in the present case the company is admitted to CIRP, thus being its alter ego, it is only the directors who can be directed to pay interim compensation in furtherance of the object of the provision in light of the CIRP proceedings against the company, the payees of the dishonoured cheque cannot be left with no interim relief, thereby defeating the purpose of Section 143-A and causing injustice to the payees already suffering due to the pending litigation. 22. Learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that any restrictive interpretation of the provision would defeat the purpose of providing interim compensation to the payee of a dishonoured cheque. To further strengthen their argument, they relied upon this Court’s 7 [2012] 5 SCR 503 : (2012) 5 SCC 661 8 [2017] 9 SCR 324 : (2018) 13 SCC 663 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1221 Shri Gurudatta Sugars Marketing Pvt. Ltd. v. Prithviraj Sayajirao Deshmukh & Ors. in Aneeta Hada (Supra)9 and submitted that in para 20 of the , this Court has observed that an authorised signatory of a company becomes a drawer as he has been authorised to do so in respect of the account maintained by the company.
