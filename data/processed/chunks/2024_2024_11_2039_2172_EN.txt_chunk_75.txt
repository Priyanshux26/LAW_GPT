2147 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. nor the dated 18.01.2024 can be read to mean that non-compliance of the direction to deposit INR 150 crores by the SRA by 31.01.2024 should lead to liquidation of the Corporate Debtor. The submission of the Appellant that non- deposit of INR 150 crores leads to failure of Resolution Plan, cannot be accepted. As observed above, consequence of non-deposit of INR 150 crores is that these Appeals have to be heard on merits and the question, which has arisen in the Appeal has to be decided regarding compliance of conditions precedent by the SRA by 20.05.2022. Further submission of the Appellant that this Tribunal may exercise jurisdiction under Section 33, sub-section (3) in directing liquidation of the Corporate Debtor due to non- compliance of deposit on INR 150 crores also cannot be accepted. For passing an under Section 33, sub- section (3), there has to be adjudication that Resolution Plan approved by the Adjudicating Authority has been contravened by the Successful Resolution Applicant. We do not accept the submission of the Appellant that by non-deposit of INR 150 crores by 31.01.2024, the SRA has contravened the Resolution Plan and be passed under Section 33, sub-section (3). In view of our above observations and conclusions, we answer Question Nos. v, vi, and vii in following manner: Question No. v: Direction of Hon’ble Supreme Court permitting the Successful Resolution Applicant to infuse INR 150 crores by 31.01.2024 was in reference to offer made by Appellant in affidavit dated 16.08.2023 Question No. iv: The Successful Resolution Applicant having not been able to infuse funds by 31.01.2024 as directed by Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its dated 18.01.2024, it cannot be held that Resolution Plan has failed and cannot be implemented by the SRA. 2148 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Question No. vii: No grounds have been made out to direct the liquidation of the Corporate Debtor under Section 33, sub-section (3) in these Appeals.” (emphasis supplied) 142. The NCLAT declined to accept the submission of the Appellant that on account of non-deposit of Rs. 150 Crore as directed by this Court, the Corporate Debtor should be liquidated. However, this was based on the incorrect assumption that the direction of this Court to infuse to Rs. 150 Crore in cash was only confined to the terms of the Lenders Affidavit dated 16.08.2023. Previous segments of the have elaborated in sufficient detail that the Lender’s Affidavit could not have provided for conditions which were incompatible with the terms of the Resolution Plan. Such an affidavit would have been in direct contravention with Section 31(1) of the IBC, 2016 which does not permit any modifications to be made in the Resolution Plan duly approved by the Adjudicating Authority. Therefore, the direction of this Court in its dated 18.01.2024 was with respect to both the Lenders Affidavit and the underlying terms of the Resolution Plan. The same was so understood by all the parties involved.
