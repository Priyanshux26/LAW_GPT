[2024] 12 S.C.R. 993 : 2024 INSC 980 Urban Improvement Trust v. Smt. Vidhya Devi and Ors. (Civil Appeal No. 14473 of 2024) 13 December 2024 [J.B. Pardiwala* and Manoj Misra, JJ.] Issue for Consideration The present appeals arise from a common passed by the High Court dated 29.10.2009, whereby the High Court allowed the writ appeals and thereby quashed the land acquisition proceedings initiated by the appellant Trust. Headnotes† Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act, 1959 – s.52(2), s.52(7), s.60A – Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – Condonation of delay in filing writ petition – The appellant challenges the inordinate delay of 21 years in filing writ petition by the respondent, whether the same needs to be considered in the facts and circumstances of the case: Held: The courts have consistently held that undue delay in approaching the court can be a ground for refusing relief, the courts have also recognized that in exceptional cases, where the impugned action is patently illegal or affects fundamental rights, the delay must be condoned – The right of an individual to vindicate and protect private property cannot be brushed away merely on the grounds of delay and laches – In the instant case, there are three instances of procedural irregularity that may prejudice the rights of the respondents herein: (1) the notice under Section 52(2) of the RUI Act was not served individually to the landowners and the same was not pasted at a conspicuous area of the locality where the property was situated; (2) the possession was allegedly taken by the State Government and handed over to the appellant Trust prior to the deposit of compensation in contravention to Section 52(7) of the RUI Act; and (3) the compensation in respect of the Nangli Kota lands was not paid in terms of the timelines * Author 994 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports stipulated in sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 60A of the RUI Act – These procedural anomalies are glaring and necessitate discussion regarding the propriety of the acquisition proceedings so as to ensure that the landowners are not dispossessed of their property without following due procedure – Therefore, the writ petition filed before the High Court, despite the significant delay, raised substantial questions regarding the legality of the land acquisition proceedings – The alleged patent illegality in the acquisition process justify the condonation of delay in this exceptional case. [Paras 46, 51, 52, 53, 54] Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act, 1959 – s.52(1) – Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – Notification for acquisition u/s.52(1) of RUI Act – Publication of Notice: Held: The provisions of the Section 52(2) are akin to Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – To initiate the acquisition proceedings, the State must publish a notice under Section 52(2) of the RUI Act for the owners or any other interested parties to show cause as to why their land should not be acquired – The object of issuing a notice under Section 52(2) prior to a notification under Section 52(1) is to allow the owners and interested parties to put forth their case as to why a land proposed to be acquired should not be acquired or to make representations regarding the amount of compensation – A reading of Section 52(2) shows that the conditions of publication of notice in the official gazette and pasting the same at a conspicuous area of the locality are together considered to be sufficient notice.
