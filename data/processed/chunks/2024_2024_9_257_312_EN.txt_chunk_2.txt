Warrant to the accused – Thereafter, on production of the accused before the jurisdictional Magistrate, like in the case of arrest of a free person who is not in custody, the accused can either be remanded to police or judicial custody, or he may be enlarged on bail and sent back to the custody in the first offence – s.267 can be invoked to require production of the accused before the jurisdictional Magistrate, who can thereafter remand him to the custody of the investigating agency – Such an interpretation of the provision would give true effect to the words “other proceedings” as they appear in s.267, which cannot be construed to exclude proceedings at the stage of investigation – Contrary to the view taken by the Rajasthan, Allahabad and Delhi High Courts, a person, while in custody in relation to an offence, can be arrested in relation to a different offence, either after getting released from custody in the first offence, or even while remaining in custody in the first offence. [Paras 38, 40-42, 46, 49, 51-53] 260 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Arrest – Subsequent arrest – Effect on accused – Plea of the appellant that as the object of s.438, CrPC was to prevent an accused from the humiliation of arrest, its protection would not include within its ambit a person who is already in custody: Held: Rejected – Each arrest a person faces compounds their humiliation and ignominy – Each subsequent arrest underscores a continued or escalating involvement in legal troubles that can erode the dignity of the person and their public standing – When a subsequent arrest occurs, it intensifies the emotional and social burden, amplifying the perception of their criminality and reinforcing negative s from society – Subsequent arrest in relation to different offences, while the individual is in custody in a particular offence, further alienates the individual from their community and adversely affects their personal integrity – Each additional arrest exacerbates the person’s shame making the cumulative impact of such legal entanglements increasingly devastating.
