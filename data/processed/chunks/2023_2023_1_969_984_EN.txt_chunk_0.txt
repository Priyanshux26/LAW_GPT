RAVINDRA BHAT AND PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, JJ.] Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 364, 201 – The prosecution case was that the victim ‘H’, aged about 7 years, went missing on C 8.10.1999 – On 10.10.1999, his dead body was found in the sugarcane field of ‘Y’ in Village – The victim’s father (PW-1) filed an application u/s. 156(3) Cr.P.C. on 19.11.1999 – FIR was recorded on 21.11.1999 – In the FIR, the informant alleged that he was told by PW-3 and PW-2 that they had seen A-3 taking deceased boy ‘H’ into her house on 08.10.1999 – PW-4 told him that on 09.10.1999 D at about 6 AM, he had seen ‘H’ standing along with A-1 and A-2 on the road near Y’s sugarcane field – In the trial, the prosecution relied on the testimony of 12 witnesses – The trial court convicted the appellants u/s. 302 IPC and sentenced them to life imprisonment as well as 7 years u/s.364, IPC and imprisonment for 5 years u/s. 201, IPC – The High court affirmed the trial court’s findings – On E appeal, held: The prosecution was not able to prove its case as there were serious flaws in the testimonies of two sets of witnesses (PWs 2 & 3 and PW- 4 & 5) who deposed to seeing the deceased with A-3 and the first two accused, on 08.10.1999 and 09.10.1999, respectively – PW-1’s conduct, in not stating anything during inquest proceedings, despite being informed about seeing the boy in the F company of A-3 on 08.10.1999, and later, on the early morning of 09.10.1999, by PW-2, PW-3 and PW-4, undermines the prosecution story – In the present case, save the “last seen” theory; there is no other circumstance or evidence – The time gap between when the deceased was seen in the company of the accused and the probable time of his death, based on the post mortem report, is not narrow – G Therefore, solely relying on the “last seen” circumstance to convict the accused-appellants is unjustified. Allowing the appeals, the Court HELD: 1. The conviction is solely based on the testimonies of two sets of witnesses, PW-4 and PW-5. PW-5 is a cousin of PW- H 969 970 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 1, and his behaviour in not interceding upon seeing the 7-year- old crying boy in the company of the accused, away from his house and despite knowing about the previous enmity between the parties, is unnatural. The police statement of PW-5 was recorded more than two months after the start of investigation, and the application under Section 156(3) CrPC does not mention that he B had witnessed the boy with the accused despite the witness’s statement that he informed PW-1 about what he saw. [Para 18][977-F-G; 978-B] 2. PW-4’s testimony that he saw the deceased in the company of first two appellants is unreliable, as him being a C resident of Akbarpur, went out to answer the call of nature at 6 AM to another village as Y’s field was located at village Narayanpur and returned home immediately, then, there is no explanation how he knew that the accused were standing at a specific spot.
