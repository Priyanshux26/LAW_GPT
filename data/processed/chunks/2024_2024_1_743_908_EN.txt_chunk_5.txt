Digital Supreme Court Reports to the appropriate Government for the suspension or remission of a sentence, the appropriate Government may seek the opinion of the Presiding Judge of the Court before or by which the conviction was had or confirmed and on considering the reasons for such opinion, may consider the application for remission – In almost all cases, the court before which the offender was sentenced is located within the territory of a State Government wherein the offence occurred and, therefore, in such a case, there can be no further doubt about the meaning of the expression appropriate Government – Even in a case where the trial has been transferred by this Court from a court of competent jurisdiction of a State to a court in another State, it is still the Government of the State within which the offender was sentenced which is the appropriate Government which has the jurisdiction as well as competency to pass an of remission u/s. 432 – Thus, it is not the Government of the State within whose territory the offence occurred or the convict is imprisoned which can assume the power of remission. [Paras 32.2, 33.2, 33.3, 33.5, 33.6] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 432, 433, 433A and 435 – Power to grant remission on an application filed by the convict or on his behalf – Exercise of: Held: Is an exercise of discretion by the appropriate Government – Where there is exercise of legal power coupled with discretion by administrative authorities, the test is, whether, the authority concerned was acting within the scope of its powers – This would not only mean that the concerned authority and the appropriate Government had not only the jurisdiction and authority vested to exercise its powers but it exercised its powers in accordance with law i.e., not in an arbitrary or perverse manner without regard to the actual facts or unreasonably or which would lead to a conclusion in the mind of the Court that there has been an improper exercise of discretion – If there is improper exercise of discretion, it is an instance of an abuse of discretion – There can be abuse of discretion when the administrative or exercise of discretion smacks of mala fides or when it is for any purpose based on irrelevant consideration by ignoring relevant consideration or it is due to a colourable exercise of power; it is unreasonable and there is absence of proportionality – There could also be an abuse of discretion where there is failure to apply discretion owing to mechanical exercise of power, non application of mind, acting under dictation or by seeking assistance or advice or there is any usurpation of power.
