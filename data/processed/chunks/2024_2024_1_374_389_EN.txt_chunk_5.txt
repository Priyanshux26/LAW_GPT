Further, it was submitted that Section 55(f) of the TP Act contemplates duty of the seller to hand over possession of the property at the time of sale, and if the seller is not in possession of the property at the time of the agreement to sell or thereafter, it is a “material defect” in the property necessarily to be disclosed to the purchaser at the time of sale in accordance with Section 55(1)(a) of the TP Act. Thus, according to him, it is the obligation of the seller to hand over possession at the time of sale, as was stipulated in the Agreement. 22. On the question of whether time is of the essence in such a contract, it was contended that when a party is not in possession to hand over the same at the time of execution of an agreement for sale, then time would not be of the essence as the right to sue would accrue in favour of the person to whom the suit property is required to be sold only upon the vendor being in a position to hand over possession of the property to the buyer. It was further submitted that subsequent conduct of parties is also relevant for testing whether time is of the essence of the contract in question. It was submitted that in the present case, the acceptance of money much after the expiry of the six-month period by the appellant no.1 from the respondents leaves no doubt that time was not the essence and the time for performance of the Agreement would commence only after obtainment of physical possession by the appellants. 23. In support of his contentions, learned counsel relied upon the decision of this Court in Godhra Electricity Company Limited v State of 382 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Gujarat, (1975) 1 SCC 199, the relevant paragraphs being 11 to 16; of the United Kingdom Supreme Court in The Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs v Secret Hotels2 Limited (formerly Med Hotels Limited), [2014] UKSC 16 dated 05.03.2014, the relevant being paragraph 331, and; The Interpretation of Contracts, 7th Edition by Sir Kim Lewison, the relevant being paragraph 3.189. ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION: 24. Having considered the matter, this Court finds that the impugned cannot be sustained. The moot question revolves around whether the Agreement dated 22.11.1990 discloses a fixed time- frame for making payment in full by the respondents that is, in terms of the recitals in the agreement for sale executed by the appellant no.1 in favour of the respondents. The admitted position is that the time indicated in the Agreement was six months from 22.11.1990 i.e., till 21.05.1991 and as per the Legal Notice dated 18.11.1997 sent by the respondents to the appellants, only Rs.7000/- was paid within the time stipulated. Perusal of the Agreement reveals that the respondents had agreed to pay the appellants Rs.21,000/- for the property in question, out of which Rs.3,000/- was already paid as earnest money and the rest was to be paid within 6 months.
