3 SCR 144 : (1994) 6 SCC 205 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 621 Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation Khedut Mandal, referred to hereinabove, that a plot owner who has surrendered his original land for the purposes of the Town Planning Scheme is not even assured of allotment of a reconstituted plot in lieu thereof. In such an event, he is entitled only to compensation. Therefore, there is no guaranteed right vesting in a plot owner who surrendered his land in accordance with the Town Planning Scheme that he would be allotted another plot of land in lieu thereof, much less, a plot of the same area. It is an admitted fact that, when the plaintiffs’ father surrendered an extent of 19823 sq. yds./16575 sq. mts., he was allotted a lesser extent of 15576 sq. yds./13023 sq. mts in two plots in the original Town Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi, with a deduction of 21.40%. 38. Though it has been contended on behalf of the plaintiffs that variation of the Town Planning Scheme as permitted under Sections 70 and 71 of the Act of 1976 must be read together, we find no merit in this submission. Section 70 deals with the power to vary a Town Planning Scheme on the ground of error, irregularity or informality while Section 71 is general in nature and states that, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 70, a Town Planning Scheme may at any time be varied by a subsequent scheme made, published and sanctioned in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1976. The very fact that Section 71 begins with a non-obstante clause referring to Section 70, manifests that the power thereunder is not fettered in any manner, unlike the power under Section 70 which can only be exercised on the grounds of error, irregularity or informality. Further, Section 71 postulates that the variation of the Town Planning Scheme is to be made, published and sanctioned in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1976, which would mean that the entire exercise would be undertaken afresh upon such variation, including reconstitution of the plots under Section 45. Therefore, further reduction of a plot notified in the original Town Planning Scheme is implicit in the general power of variation vesting in the authority under Section 71 of the Act of 1976. Reference in this regard may be made to the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in Bhupendra Kumar Ramanlal and others vs. State of Gujarat and others11, wherein It was held that Section 71 of the Act of 1976 provides for the procedure laid down in the Act of 1976 for making a Town Planning Scheme being 11 (1995) 1 GLH 1124 : (1996) AIHC 109 622 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports followed for the purpose of varying a sanctioned scheme. We are in complete and respectful agreement with the above view expressed by the High Court. 39. Viewed thus, we find that the plaintiffs, being well aware of the fact that Final Plot No.
