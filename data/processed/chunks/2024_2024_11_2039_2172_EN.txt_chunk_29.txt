The aforesaid and of the NCLAT once again extended the time limit for implementation of the Resolution Plan and satisfaction of the first tranche payment obligation of Rs. 350 Crore to 11.04.2024 i.e., the date within which the creation of charge over the various Dubai properties was to be completed (5th implementation extension). The same charge has, admittedly, not been created as on date. 26. In light of the above, the Appellants have challenged the aforesaid impugned of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2024 by way of the present Civil Appeals filed under Section 62 of the IBC, 2016. B. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS 27. Mr. N. Venkataraman, learned ASG appearing for the Appellants broadly classified his submissions into the following issues: i. That the direction of the NCLAT in the impugned dated 12.03.2024 allowing Respondent No.1 to adjust the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore towards the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore, runs counter to the judgement of this Court dated 18.01.2024. The Resolution plan mandates a cash infusion and the question of PBG adjustment would arise only when the three Dubai properties valued at Rs.250 crores are mortgaged by Respondent No.1. ii. That the NCLAT, through its impugned dated 12.03.2024 erroneously limited the Airport Dues to Rs. 25 Crore and further categorising it as a part of the CIRP costs especially when the Resolution Plan obligates an upfront payment of Rs. 475 Crore towards Airport Dues. Such an error is glaring since the [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2087 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. Resolution Plan clearly excludes the Airport Dues from the ambit of CIRP costs. iii. That the NCLAT while approving the Resolution Plan vide its dated 21.10.2022 increased the workmen’s dues from Rs. 52 Crore to Rs. 289.2 Crore (which according to the appeals filed by the workmen would be reduced to Rs. 226 Crore post the demerger of the ground handling business). An appeal against the stood dismissed by this Court on 30.01.2023. Therefore, it is a matter of concern that the impugned of the NCLAT limited the workmen’s compensation to a mere Rs. 12 Crore which is contrary to its earlier dated 21.10.2022 as upheld by this Court on 30.01.2023. iv. Clause 7.6.1 of the Resolution Plan deals with the five Conditions Precedent and imposes an obligation on the SRA to fulfil the same in to recommence the operations of the Corporate Debtor as an aviation company. The SRA could be said to have breached three of these conditions i.e. Condition (a) on obtaining the AOC; Condition (c) on obtaining the Slots Allotment Approval, and; Condition (d) on obtaining the International Traffic Rights Clearance. The NCLT, vide its dated 13.01.2023 had held that the Conditions (a) and (c) stood fulfilled and amended Condition (d) which effectively transformed it from a condition precedent to a condition subsequent. Such erroneous findings came to be wrongly affirmed by the NCLAT through its impugned dated 12.03.2024. i.
