When the bank guarantee came to be encashed in the year 2016 and the requisite amount stood transferred to the C Government account that was the end of the matter. This “Breaking Point” should be treated as the date at which the cause of action arose for the purpose of limitation. Negotiations may continue even for a period of ten years or twenty years after the cause of action had arisen. Mere negotiations will not postpone D the “cause of action” for the purpose of limitation. The Legislature has prescribed a limit of three years for the enforcement of a claim and this statutory time period cannot be defeated on the ground that the parties were negotiating. The case on hand is clearly and undoubtedly, one of a hopelessly barred claim, as the petitioner by its conduct slept over its right for more than five E years. Statutory arbitrations stand apart. The petition fails and is rejected. [Paras 61-63, 66][637-B-G; 641-E] Union of India and Another v. M/s L. K. Ahuja and Co. (1988) 3 SCC 76 : [1988] 3 SCR 402; J. C. Budhraja v.
