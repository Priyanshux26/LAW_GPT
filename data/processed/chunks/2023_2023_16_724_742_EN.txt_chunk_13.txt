7 shall be taken or reached without hearing all aff ected parties and particularly the Petitioners. (emphasis supplied) 25. Thus, SRA has to act in terms of its own policies and circulars without allowing private or contractual interests to prevail over public policy especially a policy which is welfare based. Apart from this, it is pertinent to point out that the Circular No. 162 was issued on 23.10.2015. The appellant society though has fi led two Writ Petitions subsequently in connection with the procedure for allotment undertaken by the SRA, yet it has not challenged the validity of Circular No. 162, instead it has sought to impose its private contractual rights over and above the statutory provisions which as we have seen above, is not permissible. 26. Consequently, we dismiss this Appeal and uphold the dated 22.10.2021 passed by the High Court of Bombay. The of status quo on allotment of fl ats given by this Court on 24.01.2022 is also vacated. The Slum Rehabilitation Authority is directed to carry out the allotment of fl ats in accordance with law. All pending interim applications are disposed of in terms of the directions contained in the present judgement. Considering the conduct of the Developer who has evidently taken a surreptitious route bypassing the statutory procedure, the SRA would be failing in its duty if it does not seek explanation from the Developer in this regard and takes suitable action in accordance with law.
