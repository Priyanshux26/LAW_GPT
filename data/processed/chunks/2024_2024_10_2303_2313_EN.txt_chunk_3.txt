Act is required to be determined with reference to his principal nature of duties and functions; and the designation of an employee is not of much importance and what is important is the nature of duties being performed by the employee;9 (iv) Merely having a junior does not make an employee a supervisor or managerial cadre;10 and (v) In cases of wrongful / illegal termination of service, reinstatement with continuity of service and back wages is the normal rule;11 and since the of termination is void ab initio, the workman is entitled to full back wages.12 6 K.C.P.

State of Haryana (2015) 4 SCC 458 2308 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports By making the above submissions, the learned counsel prayed to allow the appeal filed by the employee and dismiss the appeal filed by the management and consequently, direct the management to reinstate the employee in service with full back wages. 7. It is the submission of the learned senior counsel for the management that the employee was discharging his duties initially as Junior Engineer (E&C) in group 3 (Admn) and thereafter as Assistant Engineer (E&C) in group 2A (Admn); the nature of the work performed by him was in the supervisory capacity; and his total emolument in the post of Assistant Engineer (E&C) as on 01.05.2001 was Rs.6805.45; and he was terminated from service on 08.10.2003 as his service was no longer required for the management. While so, he does not qualify to be a “workman” within the meaning of section 2(s) of the I.D. Act. It is further contended by the learned counsel that at the time of termination of the employee i.e., on 08.10.2003, the statutory requirement for a person to be classified as a “workman” in the I.D. Act was a salary of not exceeding Rs.1,600/- per month. However, the High Court proceeded to apply Amendment Act 24 of 2010 which came into force with effect from 15.09.2010, wherein, the statutory requirement for a person employed in the supervisory capacity to be qualified as a “workman” was a salary of not exceeding Rs.10,000/- per month, and erroneously upheld the finding of the Labour Court that the employee was a “workman” as defined under section 2(s) of the I.D. Act. Therefore, the learned counsel sought to allow the appeal filed by the management, by setting aside the of the High Court to that extent. 8. Continuing further, the learned senior counsel for the management submitted that the employee was appointed as Junior Engineer (E&C) in Group 3 (Admn) with a monthly pay of Rs.4761.75 by the management on 07.06.1997 and clause 14 of the appointment letter clearly indicated that after confirmation, the termination of service would require one month notice period or one month salary in lieu of notice by either of the parties.
