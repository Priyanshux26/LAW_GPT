His original complaint dated 29.10.2015 which led to the registration of FIR in Crime No.441 of 2015 was against ten persons and the offences registered therein were only under Sections 406 and 420 read with Section 34 IPC. On this complaint, a Final Report was filed under Section 173(2) of the Code on D 13.06.2017 and this resulted in the registration of Calendar Case in CC No.3627 of 2017. Devasagayam was happy with the fact that the Report filed under Section 173(2) did not include the offences under the PC Act. Devasagayam was not bothered at that time about the fact that the register for entering the interview marks, sent to the Forensic Department had not been received. Suddenly, he became worked upafter the filing E of the Report under Section 173(8) leading to the registration of Calendar Case No.24 of 2021 including the offences under the PC Act. 21. What is shocking is that the High Court directed reinvestigation to be started ab initio, wiping out the earlier investigation altogether. One saving grace in this case is that even F the learned senior counsel appearing for Devasagayam and the learned senior counsel appearing for the accused could not support the operative portion of the impugned dated 31.10.2022, in Criminal O.P. No.15122 of 2021. Paragraphs 79 to 81 of the impugned dated 31.10.2022, needs to be extracted. They read as follows: G “79. Therefore, I am of the view that reinvestigation to be started ab-initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether and to collect fresh evidence and material in the above criminal cases. Hence, I allowed the Crl.O.P.No. 15122 of2021 in C.C.No.24 of 2021 for de-novo investigation along with C.C.No.19 of 2021. H Y. BALAJI v. KARTHIK DESARI & ANR. ETC. 1055 [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] 80. Therefore, it is directed the investigation should be conducted A ab-initio comprehensively without reference to the earlier investigation on record covering all the aspects in relation C.C.No.19 of 2020 and C.C.No.24 of 2021 including whether the offence under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 are made out against the accused. The special Court before which B C.C.No.19 of 2020 and C.C.No.24 of 2021 are pending will be at liberty to exercise power under Section 216 Cr.P.C, if there is any reluctance on the part of the State/investigating Officer. 81.Further, on completion of investigation, if the investigating agency makes out a case for cognizance of offence against the C accused then the investigating agency of the predicate offence shall provide the relevant materials/documents to the Directorate of Enforcement so as to enable it to invoke its jurisdiction to commence its enquiry under the P.M.L.A Act thereafter.” 22. By issuing the aforesaid direction, the High Court not only D directed the wiping out of the investigation carried out so far, but virtually wiped out even the of this Court dated 08.09.2022 passed in Criminal Appeal Nos.1514-1516 of 2022. Hail judicial discipline! 23. Shri Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appearing for the E accused and Shri Siddharth Aggarwal, learned senior counsel for Devasagayam, contended before us that the problem reflected in paragraphs 79 to 81 of the impugned is one of language and not of law.
