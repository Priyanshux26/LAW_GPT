Q.2 Whether the product manufactured and cleared by the assessee for the period 01.03.2006 to 10.07.2006 was required to be classifi ed under the CET SH 2403 9910 as ‘chewing tobacco’ or to be classifi ed under CET SH 2403 9930 as ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’? DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS BACKGROUND 34. The assessee herein was availing the benefi t of the Notifi cation No. 13 of 2002 dated 01.03.2002, issued in exercise of the power under Section 4A of CE Act, whereunder the goods/products were chargeable to a duty of excise with reference to value, notwithstanding anything 596 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. contained in Section 4 of CE Act, to be deemed to be the retail sale price declared on such goods, else such amount of abatement, if any, from such retail sale price by classifying the product manufactured as ‘chewing tobacco’. 35. Undisputedly, the assessee was availing the benefit of Notifi cation No.13 of 2002 dated 01.03.2002 and adopting MRP-based assessment. Even after the introduction of 8-digit tariff classifi cation (w.e.f. 28.02.2005), the assessee was availing the same benefi t. However, in the teeth of two classifications made under Notification dated 24.02.2005, re-organizing the CET SH 2403 9910 as ‘chewing tobacco’ and CET SH 2403 9930 as ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’, which attracted duty of 34% on both the products at the time, the assessee classifi ed or re-classifi ed the product manufactured and hitherto declared as ‘chewing tobacco’ to ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’. Notifi cation No.2 of 2006 dated 01.03.2006 issued in supersession of Notifi cation No.13 of 2002 excluded ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ and did not specify CET SH 2403 9930 for MRP-based assessment, or in other words did not include or did not specify ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ for MRP- based assessment. Hence, the assessee started classifying the product manufactured as ‘chewing tobacco’ though he had declared earlier as ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’. Thus, by virtue of such deletion/omission in light of Notifi cation No.13 of 2002, the assessment was required to be made under Section 4 which provides for the valuation of excisable goods for purposes of charging of duty of excise. In other words, the benefi ts that were fl owing from the operation of Section 4A having been excluded by virtue of the Notifi cation dated 01.03.2006, the assessee reverted to ‘chewing tobacco’ to avail the benefi t of Section 4A. In the light of the analysis of these notifi cations vis-à-vis the statutory provisions of the levy of duty or chargeability, it would not detain us for long to answer the questions formulated hereinabove.
