In contrast, the present case involves the enforceability of the Agreement to Sell dated 30.08.1990 and whether the subsequent sale deeds executed during the pendency of the suit affect the plaintiffs’ rights. While the respondents argue that the sale deeds are not void but subject to adjudication, the doctrine of lis pendens ensures that such transfers cannot prejudice the plaintiffs’ prior contractual rights. 35. Having thoroughly examined the s and authorities cited by the respondents, it is imperative to consider the primary precedents relied upon by the appellants. We will analyse their applicability to the present case. 35.1. The appellants have relied upon the in Pawan Kumar Gupta v. Rochiram Nagdeo10 to assert that when fraud and 10 AIR 1999 SC 1823 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2409 Shyam Kumar Inani v. Vinod Agrawal & Ors. misrepresentation are alleged by the defendants, the burden of proof lies upon them to substantiate such claims. In the present case, the defendants contended that the Agreement to Sell dated 30.08.1990 was forged and fraudulent. However, they failed to provide credible evidence to support these allegations. In Pawan Kumar Gupta (supra), this Court held that when a party alleges fraud or that a transaction is benami, the onus is on that party to prove the allegation. The Court emphasized that the apparent tenor of a document is presumed to be true unless disproved by the party alleging otherwise. The burden does not shift to the party relying on the document to prove its validity beyond its face value. Pawan Kumar Gupta (supra) reinforces the appellants’ position and supports their claim for specific performance of the contract. 35.2. The appellants have further relied upon the in Man Kaur (supra) to substantiate the argument that a power of attorney holder can depose on behalf of the principal in respect of acts and transactions that the attorney has personal knowledge of. In this case, this Court clarified that while an attorney holder can definitely testify regarding the acts they have personally carried out on behalf of the principal, they cannot testify about matters requiring personal knowledge of the principal, such as the principal’s state of mind or readiness and willingness to perform obligations under a contract. In the present case, the power of attorney K.D. Maheshwari was himself one of the vendees and all the transactions in the six suits having taken place simultaneously on the same day, same time and at the same place he was well aware personally of all the facts. 36. The subsequent purchasers and the intervenors, who had further purchased the property from third parties, will only get rights of their vendors. And if the vendors did not have any rights, the vendees cannot be said to be in any better position. 37. For all the reasons recorded above, the appeals are allowed. The impugned and of the High Court is set aside in all six appeals, and that of the Trial Court is restored. As the subsequent purchasers also joined in this litigation by filing impleadment/ intervention application(s), we allow the same.
