In other words, a challenge to an of remand on merit has to be made in tune with the statute, while non-compliance of a provision may entitle a party to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction. In an arrest under Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002 a writ would lie only when a person is not produced before the Court as mandated under sub-section (3), since it becomes a judicial custody thereafter and the concerned Court would be in a better position to consider due compliance. 31. Suffi ce it is to state that when reasons are found, a remedy over an of remand lies elsewhere. Similarly, no such writ would be maintainable when there is no express challenge to a remand passed in exercise of a judicial function by a Magistrate. State of Maharashtra v. Tasneem Rizwan Siddiquee, (2018) 9 SCC 745: “10. The question as to whether a writ of habeas corpus could be maintained in respect of a person who is in police custody pursuant to a remand passed by the jurisdictional Magistrate in connection with the off ence under investigation, this issue has been considered in V. SENTHIL BALAJI v. THE STATE REPRESENTED BY 869 DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] Saurabh Kumar v. Jailor, Koneila Jail, (2014) 13 SCC 436 : (2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 702 and Manubhai Ratilal Patel v. State of Gujarat, (2013) 1 SCC 314 : (2013) 1 SCC (Cri) 475 . It is no more res integra. In the present case, admittedly, when the writ petition for issuance of a writ of habeas corpus was fi led by the respondent on 18-3-2018/19- 3-2018 and decided by the High Court on 21-3-2018 [Tasneem Rizwan Siddiquee v. State of Maharashtra, 2018 SCC OnLine Bom 2712] her husband Rizwan Alam Siddiquee was in police custody pursuant to an passed by the Magistrate granting his police custody in connection with FIR No. I-31 vide dated 17-3-2018 and which police remand was to enure till 23-3-2018. Further, without challenging the stated of the Magistrate, a writ petition was fi led limited to the relief of habeas corpus. In that view of the matter, it was not a case of continued illegal detention but the incumbent was in judicial custody by virtue of an passed by the jurisdictional Magistrate, which was in force, granting police remand during investigation of a criminal case. Resultantly, no writ of habeas corpus could be issued.” (emphasis supplied) SECTION 41A OF THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, 1973 VIS-À-VIS SECTION 19 OF THE PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING ACT, 2002: Section 41A “41A.
