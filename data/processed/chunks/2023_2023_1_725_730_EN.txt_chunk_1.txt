While passing the impugned and , the High Court has heavily relied upon the earlier decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. Vs. H Harakchand Misirimal Solanki and Ors., (2014) 3 DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. NEM CHAND 727 SHARMA AND ORS. [M. R. SHAH, J.] SCC 183. However, it is required to be noted that the A decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. (supra) has been subsequently overruled by the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and Ors., (2020) 8 SCC 129. B 2.2 Apart from the above, even in the case of Indore Development Authority (supra), the Constitution Bench of this Court has observed and held that for attracting the provisions of Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013, twin conditions of not taking over of possession and not tendering/paying C the compensation are to be satisfied and if one of the conditions is not satisfied, there shall not be any deemed lapse of acquisition. In the present case, as observed hereinabove, the possession of the land in question was taken and handed over to the beneficiary department initially on 27.12.1990 and thereafter the remaining 1 bigha was D taken and handed over to the beneficiary department on 09.02.2007. In the case of Indore Development Authority (supra) in paragraphs 365 and 366, the Constitution Bench of this Court has observed and held as under:- “365. Resultantly, the decision rendered in Pune E Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183] is hereby overruled and all other decisions in which Pune Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183] has F been followed, are also overruled. The decision in Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. [Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. v. State of T.N., (2015) 3 SCC 353] cannot be said to be laying down good law, is overruled and other decisions following the same are also overruled. In Indore Development Authority v. Shailendra [(2018) G 3 SCC 412], the aspect with respect to the proviso to Section 24(2) and whether “or” has to be read as “nor” or as “and” was not placed for consideration. Therefore, that decision too cannot prevail, in the light of the discussion in the present . H 728 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 366.
