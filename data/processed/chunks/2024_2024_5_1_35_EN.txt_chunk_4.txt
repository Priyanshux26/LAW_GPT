It is submitted that, if the [2024] 5 S.C.R. 7 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India v. Satyanarayan Bankatlal Malu & Ors. legislative intent was that of legislation by reference, then a general reference could have been made in sub-section (1) of Section 236 of the Code to Chapter XXVIII of the Companies Act. Learned ASG therefore submitted that, if the reference made to the Special Court established under Chapter XXVIII of the Companies Act, 2013 is held to be legislation by incorporation, then the subsequent amendments to the Companies Act, 2013 would not be applicable to the Code. He submitted that since the Code has come into effect on 28th May, 2016, the provisions of Section 435, as it existed in Chapter XXVIII of the Companies Act, 2013 then, would only be applicable. Learned ASG in this respect refers to the s of this Court in the cases of Bolani Ores Ltd. vs State of Orissa1 and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. vs Union of India and another2. 7. Learned ASG further submits that the Code has been held to be a complete Code in itself in a catena of s of this Court. In this respect, he relied on the s of this Court in the cases of Ebix Singapore Private Limited vs Committee of Creditors of Educomp Solutions Limited and another3, Embassy Property Developments Private Limited vs State of Karnataka and others4, and Bharti Airtel Ltd. and another vs Vijaykumar V. Iyer and others5. 8. Learned ASG submits that, if a statute is a complete Code in itself, then normally a reference to the provisions of the prior statute referred to in a subsequent statute would only have a restrictive operation. In such a case, it would be a ‘legislation by incorporation’ and not a ‘legislation by reference’. In this respect, he relied on the s of this Court in the case of Girnar Traders (3) vs. State of Maharashtra and others6. 9. Learned ASG further submits that the Statement of Objects and Reasons (SOR) to the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017, amending the Companies Act, 2013 clearly shows that the amendment is for the purposes of restricting only to the Companies 1 [1975] 2 SCR 138 : (1974) 2 SCC 777 2 [1979] 2 SCR 1038 : (1979) 2 SCC 529 3 [2021] 14 SCR 321: (2022) 2 SCC 401 4 [2019] 17 SCR 559 : (2020) 13 SCC 308 5 [2024] 1 SCR 140 : 2024 SCC OnLine SC 4 6 [2007] 9 SCR 383 : (2011) 3 SCC 1 8 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Act and not for any other purpose. He therefore submits that the finding of the learned Single Judge of the High Court that in view of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017, the Special Court consisting of Sessions Judge or Additional Sessions Judge will not have the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint in question is totally erroneous. 10. Learned ASG submits that, in any event, the learned Single Judge of the High Court has erred in quashing the complaint.
