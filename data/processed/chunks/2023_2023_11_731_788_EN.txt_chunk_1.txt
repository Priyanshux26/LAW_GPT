[Para 48] Service Law – Memorandum of Association of the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences – Bye-Laws – Clauses 25(b), 34, 35 and 47 – Plea of respondent No.1 was that the provisions of FR 56(bb) would apply to him in his capacity as an employee of the Council in view of Clause 35, Bye-Laws of the Council by which the provisions of the FR and SR would apply to the employees of the Council mutatis mutandis: Held: Clauses 25(b), 34, 35 and 47 of the Bye-Laws in the Memorandum of Association indicate that the employees are recruited through a selection committee of the Council – It further indicates that the Fundamental Rules, 1922 will have no direct application in cases where the governing body fi nalises the rules of superannuation – In terms of Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws, the governing body had decided the age of superannuation to be 60 years on 01.12.1998 – The said decision was ratifi ed on 27.01.2000 - CAT rightly CENTRAL COUNCIL FOR RESEARCH IN AYURVEDIC 733 SCIENCES v. BIKARTAN DAS took the view that the plea canvassed on behalf of the respondent No.1 that the Council failed to consider the Clause 35 of the Bye-Laws which states that the FR, Supplementary Rule (SR) and General Financial Rules (GFR) as amended from time to time shall apply mutatis mutandis to employees of the Council, was without any merit and deserved to be rejected – CAT rightly rejected such argument because the applicability would be subject to the provision specifi c to the Clause 34 governing superannuation of the employees of the Council – There is nothing in Clause 35 of the Bye-Laws on the basis of which, it could be said that the same will have an overriding eff ect on Clause 34 as regards the age of retirement – Clause 47 of the Bye- Laws makes it abundantly clear that for the matters not specifi cally provided in the Bye-Laws, the rules applicable to the government employees would apply – However, as there is a specifi c provision regarding superannuation in Clause 34, the rules governing the government services in respect of superannuation are not applicable to the employees of the Council unless it is in accordance with Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws – Fundamental Rules, 1922. [Paras 25, 28 and 29] Words and Phrases – “or”, “and” – Interpretation – Plea of respondent No.1 that clause 34 of the Bye-Laws should be read in two parts- the fi rst part states that the Rules governing the retirement of employees of the Government of India as amended from time to time would apply to the employees of the Central Council; the second part of Clause 34 which reads “or as desired by the governing body” is merely an enabling provision empowering the governing body to take a decision whether an employee deserves to be retained beyond the prescribed age of superannuation and that such power should not be read in a negative form to clothe the governing body with the power to prescribe lesser age of superannuation than what has been prescribed by the Central Government from time to time: Held: Such argument cannot be accepted – The word “or” is normally disjunctive and the word “and” is normally conjunctive – Both of them can be read as vice-versa, but that interpretation is adopted only where the intention of the legislature is manifest – In the present case, the language of Clause 34 is very clear.
