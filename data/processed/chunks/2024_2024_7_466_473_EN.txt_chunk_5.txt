The appellant abused him and forced him to leave. It is pertinent to note that PW-2 Bisoha did not support the prosecution and was declared hostile. More importantly, Lakhan, who has allegedly seen the appellant dragging the deceased with her hair, has not been examined as a witness. 12. As admitted by PW-10, Investigating Officer, there is a temple near the deceased’s house, and other people live nearby. The incident happened in the evening before 7 p.m. There were two temples on the ridge of the pond. Obviously, there must be many people around the place of the incident. None of them has been examined as a witness. Moreover, the officer stated that it was not revealed during the investigation that the deceased shouted. An adverse inference must be drawn against the prosecution for not examining material witnesses, including Lakhan. Considering the evidence of PW-5, Lakhan was a very crucial witness. The prosecution has not explained his non-examination. PW-2, Bisoha has not supported the prosecution. Moreover, in the absence of injuries on the body of the deceased, it is very difficult to accept the testimony of PW-5 that by holding the hair of his mother, the appellant dragged her to the pond. Therefore, evidence of PW-5 of last seen together is not worthy of acceptance. 13. Considering what we have held earlier, the appellant’s guilt was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant was incarcerated for 11 years. 14. Hence, the impugned and dated 7th April 2018 and 9th July 2013 are hereby set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the offence registered with FIR No. 68 of 2013 of Police Station Kharora, district Raipur. The appellant shall be immediately set at liberty unless his custody is required in any other case. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Bibhuti Bhushan Bose (With assistance from : Nivedita Rawat, LCRA)
