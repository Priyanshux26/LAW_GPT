123. In Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited v. Bhadra Products,124 one of the issues before this Court was whether a decision on the issue of limitation would go to the root of the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, and therefore be covered by Section 16 of the Arbitration Act. This Court referred to Section 16(1) to observe that “the Arbitral Tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, which makes it clear that it refers to whether the Arbitral Tribunal may embark upon an inquiry into the issues raised by 123 Fiza Developers and Inter-Trade (P) Ltd. v. Amci (I) (P) Ltd., (2009) 17 SCC 796 124 (2018) 2 SCC 534 IN RE: INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UNDER 1153 THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT 1996 AND THE INDIAN STAMP ACT 1899 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI ] the parties to the dispute.” In Bhadra Products (supra), it was held that the issue of limitation concerns the jurisdiction of the tribunal which tries the proceedings. 124. In Uttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan Nigam Ltd v. Northern Coal Field,125 the issue before this Court was whether a referral court at the stage of appointment of arbitrators would be required to decide the issue of limitation or leave it to the arbitral tribunal. A Bench of two Judges of this Court held that the doctrine of competence-competence is “intended to minimize judicial intervention, so that the arbitral process is not thwarted at the threshold, when a preliminary objection is raised by one of the parties.” Moreover, this Court held that Section 16 is an inclusive provision of very wide ambit: “7.13. In view of the provisions of Section 16, and the legislative policy to restrict judicial intervention at the pre-reference stage, the issue of limitation would require to be decided by the arbitrator. Sub-section (1) of Section 16 provides that the Arbitral Tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, “including any objections” with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. Section 16 is an inclusive provision, which would comprehend all preliminary issues touching upon the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. The issue of limitation is a jurisdictional issue, which would be required to be decided by the arbitrator under Section 16, and not the High Court at the pre-reference stage under Section 11 of the Act. Once the existence of the arbitration agreement is not disputed, all issues, including jurisdictional objections are to be decided by the arbitrator.” (emphasis supplied) 125. In view of the above discussion, the issue that comes up for our consideration is whether an issue of stamping is a jurisdictional issue. Jurisdiction is generally defi ned as the power of a court or tribunal to hear and determine a cause, and to adjudicate or exercise any judicial power in relation to such cause.126 Jurisdiction refers to the authority of a court or 125 (2020) 2 SCC 455 126 Sukh Lal Sheikh v.
