Although it is true that the depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) do not mention the retaliatory firing by the bodyguards, an independently proven fact, this alone is not a sufficient ground to dismiss their presence at the spot or their versions including the culpability of the persons who had committed the offence. Offence under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC 34. Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) had averred to his presence at IGIMS hospital on 13.06.1998 in the evening at about 7-7:30 p.m. when he was shot at and received a bullet injury in his left arm during the attack on Brij Bihari Prasad. He called his brother, Sanjeev Kumar, who took him to Alok Nursing Home for treatment. Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14), however, did not identify the culprits. Dr. Tarkeshwar Prasad Singh (PW-8) examined injured Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) on 13.06.1998 at 9:30 P.M. and issued the injury report dated 08.08.1998 (Exhibit-10). The deposition of Dr. Tarkeshwar Prasad Singh (PW-8) refers to the entry and exit wounds on the left arm of Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) inflicted by a gunshot approximately two hours before the medical examination. In any case, it is proven that in spite of the number of people present, there was extensive firing and the use of firearms with intent to kill. The charge under Section 307 of the IPC is, therefore, established and proved. The Charge of Criminal Conspiracy 35. The case was transferred to CBI by Notification dated 07.03.1999, pursuant to which it conducted an investigation. The CBI filed two supplementary chargesheets implicating Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7) and Raghunath Pandey, who had since died, as conspirators who were responsible for the incident. A supplementary chargesheet was filed against Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7) on 08.11.2000, followed by a second supplementary chargesheet dated 20.04.2001 against Raghunath Pandey. 36. The prosecution case makes a charge of conspiracy based on an alleged meeting which took place in Beur Jail where Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) was incarcerated. Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) is said to have reportedly met with Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Lallan Singh (A-3) and Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6). However, the witnesses to this meeting, Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal 1340 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Babu Chaudhury (PW-39), turned hostile and did not support the prosecution version. This evidence is based on the testimony of Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) that Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39) informed him about the said jail meeting on 19.08.1998, nearly two months after the date of occurrence. Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-52) failed to establish how he discovered the purported version of Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39). He was also unable to establish that Sanjay Singh, the inmate whom Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39) had allegedly visited, was present in Beur Jail 2-3 days before the incident. There is no record of Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39) visiting Beur Jail.
