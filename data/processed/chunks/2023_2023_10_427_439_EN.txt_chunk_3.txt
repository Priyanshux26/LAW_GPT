11. It is against this of the High Court that the Appellant C has preferred the present Civil Appeal. 12. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. SUBMISSIONS: 13. Mr. Surajdipta Seth, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant argued that the Appellant had been continuously writing D letters in 2016 and 2017, and even after 15 years of litigation since 1996, after High Court’s directions regarding the Appellant’s absorption, the Respondents never absorbed the Appellant into regular service, even though his co-employees were. As such, the High Court ought to have adopted a sympathetic approach towards the Appellant and should not E have dismissed his appeal on the technical ground of delay. 14. The learned counsel further argued that the Appellant is an ex-census worker working continuously from 1981, i.e., before the commencement of West Bengal Municipal Act. Vide G.O. dated 19.03.1996, all those engaged prior to 31.12.1991 and still continuing in F service, became eligible for absorption, and so did the Appellant. The learned counsel also made a mention of G.O. dated 21.08.2002, which places ex-census employees in the exempted category which is to be directly absorbed in permanent vacancy. Moreover, the G.O. dated 28.06.2004 states that no approval of the Directorate of Local Bodies is required for appointments that fall under the purview of Local Bodies/ G Municipalities. 15. The learned counsel further contended that the Appellant though qualifying all criteria, exemptions and despite the High Court’s directions for absorption, he was sidelined while several other similarly H 432 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A placed employees (including his juniors) were absorbed. The learned counsel brought our attention towards the High Court’s dated 26.09.1996 in CO No. 9662 of 1991, directing the Appellant’s absorption in permanent vacancy. Moreover, on 22.01.1997, the Respondents directed the regularisation of those engaged prior to 31.12.1991 and were still continuing. However, such absorption of the Appellant never B happened in spite of the s. The learned counsel also brought to our attention the fact that the High Court’s dated 20.06.2000 passed in Writ Petition No. 19555 of 1999 clearly reflects that absorption has been given effect to vide dated 26.09.1996 passed in the aforementioned CO No. 9662 of 1991. The High Court had dismissed C the writ petition to the extent of entitlement of back dated appointment and arrears. However, the Respondents never paid any heed to such and inordinately delayed the Appellant’s appointment, while simultaneously absorbing other casual employees. The learned counsel argued that when a particular set of employees is given relief by the Court, all other similarly situated persons should be treated alike by D extending the same benefit. Not doing so would amount to discrimination, arbitrariness and would be in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. The learned counsel also referred to several letters in this regard as well as the Appellant’s service book which mentions that Respondent No. 3- Municipality has absorbed the Appellant in view of the High Court’s E dated 20.06.2000 in Writ Petition No.
