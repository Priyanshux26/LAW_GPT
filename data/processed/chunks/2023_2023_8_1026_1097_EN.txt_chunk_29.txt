Therefore, it is not as though the appellants have filed something to which they could E have never had any access. It is an irony that persons who are victims of a huge jobs-for-cash scam are alleged to have come to Court with unclean hands by persons whose hands were allegedly tainted with corruption money. 41. As a matter of fact, right from the time when Gopi approached F the High Court with a petition in Crl. O. P. No. 7503 of 2016, there have been several proceedings before the High Court where the parties have filed copies of several documents. There were also writ petitions filed by unsuccessful candidates challenging the selection. The counter filed by the Investigating Officer in those cases have been extracted by this Court in the dated 08.09.2022 in Dharmaraj vs. Shanmugam8. G Therefore, many of the documents have started appearing in the public domain at the instance of several persons. Hence, it is futile to contend that the appeals are liable to be thrown out on the ground that the appellants have come up with documents to which they could not have had any access. H 8 Criminal Appeal Nos.1514-1516 of 2022 Y. BALAJI v. KARTHIK DESARI & ANR. ETC. 1063 [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] 42. Though Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned senior counsel A appearing for the appellant in one of these appeals refrained from giving any political colour to the case on hand, it was contended by Shri Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel that the appellant had been obviously set up by a rival political party. In support of his contention, he relied upon the timeline of events that began after the lodging of the first complaint in B FIR No.441 of 2015.
