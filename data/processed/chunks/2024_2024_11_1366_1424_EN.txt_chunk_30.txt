Rathnam & Sons (2015) 10 SCC 681, where similar views have been expressed. 39 [1995] Supp. 1 SCR 349 : (1995) 5 SCC 482 40 [1995] 1 SCR 304 : (1995) 1 SCC 732 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1409 State of Andhra Pradesh and Others v. Dr. Rao, V.B.J. Chelikani and Others was found to be unreasonable and consequently, impinging upon the principle of equality. 55. Thus, it is crucial to recognise that the unreasonableness of a law, policy or state action can be both relative and absolute. First, unreasonableness can be comparative, meaning it is assessed in relation to something else. In Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi,41 this Court stipulated that a policy in question must satisfy two requirements under the reasonable classification test – (a) the classification must be reasonable; and (b) it must fulfil the twin conditions of intelligible differentia and rational nexus. Second, a policy may perpetrate discrimination inherently, instead of inter se discrimination vis-à-vis others. In A.L. Kalra v. Project and Equipment Corporation of India Ltd.,42 this Court held that one need not confine the denial of equality to a comparative evaluation between two persons to arrive at a conclusion of discriminatory treatment. An action/policy can per se be arbitrary, and such arbitrariness in itself constitutes a violation of the equal of protection under law. 56. It follows that the rigours of Article 14 cannot be interpreted in a narrow, pedantic or lexicographical manner.43 The doctrine of classification is neither a mere restatement of Article 14 nor is it the objective and end of that Article.44 In a catena of s, this Court has held that the reasonable classification doctrine is a judicial formula to assess whether legislative or executive actions are arbitrary, thus amounting to a denial of equality.45 It is arbitrariness that lies at the heart of the reasonable classification test. The principle of reasonableness – both legally and philosophically – is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness, pervading Article 14 like a “brooding omnipresence”.46 57. In recent pronouncements, this Court has clearly expounded India’s equality jurisprudence – from a reliance on the test of classification and arbitrariness to a more substantive interpretation of equality. 41 [1981] 2 SCR 79 : (1981) 1 SCC 722 42 [1984] 3 SCR 646 : (1984) 3 SCC 316, 328 43 Ibid. 44 Natural Resources Allocation, In re, Special Reference No. 1 of 2012 (2012) 10 SCC 1 45 Ajay Hasia (supra); Shrilekha Vidyarthi (supra). 46 Maneka Gandhi v.

Sikri J., in National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India and Others,47 had referred to the relationship between equality and dignity. In Navtej Johar v. Union of India,48 D.Y. Chandrachud, J. (as his Lordship then was) explicitly articulated the principle of substantive equality and remarked: “Equating the content of equality with the reasonableness of a classification on which a law is based advances the cause of legal formalism.
