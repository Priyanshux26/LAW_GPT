Learned counsel would submit that the appellants have failed to bring on record F any cancellation letter pertaining to the said 3 flats and on the contrary, they have made inconsistent statements about the date of cancellation while sometimes alleging that cancellation was in the year 2002 whereas stating before the National Commission that the cancellation was on 25.04.2005. Thus, it has been contended that the appellants had neither G been fair in their dealings nor consistent in their stand. 9.2. While placing strong reliance on the decision of this Court in Dr. Manjit Kaur Monga (supra), learned senior counsel has submitted that the said case relating to the same project and the same builder (the appellants) makes it clear that the appellants had duped the respective complainants by employing almost the same modus operandi. Learned H M/S SUNEJA TOWERS PRIVATE LIMITED & ANR. v. ANITA 1119 MERCHANT [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] counsel would submit that as regards claim for compensation, the A respondent’s case stands on a better footing than the case of Dr. Monga inasmuch as in the said case, the appellants had cancelled the allotment by a letter dated 30.04.2005 whereas no such cancellation letter is on record in the present case and in fact, the appellants stated about the alleged cancellation only in their reply dated 08.11.2005 to the notice B served by the respondent on 15.10.2005. This is coupled with the fact that the respondent had made payments of Rs. 30,000/-, Rs. 45,000/- and Rs. 75,000/-, respectively on 09.02.2002, 20.02.2002 and 25.01.2004, which shows that she was keenly interested in purchasing the flats for her private use. C 9.2.1. Learned counsel has further submitted that while both, the respondent and the said Dr. Manjit Kaur Monga, were duped by the appellants and resultantly both sought possession of their respective flats, the respondent invoked jurisdiction under the Act of 1986 whereas the said complainant approached COMPAT under the MRTP Act. Both the fora had concurrent jurisdiction as regards unfair trade practice, though D the respondent also complained of deficiency of service. Learned counsel has referred to the provisions contained in Section 12-B(3) of the MRTP Act and Section 14(1)(d) of the Act of 1986 and has submitted that the provisions are in essence identical, empowering the respective fora to award compensation though, the power to award compensation under E the Act of 1986 is wider in scope. 9.2.2. Learned senior counsel has further submitted that in Dr. Monga’s case, this Court has affirmed the measure of compensation for an identically placed complainant by refund of deposit together with 15% p.a. compound interest from the date of deposit till the date of F return. Learned counsel has recounted the factors constituting rationale in awarding such compound interest in Dr. Manjit Kaur Monga’s case, including those of extraordinarily long harassment; deprivation of flat; inordinate delay of construction; illegal retention of deposit; and then, compulsion to pursue protracted litigation. Learned counsel would submit that the respondent had been subjected to rather excessive harassment G for about 34 years and presently at the age of 73 years, she is required to pursue this litigation.
