That the Government dated 29th March, 2001 clearly records that the same was being issued pursuant to a clarification sought with respect to the incentives for persons possessing/acquiring Ph.D. and M.Phil. qualifications. Therefore, the said clarification would relate back to the date on which the previous Government dated 21st December, 1999 came into effect. C 4.5. It was further contended that the clarificatory dated 29th March, 2001 was issued only for the purpose of removal of ambiguities in the implementation of the earlier Government dated 21st December, 1999. Therefore, it is to be read as a part and parcel of the Government dated 21st December, 1999 and must not be D construed as a separate which seeks to modify or alter the rights conferred by way of the dated 21st December, 1999. 4.6. It was submitted that when an itself records in no unclear terms that it has been issued as a clarification of a previous , it must be construed as a clarification and not as an amendment/ E modification. Accordingly, such an must be made applicable retrospectively from the date on which the sought to be clarified came into effect. 4.7. It was next contended that since it was specifically stated in the dated 29th March, 2001 that the same was a clarificatory , F it was needless to specify expressly that the said would operate retrospectively. Hence, the learned Single Judge had erred in recording a finding that since the dated 29th March, 2001 did not specifically state that it would operate retrospectively, the same could not be held to have retrospective operation. G In to buttress this contention, Sri Surendranath has placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in Zile Singh vs. State of Haryana, (2004) 8 SCC 1; Commissioner of Income Tax, Ahmedabad vs. Gold Coin Health Food Pvt. Ltd., (2008) 9 SCC 622 and State of Bihar vs. Ramesh Prasad Verma (Dead) through LRs, (2017) 5 SCC 665 H 374 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A (Ramesh Prasad Verma) regarding the retrospective application of a clarificatory amendment to a statute. 4.8. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in S.Sundaram Pillai vs. V.R. Pattabiraman, A.I.R. 1985 SC 582 wherein this Court observed that an explanation added to a statutory B provision is not a substantive provision, but as the plain meaning of the word itself suggests, it is merely meant to explain or clarify certain ambiguities which may have crept into interpreting the statutory provision. In this context, it was contended that a perusal of the dated 29th March, 2001 would make it abundantly clear that it was meant to clear ambiguity in the application of Clauses 6.16 to 6.19 of the dated C 21st December, 1999 and not to withdraw any substantive rights. Therefore, there would be no bar to allow the said clarification to operate retrospectively. With the aforesaid contentions, it was prayed that the present appeal be allowed and the s of the learned Single Judge and the D Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala dated 13th October, 2015 and 10th August, 2016 respectively be quashed and set aside.
