Digital Supreme Court Reports of the CMRS certificate vis-à-vis “effective steps” – Admittedly, some of the defects were cured in their entirety and steps were taken by DMRC to cure the remainders – DMRC did take certain steps to alleviate DAMEPL’s concerns so as to warrant this change of position – There is no explanation forthcoming in the award about why none of these steps initiated during the cure period were ‘effective steps’ – This gap in reasoning stems from the arbitral tribunal wrongly separating the issue of termination and the CMRS certificate – The structure and safety of the project, as certified by the CMRS, were thus relevant before the Tribunal, making the CMRS certificate a vital piece of evidence in deciding the issue – The CMRS certificate was relevant evidence about the safety of the structure – The arbitral tribunal erroneously rejected the CMRS sanction as irrelevant – The Division Bench correctly held that the arbitral tribunal ignored vital evidence on the record, resulting in perversity and patent illegality, warranting interference – The conclusions of the Division Bench are, thus, in line with the settled precedent including the decisions in Associate Builders and Ssangyong – The of the two-judge Bench of this Court, which interfered with the of the Division Bench of the High Court, has resulted in a miscarriage of justice – Thus, Curative Petitions allowed.
