As a result, the litigation which should close at the trial level is taken up to this Court and the parties are forced to litigate. 15. As in the case in hand, the impugned passed by the High Court is cryptic and is bereft of reasons. In our opinion, the same deserves to be set aside and the matter is liable to be remitted to the High Court for ADITI ALIAS MITHI v. JITESH SHARMA 265 [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] consideration afresh. ed accordingly. As the respondent remained unrepresented, the High Court may issue notice for his appearance on the date so fi xed by it. 16. Considering the facts of the case in hand and the other similar cases coming across before this Court not adhering to the guidelines given in Rajnesh’s case (supra), we deem it appropriate to direct the Secretary General of this Court to re-circulate the aforesaid not only to all the Judicial Offi cers through the High Courts concerned but also to the National Judicial Academy and the State Judicial Academies, to be taken note of during the training programmes as well. ed accordingly. 17. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal disposed of. Ankit Gyan
