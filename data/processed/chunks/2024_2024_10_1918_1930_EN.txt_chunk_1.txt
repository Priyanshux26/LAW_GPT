The facts of the matter, succinctly put, are that the Respondent is a Government Company which was incorporated with an object to carry on mining operations for extraction of coal and supply thereof to core sector and non-core sector and is carrying on two coal mine projects namely ‘Krishnashila Project’ and ‘Bina Project’ in the district of Sonebhadra. The DFO had issued letters dated 23.03.2010 and 11.06.2010 to the Respondent seeking the deposit of annual lease rent for the year 2010-2011 for the forest land which has been transferred on lease to the Respondent for 30 years and 23 years respectively. The Respondent deposited the said amount under protest which further led to the issuing of letter dated 31.07.2010 by the DFO stating that since the amount has been deposited under protest, which is against the conditions of transfer, the matter is being referred to the higher level of the Government for cancelling the said transfer. Thereafter, the Respondent preferred a Writ Petition before the High Court challenging the above-mentioned letters and the demand of annual lease rent by the DFO. 1 Hereinafter referred to as “DFO” [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1921 State of U.P. & Anr. v.
