The prosecution examined 37 witnesses. The material against the appellant is in the form of one sentence in the evidence of PW5. The appellant was not confronted during his examination under section 313 of CrPC with the only allegation of the G prosecution against him. A serious prejudice was caused to the appellant. The incident is of 1995. It is not clear whether this aspect was argued before the Trial Court as the Trial Court has not reproduced the submissions of the counsel for the appellant. However, before the High Court, it was certainly canvassed as it forms a part of the written submissions. Even assuming that the H RAJ KUMAR @ SUMAN v. STATE (NCT OF DELHI) 757 defect or irregularity was curable, the question is whether today, A the appellant--accused can be called upon to explain the said circumstance. More than 27 years have passed since the date of the incident. Considering the passage of time, it will be unjust now at this stage to remit the case to the Trial Court for recording further statement of the appellant under Section 313 of CrPC. In B the facts of the case, the appellant cannot be called upon to answer something which has transpired 27 years back. The appellant has already undergone incarceration for a period of 10 years and 4 months. The conviction of the appellant stands vitiated. In the facts of the case, the option of remand will be unjust. The conviction and sentence of the appellant is set aside.The C impugned of the High Court is also set aside.
