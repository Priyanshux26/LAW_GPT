Therefore we must hold that the High Court ought not to have appointed an arbitrator in a manner, which was inconsistent with the arbitration agreement.” (Emphasis supplied) ICOMM TELE LIMITED V.

In 2008, the Punjab State Water Supply & Sewerage Board, Bhatinda issued notice inviting tender for extension and augmentation of water supply, sewerage scheme, pumping station and sewerage treatment plant for various towns mentioned therein on a turnkey basis. On 25.09.2008, the appellant company, which was involved in civil/electrical works in India, was awarded the said tender after having been found to be the best suited for the task. On 16.01.2009, a formal contract was entered into between the appellant and respondent No. 2 therein. 40. On 08.03.2017, the appellant approached the High Court of Punjab and Haryana challenging the validity of this part of the arbitration clause by fi ling Civil Writ Petition No. 4882 of 2017. The High Court merely followed its earlier and dismissed the writ petition as well. The matter was carried to this Court. 41. The relevant observations made by this Court are as under: “12. In S.K. Jain v. State of Haryana [(2009) 4 SCC 357 : (2009) 2 SCC (Civ) 163], this Court dealt with an arbitration clause in an agreement which read as follows: Xxx xxx xxx 13. In upholding such a clause, this Court referred to the in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. [Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly, (1986) 3 SCC 156 : 1986 SCC (L&S) 429] and distinguished this , stating that the concept of unequal bargaining power has no application in the case of commercial contracts. 966 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 14. It will be noticed that in this there was no plea that the aforesaid condition contained in an arbitration clause was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India as such clause is arbitrary. The only pleas taken were that the ratio of Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. [Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly, (1986) 3 SCC 156 : 1986 SCC (L&S) 429] would apply and that there should be a cap in the quantum payable by way of security deposit, both of which pleas were turned down by this Court.
