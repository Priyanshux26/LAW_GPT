Digital Supreme Court Reports national standards of independence and impartiality may be relevant to identifying international standards, just as domestic standards of procedural fairness can be relevant under Article V(1)(b), these standards should be considered with caution in international contexts. ….Only in rare cases should domestic standards of independence or impartiality be relied upon to produce a different result from that required by international standards”. 25. Embracing international standards in arbitration would foster trust, certainty, and effectiveness in the resolution of disputes on a global scale. The above discussion would persuade us to say that in India, we must adopt an internationally recognized narrow standard of public policy, when dealing with the aspect of bias. It is only when the most basic notions of morality or justice are violated that this ground can be attracted. This Court in Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. v. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)30 had noted that the ground of most basic notions of morality or justice can only be invoked when the conscience of the Court is shocked by infraction of fundamental notions or principles of justice. 26. In view of the above discussion, there can be no difficulty in holding that the most basic notions of morality and justice under the concept of ‘public policy’ would include bias. However, Courts must endeavor to adopt international best practices instead of domestic standards, while determining bias. It is only in exceptional circumstances that enforcement should be refused on the ground of bias. 27. Let us now turn to the present facts. The Award in this matter was passed in Singapore, a New York Convention Country and notified31 as a reciprocating territory by India. Chapter 1 Part II of the Indian Arbitration Act is applicable in the present case. The parties had expressly chosen Singapore as the seat of Arbitration. It is the seat court which has exclusive supervisory jurisdiction to determine claims for a remedy relating to the existence or scope of arbitrator’s jurisdiction or the allegation of bias32.
