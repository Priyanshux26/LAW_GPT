Companies Act, 2013 – ss.77, 78, 3(31) – Plea of the liquidator G that without registration of charge u/s.77, the same was unenforceable under liquidation proceedings – Held: s.78 enacts that when a company whose property is subject to charge, fails to register it, the charge holder (or the person entitled to the charge over the company’s assets) can seek its registration – s.3(31) defines “security interest” in the widest terms – Liquidator cannot urge this H 1224 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A aspect at this stage, because of the concurrent findings of the NCLT and the NCLAT that PVVNL is a secured creditor – Further, on facts, it is not appropriate to rule on the submissions of the liquidator vis- à-vis the fact of non-registration of charges u/s.77. Interpretation of Statutes –Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, B 2016 – Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003–Held: When an enactment uses two different expressions, they cannot be construed as having the same meaning – Reliance on Rainbow Papers case is of no avail to the appellant and that is to be confined to its own facts. C Dismissing the appeal, the Court HELD: 1.1 The priority of claims, indicated in the hierarchy of preferences, under the waterfall mechanism is therefore: Firstly, insolvency resolution process costs and the liquidation costs; Secondly, workmen’s dues for the period of 24 months preceding the liquidation commencement date and debts owed D to a secured creditor in the event such secured creditor has relinquished security; Thirdly, wages and any unpaid dues owed to employees other than workmen for the period of 12 months preceding the liquidation commencement date; Fourthly, financial debts owed to unsecured creditors; Fifthly, any amount due to E the central government and the state government and debts owed to a secured creditor for any amount unpaid following the enforcement of security interest; Sixthly, any remaining debts and dues; Seventhly, preference shareholders; and Eighthly equity shareholders or partners. This hierarchy or of priority thus accords government debts [clause (e)] and operational debts F [clause (f)] lower priority than dues owed to unsecured financial creditors.Debts owed to a secured creditor, whenever such secured creditor “has relinquished security in the manner set out in section 52” receive a fairly high priority (immediately after insolvency resolution process costs), whereas in other cases, i.e., G when the secured creditor does not relinquish security, the priority of claim is lower [Section 53 (1) (e) (ii)] in respect of “any amount unpaid following the enforcement of security interest”. Another feature is that amounts due to the government (i.e., payable into the Consolidated Fund of India or Consolidated Fund of a State) are ranked in the same manner as those of secured creditors H PASCHIMANCHAL VIDYUT VITRAN NIGAM LTD. v. RAMAN 1225 ISPAT PRIVATE LIMITED & ORS. who do not relinquish their security interest [Section 53 (1) (e) A (ii)]. [Paras 27 and 28][1244-C-G] 1.2 Section 52 gives an option to secured creditors to either relinquish their security interest, in the liquidation process (the procedure for which is prescribed in Regulations 21 and 21A of the Liquidation Regulations), or proceed to enforce it.
