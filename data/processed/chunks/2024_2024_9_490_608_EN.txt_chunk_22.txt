The finding that these two counterclaims were barred by limitation is premised on there being no material to indicate that they were included in the ongoing negotiation. (iii) The arbitral tribunal considered the three counterclaims on merit by adopting the same yardstick qua limitation as applied to the claims. These three counterclaims were not treated as barred by limitation as they were cited in the minutes of the meeting dated 19 April 2018 wherein the principal amount due to OPG was also acknowledged. It is thus incorrect to state that the arbitral tribunal adopted different yardstick on the point of limitation while deciding counterclaims than what was adopted to decide the claims. 522 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (iv) Enexio’s claim of the balance amount was not barred by limitation even if the limitation period is counted from the date of completion of the project i.e., 21 September 2015, because before expiry of the period of limitation of three years, that is before 20 September 2018, vide minutes of the meeting dated 19 April 2018, OPG had acknowledged in writing its liability towards the balance of the principal amount (i.e., Rs. 6,75,15,631) albeit subject to deductions. Thus, by virtue of Section 18 of the 1963 Act, from the date of written acknowledgment, which was followed by written communication dated 26 May 2018, fresh period of limitation of three years began to run. (v) Inference drawn from the minutes of the meeting as well as subsequent conduct of the parties to conclude lack of consent on Enexio’s part for deductions in the outstanding amount, is a decision within the remit of the arbitral tribunal. Therefore, any error, if at all, would be an error within its jurisdiction, which is not amenable to interference under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. Because, while examining the validity of an award under Section 34, the Court exercises supervisory and not appellate jurisdiction (vide: (i) Steel Authority of India Ltd. versus Gupta Brothers Steel Tubes Ltd.;15 (ii) Associated Builders (supra); (iii) Ssangyong Engg (supra); and (iv) Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. v. DMRC Ltd.16). (vi) The learned Single Judge had erred in observing: (a) That any infract qua limitation would violate public policy and attract Section 34 (2) (b) (ii) read with Explanation 1 of the 1996 Act.’ Because limitation is a mixed question of fact and law and if its determination depends on interpretation / appreciation of evidence / materials on record, any error, ipso facto, would not render the award amenable to interference as is clear from the Proviso to sub-section (2-A) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act. (b) ‘That different dates could not have been taken for determining limitation of the claim and the counterclaim, 15 [2009] 14 SCR 253 : (2009) 10 SCC 63 16 [2022] 3 SCR 716 : (2022) 1 SCC 131 [2024] 9 S.C.R. 523 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. when both were intertwined and had arisen from a common supply/works contract.’ Because three out of five counterclaims were decided on merits and not on limitation.
