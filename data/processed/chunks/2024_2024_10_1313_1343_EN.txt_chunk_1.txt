[Para 20] Evidence – Presence of eyewitness (PW-1) at the place of occurrence (hospital) proven, however there was [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1315 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others non- compliance with hospital and prison protocols – Reliance on testimony of PW-1, if proper – MLA and his bodyguard were murdered in the hospital where the former was admitted for treatment while in judicial custody – PW-1 did not seek prior permission from the court or jail authorities nor did he make any entry in the hospital register while visiting the deceased MLA in the hospital: Held: Fardbeyan (Exhibit-50) and the ocular evidence of PW-24 and PW25, establish the presence of PW-1 and other visitors in the hospital – Once the presence of a witness at the place of occurrence is proven, their testimony, if credible and truthful, should not be dismissed solely based on non-compliance with hospital and prison protocols – Further, the reasoning given by the High Court to disregard and doubt the eyewitness account of PW-1, on the premise that he ought to have been the informant because he is the brother-in-law of the deceased MLA and was present at the hospital at the time of occurrence, is conjectural and unfounded – Any person can be an informant of a case, and the police may also register a case on their own – The rationale of the High Court for dismissing the testimony of PW-1 is fundamentally flawed. [Para 15] Evidence – Testimony of hostile witness – Maxims – falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus – Inapplicability: Held: Maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus is not a sound rule to apply in the conditions of this country – This maxim does not occupy the status of rule of law – It is merely a rule of caution which involves the question of the weight of evidence that a court may apply in the given set of circumstances – Evidence of a hostile witness is not to be completely rejected, so as to exclude versions that support the prosecution – Rather, the testimony of the hostile witness is to be subjected to close scrutiny, enabling the court to separate truth from falsehood, exaggerations and improvements – Only reliable evidence should be taken into consideration – The court is not denuded of its power to make an appropriate assessment – The entire testimony of a hostile witness is discarded only when the judge, as a matter of prudence, finds the witness wholly discredited, warranting the exclusion of the evidence in toto – The creditworthy portions of the testimony should be considered for the purpose of evidence in the case.
