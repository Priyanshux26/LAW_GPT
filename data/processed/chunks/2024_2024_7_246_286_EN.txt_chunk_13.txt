Such disabling imagery formed “the bedrock on which the attitudes towards, assumptions about and expectations of disabled persons are based”40. Such portrayal perpetuated stigmatising views about disability as a vulnerability or a ‘suffering’.41 Recurrent negative portrayals as illustrated above and frequent use of patronising and offensive language such as “victim”, “differently abled”, or “unfortunate” 37 Jeremy Waldron (supra), Pgs 107,197 “I think we do need to ask whether we are past the stage where society is in such need of a robust debate about fundamental matters of race that we ought to bear the costs of what amount to attacks on the dignity of minority groups. Think of what those costs may involve. Are we re ally in need of such robust debate on racial ontology that we have no choice but to require individuals and families within minority groups to bear the costs of such humiliating attacks on their social standing?” 38 Bobby Art International (supra). 39 Colin Barnes, Disabling Imagery and the Media, An Exploration of the Principles for Media Representation of Disabled People, The British Council Of Organisations Of Disabled People, Part Two :Commonly Recurring Media Stereotypes (1992) Pg 7 <https://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/ sites/40/library/Barnes-disabling-imagery.pdf>; Angharad E.

Digital Supreme Court Reports to describe individuals continue to perpetuate negative attitudes towards persons with disabilities. 29. The problem with such portrayal is that it channels attention on the medical aspects of impairment rather than the social aspects that actually disable a person. This impacts persons with disabilities as individuals as well, subjecting them to stigma and social exclusion.42 30. As Allan Sutherland wrote, “stereotyped views frequently act as self- fulfilling prophecies, forcing the person with a disability into a role that can then be used to justify the original treatment.”43 They shape and strengthen the already existing negative assumptions about their abilities44. This resultantly exacerbates systemic inequalities, and inhibits their dignified participation in the public sphere for education or employment.45 31. Humour is a powerful medium of speech that can reinforce attitudes and influence behaviour towards groups. Pejorative jokes may reinforce stereotypical assumptions about disabilities, validating abusive attitudes and practices towards persons with disabilities.46 Humour, however, also has a complex dual role for persons with disabilities. It could be “both liberating and stigmatising” depending on the context of the joke and who is telling it.47 We shall advert to this dual role later. II. Stereotyping as an anti-thesis to dignity and non-discrimination. 32. This Court is cognisant of the impact of stereotypes on discrimination and the enjoyment of fundamental rights.
