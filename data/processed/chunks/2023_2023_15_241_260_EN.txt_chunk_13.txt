stands cancelled and the appellant is directed to surrender before the Court concerned forthwith. 56. Before parting with the present appeals, we deem it appropriate to deprecate the practice of depositions of material witnesses not being placed on record, as recorded in our dated 20.07.2023. We have observed that such practices often cause repeated adjournments, which goes to the root of pendency and delay in disposing of appeals. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to provide suggestions, in tackling this issue. 57. In this backdrop we must refer to XX of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 (referred to as ‘the Rules’), which concerns criminal appeals. A perusal of sub-Rules 2 & 3 of Rule 5 thereof shows that physical copies of the original records are to be called for, in criminal appeals involving sentence of life or the death penalty. In all other cases, the calling of such records is subject to specifi c s of a Bench of this Court. 58. We suggest the following: i. Sub-Rule 3 be amended to insert the words ‘soft copy’ before the words ‘original records’,resulting in e-copies of the Original Records being requisitioned. This would facilitate a much quicker availability of such records to the court as also further a more environmentally conscious approach. ii. Further, vide necessary amendment to the Rules such requisition of the soft copy of the record be extended to cases where leave is granted against an of acquittal or conviction. iii. Such soft copy of the records, once received be provided to the learned counsel appearing for the parties. 59. We direct the Registry to place a copy of this before Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for his kind consideration and appropriate directions, should he deem fi t. 60. Interlocutory applications, if any, shall stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal dismissed. Nidhi Jain
