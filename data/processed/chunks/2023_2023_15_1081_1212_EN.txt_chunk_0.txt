[2023] 15 S.C.R. 1081 : 2023 INSC 1066 CASE DETAILS IN RE: INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UNDER THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT 1996 AND THE INDIAN STAMP ACT 1899 (Curative Petition (C) No. 44 of 2023) In (Review Petition (C) No. 704 of 2021 ) In (Civil Appeal No. 1599 of 2020) DECEMBER 13, 2023 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI, SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, SANJIV KHANNA, B R GAVAI, SURYA KANT, J B PARDIWALA AND MANOJ MISRA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: The issue at hand arose in the context of three statutes; the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996, the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, and the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The Stamp Act imposes duty on “instruments”. Arbitration agreements are often embedded in underlying instruments or substantive contracts. The primary issue for consideration was whether such arbitration agreements would be non-existent, unenforceable, or invalid if the underlying contract is not stamped. The challenge before the Supreme Court was to harmonize the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and the Stamp Act, 1899. Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 – ss.8 and 11 – Arbitration agreements embedded in underlying instruments or substantive contracts – Whether such arbitration agreements would be non-existent, unenforceable, or invalid if the underlying contract is not stamped – Interplay between Arbitration Agreements under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 – Unstamped or insuffi ciently stamped instruments – If admissible in evidence – Non- stamping or inadequate stamping – If curable. Ed. Note. Hon’ble Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI pronounced the on behalf of himself, Hon’ble Mr Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Hon’ble Mr Justice B R Gavai, Hon’ble Mr Justice Surya Kant, Hon’ble Mr Justice J B Pardiwala and Hon’ble Mr Justice Manoj Misra. Hon’ble Mr Justice Sanjiv Khanna pronounced a separate but concurring . 1081 108 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Held (per Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, CJI) (for himself, Sanjay Kishan Kaul, B.R Gavai, Surya Kant, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, JJ. ): Agreements which are not stamped or are inadequately stamped are inadmissible in evidence u/s.35 of the Stamp Act – Such agreements are not rendered void or void ab initio or unenforceable – Non-stamping or inadequate stamping is a curable defect – The Stamp Act itself provides for the manner in which the defect may be cured and sets out a detailed procedure for it – An objection as to stamping does not fall for determination u/ss.8 or 11 of the Arbitration Act – The concerned court must examine whether the arbitration agreement prima facie exists – Any objections in relation to the stamping of the agreement fall within the ambit of the arbitral tribunal. [Paras 48 and 224] – Held (per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) (Concurring): Unstamped or insuffi ciently stamped instruments inadmissible in evidence in terms of s.35 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, are not rendered void and void ab initio – An objection as to the under-stamping or non-stamping of the underlying contract will not have any bearing when the prima facie test, “the existence of arbitration agreement”, is applied by the courts while deciding applications under Sections 8 or 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – An objection as to insuffi cient stamping of the underlying agreement can be examined and decided by the arbitral tribunal.
