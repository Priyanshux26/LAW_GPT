[2023] 15 S.C.R. 1067 : 2023 INSC 1036 CASE DETAILS SHASHIKANT SHARMA & ORS. v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ANR. (Criminal Appeal No. 3663 of 2023) DECEMBER 01, 2023 [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA AND SANDEEP MEHTA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Whether the prima facie ingredients of the off ence punishable u/s. 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act were made out against the appellants. Penal Code, 1860 – ss.147, 148, 149, 307, 323, 504 – Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 – s.3(2)(v) – Appellants, at the outset, conceded that so far as the off ences punishable under IPC are concerned, the prayer for discharge would require extensive evaluation of evidence and hence, challenge to the framing charges was given up – However, the ingredients of s.3(2) (v) of the SC/ST Act are not prima facie made out against the accused appellants from the admitted allegations of the prosecution. Held: As per the highest case of prosecution, the accused ‘VU’ fi red a gun shot at ‘R’ which hit him in the left thigh – The only projection made in the prosecution case regarding the off ence under SC/ST Act was that the witness ‘VK’ being a member of SC community was subjected to casteist abuses by the accused appellants after the gunshot was fi red at ‘R’ – However, the medicolegal report opined that a boil/abscess was noticed on R’s thigh and no evidence of gun shot was found – From a bare perusal of the s.3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act, it is crystal clear that for the off ence to be constituted, there must be an allegation that the accused not being a member of Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe committed an off ence under the IPC punishable for a term of 10 years or more against 1067 106 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. a member of the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe knowing that such person belongs to such ‘community’ – Going by the material collected during investigation, it is manifest that the incident had the undertones of a political rivalry – Be that as it may, as per the highest case of prosecution, the only off ence under IPC punishable with imprisonment of 10 years or more being the off ence u/s. 307 IPC has been applied on the basis of the gun shot allegedly fi red by the accused ‘VU’ upon ‘R’, which admittedly did not result into any corresponding injury – After perusal of the entire material on record, there is no hesitation in concluding that from the admitted case set up by the prosecution, there is no such allegation that the off ence under IPC punishable with imprisonment of 10 years or more was committed by an accused of upper caste upon a person belonging to the Scheduled Caste community with the knowledge that such person belonged to the said community.
