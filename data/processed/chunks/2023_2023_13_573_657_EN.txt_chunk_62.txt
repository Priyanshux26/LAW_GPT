The relevant facts were very much within the knowledge of the Department authorities. The Department did not make any attempt to lead any evidence that there was any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts with intent to evade payment of duty.” 140. In the facts of the present case, there has been no penalty levied under Rule 26 on the ground that there has been no intent to evade duty. In fact, the commissioner in his dated 27.09.2017 concludes at para 48.2 to the following eff ect: “..in view of the above there is no fraud or collusion or any wilful misstatement or separation of facts with intent to evade payment of duty to invoke the provisions of Section 11A (4) of Central Excise Act, 1944 in the present case.” 141. It is also pertinent to note that on 04.03.2015 the respondent-assessee sought to make a change in the registration certifi cate and claimed that the product manufactured by it was zarda/jarda. However, the appellant-Revenue called upon the respondent to withdraw the application for registration as ‘zarda’ and to show it only as ‘chewing tobacco’ and thereafter application showing the product as ‘chewing tobacco’ came to be fi led on 06.07.2015, and accordingly said application was allowed on 23.07.2015 vide annexure A-45 (volume II of the counter affi davit). Thus, the registration certifi cate itself refl ects the product as ‘chewing tobacco’. This court in the case of CCE vs. Tata Tech Ltd (2008) 11 STR 449 (SC) has held; “there cannot be a demand against the classifi cation under which the product is registered without undoing the classifi cation of the product in the registration certifi cate”. 142. For the reasons aforestated we are of the considered view that the fi ndings of the tribunal warrant no interference by this Court and the appeal has to fail. COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. AHMEDABAD v.
