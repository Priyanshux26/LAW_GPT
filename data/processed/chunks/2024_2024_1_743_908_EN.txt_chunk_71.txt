On the aspect of jurisdiction and nullity of s passed by an authority, the decision of the House of Lords in Anisminic vs. Foreign Compensation Commission, (1969) 2 WLR 163 : (1969) 1 All ER 208 (“Anisminic”), is of significance and the same can be cited by way of analogy. The House of Lords in the said case held that the Foreign Compensation Commission had committed an error which was a jurisdictional error as its decision was based on a matter which it had no right to take into account and so its decision was a nullity and subject to judicial review. Although in Anisminic, the scope and ambit of the concept of “jurisdictional error” or “error of jurisdiction” was very much extended, and of a very broad connotation, in the instant case we are primarily dealing with a narrower concept i.e. when an authority, which is the Government of State of Gujarat in the instant case, was lacking jurisdiction to consider the applications for remission. Just as an passed by a Court without jurisdiction is a nullity, in the same vein, an passed or action taken by an authority lacking in jurisdiction is a nullity and is non est in the eye of law. 33.10. On that short ground alone the s of remission have to be quashed. This aspect of competency of the Government of State of Gujarat to pass the impugned s of remission goes to the root of the matter and the impugned s of remission are lacking in competency and hence a nullity. The writ petition filed by the victim would have to succeed on this reasoning. But the matter does not rest at that. 34. Learned ASG appearing for respondent Nos.1 and 2, has placed strong reliance on the of this Court dated 13.05.2022 to contend that in view of the directions issued by this Court in Writ Petition No.135 of 2022, respondent No.1 – State of Gujarat had to consider the applications for remission filed by respondents No.3 to 13 herein. Further, the consideration had to be made as per the 1992 Policy of Remission of the State of Gujarat. Hence, the appropriate Government in the case of respondent Nos.3 to 13 was 846 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the Government of Gujarat in terms of the of this Court dated 13.05.2022. It was further contended that the offences had also occurred within the State of Gujarat. Therefore, the first respondent – State of Gujarat had no option but to consider the applications filed by respondent Nos.3 to 13 herein and pass the s dated 10.08.2022 granting remission to them. 35. Learned counsel for the petitioner in Writ Petition (Crl.) No.491 of 2022 has countered the above submission contending that one of the convicts-Radheshyam Bhagwandas Shah, respondent No.3 herein, had initially approached the High Court of Gujarat by filing Criminal Application No.4573 of 2019 for a direction to consider his application for remission by the State of Gujarat. By dated 17.07.2019 the High Court disposed of Criminal Application No.4573 of 2019 by observing that he should approach the appropriate Government being the State of Maharashtra.
