In short, the dispute in the suit is only regarding 0.12 acres of Plot No.432 and 0.18 acres of Plot No.438 i.e. total of 0.30 acres of the above two plots and the structures existing thereon. 6. The plaintiff-appellant is claiming title and possession over the suit land alleging that the Raja, the proprietor of the village, had settled the aforesaid land measuring 0.30 acres of the land comprising of Plot Nos.432 and 438 in his favour in the year 1942. 7. The case of the plaintiff-appellant was that village Ramgarh was the part of the Estate of Raja. It was under the management of the Court of Wards and was released in Raja’s favour in the year 1937. During the period of its management by the Court of Wards, its manager acquired 5.38 acres of additional land comprised in various plots including Plot Nos.432 and 438 in proceedings bearing Case No.1/1926-27 and came in possession thereof. 8. The Raja in the year 1942 made a permanent raiyati settlement of the suit land in favour of the plaintiff-appellant and also delivered its possession to him on payment of rent and salami of Rs.2,000/-. After [2024] 7 S.C.R. 33 Har Narayan Tewari (D) Thr. Lrs. v. Cantonment Board, Ramgarh Cantonment & Ors. vesting of the Estate of Ramgarh in the State of Bihar, the name of the plaintiff-appellant was mutated upon enhancement of rent @ Rs.2/- per decimal by an dated 04.01.1963 of the Additional Collector, Ramgarh passed in Case No.115/62-63 (Exh.13). The plaintiff-appellant had constructed certain structures on the said land which have been let out to various persons, all of whom are defendants in the suit. 9. Upon the establishment of the Cantonment Board, Ramgarh, the ex-proprietor Raja handed over 2.55 acres of land (excluding the suit land) with the dispensary building etc. to the Cantonment Board temporarily. The Cantonment Board, as such, never came in possession of more than 2.55 acres of land that too which was other than the land settled and occupied by the plaintiff-appellant. 10. In 1964, Maharani, the wife of the Raja, instituted a Title Suit No.8/64, inter alia, for declaration of her title over 5.38 acres of the land of the village including 0.30 acres land of the plaintiff-appellant. The aforesaid claim was made on the basis of the maintenance grant allegedly made by the Raja in her favour. 11. The aforesaid suit was contested by the plaintiff-appellant by filing a written statement and claiming 0.30 acres land on the basis of raiyati rights granted by the Raja in the year 1942. The Cantonment Board, Ramgarh, claimed distinct rights in different portions of the land to the extent of 2.55 acres only, comprising of dispensary building and quarters of the doctors on the basis of possessory rights granted by the Raja. 12. In the aforesaid case, Maharani entered into a compromise with several defendants including the plaintiff-appellant (who was defendant No.32 in the said suit). According to the said compromise, Maharani admitted the possession of the plaintiff-appellant over the suit land to the extent of 0.30 acres in Plot Nos.432 and 438 and it was agreed that she will have no concern with the same and that the plaintiff-appellant will remain in exclusive possession of it.
