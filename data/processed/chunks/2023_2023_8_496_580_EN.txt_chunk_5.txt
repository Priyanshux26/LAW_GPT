per SANJAY KAROL, J. (Separately concurring as well) F 1. The contradistinction between the rights created by the First Amendment of the American Constitution and Article 19 of the Indian Constitution is the power given to the State to make laws reasonably restricting such freedoms in India. Conversely, in the United States of America, restrictions have been imposed G by the Judiciary in instances, as relied upon in Arup Bhuyan and Indra Das, however no such explicit power is available with the Legislature. [Para 15][567-C] 2. In Arup Bhayan, the Court placed reliance on American decisions in Elfbrandt v. Russel, Clarence Brandenberg v. State of H ARUP BHUYAN v. STATE OF ASSAM & ANR. 503 Ohio and United States v. Eugene Frank Robel wherein the doctrine A of ‘guilt by association’ has been rejected. The court observed that the abovementioned s apply to India too, since the fundamental rights in India are similar to the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution. The abovementioned decisions are in contradistinction to the scenario in question in India. The B American decisions primarily involve indictment on the basis of membership of political organizations or incidents of free speech advocating overthrow of the government. However, under Indian law, it is not membership of political organizations etc. or free speech or criticism of the government that is sought to be banned, it is only those organizations which aim to compromise the C sovereignty and integrity of India and have been notified to be such and unlawful, whose membership is prohibited. This is in furtherance of the objective of the UAPA, which has been enacted to provide for the more effective prevention of certain unlawful activities of individuals and associations and dealing with terrorist D activities and for matters connected therewith. The distinction, therefore, is clear. [Paras 30 and 48][572-F; 579-A-C] 3. There is “a world of difference” between the American and Indian scenario, so far as, sub serving public interest is concerned. It is this difference which seemed to have escaped E the division bench’s attention in Arup Bhyan and Indra Das. Therefore, placing reliance on decisions rendered in a distinct scenario as well as a demonstrably different constitutional position, that too almost singularly, especially in cases which involve considerations of national security and sovereignty, was not justified.
