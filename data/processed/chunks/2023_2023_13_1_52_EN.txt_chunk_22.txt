In the English system of jurisprudence, in the absence of a written Constitution, the repugnance of such laws is justifi ed on universal notions of fairness and justice, not on the ground of invalidating the law itself, but as compelling the benefi cial construction thereof where the language of the statute by any means permits it. Under the American law, ex post facto laws are rendered invalid by virtue of Article 1, Sections 9 and 1053. 29. Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh (supra) observes that the language of sub-article (1) of Article 20 of the Constitution is much wider in terms as the prohibition under the Article is not confi ned to the passing of validity of the law, and that fullest eff ect must be given to the actual words used and what they convey. Accordingly, the decision had struck down Vidhya Pradesh Ordinance 48 of 1949, which though enacted on 11.09.1949, had postulated that the provisions would deemed to have come into force in Vidhya Pradesh on 09.04.1948, a date prior to the date of commission of off ences. Interpreting 50 (1953) 2 SCC 111 51 1 (1870) LR 6 QB 1 at pp. 23 and 25 52 1 L Ed 648 at p. 649 : 3 US (3 Dall) 386 (1798) 53 It may be noted that the provisions of the American Constitution are diff erently worded. We must keep in view the language of sub-article (1) of Article 20. CBI v. R.R. KISHORE 33 [VIKRAM NATH, J.] the term ‘law in force’, it was held that the ordinance giving retrospective eff ect would not fall within the meaning of the phrase ‘law in force’ as used in sub-article (1) of Article 20 of the Constitution. The ‘law in force’ must be taken to relate not to a law deemed to be in force, but factually in force, and then only it will fall within the meaning of ‘existing law’. Artifi ce or fi ction will fall foul, when they are with the intent to defeat the salutary object and purpose behind sub-article (1) of Article 20 of the Constitution54. 30. The aforesaid rationale and principles of interpretation equally apply to the second part of sub-article (1) to Article 20, which states that a person can only be subjected to penalties prescribed under the law at the time when the off ence for which he is charged was committed. Any additional or higher penalty prescribed by any law after the off ence was committed cannot be imposed or infl icted on him. The sub-article does not prohibit substitution of the penalty or sentence which is not higher or greater than the previous one or modifi cation of rigours of criminal law55. 31. In view of the limited scope of the present controversy, we need not examine in greater detail sub-article (1) of Article 20. The reason why we have referred to the constitutional guarantee, which protects the citizens and persons from retrospective ex post facto laws, is to affi rm that our decision in no way dilutes the constitutional mandate.
