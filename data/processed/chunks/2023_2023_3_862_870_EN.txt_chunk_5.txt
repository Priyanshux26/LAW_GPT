The allotment letter dated 14.07.1995 which is in favour of the Respondent therein contains a specific clause regarding payment of enhanced compensation in terms of decision of this Court. The relevant clause is extracted below: “The amount of enhanced compensation shall be payable as D per decision of court. 30,780/-” 19. It was in terms of the aforesaid clause in the agreement specifically providing for payment of enhanced compensation by the allottee that demand thereof was upheld by this Court. 20.A perusal of clause-5 in the allotment letter shows that option E has been given to vary the price of the plot in case there is change in the size of plot. The entire clause has to be read in totality and no part in isolation. This clause does not talk about demand of additional price on account of any other factor specially the one raised in the present appeals, namely, on account of enhancement of compensation on account of acquisition of land for carving of the plots. F 21.Even the clauses as contained in the lease-cum-sale agreement also does not come to the rescue of the Appellant for the reason that it talks about the negotiated price between the vendor and the vendee. The vendor in the case at hand is the Appellant and the vendee is the Respondent. Sale consideration as such has not been mentioned in the G lease-cum-sale agreement, however, the price as negotiated between the parties is clearly mentioned in the letter of allotment and thesame has to be read as partofthe lease-cum-sale agreement. 22.For the reasons mentioned above, we do not find any merit in the appeals. The same are dismissed. However, we make it clear that in H 870 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A case any other allottee who has deposited the amount, initiates any litigation now, the same shall be considered keeping in view the delay and laches and principles of acquiescence.
