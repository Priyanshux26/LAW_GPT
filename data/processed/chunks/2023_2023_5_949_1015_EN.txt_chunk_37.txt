It is submitted that moreover, the Ministry withheld various key facts from the NCLT at the time of filing. 4.1 Now so far as the direction issued under Section 212(14) and F the prosecution under Section 212(15), it is submitted as under: i) Section 212(1) provides that the Central Government may direct the SPIO to investigate into the affairs of a company inter alia upon a receipt of the report of the Registrar, on intimation of a special resolution passed by a company, in public interest or on G request from any Department of the Central Government or State Government; ii) Section 212(11) provides that SFIO must submit an “interim report” to the Central Government, if the SFIO is directed to do so by the Central Government; H UNION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER V. DELOITTE HASKINS 999 AND SELLS LLP [M. R. SHAH, J.] iii) Section 212(12) requires SFIO to submit an “investigation A report” to the Central Government only upon “completion of the investigation”. Therefore, an “investigation report” cannot be submitted at any time prior to the completion of the investigation, whereas an “interim report” under Section 212(11) can be submitted at any stage; B iv) Under Section 212(14), the Central Government has been empowered to direct SPIO to initiate prosecution against a company or its officers, if the Central Government considers it necessary after examination of only the “investigation report” issued under Section 212(12), i.e., after completion of the C investigation. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Serious Fraud Investigation Office v Rahul Modi (2019) 5 SCC 266 (Para 30); v) Section 212(14) permits the Central Government to take legal advice when examining the “investigation report”, which itself D gives colour to the word “examination” and shows that the Central Government is to properly apply its mind to the “investigation report” before directing initiation of prosecution, Le, not to do so mechanically or for collateral purposes; vi) Section 212(14A) provides that where the report under Section E 212(11) or 212(12) stated that fraud has taken place and has been taken advantage of by a director, key managerial personnel or other officer, the Central Government may file an application before the NCLT for appropriate s for disgorgement of asset and for holding such person liable personally; vii) Under Section 212(15), it is only the “investigation report” F (submitted only upon completion of the investigation which is filed with the Special Court is deemed to be police officer’s report under Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. (CHPC) Significantly, Section 212(15) is a deeming fiction that is limited to only making investigation report under Section 212(12), to be the G police officer’s report under Section 173, CrPC; viii) It is therefore clear that the legislature has envisaged two distinct kinds of reports, with its own specific purpose. The first kind of report is under Section 212(11). which report is an ‘Interim Report’ and can be issued at any point of time during the course H 1000 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R.
