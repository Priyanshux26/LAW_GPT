[2024] 1 S.C.R. 245 SATISH P. BHATT v. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA & ANR 10. Thereafter it appears that the present appellant Satish P.Bhatt filed a criminal application in the pending revision on 16th April, 2019 stating that he had paid his share of Rs.1,95,00,000/- being 50% of Rs.3,90,00,000/- as mentioned in the dated 3rd July, 2018 and, therefore, he may be absolved of the charges and acquitted. On the said application, notice was issued to the complainant on 19th June, 2019 fixing 10th July, 2019. On that date, it was adjourned to 16th July, 2019. Thereafter on 16th July it was adjourned to 23rd July, 2019.
