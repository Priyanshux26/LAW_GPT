It is, thereafter, that the Law-Giver has interdicted the guardian from binding the minor by a personal covenant. [Para 20] [275-G-H; 276-A-C] D 5.2. In the facts of this case, it is the case of the appellants, that ‘C’, their father, himself did not have any right in the plaint schedule property. This is for the reason that being the separate property of ‘S’, ‘C’ did not have any right by birth. He himself had only, what is described a spec successionis within the meaning E of Section 6(a) of the Transfer of Property Act. It is not even the case of the appellants that they had any independent right in the plaint schedule property either at the time of their birth or at the time when their father died or even when their grandfather ‘S’ died in 1988. The right, which they claim, at the earliest point, F can arise only by treating the property as the separate property of ‘S’ on his death within the meaning of Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act. Therefore, one is unable to discard the deed of release executed by ‘C’ in the year 1975 as a covenant within the meaning of Section 8 of the ‘1956 Act.’ [Para 21][276-D-F] G 6. The appellants would not be in a position to claim immunity from the operation of the Principle of Estoppel on the basis of Section 8(a) of the Hindu Succession Act. If the principle H 266 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A in Gulam Abbas case applies, then, despite the fact that what was purported to be released by ‘C’, was a mere spec successonis or expectation his conduct in transferring/releasing his rights for valuable consideration, would give rise to an estoppel. The effect of the estoppel cannot be warded off by persons claiming through B the person whose conduct has generated the estoppel. Also there is no merit at all in the attempt at drawing a distinction based on religion. The principle of estoppel applies without such distinction. [Para 23][277-G-H; 278-A-B] 7. Having received valuable consideration and allowed his C father ‘S’ to proceed on the basis that he was free to deal with the property without the prospect of being haunted by any claim whatsoever as regards the property by ‘C’, a clear estoppel sprang into existence following the receipt of consideration by ‘C’. Estoppel would shut out in equity any claim otherwise either D by ‘C’ or his children, viz., the appellants. [Para 24][278-C-D] Gullam Abbas v.
