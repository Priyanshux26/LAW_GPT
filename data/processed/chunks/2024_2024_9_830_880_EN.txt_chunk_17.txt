As far as the other appellants are concerned, he fairly submitted that even according to the Mumbai Municipal Corporation they have complied with the conditions as required under the scheme and therefore, their cases could be considered if they are otherwise eligible for compensation being paid to them in case they are successful in these appeals. 9.2 Learned senior counsel also strenuously sought to buttress the submissions made on behalf of the Mumbai Municipal [2024] 9 S.C.R. 855 Kukreja Construction Company & Others v. State of Maharashtra & Others Corporation before the High Court regarding the of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I, but did not persuade himself to do so. Ultimately, he supported the of the High Court in denying the reliefs to the writ petitioners who had delayed in making their claims. He contended that the High Court was right in declining to grant the relief to the said parties. 9.3 Sri Nadkarni contented that firstly, the High Court was right in declining relief based on the of this Court in Godrej and Boyce I owing to delay, as those developers who already availed of the TDR and accepted the same without any protest or demur could not again agitate the matter after the judgement of this Court in Godrej and Boyce I. Secondly, there was a crystallisation of the compensation payable in the form of FSI/TDR as on the date of the notice of acquisition which in this case could be either the publication of the development plan or the date of preliminary notification under the Acquisition Act and that the owner or lessee could not have returned for a second helping or make an additional claim of 100% TDR since the value of the land as on the date when the project was conceived or when the benefits were received would have been lesser than the value of the land on the date of the filing of the writ petition. Thirdly, any grant of additional TDR despite there being a delay would result in unjust enrichment of the owner and the lessee who could get an advantage of escalation in price of land which is contrary to public interest. Therefore, for this reason also, the High Court was justified in declining to grant relief on the ground of delay and laches. Hence, there is no merit in these appeals. 9.4 Learned senior counsel submitted that in the event this Court is to condone the delay and laches and thereby modifies the impugned of the High Court then, in the case of the appellants in CA No. 9702 of 2024, (Kukreja Construction company and others) this Court may direct that only on complying with the mandatory requirements could the said appellant avail of the benefits of additional FSI/TDR in accordance with law as indicated in the table above. 9.5 Learned senior counsel, Sri Nadkarni, with reference to our dated 06.08.2024, sought further instruction on Estate Investment Company Ltd. and Ever-smile Construction being 856 [2024] 9 S.C.R.
