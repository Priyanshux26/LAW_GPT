The High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction in a matter of this nature is required to determine at the outset as to whether a case has been made out for issuance of a writ of certiorari or a writ of quo warranto. The jurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ of quo warranto is a limited one. While issuing such a writ, the Court merely makes a public declaration but will not consider the respective impact on the candidates or other factors which may be relevant for issuance of a writ of certiorari. (See R.K. Jain v. Union of India [(1993) 4 SCC 119 : 1993 SCC (L&S) 1128 : (1993) 25 ATC 464], SCC para 74.) 23. A writ of quo warranto can only be issued when the appointment is contrary to the statutory rules. (See Mor Modern Coop. Transport Society Ltd. v. Financial Commr. & Secy. to Govt. of Haryana (2002) 6 SCC 269. )” 36. In B. Srinivasa Reddy v. Karnataka Urban Water Supply & Drainage Board Employees’ Assn. reported in (2006) 11 SCC 731, the limitations of the writ of quo warranto were elaborated upon by a two-Judge Bench of this Court. The court observed: “49. … The jurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ of quo warranto is a limited one which can only be issued when the appointment is contrary to the statutory rules. xxx xxx xxx 51. It is settled law by a catena of decisions that the court cannot sit in over the wisdom of the Government in the choice of the 416 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. person to be appointed so long as the person chosen possesses the prescribed qualifi cation and is otherwise eligible for appointment. This Court in R.K. Jain v. Union of India [(1993) 4 SCC 119 : 1993 SCC (L&S) 1128 : (1993) 25 ATC 464] was pleased to hold that the evaluation of the comparative merits of the candidates would not be gone into a public interest litigation and only in a proceeding initiated by an aggrieved person, may it be open to be considered. It was also held that in service jurisprudence it is settled law that it is for the aggrieved person, that is, the non-appointee to assail the legality or correctness of the action and that a third party has no locus standi to canvass the legality or correctness of the action. Further, it was declared that public law declaration would only be made at the behest of a public-spirited person coming before the court as a petitioner…” (Emphasis supplied) 37. In Central Electricity Supply Utility of Odisha v. Dhobei Sahoo and Ors. reported in (2014) 1 SCC 161, another two-Judge Bench of this Court reiterated that: “21. …the jurisdiction of the High Court while issuing a writ of quo warranto is a limited one and can only be issued when the person holding the public offi ce lacks the eligibility criteria or when the appointment is contrary to the statutory rules.
