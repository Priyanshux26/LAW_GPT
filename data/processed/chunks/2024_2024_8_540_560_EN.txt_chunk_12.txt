v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. 17. MADA (supra) has upheld the legislative competence of States under Entries 49 and 50 of List II. If MADA (supra) is given a prospective application, the validity of all relevant legislation enacted before the date of the decision, that is 25 July 2024, will have to be tested on the touchstone of the previous law. The previous law on the aspects of interpretation of Entry 54 of List I and Entries 23 and 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule was unsettled because of the conflicting decisions in India Cement (supra) and Kesoram (supra). There is always a presumption of constitutionality in favor of a statutory enactment. It is based on the theory that the elected representatives are aware of the needs of the citizens and are best placed to frame policies to resolve them.29 Legislation represents the will of the people and cannot be lightly interfered with unless it transgresses constitutional principles.30 If MADA (supra) is applied prospectively, the relevant taxing legislations may conceivably be invalidated, requiring the States to refund the amount collected to the assesses. Since MADA (supra) has answered the reference and resolved the conflict, it would be iniquitous to apply the decision prospectively. 18. The learned Solicitor General relied on the Constitution Bench decision in Bharat Aluminium Co. v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc.31 to draw upon the point that this Court has applied the doctrine of prospective overruling where the parties have entered into commercial relations based on the prevailing legal position. In Bharat Aluminium (supra), this Court held: “197. The in Bhatia International [(2002) 4 SCC 105] was rendered by this Court on 13-3-2002. Since then, the aforesaid has been followed by all the High Courts as well as by this Court on numerous occasions. In fact, the in Venture Global Engg. [(2008) 4 SCC 190] has been rendered on 10-1-2008 in terms of the ratio of the decision in Bhatia International [(2002) 4 SCC 105]. Thus, in to do complete justice, we hereby , that the law now declared by this Court 29 Association for Democratic Reforms v. Union of India (2024) 5 SCC 1 [45] 30 Charanjit Lal Chowdhury v. Union of India [1950] SCR 869; State of Bihar v. Bihar Distillery Ltd. (1997) 2 SCC 453 [17] 31 [2012] 12 SCR 327 : (2012) 9 SCC 552 558 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports shall apply prospectively, to all the arbitration agreements executed hereafter.” 19. The decision in Bharat Aluminium (supra) was applied prospectively to arbitration agreements concluded after the date of . However, the legal context in the present batch of matters is different. Article 265 of the Constitution prescribes that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law. The law must be valid in the sense that it must be within the legislative competence of the legislature and consistent with other provisions of the Constitution.32 Further, the power to levy tax is an incidence of sovereignty.33 If we are to give a prospective application to MADA (supra), it would result in a situation where the legislation enacted by the States in pursuance of their plenary powers under Entries 49 and 50 of List II may conceivably be invalidated based on a position of law which has been overruled.
