6. Prabhunath Singh (accused no.1) was avoiding the arrest, nor was he surrendering as he was the member of the ruling party. The District Magistrate, considering the amount of infl uence being yielded by the accused, found that it was not feasible to conduct the cases in District Saran at Chapra and hence recommended the transfer of all the six cases to Hazaribagh. In all these cases Prabhunath Singh was an accused. The transfer was approved by the High Court. However, later in the year 2000, upon re-organization of the State of Bihar, as Hazaribagh fell in the State of Jharkhand, the present trial was transferred to District Bhagalpur in Bihar. 7. It was only after 11 years that charges could be framed by the Trial Court on 26.03.2006 against all the accused for off ences under various Sections of IPC as stated above. The prosecution examined 11 witnesses. It would be relevant to note that out of these 11 witnesses, PW-1 to PW-7 were examined on a single day i.e. 27.06.2006. The statement of all these seven witnesses were more or less similar to the eff ect that they saw the incident of fi ring but did not see who killed the two deceased. All seven witnesses were declared hostile by the Prosecution. PW-8 to PW-10 (three witnesses) were examined on 10.08.2006. 8. In the meantime, on an application under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19732, the Trial Court, vide dated 23.10.2006,summoned Lalmuni Devi (CW-1), mother of deceased (Rajendra Rai) as court witnessand03.11.2006 was fi xed for recording her statement. On 24.10.2006, Lalmuni Devi (CW-1) and her husband were abducted from their residence by none other than the brother of Prabhunath Singh (accused no.1) and his associates. The appellant (son of CW-1) made a complaint to the local police and when no action was taken, he approached the Superintendent of Police of District Saran and also the Director General of Police and the State Home Secretary which also went unattended. This resulted into fi ling a petition seeking a writ of Habeas Corpus before the Patna High Court. 9. The said Habeas Corpus Petition was registered as Cr.WJC No. 717 of 2006, Harendra Rai Versus State of Biharand Others. 10. The said Habeas Corpus Petition was decided by the Division Bench of the Patna High Court vide the detailed dated 13.03.2007. 2 CrPC 412 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. The Division Bench issued certain directions with respect to the trial in question. The said judgement would be dealt with in detail at a later stage. 11. Pursuant to the direction issued vide dated 13.03.2007, the trial proceeded but again in a most shabby manner, not even complying with the directions of the High Court. The Special Public Prosecutor for the State, instead of getting the witnesses examined before the Court, fi led affi davits on their behalf reiterating their earlier statements. Only two witnesses were re-examined namely PW-1 and PW-10. With respect to PW- 2, PW-4 to PW-7, affi davits were fi led stating that they had nothing further to add and they reiterated their deposition given earlier.
