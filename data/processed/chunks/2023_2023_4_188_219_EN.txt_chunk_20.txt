It is important to separate the grain from the chaff and to reject a spurious defence which is mere bluster. However, in doing so, the Court does not need to be satisfied D that the defence is likely to succeed. The Court does not at this stage examine the merits of the dispute except to the extent indicated above. So long as a dispute truly exists in fact and is not spurious, hypothetical or illusory, the adjudicating Authority has to reject the application.” E (emphasis supplied) 33. In the light of the positions thus settled by this Court in Macquarie Bank Limited (supra) and Mobilox Innovations (P) Ltd. (supra), we will examine the question whether there was a ‘pre-existing dispute’ between the parties, warranting dismissal of the application for F initiation of CIRP filed by the appellant. 34. In this context, it is relevant to note that the Annexure A-41 demand notice under Section 8, IBC was issued by the appellant on 01.04.2017 and the respondent replied the same as per letter Annexure A-42 letter dated 10.04.2017 viz., within 10 days from the date of receipt G of Annexure A-41. Evidently, the respondent, in Annexure A-42 reply raised the contentions that there was shortfall in gas supply and that it had suffered huge loss due to the disconnection of gas supply. True that, in terms of the decision in Mobilox Innovations (P) Ltd. (supra) what is to be looked into is the existence or otherwise of a dispute and/or the suit or arbitration proceedings prior to the receipt of demand notice or H SABARMATI GAS LIMITED v. SHAH ALLOYS LIMITED 215 [C. T. RAVIKUMAR, J.] invoice, as the case may be. In the case on hand, as noticed earlier, the A appellant had issued a demand notice under Section 8, IBC read with the Rule 5 of 2016 Rules on 01.04.2017. Obviously, the NCLT and NCLAT referred to a letter dated 04.01.2013 (Annexure A-36 herein) to hold that existence of a pre-existing dispute between the parties revealed from the same. The said letter dated 04.01.2013 issued by way of a B reply by the respondent to the letter from the appellant dated 03.01.2013, reads thus:- “Date : 04.01.2013 To, C The Director, Sabarmati Gas Ltd., Gandhinagar.
