On the other hand, countries like the United Kingdom62 and Singapore63 have expressly rejected the doctrine and have emphasised the fundamentality of separate legal personalities of members within the same group. v. Some jurisdictions, such as Switzerland64 and the USA,65 have not accepted the Group of Companies doctrine in those terms. However, they invoke other legal principles to hold a non- signatory to be a party to the arbitration agreement (such as conduct, implied consent, contractual and agency principles). vi. American courts also solely rely on equity considerations (non- consensual) to hold a non-signatory to be party, such as when they apply equitable estoppel and veil piercing/alter ego.66 ii. Indian Precedents on the Group of Companies Doctrine 34. I will now consider the application of the Group of Companies doctrine by our courts and formulate principles that arise from the precedents. 60 Dow Chemical (supra). 61 Dallah Real Estate (supra) [Paris Cour d’Appel]; Malakoff Corporation (supra). 62 Peterson Farms (supra). 63 Manuchar Steel (supra). 64 X._____ et al v.

I am in agreement with the detailed analysis of the Indian case-law on this doctrine by the learned Chief Justice. The position of law in India can broadly be divided as it existed before and after the decision in Chloro Controls (supra). I have already referred to the decisions interpreting and applying Section 7(4)(b) in Part B(ii) of my opinion. The decisions cited therein recognise the possibility of a non-signatory company being a party to the arbitration. I have also referred to the reasoning in those decisions where the Court has examined the record of the agreement and constructed the existence of an arbitration agreement based on the express language, coupled with the consent of the parties. 36. Two decisions of this Court which preceded Chloro Controls (supra), namely, Sukanya Holdings67 and Indowind Energy68 were based on a strict interpretation of Section 7 and considered that parties to an agreement are limited to its signatories. 37. There was a defi nitive shift in this position from the case of Chloro Controls v. Severen Trent (supra). Arising out of the conspectus of a multi- party multi-contractual dispute, a petition for reference to arbitration under Section 45 of the Act was fi led in a suit, despite asymmetry in the parties to the contracts and the parties to the arbitration agreement. Interpreting the words and phrases “any person”, “claiming through or under”, and “shall” in Section 45 of the Court, this Court enlarged the scope of reference for the fi rst time, to bind non-signatories. 38. It noted that if a claim is made against or by someone who is not originally a signatory to an arbitration agreement, the Group of Companies doctrine can bind the “non-signatory affi liates or sister or parent concerns” to arbitration, “if the circumstances demonstrate that the mutual intention of all the parties was to bind both the signatories and the non-signatory affi liates.”69 The Court noted in the following words: “72.
