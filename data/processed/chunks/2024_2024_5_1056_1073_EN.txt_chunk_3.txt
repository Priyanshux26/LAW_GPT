10. The High Court went on to uphold the finding of the Special Judge, NIA on the question of authorization or empowerment as required under Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989, after satisfying itself with the answer given by the officer concerned, who was physically present before it. 11. Incidentally, for the remaining offences for which cognizance was taken, the High Court remitted the case to the Special Judge, NIA for its satisfaction before deciding to take cognizance for the offences punishable under Sections 306 and 411 of RPC, 1989 and Section 39 of UAPA, 1967. Insofar as this issue is concerned, due exercise has already been undertaken by the Special Judge, [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1061 National Investigation Agency New Delhi v. Owais Amin @ Cherry & Ors.

For the sake of convenience, we have extracted the relevant provisions contained in CrPC, 1989 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter referred to as “CrPC, 1898”): Section 4 of the CrPC, 1989 “4.
