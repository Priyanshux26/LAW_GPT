Two E of the thirteen accused namely Dhajen Phukan and Muhiram Phukan remained absconded and there is no material on record regarding their arrest or trial. 3. The prosecution story begins with lodging of a First Information Report2 on 13 June, 1989 at Police Station Chabua, District Dibrugarh, reported by Smt. Nareswari Phukan (PW1). It is a very short and crisp F FIR which states that around 12 noon on 13.06.1989, thirteen residents of the village came to her house, cordoned off her house without any reason and caused grievous injury on the head of her brother-in-law Robi Phukan (PW 2) by giving blows with sharp weapons and three of the accused persons, namely, Mozen Phukan, Dulen Phukan and Haren G Saikia committed murder of Pradip Phukan by assaulting him with sharp cutting weapons, necessary action may be taken regarding the said incident. This was registered as Chabua Case No.70/89 under Sections 1 IPC 2 FIR H 622 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 147/148,149,447, 302, 326, 34 IPC. The police came to the spot, made the necessary enquiries and after completing the formalities sent the dead-body of the deceased for post-mortem. They also collected some material from the spot for which recovery memos were prepared and the material taken into custody. After completing the investigation, charge- sheet was submitted on 3rd May, 1991 against eight accused, namely, B Mozen Phukan, Mridul Saikia, Kuleshwar Chetia, Pulen Phukan, Baren Saikia, Dulen Phukan, Kiran Saikia and Harnath Saikia. Five accused could not be arrested as such they were not sent for trial being absconders, namely, Jiten Phukan, Dhajen Phukan, Muhiram Phukarn, Haren Saikia and Jiban Chetia.
