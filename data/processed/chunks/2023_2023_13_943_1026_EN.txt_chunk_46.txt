We also looked into a very lucid and erudite judgement on the issue of unconscionable pre-condition in the arbitration agreement delivered 100 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. by a 9 Judge Bench of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Uber Technologies v. Heller (supra). 96. In the aforesaid case, Mr. Heller (driver) was required to accept the terms of Uber’s standard form service agreement, which stipulated that to resolve any dispute through arbitration or mediation with Uber, the claimant would have to pay an up-front administrative and fi ling fee of USD 14,500. 97. The Supreme Court of Canada held the aforesaid pre-condition to be unconscionable and unenforceable by a majority of 8:1. The majority speaking through Abella and Rowe JJ., while explaining the doctrine of unconscionability held as under: “53. We agree with Mr. Heller that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable. The parties and interveners focused their submissions on unconscionability in accordance with this Court›s direction in TELUS Communications Inc. v. Wellman, [2019] 2 SCR 144, at para. 85, that “arguments over any potential unfairness resulting from the enforcement of arbitration clauses contained in standard form contracts are better dealt with directly through the doctrine of unconscionability”. 54. Unconscionability is an equitable doctrine that is used to set aside “unfair agreements [that] resulted from an inequality of bargaining power” (John D. McCamus, The Law of Contracts (2nd ed. 2012), at p. 424). Initially applied to protect young heirs and the “poor and ignorant” from one-sided agreements, unconscionability evolved to cover any contract with the combination of inequality of bargaining power and improvidence (Mitchell McInnes, The Canadian Law of Unjust Enrichment and Restitution (2014), at p. 521; see also pp. 520- 24; Bradley E. Crawford, “Restitution — Unconscionable Transaction — Undue Advantage Taken of Inequality Between Parties” (1966) 44 Can. Bar Rev. 142, at p. 143). This development has been described as “one of the signal accomplishments of modern contract law, representing a renaissance in the doctrinal treatment of contractual fairness” (Peter Benson, Justice in Transactions : A Theory of Contract Law (2019), at p. 165; see also Angela Swan, Jakub Adamski and Annie Y. Na, Canadian Contract Law (4th ed. 2018), at p. 925). LOMBARDI ENGINEERING LTD. v. UTTARAKHAND JAL 1009 VIDYUT NIGAM LTD. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] 55. Unconscionability is widely accepted in Canadian contract law, but some questions remain about the content of the doctrine, and it has been applied inconsistently by the lower courts (see, among others, Morrison v. Coast Finance Ltd., (1965) 55 DLR 710 (2d) (B.C.C.A. ); Harry v. Kreutziger, (1978) 9 B.C.L.R. 166 (C.A. ), at p. 177, per Lambert J.A. ; Downer v. Pitcher, 2017 NLCA 13 : 409 DLR 542 (4th), at para. 20; Input Capital Corp. v. Gustafson, 2019 SKCA 78 : 438 DLR 387 (4th); Cain v. Clarica Life Insurance Co., 2005 ABCA 437 : 263 DLR 368 (4th); Titus v. William F. Cooke Enterprises Inc., 2007 ONCA 573 : 284 DLR 734 (4th); Birch v. Union of Taxation Employees, Local 70030, 2008 ONCA 809 : 305 DLR 64 (4th); see also Swan, Adamski and Na, at p. 982; McInnes, at pp.
