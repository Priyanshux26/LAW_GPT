Article 8 is an independent and distinct source of citizenship. 7. It was submitted that Pranav’s grandparents were born in the State of Tamil Nadu, which was part of undivided India before 15th August 1947. His maternal grandparents were also born in the undivided India before independence. Therefore, under Article 8, Pranav qualified to become an Indian citizen. It is submitted that the failure of the Union of India to recognise and enforce a constitutional provision is an arbitrary exercise of power. The learned senior counsel relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Anoop Baranwal v. Union [2024] 10 S.C.R. 741 Union of India v. Pranav Srinivasan of India [Election Commission Appointments]1 in the context of the right to vote. He also relied upon another decision in the case of Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community & Another. v. State of Maharashtra & Anr.,2 wherein this Court held that the role of the constitutional Courts is to interpret the Constitution, considering the changing needs of the society. 8. The learned senior counsel submitted that, independently of the constitutional provisions, Pranav is entitled to be registered as an Indian citizen under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act. He submitted that Pranav is a person of Indian origin as his parents were born within the territory of India after independence. He submitted that a common sense of interpretation would have to be given to the phrase “in such other territory which became part of India after the 15th day of August 1947,” occurring in Explanation-2 to Section 5 of the 1955 Act. Therefore, it includes all those territories which were part of the undivided India and continued to be a part of the independent India. He submitted that if the interpretation put to the said provision by the Union of India is accepted, persons whose parents were born in the States like Goa and Sikkim would be the persons of Indian origin but who are born in the territories which continued to be a part of India after independence, would be denied the same benefit. Therefore, a person of Indian origin can acquire Indian citizenship if it is shown that the grandparents were born in the undivided India and the parents were born in India after its independence. 9. He submitted that the words “minor child”, occurring in Section 8(2) of the 1955 Act, will include an unborn child or a child in the womb. He submitted that Section 3 of the 1955 Act talks about the acquisition of citizenship by birth, whereas Section 8(2) of the 1955 Act talks about a minor child. Therefore, a child need not have been born in India to be entitled to the benefit of seeking resumption of Indian citizenship under Section 8(2) of the 1955 Act. 10. Mr K M Nataraj, the learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG) appearing for the Union of India, submitted that Articles 5 to 9 of the Constitution of India determine who the Indian citizens were 1 [2023] 9 SCR 1 : (2023) 6 SCC 161 2 [2023] 1 SCR 293 : (2023) 4 SCC 541 742 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
