The Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC or Article 226 of the Constitution need not restrict itself only to the stage of a case but is empowered to take into account the overall circumstances leading to the initiation/ registration of the case as well as the materials collected in the course of investigation. Take for instance the case 3 (Criminal Appeal No. 2341 of 2023) [2024] 2 S.C.R. 257 Mamidi Anil Kumar Reddy v. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr. on hand. Multiple FIRs have been registered over a period of time. It is in the background of such circumstances the registration of multiple FIRs assumes importance, thereby attracting the issue of wreaking vengeance out of private or personal grudge as alleged.” 17. Considering the dicta in Mahmood Ali (supra), we find that the High Court in this case has failed to exercise due care and has mechanically permitted the criminal proceedings to continue despite specifically finding that the allegations are general and omnibus in nature. The Appellants herein approached the High Court on inter alia grounds that the proceedings were re-initiated on vexatious grounds and even highlighted the commencement of divorce proceedings by Respondent No. 2. In these peculiar circumstances, the High Court had a duty to consider the allegations with great care and circumspection so as to protect against the danger of unjust prosecution. 18. As stated above, given the facts and circumstances of the case, we find that the material on record is wholly insufficient to proceed against the Appellants. Accordingly, the Impugned s and the Docket dated 20.07.2021 are set aside and the criminal proceedings against the Appellants are consequently quashed. 19. Resultantly, the appeals stand allowed. 20. Pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeals allowed.
