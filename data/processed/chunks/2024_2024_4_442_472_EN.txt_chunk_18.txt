Najmunisha v. The State of Gujarat of the commission of such offence or any illegally acquired property or any document or other article which may furnish evidence of holding any illegally acquired property which is liable for seizure or freezing or forfeiture under Chapter VA of this Act is kept or concealed in any building, conveyance or place, may authorise any officer subordinate to him but superior in rank to a peon, sepoy or a constable to arrest such a person or search a building, conveyance or place whether by day or by night or himself arrest such a person or search a building, conveyance or place. (3) The officer to whom a warrant under sub-section (1) is addressed and the officer who authorised the arrest or search or the officer who is so authorised under sub-section (2) shall have all the powers of an officer acting under section 42.” 41. In the instant case, we are primarily affected by virtue of the jurisprudence of Section 41(2) of the NDPS Act 1985, which begins from the power of search and seizure conferred by the State upon its executive or administrative arms for the protection of social security in any civilized nation. Such power is inherently limited by the recognition of fundamental rights by the Constitution as well as statutory limitations. At the same time, it is not legitimate to assume that Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India would be affected by the provisions of search and seizure. It is a settled law that the statutory provisions conferring authorities with the power to search and seize are a mere temporary interference with the right of the accused as they stand well regulated by reasonable restrictions emanating from the statutory provisions itself. Thence, such a power cannot be considered as a violation of any fundamental rights of the person concerned. The same is iterated in MP Sharma v. Satish Chandra Sharma, District Magistrate, Delhi 1954 SCR 1077. 42. In light of the aforementioned constitutional backdrop, provisions of general search warrants and seizure were incorporated for the first time in Code of Criminal Procedure, 1882, thereupon, in Sections 96, 97, 98, 102, 103, 105, 165 and 550 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and presently, in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 under Sections 93, 94, 100, 102, 103 and 165. Upon perusal 468 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of Section 41(1) of the NDPS Act 1985, it is evident that the said provision empowers a Magistrate to issue search warrant for the arrest of any person or for search, whom he has reason to believe to have committed any offence under the provisions of the NDPS Act 1985. Section 41(2) of the NDPS Act 1985 further enables a Gazetted Officer, so empowered in this regard by the Central Government or the State Government, to arrest or conduct a search or authorize an officer subordinate to him to do so, provided that such subordinate officer is superior to the rank of a peon, sepoy or constable.
