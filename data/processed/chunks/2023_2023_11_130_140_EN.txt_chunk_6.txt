Although the presumption is rebuttable, a heavy burden lies on him who seeks to deprive the relationship of legal origin. Law leans in favour of legitimacy and frowns upon bastardy…..” 15. In S.P.S. Balasubramanyam v. Suruttayan alias Andali Padayachi and Others30, this Court held as under: “4. What has been settled by this Court is that if a man and woman live together for long years as husband and wife then a presumption arises in law of legality of marriage existing between the two. But the presumption is rebuttable (see Gokal Chand v. Parvin Kumari31). 28 1929 SCC OnLine PC 21 29 (1978) 3 SCC 527 30 (1994) 1 SCC 460 31 (1952) 1 SCC 713 SMT. SHIRAMABAI v. CAPTAIN, RECORD OFFICER SENA 139 CORPS ABHILEKH, GAYA, BIHAR STATE [HIMA KOHLI, J.] 16. It is true that there would be a presumption in favour of the wedlock if the partners lived together for a long spell as husband and wife, but, the said presumption is rebuttable though heavy onus is placed on the one who seeks to deprive the relationship of its legal origin to prove that no marriage had taken place (refer: Tulsa and Others v. Durghatiya and Others32). 17. A similar view has been taken by this Court in Madan Mohan Singh and Others v. Rajni Kant and Another33, Indra Sarma v. V.K.V. Sarma (supra) and Dhannulal And Others v. Ganeshram And Another. 18. In the case of Gokal Chand v. Parvin Kumari alias Usha Rani (supra) this Court observed thus : “……Continuous cohabitation of man and woman as husband and wife and their treatment as such for a number of years may raise the presumption of marriage, but the presumption which may be drawn from long cohabitation is rebuttable and if there are circumstances which weaken and destroy that presumption, the court cannot ignore them.” 19. In Kattukandi Edathil Valsan’s Case (supra), citing the abovesaid decisions and relying on Section 114 of the Evidence Act, this Court held in the facts of the said case that there was a presumption of the marriage between the parents of the plaintiff s on the ground of their long cohabitation status, entitling their off spring to claim their share in the suit schedule property. 20. It can be discerned from the aforesaid line of decisions that the law infers a presumption in favour of a marriage when a man and woman have continuously cohabitated for a long spell. No doubt, the said presumption is rebuttable and can be rebutted by leading unimpeachable evidence. When there is any circumstance that weakens such a presumption, courts ought not to ignore the same. The burden lies heavily on the party who seeks to question the cohabitation and to deprive the relationship of a legal sanctity. 21. In the instant case, if the period upto the year 1990 was to be excluded as the marriage between Late Subedar Bhave and Anusuya had got dissolved only on 15th November, 1990, fact remains that even thereafter, the 32 (2008) 4 SCC 520 33 (2010) 9 SCC 209 140 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R.
