It is seen from record that the accepting the voluntary retirement was passed on 18.09.2013 prior to the said clarification. At this stage, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Railways submits that the Circular dated 12.11.2014 is a clarificatory in nature, therefore, it will be applicable to the date of the main Circular but we are not impressed by the said submission, in particularly the prayer made by the petitioner in the application dated 18.06.2013 which was composite, i.e., for voluntary retirement and to grant compassionate appointment to his son. The Department accepted the prayer of voluntary retirement prior to issue of the clarification. 154 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. In view of the above, we thought it appropriate to give one chance to the respondent to decide the claim of the petitioner for grant of compassionate appointment expeditiously in view of the above observations. We direct the authorities to do the needful within four weeks and file an affidavit on or before the next date of hearing. List the matter on 21st November, 2023.” As per the above observations, this Court was clearly of the view that one chance ought to be given to the authorities to decide the application afresh filed for composite relief by the appellant asking voluntarily retirement subject to appointment of his son. However, the claim of the appellant has again been rejected vide dated 10.11.2023. The operative portion of the said is reproduced as thus: “Compassionate appointment on medical grounds is considered where employee is either totally incapacitated for continuation in job or medically decategorized i.e. unfit in one medical category but fit in another lower medical category. Time and again, Board has clarified that the concept of extending compassionate appointment is not applicable in a case where an employee is unfit in a medical category for a particular job but fit in the same medical category for other job. Thus, an employee is considered medically decategorized only when he is unfit for his original category and post but fit for posts with lower medical category i.e. where change in medical category is taking place. In this regard, Board’s letter No. L.No.E(NG)II/2009/RC1/CR/2 dated 03.03.2009 has also been perused which is much prior to the same clarification reiterated by Board vide L.N. E(NG)II/2009/RC1/CR/2 dated 12.11.2014. In the light of the above clarification of Board issued vide letter dated 03.03.2009, reiterated vide letter dated 12.11.2014, the matter is not considered fit for appointment on compassionate ground. The retired employee (Petitioner) may be advised accordingly.” In the extracted above, the respondent has again reiterated their understanding and relied upon the circular dated 12.11.2014. ASHOK KUMAR MEWARI v. UNION OF 1541 INDIA & OTHERS During hearing, Ms. Aishwarya Bhatti, learned ASG placed a letter of clarification dated 03.03.2009 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Railways. It is urged that the subsequent clarification dated 12.11.2014 is based on the said letter dated 03.03.2009, and contended that the request of the Appellant was subsequent to the Board letter dated 03.03.2009.
