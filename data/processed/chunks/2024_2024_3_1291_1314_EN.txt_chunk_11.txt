What had happened in Bellary, Chitradurga and Tumkur, has already been noticed by this Court in para 37 of the dated 18-4-2013 [Samaj Parivartana Samudaya v. State of Karnataka, (2013) 8 SCC 154] i.e. systematic, extraordinary and unprecedented plunder of the natural wealth and environment. This Court has specifically observed in para 37 that: (Samaj Parivartana case [Samaj Parivartana Samudaya v. State of Karnataka, (2013) 8 SCC 154] , SCC p. 187) 15 (2013) 8 SCC 213. 16 For short, “MIA”. 17 (2017) 5 SCC 434. 18 For short, “DPR”. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1309 Samaj Parivartana Samudaya & Ors. v. State of Karnataka & Ors. “37. … The situation being extraordinary the remedy, indeed, must also be extraordinary.” (emphasis supplied) It is to deal with such an extraordinary situation that the necessity of Cepmiz and implementation thereof by a special purpose vehicle out of funds in credit with the Monitoring Committee was contemplated. The special funds in deposit with the Monitoring Committee being the proceeds of illegal mining were meant to be deployed for re-creation of what had been lost due to such illegal activities. It is for the aforesaid purpose that Cepmiz was required to be drawn up and thereafter implemented. The state of implementation of the Scheme has not yet commenced. Funds in huge proportions would be necessary. A full and clear picture is yet to emerge. In a situation lessees who may be even remotely connected with the degradation and destruction of nature must continue to pay their share in the process of restitution by contributing to the Monitoring Committee from their present sale proceeds. Even the new lessees who may not have been involved with such degradation are contributing to the process of reclamation and restoration. In such a situation, we do not see how we can vary or modify our earlier s that require all existing lessees to pay 10% of the sale proceeds and/or to depart from the requirement of payment of what has been already ed, namely, 10% of the sale proceeds to the Monitoring Committee/SPV.” 87. The Court did not make comments on the CEPMIZ, except to state that insofar as socio-economic measures are concerned, different heads under which restoration and implementation work was proposed to be done, details thereof were to be worked out. It is to be noted that at that stage, funds to the extent of Rs.10,336 crores were available. 88. This aspect was again examined in the dated 21.03.2018 on an application filed by the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, Southern Region19 enclosing therewith reports of the CEC dated 19 For short, “FIMI, South”. 1310 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 19.03.2018. In this report, the CEC, with reference to the CEPMIZ, had suggested submission of a project report by KMERC indicating very broadly, different facets of the CEPMIZ, the work to be undertaken and the cost, which is reasonably expected to be incurred. Accordingly, this Court rejected the prayer made in the application, and stated that the same would be considered subsequently.
