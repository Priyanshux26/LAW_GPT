As observed hereinabove, the subject matter of suit was specific performance of the L.P.G. gas agreement and even the ad-interim injunction dated 18.05.1999 was also against the transfer of firm Ginni Enterprises to any other person and the defendants were directed to maintain status quo with respect to their F firm Ginni Enterprises. Therefore, at the time when the property in question was put to auction on 18.10.2011 the appellant had already purchased the said property as far as back on 31.08.1999 as there was no injunction with respect to the said property while ad-interim injunction dated 18.05.1999 and as observed hereinabove, the property in question was not the subject matter of suit and the decree came to be passed on G 30.09.1999 and the property was put to auction in the year 2011 for recovery of sum of Rs. 2,38,450/- + Rs. 23,500/- (sic). The ad- interim injunction dated 18.05.1999 cannot be pressed into service against the appellant. Therefore, the High Court has committed an error in considering injunction dated 18.05.1999 against the appellant. Therefore, at the time H 442 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A when the property was put to auction on 18.10.2011, the debtor was not the owner and therefore, the same could not have been put to auction. Under the circumstances, learned Executing Court erred in overruling the objections raised by the appellant against the auction/sale of the property which the appellant purchased much prior to the date of the auction i.e., on 31.08.1999. B 10. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned and passed by the High Court deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside and consequently the passed by the Executing Court overruling the objections raised by the appellant also deserves to be quashed and set C aside and is quashed and set aside. The passed by the lower Appellate Court is hereby restored. It will be open for respondent No. 1 to get back the amount deposited by him, lying with the Executing Court. Present appeal is accordingly allowed. In the facts and circumstance of the case there shall be no as to costs. D Bibhuti Bhushan Bose Appeal allowed.
