[Paras 15, 207] Constitution of India – Art. 14 – Writ petition challenging constitutionality of s.6A – Maintainability u/Art. 14: Held: (per Surya Kant, J.) (for himself and for M.M. Sundresh and Manoj Misra, JJ.) Art. 14 indicates that it confers individuals with equality before the law and is not restricted to mere equality for the benefits provided under law – Petitioner’s case that s.6A has singled out the State of Assam alone vis-à-vis other Indian States situated alongside the Bangladesh b and has curtailed the rights of only its original inhabitants – Petitioners’ assertion founded upon Art. 14 cannot be invalidated at a preliminary stage merely because they are seeking equality in regard to a restriction [2024] 10 S.C.R. 969 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 as opposed to a benefit – Thus, the objection regarding the maintainability of the petitioners’ claim u/Art. 14 rejected. [Paras 163, 164, 166] s.6A, if manifestly arbitrary Citizenship Act, 1955 – s.6A – Special provisions as to citizenship of persons covered by the Assam Accord – Constitution of India – Art. 14 – Manifest Arbitrariness – s.6A, if manifestly arbitrary – Plea that there is no rationale for the cut-off dates-01.01.1966 and 25.03.1971, thus, manifestly arbitrary; that the process envisaged u/s.6A and the Citizenship Rules, 2009 for the migrants unreasonable and suffers from the vice of ‘manifest arbitrariness’; that s.6A offends Part II of the Constitution; and that the term ‘ordinarily resident’ in s.6A undefined and vague: Held: (per Surya Kant, J.) (for himself and for M.M. Sundresh and Manoj Misra, JJ.) s.6A does not suffer from manifest arbitrariness because there is application of mind behind the incorporation of the cut-off dates; the process u/s.6A is not arbitrary; s.6A does not violate Part II of the Constitution; and the term ‘ordinary residence’ is not vague enough to be void – Cut- off dates in s.6A not incorporated in a vacuous manner but were result of considerable deliberation and discussion, and also backed by well-considered rationale which does not militates against any constitutional values or the concept of constitutional morality – Instead, s.6A acknowledged the political and social realities of that period along with the impracticability of reversing the changes that had occurred – There are legibly delineated conditions and reasonable process envisaged u/s.6A and the Citizenship Rules, 2009 for migrants who came before 01.01.1966, as well as those who came on or after 01.01.1966 and before 25.03.1971 – s.6A conferred citizenship only upon certain immigrants who met certain specified conditions up to a particular cut-off date – Its aim was not only to legitimize the stay of a particular class of immigrants but also to facilitate the detection and deportation of others. [Paras 232, 234, 238, 243, 245, 273] – Held: (per Pardiwala, J.) (Dissenting) s.6A suffers from the vice of manifest arbitrariness on account of the “systematic failure of the legislative vision – s.6A has acquired unconstitutionality subsequent to its enactment in 1985 by efflux of time and has thus become violative of Art.
