H M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 329 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] 147. We would proceed to elaborate and give further reasons: A 147.1. In Garware Wall Ropes Ltd. [Garware Wall Ropes Ltd. v. Coastal Marine Constructions & Engg. Ltd., (2019) 9 SCC 209 : (2019) 4 SCC (Civ) 324] , this Court had examined the question of stamp duty in an underlying contract with an arbitration clause and in the context had drawn a distinction between the B first and second part of Section 7(2) of the Arbitration Act, albeit the observations made and quoted above with reference to “existence” and “validity” of the arbitration agreement being apposite and extremely important, we would repeat the same by reproducing para 29 thereof : (SCC p. 238) C “29. This in Hyundai Engg. case [United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Hyundai Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd., (2018) 17 SCC 607 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 530] is important in that what was specifically under consideration was an arbitration clause which would get activated only if an insurer admits or accepts D liability. Since on facts it was found that the insurer repudiated the claim, though an arbitration clause did “exist”, so to speak, in the policy, it would not exist in law, as was held in that , when one important fact is introduced, namely, that the insurer has not admitted or accepted liability. Likewise, in the facts of the present case, it is clear that the arbitration clause that is contained E in the sub-contract would not “exist” as a matter of law until the sub-contract is duly stamped, as has been held by us above. The argument that Section 11(6-A) deals with “existence”, as opposed to Section 8, Section 16 and Section 45, which deal with “validity” of an arbitration agreement is answered by this Court’s F understanding of the expression “existence” in Hyundai Engg. case [United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Hyundai Engg. &Construction Co. Ltd., (2018) 17 SCC 607 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 530] , as followed by us.” Existence and validity are intertwined, and arbitration agreement G does not exist if it is illegal or does not satisfy mandatory legal requirements. Invalid agreement is no agreement.” 37. It is thereafter that in N.N. Global (supra), the Court doubted the correctness of the view taken in the aforesaid paragraphs and referred to the findings in paragraph-22 and 29 in Garware(supra), which stood H 330 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A affirmed in paragraphs-146 and 147 of Vidya Drolia (supra). We may notice that paragraph-147 of Vidya Drolia(supra) purported to give reasons in regard to what was stated in paragraph-146. Paragraph-147 is followed by paragraphs- 147.1 to 147.11. However, what, apparently, the Court in N.N. Global (supra) doubted, appears to be paragraphs- 146 and 147, which we understand in the context of this case, is to be B confined to paragraph-147.1. 38. We may resume survey of the Act to the extent it is relevant.
