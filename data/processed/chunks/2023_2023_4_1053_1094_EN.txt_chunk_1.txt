[Para 15][1088-F-G] 1.2. The subject land was allotted to the petitioner on D 05.08.2006 after acceptance of its offer of allotment of the said industrial plot by UPSIDC. Clause 14(a) of the allotment letter dated 05.08.2006 had been clear and unequivocal that land was allotted on 90 years lease basis. Further, it was provided in clause 10(b) of the allotment letter that tripartite lease deed of the built- E up premises would be executed where the allottee of the developer shall be the lessee; UPSIDC shall be the lessor; and the developer (the petitioner) shall be a confirming party. The lease deed dated 23.08.2006 in relation to 37208 sq. mtrs. of the allotted land carried the covenants, inter alia, that the lessee (the petitioner) will not, without the consent of lessor (UPSIDC), F transfer, sublet, relinquish, mortgage or assign its interest in the demised premises or in the buildings standing thereon with the other requirements [vide clause 3 (j)]. It was also stipulated that the allottee shall have to abide by the general terms and conditions of allotment of UPSIDC [vide clause 13]. It appears that in this G lease deed dated 23.08.2006, the stipulation regarding tripartite lease deed did not as such occur but the said clause 13 made all the general conditions of allotment binding on the petitioner. Moreover, in the other lease deed dated 30.03.2009 in relation to the adjacent plot of land, this stipulation was also inserted in H BHASIN INFOTECH AND INFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATE LTD. 1055 v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH clause 3(j). The Court is not entering into the questions relating A to tripartite lease deed in this matter but, this much is apparent on a comprehensive look at the terms of allotment and the covenants of lease deeds that the land was allotted to the petitioner on 90 years lease basis and further treatment of land and built-up portion thereupon were to abide by those terms and covenants. B It is also clear that possession of the entire parcel of land comprising the aforesaid two lease deeds, i.e., 40505 sq. mtrs., was handed over to petitioner on 31.03.2009 and on 08.10.2009, the building plan for construction over the aforesaid allotted land was sanctioned by respondent No. 2 whereafter construction over an area of 179017.82 sq. mtrs. was completed by the petitioner C for which, a partial completion certificate was issued by respondent No. 2 on 07.05.2011. Until all this time, there was nothing existing as regards the policy sought to be relied upon by the petitioner. [Para 15.1][1088-H; 1089-A-F] 1.3. The policy in question came up for the first time only D on 06.11.2013 and it was formulated essentially for growth of tourism sector in the State of Uttar Pradesh by setting up theme parks/amusement parks.
