It is submitted that though, in the matters of taxing Statutes, the legislature enjoys a very wide latitude, and the Courts are expected to show deference to legislative choices, a decision of this Court in the case of Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Association of India, etc. v. Union of India and Ors.5 holds that wide latitude is also subject to exceptions, it is argued that “wide latitude” does not mean “wild latitude”. On the twin test of reasonable classification, reliance was placed on various decisions, including those in the case of R.K Garg v. Union of India and Ors.,6 Twyford Tea Co. Ltd. and Anr. v. State of Kerala and Anr.,7 Union of India and Ors. v. Nitdip 3 [2015] 5 SCR 963 : (2015) 5 SCC 1 4 (2021) SCC OnLine SC 1006 5 [1989] 2 SCR 918 : (1989) 3 SCC 634 6 [1982] 1 SCR 947 : (1981) 4 SCC 675 7 [1970] 3 SCR 383 : (1970) 1 SCC 189 804 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Textile Processors Pvt. Ltd. and Anr..8 Varying standards of review under the doctrine of classification are typically applied to economic and non-economic legislation, with the rational basis test being applied to economic legislation. Various decisions were relied upon dealing with the wide latitude doctrine in relation to economic legislations. Reliance was placed on the Government of Andhra Pradesh and Ors. v. P. Laxmi Devi,9 Assistant Commissioner of Urban Land Tax and Ors. v. Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd., Etc.,10 Jindal Stainless Ltd. and Anr. v. State of Haryana and Ors.11 and State of Tamil Nadu and Anr. v. National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Association.12 The true import of the legislative provision is to be understood from the plain reading of the provision and not on the basis of affidavits or submissions of the State. A decision in the case of Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Company v. M/s Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. & Anr.13 is relied upon. 8. Assessees have submitted that clauses (c) and (d) and sub-section (5) of Section 17 must be read down to the extent that ITC is blocked for suppliers who procure taxable works contract services, goods or services on the input side and then provide taxable supplies on the output side. The submissions about reading down clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) of the CGST Act can be summarised as follows: a. The statement of objects and reasons of the Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill, 2014 shows that Articles 246A and 279A were introduced to simplify the indirect tax regime to prevent the cascading effect of multiplicity of taxes. The cascading effect of taxes can be removed only by introducing a system for allowance of ITC so that there would not be any missing link in the chain or series of transactions culminating into deliverable goods and services or both to the ultimate end-user, who is the customer. Reliance has been placed on the observations made by this 8 [2011] 13 SCR 26 : (2012) 1 SCC 226 9 [2008] 3 SCR 330 : (2008) 4 SCC 720 10 [1970] 1 SCR 268 : (1969) 2 SCC 55 11 [2016] 10 SCR 1 : (2017) 12 SCC 1 12 [2021] 7 SCR 479 : (2021) 15 SCC 534 13 [1983] 1 SCR 1000 : (1983) 1 SCC 147 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
