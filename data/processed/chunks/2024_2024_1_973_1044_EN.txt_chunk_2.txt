[Paras 66, 69, 70] Himachal Pradesh Town & Country Planning Act, 1977 – A reliance is placed on the case of Mantri Techzone Private Limited by respondent No.1 – Whether observations in Para 47 of the Mantri Techzone Private Limited would operate as res judicata: Held: In the said case the Advocate General of the State had specifically argued that the Revised Master Plan is statutory in nature and the NGT has no power, competence or jurisdiction to consider the validity or vires of any statutory provision/regulation – It was therefore argued that the of the NGT to that extent was liable to be set aside – It was similarly argued on behalf of the other appellant that the of the NGT impugned therein which revised buffer zones also had the effect of amending the Revised Master Plan 2015 – A perusal of para 29 of the Mantri Techzone Private Limited would clearly reveal that the counsel appearing for the applicants before the High Court has fairly conceded to the setting aside of those general directions – It could thus be seen that, though the issue was raised before the High Court with regard to the power of the NGT to issue such directions, the Supreme Court did not go into that issue on the basis of the concessions made by the appellants – Therefore, the observations found in para 47 of the Mantri Techzone Private Limited could not be construed to be a precedent or a ratio decidendi. [Para 76] Himachal Pradesh Town & Country Planning Act, 1977 – Whether the NGT was justified in passing the dated 14.10.2022 when the High Court was seized of the same issue during the pendency of Civil Writ Petition No.5960 of 2022: Held: The second of NGT ( dated 14.10.2022) arises out of publication of the draft development plan on 08.02.2022 – It was held that the draft development plan, being in conflict with the [2024] 1 S.C.R. 977 The State of Himachal Pradesh and Others v. Yogendera Mohan Sengupta and Another first (dated 16.11.2017) of NGT, was illegal and cannot be given effect to – The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India and others clearly holds that all Tribunals will act as the only Courts of first instance in respect of areas of law for which they have been constituted – It is a settled position of law that the High Courts exercise the power of judicial review over all the Tribunals which are situated within its jurisdiction – In view of the settled legal position, the continuation of the proceedings by the NGT during the pendency of the writ petitions before the High Court was not in conformity with the principles of judicial propriety – Needless to state that the High Court of Himachal Pradesh, insofar as its territorial jurisdiction is concerned, has supervisory jurisdiction over the NGT – Despite pendency of the proceedings before the High Court including the one challenging the interim dated 12.05.2022 passed by NGT, the NGT went ahead with the passing of the second dated 14.10.2022 impugned herein – The perusal of the s of the NGT itself reveal that though the NGT was informed about the High Court being in seisin of the proceedings, it went on to hold that the given by it was binding and therefore, the draft development plan, which in its view, was not in conformity with its , was liable to be set aside – The NGT ought not to have continued with the proceedings after the High Court was in seisin of the matter and specifically when it was informed about the same – That apart, the second of NGT (dated 14.10.2022) is passed basically on the basis of the first of NGT (dated 16.11.2017) – Since, the first of NGT itself to be not tenable in law, the second of NGT which is solely based on the first of NGT, is liable to be set aside.
