The period of subsistence of interim s passed by court has to be excluded in the computation of five years. 366.9. Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of concluded E proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of enforcement of the 2013 Act i.e. 1-1-2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of F compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.” 18. It is the undisputed fact on the record, as has been noticed in the impugned s passed by the High Court in the aforesaid Civil Appeals, the possession of the land was taken over by the Land G Acquisition Collector and handed over to Delhi Development Authority. Hence, one of the conditions being satisfied, we need not examine any other argument. 19. Keeping in view the aforesaid fact and the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Indore Development Authority’s H DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. SURENDER SINGH & 353 ORS. [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] case (supra), in our opinion the s passed by the High Court cannot A be legally sustained and the same are accordingly set aside. The appeals are allowed. The writ petitions filed by the respondents before the High Court are ed to be dismissed. B Nidhi Jain Appeals allowed. (Assisted by : Shraddha Singh, LCRA) C D E F G H
