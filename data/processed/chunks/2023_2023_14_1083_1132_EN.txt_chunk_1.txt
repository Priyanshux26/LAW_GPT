[Para 96] Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 – s.11 – Interpretation of – Plea of the Union that s.11 requires localized surveys by local bodies and not a national survey: Held: 2013 Act is not a regular statute, it is emancipatory in character and is a manifestation of the constitutional code of upliftment – The groundbreaking purpose of the 2013 Act is to ensure that manual scavengers are rehabilitated – Rehabilitation is a step after identifi cation – Without a survey, rehabilitation is not workable – The statutory scheme cannot be undermined through an interpretation that would leave the implementation of the 2013 Act solely with the local bodies, without any guidance from the Governments, State and Central – The Central and State Governments were and are, duty-bound to lay down the parameters under which a local body was mandated to conduct a survey – While the methodology of the Survey DR. BALRAM SINGH v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 1085 is provided under the 2013 Rules, the trigger for conducting the Survey is conspicuously absent from both the 2013 Rules as well as the 2013 Act – The absence of a trigger cannot render the 2013 Act and its constitutional commitments otiose by non-implementation – Local bodies must be guided by the central and state governments by laying down guidelines on when a survey must be conducted, and which local bodies must conduct a survey – Without a policy of this nature, a local body cannot be expected to implement the 2013 Act in a proper manner – while local governments must conduct surveys, it was for the appropriate authorities, at both the central and state levels, to lay down parameters for the surveys to be conducted – Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Rules, 2013 – Constitution of India – Article 17 – Civil Rights Act, 1955. [Paras 53, 54 and 56] Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 – s.11 – Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Rules, 2013 – r.11 – Insuffi ciency of the previous Surveys: Held: Neither the 2013 nor the 2018 surveys could have been conducted as prescribed under the scheme of the 2013 Rules and the 2013 Act for the reason that the institutions entrusted with duties to conduct the Surveys were either not constituted or were not functioning – Where the Act and Rules prescribe a particular method and manner of survey, that method and manner only ought to have been followed and no other method or manner could have been followed – No provisional list u/s.11(4) was prepared; no objections were called for and decided u/s.11(5) and no fi nal list was published u/s.11(6) – In the absence of following, the contention that there was a valid survey conducted cannot be accepted – Also, this Court in Safai Karamchari Andolan case had noticed the short-comings of the survey of 2013 – Hence, when this Court had already found that the survey was insuffi cient, the Union cannot possibly rely on the same survey once again.
