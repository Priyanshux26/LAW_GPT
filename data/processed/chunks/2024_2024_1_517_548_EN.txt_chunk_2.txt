[Para 18] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Jurisdiction – Essence of: Held: The essence really is that a court must not only have the jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter of dispute for the purpose of entertaining and trying the claim but also the jurisdiction to grant relief that is sought for – Once it is conceded that the jurisdiction on both counts is available, it is immaterial if jurisdiction is exercised erroneously – An erroneous decision cannot be labelled as having been passed ‘without jurisdiction’ – It is, therefore, imperative that the distinction between a decision lacking in inherent jurisdiction and a decision which suffers from an error committed in the exercise of jurisdiction is borne in mind.
