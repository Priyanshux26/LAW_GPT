Just as under the A.P. Act where the defi nition of a “teacher” contained in Section 2(n) was an expansive one and extended not only to those persons who impart instructions, conduct and carry on research work for extension programme, but also those who were declared to be a teacher within the purview of the defi nition under the Statute framed by the State Government, same is the position under the J.N.K.V.V. Act, the Statute and relevant Regulations. We are therefore of the opinion that the Division Bench of the High Court fell into an error by placing reliance on the decision in Ramesh Chandra Bajpai (supra), where the issue involved was at variance. 12. In view of the aforesaid discussion, it is deemed appropriate to quash and set aside the impugned dated 14th December, 2009 and restore the dated 26th April, 2005 passed by the learned Single Judge. It is declared that the appellant, who was discharging the duties of a PTI/Sports Offi cer, would fall within the defi nition of a “teacher” and would have been entitled to be continued in service till completion of 62 years of age. As the appellant was prematurely retired by the respondents at the age of 60 years, it is held that he shall be entitled to all consequential and monetary benefi ts including, arrear of salary, etc., had he continued in service upto to the age of 62 years. The retiral benefi ts of the appellant shall also be computed on a presumption that his age of retirement was 62 years. The entire amount due and payable to the appellant shall be computed by the respondents and paid over to him along with a copy of the said computation within a period of six weeks from today. 13. The appeal is allowed on the aforesaid terms. However, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, there shall be no s as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Ankit Gyan
