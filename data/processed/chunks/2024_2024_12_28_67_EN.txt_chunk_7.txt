55-56, para 5 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 720] ). 12. If the principle of Manjusree case [K. Manjusree v. State of A.P. (2008) 3 SCC 512 at p. 524, para 27 : (2008) 1 SCC (L&S) 841] is applied strictly to the present case, the respondent High Court is bound to recruit 13 of the “best” candidates out of the 21 who applied irrespective of their performance in the examination held. In such cases, theoretically it is possible that candidates securing very low marks but higher than some other competing candidates may have to be appointed. In our opinion, application of the principle as laid down in Manjusree case [K. Manjusree v. State of A.P. (2008) 3 SCC 512 at p. 524, para 27 : (2008) 1 SCC (L&S) 841] without any further scrutiny would not be in the larger public interest or the goal of establishing an efficient administrative machinery. 13. This Court in State of Haryana v. Subash Chander Marwaha [(1974) 3 SCC 220 : 1973 SCC (L&S) 488] while dealing with the recruitment of Subordinate Judges of the Punjab Civil Services (Judicial Branch) had to deal with the situation where the relevant rule prescribed minimum qualifying marks. The recruitment was for filling up of 15 vacancies. 40 candidates secured the minimum qualifying marks (45%). Only 7 candidates who secured 55% and above marks were appointed and the remaining vacancies were kept unfilled. The decision of the State Government not to fill up the remaining vacancies in spite of the availability of candidates who secured the minimum qualifying marks was challenged. The State Government defended its decision not to fill up posts on the ground that the decision was taken to maintain the high standards of competence in judicial service. The High Court upheld the challenge and issued a mandamus. In appeal, this Court reversed and opined that the candidates securing minimum qualifying marks at an examination held for the purpose of recruitment into the service of the State have no legal right to be appointed. In the context, it was held: (Subash Chander Marwaha 40 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports case [(1974) 3 SCC 220 : 1973 SCC (L&S) 488] , SCC p. 227, para 12) “12. … In a case where appointments are made by selection from a number of eligible candidates it is open to the Government with a view to maintain high standards of competence to fix a score which is much higher than the one required for more (sic mere) eligibility.” 14. Unfortunately, the decision in Subash Chander Marwaha [(1974) 3 SCC 220 : 1973 SCC (L&S) 488] does not appear to have been brought to the notice of Their Lordships in Manjusree [K. Manjusree v. State of A.P. (2008) 3 SCC 512 at p. 524, para 27 : (2008) 1 SCC (L&S) 841]. This Court in Manjusree [K. Manjusree v. State of A.P. (2008) 3 SCC 512 at p. 524, para 27 : (2008) 1 SCC (L&S) 841] relied upon P.K.
