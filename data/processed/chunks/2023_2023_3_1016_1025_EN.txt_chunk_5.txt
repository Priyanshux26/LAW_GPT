It is also required to be noted that as such the time gap between the two notifications dated G 30.06.2005 and 5.3.2007 would be approximately one year nine months. However, it is required to be noted that the acquisition with respect to the land situated at villages Badh Malik and Pritampura came to be acquired initially vide notification dated 13.08.2004 and thereafter from time to time the notifications were issued and the lands came to be H acquired for different public purposes. HARYANA STATE INDUSTRIAL & INFRASTRUCTURE 1023 DEVELOPMENT CORP. LTD. v. SATPAL [M. R. SHAH, J.] At this stage, it is required to be noted that even while remanding A the matter to the High Court, this Court vide and dated 6.9.2017 specifically observed that if the land value is to be fixed for KMP project acquisition, the relevant factors which are to be noted are mainly the value that was prevalent in the locality prior to 13.08.2004. However, in the present case, the lands acquired are for the expansion B of industrial sector 39, Sonipat and therefore the amount of compensation assessed and determined for the land acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005 acquired of very villages Badh Malik, Pritampura and Rasoi can be said to be the governing factor even while determining the compensation for the land acquired vide notification dated 5.3.2007 as under both the notifications the lands acquired are for the same public C purpose, namely, development of industrial sector 39, Sonipat, Haryana. 6. Now so far as the land acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005 is concerned, the High Court has assessed and determined compensation @ Rs. 29,54,000/- per acre. While assessing and determining the compensation @ Rs. 29,54,000/- per acre for the land D acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005, the High Court has considered the sale deeds produced as Ex. P43 & P44. The High Court took into consideration the following sale deeds which are tabulated as under: E F G Thereafter, the High Court has observed that Ex. P43 & P44 would be safe sale exemplars to fall back upon and after applying the cut off of 50%, the High Court has assessed the compensation @ Rs. 29,54,000/- per acre. H 1024 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A 7. If we consider the main Ex. P43 & P44, which are the sale deeds dated 15.04.2005 and thereafter applying the cut off of 50%, the market value of the land would come to Rs. 24,43,693/- per acre. Instead, without any adequate reasons, the High Court has assessed and enhanced the amount of compensation @ Rs. 29,54,000/- per acre. Therefore, the High Court has committed a very serious error in assessing and B determining the compensation @ Rs. 29,54,000/- per acre for the land acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005. After making the round figure, the landowners/claimants shall be entitled to compensation @ Rs.24,50,000/- per acre with respect to the land acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005, with all other statutory benefits, which may be available C under the provisions of the 1894 Act.
