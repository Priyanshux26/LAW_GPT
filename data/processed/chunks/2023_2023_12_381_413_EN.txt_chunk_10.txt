It could, therefore, be taken that they were fully aware of the incriminating circumstances appearing against them in the prosecution evidence. Yet, they took no plea before the trial court or the High Court of any kind of prejudice caused to them. Thus, this plea, raised for the fi rst time before this Court, ought not be entertained. 15. In support of his submissions, the learned counsel for the State cited decisions on two broad propositions, namely, (a) Conviction with the aid of Section 34 of the I.P.C can be recorded for the role of exhortation. The decisions cited were: (i) Gulab v. State of Uttar Pradesh14; and (ii) Sandeep v. State of Haryana15 (b) Unless prejudice is shown to have been caused to the accused, failure to put any incriminating circumstance, by itself, would not vitiate the trial. The decisions cited were: (i) Nar Singh v. State of Haryana16; (ii) Alister Anthony Pareira v. State of Maharashtra17; and (iii) Satyavir Singh Rathi, ACP & Others v. State18. Discussion and Analysis 16. We have considered the rival submissions and have perused the record carefully. Before we deal with the submissions, it would be useful 14 (2022) 12 SCC 677 15 2021 SCC Online SC 642 16 (2015) 1 SCC 496 17 (2012) 2 SCC 648 18 (2011) 6 SCC 1 396 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. to recapitulate facts which have been found proved, and regarding which there is no serious dispute, namely, (a) The incident had its genesis in an altercation between two families i.e, Sri Krishan’s family on one side and Satpal’s family on the other.

(c) The gun which Babu Ram used to fi re shots was licensed to him. (d) Babu Ram was present at the time when altercation between the two sides took place. (e) Babu Ram is brother-in-law of Shri Krishan. (f) Babu Ram’s house opens on Street No. 400 whereas Satpal’s house opens on Street No.300. Though exact location of Shri Krishan’s house is not disclosed in the site plan prepared in connection with the case, however, from his address, which is disclosed as D-291, Jahangir Puri, Delhi, it appears that his house is near Satpal’s house (which is D-294), and on same Street No.300. 17.
