DR. BALRAM SINGH v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 1115 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] engaged in manual scavenging. For instance, the Petitioners, with their limited resources, have managed to identify 1098 persons in manual scavenging in the State of Bihar. The Progress Report dated 27.02.2014 claims to have identifi ed only 136. In the State of Rajasthan, the Petitioners have identifi ed 816 manual scavengers whereas the Progress Report of the State dated 27.02.2014 has identifi ed only 46. 11. The aforesaid data collected by the Petitioners makes it abundantly clear that the practice of manual scavenging continues unabated. Dry latrines continue to exist notwithstanding the fact that the 1993 Act was in force for nearly two decades. States have acted in denial of the 1993 Act and the constitutional mandate to abolish untouchability. 12. For over a decade, this Court issued various directions and sought for compliance from all the States and Union Territories. Due to eff ective intervention and directions of this Court, the Government of India brought an Act called “The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013” for abolition of this evil and for the welfare of manual scavengers. The Act got the assent of the President on 18.09.2013. The enactment of the aforesaid Act, in no way, neither dilutes the constitutional mandate of Article 17 nor does it condone the inaction on the part of Union and State Governments under the 1993 Act. What the 2013 Act does in addition is to expressly acknowledge Article 17 and Article 21 rights of the persons engaged in sewage cleaning and cleaning tanks as well persons cleaning human excreta on railway tracks.” 66. Hence, when this Court had already found that the survey was insuffi cient, the Union cannot possibly rely on the same survey once again. III: Institutions 67. A major short-coming in the implementation of the 2013 Act is the fact that the State and the Central Governments have not even constituted the institutions that are required to implement the Act. A list of institutions required to be constituted under the Act are under: 111 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. S. No. Institution Section/Rule 1. National Commission for Safai Section 3, National Commission Karamcharis for Safai Karamcharis Act, 1993; Given statutory functions under Section 31, 2013 Act. 2. State Commission for Safai Section 32, 2013 Act Karamcharis 3. Central Monitoring Committee Section 29, Prohibition Act, 2013 4. State Monitoring Committee Section 26, Prohibition Act, 2013 5. Vigilance Committees Section 24, Prohibition Act, 2013 6. State Level Survey Committee Rule 11, Prohibition Rules, 2013 7. District Level Survey Rule 11, Prohibition Rules, 2013 Committee 68. The implementation of the statute depends on the eff ective functioning of the aforementioned institutions. Unfortunately, it has been seen that these institutions have not been constituted by the States and the Union and where they have been constituted, the institutions are not functioning at all. The Act has created the institutions to ensure a check and balance on the implementation of the statute.
