THE FACTUAL PRISM: 5. An Agreement to Sell (hereinafter referred to as “ATS”) was executed in favour of the respondents by the appellants on 31.07.1975. The ATS envisioned that the appellants had to apply for permission to sell the property within eight days and upon permission being received, the same was to be intimated to the respondents and the Sale Deed was to be executed within 15 days from receipt of such intimation by the respondents. Earnest money of Rs.1,000/- was paid out of the total sale consideration of Rs.6,000/. The appellants did not apply for any permission to sell which led to the respondents fi ling Suit No. 5 of 1981 on 01.01.1981 for specifi c performance of the ATS. The suit was decreed by dated 08.03.1982. The appellants fi led Appeal No.118 of 1982 which was allowed by the First Appellate Court vide dated 09.05.1984. The respondents thereafter fi led Second Appeal No.1574 of 1984 which was allowed by the High Court on 02.04.2010. The appellants then carried the case to this Court, which remanded the matter to the High Court. On remand, the High Court again allowed the Second Appeal by its dated 18.07.2018, reversing the fi nding(s) of the First Appellate Court. The High Court’s dated 18.07.2018 is impugned herein. SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANTS: 6. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the Trial Court had totally mis-appreciated the facts and law while decreeing the suit. It was stated that the First Appellate Court, after appreciation of the facts in their correct perspective and applying the law to the same, rightly reversed 113 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. the Trial Court’s view, and dismissed the suit. It was contended that the High Court without giving any cogent reasons, on wrong appreciation of the material/facts and law, had reversed the of the First Appellate Court. Learned counsel submitted that our interference was called for. It was contended that the First Appellate Court had rightly come to the conclusion that in the background of the various clauses in the ATS, the respondents had not taken any steps despite the appellants not having applied for permission for fi ve years; which showed that the respondents were not ready and willing to perform their part of the contract, and therefore, the suit was barred by limitation.
