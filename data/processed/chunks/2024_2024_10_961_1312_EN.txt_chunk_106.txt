280. The Petitioners in the present case allege a violation of their right specifically under Article 29(1). This article aims to protect and guarantee the right conferred upon every citizen of India to conserve their language, script or culture. When read in conjunction with Article 30, the overarching objective of Article 29 is to allow minority communities to establish educational institutions to preserve and fortify their cultural, linguistic, or scriptural heritage. However, given the specific allegations presented by the Petitioners, our scrutiny will be confined exclusively to assessing a potential violation of Article 29(1). 183 Begum Aizaz Rasul, Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume 7, 08.12.1948. 184 Z. H. Lari, Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume 7, 08.12.1948. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1113 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 (b) Standing under Article 29(1) 281. Article 29(1) effectively has two key aspects that need to be determined: first, whether there is a ‘section of citizens’ seeking to conserve their language, script or culture and second, that such language, script or culture in question is ‘distinct’. 282. Article 29(1) begins with the term ‘any section of citizens’. Though the term ‘minority’ is used in the marginal heading, the scope of Article 29(1) is not restricted to minorities as understood in the technical sense.185 It instead extends to any section of citizens residing in the territory of India. This was a conscious choice on the part of the framers of our Constitution,186 as is apparent from the following words of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar: "For instance, for the purposes of this article 23, if a certain number of people from Madras came and settled in Bombay for certain purposes, they would be, although not a minority in the technical sense, cultural minorities. Similarly, if certain number of Maharashtrians went from Maharashtra and settled in Bengal, although they may not be minorities in the technical sense, they would be cultural and linguistic minorities in Bengal. The article intends to give protection in the matter of culture, language and script not only to a minority technically, but also to a minority in the wider sense of the terms as I have explained just now. That is the reason why we dropped the word “minority” because we felt that the word might be interpreted in the narrow sense of the term, when the intention of this House, when it passed article 18, was to use the word “minority” in a much wider sense, so as to give cultural protection to those who were technically not minorities but minorities nonetheless. It was felt that this protection was necessary for the simple reason that people who go from one province to another and settle there, do not settle there permanently. They do not uproot 185 Dr. B.R.
