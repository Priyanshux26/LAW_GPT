ANALYSIS 28. The High Court’s interpretation of Section 7 of the NI Act accurately identified the “drawer” as the individual who issues the cheque. This interpretation is fundamental to understanding the obligations and liabilities under Section 138 of the NI Act, which makes it clear that the drawer must ensure sufficient funds in their account at the time the cheque is presented. The appellants’ argument that directors or other individuals should also be liable under Section 143A misinterprets the statutory language and intent. The primary liability, as correctly observed by the High Court, rests on the drawer, emphasizing the drawer’s responsibility for maintaining sufficient funds. 29. The general rule against vicarious liability in criminal law underscores that individuals are not typically held criminally liable for acts committed by others unless specific statutory provisions extend such liability. Section 141 of the NI Act is one such provision, extending liability to the company’s officers for the dishonour of a cheque. The appellants’ attempt to extend this principle to Section 143A, to hold directors or other individuals personally liable for interim compensation, is unfounded. The High Court rightly emphasized that 10 [2009] 9 SCR 1144 : (2009) 10 SCC 48 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1223 Shri Gurudatta Sugars Marketing Pvt. Ltd. v. Prithviraj Sayajirao Deshmukh & Ors. liability under Section 141 arises from the conduct or omission of the individual involved, not merely their position within the company. 30. The distinction between legal entities and individuals acting as authorized signatories is crucial. Authorized signatories act on behalf of the company but do not assume the company’s legal identity. This principle, fundamental to corporate law, ensures that while authorized signatories can bind the company through their actions, they do not merge their legal status with that of the company. This distinction supports the High Court’s interpretation that the drawer under Section 143A refers specifically to the issuer of the cheque, not the authorized signatories. 31. The principle of statutory interpretation, particularly in relation to Sections 143A and 148, was also correctly applied by the High Court. The Court emphasized that when statutory language is clear and unambiguous, it should be given its natural and ordinary meaning. The legislative intent, as discerned from the plain language of the statute, aims to hold the drawer accountable. The appellants’ argument for a broader interpretation to include authorized signatories under Section 143A contradicts this principle and would lead to an unjust extension of liability not supported by the statutory text. 32. The High Court’s reliance on established legal precedents further reinforces its interpretation. Judicial precedents relied upon in the impugned underscore the need for a literal interpretation of the statutory provisions. These precedents support the High Court’s decision to limit the definition of ‘drawer’ to the issuer of the cheque, excluding authorized signatories. 33. The appellants’ reliance on the in Aneeta Hada (Supra),11 is misplaced and out of context. While this case underscored the necessity of involving the company as an accused to maintain a prosecution under Section 141, it does not support the extension of liability to authorized signatories under Section 143A.
