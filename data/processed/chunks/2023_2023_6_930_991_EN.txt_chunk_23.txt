A B C D 18. Article 134B of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 was the E predecessor provision holding the field till Article 96 supplanted it in the year 1963. The following table sets out Article 134B of the Limitation Act, 1908 and Article 96 of the Limitation Act, 1963: “Description of suit Period of Time from which limitation period begins to F run 134- By the manager of a Hindu, Muhammadan or Buddhist Twelve The death, B. religious or charitable endowment to recover possession years resignation or of immovable property comprised in the endowment removal of the which has been transferred by a previous manager for a transferor.” valuable consideration. Article 96 of the Limitation Act, 1963 G “Description of suit Period of Time from which period begins limitation to run 96. By the manager of a Hindu, Muslim or Twelve The date of death, resignation Buddhist religious or charitable endowment years or removal of the transferor or to recover possession of movable or the date of appointment of the immovable property comprised in the plaintiff as manager of the endowment which has been transferred by a endowment, whichever is previous manager for a valuable later.” consideration. H ” SABIR ALI KHAN v. SYED MOHD. AHMAD ALI KHAN AND 961 OTHERS [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] 19. The distinction between the two Articles have been noted by A the of this Court in T. Kaliamurthi and another v. Five Gori Thaikkal Wakf and others18. It reads as under: “35. ……We have carefully noted two Articles viz., Article 96 of the Limitation Act, 1963 and Article 134B of the Limitation Act, 1908 and we find that they are different from each other B insofar as while under the 1908 Act 12 years was to run from the death, resignation or removal of the transferor, under the 1963 Act the said period of 12 years was to run from the date of death, resignation or removal of the transferor, or the date of appointment of the plaintiff as Manager of the endowment, whichever was C later.” 20. As far as the first sale is concerned, the sale was not effected by the Mutawalli or the Manager of the Waqf. The sale was effected by the brother of the Mutawalli. Therefore, the High Court is correct in finding that Article 96 will not come to the aid of the appellant. D 21. As far as the second sale is concerned, it was no doubt, executed by the Mutawalli by sale deed 26.09.1974. This is a sale executed by him on the strength of the compromise which was entered into between the three brothers on 13.02.1974. As we have noticed, the compromise led to dated 12.09.1974 being passed by the Deputy Director E (Consolidation) setting aside the dismissal of the revision by dated 20.09.1969 as also the dismissal of the first restoration application dated 02.03.1972. If the said sale is found to be valid, then obviously, the appellant would fail. If on the other hand, the sale is void, the question would be whether the proceeding initiated beyond 12 years from the date of the sale would be within time.
