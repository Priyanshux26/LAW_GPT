f. Reliance placed by the High Court on Balraj Taneja v. Sunil Madan8 was misplaced in the present case as this Court, in Balraj Taneja (supra), while holding that reasons must be given while decreeing a suit under Rule 10 of VIII, CPC, was seized of a matter where the decree was challenged in appellate proceedings. In the present case, the decree was sought to be declared inexecutable in execution proceedings, far beyond the reach of such a narrow jurisdiction. 10. Ms. Preetika Dwivedi, learned counsel for the Purchasers (respondents 1 to 3) in support of upholding of the impugned , submitted as under: 6 (1995) 6 SCC 50 7 (2010) 11 SCC 557 8 (1999) 8 SCC 396 [2024] 1 S.C.R. 529 Asma Lateef & Anr. v. Shabbir Ahmad & Ors. a. The dated 5th August, 1991 passed by the Trial Court is not a within the scope of section 2(9) read with Rule 4 of XX, CPC and the principle of law laid down in Balraj Taneja (supra) was rightly applied by the High Court. b. The High Court had rightly granted all the parties liberty to have the title to the suit property adjudicated by the appropriate forum; hence, it could not be said that the appellants were prejudiced in any manner whatsoever. Further, any question relating to the title, and validity of the sale deed in favour of the Purchasers could be determined by the appropriate forum. c. At the time of purchase, the names of Kazmi’s sons, i.e. respondents 4 and 5, were present in the land revenue records pertaining to the suit property, after which the Purchasers’ names have been inserted through mutation. d. As per the law laid down in Hukam Chand v. Om Chand9 and Nagubai Ammal v. B. Shama Rao10, the transfer of the suit property was not in violation of section 52, ToP Act since the statute did not put an absolute embargo on the transfer of such property pendente lite. Analysis 11. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the impugned as well as the other materials on record. 12. The sole question of law which arises for a decision in this appeal is: Whether the dated 5th August, 1991 suffered from a jurisdictional error so grave that the decree drawn up subsequently is incapable of execution by the Executing Court and an objection that it is inexecutable was available to be raised under section 47, CPC by the respondents 1 to 3? 13. Prior to answering the above question, we consider it appropriate to examine the scope and extent of power exercisable under Rule 10 of VIII, CPC. 9 (2001) 10 SCC 715 10 AIR 1956 SC 593 530 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 14. Rule 10 of VIII, CPC, used as the primary source of power by the Trial Court in passing the dated 5th August, 1991 against Samiullah, postulates the procedure that could be adopted when a party fails to present its written statement upon the same being called for by the court.
