In the cross-examination made by the public prosecutor, PW-7 accepted that she informed the police that she saw the appellant going down, and while going down, he was cleaning the blood off his clothes. However, in the cross-examination made by the advocate for the accused, she stated that except for seeing the deceased in injured condition, she had not seen anything else and that she was not aware of the persons who were involved in the incident. 13. The High Court held that the evidence of PW-9 Kalu Shaikh, another hostile witness, proves the appellant’s presence at the time of the incident. In cross-examination by the advocate for the accused, PW-9 stated that he did not know the appellant and the deceased before the incident. He stated that he was unable to identify the appellant. He stated that except for hearing the shouts “save, save,” he knew nothing. 14. Therefore, after having carefully perused the evidence of the hostile prosecution witnesses (PW-3 to PW-9), we find that there is nothing in the evidence which could be relied upon by the prosecution for connecting the appellant with the murder of the deceased. 15. Thus, the appellant’s conviction cannot be sustained for the above reasons. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The conviction and sentence of the appellant are set aside, and the appellant is acquitted of the offence alleged against him in Sessions Case No. 80 of 2005, decided by the 3rd Fast Track Court, Surat arising out of CR No. I/142/2004 of Limbayat Police Station. The appellant shall be set at liberty unless he is required to be detained in connection with any other case. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
