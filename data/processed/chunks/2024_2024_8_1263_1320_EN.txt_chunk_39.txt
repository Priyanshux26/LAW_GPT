Given the facts noted above, we shall refrain from cancelling the sale or declaring the Sale Deed as void. Instead, it is deemed appropriate to balance the equities by directing the Auction Purchaser to pay an additional amount in respect of the subject property. CONCLUSION 36.15 For arriving at a just and fair figure, we propose to take into consideration the estimated value of the subject property in terms of the Reports submitted by the Registered Valuers appointed by the Liquidator. Based on their Reports, the Liquidator had fixed ₹39,41,28,800/- (Rupees Thirty nine 56 [2008] 12 SCR 1 : (2008) 9 SCC 299 57 [2023] 13 SCR 53 : (2024) 2 SCC 1 58 [2022] 8 SCR 968 : (2022) 5 SCC 710 1320 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports crore forty one lakh twenty eight thousand and eight hundred only) as the average liquidation value of the subject property for the purpose of e-auction. This figure was brought down by 25% in the second round of auction which came to ₹29,55,96,375/- (Rupees Twenty nine crore fifty five lakh ninety six thousand three hundred and seventy five only). The difference in the two figures mentioned above comes to ₹10,00,00,000/- (Rupees Ten crore only) approximately. Keeping in mind the fact that the Auction Purchaser managed to retain the balance sale consideration for over six months reckoned from 10th February, 2020 and about five months reckoned from 25th March, 2020, we deem it appropriate to direct it to deposit 50% of the differential figure, i.e., an additional sum of ₹5,00,00,000/- (Rupees Five crore only) with the Liquidator along interest @ 9 % p.a. reckoned from 26th March, 2020 till date of actual payment. The said amount shall be deposited by the Auction Purchaser with the Liquidator within eight weeks from today. Thereafter, the Liquidator shall disburse the amount received in terms of the s passed/may be passed by the Adjudicating Authority, as contemplated under the IBC. 36.16 The appeals are partly allowed on the above terms. Parties shall bear their own expenses. Result of the case: Appeals Partly allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
