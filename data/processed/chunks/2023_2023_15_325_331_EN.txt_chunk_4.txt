(4) Any child of the parties to a marriage referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (2) born of such marriage shall be deemed to be their legitimate child: Provided that in a case falling under sub-clause (i) or sub-clause (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (3), such child was begotten before the date of the dissolution of the marriage or, as the case may be, before the date of the second of the marriages referred to in the said sub-clause (ii). ILAVARASAN v. THE SUPERITENDENT OF POLICE & 331 ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] India. This Court has emphasized in more than one decision {Lata Singh v. State of UP, (2006) 5 SCC 475, Shafi n Jahan v. Asokan KM, (2018) 16 SCC 368, and Laxmibai Chandaragi B. v. The State of Karnataka (2021) 3 SCC 360} the right of individuals to exercise free choice and that it is an intrinsic part of the right of life. It is, therefore, held that view expressed in S. Balakrishnan Pandiyan (Supra) is erroneous. The same is, accordingly, overruled in Nagalingam (supra). 9. The Court also notices the observations made by the impugned , with respect to the role of the advocates. The concerns voiced by the High Court are not entirely unfounded. Advocates or lawyers have many capacities- one being Offi cers of the Court. Therefore, they should not, while acting as counsel or advocates or their capacity as advocates, undertake or volunteer to solemnize marriages. That can well result in Advocates chambers or offi ces turning out to be matrimonial “establishment”- a consequence never intended- or perhaps never contemplated by law. However, in their capacity as friends or relatives of the intending spouses, their role as witnesses cannot be ruled out. 10. The appeal is allowed in the above terms. Pending applications, if any, are disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Nidhi Jain
