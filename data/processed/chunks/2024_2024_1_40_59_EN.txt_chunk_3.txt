STATE OF CHHATTISGARH There were first degree burn injuries on the body of the victim as the burnt area was 45% to 48% of his body. Statement of the victim (PW- 6) was recorded before a Nayab Tehsildar on 04.01.2013 at 12 noon. The overall circumstances under which this statement was recorded makes it an important piece of evidence. We must also remember that this is a statement given by an eighteen year old boy who has just come out of a harrowing incident where a dastardly attempt was made on his life. He is also grievously injured and apparently had consulted no one before giving this statement before an Executive Magistrate. The veracity of this statement should not be in doubt. He states how he was taken on a motorcycle by Neeraj Sharma and Ashwani Kumar Yadav and how he was asked to consume alcohol on the way and then at 1:00 AM in the night, how the two accused first tried to strangulate him with clutch wire and later set his body on fire, thinking he is dead. It is important here to note that there is no mention here of any demand or talk of ransom. 5.
