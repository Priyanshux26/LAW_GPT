Being aggrieved by the of the tribunal dated 06.11.2019 these appeals have been fi led. SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES 93. The thrust of the arguments canvassed by Mr. S.K Bagaria, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant/assessee is: the original authority had acted beyond the jurisdiction and travelled beyond the powers vested under Rule 6 of the CTPM Rules, 2010. He would also contend that the issue of classifi cation of a product cannot be the subject matter of adjudication in an passed under Rule 6(2) of CTPM Rules. He would contend that 628 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. when the issue of classifi cation of a product arises, the initial burden is on the Department/Revenue, and it can be contested by the assessee and thereafter the dispute is to be adjudicated by following the principles of natural justice. He has submitted that these aspects though urged before the tribunal, had been completely ignored and as such impugned s are required to be set aside by this Court. 94. He would elaborate his submissions by contending that the issue of classifi cation is an independent issue in itself and no decision on the classifi cation can be taken in a matter concerning the approval of declaration under Rule 6 of the CTPM Rules. He would also contend that the description of a product as declared under the declaration fi led under Rule 6 cannot be changed by the Revenue when the product has been sold and marketed under a particular heading. He would contend that under the CETA, there is no defi nition of ‘chewing tobacco’ and ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ and therefore the test lies in the market understanding of the product and the same would prevail. He would further contend that under Rule 6 of CTPM Rules, the authority would only consider the number of machines installed in the factory and production capacity of the same and it was not open to him to examine the correct classifi cation of the product. In support of his submissions, he has relied upon the following s: (i) ITC Ltd. v. Commissioner (2019) 17 SCC 46. (ii) HPL Chemicals Ltd. v. CCE, Chandigarh 2006 (197) ELT 324 [SC] (iii) Mauri Yeast India Pvt. Ltd. v. State of U.P. 2008 (225) ELT 321 [SC] (iv) CCE Nagpur v. Shree Baidyanath Ayurved Bhawan 2009 (237) ELT 225 [SC] (v) W.P.I.L. Ltd. v. CCE 2005 (181) ELT 359 [SC] (vi) Mathuram v. State of M.P.
