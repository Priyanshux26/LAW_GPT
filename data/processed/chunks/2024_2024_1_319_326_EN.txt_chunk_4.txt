Further argument of Mr.Agarwal that the informant moved the application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. on 29.09.2014 was a counter blast and with annoyance and vengeance as appellant had deposed against his father on the same day, has no legs to stand.

We may also place on record the fact that we are not threadbare discussing the testimony of the witness during the trial as it may ultimately influence the Trial Court at a later stage. We, further, make it clear that any observations made in this will not come in the way of the Trial Court in deciding the trial on its own merits on the basis of the evidence adduced before it, completely uninfluenced by this .
