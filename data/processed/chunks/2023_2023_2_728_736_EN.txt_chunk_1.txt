H 730 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A 3. This issue is no longer res integra as the contours and import of the Act of 2007, including the question aforestated, were dealt with and decided by a Constitution Bench in Modern Dental College and Research Centre and others Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and others[(2016) 7 SCC 353]. However, failure of the parties in properly understanding the ratio decidendi of the above decision led to the present B litigation. 4. Icon Education Society, the appellant herein, maintains and manages two unaided educational institutions at Indore, viz., Indore Institute of Law and Indore Nursing College. Both these institutions qualify as ‘minority educational institutions’ under Section 2(g) of the C National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act, 2004. While so, by letter dated 08.07.2019, the Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (for short, ‘the AFRC’), constituted under Section 4 of the Act of 2007, called upon the Indore Institute of Law to submit its proposal for regulation of the fees pertaining to law courses offered by it. This D was followed up by a reminder on 24.07.2019, which was addressed to all private law colleges in the State of Madhya Pradesh. The appellant society addressed reply dated 31.07.2019, stating that the AFRC was not empowered to regulate the fees charged by minority educational institutions and requesting that the notices issued may be withdrawn or cancelled. The AFRC responded, vide letter dated 14.11.2019, stating E that a decision had been taken in the meeting held on 08.11.2019 that the fees of minority institutions should be fixed by the AFRC. The appellant society was accordingly informed that its request for relaxation from getting the fees fixed by the AFRC was rejected. 5. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant society preferred an appeal F under Section 10 of the Act of 2007 before the designated authority. The appeal was dismissed by the appellate authority, by dated 10.01.2020, holding that the procedure of regulating/fixing of fee was common to both minority and non-minority institutions. The review/recall petition preferred by the appellant society was dismissed with costs by G the appellate authority on 06.03.2020. 6. Thereupon, the appellant society filed WP No. 9690 of 2020 before the Indore Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court.
