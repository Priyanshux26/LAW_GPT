13.50 lakhs and also to hand over the vacant & peaceful possession of the suit land after execution of the sale deed. 18. The High Court while setting aside the and decree passed by the Trial Court, failed to consider Sec. 20(2)(b) of the Specific [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1203 Parswanath Saha v. Bandhana Modak (Das) and Anr. Relief Act, 1963 and wrongly concluded that it will cause hardship to the Defendants because such performance of contract would render the Defendants homeless being conscious of the fact that the defendants were residing in the parental house of Defendant No.1 at Beltali, A.D. Nagar, which she has mentioned and admitted in her examination in chief filed by way of Affidavit. 19. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant prayed that there being merit in his appeal the same may be allowed and the impugned of the High Court may be set aside. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS (ORIGINAL DEFENDANTS) 20. It is not in dispute that Prabha Ranjan Das, the husband of Defendant no. 1 and the father of Defendant no. 2, signed the Bainapatra on 27-05-2016 which was registered on 28-05-2016 for the sale of suit property (residential house), while he was ailing and he died on 05-07-2016 and he had no other property to offer to the defendants to reside. 21. The defendants are the legal heirs of Late Prabha Ranjan Das (Wife and minor Son). An amount of Rs 4,00,000/- was received by cheque by Late Prabha Ranjan Das as advance towards the total sale consideration of Rs 17,50,000/-, 22. In the written statement filed by the defendants, it was specifically pleaded that if the suit premises were to be handed over to the plaintiff pursuant to the subject agreement for sale, the defendants would be rendered shelter-less and therefore, it was prayed that it was a fit case to deny the relief of specific performance. 23. The Trial Court failed to frame the issue regarding the readiness and willingness on the part of plaintiff to perform his part of the contract. 24. In support of the aforesaid submissions, the learned counsel placed reliance on the following decisions: (i) Jayajantham & Ors. v. Abaykumar reported in (2017) 5 SCC 178; (ii) Kamal Kumar v. Prem Lata Joshi and Ors. reported in (2019) 3 SCC 704; 1204 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (iii) Shenbagam and Ors. v. K. K. Rathinavel reported in (1969) 2 SCC 539; (iv) Ouseph Varghese v. Josph Aley reported in (1969) 2 SCC 539. 25. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned counsel prayed that there being no merit in this appeal the same may dismissed. ANALYSIS 26. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record the only question that falls for our consideration is whether the High Court committed any error in passing the impugned . 27. While evaluating whether specific performance ought to have been decreed in the present case, it would be necessary to bear in mind the fundamental principles of law.
