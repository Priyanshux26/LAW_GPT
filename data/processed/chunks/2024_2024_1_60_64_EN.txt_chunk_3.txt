Even if it is assumed that the defendant respondents were in possession from prior to 1944, their possession could not have been adverse even to the Zamindars as they were tenants and their tenancy would be permissible in nature and not adverse. There were no proceedings for possession prior to 1966. 9.6 Further, the first appellate court having recorded a specific finding that the land in suit was not covered by Zamindari Abolition as it was non-agricultural land, the claim of ownership from the date of abolition of Zamindari was also without any merit. The finding has not been disturbed by the High Court. The defendant-respondents thus having failed to establish their title, would have no right to retain the possession. 10. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the impugned and of the High Court is set aside and that of the First Appellate Court decreeing the suit for possession is maintained. 11. There shall be no as to costs. 12. Pending application(s), if any, is/are disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeal allowed.
