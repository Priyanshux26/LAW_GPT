26.5 It was further observed that the Validation Act though a temporary statute did not have an expiry date, in the sense it [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1817 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. was deemed to come into force on 15.02.1992 and validated all imposts up to 04.04.1991 and not thereafter. By this, it didn’t mean that the statute itself expired on 04.04.1991 as it was deemed to come into force on a later date, i.e. on 15.02.1992. The Validation Act was also not a temporary statute. It was observed that the duration of the levy validated under the Act and the life of the Act are two different things which are not necessarily coextensive. The Validation Act would remain in force till Parliament chooses to repeal it. Therefore, the argument that the Validation Act being a temporary statute was not effective from 04.04.1991, was rejected by this Court. It was observed that levies were validated by the Validation Act notwithstanding the cessation of levy after 04.04.1991 and the machinery created to recover and refund the said cesses/taxes was kept alive. 26.6 The of this Court in Kannadasan is a clear indication of the fact that it was the Parliament, by enacting a legislation in the year 1992 in the form of a Validation Act which had to step in to support the States for validation of the States’ incompetent levies, namely, cesses or taxes on royalty which had been set aside over decades by this Court. This legislation was also in the interest of mineral development and in exercise of powers and relatable to Entry 54 - List I. But for the Validation Act enacted by the Parliament, the levies being declared invalid by this Court as well as the High Courts, it was the bounden duty of the States to have refunded the levies collected in the form of cesses or surcharge on cesses on royalties as directed by this Court which would have been a drain on the States’ exchequers. Realising the financial predicament in which the States were, the Parliament, in exercise of its unitary powers and as the Union of the States, came to rescue all the States by passing the Validation Act so that till 04.04.1991, by a fiction the States’ levies in the form of cesses or other taxes on royalty were validated as if the State laws were enacted by Parliament itself. Therefore, all s which had struck down the levies imposed by the State on mineral rights discussed above if had directed to refund the levies collected by them would now not have been necessary. Further, 1818 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports all such State levies being validated, arrears till 04.04.1991 could be collected by the States. Such an Act was passed by way of an abundant caution as in certain other s of this Court, there could be directions to refund the taxes or levies collected and attended complications on the refund of the said incompetent levies or in to collect the arrears till 04.04.1991.
