[2024] 7 S.C.R. 1211 : 2024 INSC 551 Shri Gurudatta Sugars Marketing Pvt. Ltd. v. Prithviraj Sayajirao Deshmukh & Ors. (Criminal Appeal Nos. 3070-3071 of 2024) 24 July 2024 [Vikram Nath* and Prashant Kumar Mishra, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the signatory of the cheque, authorized by the “Company”, is the “drawer” and whether such signatory could be directed to pay interim compensation in terms of section 143-A of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 leaving aside the company. The High Court answered the question in the negative. Headnotes† Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – ss.138, 141, 143-A – Appellant company entered into several agreements with C Ltd. and made advance payments for supply of sugar – C failed to supply – In to discharge the liability, two cheques were issued by respondent nos.1 to 3 (directors of C) in favour of the appellant and the same were dishonoured due to insufficiency of funds – Appellant issued notice – Again payments were not made – Appellant preferred a complaint before the Judicial Magistrate – In the meantime, C was admitted into CIRP – Appellant filed an application u/s. 143-A, NI Act against respondent Nos. 1 to 3 seeking interim compensation – Judicial Magistrate directed each of the respondents to pay 4% of the total cheque amount as interim compensation – The said was challenged by the respondent nos.1 to 3 before the High Court – The High Court allowed the application preferred by the respondent Nos. 1 to 3 herein and set aside the of interim compensation passed by the Judicial Magistrate – Correctness: Held: The High Court’s interpretation of Section 7 of the NI Act accurately identified the “drawer” as the individual who issues the cheque – This interpretation is fundamental to understanding the obligations and liabilities u/s. 138 of the NI Act, which makes it * Author 1212 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
