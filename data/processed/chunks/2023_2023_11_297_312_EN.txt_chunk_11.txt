28. The High Court has relied on the decision of this Court in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal19 to quash the FIR. In that case, this Court held that the High Court can exercise its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution or Section 482 of the CrPC to quash an FIR where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any provisions of a special law with respect to the institution and continuance of the proceedings. As held above, Section 81(5B) does not contain any express or implied bar against any person from setting the criminal law in motion. 29. In the circumstances, we are of the view that the High Court has erred in quashing the FIR which was lodged by the appellant. It is correct that the FIR adverted to the audit which was conducted in respect of the aff airs of the co-operative society. However, once the criminal law is set into motion, it is the duty of the police to investigate into the alleged off ence. This process cannot be interdicted by relying upon the provisions of sub-section (5B) which cast a duty on the auditor to lodge a fi rst information report. 30. We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the impugned and of the High Court dated 16 November 2021 by which the FIR which was lodged by the appellant, namely, FIR No 806 of 2019 dated 19 July 2019 has been quashed. 31. We, however, clarify that the proceedings which have been instituted before the Bombay High Court to challenge the of the Minister shall not be aff ected by the present . 32. The appeal is allowed in the above terms. 19 (1992) Supp (1) SCC 335 312 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 33. The applications for intervention/impleadment are allowed. 34.
