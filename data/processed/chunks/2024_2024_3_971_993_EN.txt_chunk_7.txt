In that context, one of the earliest cases that dealt with the aspect of “public policy” and the general pro-enforcement bias of the New York Convention was the decision in Parsons & Whittemore Overseas Co. v. Societe Generale de L’Industrie du Papier,8 where the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit noted: 4 Ratified on 13.7.1960 5 Travaux Préparatoires, Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York, 1958) Commission on International Trade Law’ (United Nations) 6 J. Burrough, Richardson v. Mellish, (1824) 2 Bing. 229 at 252 7 Enderby Town Football Club Ltd. v. The Football Association Ltd., [1971] Ch 591 8 508 F.2d 969 (1974) 982 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “8. …The general pro-enforcement bias informing the Convention and explaining its supersession of the Geneva Convention points toward a narrow reading of the public policy defense. An expansive construction of this defense would vitiate the Convention’s basic effort to remove preexisting obstacles to enforcement… Additionally, considerations of reciprocity — considerations given express recognition in the Convention itself— counsel courts to invoke the public policy defense with caution lest foreign courts frequently accept it as a defense to enforcement of arbitral awards rendered in the United States. 9. We conclude, therefore, that the Convention’s public policy defense should be construed narrowly. Enforcement of foreign arbitral awards may be denied on this basis only where enforcement would violate the forum state’s most basic notions of morality and justice.” 17. The above decision has been followed in various jurisdictions including the Supreme Court of India in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co9. The articulation of the “forum State’s most basic notions of morality and justice” has been legislatively adopted in the Indian Arbitration Act,1996. The legal framework concerning enforcement of certain foreign awards in International Commercial Arbitration is contained in Part II of the said Act. In this jurisdiction, we must underscore that minimal judicial intervention to a foreign award is the norm and interference can only be based on the exhaustive grounds mentioned under Section 48.10 A review on the merits of the dispute is impermissible11. This Court in Vijay Karia v. Prysmian Cavi E. Sistemi SRL,12 had noted that Section 50 of the Indian Arbitration Act,1996 does not provide an appeal against a foreign award enforced by a of a learned Single Judge of a High Court and therefore the Supreme Court should only entertain the appeal with a view to settle the law. It was noted that the party 9 [1993] Suppl. 3 SCR 22 : 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644 10 Union of India v.

HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Limited (Previously Named Hpeif Holdings 1 Limited) resisting enforcement can only have “one bite at the cherry” and when it loses in the High Court, the limited scope for interference could be merited only in exceptional cases of “blatant disregard of Section 48”.
