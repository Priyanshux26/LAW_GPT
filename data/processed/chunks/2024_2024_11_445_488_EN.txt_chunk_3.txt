The present appeal arises from the dated 30.06.2014 of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (for short the “APTEL”) in Appeal 450 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports No. 29 of 2013. By the said judgement, the APTEL dismissed the appeal of the appellant and confirmed the dated 12.11.2012 of the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (for short the “State Commission”), insofar as issue no. 1 discussed therein was concerned. That issue concerned the aspect of Mega Power Policy and the effect of the Press Release of 01.10.2009. We are only concerned with the said issue in this Appeal. FACTS OF THE CASE: - A) Customs Notification No. 21/2002 dated 01.03.2002. 2. To appreciate the issues involved, certain background facts need to be set out. Goods imported for setting up a Mega Power Project had, under a notification issued under Section 25 of the Customs Act dated 01.03.2002, been granted certain exemptions from customs duty. It will be useful to set out the relevant part of the 01.03.2002 notification. “Exemption and effective rates of basic and additional duty for specified goods of Chapters 1 to 99. - In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 25 of the Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962) and in supersession of the notification of the Government of India in the Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue), No. 17 /2001- Customs, dated the 1st March, 2001 [G.S.R. 116(E), dated the 1st March, 2001], the Central Government, being satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do, hereby exempts the goods of the description specified in column (3) of the Table below or column (3) of the said Table read with the relevant List appended hereto, as the case may be, and falling within the Chapter, heading or sub-heading of the First Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (51 of 1975) as are specified in the corresponding entry in column (2) of the said Table, when imported into India, - (a) from so much of the duty of customs leviable thereon under the said First Schedule as is in excess of the amount calculated at the rate specified in the corresponding entry in column (4) of the said Table; [2024] 11 S.C.R. 451 Nabha Power Limited & Anr.
