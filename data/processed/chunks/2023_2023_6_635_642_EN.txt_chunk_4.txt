Godaverman Thirumulpad Vs. UOI in W.P. (C) No. 202 of 1995 and dated the 21st April, 2014 in the matter of Goa FoundationV s. UOI in W.P(C) No. 435 of 2012. H IN RE : T. N. GODAVARMAN THIRUMULPAD v. UNION OF 641 INDIA & ORS. [B. R. GAVAI, J.] 18. It could thus clearly be seen that Clause A (a) of the Notification of the MoEF also clearly mentions that all the new and existing minor and major minerals, stone quarrying and crushing units shall be prohibited with immediate effect, except for meeting the domestic needs of bona fide local residents, including digging of earth for construction or repair of houses within ESZ. B 19. No doubt that Clause (b) of the Notification of the MoEF mentions that the mining operation shall be carried out in accordance with the of this Court dated 04thAugust 2006 in the matter of T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad Vs. Union of India reported in (2010) 13 SCC 740 and dated 21st April 2014 in the case of Goa C Foundation v. Union of India and Others reported in (2014) 6 SCC 590. 20. However, the last word on the issue is the dated 26th April 2023. The notification is dated 15thOctober 2020, i.e. prior to the pronouncement of our . D 21. As such, the provisions made in clause 1(b) of paragraph 4 of the Notification dated 15thOctober 2020 would now become redundant in view of our and dated 26thApril 2023. 22. As such, any activity, which is prohibited by both the guidelines E as well as the ESZ notification shall strictly be prohibited. Since the mining activity in ESZ area is a prohibited activity, there is no question of such an activity being permitted in an ESZ area even if it falls beyond the distance of one kilometer from the boundary of the protected area. 23. We clarify that even if in a particular case, the ESZ is more F than one kilometer, still, if the concerned area where mining is proposed falls within the ESZ, the mining activity will not be permitted, even if it falls in an area which is beyond one kilometer from the boundary of the Protected Area. 24. The prohibition of one kilometer from the boundary of G Protected Area is only with regard to the cases where the boundary of ESZ is less than one kilometer from the boundary of the sanctuary. Only in such cases, the ban on mining will travel beyond the ESZ area and cover an area upto a distance of one kilometer. H 642 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 25. The aforesaid directions were issued in to protect the National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries so that the mines would not become a death trap for the flora and fauna within them. 26. Apart from that, the dated 26thApril 2023 is delivered by a Bench of three Judges of this Court, which is binding on us. B 27. As such the application is rejected.
