However, in cases like this, where it is glaring from the plaint averments that the suit is hopelessly barred by limitation, the Courts should not be hesitant in granting the relief and drive the parties back to the trial Court. We again place it on record that this is not a case where any forgery or fabrication is committed which had recently come to the knowledge of the plaintiff. Rather, the plaintiff and his predecessors did not take any steps to assert their title and rights in time. The alleged cause of action is also found to be creation of fiction. However, the trial Court erroneously dismissed the application filed by the appellants under VII Rule 11(d) of CPC. The High Court also erred in affirming the same, keeping the question of limitation open to be considered by the trial Court after considering the evidence along with other issues, without deciding the core issue on the basis of the averments 28 (2020) 6 SCC 629 : (2020) 3 SCC (Civ) 732 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1481 Shri Mukund Bhavan Trust and Ors. v. Shrimant Chhatrapati Udayan Raje Pratapsinh Maharaj Bhonsle and Another made by the Respondent No.1 in the Plaint as mandated by VII Rule 11 (d) of CPC. The spirit and intention of VII Rule 11(d) of CPC is only for the Courts to nip at its bud when any litigation ex facie appears to be a clear abuse of process. The Courts by being reluctant only cause more harm to the defendants by forcing them to undergo the ordeal of leading evidence. Therefore, we hold that the plaint is liable to be rejected at the threshold. 27. In fine, this appeal stands allowed by setting aside the s so passed by the Courts below and the application filed by the appellants under VII Rule 11(d) of CPC is allowed by rejecting the plaint in Special Civil Suit No.133 of 2009 filed by the Respondent No.1. However, there is no as to costs. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the Case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
