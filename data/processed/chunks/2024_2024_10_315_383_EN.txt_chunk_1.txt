Union of India & Ors. Held: Timelines mentioned in rr.3 and 4 are couched in mandatory language and, thus, have to be strictly followed – This is keeping in view that UAPA being a penal legislation, strict construction must be accorded to it – Timelines imposed by way of statutory Rules are a way to keep a check on executive power which is a necessary position to protect the rights of accused persons – Independent review by both the authority recommending sanction and the authority granting sanction, are necessary aspects of compliance with s.45 of the UAPA – As regards appellant’s case that the timelines were not followed, the first sanction was granted more than a year after the recommendation was moved; and that there was no independent review on the part of both recommending authority and central government, as the sanction was merely granted within a day each, the gap between the first action against A-6 and the arrest of the appellant is a result of continuing investigation, as the appellant was made an accused in the second supplementary chargesheet, arising out of the same FIR; and since the investigation continued, the gap cannot be termed fatal so as to render the arrest of the appellant as unlawful or illegal – Grant of sanction is within the stipulated time – Furthermore, it cannot be said that there was non application of mind and lack of independent review.
