There are no details made available about the consideration made as to, over the years how many OCI cardholders have succeeded in getting a seat after competing in the selection process by which there was denial of seats to Indian Citizens though they were similar merit- wise. Per contra, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners has placed C reliance on the statement made by the Hon’ble Minister in reply to the question raised in the Rajya Sabha as recent as on 13.12.2022, and an extract to indicate the details is produced along with I.A. No.4763 of 2023 for additional documents in W.P. (C) No.246 of 2022. The details shown are as follows:- D “STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO RAJYA SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.64* FOR 13TH DECEMBER, 2022 (a) to (c) As per information received from National Testing Agency (NTA), the details of number of students who appeared E for the NEET-UG examination in the last three years are as under:- Year 2022 2021 2020 Number of 18,72,343 16,14,777 15,97,435 students registered F Number of 17,64,571 15,44,273 13,66,945 students appeared The details of number of Undergraduate (UG)/Postgraduate (PG) seats available during the admission process of last three years G are as under:- H ANUSHKA RENGUNTHWAR & ORS. v.

Hence, it is sought to be pointed out on behalf of the petitioners that the explanation put forth does not indicate the true State of Affairs in as much as, seats have still remained vacant in the previous years. It is no doubt true that as contended by the learned Additional Solicitor General, the vacancies will remain due to several factors such as reservation of seats, other permutations and combinations as also the E preferred and non-preferred colleges. Be that as it may, the dire need to take away the bestowed right by applying the impugned notification even to young students who technically though are not citizens of this country but were provided certain rights in such manner would not be justified as it does not demonstrate nexus to the object sought to be achieved. Policy F decision for the future, certainly is within the domain of Respondent No.1 based on the sovereign powers of the State. Even on that aspect all that has been stated is that the decision to issue the notification was taken in the meeting of Secretaries held on 19.07.2018 without indicating the nature of deliberations. Therefore, in that perspective, keeping in view the present position, the decision to supersede the earlier notifications G and take away the right of OCI Cardholders in whose favour such right had accrued and they have acted in a manner to take benefit of such right should not have been nullified without reference to the consequences.
