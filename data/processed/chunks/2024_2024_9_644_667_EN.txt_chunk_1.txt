XII r.6, when: Held: It is not that a court cannot pass a on the basis of an admission made in some other case – All the same, it has to be kept in mind that Ord.

XII r.6 only in cases where admissions are unconditional, unequivocal and unambiguous or when admission is based upon undisputed 646 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports inferences – It is for the courts to see whether any statement in the pleadings or otherwise amounts to an admission of such a nature as to inspire the confidence of the court to pass on admission u/Ord. XII r.6 – It will depend upon the content and kind of statement/admission which may vary from case to case – It would depend upon the totality of facts and circumstances of a particular given case – Ord. XII r.6 is meant for speedy disposal of the suits in some cases and unless there is a clear, unambiguous, unequivocal and unconditional admission, courts should not exercise their discretion under the Rule because on admissions is without a trial which may even preclude a party to challenge the matter on merits in the court of appeal – Provision of law, which is meant for the expeditious disposal of appropriate cases, should therefore be cautiously exercised and it should never come in the way of any defendant denying him the valuable right of contesting the claim.
