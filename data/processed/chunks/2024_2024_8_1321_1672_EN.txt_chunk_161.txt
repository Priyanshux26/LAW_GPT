1548 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports IV. PRESENT REFERENCE 169. A 3-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of State of Punjab and others vs. Davinder Singh and others16 vide dated 20th August 2014, doubted the correctness of the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in the case of E.V. Chinnaiah and referred it to the larger Bench. The larger Bench of 5-Learned Judges proposed the following issues.17 “1.1. (i) Whether the provisions contained under Section 4(5) of the Punjab Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act, 2006 are constitutionally valid? 1.2. (ii) Whether the State had the legislative competence to enact the provisions contained under Section 4(5) of the Act? 1.3. (iii) Whether the decision in E.V. Chinnaiah v. State of A.P. [E.V. Chinnaiah v. State of A.P., (2005) 1 SCC 394 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 329] is required to be revisited?” 170. Vide the in The State of Punjab & Ors. vs. Davinder Singh & Ors.,18 the Constitution Bench observed thus: “52. The State has the competence to grant reservation benefit to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in terms of Articles 15(4) and 16(4) and also Articles 341(1) and 342(1). It prescribes the extent/percentage of reservation to different classes. The State Government can decide the manner and quantum of reservation. As such, the State can also make sub-classification when providing reservation to all Scheduled Castes in the List based on the rationale that would conform with the very spirit of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution providing reservation. The State Government cannot tamper with the List; it can neither include nor exclude any caste in the List or make enquiry whether any synonym exists as held 16 (2020) 8 SCC 65 17 (2020) 8 SCC 63 18 (2020) 8 SCC 1 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1549 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. in Milind [State of Maharashtra v. Milind (2001) 1 SCC 4 : 2001 SCC (L&S) 117] . 53. The State Government is conferred with the power to provide reservation and to distribute it equitably. The State Government is the best judge as to the disparities in different areas. In our opinion, it is for the State Government to judge the equitable manner in which reservation has to be distributed. It can work out its methodology and give the preferential treatment to a particular class more backward out of Scheduled Castes without depriving others of benefit. 54. Apart from that, the other class out of Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes/socially and educationally backward classes, who is not denied the benefit of reservation, cannot claim that whole or a particular percentage of reservation should have been made available to them. The State can provide such preference on rational criteria to the class within Lists requiring upliftment. There is no vested right to claim that reservation should be at a particular percentage. It has to accord with ground reality as no one can claim the right to enjoy the whole reservation, it can be proportionate one as per requirement.
