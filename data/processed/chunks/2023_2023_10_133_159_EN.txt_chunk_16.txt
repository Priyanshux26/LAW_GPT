Committee will take a decision and allocate the final quantity.” The same documents i.e., the minutes also recorded that Sanvira’s additional capacity was created after this court’s dated 09.10.2018. H 156 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 25. From all these facts, it is evident that Sanvira kept on contending that its capacity was 3,30,000 MTPA. The minutes of the meeting dated 13.02.2020, also allude to the previous attempts by Sanvira, to have its capacity increased, as on 09.10.2018 in an effort to secure more allocation. All such contentions were rejected. In this background, the view expressed by the single judge, that the principle for allocation was B changed somewhat in the public notice, dated 17.04.2020, is not tenable. The relevant part of that notice reads as follows: “All eligible entities desiring to avail quota as mentioned above may apply for import license as per procedure mentioned in Trade Notice No. 49 dated 15th March 2019 C along with State Pollution Control Board Certificate (SPCB)/ Pollution Control Committee (PCC) indicating capacity of the unit as on 9.10.2018 (Hon’ble Supreme Court in Writ Petition No. 13029/1985) and also· valid consent certificate from SPCB/ PCC, In the name of user industrial units D indicating the quantity permitted for import and its usage on a monthly and yearly basis.” Interestingly, even as on that day, i.e. 17.04.2020, there was no confirmation by the APPCB that Sanvira’s unit had the capacity it claimed (3,30,000 MT annually). The CTO for that capacity had been issued E only on 26.12.2019. As on that day, there was nothing to show that the earlier CTO stood amended with effect from the date it was issued (i.e. 24.02.2017), or any date prior to 09.10.2018. In such background, Sanvira wrote to APPCB, on 21.04.2020 seeking a “clarification”: “To F The Environmental Engineer Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Soard Regional Office, Visakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh Dear Sir, G 21·04·2020 Sub: Request to certify installed capacity of Sanvira Industries limited as on 09.10.2018 as 330, 000 MTPA of Calcined Petroleum Coke Sanvira Industries Limited had completed line-2 expansion (130,000 MTPA) of its Calcined Petroleum H M/S.
