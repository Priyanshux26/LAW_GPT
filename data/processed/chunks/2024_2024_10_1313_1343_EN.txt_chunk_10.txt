The reliable evidence can be relied upon especially when the substratum of the prosecution case remains intact. The court must be diligent in separating truth from falsehood. Only in exceptional circumstances, when truth and falsehood are so 16 (1969) 3 SCC 890 17 Ponnam Chandraiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh (2008) 11 SCC 640 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1329 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others inextricably connected as to make it indistinguishable, should the entire body of evidence be discarded. Testimony of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) 17. The deposition of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) equally supports the prosecution case. His testimony captures the following: (i) On 13.06.1998, he reached IGIMS hospital at about 7:00 p.m. to meet Brij Bihari Prasad. (ii) He confirmed the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1). Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Ram Nandan Singh (PW-12), Onkar Singh and some other people at the hospital. (iii) After a passing remark by Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) that it was hot in the hospital room, Brij Bihari Prasad stepped outside for a stroll. Brij Bihari Prasad was accompanied by Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Lakshmeshwar Sahu and other security personnel. (iv) In the meanwhile, a Sumo car and an Ambassador car came inside the hospital campus. About 10-12 persons alighted from the said vehicles and moved toward Brij Bihari Prasad. (v) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) was carrying a carbine and others were carrying pistols. (vi) He specifically identified Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased), Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since deceased), Rajan Tiwari (A-9), Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) and Satish Pandey as the persons who alighted from the aforementioned vehicles. (vii) Mantu Tiwari (A-4), Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) and Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since deceased) fired at Brij Bihari Prasad. Others were also firing indiscriminately in different directions. (viii) Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Satish Pandey and Rajan Tiwari (A-9) shot at Lakshmeshwar Sahu. (ix) On being shot, Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu collapsed. 1330 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (x) Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) took the carbine belonging to Lakshmeshwar Sahu and thereafter exclaimed that the work had been done.

(xii) The occurrence took place at about 8:30 p.m. (xiii) The police and CBI had interrogated him in this regard. 18. We have carefully scrutinized the cross-examination of Mahanth Ashwini Das (PW-25). His cross-examination states: (i) Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) was introduced to Brij Bihari Prasad in 1996. This was around the same time Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) became a disciple under Sanatan Dharma. (ii) He had also known Rama Devi (PW-24), wife of Brij Bihari Prasad, since 1996. (iii) Rama Devi (PW-24) was present in the court while his testimony was being recorded. However, Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) denies speaking to her. (iv) Mahanth Ashwini Das (PW-25) states that while there was no particular reason to meet Brij Bihari Prasad on 13.06.1998, he would generally meet Brij Bihari Prasad whilst in Patna.
