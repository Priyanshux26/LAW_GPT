1-Sanjit Saha for restoration of the Special Leave Petitions along with an application for condonation of delay and for recalling of the court’s dated 24.02.2020. I.A. No.113070/2023 was for condonation of delay in fi ling and I.A. No.95673/2023 was for recalling of the Court’s . 6. On being satisfi ed that the petitioner No.1 had surrendered on 15.03.2019 itself, the Special Leave Petition was restored insofar as Petitioner No.1 was concerned. It was noticed that since petitioner no.1 and petitioner no.2 had fi led a common Special Leave Petitions and only petitioner no.1 had taken steps for recall by pointing out that he has in fact surrendered on 15.03.2019, an was passed to conduct an enquiry about the status of the surrender of petitioner no.2. 7. For the sake of convenience, the dated 25.09.2023, passed in the applications of Sanjit Saha, Petitioner No. 1, are set out herein-below: “Delay condoned. The application for exemption from surrendering fi led by the applicant came up for hearing on 01.03.2019 before the Judge In- Chambers. The applicant was given six weeks’ time to surrender and fi le proof thereof. Thereafter, the matter came up for hearing on 24.02.2020 before the Learned Judge In-Chambers and on the ground that surrender proof had not been fi led an was passed to the following eff ect:- “Perused Offi ce Report dated 21.01.2020. By dated 01.03.2019, Hon’ble Judge, In-Chamber, has rejected the application of the petitioners for exemption from surrendering. By the very same six weeks’ time has been granted to the petitioners to surrender and produce the proof thereof. In spite of time granted, learned counsel for the petitioner has not fi led proof of surrender of the petitioners so far. SANJIT SAHA & ANR. v. THE STATE OF WEST BENGAL 87 Two weeks’ further time is granted to learned counsel for the petitioners to fi le proof of surrender of the petitioners failing which the special leave petition(s) shall stand dismissed without any further reference to the Court.” No surrender proof having been fi led on or before 09.03.2020, the SLP stood peremptorily dismissed. Now the applicant has fi led an application on 05.05.2023 setting out that after the of this Court dated 01.03.2019, the applicant surrendered on 15.03.2019 and surrender proof was sent to the then Advocate-on-Record. However, it appears that the said proof of surrender was not fi led in Court and also there was no appearance on 24.02.2020 when the matter came up for hearing. This had resulted in the dated 24.02.2020. It further appears that the Advocate-on-record who was originally engaged had passed away on 10.04.2021. It is averred that the son of the applicant, after making enquiries, has now taken steps to engage a new Advocate-on-Record and through the new Advocate-on-Record the present application for recall of the dated 24.02.2020 and to restore SLP(Crl) D.No.46699 of 2018 has been fi led. The application is supported by a copy of the detention certifi cate issued by the Superintendent of Balurghat Central Correctional Home, which indicates that on 15.03.2019 the applicant was in custody.
