Facts in SLP (Civil) No. 20267 of 2024: 13. The respondent no. 4-Ms. Tasmiya Khan herein filed a Writ Petition in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore seeking a mandamus to the official respondents therein to allot a seat to her as per the overall marks in NEET for the MBBS for the academic year 2023- 24. Her prayer was to consider her against the unreserved category in the 5% Government School quota. According to R-4, candidates with lesser NEET score have been admitted under the Unreserved Government School Quota while she, though an OBC candidate had secured more marks than those general candidates. An interim was passed on 22.09.2023 modifying the earlier interim stating that one seat be kept vacant till the next date of hearing (if not already filled). Based on the interim of 22.09.2023, the Director of Medical Education on 26.09.2023 issued a direction to the appellant-college to keep on hold one seat in the MBBS course and directed that the said seat will not be included for the College Level Counselling Round. 14. The official respondents opposed the Writ Petition. The State contended that the category of the writ petitioner was OBC- Government School quota (OBC-GS), and in this category there were eight OBC GS candidates above the petitioner. In simple terms, the State did not follow the principle that reserved candidates who qualified on merit ought to be first adjusted against the general seats. On 25.10.2023, the appellant intervened praying that keeping seats vacant will prejudice the college in case the cut-off date expires before the disposal of the Writ Petition. 15. By the of 22.12.2023, the High Court rejected the petition of R-4 accepting the plea of the authorities and held that the appellant would be entitled only for consideration against the OBC GS quota. Coming to the intervention application of the appellant-college it was held that no relief can be granted since timeline for admission was complete. Aggrieved, the college has filed the present appeal by way of Special Leave. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 707 Ramkrishna Medical College Hospital & Research Centre v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. 16. It should be pointed out that insofar as this matter is concerned, R-4 herein Ms. Tasmiya Khan filed SLP(C) No. 2311 of 2024 and by the of 20.08.2024, the of the High Court dated 22.12.2023 in Writ Petition No. 23998 of 2023 was set aside and a direction was given to admit R-4 in MBBS course for the academic year 2024-25. This Court, speaking through one of us (B.R. Gavai, J.) held that the candidates who were meritorious and who could have been admitted against the Unreserved-Government Schools category could not have been denied admission on the ground that they belonged to OBC category. This Court held that meritorious candidates belonging to SC, ST and OBC who on their own merit are entitled to be selected against the Unreserved Government School Quota (UR GS) could not have been denied the seats in the open category.
