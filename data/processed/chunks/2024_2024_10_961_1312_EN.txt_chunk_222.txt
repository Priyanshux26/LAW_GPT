State of Assam, 2014 SCC OnLine Gau 103. The High Court held that Section 5(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act permitted the registration of the undocumented migrants of Indian Origin until the amendment in 2003. 69 “2003 Amendment Act” 70 “illegal migrant means a foreigner who has entered into India- (i) without a valid passport or other travel documents and such other document or authority as may be prescribed by or under any law in that behalf; or (ii) with a valid passport or other travel documents and such other document or authority as may be prescribed by or under any law in that behalf but remains therein beyond the permitted period of time.” 1270 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports travel documents prescribed by law; or (b) with a valid passport and travel documents but has overstayed. The 2003 Amendment Act also amended Sections 5 and 6 of the Act to exclude illegal immigrants from acquiring citizenship by naturalisation and registration. Sections 5 and 6 of the Citizenship Act, after the amendments introduced by the 2003 Amendment Act now expressly bar illegal migrants from acquiring citizenship by registration or naturalisation.71 In addition to the amendments excluding illegal immigrants, the enactment also deleted Section 5(1)(e) which permitted the registration by citizens of countries specified in the First Schedule. 50. It is clear from the above discussion that undocumented migrants could be registered as Indian citizens under the Citizenship Act until the enactment of the 2003 Amendment Act which came into force on 3 December 2004 by which the class of ‘illegal immigrants’ was excluded from acquiring citizenship. b. The legal regime governing migrants from East and West Pakistan to Assam 51. The legal regime on citizenship must be read alongside other laws that deal with migrants. On 23 November 1946, the Foreigners Act 194672 was enacted to confer upon the Central Government certain powers in respect of foreigners. A ‘foreigner’ was defined as a person who is not a natural born British subject as defined in Sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 1 of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act of 1914 or who was not granted a certificate of naturalization as a British subject under Indian law.73 Section 3 conferred the Central Government the power to make provisions for prohibiting, regulating or restricting the entry of foreigners to India.74 In exercise of the power under Section 3, the Central 71 Citizenship Act 1955; Section 5: “Subject to the provisions of this section and such other conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed, the Central Government may, on an application made in this behalf, register as a citizen of India any person not being an illegal migrant […]”; Section 6” Where an application is made in the prescribed manner by any person of full age and capacity not being an illegal migrant […]” 72 “Foreigners Act” 73 The Foreigners Act 1946, Section 2(a) 74 Section 3(2): In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, s made under this section may provide that the foreigner— (a) shall not enter [India] or shall enter [India] only at such times and by such route and at such port or place and subject to the observance of such conditions on arrival as may be prescribed; (b) shall not depart from [India], or shall depart only at such times and by such route and from such port [2024] 10 S.C.R.
