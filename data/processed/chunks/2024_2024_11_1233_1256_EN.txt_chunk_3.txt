During investigation, inter alia, statements of witnesses who had seen the deceased in the company of the accused on 2.2.1997 during daytime and who had seen the two accused in the company 1238 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of each other, late in the night of 2.2.1997, on the pathway, near the place from where the dead body of the deceased was recovered were recorded. Based on that, a charge sheet was submitted against the appellants. 6. After taking cognizance on the charge sheet, the case was committed to the Court of Session. The Sessions Court framed charges against the appellants for offences punishable under Sections 302 /201 read with Section 34 IPC. The accused appellants denied the charges and claimed for trial. PROSECUTION EVIDENCE 7. As the prosecution case rests on circumstantial evidence, to test the correctness of the findings, a scrutiny of the evidence would be apposite. We would, therefore, notice the prosecution evidence in some detail. 8. Prosecution had examined 10 witnesses: (a) PW-1 (the autopsy surgeon) proved the autopsy report. He accepted the possibility of: (a) head injuries being caused by a sharp-edged stone or a sharp-edged weapon; (b) death having occurred a day before i.e., on 2.2.1997 around 5.30 PM. (b) PW-2 – Hayat Singh – He had his shop about 30 yards away from Mohan Singh’s shop (i.e., from where the dead body was recovered on 3.2.1997). According to him, on 2.2.1997, at about 7 PM, while he was sitting at his shop, next to a fire-place to ward off cold winter night, he saw three persons coming from near Mohan Singh’s shop. Those three were Jagdish Punetha and the two accused. Later, that night, between 10 PM and 11 PM, while he was returning to his shop to fetch his purse, in torch light, he saw the two accused going together on the same path towards village Bhumlai. During cross-examination, PW-2 stated (a) that his statement was recorded by the investigating officer on 9.2.1997; (b) prior to that, he made no disclosure about it to any one; (c) that night, it was drizzling; (d) that from his shop, Mohan Singh’s shop is 30-35 yards away and in between his shop and Mohan Singh’s shop there are shrubs, therefore, it is difficult to notice [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1239 Suresh Chandra Tiwari & Anr. v. State of Uttarakhand as to who is doing what there, from his shop; (e) that in 1995 he had a fight with accused Bhuwan (appellant no.2), which was compromised on payment of Rs.3000 by him. (c) PW-3 – Mohan Singh (i.e., the shop-owner from whose shop’s verandah, dead body was recovered) stated that on 2.2.1997, at about 6 PM, the two accused had come to his shop at Tolan and had asked for milk. After having milk, they asked each other about the deceased. He heard them saying that the deceased has not been seen. Shortly thereafter, they left his shop with Jagdish Punetha, who was present at the shop from before.
