Digital Supreme Court Reports 62. The opinion of Justice D A Desai referred to the s of this Court in Baijnath Kedia v. State of Bihar110 and State of Haryana v. Chanan Mal111 “on an identical Entry 54, List I.”112 It was also argued that Section 2 of IDRA,113 unlike Section 2 of MMDRA114 does not provide that the Union shall take control “to the extent herewith provided”, and thus, IDRA takes full control over the scheduled industries. Rejecting the argument, Justice D A Desai noted that the “words of limitation on the power to make declaration are ‘by law’”.115 Justice R S Pathak, as the learned Chief Justice then was, (writing for himself and Justice Koshal) observed that he would refrain from expressing any opinion on this issue and that the challenge to the validity of the impugned enactment could be disposed of without a reference to Entries 52 of List I and 24 of List II.116 63. In ITC (supra), another Constitution Bench briefly dealt with this issue. It was argued that this Court in Ishwari Khetan (supra) equated Entry 52 of List I with Entry 54 of List II. Justice Y K Sabharwal, as the learned Chief Justice then was, writing for the majority specifically rejected the argument that Entry 54 was equated with Entry 52 and observed that the “decision does not adopt the mines and minerals cases for the purposes of considering the scope of Entry 52 of List I.”117 64. We agree with the opinion of Justice Desai in Ishwari Khetan (supra). Entries 52 and 54 of List I (and entries 23 and 24 of List II) are unique. Though entries 23 and 24 stipulate that they are subject 110 [1970] 2 SCR 100 111 [1976] 3 SCR 688 112 (1980) 4 SCC 136 [8] 113 “2. Declaration as to expediency of control by Union: It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the industries specified in the First Schedule.” 114 “2. Declaration as to expediency of Union Control.- It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided.” [emphasis supplied] 115 (1980) 4 SCC 136 [11] 116 “44. […] It seems to us that the observations made by this Court in Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. Ltd. v. State of Orissa [AIR 1961 SC 459 : (1961) 2 SCR 537] , State of Orissa v. M.A. Tulloch and Co. [AIR 1964 SC 1284 : (1964) 4 SCR 461] , Baijnath Kadio v. State of Bihar [(1969) 3 SCC 838, 847-848 : AIR 1970 SC 1436 : (1970) 2 SCR 100, 113] and State of Haryana v. Chanan Mal [(1977) 1 SCC 340, 351 : AIR 1976 SC 1654 : (1976) 3 SCR 688, 700] cannot be of assistance in this behalf. In each of those cases, the declaration made by Parliament in the concerned enactment limited the control of the mines and the development of minerals to the extent provided in the enactment.
