(See High Court of Judicature at Bombay through its Registrar vs. Udaysingh and others 9). 35. Neither the Acting President of the NCLT nor the NCLAT examined, with any seriousness, the issues raised before them to come to a cogent conclusion as to whether the disputes raised by the respondents were mere moonshine. Notably, in Ammonia Supplies Corporation (P) Ltd. (supra), this Court held to that effect in the context of Section 155 of the Companies Act, 1956. Thereafter, in Aadesh Kaur (supra) also, this Court affirmed that if, on facts, an open-and-shut case of fraud is made out in favour of the person seeking rectification, the National Company Law Tribunal would be entitled to exercise such power under Section 59 of the Act of 2013. Therefore, verification of this aspect was essential but the NCLT failed to discharge this mandate. 36. Another crucial fact that needs to be noted is that the interim passed on 27.06.2019 by the Member (Judicial) of the NCLT had indicated, in clear terms, the issues that arose for consideration and the inquiry required to determine the same. However, ignoring the said interim , the Acting President of the NCLT chose to summarily dismiss the petition, without considering the material already placed on record and without further evidence being adduced. The documents that were referred to and attached to the Company Petition and the appellants’ rejoinder were glossed over 9 [1997] 3 SCR 803 : (1997) 5 SCC 129 256 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports or were completely ignored. Compounding the error of the Acting President of the NCLT, the NCLAT did not even get the facts right. Production of the original share certificates by the appellants and their argument, relying on Section 46 of the Act of 2013, that the signatures thereon by two Directors was sufficient in the eye of law, was totally lost sight of by the NCLAT. Further, the NCLAT blindly accepted the story put forth by respondent No. 2 to such an extent that it totally overlooked the fact that it was the appellants who had paid ₹14,66,39,400/- to respondent No. 2. Neither the NCLT nor the NCLAT chose to labour over the actual issues for consideration by looking at the documentary evidence already placed on record or by calling for further evidence in that regard. 37. On the above analysis, these appeals deserve to be and are, accordingly, allowed. The in Company Petition No. 667/59 & 241/HDB/2018 and the in Company Appeal (AT) (CH) No. 44 of 2021 & I.A. No. 548 of 2021 are set aside. Company Petition No. 667/59 & 241/HDB/2018 is restored to the file of the National Company Law Tribunal, Amaravati Bench, for consideration afresh on merits and in accordance with law, upon proper appreciation of evidence. Given the passage of time since the institution of the petition, we would request the National Company Law Tribunal, Amaravati Bench, to give priority to the same and endeavour to dispose it of as expeditiously as possible.
