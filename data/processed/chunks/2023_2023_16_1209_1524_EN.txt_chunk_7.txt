[Paras 123, 124, 125, 127, 128, 130, 133, 149, 166] – Held (per Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, CJI) (Dissenting): Unmarried couples (including queer couples) can jointly adopt a child – Regulation 5(3), though facially neutral, indirectly discriminates against atypical unions (such as the relationship between non-heterosexual partners) which have not been recognised by the State – Regulation 5(3) is ultra vires the JJ Act, Articles 14, and 15 – Regulation 5(3) is read down to exclude the word “marital” – The reference to a ‘couple’ in Regulation 5 includes both married and unmarried couples as well as queer couples – The principle in Regulation 5(2)(a) that the consent of spouses in a marriage must be obtained if they wish to adopt a child together is equally applicable to unmarried couples who seek to jointly adopt a child – However, while framing regulations, the State may impose conditions which will subserve the best interest and welfare of the child. [Para 340]. Special Marriage Act, 1954 (SMA) – Challenge to SMA and allied laws, on the ground of under classifi cation – Not tenable – Prayer for reading of their provisions in a ‘gender neutral’ manner so as to enable same-sex marriage – Not sustainable – Judicial Review –Scope: Held (per Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, CJI): The SMA was enacted to enable persons of diff erent religions and castes to marry – If the SMA is held void for excluding same-sex couples, it would take India back to the pre-independence era where two persons of diff erent religions and caste were unable to celebrate love in the form of marriage – Such a 121 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. judicial verdict would not only have the eff ect of taking the nation back to the era when it was clothed in social inequality and religious intolerance but would also push the courts to choose between eradicating one form of discrimination and prejudice at the cost of permitting another – If this Court reads words into the provisions of the SMA and provisions of other allied laws, it would in eff ect be entering into the realm of the legislature – This Court cannot either strike down the constitutional validity of SMA or read words into the SMA because of its institutional limitations – This Court cannot read words into the provisions of the SMA and provisions of other allied laws because that would amount to judicial legislation – The Court in the exercise of the power of judicial review must steer clear of matters, particularly those impinging on policy, which fall in the legislative domain – Whether a change should be brought into the legislative regime of the SMA is for Parliament to determine. [Paras 204, 207, 208 and 340] – Held [per S. Ravindra Bhat, J. (for himself and Hima Kohli, J.)] (Concurring) : The challenge to the SMA on the ground of under classifi cation is not made out – Further, the petitioner’s prayer to read various provisions in a ‘gender neutral’ manner so as to enable same-sex marriage, is unsustainable – Exclusion or under inclusion, per se, cannot be characterised as discriminatory, unless the excluded category of persons, things or matters, which are the subject matter of the law (or policy) belong to the same class (the included class) – If one looks at the enacted provisions, especially Sections 19-21 and 21A, Sections 24, 25, 27, 31, 37 and 38, of SMA, there can be no doubt that the sole intention was to enable marriage (as it was understood then, i.e., for heterosexual couples) of persons professing or belonging to diff erent faiths, an option hitherto available, subject to various limitations – There was no idea to exclude non-heterosexual couples, because at that time, even consensual physical intimacy of such persons, was outlawed by Section 377 IPC – So, while the Act sought to provide an avenue for those marriages that did not enjoy support in society, or did not have the benefi t of custom to solemnise, it would be quite a stretch to say that this included same sex marriages – Therefore, the challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, must fail – As long as an objective is clearly discernible, it cannot be attacked merely because it does not make a better classifi cation – The original rationale for SMA was to facilitate inter-faith marriages – That reason is as valid today as it was at the time of birthing that law – It cannot be condemned on the ground of irrelevance, due to passage of time – The provisions of SMA are incapable of being “reading down”, or interpreted by “reading up” in the manner suggested by the petitioners – The general SUPRIYO @ SUPRIYA CHAKRABORTY & ANR.
