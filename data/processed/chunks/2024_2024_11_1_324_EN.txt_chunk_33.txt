By an dated 17 July 2014, a three-judge Bench of this Court has referred several questions arising from these appeals to a Bench of five judges.31 On 26 February 2016, 28 Writ Petition No 660 of 1998. 29 [1997] Supp. 6 SCR 717 : (1998) 2 SCC 1 : 1997 INSC 831 30 Civil Appeal No. 16879 of 1996. 31 Questions referred: “a. Whether Article 300 A, which does not contain a provision like Article 31(2), would mandate payment of any amount as compensation for depriving of a person of his property under the authority of law? If yes, then what are the parameters of adjudging the principles for payment of amount or the amount fixed by the Acquiring Act as illusory? b. Whether the Constitutional Amendments inserting the amending Acts in the 9th Schedule would be violative of the Basic Structure of the Constitution and would therefore be open to challenge in the light of the of this Hon’ble Court in I.R. Coelho (Dead by LRS) Vs. State of Tamil Nadu [(2007) 2 SCC 1] and therefore be liable to be struck down? c. Whether the Section 4-D inserted by the 1981 Amendment Act of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 which prescribes the offences and penalties with retrospective effect from 07.08.1969 in the face of the prohibition contained in Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India is valid?” 46 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the five-Judge Bench of this Court so constituted directed that these appeals be listed after the disposal of the underlying civil appeals in the present case. It is clarified that the intervenors have only been heard on the issues that arise from the reference before us. This judgement does not deal with the West Bengal Land Reforms Act 1955 or any other related enactment. A determination on the questions of law referred to the five-judge bench and adjudication of the constitutionality of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act 1955 will be carried out by appropriate benches of this Court. C. Article 31C i. Brief History of Article 31-C 35. Article 31-C provides statutes with immunity against constitutional challenges for alleged breaches of Articles 14 and 19 provided that the statutes give effect to the principles set out in clauses (b) or (c) of Article 39. Article 31-C represents a constitutionally sanctioned limitation on the operation of certain Part III rights insofar as they give effect to the Directive Principles contained in clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39. 36. When inserted into the Constitution in 1971, Article 31-C provided that no law giving effect to a State policy securing the principles set out in clauses (b) or (c) of Article 39 was void on the ground that it impermissibly abridged the rights conferred by Articles 14, 19, or 31. However, Article 31-C has been amended by Parliament and interpreted by this Court on several occasions. It is therefore necessary to clearly lay out the history of this constitutional provision before adverting to the current controversy concerning the provision.
