There has been considerable emphasis on part of the Appellants with regard to the use of the term “found” in the aforesaid paragraphs which shall be discussed in the subsequent part of the . 133. Thereafter, the judgement in S.P. Mittal v. Union of India, (1983) 1 SCC 51 rendered by a bench of five Hon’ble Judges, albeit without much discussion on this specific issue, holds that the establishment of an institution by a linguistic or religious minority is necessary for claiming benefit under Article 30(1). The relevant paragraphs are quoted as under : “137. The impugned Act does not seek to curtail the rights of any section of citizens to conserve its own language, script or culture conferred by Article 29. In to claim the benefit of Article 30(1) the community must show : (a) that it is a religious or linguistic minority, (b) that the institution was established by it. Without satisfying these two conditions it cannot claim the guaranteed rights to administer it. 138. In Re Kerala Education Bill, 1957 [AIR 1958 SC 956 : 1959 SCR 995 : 1959 SCJ 321] Article 30(1) of the Constitution which deals with the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions, came for consideration. The Kerala Education Bill, 1957, which had been passed by the Kerala Legislative Assembly was reserved by the Governor for consideration by the President. xxx 142. On an analysis of the two Articles, Article 29 and Article 30 and the three cases referred to above, it is evident that the impugned Act does not seek to curtail the right of any section of citizens to conserve its own language, script or culture conferred by Article 29. The benefit of [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1967 Aligarh Muslim University v. Naresh Agarwal & Ors. Article 30(1) can be claimed by the community only on proving that it is a religious or linguistic minority and that the institution was established by it. In the view that we have taken that Auroville or the Society is not a religious denomination, Articles 29 and 30 would not be attracted and, therefore, the impugned Act cannot be held to be violative of Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution.” 134. More recently, in the judgement in Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) College Trust and Management Society v. State of Maharashtra, (2013) 4 SCC 14, a Society claimed to have minority status in the State of Maharashtra as it sought to encourage Hindi, which is a linguistic minority in the said State. While examining the question of law, the Court held that the establishment of an institution as a minority institution is necessary to claim rights under Article 30. The relevant portion of the said judgement is quoted as under: “29. Similarly, in S.P. Mittal v. Union of India [(1983) 1 SCC 51 : AIR 1983 SC 1], this Court held that in to claim the benefit of Article 30, the community must firstly show and prove that it is a religious or linguistic minority; and secondly, that the institution has been established by such linguistic minority.
