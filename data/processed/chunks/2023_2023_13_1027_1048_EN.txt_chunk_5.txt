The counsel relies on Section 23 of the Customs Act, 1962 to argue that granting of compensation for destroyed imported goods stored in the warehouse, is unjustifi ed. Additionally, it is also contended that the Customs Department’s demand letter lacked a statutory basis. It is therefore submitted that the insured cannot seek NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. & ORS. v. M/S. MUDIT 1035 ROADWAYS [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] indemnifi cation for the fi re loss as any such compensation would amount to unjust enrichment. 22. The learned counsel submits that the doctrine of waiver as applied in Galada Power & Telecommunication Ltd. vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd.2, had been overruled. Moreover, a legal submission can be urged at any stage of proceedings. Therefore, grounds of unjust enrichment and customs duty could still be argued before the court although they were not argued earlier. 23. Per contra, Mr. Parthiv K. Goswami, the learned senior counsel appearing for the claimant contends that the insurance company cannot be permitted to urge additional grounds beyond those mentioned in the letter of repudiation. The appellants must therefore limit their submissions to the grounds mentioned in the repudiation letter. 24. The learned counsel then submits that it is clear from the Leave & License Agreement dated 04.07.2015 that M/s Platinum Logistics had leased out land situated on Survey No.9/3 in Village – Veshvi, Taluka – Uran, Raigad to the claimant. Further, approval was sought & obtained from the Customs Department for a bonded warehouse on the same land. The insurance policy mentions the location of the insured premises as Mudit Roadways, Survey No.9/3 CPP Forbes CFS, Chirner Road, Village - Veshvi, Uran, MH1369, Maharashtra-400702. For justifying the claim, Mr. Goswami reads the two communications from the Tehsildar, Uran, Raigad dated 25.03.2018 (Annexure R-18) and 23.03.2018 (Annexure R-20) and also relies upon the telephone connection (Annexure R-16), electricity connection (Annexure R-17) and other communications from the Executive Magistrate (Annexure R-10) to point out that the fi re incident occurred in the same address of the insured ware-house. Besides, the customers who appointed their own independent surveyors (M/s Kannan & M/s Proclaim) noted that the warehouse where the stock got burnt, was located at Survey No. 9/3 (Annexure R-8). Accordingly, it is argued that there was no basis for the insurance company to contend that the fi re in the warehouse was outside the purview of the premises, covered by the insurance policy. 2 (2016) 15 SCC 161. 103 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 25. Specifi cally on the aspect of cause of fi re, Mr. Goswami contends that the welding machine & cylinders were taken away from the fi eld of view at 11.56.16 hours and the roof welding work did not continue in any case, beyond 16.04 hours on 14.03.2018. Therefore, if the sparks from the welding work were the cause of the fi re, it would not go un-noticed for 26 minutes since combustible chemicals, papers, etc. would have instaneously caught fi re.
