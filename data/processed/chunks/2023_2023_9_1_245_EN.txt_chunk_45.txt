47. Article 338(2) provides that subject to the provisions of any E law made by Parliament, the National Commission for Scheduled Caste was to consist of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman and three other Members and the conditions of service and tenure of Office, were to be such as the President, may by Rule, determine. An identical provision is contained in Article 338A(2) as regards National Commission for Scheduled Tribes. Not unnaturally, in Article 338B(2), similar provisions are contained in F regard to National Commission for Backward Classes. What is, however, pertinent to notice is Article 338(3). It provides: “The Chairperson, the Vice-Chairperson and other Members of the Commission shall be appointed by the President by warrant G under his hand and seal.” Identical provisions have been made vide Article 338A and Article 338B. 48. We would notice that pertinently, Articles 338, 338A and 338B contemplates a law to regulate the conditions of service and tenure of H 62 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A the Members of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes. Article 324(5) contemplates a law being made to regulate the conditions of service and the tenure of Office of the Election Commissioners. Most pertinently, Parliament has enacted the 1991 Act, as contemplated in Article 324(5). It is, when it comes to providing for the appointment of the Election Commissioners, B which was clearly in the contemplation of the Founding Fathers that no law has been made. The old regime continues. In regard to the Members of the National Commissions, covered by Articles 338, 338A and 338B, the Constitution is clear that the appointment is to be made by President. 49. Article 367(3) deals with the meaning of a foreign State for C the purpose of the Constitution and after declaring it to be ‘any State’ other than India, makes it, subject to a proviso, which declares that subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament, the President may, by , declare any State not to be a foreign State for such purposes, as may be specified in the . The matter is governed fully D by the Constitution (Declaration as to Foreign States) , 1950. Apart from the apparent absence of any imperative need for a law, the matter is governed by an , which is issued under the Constitution, which itself would be of a statutory nature and also issued under an enabling provision of the Constitution itself. E No further discussion is needed to conclude that Article 324(2) is unique in its setting and purpose. N.
