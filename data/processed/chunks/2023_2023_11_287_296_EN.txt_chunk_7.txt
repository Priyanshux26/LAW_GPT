296 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 21. As far as the issue of interest is concerned, interestingly, Baker had sought it pendente lite and future interest till payment @ 18% per annum besides any relief. The MMTCs reply did not refute this claim and was entirely silent on this aspect. Furthermore, no argument appears to have been addressed on the question before the tribunal, which granted 12% p.a. The s of this court, notably in Vedanta Ltd. v. Shenzhen Shandong Nuclear Power Construction Co. Ltd (hereafter, “Vedanta Ltd.”)7 have disapproved a uniform award of interest in foreign currency, and recommended that LIBOR rates plus the prevailing rate in percentage points, should be awarded. However, this court notes that on the rate of interest, there have been concurrent fi ndings; moreover, the distinction noted by Vedanta Ltd, per se does not constitute ‘patent illegality’, that vitiates the award. For instance, if the parties agree to a particular rate of interest, that would undoubtedly prevail. 22. For the above reasons, the appeals fail and are dismissed. No costs.
