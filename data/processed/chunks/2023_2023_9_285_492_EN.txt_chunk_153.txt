The State might put into place a convenient mechanism which would efface the inconsistencies in both the Arbitration Act, 1996 and the Stamp Act, 1899. If we look at the legislative intent of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and what our country is hoping to be as the destination of C choice for Arbitration, I’m of the considered opinion that it would be appropriate to interpret the statutory interplay in a constructive manner without defeating the legislative intent and thwarting the speedy referral to arbitration. 88. Following the above discussion, my opinion on the referred D issue are as follows: i) The examination of stamping and impounding need not be done at the threshold by a Court, at the pre-reference stage under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. E ii) Non-stamping/insufficient stamping of the substantive contract/instrument would not render the arbitration agreement non-existent in law and unenforceable/void, for the purpose of referring a matter for arbitration. Garware(supra) wrongly applied the principle in Hyundai(supra) to hold that an arbitration agreement would F not exist-in-law if it is unstamped/insufficiently stamped. An arbitration agreement should not be rendered void if it is suffering stamp deficiency which is a curable defect. To this extent, Garware(supra) and Hyundai(supra) do not set out the correct law. G iii) The decision in SMS Tea(supra) stands overruled. Paragraphs 22 and 29 in Garware (supra) which were approved in paragraphs 146 and 147 in Vidya Drolia(supra) are overruled to that extent.
