46. In addition to the above terminologies, the entries in the Seventh Schedule also indicate the manner in which a restriction or limitation can be imposed on the legislative powers of the State. This assumes clarity from the following tabulation: Phraseology Used Entries Declared by or under law 23, 27, 67 of List I Declared by Parliament by law 24, 52, 53, 54, 56, 62, 63, 64 of List I Imposed by Parliament by law 50 of List II 47. The Constitution deploys three expressions to signify the manner in which the legislative power could be exercised by Parliament – “declared by or under law”, and “declared by Parliament by law”, and “imposed by Parliament by law” The difference in the character of these provisions can be gathered from the Constitution (Seventh 45 South India Corporation (P) Ltd. v. Secretary, Board of Revenue [1964] 4 SCR 280 [19] 46 State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh (1952) 1 SCC 528. [“18. […] It was said that the words “subject to the provisions of List III Entry 42” must be taken to mean that the law-making power under Entry 36 could only be exercised subject to the two conditions as to public purpose and payment of compensation, both of which are referred to in Entry 42. Those words, in my opinion, mean no more than that any law made under Entry 36 by a State Legislature can be displaced or overridden by the Union Legislature making a law under Entry 42 of List III.”] 47 See Entries 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, etc., List II, Seventh Schedule, Constitution of India. 1618 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Amendment) Act 1956 which substituted the expression “declared by Parliament by law” with “declared by or under law made by Parliament” in Entry 6748 of the Union List. The object of the amendment was to enable the delegate under the statute to make the required declaration.49 The expression “by law” means that the legislative power should be effectuated through the provisions of a statute. In comparison, “by or under law” means that the legislative intent could be effectuated either through the provisions of the statute or by any subordinate authority vested with powers in that behalf by the statute.50 It is important to note that Entry 50 of List II use the expression “by law relating to mineral development”. We will have to bear the meaning of the expression “by law” in mind to give an appropriate interpretation to the entry. iii. Fiscal Federalism 48. Federalism is one of the basic features of the Indian Constitution.51 Federalism embodies a division of powers between the units of the federation, that is, the Union and the States. Indian federalism is defined as asymmetric because it tilts towards the Centre, producing a strong Central Government. Yet, it has not necessarily resulted in weak State governments.52 The Indian States are sovereigns within the legislative competence assigned to them.
