[Para 18] Interpretation of Statutes – Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 – s.89 – Overriding effect of this Act over all other food related laws – Main Section gives overriding effect to the provisions of the FSSA over any other law – Section unambiguous, aid of the title of the Section or its marginal note not to be taken to interpret the same: Held: The title of the section indeed indicates that the intention is to give an overriding effect to the FSSA over all ‘food-related laws’ – However, in the main Section, there is no such restriction confined to ‘food-related laws’, and it is provided that provisions of the FSSA shall have effect [2024] 2 S.C.R. 745 Ram Nath v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force – So, the Section indicates that an overriding effect is given to the provisions of the FSSA over any other law – The settled law is that if the main Section is unambiguous, the aid of the title of the Section or its marginal note cannot be taken to interpret the same – Only if it is ambiguous, the title of the section or the marginal note can be looked into to understand the intention of the legislature – Therefore, the main Section clearly gives overriding effect to the provisions of the FSSA over any other law in so far as the law applies to the aspects of food in the field covered by the FSSA. [Para 20] Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 – Chapter IX – ss.49- 58 – Offences and Penalties – Chapter X – Adjudication and Food Safety Appellate Tribunal – Discussed – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 – s.3 clause (zz), (a), (zx) – “unsafe food”; “adulterant”; “sub-standard”: Held: The concept of unsafe food is more comprehensive than the concept of adulterated food – Unsafe food means an article of food whose nature, substance or quality is so affected as to render it injurious to health – If any adulterant is added to an article of food, which renders the article of food injurious to health, the food article becomes unsafe food – Further, substandard food cannot be unsafe food.
