15. Pertinently, it is also to be noted that the Constitutional Bench in Neeraj Dutta v. State (Govt of NCT of Delhi)9 has answered the issue ‘whether in the absence of evidence of the complainant/direct or primary evidence of demand of illegal gratification, it is permissible to draw an inferential deduction of culpability/guilt of a public servant under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) based on other evidence adduced by the prosecution’ in affirmative, with the following conclusions: 6 A.Subair v. State of Kerala (2009) 6 SCC 587 7 [2009] 2 SCR 1021 : (2009) 3 SCC 779 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 1 8 [2014] 4 SCR 554 : (2014) 13 SCC 55 : (2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 543 9 [2023] 2 SCR 997 : (2023) 4 SCC 731 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1724 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1481 The State of Karnataka v. Chandrasha “88. What emerges from the aforesaid discussion is summarised as under: 88.1. (a) Proof of demand and acceptance of illegal gratification by a public servant as a fact in issue by the prosecution is a sine qua non in to establish the guilt of the accused public servant under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Act. 88.2. (b) In to bring home the guilt of the accused, the prosecution has to first prove the demand of illegal gratification and the subsequent acceptance as a matter of fact. This fact in issue can be proved either by direct evidence which can be in the nature of oral evidence or documentary evidence. 88.3. (c) Further, the fact in issue, namely, the proof of demand and acceptance of illegal gratification can also be proved by circumstantial evidence in the absence of direct oral and documentary evidence. 88.4. (d) In to prove the fact in issue, namely, the demand and acceptance of illegal gratification by the public servant, the following aspects have to be borne in mind: (i) if there is an offer to pay by the bribe giver without there being any demand from the public servant and the latter simply accepts the offer and receives the illegal gratification, it is a case of acceptance as per Section 7 of the Act. In such a case, there need not be a prior demand by the public servant. (ii) On the other hand, if the public servant makes a demand and the bribe giver accepts the demand and tenders the demanded gratification which in turn is received by the public servant, it is a case of obtainment. In the case of obtainment, the prior demand for illegal gratification emanates from the public servant. This is an offence under Section 13(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Act. (iii) In both cases of (i) and (ii) above, the offer by the bribe giver and the demand by the public servant respectively have to be proved by the prosecution as a fact in issue. In other words, mere acceptance or receipt of an illegal 1482 [2024] 11 S.C.R.
