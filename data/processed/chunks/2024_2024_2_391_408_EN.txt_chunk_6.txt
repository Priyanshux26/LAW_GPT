11. Per contra, it is submitted on behalf of the State that there is no infirmity in the impugned as it is based on a correct appreciation of evidence. It is further submitted that the voluntary extra judicial confession of appellant constituted crucial evidence and the fact that it led to the discovery of the dead body of the deceased, added credibility to the same. Reliance has been placed upon the decisions of this Court in Sansar Chand v. State of Rajasthan2 and Piara Singh v. State of Punjab3. It is further submitted that the Court must not consider every doubt as a reasonable doubt and minor discrepancies must not be allowed to demolish the entire testimony of a witness. In this regard, reliance has been placed upon the decisions of this Court in Mallikarjun v. State of Karnataka4 and Hari Singh & Anr. v. State of Uttar Pradesh5. 2 [2010] 12 SCR 583 : (2010) 10 SCC 604 3 [1978] 1 SCR 597 : (1977) 4 SCC 452 4 [2019] 11 SCR 609 : (2019) 8 SCC 359 5 [2021] 10 SCR 1022 : Criminal Appeal No. 186 of 2018 (SC) 400 [2024] 2 S.C.R.

Whether the testimony of PW-1 could be termed as reliable and trustworthy? iii. Whether the chain of circumstantial evidence is complete and consistent for arriving at the conclusion of guilt? 14. The conviction of the appellant is largely based on the extra judicial confession allegedly made by him before PW-1. So far as an extra judicial confession is concerned, it is considered as a weak type of evidence and is generally used as a corroborative link to lend credibility to the other evidence on record. In Chandrapal v. State of Chattisgarh6, this Court reiterated the evidentiary value of an extra judicial confession in the following words: “11. At this juncture, it may be noted that as per Section 30 of the Evidence Act, when more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession. However, this court has consistently held that an extra judicial confession is a weak kind of evidence and unless it inspires confidence or is fully corroborated by some other evidence of clinching nature, ordinarily conviction for the offence of murder should not be made only on the evidence of extra judicial confession.
