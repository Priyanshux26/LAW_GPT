The fi rst defendant only claims tenancy rights over the second schedule property and sought for protection under City Tenants Protection Act. According to the fi rst defendant, the sale deed executed by the Ameenal Beevi in favour of the plaintiff under Ex.A1 dated 30.05.1995 in respect of second schedule property, is not legally valid and it is not binding upon him. However, in to prove the same, the fi rst defendant has not produced any documents nor he proved that the original owner Ameenal Beevi had not sold the property to the plaintiff . Therefore, after purchase the second schedule property from Ameenal Beevi, MOHIDEEN ABDUL KHADAR (DEAD)THROUGH LRS. v. 171 RAHMATH BEEVI (D) THR. HER LRS. [ANIRUDDHA BOSE, J.] the plaintiff has rightly issued the quit notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act to the defendants 1 and 2 which, in the opinion of this Court, is valid since the plaintiff stepped into the shoes of Ameenal Beevi after having purchased the second schedule property and after issuing quit notice, she also terminated the tenancy. Hence, the fi rst defendants is not entitled to the benefi ts under City Tenants Protection Act. Accordingly, these issues are answered in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants.” We do not fi nd any reason to interfere with the said fi nding returned by the High Court. The High Court, in substance, retained the decision of the Trial Court in Mohideen’s Suit (O.S. No.172 of 1995) in relation to second scheduled property. As regards Rahmath Beevi’s suit (O.S. No.464 of 1995), the High Court held:- “19. In view of the above discussion, the plaintiff in O.S.No. 464 of 1995 is entitled for recovery of possession of fourth schedule of property which is also the second schedule property in O.S.No. 172 of 1995. Accordingly, the fi rst defendant in O.S.No.464 of 1995 has to pay the rent at Rs.100/- towards fourth schedule property and the second defendant has to pay Rs.50/- and the plaintiff in O.S.No.464 of 1995 is entitled to mesne profi ts at Rs.150/- from the date of the suit till the date of payable by the defendants 1 and 2.” 9. Before us, arguments were also advanced as regards locus of the petitioners to maintain these petitions. The second appeal by the High Court was decided on 25.09.2018 and the present petitions have been fi led on 03.03.2020. The petitioners are staking their claim as legatees of deceased Mohideen, who passed away on 14.06.2019. The petitioners claim that the will had been executed on 18.04.2018 bequeathing the testator’s possession and enjoyment over the second scheduled property. On behalf of the respondents, it has been argued that without proving the said testamentary instrument, the petitioners could not challenge the of the High Court in the capacity of legatees. It was further argued that tenancy could not be a subject of disposition under any testamentary instrument. So far as locus of the petitioners is concerned, this Court had allowed their plea for substitution by an passed on 31.08.2021.
