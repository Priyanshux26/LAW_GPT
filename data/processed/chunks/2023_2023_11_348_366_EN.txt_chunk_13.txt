The Power of Attorney, having been found to be invalid, any further action taken pursuant to it, cannot also be held to be valid. Therefore, the s relied upon by the defendant respondents are of no assistance to them. 31. The High Court, while exercising its power under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, exceeded its jurisdiction in disturbing the pure fi ndings of fact and that too on incorrect appreciation and reading of the pleadings. Non-framing of an issue, which is otherwise covered in a broader issue and for which there was suffi cient pleading and evidence, the suit could not have been dismissed on that ground. 32. For all the reasons recorded above, the appeal succeeds and is allowed. The impugned of the High Court is set aside and that of the First Appellate Court is maintained. The suit of the appellants stands decreed. 366 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 33. No as to costs. 34. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed.
