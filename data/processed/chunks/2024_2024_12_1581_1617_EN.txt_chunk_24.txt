It was submitted that learned Arbitrator had awarded interest for the past period, pendente lite and also future interest. Thus, learned Arbitrator had exercised his jurisdiction under Section 31(7)(a) as well as under Section 31(7)(b) of the 1996 Act. Therefore, there was no need for clarification. 50. What is therefore discernible from the above is that appellant had participated in the clarificatory proceeding before the learned Arbitrator 1614 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports taking the stand that no clarification as sought for was required on merit. 51. Learned Arbitrator issued the clarification on 15.03.2005. It was clarified that the amount awarded alongwith interest for the pre- reference and pendente lite periods become the decretal amount. As per Section 31(7)(b), this amount would carry further interest @ 18% per annum. Thus, learned Arbitrator clarified that post-award interest shall be payable on the awarded sum i.e. the amount of claim awarded (principal amount) plus interest for the pre-reference period and pendente lite upto the date of the award at the rate mentioned thereunder. 52. Appellant did not challenge the clarification dated 15.03.2005 under Section 34 of the 1996 Act; instead appellant questioned the same in the execution proceeding before the learned Single Judge. Learned Single Judge in his dated 19.02.2008 held that learned Arbitrator had become functus officio and thus had no authority to entertain the application for clarification. Learned Arbitrator, in his award, had granted simple interest @ 18% per annum on the awarded amount i.e. the principal amount from 01.04.1990 to the date of actual payment which takes care of the interest part. The decree holder (respondent herein) neither challenged the award nor sought clarification within 30 days. It is also not a case where the award debtor (appellant herein) had agreed for extension of time limit. Holding that learned Arbitrator had no authority to make any change in the award, learned Single Judge set aside the clarification. 53. When the respondent approached the Division Bench assailing the above decision of the learned Single Judge, the Division Bench held vide the dated 23.02.2012 that in view of the in S.L. Arora (supra), compound interest under the 1996 Act cannot be granted. Accordingly, challenge to the decision of the learned Single Judge was rejected. 54. When the matter came up before this Court in Civil Appeal No. 2841 of 2015 at the instance of the revenue, this Court observed that the decision in S.L. Arora (supra) has been overruled in M/s. Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. (supra) declaring that the interest component payable to the respondent shall be computed in accordance with the law laid down in M/s. Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. (supra). Both the s of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench were [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1615 North Delhi Municipal Corporation v. M/s. S.A. Builders Ltd. set aside, further clarifying that it would be open to the respondent to seek execution as per the law pronounced by this Court in M/s. Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. (supra). 55. Thereafter, the executing court i.e.
