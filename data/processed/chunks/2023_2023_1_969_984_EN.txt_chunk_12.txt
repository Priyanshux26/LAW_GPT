A Again, in Nizam & Ors. v State of Rajasthan,8 it was held as follows: “Courts below convicted the Appellants on the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 that deceased was last seen alive with the Appellants on 23.01.2001. Undoubtedly, “last seen theory” is an important link in the chain of circumstances that would B point towards the guilt of the accused with some certainty. The “last seen theory” holds the courts to shift the burden of proof to the accused and the accused to offer a reasonable explanation as to the cause of death of the deceased. It is well-settled by this Court that it is not prudent to base the C conviction solely on “last seen theory”. “Last seen theory” should be applied taking into consideration the case of the prosecution in its entirety and keeping in mind the circumstances that precede and follow the point of being so last seen.” 25. In the present case, save the “last seen” theory, there is no D other circumstance or evidence. Importantly, the time gap between when the deceased was seen in the company of the accused on 09-10-1999 and the probable time of his death, based on the post mortem report, which was conducted two days later, but was silent about the probable time of death, though it stated that death occurred approximately two E days before the post mortem, is not narrow. Given this fact, and the serious inconsistencies in the depositions of the witnesses, as well as the fact that the FIR was lodged almost 6 weeks after the incident, the sole reliance on the “last seen” circumstance (even if it were to be assumed to have been proved) to convict the accused-appellants is not justified. F 26. For the above reasons, the conviction and sentence of the appellant- accused cannot be sustained. The impugned is hereby set aside; the appellants shall be released forthwith unless required in any other case. The appeal is allowed, but without on costs. Ankit Gyan Appeal allowed.
