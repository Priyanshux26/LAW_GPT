Such was the case in Collector of Customs v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty [AIR 1962 SC 316 : (1962) 3 SCR 786] and New Central Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. Assistant Collector of Central Excise [(1970) 26 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 2 SCC 820 : AIR 1971 SC 454 : (1971) 2 SCR 92]. But where a provision of one statute is incorporated in another, the repeal or amendment of the former does not affect the latter. The effect of incorporation is as if the provision incorporated were written out in the incorporating statute and were a part of it. Legislation by incorporation is a common legislative device employed by the legislature, where the legislature for convenience of drafting incorporates provisions from an existing statute by reference to that statute instead of setting out for itself at length the provisions which it desires to adopt. Once the incorporation is made, the provision incorporated becomes an integral part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no need to refer to the statute from which the incorporation is made and any subsequent amendment made in it has no effect on the incorporation statute. Lord Esher, M.R., while dealing with legislation in incorporation in In re Wood’s Estate [(1886) 31 Ch D 607] pointed out at p. 615: “If a subsequent Act brings into itself by reference some of the clauses of a former Act, the legal effect of that, as has often been held, is to write those sections into the new Act just as if they had been actually written in it with the pen, or printed in it, and, the moment you have those clauses in the later Act, you have no occasion to refer to the former Act at all.” Lord Justice Brett, also observed to the same effect in Clarke v. Bradlough [(1881) 8 QBD 63, 69] : “.… there is a rule of construction that, where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute by a third statute does not affect the second.” This was the rule applied by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Hindustan Cooperative Insurance Society Ltd. [58 IA 259] The Judicial Committee pointed out in this case that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 having been incorporated in the Calcutta Improvement Act, 1911 and [2024] 5 S.C.R. 27 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India v. Satyanarayan Bankatlal Malu & Ors. become an integral part of it, the subsequent amendment of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by the addition of sub- section (2) in Section 26 had no effect on the Calcutta Improvement Act, 1911 and could not be read into it. Sir George Lowndes delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee observed at p. 267: “In this country it is accepted that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute does not affect the second: see the cases collected in Craies on Statute Law, 3rd Edn.
