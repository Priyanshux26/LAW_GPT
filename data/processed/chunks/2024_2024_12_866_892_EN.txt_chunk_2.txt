Supreme Court Reports THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND 3. The factual background which led the appellant to prefer the writ petition before the High Court was that he had entered into an agreement to sell a certain property located at Aurangabad. However, the said Agreement could not be performed and as such, he preferred Special Civil Suit No.274 of 2013 before the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Aurangabad, praying for a direction of specific performance of the contract. The dispute was referred to mediation under Section 89 CPC and, amicably resolved. The terms of settlement were presented to the Court and the Civil Suit was disposed of in terms of the said compromise. A request for refund of court fees was allowed only to the extent of 50%. 3.1 The appellant contended before the High Court that the learned Civil Court fell in error by allowing refund only to the extent of 50% in view Section 16 of the CFA, 1870. It was further contended that as per Section 21 of the LSA Act,1987 when a matter is referred to Lok Adalat under Section 20(1) of the said Act and a compromise or settlement is arrived at therein, the Court Fee paid in such a matter shall also be refunded in accordance with CFA, 1870. Still further it was argued that the said Act being a Central legislation, would override the State enactment.
