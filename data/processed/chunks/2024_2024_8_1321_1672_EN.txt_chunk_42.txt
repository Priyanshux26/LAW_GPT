The basis of classification must be deducible from the provisions of the statute; surrounding circumstances or matters of common knowledge.117 In making the classification, the State is free to recognize degrees of harm.118 Though the classification need not be mathematical in precision, there must be some difference between the persons grouped and the persons left out, and the difference must be real and pertinent.119 The classification is unreasonable if there is “little or no difference”.120 Second, the differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law, that is, the basis of classification must have a nexus with the object of the classification.121 b. Sub-classification as a facet of equality 80. The first issue that arises for the consideration of this Court is whether the principle of sub-classification per se violates Article 14. It is established precept that Article 14 guarantees factual and not formal equality. Thus, if persons are not similarly situated in reference to the purpose of the law, classification is permissible. The same logic of classification equally applies to sub-classification. The law can further classify a class that is already created by law for a limited purpose if it is heterogeneous for another purpose. This Court has in multiple s held that such classification within a class is valid under Article 14.122 115 State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar (1952) 1 SCC 1 116 Anwar Ali Sarkar (supra) (1952) 1 SCC 1, [Das J, 66] 117 Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri SR Tandolkar 1958 SCC OnLine SC 6, [12] 118 Ibid; Special Courts Bill, 1978, In re (1979) 1 SCC 380 119 Moorthy Match Works v. CCE (1974) 4 SCC 428 120 Deepak Sibal v. Punjab University (1989) 2 SCC 145 121 Indra Sawhney (supra) [Reddy J, 643]; State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas (1976) 2 SCC 310; Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice S.R. Tendolkar, [1959] 1 SCR 279; Budhan Choudhry v. State of Bihar [1955] 1 SCR 1045 122 State of Kerala v.

To lay down the contours of the scope of sub-classification, it needs to be determined if the class is an integrated homogenous class. In All India Station Masters & Assistant Station Master’s Association v. General Manager, Central Railways,123 the issue before a Constitution Bench of this Court was whether ‘road-side Station Masters’ could be differentiated from Guards for the purpose of promotion to the higher post of Station Masters. Answering the issue in the affirmative, this Court held that the Station Masters and Guards did not form an integrated class since they were recruited and trained separately. Thus, a distinction between the two classes was held not to be violative of the equality code which only requires the State to treat equals equally. Similarly, in Mohd. Shujat Ali v. Union of India,124 another Constitution bench of this Court held that the distinction between graduate and non-graduate Supervisors for the purpose of promotion to the post of Assistant Engineer was valid because there was no integration between the two categories.
