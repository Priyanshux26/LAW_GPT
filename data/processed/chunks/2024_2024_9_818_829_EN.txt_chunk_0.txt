[Para 12] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.113-B – Presumption as to dowry death – When: Held: When all the ingredients of ‘dowry death’ punishable u/s.304-B IPC, are proved, the presumption u/s.113-B is to be raised against the accused that he has committed the offence of ‘dowry death’ – Presumption u/s.113-B is not in respect of commission of an act of cruelty, or harassment, in connection with any demand for dowry, which is one of the essential ingredients of the offence of ‘dowry death’ – Presumption, however, is in respect of commission of the offence of ‘dowry death’ by the accused when all the essential ingredients of ‘dowry death’ are proved beyond reasonable doubt by ordinary rule of evidence, which means that to prove the essential ingredients of an offence of ‘dowry death’ the burden is on the prosecution.
