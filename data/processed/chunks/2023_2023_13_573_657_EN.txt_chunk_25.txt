During the audit, it was found that the assessee’s product merits classifi cation under CET SH 2403 9930 as ‘Zarda/Jarda scented Tobacco’. On redetermination of value under section 4 of the CE Act it was found that the assessee has short- paid excise duty by Rs. 4,28,65,508/- and accordingly, a show cause notice came to be issued under section 11A of the CE Act. The Commissioner of Central Excise, in his OIO dated 02.04.2008 confi rmed the demand of duty, interest, penalty and held that the product manufactured by the respondent- COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. AHMEDABAD v. M/S URMIN 607 PRODUCTS P. LTD. AND OTHERS [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] assessee falls under CET SH 2403 9930 as ‘Zarda/Jarda scented tobacco’ by concluding that assessment has to be made under section 4 of the CE Act. An appeal was preferred against the said before the CESTAT which came to be allowed and the OIO dated 02.04.2008 was set aside. SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES 52. We have heard the learned advocates appearing for the parties. 53. Ms. Nisha Bagchi learned counsel appearing for the Department has supported the OIO dated 02.04.2008 while contending that the tribunal committed an error in setting aside the said fi ndings and in holding that the product in question was classifi able as ‘chewing tobacco’ under CET SH 2403 9910 and rejecting the stand of the department that same should be classifi ed as ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ under CET SH 2403 9930. She would contend that the tribunal erred in relying upon its fi ndings recorded in M/s Urmin Products Private Limited which undisputedly is under challenge before this Court in Civil Appeal No. 10159-161 of 2010 (Group I) and as such it ought not to have relied upon the said . She would also contend that the tribunal erred in not considering the fact on 15.02.2007 Shri Manoj Gupta, partner of the appellant, he has admitted that perfumery compounds are added to the raw tobacco and as such product is to be classifi ed under CET SH 2403 9930 as ‘Zarda/Jarda scented tobacco’ and not ‘chewing tobacco’. 54. She would contend that prior to CETA (Amendment), 2004 came into force on 28.02.2005, ‘chewing tobacco’ and its preparations were covered under chapter 2404.41 and after the amendment the said chapter heading was classifi ed into three separate tariff items within the chapter heading 2404 namely, ‘chewing tobacco’, preparations containing ‘chewing tobacco’ and ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ and would contend all these three items were earlier classifi ed collectively under chapter heading 2404.41 and the classifi cation as it exists today clearly suggests that ‘chewing tobacco’ is not scented/fl avoured/perfumed tobacco and both the disputed items fall under diff erent and distinct classes of products. She would also submit that the assessee themselves admit that their product is ‘zarda/jarda’ and even the packed pouches bear printed description of their contents as ‘Gopal Zarda’. Reiterating the contentions raised, grounds urged and pleas put forward Civil Appeal No. 10159-161 of 2010 (M/s Urmin Products Private Limited), she prays for allowing this appeal.
