30 Statement of Manoj Rai dated 31.12.2022, under Sections 50(2) and 50(3) of the PML Act. 496 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. o Portions of these proceeds of crime were used in the Goa election campaign through multiple persons and entities. The attempt was to conceal the true nature of the proceeds of the crime and to project them as untainted money. o Part of the proceeds of crime of Rs.100,00,00,000 (rupees one hundred crore only) were transferred through a complex web of transactions through hawala route, which have been traced in spite of erasure of digital and documentary evidence.  The appellant – Manish Sisodia was unable to produce his two mobile phones out of three mobile phones used between the period 01.01.2021 to 19.08.2022. Only one phone was seized by the CBI on 19.08.2022, which was being used only since 22.07.2022. He has deliberately destroyed the evidence.  The appellant – Manish Sisodia, given his power and political clout, and being the main accused in the conspiracy, may have the evidence destroyed, and the witnesses and documents may be exposed.  Dinesh Arora’s statement to the DoE dated 14.08.2023, under Sections 50(2) and 50(3) of the PML Act, had revealed that he had taken Rs. 2,20,00,000 (rupees two crore twenty lakhs only) from Amit Arora, for the appellant – Manish Sisodia. This was on account of favourable change and tweak in the new excise policy. Analysis 8. Referring to Section 4531 of the PML Act, in Vijay Madanlal 31 Section 45 reads: “45. Off ences to be cognizable and non-bailable.—(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), no person accused of an off ence under this Act shall be released on bail or on his own bond unless— (i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release; and (ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the court is satisfi ed that there MANISH SISODIA v. CENTRAL BUREAU OF 497 INVESTIGATION [SANJIV KHANNA, J.] Choudhary (supra), the three Judges’ Bench has opined that the provision does not require that to grant bail, the court must arrive at a positive fi nding that the applicant has not committed an off ence under the PML Act. Section 45 must be construed reasonably as the intent of the legislature cannot be read as requiring the court to examine the issue threadbare and in detail to pronounce whether an accused is guilty or is entitled to acquittal. Further, an on an application for bail is passed much before the end of trial and sometimes even before commencement of trial. Lastly, it is trite, that for the purpose of considering an application for bail, although detailed reasons are not necessary to be assigned, and, therefore, the evidence need not be weighed meticulously, a tentative fi nding should be recorded on the basis of broad probabilities. The granting bail must demonstrate application of mind at least in serious cases where the applicant has been granted or denied bail.
