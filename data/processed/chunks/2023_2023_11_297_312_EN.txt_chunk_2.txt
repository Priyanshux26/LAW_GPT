AMARJEETSINGH MOHINDERSINGH 301 BASI AND OTHERS [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 6. On 19 July 2019, the appellant lodged FIR No. 806 of 2019 at PS Pimpri, Pimpri-Chinchwad against the fi rst and second respondents alleging the commission of off ences under Sections 420, 406, 409, 465, 467, 468 and 471 read with Section 34 of the IPC. The substance of the FIR was based on the inspection report prepared by the Joint Registrar (Audit) which allegedly indicated fi nancial irregularities by the offi ce bearers of the bank. 7. The High Court was moved by the fi rst and second respondents in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution for quashing the FIR. The High Court allowed the petition by its impugned dated 16 November 2021. The High Court held that Section 81(5B) contains special provisions for the submission of a special report and the obtaining of the permission of the Registrar before the lodging of an FIR. It held that these provisions would be rendered otiose if the general provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure 19734 were to apply and hence the latter must yield to the special procedure which has been prescribed under the 1960 Act. The High Court held that where the allegations in regard to the commission of off ences are solely based on an audit which has been conducted under Section 81, the peremptory procedure prescribed in Section 81(5B) must be scrupulously followed.
