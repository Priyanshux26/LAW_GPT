[Paras 13, 58-60] Sentence/Sentencing – Murder – Remission – Commutation of death penalty to life imprisonment, however convict cannot be released on the expiry of 14 years (the normal benchmark for life imprisonment) – Aggravating and mitigating circumstances – Appropriate period of sentence to be imposed under the Swamy Shraddananda principle – Relevant factors for arriving at the number of years which the convict will have to undergo before which remission could be sought: Held: Once the court decides that the death penalty is not to be imposed and also that the convict cannot be released on the expiry of 14 years, the guidelines set out in Swamy Shraddananda, V. Sriharan and the line of cases which applied these s will have to be considered and principles, if any, set out therein have to be applied – There can be no straitjacket formulae – Pegging the point up to which remission powers cannot be invoked is an exercise that has to be carefully undertaken and the discretion should be exercised on reasonable grounds – The principle in Swamy Shraddananda as affirmed in V. Sriharan was evolved as [2024] 3 S.C.R. 915 Navas @ Mulanavas v. State of Kerala the normally accepted norm of 14 years was found to be grossly disproportionate on the lower side – At the same time, since it is a matter concerning the liberty of the individual, courts should also guard against any disproportion in the imposition, on the higher side too – A delicate balance has to be struck – 27 previously decided cases applying the Swamy Shraddananda principle, surveyed – A journey through the cases shows that the fundamental underpinning is the principle of proportionality – The aggravating and mitigating circumstances which the Court considers while deciding commutation of penalty from death to life imprisonment, have a large bearing in deciding the number of years of compulsory imprisonment without remission, too – Some of the relevant factors that the courts bear in mind for arriving at the number of years which the convict will have to undergo before which the remission powers could be invoked are number of deceased who were victims of that crime, their age and gender; the nature of injuries including sexual assault if any; the motive for which the offence was committed; whether the offence was committed when the convict was on bail in another case; the premeditated nature of the offence; the relationship between the offender and the victim; the abuse of trust if any; the criminal antecedents; and whether the convict, if released, would be a menace to the society – Some of the positive factors are age of the convict; the probability of reformation of convict; the convict not being a professional killer; the socioeconomic condition of the accused; the composition of the family of the accused and conduct expressing remorse – Additionally, the Court would be justified in considering the conduct of the convict in jail; and the period already undergone – Aforesaid factors not exhaustive but illustrative and each case would depend on the facts and circumstances therein.
