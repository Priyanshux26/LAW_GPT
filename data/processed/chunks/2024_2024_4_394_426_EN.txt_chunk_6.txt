[2024] 4 S.C.R. 403 Karikho Kri v. Nuney Tayang and Another 8. Whether the nature of non-disclosure alleged by the Election petitioner is of a substantial nature effecting the election of the returned candidate/respondent No. 1? 9. What consequential relief the petitioner is entitled to, if any?’ 8. Nuney Tayang examined 7 witnesses, including himself as PW7. Karikho Kri examined 39 witnesses, including himself as DW1A. Dr. Mohesh Chai did not choose to contest the case before the High Court, despite service of notice. Before us, however, he is duly represented by learned counsel and also filed his replies in both the appeals. 9. The High Court held against Karikho Kri on Issue No 1, in relation to three out of the four vehicles, viz., the Kinetic Zing Scooty bearing No. AR-11/4474 and the Maruti Omni Van bearing No. AR-11A/3100, both registered in the name of Bagilu Kri, his wife, and the TVS Star City Motorcycle bearing No. AR-11/6851, registered in the name of Goshinso Kri, his second son. The High Court was of the opinion that, notwithstanding the sale of the Kinetic Zing Scooty bearing No. AR- 11/4474 in 2009 and the Maruti Omni Van bearing No. AR-11A/3100 in the year 2017 and the gifting of the TVS Star City Motorcycle bearing No. AR-11/6851 in 2014, these vehicles continued to stand in the names of Bagilu Kri and Goshinso Kri, the dependent wife and son of Karikho Kri, on the relevant date. Upon considering the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for brevity, ‘the Act of 1988’) and the decision of this Court in Naveen Kumar vs. Vijay Kumar and others1, the High Court concluded that the person in whose name the motor vehicle stood registered should be treated as the owner thereof. In consequence, it was held that, as on the date of presentation of his nomination on 22.03.2019 and its scrutiny on 26.03.2019, the above three vehicles were owned by the dependent wife and son of Karikho Kri but they were not disclosed in the Affidavit in Form No. 26 filed by him. 10. On Issue No. 4 with regard to non-submission of a ‘No Dues Certificate’ in the context of electricity and water charges, etc., that was required to be submitted under Clause 8(ii)(B) of Form No. 26, 1 [2018] 2 SCR 572 : (2018) 3 SCC 1 404 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the High Court noted that Karikho Kri had occupied government accommodation in MLA Cottage No.1 at ‘E’ Sector, Itanagar, from 2009 to 2014, as the MLA of Tezu (ST) Assembly Constituency during those years. According to Karikho Kri, he lost the election in 2014 and vacated the said accommodation. He claimed that when he filed his nomination for the Assembly Election in 2014, he obtained a ‘No Dues Certificate’ after clearing the dues and submitted it. As there were no outstanding dues thereafter and he did not occupy government accommodation, he stated that he did not disclose the same.
