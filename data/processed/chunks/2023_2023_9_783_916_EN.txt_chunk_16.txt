Before proceeding further, another ancillary aspect may also be usefully referred to, which has also formed a part of contentions in these appeals. It relates to another settlement proposal of the promoter. It is noticed that while the proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority were pending, the promoter, again, on 08.03.2021, submitted a settlement C proposal to TFCI and sought consequent withdrawal of CIRP under Section 12-A of the Code; and also submitted a ‘letter of support’ dated 14.07.2021 issued by one Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences addressed to the CoC to demonstrate its ability and bonafide in support of its withdrawal proposal. However, the said support was subsequently withdrawn by Mr. Veerayan, the President of the said D Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences. 13. Having taken note of the basic background aspects in relation to the initiation of CIRP and CoC meetings as also the ancillary matters, we may now examine the decision of the Adjudicating Authority leading to the approval of the resolution plan in question in necessary details.
