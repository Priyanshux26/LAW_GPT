Case No. 2380 of 2004, decided on 13-8-2007 (Del)] whereby the High Court held that the proceedings against the appellant can be continued even in absence of the Company. We, accordingly, set aside that part of the impugned dated 13-8-2007 [Visionaries Media Network v. Star India (P) Ltd., Criminal Misc. Case No. 2380 of 2004, decided on 13-8-2007 (Del)] passed by the High Court so far as it relates to the appellant and quash the summons and proceeding pursuant to Complaint Case No. 698 of 2001 qua the appellant.” (Emphasis supplied) 1992 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 61. This Court’s decision in Ashok Shewakramani and Others v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Another reported in (2023) 8 SCC 473 acknowledged the normal rule that there cannot be any vicarious liability under a penal provision but however, held that Section 141 of the NI Act is an exception to this rule. It further stated that vicarious liability would only be fastened when the person who is sought to be held vicariously liable was “in charge of” and “responsible to the Company” for the conduct of the business of the Company at the time when the offence under Section 138 was committed. In circumstances where such persons are indeed found vicariously liable, those persons as well as the Company shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence under Section 138 of the NI Act. The relevant observations made by the Court are reproduced hereinbelow: “21. Section 141 is an exception to the normal rule that there cannot be any vicarious liability when it comes to a penal provision. The vicarious liability is attracted when the ingredients of sub-section (1) of Section 141 are satisfied. The section provides that every person who at the time the offence was committed was in charge of, and was responsible to the Company for the conduct of business of the Company, as well as the Company shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence under Section 138 of the NI Act.” (Emphasis supplied) 62. It follows from a conspectus of the aforesaid decisions that it is the drawer Company which must be first held to be the principal offender under Section 138 of the NI Act before culpability can be extended, through a deeming fiction, to the other Directors or persons in-charge of and responsible to the Company for the conduct of its business. In the absence of the liability of the drawer Company, there would naturally be no requirement to hold the other persons vicariously liable for the offence committed under Section 138 of the NI Act. 63. Before we part with the matter, we deem it necessary to address the argument advanced by the counsel appearing for the accused that the object of Section 138 of the NI Act would be defeated if cases like the present one are held to be excluded from the ambit of the provision. The counsel placed reliance on a decision rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court in [2024] 12 S.C.R.
