As an industrial dispute was raised by him, the appropriate Government referred the dispute for adjudication by the Industrial Tribunal. The Tribunal passed an award on 6-2-1993 and reduced the punishment imposed [2024] 4 S.C.R. 111 M/S Bharti Airtel Limited v. A.S. Raghavendra the appellant contends the said decision squarely covers the case, but has not been accepted by the learned Single Judge. by the employer. The said was assailed before the High Court in the writ petition. Before the High Court, the decision in M. Venugopal v. LIC [(1994) 2 SCC 323 : 1994 SCC (L&S) 664 : (1994) 27 ATC 84] was cited. The High Court opined that the said decision was not applicable and placed reliance on the authority in S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] . Thereafter, the Court referred to the jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal in interfering with the quantum of punishment and after referring to various provisions of the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, opined that it is “State” and on that basis ruled thus : (R. Suresh case [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] , SCC p. 328, paras 35-36) “35. The jurisdiction of the Industrial Court being wide and it having been conferred with the power to interfere with the quantum of punishment, it could go into the nature of charges, so as to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the respondent had misused his position or his acts are in breach of trust conferred upon him by his employer. 36. It may be true that quantum of loss may not be of much relevance as has been held in Suresh Pathrella v. Oriental Bank of Commerce [(2006) 10 SCC 572 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 612 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 224] , but there again a question arose as to whether he was in the position of trust or not.” 13. At this juncture, we are obliged to state that the two-Judge Bench in R. Suresh case [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] referred to the decision in S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] and also stated that they were not unmindful of the principle stated in Mukesh K. Tripathi [(2004) 8 SCC 387 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1128] . Dealing with the decision in Mukesh K. Tripathi [(2004) 8 SCC 387 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1128] , the Court said that there the question was whether the Apprentice Development Officer would be a “workman” within the meaning of the provisions of Section 2(s) of the Act and observed that it was not dealing with the case that pertains to an apprentice. 14. Mr Singh, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant built the plinth of his argument on the basis of the aforesaid authority with the hope that an enormous structure would come into existence but as we find on a studied and anxious reading of the , we notice that there is no reference to the Constitution Bench decision in H.R.
