C Thus, total number of vacancies in the cadre strength would include the vacancies to be filled in by nomination as well as by promotion. In fact, this was the view adopted by the Bombay High Court discussed aforesaid in National Confederation for Development of Disabled v. Union of India [National D Confederation for Development of Disabled v. Union of India, 2015 SCC OnLine Bom 5112] with the challenge raised to the same in a SLP being rejected in Union of India v. National Confederation for Development of Disabled [Union of India v. National Confederation for Development of Disabled, (2015) 13 SCC 643 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 276] . We may note E the observations in Rajeev Kumar Gupta v. Union of India [Rajeev Kumar Gupta v. Union of India, (2016) 13 SCC 153 : (2017) 2 SCC (L&S) 605] in para 24 to the effect : (Rajeev Kumar Gupta case [Rajeev Kumar Gupta v. Union of India, (2016) 13 SCC 153 : (2017) 2 SCC (L&S) 605] , F SCC p. 162) “24. … Once the post is identified, it must be reserved for PwD irrespective of the mode of recruitment adopted by the State for filling up of the said post.” (emphasis supplied) G and a direction was issued to the Government to extend 3% reservation to PwD in all identified posts in Group A and Group B “irrespective of the mode of filling up of such posts”. ***************** H 820 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A II. Whether reservation under Section 33 of the 1995 Act is dependent upon identification of posts as stipulated by Section 32? 21. On a plea of the learned Amicus Curiae, which we unhesitatingly accept, there can be little doubt that it was B never the intention of the legislature that the provisions of Section 32 would be used as a tool to frustrate the benefits of reservation under Section 33. In fact, identification of posts for purposes of reservation had to take place immediately after the 1995 Act. A resistance to such reservation is obvious from the delaying tactics adopted by most of the Government C authorities in truly implementing the intent. It thus shows that sometimes it is easier to bring a legislation into force but far more difficult to change the social mindset which would endeavour to find ways and means to defeat the intent of the Act enacted and Section 32 was a classic example of the same. D In Union of India v. Ravi Prakash Gupta [Union of India v. Ravi Prakash Gupta, (2010) 7 SCC 626 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 448] also, this Court mandated the identification of posts for purposes of reservation. Thus, what is required is identification of posts in every establishment until exempted under proviso to Section 33. No doubt the identification of E the posts was a prerequisite to appointment, but then the appointment cannot be frustrated by refusing to comply with the prerequisite. This view was affirmed by a larger Bench of three Judges in Union of India v. National Federation of the Blind [Union of India v. National Federation of the Blind, F (2013) 10 SCC 772 : (2014) 2 SCC (L&S) 257].” III.
