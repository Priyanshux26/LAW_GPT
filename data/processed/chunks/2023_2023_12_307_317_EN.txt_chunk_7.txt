Moreover, before the Referee Judge, the dispute centred around the decision taken by the Registrar after the Division Bench had delivered the on 14.01.2016 and it formed a fresh cause of action. 14. On behalf of the respondents, it has been submitted that the FIR No.673/2010 dated 19.10.2010 in which the same allegation of forged signatures was made stood closed with submission of fi nal report by the Investigating Offi cer before the concerned court. It has been submitted before us that the person accused in the criminal case (respondent no.14) has been discharged by the ACJM, Sealdah by an passed on 07.04.2021. But this fact, in our opinion, does not conclude the dispute and in any event closure CHEN KHOI KUI v. LIANG MIAO SHENG & ORS. 317 [ANIRUDDHA BOSE, J.] report cannot result in fi nal determination of the dispute between two sets of parties on the adjudication of allegations of fi ling false and fabricated documents before the Registrar of Societies. Otherwise, the respondents have defended the which is under appeal before us. 15. We are of the view that the impugned does not suff er from any legal shortcoming warranting our interference. 16. It has also been argued before us that Chinese Tannery Owners’ Association is the owner of the land where the subject school is located. On this point, we would add that in the event the respondents cannot demonstrate their right to run the school on the land owned by the said Association without their permission, that factor may also be taken into consideration by the Registrar and that could also be a ground for cancellation of registration. But any decision on that count shall be subject to fi nal adjudication by the civil court if an action on that count is pending before the civil court. 17. The present appeal shall stand disposed of in the above terms. 18. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. 19. There shall be no as to costs.
