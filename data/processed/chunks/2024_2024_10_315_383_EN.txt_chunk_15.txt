16.3 In Dinesh Kumar v. Airport Authority of India,23 Lodha, J. (as he then was) observed: “10. In our view, invalidity of sanction where sanction exists, can be raised on diverse grounds like non-availability of material before the sanctioning authority or bias of the sanctioning authority or the of sanction having been passed by an 22 [2006] Supp. 10 SCR 197 : (2007) 1 SCC 1 23 [2011] 13 SCR 260 : (2012) 1 SCC 532 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 339 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. authority not authorised or competent to grant such sanction. The above grounds are only illustrative and not exhaustive. All such grounds of invalidity or illegality of sanction would fall in the same category like the ground of invalidity of sanction on account of non-application of mind—a category carved out by this Court in Parkash Singh Badal [(2007) 1 SCC 1 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 193] , the challenge to which can always be raised in the course of trial.” 16.4 In Central Bureau of Investigation & Ors. v. Pramila Virendra Kumar Agarwal,24 while referring to Dinesh Kumar (supra), this Court reiterated the distinction between absence of sanction and the alleged invalidity of sanction on account of non-application of mind. It was held that absence as in issue can be raised at the threshold, however, invalidity, as in issue can only be raised at trial. 16.5 A Bench of three learned Judges in P.K. Pradhan v.

But there may be certain cases where it may not be possible to decide the question effectively without giving opportunity to the defence to establish that what he did was in discharge of official duty. In to come to the conclusion whether claim of the accused that the act that he did was in course of the performance of his duty was a reasonable one and neither pretended nor fanciful, can be examined during the course of trial by giving opportunity to the defence to establish it. In 24 (2020) 17 SCC 664 25 [2001] 3 SCR 1119 : (2001) 6 SCC 704 26 Hereinafter ‘CrPC’ 340 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports such an eventuality, the question of sanction should be left open to be decided in the main which may be delivered upon conclusion of the trial.” (Emphasis supplied) 16.6 In recent past, this court, in State of Karnataka v.
