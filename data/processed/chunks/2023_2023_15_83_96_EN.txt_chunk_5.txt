Subsequently, both the convicts surrendered today before this Court. Accordingly, both the convicts are taken into custody. Let both the convicts namely Sanjit Saha and Anil Saha be sent to Raiganj District Correctional Home at once. The Superintendent of Raiganj District Correctional Home is directed to take necessary steps as per direction of the Hon’ble High Court. Let a copy of this along with the copy of dated 05-07-2018 passed by the Hon’ble High Court be sent to the Raiganj District Correctional Home for information and taking necessary action. Issue Jail Warrant accordingly. B.C.I-I to comply. Recall W/A at once.” 10. A custody certifi cate from the Offi ce of the Superintendent, Balurghat Central Correctional Home has also been placed before me. The custody certifi cate also shows that the petitioner no.2 had surrendered on 15.03.2019 and was admitted to Balurghat Central Correctional Home on 17.03.2019. 11. Most importantly, the custody certificate carries the remark that petitioner no.2-Anil Saha has expired on 26.05.2023 and as per the postmortem report, the cause of death was due to the eff ect of diseased condition of organs – a natural cause. The custody certifi cate also shows that the petitioner no.2 had undergone a period of about four years two months and eleven days sentence at the time of his death. 12. From the facts in para 1 to 11 above, the following aspects clearly emerge: i. Firstly, in obedience to the of this Court dated 01.03.2019 and well within the time granted by this Court, petitioner no.2 - Anil Saha (like petitioner No.1 – Sanjit Saha) surrendered on 15.03.2019. 92 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. ii. Secondly, petitioner No. 1 - Sanjit Saha has taken steps to move an application for recall pointing out that soon after surrender he had informed his counsel, who for various reasons including the fact that the counsel’s death happened on 10.04.2021 could not report the fact of surrender to this Court. iii. Thirdly, this has resulted in the peremptory dismissal of the Special Leave Petitions since no surrender proof was fi led within two weeks from the dated 24.02.2020. The situation was in spite of surrendering to custody on 15.03.2019, for want of communication, the Special Leave Petitions of both petitioners also stood peremptorily dismissed as per the of 24.02.2020. iv. Lastly, it was only while ing the restoration of the Special Leave Petition of petitioner no.1 and on the ing of an enquiry, it has surfaced that the petitioner no.2 has in fact surrendered on 15.03.2019. 13. As pointed out earlier, Petitioner No.1 Sanjit Saha has fi led an application for recall. His Special Leave Petition has already been restored vide In-Chambers dated 25.09.2023. In all likelihood, Petitioner No.2 Anil Saha, also, must have also communicated the same, since the counsel was the same. Counsel was not present before the Judge In-Chambers on 24.02.2020. It has also come on record that unfortunately the counsel had also passed away on 10.04.2021. 14. Petitioner no.2 – Anil Saha has passed away on 26.05.2023 and he has not been able to avail the Constitutional remedy of appeal by special leave, which he was legitimately entitled to, since he had surrendered on 15.03.2019 and as such was entitled to a hearing on his Special Leave Petition.
