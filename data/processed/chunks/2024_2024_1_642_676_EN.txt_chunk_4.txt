The assessing officer held that the total receipt from sale of weeklies and periodicals came to Rs.7,62,94,757.00. The profit earned before depreciation at the rate of 7.50% on the turnover came to Rs.57,22,106.00. In respect of the daily newspaper, the assessing officer worked out the loss at Rs.22,95,872.00 as against the loss of Rs.41,23,500.00 claimed by the assessee. Taking an overall view of the matter, the assessing officer estimated the business income of the assessee during the assessment year 1992-1993 at Rs.10,00,000.00 vide the assessment dated 26.03.1993 passed under Section 143(3) of the Act. 11. It may be mentioned that for the assessment year 1993-1994, the assessee had submitted the profit and loss account as well as the balance sheet along with the return of income. While examining the balance sheet, the assessing officer noticed that the balance in the capital account of all the partners of the assessee firm together was Rs.1,85,75,455.00 as on 31.03.1993 whereas the capital of the partners as on 31.12.1985 was only Rs.2,55,117.00. According to the assessing officer, none of the partners had any other source of income apart from one of the partners, Smt. Cleramma Vargese, who had a business under the name and style of “Mangalam Finance”. As the income assessed for all the years was found to be not commensurate with the increase in the capital by Rs.1,83,20,338.00 (Rs.1,85,75,455.00 – Rs.2,55,117.00) from 1985 to 1993, it was considered necessary to reassess the income of the assessee as well as that of the partners for the assessment years 1988-1989 to 1993-1994. After obtaining the approval of the Commissioner of Income Tax, Trivandrum, notice under Section 148 of the Act was issued and served upon the assessee on 29.03.2000. 12. In respect of the assessment year 1990-1991, the assessee informed the assessing officer that the return of income filed which culminated in the assessment dated 29.01.1992 may be considered as the return in the reassessment proceedings. The assessing officer took cognizance of the profit and loss account and the balance sheet filed [2024] 1 S.C.R. 649 M/S Mangalam Publications, Kottayam v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Kottayam by the assessee before the South Indian Bank on the basis of which assessment of income for the assessment years 1988 - 1989 and 1989 - 1990 were completed. Objection of the assessee that the aforesaid balance sheet was prepared only for the purpose of obtaining loan from the South Indian Bank and therefore could not be relied upon for income tax assessment was brushed aside. The reassessment was made on the basis of the accounts submitted to the South Indian Bank. By the reassessment dated 21.03.2002 passed under Section 144/147 of the Act, the assessing officer quantified the total income of the assessee at Rs.29,66,910.00 whereafter was passed allocating income among the partners. 13.
