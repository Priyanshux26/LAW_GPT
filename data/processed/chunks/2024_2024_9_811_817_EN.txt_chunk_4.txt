However, in present case, considering the statements by witnesses indicating abuse and torture of deceased by her in-laws and other factual circumstances, prima facie case is made against the accused persons. Thus, it would be travesty of justice to put a complete stop on criminal proceedings. Further, the trial shall give adequate opportunity to the accused respondents to defend themselves. 20. This court in CBI v. Aryan Singh1 has held that, “10. As per the cardinal principle of law, at the stage of discharge and/or quashing of the criminal proceedings, while exercising the powers under Section 482 Cr. P.C., the Court is not required to conduct the mini trial. 1 [2023] 2 SCR 819 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 379 [2024] 9 S.C.R. 817 Ranjeet Mittal v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. Etc. Etc. At the stage of discharge and/or while exercising the powers under Section 482 Cr. P.C., the Court has a very limited jurisdiction and is required to consider “whether any sufficient material is available to proceed further against the accused for which the accused is required to be tried or not”. 21. Thus, at this stage, we do not deem it necessary to delve into the discussion of whether there is sufficient evidence to fulfil the requirements of particular sections of Indian Penal Code charged against the Respondents. The trial court shall decide whether charges are proved or not in due course. Given the statements of witnesses, suspicious circumstances around death of deceased and gravity of offense, we are of the opinion that the trial needs to be conducted to reach to the truth. Criminal proceedings against accused Respondent No. 2 to 5 shall be thus continued. 22. The High Court erred in quashing the of trial court framing charges. Accordingly, the Criminal Appeals are allowed and the s passed by High Court for Judicature of Madhya Pradesh at Gwalior in Criminal Revision No.5766 of 2019, Criminal Revision No. 5767 of 2019 and Criminal Revision 5768 of 2019 are set aside. The trial will proceed as per law from the stage of framing of charges. It is however, made clear that any other observations made in this shall not influence the Trial Court which shall proceed with the trial and decide the same on the basis of evidence led before it. 23. Criminal Appeals Nos. 003680 – 003682 of 2024 stand allowed as above. Result of the Case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
