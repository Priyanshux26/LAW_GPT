The said Company was the predecessor-in-interest of the appellants-defendants. The property was put to auction for recovery of loan availed by the owners. The same was purchased by Mrs. S. Bharwani in the auction. Sale deed was registered in her favour on 24.6.1978. The respondent-plaintiff had purchased the property from Mrs. S. Bharwani. Finally, the lease in favour of the appellants expired on 31.12.1997. Thereafter, as pleaded, the respondent-plaintiff issued notice to the appellants seeking possession. The same having not been done, the fi rst suit fi led by the respondent-plaintiff was decreed 30.10.2010. During the pendency of the fi rst suit, the appellants-defendants sought to invoke Section 9 of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act, 1921 claiming right to purchase the property, but failed in that process as well. In the fi rst suit fi led by the respondent- plaintiff , the prayer was only for seeking possession of the property. In the 6 6 ILR (1976) 1 P&H 120 7 AIR 1964 SC 1810 M/S BHARAT PETROLEUM CORPORATION LTD. AND ANR. v. 865 ATM CONSTRUCTIONS PVT. LTD.

It was on the ground that a subsequent suit only for claiming damages for use and occupation of the property in dispute, for which a suit for possession was fi led earlier without claiming any damages for use and occupation, will not be maintainable in terms of II Rule 2 C.P.C. 11. The primary issue which requires consideration by this Court to appreciate the arguments regarding maintainability of the subsequent suit is with reference to cause of action. The fi rst suit was fi led by the respondent for possession, whereas the second suit was fi led for damages for use and occupation of the property after expiry of the lease period. 12. Paragraphs in the two suits mentioning the cause of action are extracted below: “Suit for possession “XXI. The plaintiff submits that after the statutory intervention, the fi rst renewal period by virtue of Section 5 & 7 of the Burma-Shell Acquisition of Undertakings in India Act, the defendants got the lease deed executed for a period of 20 years from 01.01.1978. The said fi rst renewal period expired on 31.12.1997.
