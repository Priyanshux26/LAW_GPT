This court finds them guilty of committing the murder of Manish Sahni in furtherance of their E common intention.” 8. The three convicts before us i.e., the respondents Nos. 1, 3 and 4 respectively prayed before the High Court that they be released on bail pending the final disposal of their appeals by suspending the substantive of sentence of life imprisonment. F 9. The High Court suspended the substantive of sentence of all the three convicts and ed their release on bail vide the impugned dated 16.09.2022. The High Court observed thus: “By the impugned and of conviction dated 12.03.2021 and of sentence dated 15.03.2021 passed G by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-VII, Vaishali at Hajipur, in Sessions Trial No. 280/2019 arising out of Jandaha P.S. Case No. 202/2018, the appellant has been convicted and sentenced as under: H 150 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A B C D 75 per cent of the fine amount has been ed to be paid to the widow of deceased Manish Sahni, namely, Rup Kala Devi and 25 per cent of the amount has been ed to be paid to the State of Bihar. In compliance of this Court’s dated 03.08.2022, E the State has filed a written objection in terms of the first proviso to Section 389(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. We have heard Mr. Vasant Vikas, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant in Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 322 of 2021; Mr. Sanjay Singh, learned Senior Counsel F appearing on behalf of the appellant in Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 411 of 2021 and learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants have submitted that for the occurrence said to have taken G place at 03:00 pm, at a public place, on 13.08.2018, the First Information Report came to be registered on 14.08.2018, based on written report of the informant (P.W.-7) submitted at 01:00 pm. The informant has claimed to be an eye-witness of the occurrence. However, there is no explanation for the late H submission of the written report, naming these appellants as OMPRAKASH SAHNI v. JAI SHANKAR CHAUDHARY & 151 ANR. ETC. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] the assailants. It has been argued that it is evident from the A First Information Report that political rivalry between the deceased and these appellants has been disclosed as the reason why the deceased was killed by these appellants. They accordingly submit that disclosure of names of these appellants in the First Information Report, as the main assailants, is an B afterthought and in that background, the late registration of First Information Report casts a serious doubt on the veracity of the prosecution’s case. It has, further, been argued that though (P.W.-7), the informant, has claimed to be an eye- witness to the occurrence, who had carried the deceased in the injured condition to a nearby hospital and thereafter to C Sadar hospital, after the deceased was declared dead in a private hospital; his own deposition contradicts this version as asserted in the First Information Report inasmuch as in response to a question during the course of cross-examination, he admitted that he had not gone to the Sadar hospital with D the deceased.
