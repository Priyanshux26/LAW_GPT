14. There is one more plausible reason for us to turn down the appellant’s claim for the higher rate of Rs.297 per sq. yard. We have condoned the delay of nearly 13 years in fi ling of their fi rst appeals, only to accord parity between the similarly placed land-owners on the anvil of Article 14 of the Constitution. If the appellants are granted compensation higher than their co-landowners, despite the fact that such counterparts were vigilant in pursuing their remedy promptly, it will lead to hostile discrimination viz those landowners whose fate already stands sealed upto this Court. This will also amount to granting premium on, what can be aptly termed as stale, belated and chance claim of the appellants. 15. Having held so, the appeals are allowed in part; the appellants are held entitled to compensation at the rate of Rs.150 per sq. yard for their respective acquired land. However, the compensation amount shall not include statutory interest, including on solatium, as per the rate prescribed under Section 34 of the Act, for the period from the date of passing of the award by the Reference Court under Section 18 of the Act till the fi ling of 848 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. the respective fi rst appeals before the High Court. The appellants shall be required to make good the defi ciency in Court Fees before the High Court within four weeks, whereupon only the arrears of enhanced compensation shall be paid to them within eight weeks thereafter. 16. ed accordingly.
