We hold back noting that justice ought to be tempered with mercy. POST-SCRIPT: 24. It is sad that even today, this Court is forced to restate the principles and directions in D K Basu (supra). Before D K Basu (supra), this Court had expressed its concern as to how best to safeguard the dignity of the individual and balance the same with interests of the State or investigative agency in Prem Shankar Shukla v Delhi Administration, (1980) 3 SCC 526. In Bhim Singh, MLA v State of Jammu and Kashmir, (1985) 4 SCC 677, this Court noted that police officers are to exhibit greatest regard for personal liberty of citizens and restated the sentiment in Sunil Gupta v State of Madhya Pradesh, (1990) 3 SCC 119. The scenario in Delhi Judicial Service Association v State of Gujarat, (1991) 4 SCC 406 prompted this Court to come down heavily on excess use of force by the police. As such, there will be a general direction to the police forces in all States and Union Territories as also all agencies endowed with the power of arrest and custody to scrupulously adhere to all Constitutional and statutory safeguards and the additional guidelines laid down by this Court when a person is arrested by them and/or remanded to their custody.
