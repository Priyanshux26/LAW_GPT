The impugned goes on to state that respondent no.1 was not involved in the affairs of the Society nor was he responsible for the irregularities alleged. At the present stage, where the charge-sheet stands filed, it emerges that there is some material indicative of the involvement of respondent no.1 in the withdrawal of ₹9,00,00,000/- (Rupees Nine Crores), based on the records and cash-book entries and other book of accounts though he had invested amounts only 11 (2022) 9 SCC 321 12 (2001) 9 SCC 338 13 [2008] 6 SCR 1149 : (2008) 13 SCC 584 766 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports to the tune of about ₹2,38,00,000/- (Rupees Two Crores Thirty Eight Lakhs). Even the Forensic Audit Report exhibits material to this effect. 24. We bear in mind the submission that respondent no.1 was a close associate of the President of the Society with regular business/other dealings between the two. Investigation also indicates that out of the monies withdrawn from the Society’s account by the respondent no.1, investments were later made in property in the name of his relatives. Further, the High Court has completely lost sight of the fact that the deposits in/to the Society were made by people having meagre earnings without anything else to fall back upon. Tentatively speaking, it seems that the President of the Society systematically siphoned off these funds, with the aid of other office-bearers as also through respondent no.1. We consciously refrain from elaborately discussing/detailing the evidence or our views thereon following the dicta in Niranjan Singh v Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote, (1980) 2 SCC 559; Vilas Pandurang Pawar v State of Maharashtra, (2012) 8 SCC 795 and Atulbhai Vithalbhai Bhanderi v State of Gujarat, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 560. 25. In cases where the allegations coupled with the materials brought on record by the investigation and in the nature of economic offence affecting a large number of people reveal the active role of the accused seeking anticipatory or regular bail, it would be fit for the Court granting such bail to impose appropriately strict and additional conditions. In the present case, even that has not been done as the High Court has imposed usual conditions simpliciter: “8. The applicant be released on bail in connection with Crime 217/2019, registered with Police Station Kotwali, Nagpur, for offences punishable under sections 409, 420, 467, 478, 471, 120-B of Indian Penal Code, Section 3 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act, on executing PR bond of Rs. 16,000/- (Rupees Sixteen Thousand) with one solvent surety of the like amount. 9. The applicant shall attend Economic Offences Wing, Nagpur as and when required by the Investigating Officer. 10. The applicant shall not, directly or indirectly, make any attempt to influence the witnesses or otherwise tamper with the evidence. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 767 Manik Madhukar Sarve & Ors. v. Vitthal Damuji Meher & Ors. 11. The applicant shall not leave the country without the permission of the trial Court.” (emphasis supplied) 26.
