We would hasten to add that Civil Appeals relating to challenge of acquisition of larger area (456 acres) is still pending before the court and sufficient safeguards to protect the interest of the State can be taken care of at the time of passing final . Necessarily, the issuance of TDR as per TDR Rules would be subject to final outcome of Civil Appeals and as such filing of an undertaking by the recipients of TDR as opined by our dated 19.03.2024 is not warranted. Hence, we deem it proper to delete the additional condition imposed by this Court by dated 19.03.2024 and making it explicitly clear that TDR issued by the competent authority would be subject to final s that may be passed in Civil Appeals pending before larger bench and this would have no bearing on the pending appeals. 20.1 Though, initially there was resistance to the dated 21.11.2014 and 17.05.2022, the State and its machinery seems to have understood the gravity of the situation and to fall in line with the further directions issued by this Court, has made a feeble attempt on 19.03.2024 to demonstrate before this Court of having complied with the s passed by this Court which is alleged to have been wilfully disobeyed by the contemnors. After having dragged their feet for the last 10 years and having exhausted all remedies to stave off the s dated 21.11.2024, 17.05.2022 and 19.03.2024, the respondent authorities or contemnors have filed affidavits by stating thereunder that s of this Court have been complied. The affidavits dated 09.07.2024 filed by Shri Uma Shankar Additional Chief Secretary, Urban Development Department, Government of Karnataka- Respondent No.1 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1313 Chaduranga Kanthraj Urs and Anr. v. P. Ravi Kumar and Ors. would indicate that the deponent is depicting the picture of having complied with the s dated 21.11.2014 and 17.05.2022 without any whisper with regard to the dated 19.03.2024. In fact the deponent has relied upon the Government No. DPAR 68 PSR 2024 dated 24.05.2024 whereunder the TDR for 15 acres 17.5 guntas has been resolved to be issued to the complainants by determining the value as per the BPAT Act. The deponent also refers to the dated 06.06.2024 passed by the Deputy Commissioner (TDR) who has again rested his oars on the Government dated 24.05.2024 namely determining the value of the land as per the value determined under the BPAT Act for the entire land of 436 acres. Pursuant to the said s the TDR is said to have been forwarded to the complainant/claimant. On this ground contemnors are seeking from being absolved of the present proceedings or in other words seeking for contempt proceedings being dropped and clearly admitting there has been delay for which an unconditional apology has been tendered. 20.2 The affidavit of compliance filed by respondent No.3 is as vague, vagueness could be. Except enclosing the No. UDD 22 MNY 2023, Bengaluru dated 15.03.2024 whereby it has been resolved to utilise 15 acres 39 guntas of the Bengaluru Palace for road widening subject to the grant of TDR and undertaking that BPAT would implement the s nothing further revolves around this affidavit.
