Likewise a sentencing decision taken without following the requirements of subsection (2) of Section 235 of the Code in letter and spirit would also meet a similar fate and may have to be replaced by an appropriate . H SUNDAR @ SUNDARRAJAN v. STATE BY INSPECTOR OF 1055 POLICE [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] The sentencing court must approach the question seriously and A must endeavour to see that all the relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question of sentence are brought on record. Only after giving due weight to the mitigating as well as the aggravating circumstances placed before it, it must pronounce the sentence.

While it took note of the conflict on what amounted to ‘sufficient time’ at the trial court stage to allow for a separate and effective sentencing hearing, it noted that all the decisions also had the following common ground: 27. The common thread that runs through all these decisions is G the express acknowledgment that meaningful, real and 22 1989 (3) SCC 33 23 1991 (4) SCC 341 24 2020 (14) SCC 290 25 1977 (3) SCC 68 26 1977 (3) SCC 218 27 2001 (5) SCC 714 H 1056 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A effective hearing must be afforded to the accused, with the opportunity to adduce material relevant for the question of sentencing. 70. In the present case, the of the Trial Court dealing with sentencing indicates that a meaningful, real and effective hearing B was not afforded to the petitioner. 71. The Trial Court did not conduct any separate hearing on sentencing and did not take into account any mitigating circumstances pertaining to the petitioner before awarding the death penalty.
