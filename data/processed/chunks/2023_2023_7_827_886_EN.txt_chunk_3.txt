Be it differential pricing D or a decision to limit or restrict production, if it is part of national policy or based on Presidential Directives and the appellant raises such a contention after bonafide following the Directives or policy themselves, it may be a matter, which the CCI would have to consider in deciding whether there is abuse of dominant position. If the appellants answer the description of State in Article 36, E then there is a continuing duty to pay obeisance to the Directive Principles. The Act cannot result in transforming the appellants into mere profit-making engines or require of them to be oblivious to their obligations under the Constitution. But that cannot equally mean that they can act with caprice, or unfairly or treat otherwise F similarly situated persons or things with discrimination. The matter must be considered on its own merits both in the appeal as in all the transferred cases. In judicial review the appellants would be held to the standard of fairness as also the duty not to discriminate. The appellants cannot resist the imposition of standards of fairness and the duty to avoid discriminatory practices G when a specialized forum has been created by Parliament under the Act where also apart from the CCI being an expert body, it can seek and receive valuable inputs from experts and what is more, the matter is preceded by the report of Director General of Investigation. [Para 120][884-A-E] H 832 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A 7. Section 54 of the Act gives power to the Central Government to exempt from the application of the Act or any provision and for any period, which is specified in the Notification. The ground for exemption can be security of the State or even public interest. It is not as if the appellants, if there was a genuine case made out for being taken outside the purview of the Act in B public interest, the Government would be powerless. [Para 124][886-C-D] 8. There is no merit in the contention of the appellants that the Act will not apply to the appellants for the reason that the appellants are governed by the Nationalisation Act and that C Nationalisation Act cannot be reconciled with the Act. This is subject to the appellants having all the rights to defend their actions under the law. [Para 125][886-D-E] Tara Prasad Singh and Others v.
