53. With the introduction of Section 12A in the IBC, the CIRP Regulations were also amended to include Regulation 30A which delineated the detailed procedure to withdraw an application under Section 12A.42 At the time of its introduction, the regulation read as follows: “30-A. Withdrawal of application.— (1) An application for withdrawal under Section 12-A shall be submitted to the interim resolution professional or the resolution professional, as the case may be, in Form FA of the Schedule before issue of invitation for expression of interest under Regulation 36-A. (2) The application in sub-regulation (1) shall be accompanied by a bank guarantee towards estimated cost incurred for purposes of clauses (c) and (d) of Regulation 31 till the date of application. 42 IBBI (CIRP) (Third Amendment) Regulations, 2018 vide Notification No. IBBI/2018-19/GN/REG031, dated 3rd July, 2018, w.e.f. 04.07.2018. 1836 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (3) The committee shall consider the application made under sub-regulation (1) within seven days of its constitution or seven days of receipt of the application, whichever is later. (4) Where the application is approved by the committee with ninety per cent voting share, the resolution professional shall submit the application under sub-regulation (1) to the adjudicating authority on behalf of the applicant, within three days of such approval. (5) The adjudicating authority may, by , approve the application submitted under sub-regulation (4).” 54. Regulation 30A(1), as it stood originally, required that an application for withdrawal shall be submitted to the IRP or the RP in the prescribed form, before the invitation for expression of interest under Regulation 30A. It did not provide the procedure for withdrawal after the invitation of expression of interest had been issued. Regulation 30A(2) provided that the application for withdrawal shall be accompanied by a bank guarantee towards the specified estimated costs. Regulation 30A(3) mandated that the CoC must consider the application within seven days of its constitution or the receipt of the application, whichever is later. Finally, Regulation 30A(4) provided that once the CoC approved the application with ninety percent voting share, the RP shall submit the application to the NCLT on behalf of the applicant, within three days of the approval. Finally, under Regulation 30A(5), the NCLT could approve the application submitted by an . 55. Notably, akin to Section 12A, Regulation 30A in its original form, was silent about withdrawal in cases where the application had been admitted, but the CoC had not been formed. Similarly, Regulation 30A(1) only spoke of withdrawal before the invitation of expression of interest had been issued and there was no provision which provided for withdrawal after it had been issued. Both these gaps were identified in subsequent judgements of this Court. 56.
