Thus, what emerges is F that marriage of a Sikkimese woman is made the basis of classification. Thus, in other words, there is discrimination in the following ways: i) between Sikkimese women who as opposed to Sikkimese men. G ii) between Sikkimese women who are married as opposed to those who are not married, and iii) between Sikkimese women who are married to a Sikkimese as opposed to those who are married to a non-Sikkimese, and H ASSOCIATION OF OLD SETTLERS OF SIKKIM AND ORS. v. 339 UNION OF INDIA AND ANR. [B. V. NAGARATHNA, J.] iv) between Sikkimese women who have married a non- A Sikkimese on or after 1st April, 2008, who are not entitled to the benefit of the provision as opposed to those Sikkimese women who are married to a non-Sikkimese prior to the aforesaid date, who are entitled to the said provision. 48. It is further observed that Section 10 (26AAA) was inserted B to the I.T. Act, 1961 by the Finance Act, 2008 w.e.f. 1st April, 1990. The proviso although inserted in the year 2008 has a retrospective effect from 1st April, 1990 i.e., the date on which I.T. Act, 1961 was introduced in Sikkim. Prior to 1990, SITM, 1948, was applicable to Sikkim. This would imply that there was no such discrimination between 1st April, C 1990 and 1st April, 2008 for a period of eighteen years. Thus, those Sikkimese women who had the benefit of the exemption have been deprived by the same w.e.f., 1st April, 2008. The retrospectivity of the proviso takes away a vested benefit extended to such category of women covered under the proviso w.e.f., 1st April, 1990 without there being a rationale for the same. D 49. Further, it is necessary to analyse the basis of classification in terms of the categories of persons enunciated under Regulation (3) of the 1961 Regulation as under: (i) If a woman is the wife of a person who has his domicile in E the territory of Sikkim immediately before the commencement of the 1961 Regulation, such a person shall be a Sikkim Subject if he: a) was born in the territory of Sikkim and is resident therein, or F b) has been ordinarily resident in the territory of Sikkim for a period of not less than fifteen years immediately preceding the commencement of the Regulation. (ii) The wife of the person having domiciled in Sikkim shall be deemed to have domiciled in Sikkim for the purpose of G Regulation (3) [vide clause (2) of Explanation to Regulation (3)]. (iii) Under Regulation (6), a woman of a foreign nationality who is married to a Sikkim Subject after the commencement of 1961 Regulation shall ordinarily be eligible to be registered H 340 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R.
