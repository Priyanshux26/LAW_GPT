1061 Bharti Arora v. The State of Haryana anything in good faith done or intended to be done under this Act or any rule or made thereunder.” 28. It could thus be seen that Section 69 of the NDPS Act provides immunity to the Central Government, State Government or any officer of the Central or State Government or any other person exercising any powers or discharging any functions or performing any duties under this Act or any rule or made thereunder from civil or criminal proceedings. 29. This Court, in the case of General Officer Commanding, Rashtriya Rifles v. Central Bureau of Investigation and Another,9 after considering various earlier pronouncements, observed thus: “69. A public servant is under a moral and legal obligation to perform his duty with truth, honesty, honour, loyalty and faith, etc. He is to perform his duty according to the expectation of the office and the nature of the post for the reason that he is to have a respectful obedience to the law and authority in to accomplish the duty assigned to him. 70. Good faith has been defined in Section 3(22) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 to mean a thing which is, in fact, done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not. Anything done with due care and attention, which is not mala fide, is presumed to have been done in good faith. There should not be personal ill will or malice, no intention to malign and scandalise. Good faith and public good are though the question of fact, are required to be proved by adducing evidence. (Vide Madhavrao Narayanrao Patwardhan v.

[(1981) 1 SCC 597 : AIR 1981 SC 636] this Court while dealing with the issue held : (SCC p. 602, para 18) “18. … The expression has several shades of meaning. In the popular sense, the phrase ‘in good faith’ simply means ‘honestly, without fraud, collusion, or deceit; really, actually, without pretence and without intent to assist or act in furtherance of a fraudulent or otherwise unlawful scheme’. (See Words and Phrases, Permanent Edn., Vol. 18-A, p. 91.) Although the meaning of ‘good faith’ may vary in the context of different statutes, subjects and situations, honest intent free from taint of fraud or fraudulent design, is a constant element of its connotation. Even so, the quality and quantity of the honesty requisite for constituting ‘good faith’ is conditioned by the context and object of the statute in which this term is employed.
