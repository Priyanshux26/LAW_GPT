It is still a part of the Constitution as amended. The reference in this regard is made to the seventh constitutional amendment which conferred power upon the President to frame regulations for administering Part D States. After the said Amendment, 13 2022 (9) SCR300 THE STATE OF TELANGANA & ORS. v. M/S TIRUMALA 165 CONSTRUCTIONS [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] the Regulations were continued for a limited period. The constitutional amendment completely became part of the Constitution. This Court in the matter of A.K. Roy (supra) has considered the issue. 31. It was urged, on behalf of the Maharashtra state that the amendment to Section 26 of Maharashtra Value Added Tax Act, 2002 (hereafter as “MVAT Act”) requiring a pre-deposit is not inconsistent with the Amendment. It is procedural in nature and no vested right of the assessee was taken away. It is also not in dispute that the same is in respect of past levies prior to the introduction of GST w.e.f. 1st July, 2017 and therefore, even otherwise are saved by Section 174 of the Maharashtra GST Act. 32. It is submitted that the plain language of Section 26(6A) and 26(6B) of the MVAT Act clarifi es that it applies in all cases where the is passed after 15th April, 2017 and an appeal is preferred. That provision only requires a pre-deposit of 10% and takes away the discretion of the Appellate Authority/Tribunal. It does not take away the statutory right of appeal and only regulates the same by removing the discretion of the Tribunal. The condition of pre-deposit is also not even an onerous condition to make it arbitrary. The only question, therefore, is whether there is any vested right of fi ling an appeal without a pre-deposit. The plain language of the amendment has taken away the discretion of the Appellate Authority and not the right of appeal in case where the is passed by the original authority after 15th April, 2017. The state relies on the decisions, to say that the right to appeal remains unaltered, only its conditions are controlled, or regulated, with pre-deposit requirements, at the appellate stage, i.e. Anant Mills Company Limited v. State of Maharashtra14; Vijay Prakash D. Mehta v. Collector of Customs (Preventive), Bombay15 State of Haryana v. Maruti Udyog Limited &Ors16Thirumali Chemicals Limited v. Union of India17; Neena Aneja & Anr. v. Jai Prakash Associated Limited18. 33. The State of Gujarat urges that the High Court fell into error in not recognizing that in somewhat similar situations, this court in A. Hajee 14 (1975) 3 SCR220 15 (1988) Supp (2) SCR 434 16 (2000) Supp 3 SCR 185 17 (2011) 4 SCR739 18 (2021) 15 SCR96 166 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Abdul Shakoor& Co v. State of Madras19 (hereafter, “Hajee Abdul Shukoor”) recognized the power of states to even retrospectively validate assessments under the Act of 1939 even though the earlier Act had failed for want of Presidential assent. It was also pointed out that this court in M/s West Ramnad Electric Distribution Co. Ltd. v. State of Madras20 validated the power of states to retrospectively validate actions taken under notifi cations of enactments which had been declared unconstitutional and non-est.
