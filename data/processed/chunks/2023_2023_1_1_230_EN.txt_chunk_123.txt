The Ordinance demonetised currency notes of Rs.500/-, Rs.1,000/- and Rs.10,000/- which were in circulation, primarily to check the unaccounted hoarding of money, with a directive that they could be exchanged for re-issued bank notes, within F ten days. The period of exchange was extended a number of times by both, the Bank and the Central Government. By the end of 1947, out of a total of Rs.143.97 crores of high denomination notes, notes of the value of Rs.134.9 crores had been exchanged. Thus, notes worth Rs.9.07 crores went out of circulation or not exchanged. G It is said that this exercise turned out to be more like a currency conversion drive as the government couldn’t achieve much profit in the cash-strapped economy at that time. H 170 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A k) The second demonetisation was carried out in the year 1978, in pursuance of the recommendation of the Wanchoo Committee, appointed by the Central Government, to recall the re-introduced Rs.1,000/-, Rs.5,000/- and Rs.10,000/- notes, entirely from the cash system. The stated objective of such measure was to nullify black money supposedly B held in high denomination currency notes. The government resorted to demonetisation of bank notes of denominations Rs.1,000/-, Rs.5,000/-, and Rs.10,000/- notes on 16th January, 1978, under the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance, 1978 (No. 1 of 1978) and C people were allowed three days’ time to exchange their notes. During this demonetisation exercise, out of a value of Rs.146 Crores demonetised notes, currency notes of value of Rs.124.45 Crores were exchanged and a sum of Rs.21.55 Crores, or 14.76% of the demonetised currency notes, were extinguished. D 11. It would be useful at this stage to discuss briefly the Acts of 1946 and 1978 and the impugned demonetisation having regard to sub- section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. 11.1 The Ordinance of 12th January, 1946 stated that on the expiry E of the 12th Day of January, 1946, all high denomination bank notes shall, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 26 of the Act, cease to be legal tender in payment or on account at any place in British India. A provision was made for the exchange of the high denomination bank notes which had ceased to be legal tender, with bank notes of the F denominational value of Rs.100/- which continued to be legal tender. 11.2 The High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978 was enacted in public interest and provided demonetisation of certain high denomination bank notes and G for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The said Act,inter-alia, defined a high denomination bank note to be a bank note of the denominational value of Rs.1,000/ -, Rs.5,000/- or Rs.10,000/-, issued by the Reserve Bank of India immediately before the commencement of the said Act. The said Act also stated in Section 3 that on the expiry H VIVEK NARAYAN SHARMA v. UNION OF INDIA 171 [B. V. NAGARATHNA, J.] of the 16th Day of January, 1978, all high denomination bank A notes shall, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 26 of the Act, cease to be legal tender.
