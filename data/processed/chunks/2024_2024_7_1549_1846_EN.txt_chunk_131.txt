In Government of A P v. Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd.,338 it was held that the State legislature can tax buildings as a unit under Entry 49 of List II, but not the machinery and furniture contained 334 [1963] 1 SCR 220 335 [1975] 3 SCR 220 : (1975) 2 SCC 175 336 [1965] 3 SCR 47 337 Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee (supra) [4]; See Jalkal Vibhag Nagar Nigam v. Pradeshiya Industrial & Investment Corp (2021) 20 SCC 657 [46] 338 [1975] Supp. 1 SCR 394 : (1975) 2 SCC 274 [17] 1716 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in the building. In Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation v. GTL Infrastructure Ltd.,339 this Court held that the word “buildings” has to be interpreted dynamically to extend to all ancillary and subsidiary matters. Consequently, it was held that the State legislature has the legislative power to tax mobile towers under Entry 49 of List II. The principle which emanates from the above decisions is that a tax levied on the activity or service rendered on or in connection with lands and buildings does not fall within the description of taxes on lands and buildings under Entry 49 of List II. However, the legislature may take into account the use of land or buildings for determining the incidence or measure of tax levied under Entry 49 of List II. 272. Further, it is now well-established that a levy of tax on lands and buildings is not concerned with the division of interest or ownership in the units of lands and buildings.340 In Sudhir Chandra Nawn v. WTO,341 a Constitution Bench which dealt with the constitutional validity of Wealth Tax Act 1957, explained the scope of Entry 49 of List II by observing that the tax on lands and buildings is directly imposed on lands and buildings or both as units, and bears a definite relation to it. The decision holds that the State legislature may adopt the annual or capital value of lands and buildings for determining the incidence of tax levied under Entry 49 of List II. 273. In Second Gift Tax Officer, Mangalore v. D H Nazareth,342 this Court dealt with whether Parliament was competent to enact the Gift Tax Act under its residuary powers. In that case, the owner of a coffee plantation had made a gift of coffee plantations by a registered gift deed to his sons. The government demanded gift tax on the transfer of land title. It was contended that taxes on lands and buildings under Entry 49 of List II also cover taxes in respect of gift on lands and buildings. It was further submitted that since the legislative power of taxing gift of land is traceable to Entry 49 of List II, Parliament could not have taken recourse to its residuary powers. Chief Justice M Hidayatullah, speaking for the Constitution Bench, held that the impugned levy was not a tax directly imposed upon 339 [2016] 11 SCR 172 : (2017) 3 SCC 545 [29] 340 Assistant Commissioner of Urban Land Tax v.
