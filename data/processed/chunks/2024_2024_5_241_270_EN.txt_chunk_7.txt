11 [2009] 5 SCR 1159 : (2009) 7 SCC 234 12 Impugned , p. 19 13 ibid, p. 20 14 ibid. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 251 Life Insurance Corporation of India v. The State of Rajasthan and Ors. He has argued that since insurance falls under the Union list and more specifically, since only the Union can prescribe the rate of stamp duty on insurance policies, the state government cannot demand that the stamp duty on insurance policies must necessarily be paid to it and that the stamps cannot be purchased from other states. He relied on VVS Rama Sharma (supra) on the point that a state cannot require that insurance stamps, which are property of the central government, must be purchased only from that particular state when the insurance policy is issued within its territory. Challenging the imposition of stamp duty by the state government, the learned ASG has further submitted that a levy of stamp duty is in the nature of tax and that there is no valid imposition of tax unless there is a rate of taxation. Relying on Govind Saran Ganga Saran v. Commissioner of Sales Tax15 and Mathuram Agrawal v. State of Madhya Pradesh16, he has submitted that the rate of stamp duty must be clearly and unambiguously ascertainable, without which there is no valid tax law. Since the state does not have the domain competence to prescribe the rate of stamp duty in the present case, it cannot validly impose and demand the payment of such duty. Lastly, the learned ASG has argued that Entry 44 of List III is not in the nature of a taxation entry by relying on State of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries17 and State of Karnataka v. State of Meghalaya18. He submits that it is well-settled in taxation law that entries pertaining to taxation are clearly demarcated between the Union List and the State List. There is no head of taxation in the Concurrent List. Hence, the state government cannot impose stamp duty on the appellant by claiming legislative competence under Entry 44 of List III. 5.2 Apart from arguing that levy of stamp duty by the state is contrary to the constitutional scheme, the learned ASG has also argued that stamp duty cannot be imposed in the present case under the specific state enactments. He has argued that the 1998 Act applies in the present case as the notice for 15 [1985] 3 SCR 985 : 1985 Supp SCC 205, para 6 16 [1999] Supp. 4 SCR.195 : (1999) 8 SCC 667, para 12 17 [2004] 1 SCR 564 : (2004) 10 SCC 201 18 [2022] 18 SCR 516 : (2023) 4 SCC 416, para 92 252 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports recovery has been issued under Section 37(5) of the 1998 Act. Section 3 of the 1998 Act is the charging provision that provides that instruments shall be chargeable with duty of the amount indicated in the Schedule. By comparing entry 47 of Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 (which provides the rates of stamp duty for various kinds of policies of insurance) and the Schedule under the 1998 Act, he has argued that there is no parallel entry in the Schedule of the 1998 Act that provides the rate of stamp duty on insurance policies.
