The dispute in this case arose as regards value of Esbiothrin. During the period between 19.04.2000 - 23.05.2001, BIL sold the goods to Aventis CropScience (India) Ltd., who sold the same to end customers. For this period, the revenue proposed to treat the price at which Aventis Crop B Science (India) Ltd. sold the product to the end customers as the assessable value ignoring the transaction cost. The duty demand was ` 1,68,81,685/- for that period. An amount of ` 2,39,54,913/- was demanded on the ground that AgrEvo SA/ Aventis CropScience SA had recovered a sum of ` 14,97,18,205/- through its 100% owned subsidiary C Aventis CropScience (India) Ltd. towards expenses incurred for advertising, publicity, marketing and selling expenses, storage, outward handling, servicing, warranty, etc., in terms of the agreement entered into with Sumitomo on the ground that since AgrEvo SA/ Aventis CropScience SA was the holding company of BIL, the amount paid by Sumitomo to AgrEvo SA/ Aventis CropScience SA should be treated as D additional consideration and added to the value of the goods manufactured and cleared to BIL. An amount of ` 5,95,97,434/- was demanded as differential duty on Esbiuothrin during the period 09.06.2001 to 25.03.2004, on the ground that the price at which the goods were sold to end customers by Sumitomo should be the basis for determination of E assessable value and that the sale by BIL to Aventis CropScience (India) Ltd. was to a “related” person. The in original was appealed by BIL, to the CESTAT. 7. By the impugned , the CESTAT noted that BIL had developed a process of manufacture of Esbiothrin which did not reach F the final stage. Before that, AgrEvo SA, the foreign company became aware that a competitor was emerging, and it entered into a JVA. The result was that BIL stopped development of the process. It obtained know-how of the complete manufacturing process as well as the right to manufacture the product and then, sold the whole product to a subsidiary of AgrEvo SA. In return, BIL received technical know-how free of cost G as well as an existing marketing set up developed by a subsidiary company of AgrEvo SA, at no cost. BIL was also assured of sale of the product and a level of profit for the manufacturing activities undertaken by it. It was free to develop other products. The shareholders of the private company, Bilakhias family members also got a lumpsum non- H compete fee. In return, AgrEvo SA and the Indian subsidiary ensured M/S BILAG INDUSTRIES P. LTD. v. COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. 623 DAMAN [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] that there were no competitors. The market established by them was A intact. Furthermore, the product price at which they sold, needed no revision. The marketing set up and the consumers identified by them would remain intact in the absence of any competitor. According to the CESTAT, these transactions between the foreign company (AgrEvo SA, later known as Aventis CropScience SA) and two Indian subsidiaries B was a combined operation by which both benefited.
