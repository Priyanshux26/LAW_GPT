What are the legal implications of a promotional trailer, popularly known as a ‘promo’, or a teaser that is circulated before the release of a movie? Does it create any contractual relationship or obligations akin to it? Is it an unfair trade practice if the contents of the promotional trailer are not shown in the movie? These questions have arisen in the context of a consumer dispute wherein the consumer courts have allowed the complaint alleging deficiency of service based on a ‘contractual obligation’ and ‘unfair trade practice’. For the reasons to follow, we have held that promotional trailers are unilateral and do not qualify as offers eliciting acceptance, and as such they do not transform into promises, much less agreements enforceable by law. We have also held that the facts do not indicate adoption of 146 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports an unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Before we delve into the analysis to draw our conclusions, the short facts necessary for the case are as follows. 2. The appellant is a known film producer. It produced a film called ‘Fan’ in the year 2016. Before the release of the film, the appellant circulated a promotional trailer, both on television and online, which contained a song in the form of a video.
