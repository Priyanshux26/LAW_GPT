The sentence imposed by the Sessions Court was confirmed by the High Court without any modification. 5. Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that at the time of conviction, the minimum sentence prescribed u/Sec. 4 of the POCSO Act was seven years and as on date, the Appellant has already served more than seven years of his sentence. It is also submitted 154 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports that the Appellant is providing for the day-to-day expenses of the victim and her child and therefore, further imprisonment will impact not only his family but also the victim’s. On these grounds, Learned Counsel presses for leniency. 6. Having heard the Learned Counsel for the parties and considering the totality of the circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the ends of justice would be met if the period of imprisonment awarded against the Appellant is reduced to the period already undergone by him. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part. The conviction of the Appellant u/s. u/S. 3(a) r/w Sec. 4 of the POCSO Act, 2012 is hereby confirmed. However, the sentence imposed by the Sessions Court and confirmed by the High Court is hereby modified and reduced to the period already undergone by the Appellant. 7. The Appellant be set at liberty forthwith in case he is not required in any other case. 8. With the aforesaid, the appeal stands disposed of. Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeal partly allowed.
