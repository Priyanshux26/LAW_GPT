[Para 35] Test Identifi cation Parade – Whether TIP violates the fundamental right of an accused under Article 20(3) of the Constitution. Held: What is prohibited by Article 20(3) of the Constitution is procuring by compulsion of the positive volitional evidentiary acts of an accused – It is true that an accused may be said to be compelled to attend a test identifi cation parade, but this compulsion does not involve any positive volitional evidentiary act – His mere attendance or the exhibition of his body at a test identifi cation parade even though compelled, does not result in any evidentiary act until he is identifi ed by some other agency – The identifi cation of him by a witness is not his act, even though his body is exhibited for the purpose – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in getting from an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positive volitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined under Article 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, if that evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiary act on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will have no application. [Paras 26 and 35] 888 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. Test Identifi cation Parade – The test identifi cation parade provides corroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court: Held: It is well settled that the substantive evidence is the evidence of identification in court and the test identification parade provides corroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court, if required – However, what weight must be attached to the evidence of identifi cation in court, which is not preceded by a test identifi cation parade, is a matter for the courts of fact to examine. [Para 48] Test Identifi cation Parade – Where an accused himself refused to participate in the TIP: Held: In a case where an accused himself refused to participate in the TIP, it is not open to him to contend that the statement of the eye witnesses made for the fi rst time in Court, wherein they specifi cally point towards him as a person who had taken part in the commission of the crime, should not be relied upon – Such a plea is available provided the prosecution is itself responsible for not holding a TIP – However, in a case where the accused himself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but to proceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimony of the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trial of the case. [Para 70] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.54A – Test Identifi cation Parade – Obligation u/s. 54A CrPC: Held: The introduction of Section 54A in the CrPC, an accused is under an obligation to stand for identifi cation parade – An accused cannot resist subjecting himself to the TIP on the ground that he cannot be forced or coerced for the same – If the coercion is sought to be imposed in getting from an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positive volitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined under Article 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him – However, if that evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiary act on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will have no application – The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does not produce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act.
