CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES 4. Ms. Liz Mathew, learned senior counsel for the appellants, in assailing the impugned , advanced the following submissions: A. The Division Bench erred in interpreting section 174 of the 2003 Act to extend the applicability of such Act and its limitation clause to the existing proceedings. B. The Division Bench erred in applying section 174 of the 2003 Act to the present case since this was not a case of inconsistency with any other law, rather, it concerned the liabilities incurred under the 1910 Act in view of section 185(5) of the 2003 Act. 350 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports C. K.C. Ninan v. Kerala SEB18 was relied on to argue that section 56(2) of the 2003 Act would not apply to a liability which was incurred prior to the enforcement of the 2003 Act. D. The High Court erred in not appreciating the purport of section 185 of the 2003 Act which saved the application of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897.19 5. Mr. Jayant Mehta, learned senior counsel for the first respondent, while supporting the impugned submitted as under: A. The first and the second show cause notices were not ‘demands’ but merely notices for the purposes of quantification and raising of demand in the future. B. There was nothing which prevented the appellants from raising a demand during the pendency of the first writ petition since the High Court had not passed any of stay. C. Assuming that the 2003 Act had no application to dues arising during a period of time prior to its enforcement w.e.f. 10th June, 2003 and even though section 24 of the Indian Electricity Act, 191020 did not prescribe a period of limitation, the process of recovery of dues, if any, had to be initiated within the period for institution of a suit, i.e., three (3) years from the date of the appellant’s awareness of the sum due, and, at any rate, must be initiated within a reasonable period, which cannot be nine (9) years. D. Allowing the appellants to raise a demand nine (9) years later would lead to injustice and arbitrariness, more so when in the absence of any demand the question of the first respondent neglecting to pay charges did not arise. E. Encashment of bank guarantee by the appellants immediately after the revised demand was raised on the first respondent without giving any opportunity to the first respondent to pursue legal remedies, in the circumstances, must be held to be arbitrary. 18 [2023] 9 SCR 637 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 663 19 1897 Act, hereafter 20 1910 Act, hereafter [2024] 11 S.C.R. 351 The Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitran Company Limited & Ors. v. Bapuna Alcobrew Private Limited & Anr. ISSUES 6. Not too many issues arise for decision on the facts of the present appeal. The task before us is limited to determining whether section 56(2) of the 2003 Act has any application to a demand raised by the appellants on the first respondent for recovery of sums payable under the 1910 Act and, hence, the impugned is sustainable on this score; if not, whether the demand, if it be treated as one under the 1910 Act, is sustainable having regard to the long delay.
