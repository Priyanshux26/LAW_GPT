243, with the stipulation that the restrictions outlined in GoM No. 243 would apply to land allotted by the Cooperative Society to its members. The High Court held that the Government would be well advised to impose additional restrictions against allotments to individuals who owned a house in their name or that of their spouse or children, and this recommendation should apply to the allotments made to Respondent No. 4 therein. The directive of the High Court did not preclude the Government from making allotments in accordance with the policy under GoM No. 243. It was also open for the identified category of individuals to form a new society and submit the necessary registration applications. 15. Following this , the State of Andhra Pradesh issued six GoMs (Nos. 419 to 425), all dated 25.03.2008, although GoM No. 421 was later rescinded. GoM No. 419 states that, based on representations from the four wings—Legislature, Judiciary, Executive, and Media—land allotments for housing sites had been made under GoM No. 522, albeit the same was subsequently struck down by the High Court on 08.10.2007. The Court had directed the Government that it would be well advised to incorporate additional restrictions for those who owned a house or housing site in their name or that of their spouse or children. 16. In issuing GoM No. 1424, which allocated land for Respondent No. 4 therein, the Government confirmed that all restrictions in GoM No. 243 would apply to those allotments. The Government decided to accept and implement the of the High Court and to allot housing sites to members and societies according to GoM Nos. 242, 243, and 244. Consequently, 3.25 acres of government land in Puppalaguda Village, Rajendranagar Mandal, Ranga Reddy District, was earmarked for allotment to Uday Civil Services Cooperative Mutually Aided House Building Society, specifically for AIS officers with Andhra Pradesh nativity and those who had worked or were working in the State for at least three years. 17. The allotment was to be done at the basic value of land per acre as on 04.05.2006, for housing purposes. Conditions specified in GoM No. 419 included adherence to the policies outlined in GoM Nos. 242, 243, and 244. Members who had received any prior allotment [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1387 State of Andhra Pradesh and Others v. Dr. Rao, V.B.J. Chelikani and Others at a concessional rate, either directly or through a society, would not be eligible. Members in service as on 29.04.2006, would qualify, and in cases where both spouses were employed, only one would be eligible. Development of the land would be carried out by the Cooperative Society or a designated agency, adhering to applicable zoning regulations. Each member was eligible for a plot of 500 square yards, and no allottee could transfer or dispose of the land via GPA for a period of ten years from the date of allotment. Allotments were to be made within six months of the alienation date. A member who was allotted a housing site was to complete the construction of the house within a period of two years.
