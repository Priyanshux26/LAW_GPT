[Para 35] MUKESH SINGH v. THE STATE (NCT OF DELHI) 889 Test Identifi cation Parade – Importance and Evidentiary value of TIP: Held: Facts which establish the identity of any person or thing whose identity is relevant are, by virtue of Section 9 of the Evidence Act, always relevant – The term ‘identifi cation’ means proving that a person, subject or article before the Court is the very same that he or it is alleged, charged or reputed to be – Identifi cation is almost always a matter of opinion or belief. [Para 37] Test Identifi cation Parade – Object of: Held: Before the investigating authorities send up a case to Court, they must be satisfi ed that the persons arrested by them are the persons accused of having committed the crime – If they were known to the witnesses, the witnesses would have given their names and that would have established their identity, but when they were not known, their identity could be established only if the witnesses on seeing them say that they are the off enders – Since it would be very easy for a witness who has little regard for truth, to say that the person arrested on suspicion was the off ender, he is confronted with the suspect mixed with innocent men – If he picks him out, that would add to the credibility of his statement that he was the off ender – This is the primary object of identifi cation proceeding.
