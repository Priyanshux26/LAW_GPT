67. [Paras 51, 52] Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 – s.41(2) – Power of search and seizure – Limited by the recognition of fundamental rights by the Constitution and statutory limitations: Held: s.41(2) begins from the power of search and seizure conferred by the State upon its executive or administrative arms – Such power is inherently limited by the recognition of fundamental rights by the Constitution as well as statutory limitations – At the same time, it is not legitimate to assume that Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India would be affected by the provisions of search and seizure – The statutory provisions conferring authorities with the power to search and seize are a mere temporary interference with the right of the accused as they stand well regulated by reasonable restrictions emanating from the statutory provisions itself – Such a power cannot be considered as a violation of any fundamental rights of the person concerned. [Para 41] Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 – Constitution of India – Article 21 – Just and fair trial, a fundamental right – Actions of authorities within the NDPS Act must ensure upholding the rights of the accused to have a fair trial: Held: Article 21 necessitates a just and fair trial to be a humane and fundamental right and actions of the prosecution as well as the authorities concerned within the meaning of the NDPS Act 1985 must be towards ensuring of upholding of the rights of the accused in to allow to have a fair trial – The harmonious 446 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports balance between the Latin maxims salus populi suprema lex (the safety of the people is the supreme law) and salus republicae suprema lex (safety of the State is the supreme law) is not only crucial and pertinent but lies at the core of the doctrine that welfare of an individual must yield to that of the community subject to the State being right, just, and fair.
