The respondents submitted various representations in respect of the proposed 1008 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports acquisition proceedings vide letters dated 30.10.1976, 01.11.1976, 30.12.1976, 17.01.1977, 07.02.1977, 24.02.1977 and 10.03.1977. However, the respondents never apprised the OSD that there was a litigation pending between them and the state government regarding the nature and ownership of one parcel of the Nangli Kota lands bearing Survey no. 229. This, according to Ms. Dave, was a willful concealment of facts on part of the respondents. d) On 28.04.1977, the OSD sent a letter to the State Government recommending for the issuance of a notification under Section 52(1) of the RUI Act for acquisition of the Nangli Kota lands. e) The State Government, on 16.06.1977 issued a notification under Section 52(1) which was published in the official gazette on 23.06.1977. The learned counsel has submitted that since the said notice showed the names of all the seven sons of late Ram Narain, the notification under Section 52(1) was valid as per the provisions of the RUI Act. f) The learned counsel relied on this Court’s in Pratap v. State of Rajasthan, reported in (1996) 3 SCC 1 to submit that after the issuance of the notification under Section 52(1), the land vested completely in the State Government free from all encumbrances, as per sub-sections (1) and (4) of Section 52. g) Further, the respondents were aware of the proposed acquisition proceedings and appeared before the OSD who heard them at every stage of the proceedings. This is substantiated by the fact that the respondents sought time on multiple occasions to produce proof of their ownership of the Nangli Kota lands. The respondents also had the benefit of legal expertise and guidance all throughout the acquisition proceedings which is evident from the power of attorney or vakalatnama placed on record on behalf of the respondents. Therefore, it could not be said that the respondents being laymen had no proper knowledge of the legal implications involved in the acquisition process. h) The learned counsel relied on this Court’s in Special Deputy Collector, Land Acquisition CMDA v. J. Sivaprakasam and Ors., reported in (2011) 1 SCC 330 to submit that there was no requirement on the part of the acquiring authority to [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1009 Urban Improvement Trust v. Smt. Vidhya Devi and Ors. prove actual service of notice of proposal to acquire land, on the person whose land is sought to be acquired. The purpose of notice is to make the owner(s) or interested parties aware about the proposed acquisition and therefore, such knowledge can also be inferred by way of implied or constructive notice. i) The notification issued under Section 52(1) of the RUI Act contained names of all the seven sons of late Ram Narain and the same was issued after the respondents had appeared before the OSD. Therefore, the purpose of issuing the notice under Section 52(2) notice was achieved when all the interested parties appeared before the OSD and no individual service of notice or pasting of the notice at a conspicuous place of the locality was required.
