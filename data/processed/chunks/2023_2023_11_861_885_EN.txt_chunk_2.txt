– A case carrying accusation of a pre-arranged plan based on common intention to kidnap/abduct for committing murder was turned into a case of commission of murder based on motive occurred at the spur of the moment upon the alleged sight of the appellants’ sister with deceased in a compromising position – Prosecution had not cared to establish the charge framed against the appellants u/s.364/34 and despite that it went on to put forth another case. [Paras 15, 16 and 18] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.60 – Applicability of – Evidence of PW-10, if admissible: Held: s.60 postulates that oral evidence must be direct in all cases– However, it is inadmissible only when it proposes to establish the truth of the statement but not the factum of the statement by other persons – There is a fi ne distinction between proving the factum of a statement by other persons and proving the truth of such statement – In the present case, PW-10 had only spoken about the factum of deceased’s divulgation that he is in love with ‘P’ and also about her promise to meet him in the evening of 25.06.1999 at the fodder room near Katvawala passage – That apart, the fact is that though he had deposed that he had seen the appellants at about 08.30 pm he did not depose, even vaguely, that he had seen either deceased and ‘P’ together at any time proximate to the occurrence – Thus, applying s.60, even if it is taken that evidence of PW-10 is admissible to the extent that deceased revealed about his love with ‘P’ and her promise to meet deceased in the evening of 25.06.1999 to PW-10, the evidence of PW-10 could not be taken as admissible as relates the truth of the said statement. [Paras 23 and 24] Evidence – Extra judicial confession, allegedly made by the appellants to PW-7 – Admissibility: Held: Extra judicial confession cannot always be taken as a weak piece of evidence and the question whether it is worthy to be taken as admissible and to form basis for conviction in a criminal trial would depend upon veracity of the witness to whom the confession was allegedly made – In the present case, taking into account all the aspects revealed from the records, which were not at all considered by the trial Court and the High Court, evidence of PW-7 on extra judicial confession could not inspire confi dence. [Paras 34 and 40] KRISHAN KUMAR AND ANR. v. THE STATE OF 865 HARYANA Evidence – Recovery of weapon viz., the chunni used for strangulation: Held: The place of recovery was an open place and is accessible to all – Non-examination of the independent witness along with the deposition of PW-6 and PW-14 would make the recovery of chunni and purse inconsequential.
