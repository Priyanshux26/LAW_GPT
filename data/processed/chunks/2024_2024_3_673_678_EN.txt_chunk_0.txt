[2024] 3 S.C.R. 673 : 2024 INSC 227 Dr Sonia Verma & Anr. v. The State of Haryana & Anr. (Criminal Appeal No. 1433 of 2024) 07 March 2024 [Vikram Nath and Satish Chandra Sharma, JJ] Issue for Consideration The issue for consideration was a challenge to a decision of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana, refusing to quash the F.I.R. registered u/s. 506, 420, 34, 120-B and 467 of the Penal Code, 1860, against the Appellants/Accused, on the ground that the dispute between the parties was essentially civil in nature. Headnotes Criminal Law – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 482 – Inherent powers – Scope of exercise of power for quashing the criminal proceedings: Held: The High Court ought to have quashed the criminal proceedings when it was apprised of the fact that the substance of the Criminal Complaint served only a cast of doubt on the validity of a commercial transaction and an appropriate civil remedy was already being pursued. [Para 17] Abuse of Law – Dispute essentially civil in nature, given a cloak of criminality – Circumstances: Held: Circumstances such as the Complainant/ Respondent No. 2 registering the FIR after the filing of the Civil Suit by the Accused/Appellants, the Complainant selectively implicating the Appellants in a Criminal case, the Complainant’s failure to contest the matter before this Hon’ble Court, and the bonafides of the Accused/Appellants in paying the rent before their alleged purchase of the Suit property, can be concluded as an attempt on the part of the Complainant to shroud a civil dispute with a cloak of criminality.
