Supreme Court Reports not to press issues relating to the compliance of the Conditions Precedent and grant of extensions/exclusions along with offering to withdraw the Company Appeal and the Appeals pending before this Court – In view of clear dated 18.01.2024, the PBG of Rs.150 Crore could not have been allowed to be adjusted with the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore – Non-compliance of the SRA with the of this Court has led to a dereliction of its obligations to implement the Resolution Plan – SRA failed to implement the Resolution Plan by not infusing the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore in cash, as required by Clause 6.3.1(g) and the Implementation Schedule under Clause 7.7 of the Resolution Plan.

[Para 129] 1.2 The impugned of the NCLAT nowhere caps the Airport Dues to a maximum of Rs. 25 Crore – Moreover, such a mention of Rs. 25 Crore is plainly absent in its observations regarding Airport Dues – The Resolution Plan, too, does not contemplate the CIRP costs to be strictly subject to a maximum of Rs. 25 Crore – To accept such a contention of the Appellants would be [2024] 11 S.C.R.
