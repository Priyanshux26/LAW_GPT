Headnotes† Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.439 – Bail – The case of the prosecution is that one accused viz. K (President of a Society), in connivance with the co-accused, misappropriated an amount of ₹79,54,26,963/- – Further case of the prosecution that respondent no.1 is a co-conspirator and a close friend of the alleged mastermind K – It was stated in the charge-sheet that respondent no.1 was paid an amount of ₹9,69,28,500/- which was withdrawn from the Society and paid to him as financial assistance – Thereafter, respondent no.1 purchased five immovable properties in name of K – During investigation, respondent no.1 was arrested – However, the High Court released him on bail – Correctness: Held: The Courts while granting bail are required to consider relevant factors such as nature of the accusation, role ascribed to the accused concerned, possibilities/chances of tampering with the evidence and/or witnesses, antecedents, flight risk etc. – The Single Judge of the High Court, in the impugned , has simply proceeded on the premise that there were only allegations made by some persons against the respondent no.1 and he was not a member of the Society which had committed such financial irregularities – The impugned goes on to state that respondent no.1 was not involved in the affairs of the Society nor was he responsible for the irregularities alleged – At the present stage, where the charge-sheet stands filed, it emerges that there is some * Author 754 [2024] 8 S.C.R.
