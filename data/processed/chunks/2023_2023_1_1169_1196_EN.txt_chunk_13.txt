SCR 217; (1994) 6 SCC 157 H 1188 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A dearness allowance to workmen being to neutralise the portion of the increase in the cost of living, it should ordinarily be on a sliding scale and provide for an increase when the cost-of- living increases and a decrease when it falls. The same principle was reiterated in Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v. Workmen [AIR 1969 SC 360] B and Shri Chalthan Vibhag Khand Udyog Sahakari Mandli Ltd. v. G.S. Barot, Member, Industrial Court, Gujarat [(1979) 4 SCC 622] and it was emphasised that normally full neutralisation is not given except to the lowest class of employees and that too on a sliding scale.” C 29. Therefore, the state and public employers have an obligation to address – as a measure of public interest, the ill-effects of rise in the cost of living, on account of price rise, which results in fall in real wages. This obligation should be discharged on a periodic basis. Yet, there cannot be any straitjacket formula as to when such pay revisions are to be made and to what extent revisions should take place. As a general D practice, the Union and state governments have been undertaking such exercises each decade. 30. Returning to the facts of this case, it is evident that the respondents have confined the grant of revised pay scales to employees existing as on 29.03.2010. Whilst the fixation of cut-off date for the grant of benefits cannot be questioned, what is within the domain of the E court, is to examine the impact of such fixation and whether it results in discrimination. In the present case, the Pay Commission’s recommendations for pay revision were with effect from 01.01.1996. However, the State and MSFC decided not to implement it from that date, but with effect from 01.01.2006, i.e., a decade later, because the F benefit given to employees (or arrears) on the rolls of MSFC as on 29.03.2010 were confined or limited to arrears payable from 1 January 2006. At the same time, fitment and fixation of salary was with effect from 1 January 1996, in terms of Para 6 of the MSFC’s circular dated 09.04.2010, which stipulated that revised salary “will be fixed with effect from 01.01.1996 as per the formula of the Fifth G Pay Commission as mentioned below”. The formula was: “Old Basic Pay as on 01.01.1996 Add: applicable DA as on 01.01.1996 Add: Amount of 1st Interim Relief, i.e., Rs.100/- only. Add: Amount of 2nd Interim Relief, i.e., 10% of old Basic Pay (subject to minimum Rs.100/ -). Add: 40% of old Basic Pay as on 01.01.1996 as loading =Total (1 to 5)”. This fitment formula clearly envisioned the fixation in the H MAHARASHTRA STATE FINANCIAL CORP. EX- EMPLOYEES 1189 ASSOC. v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] new scales, even if notionally, from 01.01.1996. Arrears were made A payable, based on that fitment and fixation, with effect from 01.01.2006. 31.
