Thus, the aged father-in-law has also been put under considerable difficulty due to the marital dispute between the petitioner and the respondent, which also has an obvious impact on the mind of the respondent in how he perceives the acts of the petitioner and his relationship with her. 9.6 Be that as it may, on 29.06.2022, respondent had consulted his advocate to draft a divorce petition and also a private complaint. This is less than one year from the date of their marriage and after living together only for a few months. Thereafter, after visiting Indore and Bhopal, respondent left for USA on 10.07.2022. Respondent returned from USA to India on 25.07.2022. 31.07.2022 was their first wedding anniversary and on the very next day, i.e., on 01.08.2022, divorce petition bearing No.1146/2022 was filed before the Family Court at Bhopal by the respondent. On 08.08.2022, petitioner received the summons in the aforesaid case. On 13.08.2022, the said divorce petition was withdrawn and a second divorce petition bearing No.1215/2022 was filed under Section 13B of HMA. Even while respondent was in India, second divorce petition bearing No.1215/2022 was dismissed and the petitioner left for her parental home at Kota on 31.08.2022. This was because the statutory period of separation for a year had not been complied. Shortly thereafter, on 03.09.2022, a third divorce petition was filed by the respondent before the Family Court at Bhopal. Respondent also sought revocation of the USA visa which had been applied for the petitioner. 1386 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 9.7 The aforesaid facts would indicate that on very next day after year of marriage, the respondent filed the first divorce petition which was dismissed and simultaneously, a second joint petition was filed which was also dismissed due to non-compliance with Section 13B(1) of HMA. It was followed by a third divorce petition. Thus, within a span of 34 days, the respondent filed three divorce petitions. 9.8 The aforesaid events would clearly indicate that there was no meaningful relationship between the parties inasmuch as the respondent was making endeavours to put an end to his marriage with the petitioner by filing successive divorce petitions. Hence, the intention of the respondent was not to continue his marital relationship with the petitioner. 9.9 Further, the petitioner herein filed her first complaint against the employee of the respondent’s company and also respondent’s aunt’s grandson under Section 506 of the IPC which was converted into the FIR bearing No.586/2022 dated 12.12.2022. She filed a complaint against her father-in-law on 25.11.2022 and a complaint against the respondent on 15.12.2022 which was converted as FIR No.588/2022 under Sections 420, 354, 503, 506, 509, 376, 377 and 498A of the IPC. On the said complaint, the respondent was arrested from the Mumbai Airport on the basis of a look out Circular and was in custody for a month. It is only after seeking bail that he could manage to leave the shores of India for USA. 9.10 Thus, what emerges from the aforesaid facts are that: i) the marriage between the parties did not really take off at all; ii) there was no continuous cohabitation between the parties at a place.
