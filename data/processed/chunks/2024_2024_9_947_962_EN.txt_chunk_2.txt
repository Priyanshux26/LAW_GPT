The relevant facts giving rise to the original suit are as follows: 2.1 Late Surendranath Banerjee was the original owner of the suit property situated in Baripada, Odisha.

As per the terms of the agreement, the sale deed was to be executed before 30.09.1993. 2.4 It is pertinent to note that the agreement dated 06.06.1993 was executed solely by Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra, without any signatures, written consent, or explicit authorization from Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, who collectively held a significant 3/5th share in the property.
