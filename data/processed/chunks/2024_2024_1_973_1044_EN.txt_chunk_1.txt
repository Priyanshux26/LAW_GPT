[Para 45, 47] Administrative Law – Distinction between the legislative function and administrative function: [2024] 1 S.C.R. 975 The State of Himachal Pradesh and Others v. Yogendera Mohan Sengupta and Another Held: A legislative act is the creation and promulgation of a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases; whereas an administrative act is the making and issue of a specific direction or the application of a general rule to a particular case in accordance with the requirements of policy – Legislation is the process of formulating a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases and usually operating in future – Whereas, administration is the process of performing particular acts of issuing particular s or of making decisions which apply general rules to particular cases – It has also been held that rule-making is normally directed towards the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class; whereas an adjudication, on the other hand, applies to specific individuals or situations – In the instant case, it will be amply clear that the preparation of draft development plan u/s. 18 of the Himachal Pradesh Town & Country Planning Act, 1977, finalization of the same u/s. 19 of the TCP Act by the Director and grant of approval by the State u/s. 20 of the TCP Act are all legislative functions – The provisions enable the delegated legislative body to formulate the provisions which will have a general application to all members of the broadly identifiable classes. [Paras 50, 51] Himachal Pradesh Town & Country Planning Act, 1977 – Whether the NGT could have issued directions to the legislative body to exercise its legislative functions in a particular manner: Held: A perusal of the first (16.11.2017) of NGT would reveal that the NGT, in effect, has issued directions to the authority empowered to enact the development plan, to do so in a particular manner – It is a settled law that the Constitution of India does not permit the courts to direct or advise the Executive in the matters of policy or to sermonize qua any matter which under the Constitution lies within the sphere of Legislature or Executive – It is also settled that the courts cannot issue directions to the Legislature for enacting the laws in a particular manner or for amending the Acts or the Rules – It is for the Legislature to do so – It is also a settled position of law that neither the High Courts while exercising powers u/Art. 226 of the Constitution nor the Supreme Court while exercising powers u/Art. 32 of the Constitution can direct the legislature or its delegatee to enact a law or subordinate legislation in a particular manner – If the High Courts and the Supreme Court, in their extra-ordinary powers u/Arts. 226 and 32 of the Constitution 976 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports cannot do so, the answer to the question as to whether a Tribunal constituted under a statute, having a limited jurisdiction, can do so or not, would be in negative – The first of NGT is liable to be set aside on the short ground that it has transgressed its limitations and attempted to encroach upon the field reserved for the delegatee to enact a piece of delegated legislation – When the TCP Act empowers the State Government and the Director to exercise the powers to enact a piece of delegated legislation, the NGT could not have imposed fetters on such powers and directed it to exercise its powers in a particular manner.
