Following many reminders by the respondent regarding the non payment of the final bill, according to the respondent, it sent a list of additional C claims on 25.02.2003 and in the said letter, claimed that the letter and the Final bill should be considered as under protest.

An undertaking was also got signed from the D respondent on 12.09.2003.
