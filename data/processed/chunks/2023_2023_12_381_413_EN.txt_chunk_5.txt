True, it is she is the wife of the deceased; but she cannot be called an ‘interested’ witness. She is related to the deceased. ‘Related’ is not equivalent to ‘interested’. A witness may be called ‘interested’ only when he or she derives some benefi t from the result of a litigation; in the decree in a civil case, or in seeing an accused person punished. A witness who is a natural one and is the only possible eye witness in the circumstances of a case cannot be said to be ‘interested’. In the instant case P.W. 1 had no interest in protecting the real culprit, and falsely implicating the respondents.” 47. Besides, the other prosecution witnesses namely PW-17, PW-23, PW-29, PW-30, PW-33, PW-34, PW-35, PW-36, PW-37, PW-38, PW-39, PW-40, PW-41. PW-42, PW-43, PW-44 · and PW-46 are not related to the deceased or Mangat Ram. Said witnesses have deposed that they received gunshot wounds on 11.11.1998 at around 3/3:30 PM. Out of said 17 witnesses, PW-23, PW-29, PW-33, PW-37, PW- 38, PW-39, PW-40, PW-41, PW-42, PW-43, PW-44 and PW-46 have categorically deposed that they were present at Gali No.300 when they received the gunshot wounds. The other witnesses have not stated as to where they were standing when they received the gunshot wounds. PW-23, PW-29, PW-33, PW-37, PW-38, PW-39, PW-40, PW-41, PW-42, PW-43, PW-44 and PW-46 are not related to each other or to the deceased or to any other witness of the prosecution, They would have no motive to falsely depose. The testimony of said witnesses establishes that the fi ring was directed towards people who were on street No.300. The house of Babu Ram is abutting street No.400, which as noted in para 11 above, runs parallel to street No.300 and the two streets are separated by a row of houses constructed back to back. In SUNIL v. STATE OF NCT OF DELHI 389 [MANOJ MISRA, J.] no way can an unruly crowd which has assembled on street No.300 set on fi re any house which is on street No.400. Further, the falsity in the testimony of the defence witnesses who claim that Babu Ram, acting in defence of his house and himself and his family members, fi red from the roof of his house is apparent from the fact that standing on the roof of house No.366 which is the house of Babu Ram, it is just not possible to hit anybody standing on street No.300. A little bit of geometry would show the same. Standing on any point at the roof of the house of Babu Ram, the straight line connecting the said spot from any portion of his roof to any spot on street No.300 would pass through the roof· and the walls of house No. D-355, D-356 and D-357 abutting street No.300 on its northern boundary. 48. Besides, there is no evidence of any kerosene oil or petrol being detected outside the house of Babu Ram. This also falsifi es the defence version that the riotous mob was threatening to burn down the house of Babu Ram.
