The respondent replied by its letter of 04.03.2011 and insisted on the affidavit as sought for by setting out the following reasons: “(i) at the time of submission of bid, the Mega Policy 2006 was in vogue and therefore, the Project could not have qualified as a MPP; (ii) the Mega Policy 2009 was notified on 14.12.2009, post submission of the bids and therefore, the benefits could have only accrued post such notification; (iii) the mega power status is granted to a project subject to (a) project getting certified as a MPP from an officer not below the rank of Joint Secretary to the Ministry of Power; (b) the power purchasing States having constituted the Regulatory Commissions with full power to fix tariffs; (c) power purchasing States undertaking to carry out distribution reforms as laid down by the Ministry of Power; (iv) the distribution reforms took place in Punjab in April, 2010 and hence, the bidders could not have considered benefits available under the Mega Policy 2009 prior to the submission of the bid; and (v) in relation to the Project, the Petitioner No.1 had applied to the Ministry of Power for grant of mega power status to the Project on 11.05.2010 and the Ministry of Power had granted the said status vide its letter dated 30.07.2010.” 19.
