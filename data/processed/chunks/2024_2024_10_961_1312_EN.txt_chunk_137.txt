The Assam Company which was started in 1839 became the first joint-stock company of India to be incorporated with limited liabilities under an Act of Parliament in August, 1845.26 28. In 1858, with India coming under the rule of the British Crown as a unified territory, the growing demand of labour in tea-plantations and the expanding agriculture provided an opportunity to the planters to import cheap indentured labour from across India to the fertile valleys of Brahmaputra River in Assam. 29. This migration was accompanied by an influx of Bengali speaking population into positions of administrative services. The British dismantled the existing structure of governance, made Bengali the official language and recruited Bengali speaking populace to run 24 Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873, Regulation 2, Regulation 5 of 1873. 25 The Charter Act, 1833, Chapter No. 85, Acts of Parliament (U.K.). 26 The Assam Company Act, 1845, No. 19 of 1845, Acts of Parliament (U.K.). 1156 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the administration.27 Assam was more sparsely populated than East Bengal. As a result, the Bengali speaking population coming from East Bengal reclaimed thousands of acres of land, cleared vast tracts of dense jungle along the south bank of the Brahmaputra, and occupied flooded lowlands all along the river.28 30. However, owing to the inconvenience of governing the Assam districts as a division of the Bengal Presidency and on the demand of the tea planters, Assam Proper, Cachar, Goalpara, Sylhet and Hill District were constituted as a separate Chief Commissioner’s province of Assam, also known as the North East Frontier, with capital at Shillong. With this development, Assamese, which had been replaced with Bengali as the official language during the annexation of Assam in 1830s, was reinstated alongside Bengali as the official language. However, Assam’s status as a separate province came to an end on 16.10.1905 and it was reconstituted as a part of the newly born composite province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. 31. The partition of Bengal was short-lived because of the rise of anti- British sentiment on account of their policies which led the British to attempt to bring about political stability in the territory of India. At the Delhi Durbar held on 12.12.1911, the partition of Bengal was annulled by a royal declaration. Assam-Sylhet was formally reverted to its old status as a Chief Commissioner’s province with effect from 01.04.1912. The province of East Bengal was reorganized by removing Assam from East Bengal, and Assam was constituted as a separate administrative province. 32. In 1937, the Government of India Act, 1935 (“GOI Act, 1935”) came into force. With the introduction of the GOI Act, 1935, the territory of Burma ceded from India and Assam was incorporated as a territory of India. ii. Post-Independence 33. The Indian Independence Bill, 1947 proposed that all of Sylhet would become a part of East Bengal. After partition, Sylhet district was transferred to East Pakistan by a referendum. 27 Myron Weiner, The Political Demography of Assam’s Anti-Immigrant Movement, 9, popul.
