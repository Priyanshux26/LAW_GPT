74. We have also looked into the case law relied upon by the learned counsel appearing for the respective appellants in support of C their submissions. However, it is not necessary for us to discuss each one of the decisions relied upon as none of the decisions are of any avail to the appellant. Each of the decisions are in the peculiar facts of the case. 75. In view of the aforesaid discussion, both the appeals are liable D to be dismissed. However, before we proceed to pass the final , there is one grey area in this litigation whichwe must look into and say something in that regard. Of course, this grey area has not been ventured into by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants, but as a highest Court of the Country, we should not shut our eyes to the same. E AN EYE-OPENER LITIGATION FOR THE NIA/STATE POLICE 76. As is evident from the chronology of dates and events referred to in the earlier part of our , the final report under Section 173(2) of the CrPC was filed in the Court of SDJM, Ajnala on 15.11.2019. F 15.11.2019 was the 161st day from the date of arrest of two of the appellants before us, namely, Jasbir Singh and Varinder Singh. They were the first to be arrested on 08.06.2019. The Punjab Police applied to the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar, for extension of time to complete the investigation invoking the proviso to Section 43D(2)(b) of the UAPA on 04.09.2019. When this application for G extension of time was filed only two days were left for 90 days to expire. This is suggestive of the fact that the 91st day would have fallen on 07.09.2019. What is important to highlight is that the Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar, looked into the extension application dated 04.09.2019 filed by the Punjab Police and ultimately, extended the time limit vide its H dated 17.09.2019 i.e., on the 101st day. By the time, the Additional JUDGEBIR SINGH @ JASBIR SINGH SAMRA @ JASBIR 53 v. NATIONAL INVESTIGATION AGENCY [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] Sessions Judge, Amritsar, passed an extending the time, the period A of 90 days had already expired. Indisputably, there was no chargesheet before the Court on the 91st day i.e., on 07.09.2019. The reason why we say that this is a grey area is because what would have happened if the appellants Jasbir Singh and Varinder Singh had preferred an application seeking statutory/default bail under Section 167(2) of the CrPC on the B 91st day i.e., on 07.09.2019. The application seeking extension of time was very much pending. The Additional Sessions Judge could not have even allowed such application promptly i.e., on or before the 90th day without giving notice to the accused persons. The law is now well settled in view of the decision of this Court in the case of Jigar alias Jimmy Pravinchandra Aditya v. State of Gujarat reported in 2022 SCC OnLine C SC 1290 that an opportunity of hearing has to be given to the accused persons before the time is extended up to 180 days to complete the investigation.
