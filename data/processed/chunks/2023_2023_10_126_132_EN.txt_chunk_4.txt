The impugned cannot, therefore, be sustained inter alia for this F reason. We are also of the opinion that the question relating to existence of the ground of bona fide need which has been decided in favour of the tenant requires a fresh determination by the High Court along with the other point relating to default in payment of rent which was the subject mater of cross- objection.......” G 22. The abovementioned discussions and s, when contextualized to the present case, would show that the High Court 2 (2001) 4 SCC 756 3 (1998) 9 SCC 383 H 132 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R.
