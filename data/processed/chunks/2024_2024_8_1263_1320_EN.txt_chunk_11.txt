Even in the present case, the Liquidator had to move an application before the Adjudicating Authority for appropriate directions. The said application was allowed on 10th February, 2020. However, the passed on 10th February, 2020 was received by the Liquidator only on 14th May, 2020. Due to several hindrances on account of the COVID-19 situation, the actual attachment of the subject property was lifted only on 27th August, 2020. Just a few days before that, the Auction Purchaser deposited the balance sale consideration on 24th August, 2020 and the sale transaction was finally completed on 28th August, 2020. 17. Countering the submission made on behalf of the appellant that Clause 12 of Schedule I under Regulation 33 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 requires the successful bidder to pay the balance sale consideration within 90 days from the date of the demand which 32 For short ‘IT Act’ 33 BMM Ispat Ltd. v.

In the present case, the said steps could be taken only after the attachment was lifted by the Income Tax authorities. 18. Learned senior counsel relied on Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited and Another v. Union of India and Others34 and Prakash Chandra Kapoor and Another v. Vijay Kumar Iyer and Another,35 to contend that the model timeline for the liquidation process contemplated under Regulation 47 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 for completing the liquidation process, are only directory in nature. 19. Learned senior counsel for the Auction Purchaser concluded by highlighting the conduct of the appellant and stated that he had repeatedly failed to pay the monies due; he attempted to stall the auction process; he refused to remove the bar operating from the subject premises and police assistance had to be taken to take over physical possession of the subject property. Therefore, concurrent findings returned by the Adjudicating Authority and the Tribunal being well reasoned, do not deserve interference. Lastly, learned counsel submitted that without prejudice to the above submission, in the event this Court is of the opinion that the provisions of Rule 12 of Schedule I of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 are mandatory and the Adjudicating Authority was not empowered to extend the timelines for paying the balance sale consideration, then this Court may exercise its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to do complete justice but the auction sale may not be set aside.
