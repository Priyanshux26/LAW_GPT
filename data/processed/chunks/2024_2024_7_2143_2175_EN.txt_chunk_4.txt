By the impugned of the NCLAT, both appeals have been dismissed. 3. M/s. Zaveri & Co. Pvt. Ltd. has filed I.A. No.11685 of 2023 for intervention. It is stated in the application that the applicant and other interested parties had submitted the resolution plan of the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor. A final resolution plan was submitted by the applicant on 23rd August 2021, proposing to pay a sum of Rs.135 crores within a period of 15 months to the creditors of the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor. The COC of the 2nd respondent- corporate debtor approved the resolution plan of the applicant on [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2149 BRS Ventures Investments Ltd. v. SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd. & Anr. 30th August 2021. As required by the approved resolution plan, the applicant has furnished a bank guarantee of Rs.2 crores on 3rd September 2021. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT 4. Mr. Jaideep Gupta, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, submitted that in the CIRP of ACIL, the appellant’s resolution plan was duly approved. As per the resolution plan, a sum of Rs.38.87 crores was paid to the 1st respondent-financial creditor, which was in full and final settlement of the dues of the 1st respondent-financial creditor. He submitted that upon such payment being made by the appellant, Section 140 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (for short, ‘the Contract Act’) would squarely apply as the rights of the 1st respondent-financial creditor shall stand subrogated in favour of the appellant. Therefore, through ACIL, the appellant would step into the shoes of the 1st respondent-financial creditor. He would, thus, submit that the appellant has the right of subrogation over the right of the financial creditor over the principal borrower (corporate debtor) in respect of its dues as well as the security provided to the financial creditor of the mortgage in respect of SEZ land. He submitted that upon payment of Rs.38.87 crores to the 1st respondent-financial creditor, as a full and final settlement of its total dues of Rs.241.27 crores, the appellant has now stepped into the shoes of the 1st respondent-financial creditor. He relied on this Court’s decision in the case of Amit Lal Goverdhan Lalan v. State Bank of Travancore & Ors.1 5. The learned senior counsel further submitted that for attracting Section 140 of the Contract Act, the payment by the guarantor does not have to be of the entire amount due from the principal debtor. Even a partial payment made in the full and final settlement is sufficient to trigger the principle of subrogation. He placed reliance on a decision of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Shib Charan Das v. Muqaddam & Ors.2 He submitted that the High Court of Karnataka, in the case of Kadamba Sugar Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. Devru Ganapathi Hegde Bhairi3 has held that acceptance of the 1 [1968] 3 SCR 724 2 AIR 1936 ALL 62 3 1993 SCC Online KAR 7 2150 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports lesser amount by the creditor under the complete satisfaction of the dues paid by the surety, entitled surety to the right of subrogation.
