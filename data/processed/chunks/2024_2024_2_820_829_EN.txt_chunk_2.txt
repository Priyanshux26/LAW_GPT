109.7. The applications of the serving officers for the grant of PCs shall be considered on the basis of the norms contained in Regulation 203 namely : (I) availability of vacancies in the stabilised cadre at the material time; (ii) determination of suitability; and (iii) recommendation of the Chief of the Naval Staff. Their empanelment shall be based on inter se merit evaluated on the ACRs of the officers under consideration, subject to the availability of vacancies. 824 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 109.8. SSC officers who are found suitable for the grant of PC shall be entitled to all consequential benefits including arrears of pay, promotions and retiral benefits as and when due. 109.9. Women SSC officers of the ATC cadre in Annie Nagaraja case [Annie Nagaraja v. Union of India, 2015 SCC OnLine Del 11804] are not entitled to consideration for the grant of PCs since neither men nor women SSC officers are considered for the grant of PCs and there is no direct induction of men officers to PCs. In exercise of the power conferred by Article 142 of the Constitution, we direct that as a one-time measure, SSC officers in the ATC cadre in Annie Nagaraja case [Annie Nagaraja v. Union of India, 2015 SCC OnLine Del 11804] shall be entitled to pensionary benefits. SSC officers in the ATC cadre in Priya Khurana case [Priya Khurana v. Union of India, 2016 SCC OnLine AFT 798], being inducted in pursuance of the specific representation contained in the advertisements pursuant to which they were inducted, shall be considered for the grant of PCs in accordance with Directions 109.5 and 109.6 above. 109.10. All SSC women officers who were denied consideration for the grant of PCs on the ground that they were inducted prior to the issuance of the Letter dated 26-9- 2008 and who are not presently in service shall be deemed, as a one-time measure, to have completed substantive pensionable service. Their pensionary benefits shall be computed and released on this basis. No arrears of salary shall be payable for the period after release from service. 109.11. As a one-time measure, all SSC women officers who were before the High Court and AFT who are not granted PCs shall be deemed to have completed substantive qualifying service for the grant of pension and shall be entitled to all consequential benefits.” 4. The petitioner was an officer who was recruited before the Policy Letter6 of 26 September 2008 was issued. The PL stipulated that while 6 “PL” [2024] 2 S.C.R. 825 CDR Seema Chaudhary v. Union of India and Others women SSCOs would be considered for grant of PC in stipulated branches (JAG, Education and Naval Architecture), the letter would have prospective effect. It was as a result of the application of the PL dated 26 September 2008 that the petitioner was initially not considered to be eligible for the grant of PC. In the directions contained in paragraph 109.1 and 109.2, extracted above, this Court noted that the statutory bar on the enrolment of women in the Indian Navy was lifted in terms of the notifications issued by the Union Government on 9 October 1991 and 6 November 1998 under Section 9(2) of the Navy Act.
