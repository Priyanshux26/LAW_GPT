[2024] 8 S.C.R. 207 : 2024 INSC 578 Government of NCT of Delhi v. Office of Lieutenant Governor of Delhi (Writ Petition (Civil) No. 348 of 2023) 05 August 2024 [Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI, Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha* and J.B. Pardiwala, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the Lt. Governor can exercise power of nomination under Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 as a statutory duty attached to his office or he is bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of NCTD as provided in Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution of India. Headnotes† Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 – s.3(3)(b)(i) – Interpretation – Delhi Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act No. 67 of 1993 – Constitution (Sixty-Ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 – Article 239AA(4), 239AB – Government of National Capital Territory Act, 1991 – ss.41-45 – Nomination of 10 persons with special knowledge in municipal administration to the Delhi Municipal Corporation, by the Lt. Governor u/s.3(3) (b)(i) – Whether to be on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers or the Lt. Governor is to act as per his discretion: Held: s.3(3)(b)(i) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act is a Parliamentary enactment vesting the power of nomination of persons with special knowledge in municipal administration with the Lt. Governor – The said power is to be exercised as a statutory duty of the Lt. Governor and not as the executive power of the Government of NCTD – The context in which the power is located confirms that the Lt. Governor is intended to act as per the mandate of the statute and not to be guided by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers – Notifications issued by the Lt. Governor u/s.3(3)(b)(i) nominating ten members to the Corporation are not in violation of Article 239AA r/w s.41 of the GNCTD Act. [Paras 39, 38, 40] * Author 208 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Constitution of India – Articles 163, 239AA(4) – Discretionary power under – Distinction – Plea that the position of the Lt. Governor is akin to that of a Governor in a State u/Article 163: Held: Rejected – There is a clear distinction between the discretionary power of the Governor u/Article 163 and that of the Lt. Governor u/Article 239AA(4) – While Article 163 requires Governor of a State to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, ‘except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion’, the exception in so far as the Lt. Governor, under Article 239AA(4) is concerned, he will act in his discretion, ‘in so far as he is required by or under any law’ – Article 239AA takes into account the unique position of NCTD and therefore adopts the mandate of ‘law’ as a distinct feature for exercise of discretion. [Para 21] Constitution of India – Article 239AA(3)(a),(b),(c), 239AA(4) – Legislative, Executive, Statutory relations between the Union and National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD) – Reiterated.
