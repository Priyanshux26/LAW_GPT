However, this is not going to make any STATE THROUGH CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION v. 165 HEMENDHRA REDDY & ANOTHER. ETC. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] difference. What is necessary to be examined is as to whether an A passed under Section 190(1) of the CrPC accepting a final report being a judicial would bar further investigation by the police or the CBI as in the present case, in exercise of the statutory powers under chapter XII of the CrPC? 68. In State of Rajasthan v. Aruna Devi and Others reported in B (1995) 1 SCC 1, a complaint was filed in the Court of Munsif and Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Bilara, against the respondents under various sections of the IPC. The gravamen of the allegation was that the respondents had, in pursuance of a conspiracy, transferred some land on the strength of a special power of attorney bearing forged signature. C The Magistrate, after perusal of the complaint, directed an investigation to be made as contemplated by Section 156(3) of the CrPC. A case was registered thereafter, by the police and a final report was submitted on 18.07.1981 stating that complaint was false. The report came to be accepted by the Magistrate on 23.09.1981. It, however, so happened that the Superintendent of Police had independently ed further D investigation on 24.09.1981 and a challan came to be filed by police against the respondents, inter alia, under Sections 420 and 467 of the IPC. The Magistrate took cognizance on 25.06.1984. A challenge was made to this act of the Magistrate before Sessions Judge, Jodhpur, who dismissed the revision. On further approach to the High Court, the revision E was allowed and the of cognizance was set aside. The State came in appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution. 69. This Court observed in paras 3 and 4 respectively as under: 3. A perusal of the impugned of the High Court shows that it took the view that the Magistrate had no F jurisdiction to take cognizance after the final report submitted by police had been once accepted. Shri Gupta, appearing for the appellant, contends that this view is erroneous in law inasmuch as Section 173(8) of the Code permits further investigation in respect of an offence after a report under G sub-section (2) has been submitted. Sub-section (8) also visualises forwarding of another report to the Magistrate. Further investigation had thus legal sanction and if after such further investigation a report is submitted that an offence was committed, it would be open to the Magistrate to take cognizance of the same on his being satisfied in this regard. H 166 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A 4. Shri Francis for the respondents, however, contends that the of the Magistrate taking cognizance pursuant to filing of further report amounted to entertaining second complaint which is not permissible in law. To substantiate the legal submission, we have been first referred to Pramatha Nath Taluqdar v. Saroj Ranjan Sarkar [1962 Supp (2) SCR B 297 : AIR 1962 SC 876 : (1962) 1 Cri LJ 770] , in which a three-Judge Bench of this Court dealt with this aspect.
