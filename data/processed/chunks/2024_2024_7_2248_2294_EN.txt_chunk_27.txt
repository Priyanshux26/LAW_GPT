183/2000 has been mechanically relied upon without considering its applicability to the case at hand; that the sale deeds relied upon related to small non-agricultural plots which had construction potentiality and are not comparable instances. The State further argued that in another First Appeal No. 1210 of 2008 arising from LAC No. 140/2000 (subject matter of the Appeal in Civil Appeal Nos. 6776-6777 of 2013 herein), the Appeal of the State was allowed and the compensation fixed at Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. was set aside and the compensation fixed by the Land Acquisition Officer at Rs. 5.30/- per sq. ft. was restored. 86. Mr. Nishant Katneshwarkar, learned counsel for the appellant contended that though the land is situated in Village Hingana Mhaispur, the said village is separated from Village Akoli (Bk) only by a bullock-cart track; that civic amenities were available in and around the acquired land; that the land had construction potentiality; that the in LAC No.183/2000 was not the only basis and that sale deeds dated 04.05.1999 (Exh.40), 11.06.1998 (Exh.41) and 15.07.1998 (Exh.42) were relied upon which showed that the land located in the same vicinity was sold @ of Rs. 110/- per sq. ft., Rs. 60/- per sq. ft. and Rs. 50/- per sq. ft. It was also submitted that there was no evidence to show that the land was along the riverbank and was prone to flooding. It was also submitted that the in First Appeal No. 1210 of 2008 (subject matter in Civil Appeal Nos.6776-6777 of 2013 herein) had not attained finality. 87. The High Court, in the impugned , proceeded as if the only basis of the of the Reference Court was the in LAC No. 183/2000. That is clear from the reading of para 8 of [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2283 Kazi Akiloddin v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. the impugned which states that “the Reference Court has determined the market rate of the acquired land on the basis of the in LAC No.183/2000.” This may not be entirely an accurate statement as a careful perusal of the portions of the Reference Court extracted herein above indicates that the in LAC No. 183/2000 was an additional factor. Be that as it may, the High Court held that the land in LAC No. 183/2000 pertained to a small plot, namely, Survey No. 7/2 which was converted to non-agricultural use way back in the year 1982. It was also found that unlike the present plot, the land that was subject matter in LAC No. 183/2000 was not on the riverbank. The High Court found that the sale deed of 04.05.1999 (Exh.40) was a post notification transaction. As far as the sale deeds dated 11.06.1998 (Exh.41) and 15.07.1998 (Exh.42) are concerned, the High Court held that they pertained to plot nos. 117, 162 and 12 respectively carved out from Survey Nos. 6, 7 and 60 of village Akoli (Khurd) which was converted to non-agricultural land way back in the year 1982. Thereafter, the High Court held as follows: “11.
