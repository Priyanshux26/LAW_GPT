22.2. Referring to Section 139 (9) (f) of the Act, he submits that even in the absence of regular books of accounts, the assessee is bound to provide the information required under the aforesaid provision. An assessee who does not disclose the above information and instead submits returns on estimation basis cannot claim that it has fully and truly disclosed all material facts required for assessment. 22.3. According to Mr. Gopal, Tribunal erred in holding that the assessee had disclosed fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment. In fact, Tribunal did not go into the merit of the case. Rather, Tribunal held that there were no materials before the assessing officer to take the view that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment. 22.4. Learned counsel for the revenue strenuously argued that assessing officer had made a comparative analysis of the two balance sheets, one as on 31.12.1985 relevant to the assessment year 1986-1987 and the balance sheet dated 31.03.1994 relevant to the assessment year 1994–1995 and found therefrom unexplained increase in the capital and current accounts of the partners. That apart, the assessing officer also obtained a balance sheet for the assessment year 1988–1989 from the South Indian Bank which also indicated unexplained profits and gains of the partners. It was thereafter that reassessment proceedings were initiated. First appellate authority i.e. CIT(A) not only affirmed the reassessment s of the assessing officer but also enhanced the quantum of escaped income which was restored by the High Court after setting aside the reversal of the Tribunal. 22.5. Learned counsel for the respondent has submitted a convenience compilation and drew the attention of the Court therefrom to the relevant provisions of the Act i.e. Section 139 (9), 143, 144, 145, 147, 148, 149 and 151 of the Act, both pre 660 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 01.04.1989 and post 01.04.1989. He submits that there was admittedly non-disclosure of material facts by the assessee, and, therefore, the extended period under the proviso to Section 147 of the Act was available to the department. Viewed in the above context, the notices issued under Section 148 of the Act as well as the s of reassessment passed under Section 144/147 of the Act were within limitation. 22.6. Learned counsel has specifically referred to Section 149 of the Act which deals with the time limit for issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act. Post amendment with effect from 01.04.1989, he submits that under Section 149 (1) (b) (iii), the limitation is, if seven years but not more than ten years had elapsed from the relevant assessment year unless the income chargeable to tax which has escaped assessment amounts to or is likely to amount to rupees fifty thousand or more for that year. In the instant case, the quantum of escaped assessment is admittedly in excess of rupees fifty thousand. Therefore, the notices issued under Section 148 of the Act on 29.03.2000 for the three assessment years of 1990 – 1991, 1991 – 1992 and 1992 – 1993 were well within the limitation period.
