R1 was before the concerned authorities, by way of representation, well in time, and much before even the Notifi cation dated 02/05.08.2023 was published, by impugning the Notifi cation dated 26.07.2023 which denied it the Plough symbol. R1 had moved the ECI, which opined, by way of communication dated 18.07.2023 that the ECI does not allocate any symbol for local body elections as the same falls within the domain of the State Election Commission concerned. The ECI stated that as there is no Legislative Assembly in the Union Territory of Ladakh and the 1968 does not provide for recognition to parties in a Union Territory without a Legislative Assembly, R1 could not be recognised in the Union Territory of Ladakh. However, it was further noted that as R1 is a recognized State Party in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir with its reserved symbol being the Plough, it could avail concession under Paragraph 103 of the 1968 . 3 Already extracted supra. 92 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 24. On 15.05.2023, the ECI updated its Notifi cation dated 23.09.2021 specifying the names of recognised National and State Parties and the list of free symbols where R1 was again recognised as a State Party, though for the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir only. On 31.05.2023, R1 made a representation to the Appellant No.2 seeking recognition as a State Party and for the allotment of the Plough symbol to it for all elections in the Union Territory of Ladakh. Appellant No.2 forwarded the said representation to Appellant No.3 for comments. On 07.06.2023, Appellant No.3 advised Appellant No.2 to approach the ECI. On 08.06.2023, R1 sought recognition as a State Party in the Union Territory of Ladakh and allotment of the Plough symbol. 25. On 07.07.2023, R1 represented to Appellant No.2 seeking recognition as a State Party in the Union Territory of Ladakh with the Plough symbol. Appellant No.2 forwarded the said representation to Appellant No.3 on 11.07.2023 and sought comments thereon. On 12.07.2023, Appellant No.3 wrote to Appellant No.2, incorporating the opinion of the Law Department, which was in favour of R1. Appellant No.3 indicated that R1 can be recognised and provided reserved symbol for LAHDC elections by the Administration of Union Territory of Ladakh under the relevant rules. 26. No action was taken and no was passed pursuant to Appellant No.3’s communication dated 12.07.2023 to Appellant No.2. Then, the Election Department of the Union Territory of Ladakh issued a Notifi cation on 26.07.2023 notifying the list of reserved and free symbols, in terms of the ECI’s Notifi cation dated 15.05.2023. R1 approached the High Court on 29.07.2023 challenging the notifi cation dated 26.07.2023 and seeking a mandamus to notify the Plough symbol as its reserved symbol for elections to LAHDC. The Writ Petition being pending, on 05.08.2023, the Election Department of the Union Territory of Ladakh notifi ed the schedule of elections to constitute the 5th LAHDC, Kargil. In such background, an interim came to be passed by the learned Single Judge and affi rmed by the learned Division Bench.
