15 did not belong to Scheduled Tribe community, as was even the status mentioned in two affi davits dated 06.07.2000 and 02.08.2000 sworn by him before Notary Public and Executive Magistrate, respectively. 40. There is nothing produced on record to show that late Ramanand Baraik, father of respondent No. 15 was ever issued any certifi cate showing him belonging to Scheduled Tribe community. The sale deeds in question were registered on 30.08.1983. It shows that on the basis of a certifi cate, which was issued subsequently in favour of respondent No. 15, he sought to challenge one of the various sale deeds executed by his late father Ramanand Baraik during his life time. Even at the time of death of late Ramanand Baraik, father of respondent No. 15, in the year 1991, respondent No. 15 was more than 18 years of age. The sale deeds in question in isolation were sought to be challenged only in the year 2004, even though the certifi cate of Scheduled Tribe community was issued in favour of respondent No. 15 in the year 1993. 41. Considering the aforesaid facts, in our opinion, the present appeal deserves to be allowed. ed accordingly. The dated 30.03.2015 passed by the High Court is set aside. It will be an exercise in futility to remit the matter back to any authority for examination as we do not fi nd any merit in the claim of respondent No. 15. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed.
