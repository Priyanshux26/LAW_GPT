From the dated 2.04.2019 passed in Cr.M.P. No.5003/2018, it is quite discernible that the Trial court after meticulously examining the allegations made in the complaint and the evidence of the complainant and one witness, had taken the cognizance, with regard to the aforesaid offences only and had not taken cognizance B of the other offences alleged under Sections 409, 418, 420, 465, 467 and 468 of IPC which shows proper application of mind by the Trial Court before issuing the summons to the appellant and others. 14. As regards the submission made by learned Senior Counsel, Mr. Luthra that the second complaint at the instance of the respondent C no. 2 on the same set of facts against the same accused was not maintainable, it may be noted that the law in this regard is quite well settled since 1962. In case of Pramatha Nath Talukdar Vs. Saroj Ranjan Sarkar3, it was held with regard to filing of the second complaint that a fresh complaint could be entertained after the dismissal of previous D complaint under Section 203 of the Criminal Procedure Code when there was manifest error or manifest miscarriage of justice or when fresh evidence was forthcoming. It was further held that an of dismissal under Section 203 of the Criminal Procedure Code is no bar to the entertainment of a second complaint on the same facts, but it will be entertained only in exceptional circumstances, e.g. that the previous E was passed on an incomplete record or on a misunderstanding of nature of complaint or it was manifestly absurd, unjust or foolish or where new facts which could not, with reasonable diligence, have been brought on record in the previous proceedings have been adduced. The precise observations made in para 48 thereof may be reproduced hereunder : F “48.
