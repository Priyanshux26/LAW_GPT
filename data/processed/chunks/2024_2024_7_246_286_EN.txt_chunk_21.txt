E. Speech must not prejudice the marginalised and disenfranchise them further. 62. Article 19(1)(a) has been termed as “perhaps the most precious of all the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution”.89 Speech and 87 Vikash Kumar (supra) [52, 53, 60] 88 [2021] 13 SCR 823 : (2016) 7 SCC 761 89 Sakal Papers (P) Ltd v.

Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors. expression form a crucial part of the democratic give and take90 and serve as a corrective check on public policy.91 Overall, they promote the discursive health of democracy92. Social debate must be enriched by diverse voices and wide participation from across the social spectrum.93 Unfortunately, normative stereotypes about gender, identity, sexual orientation and disability have hitherto deprived certain groups of such participation. In Indibly Creative (supra), we held that while satirical speech effectively exposed social absurdities, hypocrisies and contradictions, even such expression was subject to Article 19(2). This Court had remarked that if such expression, which is otherwise acceptable because it promotes discourse, targets the society’s marginalised, it may “confirm and strengthen people’s prejudices against the group in question, which only marginalises and disenfranchises them more”.94 Such expression, it was held, may not enjoy the complete protection of Article 19(1)(a). F. Caveat: Disability Humour v. Disabling Humour. 63. In the context of historically oppressive representation of persons with disabilities, speech that entrenches stereotypes is opposed to the dignity of such individuals. However, not all speech that uses stereotypes commonly employed against persons with disabilities is abhorrent by reason of such use alone. As stated in the preceding sections, the context, intention and the overall message must be considered before such use may be termed as prejudicial, and the protection of free speech lifted. 64. Humour and disabilities are viewed as uneasy companions. This is primarily because of the historical use of humour to mock disability, make jokes at the expense of persons with disabilities and to use them for comic relief.95 Also, the medical model treats disability as a personal ‘tragedy’ which is by definition, incompatible with humour.96 90 S Rangrajan (supra) [36, 40-43] 91 Maneka Gandhi v.
