It is evident from a plain reading of the above provision that the power to pass a detention is ordinarily that of the State Government under Section 3(1) of the1986 Act. iii. However, such power may, under Section 3(2), be delegated by State Government to a District Magistrate (DM) or Commissioner of 542 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. Police (Commissioner). It is here that the proviso comes in to play and provides that such a delegation in favor of a DM/Commissioner cannot be valid for more than three months at a time. iv. It is therefore clear that the period of “three months” relates not to period of detention but to the duration for which State Government’s empowering theDM or Commissioner to issue detention s can be valid. v. The above view has found favour with this Hon’ble Court in various s including: • Harpreet Kaur (Mrs) Harvinder Singh Bedi v. State of Maharashtra and Anr., (1992) 2 SCC 177 (“Harpreet Kaur”), @para 31-33 • State of Maharashtra & Ors. v. Balu, (2021) 13 SCC 454, @ para 6.3 to 6.6 • T. Devaki vs. Government of Tamil Nadu & Ors., (1990) 2 SCC 456, @para 10 • Aravind Choudhary Vs. State of Telangana, Criminal Appeal No.924/2017 @pg. 2 of the vi. It may be mentioned that the in T. Devaki has been passed by a Benchof three Hon’ble Judges. vii. It is submitted that both the s relied on by the Petitioner (mentioned above)have not taken into account the aforesaid decisions. The period of one year mentioned in the is strictly in accordance with the 1986 Act. viii. At this stage, the scheme of the 1986 Act may be noted: • As mentioned above, a detention is passed either by the State Government or by the Magistrate/Commissioner [as a delegate of the Government], under Section 3(1) or Section 3(2) of the Act respectively. The provision does not require any time period to be specifi ed in the of detention[See T. Devaki @para 10, 12 13 and 15]. PESALA NOOKARAJU v. THE GOVERNMENT OF 543 ANDHRA PRADESH & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] [Note: In the present case, the power was delegated to the DM vide G.O. Rt.No. 1089 dated 09.06.2022 [annexed herewith as Annexure 1] and the detention was passed on 25.08.2022 thereafter – i.e., well within the time of three months.] • Under Section 3(3), an additional safeguard is provided in case when the detention is passed by Magistrate/Commissioner. This Section requires that the detention passed by the DM/ Commissioner shall be confi rmed within a period of 12 days by the State Government, otherwise it lapses after expiry of 12 days. [Note: The of confi rmation, in the present case, was passed by the State Government on 01.09.2022 i.e., within the 12 days’ period.] • Thereafter, under Section 10, the detention along with all relevant material is required to be placed before the Advisory Board within a period of three weeks from the date of detention.
