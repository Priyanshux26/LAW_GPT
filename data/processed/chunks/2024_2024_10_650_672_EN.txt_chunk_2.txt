3.5 The respondent No. 2 Bank, accordingly, lodged a written complaint dated 3rd September 2012. Based on the said complaint, the Central Bureau of Investigation – Economic Offence Wing (CBI-EOW) Chennai registered an FIR No. RC.14/E/2012 dated 15th September 2012. 3.6 The CBI-EOW Chennai after investigation prima facie found that offences punishable under Sections 120-B read with 420, 409, 467, 468 and 471 of Indian Penal Code 1860 (“IPC” for short) and Section 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 (“PC Act” for short) have been committed. The CBI filed charge-sheet dated 27th December 2013 in the trial Court and prayed that the trial Court take cognizance of the said offences committed by the accused persons. 3.7 Since the proceedings before the DRT were still pending, the borrowers/mortgagors (Accused Nos. 1-5) approached the respondent No. 2 Bank for settlement of the amount due regarding the group loan accounts. To that effect, a One Time Settlement (“OTS” for short) dated 19th November 2015 of Rs. 3.8 crores was offered to the respondent No. 2 Bank for settling all the dues. The same was accepted by the respondent No. 2 Bank. The OTS amount was paid, and the respondent No. 2 Bank issued a No Dues Certificate dated 21st November 2015 to the borrowers/guarantors. 3.8 When the matter stood thus, the Accused Nos. 1 to 5, including the present appellants, filed a Criminal Petition bearing No. 5778 of 2016 on 18th April 2016 before the High Court under Section 482 CrPC seeking quashing of the charge-sheet filed before the trial Court by the CBI. 654 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 3.9 During the pendency of the Criminal Petition before the High Court, the DRT vide dated 4th May 2016, recorded that the matter has been settled as per the OTS and disposed of the OA as settled, in full satisfaction of the dues of the respondent No. 2 Bank. 3.10 The High Court, however, vide the impugned final and dismissed the Criminal Petition filed by the Accused Nos. 1 to 5 holding that the settlement arrived at was only a private settlement and was not a part of any decree given by any court. The charges include the use of fraudulent, fake and forged documents that were used to embezzle public money and if these are proved, they would be grave crimes against the society as a whole and hence, merely due to a private settlement between the Bank and the accused, it cannot be said that the prosecution of the accused persons would amount to abuse of process of the court. 3.11 Aggrieved thereby, two of the accused persons (Accused Nos. 3 & 4) have filed the present appeal. 4. We have heard Shri Dama Seshadri Naidu, learned Senior Counsel for the appellants and Shri Vikramjeet Banerjee learned Additional Solicitor General (“ASG” for short) appearing for the CBI, Ms. Devina Sehgal, learned counsel for the respondent No.1-State and Mr. Himanshu Munshi, learned counsel for the respondent No.2-Bank.
