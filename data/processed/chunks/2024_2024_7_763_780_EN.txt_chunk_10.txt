Coming back to the facts of the instance case, there is no dispute that the respondent who started his career as a Lower Division Assistant on 1st June, 1976, was promoted to the post of Upper 26 [2013] 13 SCR 540 : (2013) 8 SCC 693 778 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Division Assistant on an officiating basis with effect from 23rd July, 1980, was granted the first accelerated promotion to the post of Section Officer with effect from 23rd July, 1982, a second accelerated promotion on the post of Section Officer (Senior Grade) with effect from 11th December, 1986, a third accelerated promotion to the post of Administrative Officer with effect from 25th July, 1989, a fourth accelerated promotion to the post of Under Secretary on 9th July, 1995 and finally, a fifth accelerated promotion on the post of Joint Secretary on 5th March, 2003. This goes to show that within a span of ten years five months (from 23rd July, 1982 to 5th March, 2003) the respondent was granted five promotions by the appellant-Board. 26. Much emphasis has been laid by learned counsel for the respondent on the Resolution dated 26th December, 1991 to contend that once the respondent had completed the required period of three years mentioned as Kal Awadhi for promotion from the post of Under Secretary to Joint Secretary, he was automatically entitled for promotion to the next higher post. The said submission is however found to be devoid of merits. 27. Resolution dated 26th December, 1991 prescribed a minimum qualifying service before considering the case of an employee for promotion from one grade to another. The underlying aim of the said resolution is to ensure that an employee gathers sufficient experience as may be required before he can be considered for promotion to the next higher post. But that is not to state that on completion of the duration of Kal Awadhi for promotion, an employee would automatically be entitled for promotion to the next higher post. No employee can lay a claim for being promoted to the next higher post merely on completing the minimum qualifying service. Such an interpretation of the resolution would be fallacious and virtually result in nullifying the settled law of a right inhering in an employee for being considered for promotion being a fundamental right. By no stretch of imagination can a right for being appointed to the promotional post be treated as a vested right. 28. We do not find any error in the stand taken by the appellant-Board in terms of its Resolution dated 9th June, 2005, whereby the respondent’s plea for shifting his date of promotion to the post of Joint Secretary from 5th March, 2003 to 29th July, 1997 was rejected for the reason that there was no vacant post of Joint Secretary during the period [2024] 7 S.C.R. 779 Bihar State Electricity Board and Others v. Dharamdeo Das between 29th July, 1997 to 5th March, 2003 on account of the fact that after the bifurcation of the erstwhile State of Bihar into the present State of Bihar and Jharkhand, vide Resolution dated 6/8th December, 2003 the appellant-Board had taken a calibrated decision to slash the number of sanctioned posts of Joint Secretary from six to three at the headquarters at Patna.
