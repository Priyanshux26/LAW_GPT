Sundresh and Manoj Misra, JJ.) Citizenship Act vis-à-vis the IEAA Citizenship Act, 1955 – s.6A – Special provisions as to citizenship of persons covered by the Assam Accord – Citizenship Act vis-à-vis the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam Act), 1950-IEAA – IEAA, if applicable to the immigrants in Assam, to the exclusion of the Foreigners Act, 1946 – IEAA, if in conflict with the intent and aim of s.6A – Harmonious interpretation of two legislations: Held: (per Surya Kant, J.) (for himself and for M.M. Sundresh and Manoj Misra, JJ.) s.6A is not in conflict with a differently situated statute-IEAA – Instead, IEAA and s.6A can be read harmoniously along with other statutes – IEAA and Foreigners Act, 1946, seek to regulate the residence and departure of foreigners in India – To that extent, no conflict between the Statutes and both of them supplement and complement each other within the framework of s.6A – s.6A need not be construed in a restrictive manner to mean that a person shall be detected and deported only under the Foreigners Act, 1946 – If there is any other piece of legislation such as the IEAA, under which the status of an immigrant can be determined, no reason as to why such statutory detection shall also not be given effect to, for the purposes of deportation – Provisions of IEAA shall also be read into s.6A and be applied along with the Foreigners Act, 1946 for the purpose of 976 [2024] 10 S.C.R.

[Paras 376-382] Interface with International Law Citizenship Act, 1955 – s.6A – Special provisions as to citizenship of persons covered by the Assam Accord – s.6A, if violative of international laws – Plea that since s.6A impacts the culture of original inhabitants, thus, violates Art. 27 of the ICCPR: Held: (per Surya Kant, J.) (for himself and for M.M. Sundresh and Manoj Misra, JJ.) Art. 27 of the ICCPR restricts intervention in one’s culture – s.6A per se does not intervene in culture of Assamese people – Furthermore International law cannot trump domestic law – Thus, s.6A cannot be assailed on the ground of the perceived violation of Art. 27 of the ICCPR as well – Constitution of India – Art. 29 – International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. [Para 386] Temporal Unreasonableness Citizenship Act, 1955 – s.6A(3) – Temporal Unreasonableness – Absence of temporal limit on the applicability of s.6A(3), if renders the said provision manifestly arbitrary and thus violative of Art. 14 – Efflux of time, if has rendered s.6A temporally unreasonable and thus liable to be struck down in consequence of violation of Art. 14 – Placing temporal limitations on the period of applicability, if an objective implicit in the scheme of s.6A – s.6A, if suffers from manifest arbitrariness: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI.)
