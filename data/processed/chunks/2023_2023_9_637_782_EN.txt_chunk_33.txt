The Section empowers the Board also to frame uniform tariffs for such supply. Under Section 79(j) the Board could have made G regulation therefor but admittedly no regulation has so far been made by the Board. The Terms and Conditions of Supply were notified in BPMs No. 690 dated 17-9-1975 in exercise of the 35 (1996) 4 SCC 686 36 1993 Supp (4) SCC 136 H 684 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A powers conferred by Section 49 of the Supply Act. They came into effect from 20-10-1975. They were made applicable to all consumers availing supply of electricity from the Board. The Section in the Act does not require the Board to enter into a contract with individual consumer. Even in the absence of an individual contract, the Terms and Conditions of B Supply notified by the Board will be applicable to the consumer and he will be bound by them. Probably in to avoid any possible plea by the consumer that he had no knowledge of the Terms and Conditions of Supply, agreements in writing are entered into with each consumer. C That will not make the terms purely contractual. The Board in performance of a statutory duty supplied energy on certain specific terms and conditions framed in exercise of a statutory power. Undoubtedly the terms and conditions are statutory in character and they cannot be said to be purely contractual.” D (emphasis supplied) 72. The above discussion shows that Conditions of Supply were notified: first, by the Supply Licensee and Electricity Boards under Section 21 of 1910 Act; and second, by the Electricity Boards under Section 49 E of 1948 Act. The decision in Hyderabad Vanaspathi Ltd (supra) is illustrative of the fact that the courts have upheld the validity of the Conditions of Supply notified by the Electricity Boards. Significantly, the decision in Hyderabad Vanaspati Ltd. (supra) holds that the power of the Board to formulate terms and conditions under Section 49 of the 1948 Act is distinct from the power to make regulations embodied under F section 79 of the said Act. Therefore, the terms and conditions of supply notified by the Board under Section 49, although in the nature of subordinate legislation, were not required to be placed before the State Legislature under section 79A of the 1948 Act. In that case, it was also held that statutory conditions could be invalidated only if they were in G conflict with any provisions of the 1948 Act or the Constitution. 73. The auction-purchasers have referred to India Thermal Power Ltd v. State of MP37 to argue that the conditions of supply are not statutory, but form a part of the contract between the Electricity H 37 (2000) 3 SCC 379 K. C. NINAN v. KERALA STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD & 685 ORS. [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] Board and the consumer. Hence, it was submitted that these contractual A terms cannot be enforced by the Board against the new owner or occupier of the premises.
