The Section 4 notifications and the Section 6 declarations were issued on the following dates- Date of Section 4 Date of Section 6 Notification Notification 30.05.1991 11.05.1992 / 03.09.1992 14.01.1993 07.04.1994 04.03.1993 07.04.1994 b) Thereafter, the SLAO passed the awards for the acquired lands on different dates, whereby compensations were granted at the following rates- Date of SLAO award Compensation granted by SLAO (Rupees/acre) 8,000 for dry lands & 10,000 04.05.1983 for wet lands 18.11.1995 10,000 for dry lands & 15,000 for wet lands 01.01.1996 8,000 c) The rates of compensation awarded by the SLAO were enhanced by the Reference Court, keeping in view the year when the acquisition process commenced. The enhanced compensation amounts granted by the Reference Court was further enhanced, upon appeal, by the District Court. d) The dissatisfied landowners further approached the High Court for a higher compensation, which was subsequently granted vide the impugned judgements. The original rates of compensation awarded by the SLAO, the enhanced compensation amounts granted by the Reference Court, 668 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the compensation amounts as further enhanced by the District Court and impugned compensation amounts granted by the High Court, vide the impugned judgements, can be understood as follows- Amount Amount Amount Amount granted granted by granted granted by SLAO Reference by District by the (Rupees/ Court Court High Court acre) (Rupees/ (Rupees/ (Rupees/ acre) acre) acre) 8,000 for dry lands & 70,000 - 1,15,086 10,000 for wet lands 10,000 for 50,000 for 1,24,992 for dry lands & dry lands dry lands - 15,000 for 75,000 for 1,86,440 for wet lands wet lands wet lands 8,000 33,000 74,750/75,543 1,33,500 7.
