In Balaji (supra), this Court held that the beneficiary class under Article 15(4) must be both socially and educationally backward. Justice Gajendragadkar observed that caste, occupation and poverty are important factors for determining the socially backward class.204 This was reiterated in Janki Prasad Parimoo v. State of 204 MR Balaji v. State of Mysore, AIR 1963 SC 649 [24,25] [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1417 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. Jammu and Kashmir.205 Justice D G Palekar writing for this Court made a crucial observation on the relationship between social and educational backwardness. The learned Judge observed that though the phrases ‘socially’ and ‘educationally’ are used cumulatively for the purposes of identifying the backward class under Article 15(4), “if a class as a whole is educationally advanced it is generally also socially advanced because of the reformative effect of education on that class”.206 The relationship between social and educational backwardness where social backwardness contributes to educational backwardness was reiterated in Indra Sawhney (supra). Thus, though the criteria of socially and educationally backward class must be cumulatively read for the purposes of identifying the beneficiary class, they are not mutually exclusive concepts. They have a causal relationship, where the educational backwardness of a class is an impact of its social backwardness. 153. The next issue is whether the beneficiary classes in Article 15(4) and Article 16(4) are the same even though, unlike Article 15(4), Article 16(4) does not include the qualifiers of “social” and “educational”. In Janki Prasad Parimoo (supra), this Court read the requirement of social and educational backwardness into Article 16(4).207 This was reiterated in Vasant Kumar v. State of Karnataka208 by a Constitution Bench of this Court. However, in Indra Sawhney (supra), Justice B P Jeevan Reddy speaking for four Judges (Chief Justice Kania, Justice Venkatachaliah, Justice AM Ahmadi and himself) observed that there is no basis for this assumption. The learned Judge observed that Article 16(4) applies to a much larger class. The socially and educationally backward class is one of the categories, to which Article 16(4) applies. The socially and educationally backward classes are included within the broader class to which Article 16(4) applies. Justice Jeevan Reddy also held that reading educational backwardness in Article 16(4), which deals with reservation in appointments at any level, would not appropriate: 205 [1973] 3 SCR 236 : (1973) 1 SCC 420 206 (1973) 1 SCC 420 [24] 207 [1968] 2 SCR 786 208 [1985] Supp. 1 SCR 352 : (1985) Supp SCC 714; Justice Chinnappa Reddy observed that “backward classes of citizens referred to in Article 16(4), despite the short description, are the same as the socially and educationally backward classes of citizens and the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, so fully described in Article 15(4).” Justice Sen and Justice Venkataramiah (as the learned Chief Justice then was) observed that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are intended for the benefit of those who belong to casts, communities which are traditionally disfavored and which have suffered societal discrimination in the past.
