Corporation Bank, (2002) 6 SCC 33, and accordingly, placed similarly placed appeal(s) before a Constitution Bench of this Court vide an dated 30.10.2017,with a view to bring a sense of finality vis-à-vis the manner of operation of Section 13 of the Act (the “Constitution Bench”) . 2.9. Pertinently, the Constitution Bench vide its decision in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (P) Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 757 (hereinafter “New India Assurance 2”) categorically observed that the rigours of Section 13 of the Act needed to be complied with mandatorily; however, on account of various conflicting decision(s) of this Court, the Constitution Bench clarified that New India Assurance 2 (Supra) would operate prospectively. 2.10. Pertinently, during the pendency of New India Assurance 2 (Supra), a Division Bench of this Court in Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mampee Timbers & Hardwares (P) Ltd., (2021) 3 SCC 673 held that the consumer fora were permitted to accept written statements beyond the stipulated maximum 45 (forty- five) day period in an appropriate case on suitable terms. This position was followed by this Court pursuant to the New India Assurance 2 (Supra) in respect of application(s) seeking condonation of delay in filing the written statements/reply that either had been decided or were pending prior to 04.03.2020 i.e., the date of pronouncement of New India Assurance 2 (Supra).1 2.11. Despite the aforesaid, a divergent view came to be taken by a Division Bench of this Court in Daddy’s Builders (A) Ltd. v. Manisha Bhargava,(2021) 3 SCC 669 observed as under: “7. As observed by the National Commission that despite sufficient time granted the written statement 1 Refer: A. Suresh Kumar v. Amit Agarwal, (2021) 7 SCC 466; and Bhasin Infotech & Infrastructure (P) Ltd. v. Neema Agarwal, (2021) 18 SCC 301 774 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports was not filed within the prescribed period of limitation. Therefore, the National Commission has considered the aspect of condonation of delay on merits also. In any case, in view of the earlier decision of this Court in J.J. Merchant [J.J. Merchant v. Shrinath Chaturvedi, (2002) 6 SCC 635] and the subsequent authoritative decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (P) Ltd. [New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage(P) Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 757:(2020) 3 SCC(Civ) 338] , Consumer Fora have no jurisdiction and/or power to accept the written statement beyond the period of 45 days, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned [Daddy’s Builders (P) Ltd. v. Manisha Bhargava, 2020 SCC OnLine NCDRC 697] passed by the learned National Commission.” 2.12. In this context, a 3 Judge Bench of this Court in Diamond Exports v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd., (2022) 4 SCC 169 were tasked with inter alia reconciling and authoritatively settling the divergent views taken by this Court in respect of underlying complaint(s) either pending or instituted prior to 04.03.2020 i.e., the date of pronouncement of New India Assurance 2 (Supra).
