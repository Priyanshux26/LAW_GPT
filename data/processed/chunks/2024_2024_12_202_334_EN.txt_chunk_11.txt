Explanation 2 clarifies that they will proceed in terms of the unamended provision. The position dealt with by insertion of section 28(11) is distinct and that is about competence of the officer. The officers namely those from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence having been entrusted and assigned the functions as noted above, they are deemed to have been possessing the authority, whether in terms of section 28 unamended or amended and substituted as above. In these circumstances, for these additional reasons as well, the challenge to this sub-section must fail.” 10. Since the decision in Sunil Gupta (supra) was anterior in time, the same was relied upon by the Department before the High Court of Delhi during the hearing in Mangali Impex (supra). However, the High Court of Delhi did not agree with the view taken therein. 11. A batch of four statutory appeals came to be decided by this Court on 09.03.2021 in Canon India (supra) wherein this Court decided [2024] 12 S.C.R. 219 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. the following two issues – first, whether the officers of DRI would be “proper officers” under Section 2(34) for the purposes of Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 respectively; and second, whether such officers are empowered to issue show cause notices demanding customs duty under section 28 of the Act, 1962. To elaborate: (a) Whether the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had the legal authority to issue a show cause notice under Section 28(4) of the Act, 1962, when the goods were cleared for import by a Deputy Commissioner of Customs (who had decided that the goods are exempted from being taxed on import)? (b) Whether an Additional Director General of DRI, who has been appointed as an “officer of Customs” under the Notification dated 07.03.2002, has been entrusted with the functions of “the proper officer” for the purpose of Section 28 of the Act, 1962? 12. This Court while disposing of the aforesaid batch of matters proceeded to reiterate the principles laid down in Sayed Ali (supra) that only such officers who are vested with the power of assessment under Section 17 can be empowered to issue show cause notices under Section 28 or else this would result in a state of chaos and confusion. It also held that unless it is shown that the officers of DRI are at the first instance, customs officers under the Act, 1962 and are entrusted with the functions of a proper officer under Section 6 of the Act, 1962, they would not be competent to issue show-cause notices. It was held that, since no entrustment was made under Section 6 of the Act, 1962, the officers of DRI who were not otherwise officers of customs, could not have been assigned as the “proper officers”. 13. It also observed that from a conjoint reading of Section 2(34) and Section 28 respectively of the Act, 1962, it is manifest that only such a custom officer who has been assigned the specific functions of assessment and reassessment in the jurisdictional area where the import concerned has been affected, either by the Board or the Commissioner of Customs, in terms of Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962, was competent to issue notice under Section 28 of the Act, 1962.
