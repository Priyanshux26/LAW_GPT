This lack arises due to inadequate representation and participation of persons with disabilities in dominant discourse.98 65. Despite the history and the obsolescence of the medical model, humour is not universally denounced in the context of disability. It is now being increasingly used as a sophisticated literary medium for engagement with the society by persons with disabilities. It familiarises the society with the lived experiences of persons with disability, thereby dispelling prejudicial myths, and sensitising people.99 Challenging notions of ‘otherness’ or ‘inferiority’ associated with persons with disability, humour creates an equal space.100 Comics with disabilities use self-deprecating humour to critique the social and counter stereotypical images101. They bring stereotypes to the fore and rely on them in to dispel them.102 Humour is a reclamation of the public discourse by persons with disabilities who are pushing back against the dominant, ableist narratives around disability.103 66. We must therefore, distinguish ‘disabling humour’ that demeans and disparages persons with disability from ‘disability humour’ which challenges conventional wisdom about disability. While disability humour attempts to better understand and explain disability, disabling humour denigrates it.104 The two cannot be equated in their impact on dignity and on stereotypes about persons with disabilities105. com/doi/10.1177/0160597615621594 > 97 Mike Oliver, The social model of disability: Thirty years on, Disability & Society, 28(7), 1024-1026, <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2013.818773 > 98 Kinda Abujbarah (supra) [29] 99 ibid. 100 Bingham and Green (supra) [31] 101 Teresa Milbrodt, Today I Had an Eye Appointment, and I’m Still Blind”: Crip Humor, Storytelling, and Narrative Positioning of the Disabled Self, Disability Studies Quarterly, University of Missouri – Columbia Vol. 38 No. 2 (2018) < https://dsq-sds.org/index.php/dsq/article/view/6163/4902 > 102 Kinda Abujbarah (supra) [43] 103 Bingham and Green (supra) [3] 104 Bingham and Green (supra) for differences between theories of humour based on how they treat disability- the 105 See Robin Smith and Mara Shapon-Shevin, Disability Humor, Insults, and Inclusive Practice Social [2024] 7 S.C.R. 279 Nipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors. G. The Present Case 67. The appellant had invoked the writ jurisdiction of the High Court on the ground that the exercise of the second respondent’s fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression, contravened the appellant’s rights under Articles 14, 15 and 21 by reinforcement of stereotypes by the film. 68. Both these rights are fundamental rights under Article 19(1)(a) and Article 21 respectively. The High Court noted at paragraph 8 of the that since the appellant had not contested the second respondent’s claim that the overall message of the film was about resilience of persons with disability, the primary challenge that the film offended the sensibilities was not established. The countervailing right of freedom of speech and expression of the filmmaker as stated in the previous sections was not weighed against the rights claimed by the appellant. The High Court could have found that the two rights – the freedom of speech and expression of the filmmaker on the one hand and the rights of persons with disabilities need not be balanced because the rights in question (dignity, non-discrimination and equality) do not include the right to curb the filmmakers’ rights to exhibit a film duly certified for such exhibition106.
