It provides for the circumstances in which secondary evidence can be used when the original document is unavailable or inaccessible. It is imperative to adhere to the principles outlined in these sections, including the proper documentation and authentication, to successfully produce secondary evidence in legal proceedings. 33. After perusing various s of this Court, we can deduce the following principles relevant for examining the admissibility of secondary evidence: 33.1 Law requires the best evidence to be given fi rst, that is, primary evidence.15 33.2 Section 63 of the Evidence Act provides a list of the kinds of documents that can be produced as secondary evidence, which is admissible only in the absence of primary evidence.16 33.3 If the original document is available, it has to be produced and proved in the manner prescribed for primary evidence. So long as the best evidence is within the possession or can be produced or can be reached, no inferior proof could be given.17 33.4 A party must endeavor to adduce primary evidence of the contents, and only in exceptional cases will secondary evidence be admissible. The exceptions are designed to provide relief 15 Neeraj Dutta v. State (NCT of Delhi) (5-Judge Bench) (2023) 4 SCC 731;Yashoda v. K.

Still, there must be foundational evidence that the alleged copy is a true copy of the original.21 33.8 Before producing secondary evidence of the contents of a document, the non-production of the original must be accounted for in a manner that can bring it within one or other of the cases provided for in the section.22 33.9 Mere production and marking of a document as an exhibit by the Court cannot be held to be due proof of its contents.23It has to be proved in accordance with the law.24 34. A reading of Section 65(a) of the Evidence Act displays the following: a. Secondary evidence can be presented as a substitute when the original document/ primary evidence is in the possession of the opposing party or held by a third party; 18 M. Chandra v. M.
