However, while appointing an arbitrator following the agreed qualifications, the 67 UNCITRAL, 2012 Digest of Case Law on the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (2012) 59 68 Gary Born (supra) 1807 69 Fouchard, Gaillard and Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration (Emmanuel Gaillard and John Savage, eds. 1999) 453. 70 Article 2, Protocol on Arbitration Clauses signed on 24 September 1923 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2215 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company appointing court must also have due regard for considerations that are likely to secure an independent and impartial tribunal. Section 11(8) imposes a duty on the appointing court to ensure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator. 39. Section 11 is based on Article 11 of the Model Law. The draft text of the Model Law contained a provision which invalidated an arbitration agreement if it accorded a predominant position or unfair advantage to one party in the appointment of the arbitrator. The provision is extracted below: “An arbitration agreement is invalid [if] [to the extent that] it accords one of the parties a [predominant position] [manifestly unfair advantage] with regard to the appointment of arbitrators.”71 40. The Working Group decided to delete the above paragraph from the draft article based on the following reasoning: “90. The prevailing view, however, was to delete paragraph (2) since (a) there was no real need for such a rule in view of the fact that the few instances aimed at could appropriately be dealt with by other provisions of the model law (e.g., on challenge of arbitrator or setting aside of award); (b) the wording was too vague and could thus lead to controversy or dilatory tactics and, above all, to a misinterpretation which could endanger well-established and recognised appointment practices; (c) the legal sanction, in particular the idea of partial invalidity, was not sufficiently clear. 91. The Working Group, after deliberation, decided to delete paragraph (2). That decision, however, should not be understood as condoning practices where one party had a clearly greater influence on the appointment without good reasons.”72 (emphasis supplied) 71 A/CN.9/233 [17] 72 ibid 2216 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 41. The Working Group noted that other provisions in the Model Law such as Article 12 (challenge to an arbitrator) and Article 34 (setting aside of an arbitral award) implicitly restrict the autonomy of parties to appoint arbitrators.73 Thus, an arbitrator may be subject to challenge if the agreed procedure for appointment by the parties fails to adhere to the standards of independence and impartiality prescribed under Section 12. Gary Born also opines that the autonomy of parties to select arbitrators is generally subject to certain limitations, including mandatory requirements of equality and due process, impartiality and independence, and capacity requirements.74 iv. Independence and impartiality of arbitrators 42. Section 12 provides the grounds to challenge the appointment of arbitrators.75 Section 12(1) mandates that a person who has been approached to be appointed as an arbitrator must disclose in writing any circumstances that are likely to give rise to “justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality.” The Fifth Schedule to the Arbitration Act specifies circumstances that give rise to justifiable 73 Shahla Ali and Odysseas G Repousis, ‘Appointment of Arbitrators’ in UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (Ilian Bantekas, et al eds, 2020) 74 Gary Born, International Commercial Arbitration (3rd edn.,) 1783; Also see Michael Pryles, ‘Limits to Party Autonomy in Arbitral Procedure’ (2007) 24(3) Journal of International Arbitration 327-339.
