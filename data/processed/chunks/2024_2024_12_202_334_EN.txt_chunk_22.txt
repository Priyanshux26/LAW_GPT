236 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports iii. The decision in Mangali Impex (supra) is liable to be set aside and the decision in Sunil Gupta (supra) ought to be affirmed 43. He submitted that the decision in Mangali Impex (supra) too observed that the assignment of powers to DRI officers for issuing show cause notices under Section 28 of the Act, 1962 would create a situation of utter confusion and chaos and declared Section 28(11) of the Act, 1962 to be unconstitutional for being violative of Article 14 owing to its inherent arbitrariness. The decision also directed the Department to issue suitable instructions and ensure avoidance of multiplicity or plurality of proceedings. He submitted that the instructions have been scrupulously followed and complied with since 1999 through various notifications and Board circulars, thereby avoiding any overlap. He submitted that it was because of this reason that the importers were not able to produce any material to support such adverse inferences. Thus, he submitted that the decision in Mangali Impex (supra) also deserved to be set aside. 44. On the correctness of the decision in Mangali Impex (supra), he further submitted that the reasoning in the decision i.e., the Validation Act, 2011 does not extend its non-obstante clause to anything contained elsewhere in the same statute or in any other law for the time being in force, is incorrect and not legally unsustainable. On the finding of the High Court that since Explanation 2 remains on the statute even after the insertion of Section 28(11), it places an embargo for the period prior to 08.04.2011, for the application of Section 28(11). The Ld. ASG submitted that Explanation 2, in no way, had interfered or can interfere with the validating power introduced vide Section 28(11). He delineated the sequence of events leading to the insertion of Section 28(11) in the Act, 1962 to make good his submission. (i) This Court delivered the in Sayed Ali (supra) on 18.02.2011.
