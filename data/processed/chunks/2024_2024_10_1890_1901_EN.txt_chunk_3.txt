No.13937/2013 was filed pursuant to the dishonour of cheque No.955421 dated 24.12.2012 for a sum of Rs. 25 lakhs under similar circumstances. On appreciating the evidence the trial Court, as per a separate passed on 30.09.2023 itself arrived at similar conclusion as in C.C. No.13938/2013. 9. Based on the aforesaid conclusions, in both the cases the trial Court found the appellant guilty and accordingly convicted and sentenced, as per and dated 30.09.2023 as under: - “Accused is found guilty of the offence punishable U/Sec. 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act 1881. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1895 Bijay Agarwal v. M/s Medilines Acting U/sec. 255(2) of Cr.PC accused is hereby convicted for the offence punishable U/Sec. 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 and he is sentenced to pay to pay fine of Rs. 40,00,000/-. In default, accused shall undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months.” 10. Feeling aggrieved by the conviction and sentence passed in C.C. No.13937/2013, the appellant preferred Criminal Appeal No.1536/2023 and against the conviction and sentence passed in C.C. No.13938/2013 filed Criminal Appeal No.1537/2023, before the Principal City Civil and Sessions Judge Court at Bangalore. In the appeals, the appellant herein filed separate applications and sought for suspension of sentence passed in both the cases, under Section 389 of the Cr.PC. Separately, but on the very same lines s were passed in both the appeals on 10.11.2023. The sentence was suspended with condition to deposit 20% of the fine/compensation amount in each of the appeals. It is against the said direction to deposit 20% of the compensation amount that the appellant approached the High Court by filing Criminal Petition Nos.13095/2013 and 13153/2013 seeking that part of the dated 10.11.2023 requiring deposit of fine be quashed, which culminated in the impugned common dated 09.01.2024. 11. Now, the self-same appellant raised the contention in both the appeals that in the light of the decision of this Court in Shri Gurudatta Sugars Marketing Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Prithviraj Sayajirao Deshmukh & Ors.,1 he could not have been directed to pay any amount payable under Section 148 (1) of the NI Act, for this Court laid down the law that merely because an officer of a company being the authorised signatory of the cheque by itself would not make him its drawer. It is submitted that though the said decision was dealing with Section 143A of the NI Act in view of its analogicalness to Section 148, NI Act, the dictum laid down in the said decision is to be followed as relates Section 148 as well and hence, an authorized signatory of an accused company not being the drawer of the cheque could not be directed to deposit any particular percentage of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial Court under Section 148, NI Act. The learned counsel for the 1 [2024] 7 SCR 1211 : (2024) SCC OnLine SC 1800 1896 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports respondent resisted the contention and canvassed for the dismissal of the appeals.
