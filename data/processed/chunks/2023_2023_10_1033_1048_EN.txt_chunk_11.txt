P10 and P11). C 23. It will be relevant to refer to the following observations of this Court in the case of Sukhwant Singh v. State of Punjab3: “21. ………It hardly needs to be emphasised that in cases where injuries are caused by firearms, the opinion of the ballistic expert is of a considerable importance where both the firearm and the D crime cartridge are recovered during the investigation to connect an accused with the crime. Failure to produce the expert opinion before the trial court in such cases affects the creditworthiness of the prosecution case to a great extent.” 24. No doubt that this case has been recently distinguished by a E three-Judges Bench of this Court in the case of Gulab v. State of Uttar Pradesh4, relying on the earlier s of this Court in the cases of Gurucharan Singh v. State of Punjab5 and State of Punjab v. Jugraj Singh6. 25. However, it is to be noted that the case of Jugraj Singh (supra) was a case of direct evidence, where there was evidence of F two eye-witnesses. The present case is a case based on circumstantial evidence. In view of the serious doubt with regard to the credibility of the witnesses on the issue of extra-judicial confession and last seen theory, the failure to examine Ballistic Expert would, in our opinion, be a glaring defect in the prosecution case. We are, therefore, of the G considered view that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond 3 (1995) 3 SCC 367 4 (2022) 12 SCC 677 5 [1963] 3 SCR 585 6 (2002) 3 SCC 234 H 1048 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A reasonable doubt and, as such, the accused are entitled to benefit of doubt. 26. In the result, the appeals are allowed. The impugned and of the High Court dated 4th February 2010 and the of the Trial Court dated 10th July 2001 are quashed and set aside. B 27. The bail bonds of the appellants shall stand discharged. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed. Divya Pandey Appeals allowed. (Assisted by : Roopanshi Virang, LCRA) C D E F G H
