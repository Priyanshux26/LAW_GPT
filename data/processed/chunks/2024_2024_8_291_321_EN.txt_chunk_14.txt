The law laid down in Forasol (supra) has also been used in other cases though they do not pertain to arbitration but involved an issue of a debt expressed in foreign currency that required to be converted to Indian rupee. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Kantika Colour Lab43 involved a consumer complaint for payment of an insurance claim due to the damage of a printer in transit. This Court did not cite Forasol (supra) but used the date of its as the proper date for conversion of the cost of the printer that was expressed in Singaporean dollars. In Meenakshi Saxena v. ECGC Limited,44 again was a consumer complaint for payment under an insurance contract for loss suffered during export of goods, the Court noted 40 Renusagar (supra), see paras 131-133. 41 ibid, paras 107-108. 42 [2010] 6 SCR 204 : ibid, para 133. 43 [2010] 6 SCR 204 : (2010) 6 SCC 449 44 [2018] 5 SCR 421 : (2018) 7 SCC 479 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 309 DLF Ltd. (Formerly Known as DLF Universal Ltd) and Anr. v. Koncar Generators and Motors Ltd. that the contract provided for a date on which the exchange rate must be determined and followed Forasol (supra) to hold that this is the proper date. 7.1 In certain other cases, the principle in Forasol (supra) has been considered but not applied due to the peculiar facts of those cases. For example, in cases of motor accident deaths where the deceased was earning in foreign currency, the Court has refused to use the date of the as the proper date and has instead used the date of filing the claim as the claims in these cases were filed in Indian rupee and the Tribunal also decided the cases in Indian rupee. Hence, it was held that the amount already stood converted in the claim itself.45 Similarly, in Triveny Kodkany v. Air India Limited 46 involving claim for compensation due to the death of an airline passenger, the Court considered Forasol (supra) and Renusagar (supra) but did not apply them. It differentiated the facts in those cases as in both of them, the award holders were foreign companies. However, in this case, the claimants seeking compensation were residing in India. Further, like in motor accident cases, it found that the claim for payment was itself in Indian rupees and interest was also provided on such amount. Hence, it found that the date of filing the complaint is the proper date for conversion. 8. It is therefore clear from the above-referred analysis of judicial determinations that the principle and law laid down in Forasol (supra) has been widely considered and followed by this Court in various types of matters. There is no impediment for us to apply this decision to cases under the 1996 Act, even though it was decided under the Arbitration Act, 1940. We therefore disagree with the High Court that Forasol (supra) does not apply to cases under the 1996 Act. 9. The Delhi High Court has also relied on Forasol (supra) in several cases on the enforcement of domestic and foreign arbitral awards where the amount is expressed in foreign currency: 45 See United India Insurance Co. Ltd v. Patricia Jean Mahajan (2002) 6 SCC 281; Jiju Kuruvila v. Kunjujamma Mohan (2013) 9 SCC 166.
