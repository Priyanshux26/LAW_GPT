[2023] 6 S.C.R. 259 259 CCE, AURANGABAD A v. M/S VIDEOCON INDUSTRIES LTD. THR. ITS DIRECTOR (Civil Appeal No. 5622 of 2009) MARCH 29, 2023 B [S. RAVINDRA BHAT AND DIPANKAR DATTA, JJ.] Customs Tariff Act, 1975 – First Schedule – Chapter 90 – LCD panels – Classification of – CESTAT held that the LCD panels imported by assesses were classifiable in Chapter Heading C 9013.8010 of the First Schedule to the 1975 Act – Held: Reasoning and conclusion of CESTAT that the LCD sets were classifiable under Chapter 90, Entry 9013.8010, is sound and unexceptionable. Customs Tariff Act, 1975 – First Schedule – Section XVI, XVII – Chapters 85 and 90 – General Interpretive Rules and Notes – D Plea of revenue that by virtue of Note 2 (b) to Chapter 85, the goods are to be classified based on their principal or sole use – Held: Revenue’s argument jumps over interpretive instructions – In the present case, Note 1 (m) along with the General Note 3 (a) [of the General Rules of Interpretation] that headings that are specifically provided should be preferred over the general ones, is E decisive – Thus, the aforesaid contention of revenue is insubstantial because of the clear mandate of Note 1 (m) to Chapter 85 which excludes Chapter 90 goods (which includes LCD panels) – When goods are excluded from a particular chapter, the “pull in” through a note has to be narrowly construed, as otherwise, the basis of F exclusion would be defeated, and the earlier note (of exclusion) rendered redundant – Secure Meters case is decisive on the question that LCDs are not articles provided “more specifically in other headings”, i.e., other than 90.13 – Furthermore, the fact that LCDs could be used for purposes other than television sets or audio sets is also concluded because in the said decision its use in meters was G in issue – Tax/Taxation. Dismissing the appeals, the Court HELD: 1.1 On a reading of the General Interpretive rules and the notes to the concerned chapters (85 and 90, in the present H 259 260 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A case), it is evident that: (a) classification has to be in accord with “the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes” (Note 1) (b) Reference in a heading to “an article” includes “that article incomplete or unfinished” provided, such incomplete or unfinished article has “the essential character of the complete or finished article.” [Note 2(a)] (c) If on an application of Rule B 2(a), an article is classifiable in more than one heading “the heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description.” [Note 3 (a)] [Para 22][273-B-D] 1.2 Note 1 (m) to Chapter 85 excludes “(m) Articles of C Chapter 90…” The revenue relies on Note 2 (b) to Chapter 85, which says “other parts and accessories, “if suitable for use solely or principally with a particular kind of machine, instrument or apparatus, or with a number of machines, instruments or apparatus of the same heading” and then enumerates heading 9013, to say D that Chapter 85 would cover the present case.
