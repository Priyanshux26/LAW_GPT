In fact, the statement of the Member (Judicial) would seem to indicate that no mentioning is permitted at all before the declaration of as a consequence of which the was delivered without hearing any counsel on the passed by this Court. Likewise, the statement of the Member (Technical) indicates that while some lawyers had attempted to intervene, the Presiding Offi cer had not permitted such an intervention and had proceeded to pass the . The matter does not rest there. 20 On 16 October 2023, the Bench of the NCLAT passed an recording that the Registry of the Tribunal had brought to its notice an email dated 13 October 2023 issued at 5.35 pm enclosing a copy of the dated 13 October 2023 passed by this Court. The NCLAT has stated that after the was produced, it had perused it and noticed that this Court had issued directions to the 103 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. eff ect that in the pending appeal shall be delivered by NCLAT after it is duly apprised of the fact that the result of the AGM is being declared. The NCLAT has proceeded to pass an for suspending the which it pronounced on 13 October 2023. 21 We are constrained to observe that the dated 16 October 2023 purports to create an impression that the Bench of the NCLAT was apprised of the passed by this Court for the fi rst time when the email was received at 5.35 pm on 13 October 2023. This prima facie is a falsehood since it has emerged before this Court, both on the statements of the counsel as well as on affi davit that the Bench of the NCLAT was duly apprised of the passed by this Court on 13 October 2023 in the morning session when the appeal was taken up at around 2.15 pm for pronouncement of . 22 We are, therefore, prima facie, of the view that the Members of the NCLAT have (i) failed to disclose facts to the Chairperson of the NCLAT who was under a duty to carry out an enquiry in pursuance of the judicial passed by this Court; and (ii) incorrectly sought to create a record in the dated 16 October 2023 that the of this Court was drawn to the notice of the Bench only at 5.35 pm on 13 October 2023. 23 We will deal with the consequential steps which should be taken by this Court and the action which has to be adopted in pursuance of what has transpired in these proceedings. 24 The manner in which the NCLAT has proceeded to deliver in defi ance of the directions of the Court is unbecoming of a judicial tribunal. NCLAT is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court. It was duty bound to comply with the of this Court. It was apprised of the fact that this Court had passed an in the morning session on 13 October 2023 to the eff ect that it shall proceed to declare after being apprised of the results of the AGM.
