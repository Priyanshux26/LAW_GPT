Correspondingly, it also places a duty on the public authorities to act in a responsible and transparent manner by providing information about their functioning to the citizens.8 In the process, the legislation promotes the ideals of open government and democracy.9 Democracy requires an informed citizenry and transparency in functioning for the electors to hold the elected representatives to account.10 Thus, the right to information promotes the values of participative democracy and accountability. 17.

Union of India14 observed that the CIC and SICs have a prominent place under the RTI Act and they must exercise their powers and functions keeping in mind the purpose and object of the legislation. 18.
