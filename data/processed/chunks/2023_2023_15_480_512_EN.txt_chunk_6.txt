These statements are hearsay and do not in any manner implicate or connect the appellant – Manish Sisodia with the transfer and use of the proceeds of the crime.  The statements of co-accused or other witnesses relied upon by the DoE were extracted and forced by a threat of arrest, as in the case of Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, Butchi Babu and Manoj Rai. Some of the co-accused like Arun Pillai and Sameer Mahendru have retracted from their statements.  Raghav Magunta, son of a Member of Parliament of the ruling party in Andhra Pradesh, was forced to make the statement dated 27.07.2023, which is contrary to his earlier statement dated 16.09.2022.  Statements obtained from Dinesh Arora, an approver, is weak evidence and in this regard, reliance is placed upon Ravinder Singh v. State of Haryana13.  Statement of Dinesh Arora dated 12.07.2023 is contrary to his earlier statement made on 09.04.2023.  Allegations regarding the appellant – Manish Sisodia’s involvement in the grant of licence to Indo Spirit is make belief and a false assertion. Statements obtained from the offi cers of the Excise Department under Section 164 of the Code,namely, 13 (1975) 3 SCC 742. 490 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Suman, Sachin Solanki and Arava Gopi Krishna do not implicate the appellant – Manish Sisodia.  The appellant – Manish Sisodia, in his statement dated 14.03.2023, has stated that he had not instructed the Excise Commissioner to expedite the clearance of Indo Spirit’s license.  Interaction and communications between the private parties viz. business of Indo Spirit was independent, and without any interference, knowledge and participation of the appellant – Manish Sisodia.  Vijay Nair was not associated with the appellant – Manish Sisodia. There are also contradictions in the statements made by C. Arvind, under Section 50 of the PMLA, dated 07.12.2022, and the one under Section 164 of Cr.P.C., dated 16.02.2023.  Allegation regarding destruction of the cabinet fi le is nothing but making a mountain out of a molehill. The three legal opinions, two by former Chief Justices of India and one by a Law Offi cer, on merits or demerits of the old policy, were benign, and of no consequence and relevance. The allegation is also contrary to the contemporaneous records maintained by DoE. 7. The CBI and DoE have submitted as under:  Under the old excise policy: o There was no concept of private wholesaler and no concept of zones.14 o The distributor/wholesaler was entitled to 5% profi t margin. o The retail trade was primarily undertaken by four corporations of the Government of NCT of Delhi.  R.D. Committee Report dated 13.10.202015 recommended: o Gradual withdrawal of government presence. 14 As per the appellant–Manish Sisodia, under the old liquor policy there were private whole-sellers, which assertion prima-facie appears to be correct. 15 The Expert Committee headed by Ravi Dhawan was constituted on 04.09.2020. MANISH SISODIA v. CENTRAL BUREAU OF 491 INVESTIGATION [SANJIV KHANNA, J.] o Wholesale operation under one government entity.
