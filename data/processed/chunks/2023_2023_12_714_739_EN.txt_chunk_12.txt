18. Viewed in this context, the remand dated 15.06.2023 passed by the learned Vacation Judge/Additional Sessions Judge, Panchkula, refl ects total failure on his part in discharging his duty as per the expected standard. The learned Judge did not even record a fi nding that he perused the grounds of arrest to ascertain whether the ED had recorded reasons to believe that the appellants were guilty of an off ence under the Act of 2002 and that there was proper compliance with the mandate of Section 19 of the Act of 2002. He merely stated that, keeping in view the seriousness of the off ences and the stage of the investigation, he was convinced that custodial interrogation of the accused persons was required in the present case and remanded them to the custody of the ED! The sentence – ‘It is further (sic) that all the necessary mandates of law have been complied with’ follows – ‘It is the case of the prosecution….’ and appears to be a continuation thereof, as indicated by the word ‘further’, and is not a recording by the learned Judge of his own satisfaction to that eff ect. 19. In consequence, it would be necessary for us to examine how the appellants were arrested and verify whether it was in keeping with the safeguards in Section 19 of the Act of 2002. In this context, the sequence 3 (1969) 1 SCC 292 730 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. of events makes for an interesting reading. The fi rst ECIR was registered by the ED on 15.06.2021 and Roop Bansal was arrested in connection therewith on 08.06.2023. Neither of the appellants was shown as an accused therein. However, it is the case of the ED that investigation in relation to the fi rst ECIR is still ongoing. In any event, after the arrest of Roop Bansal, both the appellants secured interim protection by way of anticipatory bail on 09.06.2023, albeit till the next day of hearing, viz., 05.07.2023, from the Delhi High Court. However, both the appellants were summoned on 14.06.2023 for interrogation in connection with the fi rst ECIR, in which they had interim protection. Summons in that regard were served upon them on 13.06.2023 at 06.15 pm. Signifi cantly, the second ECIR was recorded only on that day, i.e., on 13.06.2023, in connection with FIR No. 0006 which was registered on 17.04.2023. Therein also, neither of the appellants was shown as an accused and it was only Roop Bansal who stood named as an accused. In compliance with the summons received by them vis-à-vis the fi rst ECIR, both the appellants presented themselves at the ED’s offi ce at Rajokri, New Delhi, at 11.00 am on 14.06.2023. While they were there, Pankaj Bansal was served with summons at 04.52 pm, requiring him to appear before another Investigating Offi cer at 05.00 pm in relation to the second ECIR. As already noted, there is ambiguity as to when Basant Bansal was served with such summons.
