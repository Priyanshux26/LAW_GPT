Thereafter, the Inspector of Police, Ichapuram Circle G (PW-27), took up further investigation. He visited the scene of offence, examined witnesses and recorded their statements. After completion of the investigation, he filed a charge sheet against the accused. Charges were framed against them under Sections 302, 379, 394 r/w 397, 411 and 450 IPC. They pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. H 890 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 4. During the trial, the prosecution examined 27 witnesses and marked Exs.P-1 to P-21 in evidence, apart from producing Material Objects (MOs) 1 to 99. The accused did not adduce evidence but were examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C. Upon considering the evidence and the MOs, the learned VI Additional District and Sessions Judge, Sompeta, held the accused guilty of the offences punishable under Sections 302, B 397 and 450 IPC. They were sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life under Section 302 IPC and to pay fine of ¹ 2,000/- each; imprisonment for a period of 10 years under Section 450 IPC and to pay a fine of ¹ 2,000/- each; and imprisonment for 7 years under Section 397 IPC. Further imprisonment was directed for default in payment of fines. C 5. Aggrieved thereby, the accused filed Criminal Appeal No. 915 of 2016 before the High Court. By dated 03.10.2018, a Division Bench of the High Court opined that the circumstantial evidence, in corroboration with the medical evidence, the weapons used and the manner in which the attack was made, established that the accused D intended to cause the death of the inmates of the house of PW-1, fulfilling the essential ingredients of the offence under Section 300 IPC, punishable under Section 302 IPC. The High Court, therefore, concluded that there was no merit in the case and dismissed the same. Hence, this appeal by special leave under Article 136 of the Constitution. E 6. At the outset, it would be apposite to note the scope of jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution in a case of this nature, where the Trial Court and the High Court have concurrently returned findings of guilt against the accused. In Pappu Vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh [(2022) 10 SCC 321], this Court pointed out that, in an appeal by special leave under Article 136 of the Constitution against concurrent findings F of fact by the Trial Court and the High Court after appreciation of evidence, each and every finding of fact cannot be contested and such an appeal cannot be dealt with as if this Court is another forum for reappreciation of evidence. It was observed that it is only if the assessment by the Trial Court and the High Court can be said to be G vitiated by any error of law or procedure or misreading of evidence or in disregard to the norms of judicial process, leading to serious prejudice or injustice, that this Court may, and in appropriate cases would, interfere in to prevent grave or serious miscarriage of justice, but such a course is to be adopted only in rare and exceptional cases of manifest illegality.
