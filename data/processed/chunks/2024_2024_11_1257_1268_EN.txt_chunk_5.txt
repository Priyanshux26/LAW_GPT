(v). Burden of Proof Lies on Defendants: Since the appellants did not deny the respondents’ title, the burden was on the appellants to prove that they had become owners by adverse possession. The appellants failed to discharge this burden. The Trial Court correctly found that the appellants’ possession, if any, began in 1980 and was insufficient to establish adverse possession. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1265 The State of Haryana & Anr. v. Amin Lal (Since Deceased) Through His Lrs & Ors. 7. Having heard the arguments advanced by both parties and perused the records, the core issue before us is whether the High Court was correct in setting aside the of the First Appellate Court and restoring the decree passed by the Trial Court in favour of the respondents (plaintiffs). The appellants challenge the High Court’s decision on several grounds, which we shall address in their turn. 8. The appellants contention that plaintiff failed to prove their title and ownership is completely misplaced for the reasons and analysis made hereunder: 8.1 We find this argument unconvincing for several reasons: In their written statement before the Trial Court, the appellants did not specifically deny the plaintiffs’ ownership of the suit property. Instead, they primarily relied on the plea of adverse possession. Under VIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, allegations of fact not denied specifically are deemed to be admitted. By asserting adverse possession, the appellants have impliedly admitted the plaintiffs’ title. 8.2 The plaintiffs relied on jamabandi entries to establish their ownership. The jamabandi for the year 1969-70 (Exhibit P1) records the name of Shri Amin Lal as owner to the extent of half share. Revenue records are public documents maintained by government officials in the regular course of duties and carry a presumption of correctness under Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. While it is true that revenue entries do not by themselves confer title, they are admissible as evidence of possession and can support a claim of ownership when corroborated by other evidence. 8.3 The respondents have produced copies of registered sale deeds and mutation records before this Court, which were part of the additional documents filed with the counter-affidavit. Plaintiff No. 1, Shri Amin Lal, derived title through a registered sale deed dated 5th July 1960, and mutation No. 8329 was sanctioned on 20th April 1982. Plaintiff No. 2, Shri Ashok Kumar, derived his title through a registered sale deed dated 12th March 1973, and mutation No. 8330 was sanctioned on 20th April 1982. These documents establish a chain of title and cannot be ignored. 1266 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 8.4 The appellants did not dispute the plaintiffs’ title in their pleadings or during the trial. The First Appellate Court’s finding that the plaintiffs are not the true owners is based on conjecture and lacks evidentiary support. The appellants cannot now, at this appellate stage, challenge the plaintiffs’ ownership without having raised a specific denial earlier. 9. The appellants’ next submission that the burden of proof lay on the plaintiffs to establish their title is equally not borne out from the records.
