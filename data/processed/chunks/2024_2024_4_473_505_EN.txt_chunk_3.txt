Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. for providing metro rail connectivity between New Delhi Railway Station and the Indira Gandhi International Airport and other points within Delhi. 3. Under the 2008 Agreement, DAMEPL was granted exclusive rights, license and authority to implement the project and concession in respect of AMEL. This included the right to manage and operate the Project as a commercial enterprise. DMRC was to undertake clearances and bear costs relating to land acquisition, and civil structures, while DAMEPL was to undertake among other things, the design, supply, installation, testing and commissioning of railway systems. DAMEPL was to complete the work in two years, and thereafter, to maintain AMEL until August 2038. 4. In April 2012, DAMEPL sought a deferment of the concession fee, citing delays in providing access to the stations by DMRC. DAMEPL stated that while AMEL had been running without a glitch since 23 February 2011, the retail activity had not picked pace. DAMEPL urged DMRC to extend their support, to this first-of-its-kind public- private partnership by deferring the concession fee payable by DAMEPL. 5. There was an exchange of correspondence between the parties which ultimately led the Ministry of Urban Development to convene a meeting of stakeholders in July 2012. A Joint Inspection Committee was set up to inspect the defects alleged by DAMEPL. 6. Meanwhile, DAMEPL expressed its intention to halt operations, alleging that the line was unsafe to operate.
