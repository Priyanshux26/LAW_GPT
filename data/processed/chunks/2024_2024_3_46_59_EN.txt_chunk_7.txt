19. Strangely enough, there is somersault in the stand taken by defendant No. 1. It is for the reason that earlier the plaintiffs and defendant No. 1 were stated to be at loggerheads as lot of allegations had been made by the plaintiffs in the plaint, such as playing cards, drinking [2024] 3 S.C.R. 57 Srinivas Raghavendrarao Desai (Dead) By Lrs. v. V. Kumar Vamanrao @ Alok and Ors. etc. It is for that reason that the suit for partition was filed during the life time of the defendant No. 1. However, now they have joined hands. As a result, defendant No. 1 before this Court is now seeking to support the case of the plaintiffs. Such conduct of the parties, like a pendulum in the clock in fact puts the Court on trial. 20. If the contents of partition dated 30.08.1984 are perused, the property bearing Regular Survey No. 106/2 goes to the share of the appellant. Even otherwise, the property in question, namely, Regular Survey No. 106/2, on which the plaintiffs and defendant No. 1 are now staking claim was sold by defendant No. 7 to defendant No. 9 vide registered sale deed dated 25.07.2001. It was well within the knowledge of defendant No. 1. The Trial Court categorically recorded that even if the signatures on the sale deed were effected by defendant No. 7, stated to be executed on behalf of defendant No. 1, but still defendant No. 1 did not object to the same and in fact supported the stand of defendant No. 7 as the property in question had gone to his share in the family partition. Further, if defendant No. 1 was the true owner of the property in question and had any objection to the aforesaid sale transaction, during his life time he never challenged the same despite being in knowledge thereof. This also establishes that in fact in 1984 partition, the property had gone to the share of defendant No. 7. The partition deed dated 30.08.1984 between Vyasrao Hanamanthrao Desai and Raghavendrarao Hanamanthrao Desai, whose descendants are litigating with reference to their respective shares is extracted below: “The portion of the property belonging to Sri Vyasrao Hanamanthrao Desai and Late Capt.
