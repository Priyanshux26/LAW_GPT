15. Mr Pallav Mongia, learned advocate on behalf of the interveners in IA No. 58168 of 2023, submitted that Section 2(1)(h) of the Arbitration Act does not restrict the defi nition of parties to “signatories”. Rather, the defi nition has to be inferred from Section 7. Section 7(4) expands the defi nition of parties to non-signatories. 16. Ms Meenakshi Arora, learned senior counsel on behalf of the respondent in SLP (C) No. 8607 of 2022, argued for de-tagging of SLP (C) No. 8607 of 2022 from the lead matter, that is Arbitration Petition No. 38 of 2020, as the former deals with power of the courts to issue directions under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act against third parties. Further, the learned senior counsel submitted that the courts can take aid of the group of companies doctrine to issue interim directions against non-signatories to the arbitration agreement.

This Bench will address the issues arising out of the of reference as well as the above-mentioned ancillary issues in due course. C. Legal background i. India 18. Before the enactment of the Arbitration Act, the law on arbitration was substantially contained in the Arbitration Act of 1940,9 the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act of 1937, and the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act of 1961. In 1978, the Law Commission of India suggested substantive amendments to the 1940 Act. Moreover, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law10 adopted the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration in 1985.11 The General Assembly of the United Nations recommended all the Member States to adopt the UNCITRAL Model Law in their domestic legislation with a view to uniformize the law of arbitral procedures.12 The Arbitration Act was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to arbitration. It brought the law relating to domestic and international commercial arbitration in consonance with the UNCITRAL Model Law, the New York Convention, and the Geneva Convention. 19.
