Pertinently, the respondent did not press for the said application by submitting a memo on 02.12.2014 and stating therein that the Court may proceed to frame charge against him. The said memo reads as under- “IN THE COURT OF THE PRINCIPAL DISTRICT AND SESSIONS JUDGE BANGALORE RURAL AT BANGALORE Spl.C.C. No.488 of 11 BETWEEN: State by Lokayktha Police, Bangalore Rural. ... Complainant AND: Subbegowda. … Accused 24 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R.

It is further submitted that the Hon’ble Court may proceed to frame charges against the Accused. 02.12.2014 Bangalore. Sd/- Advocate for Accused.” 5.The trial court thereafter framed the charge against the respondent- accused on 23.12.2014 for the off ence of criminal misconduct under Section 13(1)(e) punishable under Section 13(2) of the said Act in Special Case No. 488 of 2011. The prosecution thereafter examined as many as 17 witnesses in support of its case, and in the midst of the trial the respondent-accused again fi led third application under Section 227 of CrPC seeking his discharge from the case on the ground that the respondent was an employee of the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board and could be removed only by the said Board in view of Rule 10 of Karnataka Civil Services (Classifi cation, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1957. The State Government therefore had no jurisdiction to accord the sanction to prosecute the respondent under Section 19(1) of the said Act. The trial court vide the dated 05.06.2018 dismissed the said application by passing a detailed holding, inter alia, that the third successive application fi led by the respondent-accused for the discharge from the case, when the evidence of 17 witnesses had been recorded and when the contention based on the sanction was already rejected by the Court earlier, was liable to be dismissed.

SUBBEGOWDA [BELA M. TRIVEDI, J.] submitting the Memo dated 02.12.2014 and despite the fact that after framing of the charge by the Special Court on 23.12.2014, the trial had proceeded further and the prosecution had examined 17 witnesses in support of its case? (ii) Whether the High Court in the criminal petition fi led under Section 482 of the CrPC could reverse the fi ndings recorded by the Special Court with regard to the validity of sanction, ignoring the bar contained in sub-section (3) read with sub-section (4) of Section 19 of the said Act?
