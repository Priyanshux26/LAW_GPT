Applying the aforementioned principles to the present case, we find ourselves in agreement with the finding of the E High Court that the appellant’s cause of action in respect of Arbitration Applications Nos. 25/2003 and 27/2003, relating to the work s dated 7-10-1979 and 4-4-1980 arose on 8-2-1983, which is when the final bill handed over to the respondent became due. Mere correspondence of the appellant by way of writing letters/reminders to the respondent F subsequent to this date would not extend the time of limitation. Hence the maximum period during which this Court could have allowed the appellant’s application for appointment of an arbitrator is 3 years from the date on which cause of action arose i.e. 8-2-1986. Similarly, with respect to Arbitration G Application No. 28/2003 relating to the work dated 3- 5-1985, the respondent has stated that final bill was handed over and became due on 10-8-1989. This has not been disputed by the appellant. Hence the limitation period ended on 10-8-1992. Since the appellant served notice for appointment of arbitrator in 2002, and requested the H 624 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A appointment of an arbitrator before a court only by the end of 2003, his claim is clearly barred by limitation.” (Emphasis supplied) 46. Relying on the observations made in para 21 referred to above, the submission canvassed on behalf of the respondent is that para 28 of B Geo Miller (supra) may be applicable in a given set of facts where there is subsisting/continuing cause of action. However, in the present case, the Liquidated Damages were deducted by encashment of bank guarantee. This was a positive action on the part of the respondent, crystalising the rights/cause of action and the same should not be C interpreted as a continuing cause of action. 47. In Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Another v. Nortel Networks India Private Limited, reported in (2021) 5 SCC 738, this Court undertook a comprehensive analysis of the relevant provisions and held that in cases where claims are ex facie time barred, the Court may refuse to make reference under Section 11 of the Act 1996. This D decision assumes importance and we should look into the same in little details. The appellant BSNL issued a tender notification inviting bids for planning, engineering, supply, insulation, testing and commissioning of GSM based cellular mobile network in the Southern region. The respondent company was awarded the purchase . On completion E of the project, the appellant withheld an amount of Rs. 99.70 crore towards the liquidated damages and other levies. The respondent raised a claim on 13.05.2014 for payment of the above said amount from the appellant who rejected the claim on 04.08.2014. F The respondent, after a period of over 5.5 years invoked the arbitration clause and requested for the appointment of an independent arbitrator on 29.04.2020. It was also contended that the dispute of withholding the said amount, would fall within the ambit of arbitrable disputes under the agreement. The appellant on 09.06.2020 replied that G the request for appointment of an arbitrator could not be entertained since the case had already been closed and the notice invoking arbitration was time barred.
