IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 361 [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] 93. The Petitioners have contended that this is invalid, as Article 367(4) (c) of the Constitution of India read with Section 35 of the Constitution of the State required the Governor to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the State. At the outset, Constitutional s have been issued in the past during President’s Rule. In 1989, the State of Jammu and Kashmir was under Governor’s Rule, and C.O. 136117 was issued. The Solicitor General also drew our attention to other Constitutional s 151,118 154,119 160120 and 162121 issued during the President’s Rule, which extended the period of President’s Rule from three years to six years. 94. Notwithstanding these illustrations, I fi nd that the concurrence of the Union Government can substitute the concurrence of the Government of the State in this case, since, as discussed above, the President has unilateral power to notify that Article 370 ceases to exist under Article 370(3), which, in eff ect, amounts to applying all provisions of the Constitution under Article 370(1)(d). Therefore, there was no requirement to obtain concurrence of the Government of the State in applying all provisions of the Constitution under C.O. 272. 4. Whether the exercise of power under Article 356 was permissible while issuing COs 272 and 273. A. Article 356 can be imposed once the Legislative Assembly had been dissolved: 95. The imposition of the Governor’s rule under Section 92 of the Jammu & Kashmir Constitution on 20.6.2018 was a direct result of the failure of the constitutional machinery of the State. This is, however, not a matter 117 The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Amendment , 1989. 118 The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Amendment , 1993. 119 The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Amendment , 1994. 120 The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Amendment , 1995. 121 The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Amendment , 1996. 362 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. of challenge in the present proceedings. On the Legislative Assembly being dissolved during the Governor’s rule on 21.11.2018, the status quo position continued as prior to it, and on 28.11.2018, the Governor submitted a report to the President regarding the imposition of emergency under Article 356. The President’s rule was, thus, imposed. The imposition of the President’s rule took place as Section 92 of the Jammu & Kashmir Constitution limited the Governor’s rule to six months without any scope to extend it, and there is nothing on record to show that any political party was willing to stake claim to form the Government during this period. There was a belated challenge to the imposition of the Central rule. 96. The consequence of the imposition of the President’s rule was that the President assumed the power of the State Government under the Indian Constitution. This imposition was predicated on the failure of the constitutional machinery, which really took place prior to the Governor’s rule.
