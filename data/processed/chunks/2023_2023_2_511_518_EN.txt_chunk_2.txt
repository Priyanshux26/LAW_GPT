Rajmangal Kumar, Satyendra Kumar, Ms. Preeja Nair, Ali Mushtaq Navazish, Rajeev Singh, Advs. for the Petitioners. Chirag M. Shroff, Adv. for the Respondent. H 514 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A The of the Court was delivered by SANJAY KUMAR, J. 1. By way of these transfer petitions filed under Section 406 Cr.P.C., Yogesh Upadhyay and his proprietary concern, M/s. Shakti Buildcon, seek transfer of SCC Nos.25668/2019 and 26875/2019, both B titled ‘Atlanta Limited Vs. M/s Shakti Buildcon & Anr.’, pending before the learned 22nd Jt. Civil Judge, Senior Division, Nagpur, and the learned 20th Civil Judge, Senior Division, Nagpur, respectively, to the South West District Courts, Dwarka, New Delhi, to be tried along with Complaint Case Nos. 42489/2019, 1464/2020, 7596/2020 and 4094/2020, all titled C ‘Atlanta Limited Vs. Yogesh Upadhyay’. These six complaint cases were filed against the petitioners by Atlanta Limited, the respondent herein, under Sections 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 [for short, ‘the Act of 1881’]. 2. The six cheques, which are the subject-matter of these complaint cases, were issued by the petitioners in connection with purchase of a D NAWA-make crusher plant from the respondent company for a sum of `.1,88,80,000/-, under Agreement dated 04.06.2019. This sale consideration was to be paid in seven installments by way of cheques. The first cheque issued by the petitioners for a sum of `.11,80,000/- was duly honoured upon presentation by the respondent company. The E remaining six cheques, however, were dishonoured on the strength of ‘Stop payment’ instructions. The first two cheques that came to be dishonoured were presented by the respondent company through its bank at Nagpur, Maharashtra. The first two complaint cases were accordingly filed before the Courts at Nagpur, Maharashtra. The remaining four cheques were thereafter presented by the respondent company through F its bank at New Delhi and in consequence, those complaint cases were filed before the Dwarka Courts, New Delhi. 3. Mr. Rajmangal Kumar, learned counsel, appearing for the petitioners, would contend that as all the cheques relate to the same transaction, it would be proper and appropriate that the cases pertaining G to their dishonour are tried and decided together. He would rely on case law to support his contention. 4. On the other hand, Mr. Chirag M. Shroff, learned counsel for the respondent company, would contend that Section 142 of the Act of 1881 would override Section 406 Cr.P.C., in view of the non obstante H YOGESH UPADHYAY AND ANR.v. ATLANTA LIMITED 515 [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] clause therein, and that the two cases filed at Nagpur, Maharashtra, A therefore cannot be transferred. Further, he would assert that Section 142(2) of the Act of 1881 confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the Courts at Nagpur in so far as the first two complaint cases are concerned. He would also place reliance on case law. 5. It is now well settled that the offence under Section 138 of the B Act of 1881 is complete upon dishonour of the cheque but prosecution in relation to such offence is postponed, by virtue of the provisos therein, till the failure of the drawer of the cheque to make the payment within 15 days of receiving the demand notice.
