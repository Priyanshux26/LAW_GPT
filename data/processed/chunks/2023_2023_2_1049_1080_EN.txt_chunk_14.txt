11.3. Learned senior counsel has vehemently argued that financial stringency cannot be a reason for denying pensionary benefits to the D employees with reference to the decisions of this Court, including that in Haryana State Minor Irrigation Tubewells Corporation and Ors. v. G.S. Uppal and Ors. : (2008) 7 SCC 375, where, in paragraphs 33 and 34, this Court held that the High Court was right in rejecting the plea of the Corporation about inability to revise the pay scales of the employees E on account of the financial burden on the Corporation. The learned counsel has also referred to the decision of this Court in Punjab State Cooperative Agricultural Development Bank Ltd. v. Registrar, Cooperative Societies and Ors. :(2022) 4 SCC 363. It has further been submitted that other Departments of the State, as noticed by the High Court, have been granted pensionary benefits where the cadre F strength is much larger and hence, any reference to financial stringency is nothing but a bogey argument of the State Government. 11.4. Learned senior counsel for respondent No. 1 has further argued, with reference to the decisions of this Court in D.S. Nakara and Ors. v. Union of India:(1983) 1 SCC 305 and State of Jharkhand G and Ors. v. Jitendra Kumar Srivastava and Anr. :(2013) 12 SCC 210, that pension is neither a bounty nor is it a matter of grace, but is a claimable right. Therefore, feeble reasons such as financial constraints cannot be considered good enough for not extending pensionary benefits to retired employees, who are anyways treated at par with the State H 1068 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A Government employees for other purposes. Rather, the denial of such pensionary rights amounts to hostile discrimination between two sets of employees who are otherwise similarly circumstanced, and remains impermissible, as held by this Court in the case of Air India v. Nergesh Meerza and Ors. :(1981) 4 SCC 335. B 11.5. It has also been submitted that there were 383 employees (past and present) eligible for pension with effect from 01.04.1976, out of which, between the year 1976 to the month of May, 2022, 140 employees have died; at present, the existing posts are only 210 as the Government has abolished 173 posts; and the existing staff strength is only 58 because no appointment has been made since the year 1996. It C has, thus, been contended that while the State Government employees, who are huge in number, are entitled to pension, denial of the same to a miniscule number of the Board employees (who are otherwise treated at par with State Government employees), on the ground of financial stringency does not behove well of a model employer like the State of D Orissa, which is one of the few financially strong States within the Union of India. 11.6. Learned senior counsel has further submitted that in similar circumstances, a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court, by the dated 23.07.2004 in the case of Gujarat State Khadi E Gramodyog Board v. Gujarat State Khadi Gramodyog Pensioners Association: 2004 SCC OnLine Guj 105, allowed the grant of pensionary benefits to the employees of Gujarat State Khadi Gramodyog Board; and thesaid judgement was not interfered with by this Court in SLP (Civil) CC No.1321- 1482 of 2005, which also persuaded the High Court of Orissa to grant similar reliefs by the impugned s and F in the given set of facts, the impugned s would call for no interference.
