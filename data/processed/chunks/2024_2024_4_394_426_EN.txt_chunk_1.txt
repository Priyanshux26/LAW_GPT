26 filed by him – Correctness: Held: The High Court overlooked the fact that the above (Naveen Kumar v. Vijay Kumar and others) was rendered in the context of and for the purposes of the Act of 1988 and not for general application – The itself made it clear that despite the sale/transfer of the vehicle in question, a claimant or claimants should not be made to run from pillar to post to find out who was the owner of the vehicle as on the date of the accident, if the sale/transfer was not carried out in their books by the authorities concerned by registering the name of the subsequent owner, be it for whatever reason – Further, vehicles being goods, their sale would be covered by the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, and the same make it clear that conveyance of ownership of the vehicle would stand concluded upon execution of the document of sale/transfer and registration of the new owner by the authorities concerned would be a post-sale event – Mere failure to get registered the name of the new owner of an already registered vehicle does not mean that the sale/gift transaction would stand invalidated and such a vehicle, despite being physically handed over to the new owner, cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be 396 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports treated as still being in the possession and control of the former owner. [Paras 23, 27] Representation of the People Act, 1951 – ss. 100(1)(b), 100(d) (i) – Election – Filing of nomination – Submission of material particulars – Non-submission of the ‘No Dues Certificate’ in respect of the Government accommodation occupied by appellant during his earlier tenure as an MLA was held against him – High Court held that his nomination was defective and in consequence, the acceptance by the Returning Officer was improper – Correctness: Held: In the case on hand, it is not in dispute that there were no actual outstanding dues payable by KK in relation to the government accommodation occupied by him earlier – His failure in disclosing the fact that he had occupied such accommodation and in filing the ‘No Dues Certificate’ in that regard, with his nomination form, cannot be said to be a defect of any real import – More so, as he did submit the relevant documents of 2014 after an objection was raised before the Returning Officer – His explanation that he submitted such Certificates in the year 2014 when he stood for re-election as an MLA is logical and worthy of acceptance – The most important aspect to be noted is that there were no actual dues and the failure of KK to disclose that he had been in occupation of government accommodation during the years 2009 to 2014 cannot be treated as a defect that is of substantial character so as to taint his nomination and render its acceptance improper. [Para 42] Representation of the People Act, 1951 – Election – Filing of nomination – Non-disclosure of taxes due – The High Court held that non-disclosure of the taxes due and payable by KK and his wife was a defect of substantial character and the same tainted his nomination: Held: The failure on the part of KK to disclose the dues of municipal/ property taxes payable by him and his wife, the same cannot be held to be a non-disclosure, inasmuch as he did disclose the particulars of such dues in one part of his Affidavit but did not do so in another part.
