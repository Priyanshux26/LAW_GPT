Held : The phrase “to search any person” would mean only search of the body or wearing apparels of such person and in that case the procedure which is required to be followed would be the one prescribed under Section 50 of the NDPS Act – In contrast, if search of any building, conveyance or RANJAN KUMAR CHADHA v. 291 STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH place, including a public place, is to be carried out, then there is no question of following the procedure prescribed under Section 50 – However, when a suspected or arrested person is to be searched, then the procedure prescribed under Section 50 comes into operation and the procedure thereunder is required to be followed – This can be seen by referring to Section 100(3) of the CrPC 1973 which provides that where any person is reasonably suspected of concealing about his person any article for which search should be made, such person may be searched and if such person is a woman, the search shall be made by another woman with strict regard to decency– The concealment which is suspected is on the person or about his person.
