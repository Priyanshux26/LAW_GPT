16. This is one case where a Constitutional Court must exercise the power of imposing a special category of modified punishment. The B High Court expressed the view that the punishment imposed by the Trial Court was justified after considering the balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. It is the duty of the Court to consider all attending circumstances.

The Court must consider the rights of the victim as well. After having considered these circumstances, we are of the opinion that this is a case where a fixed-term sentence for a period of thirty years must be imposed. D 17.
