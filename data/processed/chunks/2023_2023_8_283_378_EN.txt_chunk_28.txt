I.A.No.4 of 2019 in OSA No.59 of 2004 B (k) The appellants shall pay costs of Rs.10,000/- to each of the respondents in the OSAs 54, 56-58 of 2004 /claim petitioners/applicants in Application No.585 of 2002, Application No.708 of 2002, Application - No.1319 of 2003 and Application No. 1320 of 2003.” C 88. Before coming to the above conclusions, the Division Bench recorded certain findings. The Bench held that the appellants therein (who are the appellants herein) failed to establish that the land in Hydernagar village is Mathruka property of Khurshid Jah Paigah and that the preliminary decree dated 28.06.1963 as regards the lands in Hydernagar village was vitiated by fraud. The Division Bench further D held that the s obtained in Application No.266 of 1983 and Application No.994 of 1995 are also vitiated by fraud and hence cannot be executed against the claim petitioners and third parties. Even the final decree passed on 24.04.1998 in Application No.517 of 1998 with regard to acres 98.10 guntas in Survey No.172 of Hydernagar was held by the Division Bench to be a nullity. E 89. Insofar as applications for impleadment made by various parties in OSA Nos.54 and 56 to 58 of 2004 were concerned, they were dismissed by the Division Bench on the ground that third parties cannot get impleaded in a claim petition filed by somebody else and that any one claiming a right to property should have filed a separate claim petition. F Insofar as the impleading applications in OSA No.59 of 2004 were concerned, the Division Bench felt that there was no remand of OSA No.59 of 2004 and that therefore, applications for impleading in an appeal not remanded by the Supreme Court cannot be allowed. 90. Challenging the common dated 20.12.2019 passed by G the Division Bench of the High Court for the State of Telangana, several parties have come up with the appeals on hand. The parties who have come up against the impugned include those, (i) who are assignees of the decrees and who wanted the decree to be executed and possession handed over to them; (ii) whose applications for H M/s TRINITY INFRAVENTURES LTD. & ORS. ETC. v. M. S. 327 MURTHY & ORS. ETC. [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] impleadment in OSA Nos.54 and 56 to 58 of 2004 have been dismissed; A (iii) whose applications for impleadment in OSA No.59 of 2004 have been dismissed; (iv) who are concerned about the other half of the land in Hydernagar (Item No.38 of the Plaint Schedule IV), but who have suffered a collateral damage on account of the preliminary decree being held void ab initio; (v) defendant No.58 in the suit, who was not a party B before the High Court, but who claims that the extent of land in Survey No.172 of Hydernagar village to which she became entitled, is now affected by the preliminary decree being held void; and (vi) the State of Telangana. 91. To put it in simple terms, (i) persons whose intra-Court appeals C were dismissed by the High Court; (ii) persons whose applications for impleadment were dismissed by the High Court; (iii) persons who were not party before the High Court but whose rights in respect of the other part of Survey No.172, or other items of properties, are perceived to be affected by the impugned ; and (iv) the State Government, have come up with the appeals.
