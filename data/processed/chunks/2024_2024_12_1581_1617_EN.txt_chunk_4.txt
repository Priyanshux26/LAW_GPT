Appellant filed objection to such application primarily contending on merit that no such clarification was warranted in the facts and circumstances of the case. 14. Learned Arbitrator after hearing the parties issued a clarification on 15.03.2005 vis-à-vis payment of interest. After analysing the provisions of both Section 31(7)(a) and Section 31(7)(b) of the 1996 Act, learned Arbitrator clarified that post-award interest shall be payable on the awarded sum i.e. on the amount of claim awarded plus the interest for the pre-reference period as well as interest pendente lite from the date of the award till it is paid @ 18% per annum. 15.

Against the clarification of the learned Arbitrator dated 15.03.2005, an application was filed by the appellant before the Single Bench being EA(OS) No. 270/2005 in the pending Ex.P. No. 99/1998 for setting aside the said clarification. By the dated 19.02.2008, learned Single Judge, after referring to Section 32 of the 1996 Act and a decision of the Delhi High Court in Ircon International Ltd. Vs. Budhiraja Mining & Construction Ltd.,3 held that learned Arbitrator had become functus officio and, therefore, had no authority to entertain the application for clarification. After 30 days of the award, learned Arbitrator had no authority to make any change in the award. The earlier of the learned Arbitrator awarding simple interest @ 18% per annum on the awarded amount from 01.04.1990 till the date of actual payment takes care of the interest part. Learned Single Judge, therefore, set aside the clarification issued by the learned 3 2007(4) Arb. LR 159 (Delhi) 1588 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Arbitrator, declaring that the award dated 16.12.1997 passed earlier and the interest granted thereunder would hold the field and would be payable by the debtor (appellant) to the holder (respondent). 17. According to the appellant, it paid the interest component and submitted before the executing court that the decree stood satisfied. Learned Single Judge vide the dated 08.10.2010 disposed of the execution petition being Ex.P. No. 99/1998 holding that the decree stood satisfied. 18. Against the dated 19.02.2008, respondent preferred an appeal before the Division Bench being EFA(OS) No. 16/2008. Division Bench vide the dated 23.02.2012 referred to the decision of this Court in S.L. Arora (supra) and held that the settled legal position that prevailed was that compound interest under the 1996 Act could not be granted in view of the decision in S.L. Arora (supra). Resultantly, the amount covered by the compound interest was not payable. It was observed that in view of the settled legal position that respondent was not entitled to compound interest as per the decision in S.L. Arora (supra), the appeal had become an academic exercise.
