49. The theory of motive attributed by the prosecution witnesses (PW-1 and PW-2) to the accused A1 and A2 is also not palpable. It may be noted that the accused appellant(A1) had been posted as Police Inspector at the Amraiwadi Police Station just a few months before the incident. Merely because Jeeva(deceased) was having prior criminal antecedents, that by itself, could not have provided motive [2024] 7 S.C.R. 395 Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat to the accused police officials to have singled him out for custodial torture while totally sparing the co-accused Anna Dorai. 50. As an upshot of the above discussion, we are of the view that the prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt of both the accused persons i.e. Vinod Jaswantray Vyas(A1)(since deceased) and Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel(A2)(since deceased) by leading cogent, convincing and reliable evidence and their conviction as recorded by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court is not sustainable in the eyes of law. 51. Resultantly, the accused appellant Vinod Jaswantray Vyas(A1) (since deceased) deserves to be acquitted of the charges. The co- accused Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel(A2)(since deceased) who too was convicted by the trial Court and his appeal was also dismissed by the High Court, also deserves to be given the benefit of the conclusions drawn by us in this appeal even though no appeal has been preferred on his behalf. 52. As a consequence, the dated 4th March, 1997 passed by the trial Court and dated 13th February, 2017 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court are quashed and set aside. Both the accused i.e. Vinod Jaswantray Vyas(A1)(since deceased) and Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel(A2)(since deceased) are acquitted of the charges. 53. The appeal is allowed in these terms. 54. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
