The said objections were rejected by the Executing Court vide dated 27.05.1994. 3.5 On 19.08.1994, the appellant fi led an application for issuance of fresh warrants of possession and the respondent-Corporation on the same day also moved an application to stay the execution proceedings on the ground that the respondent-Corporation had undertaken land acquisition proceedings of the decretal land. By a subsequent application dated 01.03.1996 the respondent-Corporation stated that it had deposited a sum of Rs. 1,60,000/- with the Land Acquisition Commissioner, Delhi. 3.6 The Executing Court vide dated 19.03.1999 dismissed the said applications of the respondent-Corporation on the ground that the respondent-Corporation had not made any serious eff ort in a span of eight years to acquire the decretal land and that the acquisition of the decretal land can take place even after the same is handed over to the appellant. 3.7 On account of the refusal of the respondent-Corporation to hand over possession of the decretal land to the appellant, the appellant fi led a Contempt Petition before the High Court of Delhi against the respondent- Corporation which was registered as CC No. 126 of 1999, alleging non- compliance of the of the Trial Court. The Contempt Petition was disposed of vide dated 20.02.2003 with directions that it would be open to the appellant to take recourse to such steps as may be permissible for the appellant under the law for getting the encroachers evicted. 606 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 3.8 Upon disposal of the Contempt Petition, the appellant once again got issued warrants for possession of decretal land. Pursuant to the directions of the Executing Court, the respondent-Corporation submitted demarcation reports dated 13.04.2001 and 24.07.2002 in respect of the suit land and raised the issue of acquisition of the said property. 3.9 The Executing Court vide its dated 11.09.2012 while taking into consideration the demarcation reports dismissed the Execution Petition fi led by the appellant on the ground that the encroacher(s) upon the land in question were not ‘party to the suit’ and, therefore, the decree could not be executed. 3.10 Being aggrieved by the dismissal of the execution petition, the appellant preferred a Revision Petition before the High Court of Delhi which was dismissed vide dated 07.04.2016 while holding that the appellant has not, despite specifi c directions, taken any steps to get the encroacher(s) identifi ed. 3.11 The appellant being dissatisfi ed sought review of the and dated 07.04.2016 by fi ling review petition, which saw the same fate as the revision petition. Hence these appeals by way of petitions for special leave to appeal. 4. We have heard Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul and Mr. Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr. Praveen Swarup, learned counsel for respondent and perused the material placed on record. 5. Learned senior counsel for the appellant/ decree-holder strenuously contended that since admittedly the respondent-Corporation executed a lease deed and remained in possession of the suit land as a tenant, which fact is established in favour of the appellant/decree-holder in the suit as also in the execution proceedings, at various stages, it is wholly inappropriate for the respondent-Corporation to contend that it is not in possession of the suit land.
