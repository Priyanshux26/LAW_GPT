This is distinguished from the Forest area and forest land which has been dealt with by this court in the Godavarman case (supra) 22 (2011) 1 SCC 744 Para 30. 724 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in detail since 12.12.1996. The counsel drew our attention to the definition of ‘Forest Cover’ given by the FSI based on the “Minimum Mappable Area” available with FSI from Satellite Data. At present, the Minimum Mappable Area available to FSI for forest cover assessment is 1 (one) hectare since 2001 based on the resolution of satellite data. Prior to 2001, the Minimum Mappable Area for forest cover was 25 hectares from India State of Forest Report 1989 to India State of Forest Report 1999 and the same was 400 ha in 1987. The India State of Forest Report, 2017 which clearly shows that the FSI is describing the term ‘forest cover’ in all its India State of Forest Reports based on the “Minimum Mappable Area” available to them through Satellite Data only based on the technological status and not on any other parameters. Thus, description of the forest cover by FSI was based on the availability of high resolution of Satellite data which has advanced/improved over period of time. Thus, in future, due to technical advancement, FSI might be able to map minimum forest area even less than 1 (one) hectare. However, the States cannot keep on changing the criteria for identification of deemed forests based on such parameters which have been set for an entirely different purpose. Therefore, respondent(s) submit that there is no-co-relation between the parameters set by FSI for identifying deemed forest based on Minimum mappable area and identification of the said area by respective states under the FCA 1980, in view of the dated 12.12.1996 in TN Godavarman case (supra), of this Court. 51. Further, the learned counsel for the respondents submits that if the 0.1 density argument is acceded by this Court, then every 10,000 sq. metres plot which has 10 to 20 trees would have to be determined as a forest and a cumbersome prior clearance would be required on every private land. They also submit that the State of Goa is placed uniquely in the Geographical ecosystem whereas per FSI, the total area under forest cover is about 60.2% under Forest Cover and another 8% as tree cover. This is almost three times the national average and twice the national goal. Thus, in addition to the 68% forest and tress cover, there are areas under the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification; areas under Ecologically Sensitive Area; areas under riverine and other wetlands; areas of no development where gradient is 25%. In other words, no, or very minimal area would be available for any future development. Hence, they submit the [2024] 1 S.C.R. 725 T. N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India and Others approach of the appellant would amount to punishing those people who have diligently planted trees on the private land for increasing the green cover of Goa.
