The inference which this court is left to draw, is that the allottee’s intention was perhaps never to set up any industrial unit, despite its promise to the contrary, and speculatively deal with the plot. Having regard to these facts and circumstances, the court is of the opinion that the impugned does E not call for interference. 23. In view of the above conclusions, this court would have been justified in holding that the appellant is only entitled to refund of the sum of ` 1,66,425/- which was paid for the plot. However, there is no denial of the fact that the cheque issued to him was returned and HSIDC had F the benefit of those monies all these years. In these circumstances, HSIDC is directed to refund the sum of ` 1,66,425/- with interest at 6% p.a. from 18.09.1998 till date. The amounts shall be paid to the appellant, within six weeks from today. 24. The appeals are dismissed, but subject to directions contained G in the previous paragraph; there shall be no on costs. Divya Pandey Appeals dismissed. (Assisted by : Anirudh Agrawal and Rakhi, LCRAs) H
