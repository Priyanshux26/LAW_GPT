The Supreme Council comprises of members of the Church of North India. Their role is to look after the religious and moral instruction to students.114 The administration vests with the Governing Body which predominantly consists of Christians. Though three of the thirteen members of the Governing Body may be non-Christians, that does not dilute the Christian character of the institution. 127. The decisions in Mother Provincial (supra), SK Patro (supra) and St. Stephen’s (supra) emphasise that the indicia for establishment must elucidate the minority character of the educational institution. What is the meaning of the phrase ‘minority character’? Are special rights guaranteed by Article 30(1) only if educational institutions are established ‘for’ the minorities, towards the purpose of protecting minority interests? If yes, when can the courts be certain that the above two conditions are satisfied? That is, what are the ‘core essentials’ of minority character? We will answer this by referring to judicial decisions on four questions. Clarity over the essentials of the minority character will help us ascertain the indicia for ‘establishment’ of a minority educational institution. 109 ibid [33] 110 ibid [34] 111 Memorandum of the Society and Rules, Clause 2 112 Memorandum of the Society and Rules, Clause 4 113 ibid [35] 114 ibid [36] 1746 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 128. The first question that arose in earlier cases was whether a minority educational institution must be established towards the conservation of the distinct language, script or culture of linguistic and religious minorities protected by Article 29(1). In Rev. Father W. Proost v. The State of Bihar,115 a Constitution Bench answered the question in the negative. The Bench held that Article 30(1) covers a minority educational institution which is established to conserve culture and language. However, that need not be the only purpose for the establishment of the institution. This Court held that the scope of Article 30(1) cannot be restricted by Article 29(1).116 In St. Xavier (supra), the majority of the nine-Judge Bench approved this interpretation.117 129. The second question that arose in earlier decisions was whether an educational institution would retain its minority character even if non-minorities are admitted in it. Would a Muslim minority education institution retain its minority character when it admits students from other faiths in the institution? In re the Kerala Education Bill 1957 (supra), a seven-Judge Bench held that a minority educational institution would not lose its minority character by merely admitting students belonging to non-minorities and that the provision contemplates an institution with a ‘sprinkling of outsiders’.118 This position was further fortified in TMA Pai (supra). In TMA Pai (supra), Article 29(2) and Article 30(1) were read harmoniously to hold that Article 29(2) would apply to a limited extent to minority educational institutions as well.119 Thus, an aided minority educational institution 115 [1969] 2 SCR 73 116 Rev.
