In pursuance of this decision, Notification No.1/CA(7)/3/88 dated 13.01.1989 was issued by the Council, setting the limit of thirty tax audits. Admittedly, at this point, the ceiling limit was intended as only a self-regulatory mechanism to be followed by all members. 3.12 The vires and constitutionality of aforesaid Notification No. 1/CA(7)/3/88, dated 13.01.1989 was the subject of much litigation before several High Courts. In fact, the Notification was successfully challenged by a practicing Chartered Accountant, in Writ Petition No.5925 of 1989 before the Madras High Court. The legality and validity of the Notification No.1/CA(7)/3/88, dated 13.01.1989 as also Notification No.1-CA(7)/15887 dated 25.05.1987 was also assailed in Writ Petition No.5926 of 1989. The central challenge in both writ petitions was to the Notifications being violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. Of imminent interest is the constitutional challenge to the ceiling limit in Writ Petition No.5925/1989. The Madras High Court observed that ‘accepting a legitimate professional engagement by a professional can never be considered unprofessional and be made a misconduct’. It was further noted that, once a person acquires the requisite qualifications to be a Chartered Accountant, he would be free to engage himself in the profession restricted only by conduct marred with dishonesty and inviting condemnation. Therefore, it was observed that the Act and the Rules could bring in restrictions or provisions only for the purpose of attaining the aforesaid professional standards. The in Writ Petition No.5925 of 1989 was affirmed by the Division Bench in Writ Appeal Nos.1452-1453 of 1998, on 24.03.2005. Furthermore, in SLP(C) Nos. 14370-14371/2005 preferred by respondent-Institute, this Court vide dated 29.07.2005, issued notice and granted a stay on the operation 796 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the of learned Division Bench of Madras High Court. The aforesaid captioned Special Leave Petitions were admitted as Civil Appeal Nos. 7208-7209 of 2005. 3.13 Certain other High Courts dismissed the challenge to the vires and constitutionality of the Notification dated 13.01.1989. Amongst others, four such petitions filed before the Madhya Pradesh High Court have been brought to our attention, being Miscellaneous Petition No.2844 of 1989 – Prem Chand vs. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India; Miscellaneous Petition No.2792 of 1990 – Ram Narain vs. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India; Miscellaneous Petition No.4202 of 1992 – Arun Grover vs. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India; and Miscellaneous Petition No.3307 of 1993 – Anil Kumar Gupta vs. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. The challenge in all the above captioned petitions was to the validity and legality of the Notification dated 13.01.1989. By way of a common dated 18.04.1995 passed by the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, the aforesaid writ petitions were dismissed holding that the Notification does not take away the right of petitioners to carry on their profession but only placed a ceiling limit for purposes of effective and business-like audit. Furthermore, the Division Bench of the High Court found that public interest was met by distribution of work amongst many Chartered Accountants.
