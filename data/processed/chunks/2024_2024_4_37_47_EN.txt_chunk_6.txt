More recently, in Laxmi Srinivasa R and P Boiled Rice Mill v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr.6 (2-Judge Bench), this Court followed the dictum in Consolidated Engg. Enterprises (Supra) and M.P. Steel (Supra) to exclude the time period undertaken by the Plaintiff therein in pursuing remedy under Writ Jurisdiction, in the absence of challenge to the bona fides of the Plaintiff, in view of Section 14. 37. No substantial averment has come on record to substantiate the claim that the predecessor in interest of the Plaintiff approached the Tehsildar with any mala fide intention, in the absence of good faith or with the knowledge that it was not the Court having competent jurisdiction to execute the decree. The object to advance the cause of justice, as well must be kept in mind. 38. We do not find the reasoning given by the learned High Court in paragraph 9 while rejecting the plea for exclusion of time to be sustainable. On a perusal of the record, it is apparent that the Plaintiff has pursued the matter bonafidely and diligently and in good faith before what it believed to be the appropriate forum and, therefore, such time period is bound to be excluded when computing limitation before 5 [2021] 3 SCR 806 : (2021) 7 SCC 313 6 2022 SCC Online SC 1790 [2024] 4 S.C.R. 47 Purni Devi & Anr. v. Babu Ram & Anr. the Court having competent jurisdiction. All conditions stipulated for invocation of Section 14 of the Limitation Act are fulfilled. 39. Therefore, in view of the above discussion the period from 18.12.2000, when the execution application was filed to 29.01.2005, when the prior proceeding was dismissed, has to be excluded while computing period of limitation, which results in the execution application filed by the Plaintiff, being within the limitation period prescribed under Article 182 of the Limitation Act as well, which is 3 years. 40. Consequently, the appeal is allowed. The impugned of the High Court dated 09.04.2018 and Munsiff Court, Hiranagar dated 28.11.2007 are set aside. The execution application of the Plaintiff is restored to the file of the Munsiff Court, Hiranagar for fresh consideration, in consonance with the view on limitation which has been decided above. 41. Pending applications, if any, are disposed of. No as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan Result of the case: Appeal allowed.
