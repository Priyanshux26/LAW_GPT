The State of Gujarat also accepted the recommendations of the Tikku Committee for allopathic doctors and issued an in Resolution No.GHS/1094/2842/T dated 17.10.1994. It was stated in the said dated 17.10.1994 that adequate number of allopathic doctors was not available in the State and that therefore, it was necessary to attract talent. F 7. After the implementation of the recommendations of the Tikku Committee dated 31.10.1990 in respect of allopathic doctors, in the State of Gujarat by the Government Resolution dated 17.10.1994, the Local Fund Audit, Ahmedabad sought clarifications, vide letters dated 04.03.1998 and 21.04.1998, as to whether the same benefits are available to non- G MBBS medical officers holding qualifications such as G.A.F.M/LMP. 8. In response, the Health and Family Welfare Department of the Government of Gujarat issued a Government Resolution bearing No.KRV/ 1098/726/CH dated 01.01.1999, holding that non-MBBS medical officers are also entitled to the benefit. Incidentally this letter stated that the H 306 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A recommendations of the Tikku Committee were extended even to doctors working under the Employees State Insurance Scheme, vide Government Resolution dated 01.07.1997. 9. The respondents herein who were originally appointed on adhoc basis, under the ‘Community Health Volunteer Medical Officers Scheme’ B floated by the Government of India and who were later absorbed by the State of Gujarat in May- 1999, filed 4 writ petitions on the file of the High Court of Gujarat seeking extension of the benefit of higher scales of pay on the basis of the recommendations of Tikku Pay Commission. A separate writ petition was filed by the Medical Officers (Ayurved) Association, comprising of persons initially appointed as Medical Officers C Class-III. The relief sought by this Association was similar to the one sought in the batch of four writ petitions. 10. By a common dated 26.07.2012, a learned Judge of the High Court allowed all the writ petitions, holding that doctors having degrees in alternative Systems of Medicine are entitled to be treated at D par with doctors holding MBBS degree. 11. The State of Gujarat preferred intra-court appeals. After filing appeals, the State also issued a Government Resolution dated 31.07.2013 withdrawing the Resolution dated 01.01.1999 by which the benefit was extended to non-MBBS degree holders. This was because the learned E Single Judge held that discrimination between non-MBBS degree holders working in the ESI Scheme and non-MBBS degree holders working in other areas was not permissible. 12. But the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed all the F intra-court appeals holding, (i) that both MBBS and non-MBBS doctors form part of the same cadre and hence no discrimination is permissible within the cadre on the basis of educational qualifications; and (ii) that the non-MBBS doctors were also discharging the same duties and functions discharged by MBBS doctors and were even manning primary health centres independently and that therefore they were entitled to G equal pay. 13. Aggrieved by the said of the Division Bench of the High Court, the State has come up with the above appeals.
