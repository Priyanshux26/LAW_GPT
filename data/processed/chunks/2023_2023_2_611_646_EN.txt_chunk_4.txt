The existence of a policy D issued by the State Government is a sine qua non for making appointments on compassionate basis. The appointments must follow the stipulations made in the policy. In the absence of a policy governing compassionate appointment to posts under a local authority, no appointment could be made to such an authority on compassionate grounds. Having held that Circular Nos. 301- E Emp, 302-Emp and 303-Emp. cannot be held to be applicable to local authorities, the findings of the Division Bench of the High Court to the effect that given that Circular No. 301-Emp., 302- Emp. and 303 Emp. were not specifically withdrawn, they would continue to remain applicable and therefore, compassionate F appointment in respect of municipalities would be governed by the scheme under Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302- Emp. and 303- Emp cannot be affirmed.

DEBABRATA TIWARI & 617 ORS. ETC. ETC. Bengal and hence, in the absence of such a policy, compassionate A appointment cannot be granted. Assuming that there was such a policy, it would be of no redeeming purpose to direct that the applications for appointment on compassionate grounds be considered and decided several years after they were filed.
