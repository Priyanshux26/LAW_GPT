921 Commissioner of Central Excise, Salem v. M/s Madhan Agro Industries (India) Private Ltd. Heading 1513 in the First Schedule to the Act of 1985. In consequence, the coconut oil marketed and sold by the respondents during the relevant period must necessarily be classified as edible oil. 46. Pertinently, in Dunlop India Ltd. vs. Union of India and others,10 a 3-Judge Bench of this Court pointed out that it is good fiscal policy to not put people in doubt and quandary about their liability to pay duty and that when an article has, by all standards, a reasonable claim to be classified under an enumerated item in the Tariff Schedule, it would be against the very principle of classification to deny it that parentage and consign it to an orphanage of the residuary clause. Applying that standard, once a specific heading was created for coconut oil in the First Schedule, something more would be required before such oil can be excluded therefrom and classified under the general heading pertaining to toilet and cosmetic preparations. Equally important is certainty and consistency in the stand of the Revenue. 47. Reliance placed by the Revenue on State of Haryana vs. Dalmia Dadri Cement Ltd.,11 in support of its contention that the expression ‘for use’ can only mean ‘intended for use’ and not ‘actual use’, is misplaced as that decision turned upon the language of Section 5(2)(a)(iv) of the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948, and the said interpretation cannot be applied mutatis mutandis in the present case, as the wording of the provisions presently under consideration and the rules of interpretation applicable thereto are entirely different. The argument of the Revenue that the fact that edible coconut oil marketed by the respondents could also be used as hair oil is therefore not sufficient to classify the same under Heading 3305 with nothing further. As pointed out by this Court in HPL Chemicals Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Central Excise, Chandigarh,12 classification of goods is a matter relating to chargeability and the burden of proof is squarely upon the Revenue if it intends to classify the goods under a particular heading or sub-heading different from that claimed by the assesses. In such an event, the Revenue had to adduce proper evidence and discharge that burden of proof in the context of the 10 [1976] 2 SCR 98 : (1976) 2 SCC 241 11 [1988] 2 SCR 1 : AIR 1988 SC 342 12 [2006] Supp. 1 SCR 125 : (2006) 5 SCC 208 922 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports classification entries, which it failed to do satisfactorily in the cases on hand. 48. On the above analysis, we are of the opinion that pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as ‘edible oil’ would be classifiable under Heading 1513 in Section III-Chapter 15 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, unless the packaging thereof satisfies all the requirements set out in Chapter Note 3 in Section VI-Chapter 33 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, read with the General/Explanatory Notes under the corresponding Chapter Note 3 in Chapter 33 of the Harmonized System of Nomenclature, whereupon it would be classifiable as ‘hair oil’ under Heading 3305 in Section VI-Chapter 33 thereof.
