[Paras 100-103] Customs Act, 1962 – s.2(34) – Proper officer – DRI officers as proper officers u/s 2(34): Held: In Canon India’s case, this Court erroneously concluded that officer from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) was not an officer of customs and thus, cannot function as a “Proper Officer” – Finding that the power conferred by the Board under Notification No. 40/2012-Customs (N.T.) dated 02.05.2012 was ill-founded is an error apparent – By way of Notification No. 40/2012-Customs [2024] 12 S.C.R. 207 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. (N.T. ), the Board appointed several persons including the Officers of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) as “Proper Officers” u/s.2(34) – Notification No. 40/2012-Customs (N.T.) issued u/s.2(34) cannot be read in isolation – It has to be read in conjunction with s.4(1) and the Notification issued thereunder – View that the “Proper Officer” for the purpose of s.28 and other provisions of the 1962 Act could only mean the person who cleared the goods or the officer who succeeds such officer and not any other officer from any other department requires reconsideration in view of the changes to the 1962 Act vide the Finance Act, 2011 and s.4 and the notification issued thereunder – Court in Canon India’s case proceeded on the footing that under the provisions of the Act, 1962, the Board has no power to appoint “Proper Officers” – As per s.4(1), the Board is vested with the power to appoint such persons as it thinks fit to be “officers of customs”, u/s.4(2) the Board can even authorize a Chief Commissioner of Customs or a Joint or Assistant or Deputy Commissioner of Customs to appoint any officers below the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Customs as an “officer of customs” – This aspect was not brought to the notice in Canon India’s case. [Paras 106-113] Customs Act, 1962 – s.4 – Appointment of “Officers of Customs: Held: It is only an officer of customs, appointed u/s.4(1) who can be designated as the “proper officer” as defined in s.2(34) by a notification – Notifications issued u/ss.2(34) and 4(1) are nothing but an internal arrangement for the purpose of allocation of work among the officers of customs. [Para 115] Customs Act, 1962 – s.6 – Entrustment of functions of Board and customs officers on certain other officers – Application of s.6: Held: s.6 contemplates the entrustment of the functions of the Board or any officer of customs under the Act to any of the officers of the Central or the State Government or a local authority – Such entrustment could be either conditional or unconditional – Object of this Section is to confer powers of search, seizure, arrest and recording of statements, to the officers working in b states as also officers working in the coast guard or the navy as they may be involved in anti smuggling operations – Plain reading of 208 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports s.6 makes it abundantly clear that it applies only to officers from departments other than the officers of the customs u/s.4 – Officers of DRI are not any other officers of the Central Government or the State Government or the local authority to be entrusted with the functions of the Board and the Customs Officers – Post 07.03.2002, a notification of the Central Government u/s.6 is not required to recognise the officers from DRI as officers of customs – Assignment of functions of proper officers as mentioned in s.2(34) and entrustment of functions of customs officers as mentioned in s.6 operate on different planes – Assignment of functions of proper officer is to be done only to officers of customs (whether appointed u/s.4 or entrusted with certain functions u/s.6) – There may be some overlap between assignment of functions of proper officers u/s.2(34) rw s.5 and entrustment of functions of officers of customs u/s.6 in some instances but there can be no scenario where it can be held that “functions” u/s.6 and s.2(34) are congruent – One of the basis for the decision in Canon India’s case was that no entrustment of functions u/s.6 was done in favour of DRI officers, which is a misapplication of s.6 and is in ignorance of the applicable law, ss.2(34) rw s.5 of the Act.
