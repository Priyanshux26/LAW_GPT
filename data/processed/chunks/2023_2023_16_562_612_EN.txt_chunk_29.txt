Essar Steel India Limited v Satish Kumar Gupta,22 underscores the non- adjudicatory nature of the resolution professional’s role. Further support for the administrative role of the resolution professional is drawn from the BLRC’s drafting instructions, affi rming that the resolution professional’s role is primarily administrative for information and documentation collation and verifi cation of the creditor’s claim under Section 95 of the IBC.23 19 UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Insolvency, 2004, Part 2(I), paras 56, 57. 20 AIR 1962 SC 1621 21 (2019) 4 SCC 17 22 (2020) 8 SCC 531, Para 48. 23 The Report of the Bankruptcy Laws Reforms Committee, Volume I, 4 November 2015, at 115-118. (cid:2) DR. DHANANJAYA Y. CHANDRACHUD, CJI (cid:3) 604 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 70. We would also like to deal with the submission that the resolution professional is empowered to direct the personal guarantor and others to disclose sensitive personal information without a prior hearing. This demand for information, lacking an opportunity for the personal guarantor to be heard, raises (according to the petitioners) concerns about violating the right to privacy. We are of the considered view that the resolution professional, operating under the regulatory oversight of the Board, plays a vital role in the eff ective functioning of the insolvency process and contributes signifi cantly to its effi ciency. Firstly, the resolution professional is only entitled to seek information which is strictly relevant to the examination of the application for IRP; and secondly, regulation 7(2)(h) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Professionals) Regulations, 2016 read with para 21 of the First Schedule, casts an obligation on the resolution professional to ensure confi dentiality of all information relating to the insolvency process. The BLRC also acknowledges the information imbalance between debtors and creditors, necessitating the resolution professional’s investigative role in individual insolvency.24 Therefore, Section 99 empowers the resolution professional to seek information. 71. In K.S. Puttaswamy (9 Judge Bench) v Union of India25, this Court laid down the threshold requirements to balance privacy with legitimate state interest emanating from the procedural and content-based mandate of Article 21, as follows - (a) legality, i.e. there must be a law in existence; (b) the pursuit of a legitimate aim; and (c) proportionality of the legitimate aims with the object sought to be achieved. The right to privacy is subject to reasonable restraints. In the context of Section 99(4), the legitimate aims of establishing a comprehensive framework for individual insolvency and aiding the adjudicating authority justify seeking personal fi nancial information, balancing privacy rights with the objective. 72. We are of the view that the submission that an adjudicatory role should be interposed at the stage of Section 97(5) cannot be accepted. The power which is conferred on the adjudicating authority at the stage of fi ling of an application is to appoint a resolution professional. The appointment of 24 The Report of Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee, Volume I, 2015, Para 6.3.2. 25 (2017) 10 SCC 1, para 310. DILIP B JIWRAJKA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS 605 a resolution professional is for the purpose of a facilitative exercise which is contemplated by Section 99 which, as we have noted, eventually ends in a report either recommending the acceptance or rejection of the application.
