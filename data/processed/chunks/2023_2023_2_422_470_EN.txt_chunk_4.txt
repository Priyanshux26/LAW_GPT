In such a case, since the mischief lies only within the classification, it can be severed, and the remaining part of the executive actions that sets out to grant compensation for the purpose of rehabilitation remains valid in law. Once the classification is E removed, and the executive actions are read in consonance with the parent act, it would be seen that since the Act, and now even the executive actions do not discriminate in terms of compensation, the ex gratia payment and the increased base amount, as enunciated by the executive actions, must be given to all landowners in the subject area. [Paras 62, 63][468-H; 469- F A-C] 4.2 Further, in cases of administrative action, even if the classification has a rational nexus to the objective of the notification, the classification must also be legitimized by the parent statute. If the parent statute does not allow for a G classification, then, even if the classification vis-à-vis the notification is able to pass the tests of Article 14, it would still be liable to struck down if the parent statute does not allow for the same. The impugned passed by the Full Bench of the High Court is not liable to be sustained and stands set aside. As H 428 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A a consequence, the Writ Petition filed by the appellants before the High Court stands allowed and the appellants are held entitled to the reliefs claimed in the said Writ Petition.
