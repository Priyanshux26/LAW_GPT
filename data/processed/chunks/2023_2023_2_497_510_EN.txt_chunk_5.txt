II. Contentions of the Parties E 7. Mr Shyam Divan, Ld. Senior Advocate for the appellants, submitted that the Executing Court went behind the decree by enlarging its scope, through an analysis of the pleadings, which it was not empowered to do, as held by several s of this Court, such as Meenakshi Saxena v. ECGC Ltd.5 It was emphasised that the F agreement entered into by the parties orally on 27.03.2019 was facilitated by a mediator, Shri Pawan Didwania, and affirmed that very evening in the presence of a second mediator, Shri Satyanarayan N. Shrimali, and recorded in writing on the next day, i.e., 28.03.2019 via email, with no discussion on inclusion of outstanding loans. The Agrawals agreed to G only the terms of the e-mail dated 28.03.2019 and not any later correspondence, even though there was a mention of such correspondence and letters in the plaints and averments. Therefore, this was a clear case where the parties consciously chose to embody only the terms agreed upon, and reduced to writing, as the terms of the decree. H 5 Meenakshi Saxena v. ECGC Ltd., (2018) 7 SCC 479. SANWARLAL AGRAWAL v. ASHOK KUMAR KOTHARI 505 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 8. It was submitted that the High Court fell into error in taking A note of selective emails / letters while considering the pleadings even if arguendo it were permissible for it to do so. It was pointed out that the suit averments clearly recounted in an elaborate manner the exchange of e-mails and was not confined to e-mail dated 29.03.2019, rather also other e-mails such as the one addressed by the respondent / plaintiff i.e., B Kotharis on 03.04.2019, the e-mail from Agrawals to this email, on 11.04.2019 clearly disputing the Kotharis’ interpretation with respect to the conditions of the settlement. The suit also referred to another e-mail dated 19.04.2019, which reiterated Kotharis’ position that the sum of 36.75 cores was a ‘composite amount’, and nothing further was payable to the Agrawals. In the same way, learned counsel also relied upon C other e-mails exchanged after Kotharis filed the suit, i.e., dated 19.07.2019 and 23.07.2019. In these circumstances, the Court could not have relied only on two or three e-mails while interpreting the decree to mean something more than what its terms stated. 9. Mr Diwan relied upon the affidavit of the first mediator, Shri D Pawan Didwania, wherein he clearly stated that there was never any discussion or agreement on adjustment of any loan, and that the Agrawals would receive 36.75 crores from the Kotharis for their 50% shareholding only. 10. On the other hand, Mr Shekhar Naphade and Mr. Pallav E Shishodia, learned senior counsels appearing on behalf of the Kotharis, urged that that impugned did not warrant any interference. The decree for specific performance was passed on admission by the Agrawals in terms of the agreement reflected in the email dated 28.03.2019. The expressions used in the email i.e., ‘consolidated price’; F that the settlement would provide ‘full control’; that the agreement was for purchase of the Agrawal’s ‘stake’; and was for ‘smooth transition’, clearly pointed to a complete separation of the groups.
