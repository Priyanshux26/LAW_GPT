), the relevant portion of which reads as under: “22. However, there is one clear ground or charge in the complaint filed under the PML Act, which is free from perceptible legal challenge and the facts as alleged are tentatively supported by material and evidence. This discussion is equally relevant for the charge-sheet filed by the CBI under the PoC Act and IPC. We would like to recapitulate the facts as alleged, which it is stated establish an offence under Section 3 of the PML Act and the PoC Act. These are: • In a period of about ten months, during which the new excise policy was in operation, the wholesale distributors had earned Rs. 581,00,00,000 (rupees five hundred eighty one crores only) as the fixed fee. • The one time licence fee collected from 14 wholesale distributors was about Rs. 70,00,00,000 (rupees seventy crores only). • Under the old policy 5% commission was payable to the wholesale distributors/licensees. The difference between the 12%; minus 5% of the wholesale profit margin plus Rs. 70,00,00,000/-; it is submitted, would constitute proceeds of crime, an offence punishable under the PML Act. The proceeds 55 [2023] 15 SCR 480 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1393 2414 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of crime were acquired, used and were in possession of the wholesale distributors who have unlawfully benefitted from illegal gain at the expense of the government exchequer and the consumers/ buyers. Relevant portion of the criminal complaint filed by the DoE dated 04.05.2023, reads: “One of the reasons given by Sh Manish Sisodia is to compensate the wholesaler for increased license fee from Rs. 5 lacs to Rs. 5 Cr. During this policy period, 14 LI licences were given by Excise Department, by raising the license fee for LI to Rs. 5 Cr in the entire period of operation of the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-2022, the Govt. has earned Rs. 75.16 Cr from the license fee of LI (as per Excise department communication dated 11.04.2023) (RUD 34). On the other hand the excess profit earned by the wholesalers during this period is to the tune of Rs. 338 Cr. (7% additional profit earned due to increase from 5% to 12%, Rs. 581 Cr being the total profit of LI as informed by Excise department). Therefore there is no logical correlation between the license fee increase and the profit margin increase. Whereas this excess profit margin benefit could have been passed on to the consumers in form of lower MRP. Contrary to the claim that the policy was meant to benefit the public or the exchequer, it was rather a conspiracy to ensure massive illegal gains to a select few private players/individuals/entities.” 23. The charge-sheet under the PoC Act includes offences for unlawful gains to a private person at the expense of the public exchequer. Reference in this regard is made to the provisions of Sections 7, 7A, 8 and 12 of the PoC Act. 24. Clauses (a) and (b) to Section 7 of the PoC Act apply : (a) when a public servant obtains, accepts or intends to obtain from another person undue advantage with the intent to perform or fail to improperly or to forbear or cause forbearance to cause by himself or by another person; (b) obtains or accepts or attempts to obtain undue advantage [2024] 7 S.C.R.
