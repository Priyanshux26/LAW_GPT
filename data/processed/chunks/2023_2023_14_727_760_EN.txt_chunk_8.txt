Sometimes statements relevant to or furnishing an immediate motive may also be admissible as being a part of the transaction of death. It is manifest that all these statements come to light only after the death of the deceased who speaks from death. For instance, where the death takes place within a very short time of the marriage or the distance of time is not spread over more than 3-4 months the statement may be admissible under Section 32. 6 (1984) 4 SCC 116 [3 Judge Bench] 740 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. (3) The second part of clause (1) of Section 32 is yet another exception to the rule that in criminal law the evidence of a person who was not being subjected to or given an opportunity of being cross-examined by the accused, would be valueless because the place of cross-examination is taken by the solemnity and sanctity of oath for the simple reason that a person on the verge of death is not likely to make a false statement unless there is strong evidence to show that the statement was secured either by prompting or tutoring. (4) It may be important to note that Section 32 does not speak of homicide alone but includes suicide also, hence all the circumstances which may be relevant to prove a case of homicide would be equally relevant to prove a case of suicide. (5) Where the main evidence consists of statements and letters written by the deceased which are directly connected with or related to her death and which reveal a tell-tale story, the said statement would clearly fall within the four corners of Section 32 and, therefore, admissible. The distance of time alone in such cases would not make the statement irrelevant.” 11.4 Numerous s have held that provided a dying declaration inspires confi dence of the court it can, even sans corroboration, form the sole basis of conviction. In this regard, reference may be made to Khushal Rao v. State of Bombay7, Suresh Chandra Jana v. State of West Bengal8 and Jayamma v. State of Karnataka9. 11.5 In to rely on such a statement, it must fully satisfy the confi dence of the court, since the person who made such a statement is no longer available for cross-examination or clarifi cation or for any such like activity. 11.5.1 In Madan v. State of Maharashtra10, while referring to an earlier decision in Ram Bihari Yadav v. State of Bihar11 it 7 AIR 1958 SC 22 [3 Judge Bench] 8 (2017) 16 SCC 466 [2 Judge Bench] 9 (2021) 6 SCC 213 [3 Judge Bench] 10 (2019) 13 SCC 464 [2 Judge Bench] 11 (1998) 4 SCC 517 [2 Judge Bench] MANJUNATH & ORS. v. STATE OF KARNATAKA 741 [SANJAY KAROL, J.] was observed that a Court must rely on dying declaration if it inspires confi dence in the mind of the court. 11.5.2 On a similar note, this Court in Panneerselvam v. State of T.N12 has observed: – “Though a dying declaration is entitled to great weight, it is worthwhile to note that the accused has no power of cross- examination.
