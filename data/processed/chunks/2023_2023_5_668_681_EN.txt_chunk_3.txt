F 15.3 Issue No.3:- In line with our dated 14.09.2020 in Appeal No.182 of 2019, we hold that the change in law compensation shall be calculated based on the SHR specified in the MERC MYT Regulations, 2011 or the actual SHR whichever is lower and actual GCV of coal G as received as the plant site. 15.4 Issue No.4:- We find that the directions issued by the State Commission regarding advance intimation requirement is not consistent with normal Rules of MOD preparation and also does not provide a level playing H field for IPPs. MAHARASHTRA STATE ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION CO. LTD. v. 673 ADANI POWER MAHARASHTRA LTD. [B. R. GAVAI, J. ] 15.5 Issue No.5:- We find that allowance of carrying cost A is a settled position of law and the State Commission has already allowed the same to the Appellant, APML.” 9. Consequently, the APTEL dismissed the appeal preferred by MSEDCL and allowed the appeal preferred by APML. Hence, MSEDCL has preferred the present appeals. B 10. We have heard Shri Gopal Jain, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant-MSEDCL and Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No. 1–APML. C 11. Shri Jain submitted that the SHAKTI Policy (Part-B) restores the position as covered by NCDP 2007. He, therefore, submits that, since under the SHAKTI Policy there is 100% assured coal supply, then there is no question of APML being compensated on account of shortfall in coal supply. He submits that SHAKTI Policy is in continuation of D NCDP 2007. However, this has not been taken into consideration by the learned APTEL. 12. Shri Jain further submits that both APTEL and MERC have failed to take into consideration that APML had not complied with the condition of serving a mandatory notice to MSEDCL for Change in Law E under Article 13.3.2 of the 1320 MW PPA. 13. Dr. Singhvi, on the contrary, submits that undisputedly, SHAKTI Policy would amount to Change in Law. He submits that there is a concurrent finding of fact by both APTEL and MERC that SHAKTI Policy is a Change in Law event. F 14. Dr. Singhvi further submits that there is also a concurrent finding by APTEL and MERC on the issue of mandatory notice. He submits that unless these findings are found to be perverse or are based on extraneous consideration, it will not be permissible for this Court to interfere with the same. G 15. When the batch of appeals was being heard, it was agreed between all the parties that this Court should first decide Civil Appeal No. 684 of 2021 (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) v. ADANI Power Maharashtra Limited (APML) H 674 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A and Others2) and Civil Appeal No. 6927 of 2021 (MSEDCL v. GMR Warora Energy Ltd. and Others) inasmuch as three of the issues involved in all the appeals were common. It was submitted that those two appeals could be decided by deciding the three common issues.
