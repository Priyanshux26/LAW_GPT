89. It must also be borne in mind that life has its pitfalls and is not smooth sailing all along the way (as a claimant would have us believe) as the hiccups that invariably come about cannot be visualised. Life it is said is akin to a ride on a roller-coaster where a meteoric rise is often followed by an equally spectacular fall, and the distance between the two (as in this very case) is a minute or a yard.” In the very same , it was further observed, particularly in cases of the person being injured:- “90. At the same time we often find that a person injured in an accident leaves his family in greater distress vis-à-vis a family in a case of death. In the latter case, the initial shock gives way to a feeling of resignation and acceptance, and in time, compels the family to move on. The case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution enures every 12 [2009] 9 SCR 313 : (2009) 6 SCC 1 [2024] 4 S.C.R. 767 Jyoti Devi v. Suket Hospital & Ors. day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity.” 12.3.1 It would also be instructive to refer to the concept of ‘just compensation’. The idea of compensation is based on restitutio in integrum, which means, make good the loss suffered, so far as money is able to do so, or, in other words, take the receiver of such compensation, back to a position, as if the loss/injury suffered by them hadn’t occurred. In Sarla Verma v. DTC13 this Court observed that compensation doesn’t acquire the quality of being just simply because the Tribunal awarding it believes it to be so. For it to be so, it must be, (i) adequate; (ii) fair; and (iii) equitable, in the facts and circumstances of each case. This understanding was reiterated in Balram Prasad v. Kunal Saha and Ors14, V. Krishnakumar v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors,15 and Nand Kishore Prasad v. Mohib Hamidi and Ors16. 12.3.2 What qualifies as just compensation, as noticed above, has to be considered in the facts of each case. In Balram Prasad (supra) it has been observed that this court has been ‘skeptical about using a straightjacket multiplier method for determining the quantum of compensation in medical negligence claims’. 12.3 Eggshell Skull Rule 12.4.1 This rule (applied by the NCDRC) holds the injurer liable for damages that exceed the amount that would normally be expected to occur. It is a common law doctrine that makes a defendant liable for the plaintiff’s unforeseeable and uncommon reactions to the defendant’s negligent 13 [2009] 5 SCR 1098 : (2009) 6 SCC 1 14 [2013] 12 SCR 30 : (2014) 1 SCC 384 15 [2015] 8 SCR 100 : (2015) 9 SCC 388 16 [2019] 7 SCR 1076 : (2019) 6 SCC 512 768 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
