THE STATE OF BIHAR & ORS. 409 Appearances: Abhay Kumar, Rajat Khattry, Shagun Ruhil, Ms. Neetu Jain, Advs. for the Appellant. R. Basant, Sr. Adv., Neeraj Shekhar, Sunny Choudhary, Manoj Kumar, Devashish Bharuka, Ms. Sarvshree, Ms. Nishi Kashyap, Advs. for the Respondents. / OF THE SUPREME COURT VIKRAM NATH, J. 1. Everything was going as per the plan and wish of the main accused Prabhunath Singh, a political leader and a sitting Member of Parliament at the relevant time as he had mustered full support of the Administration and the Investigating Agency; he had infl uenced and won over almost all the witnesses of fact mentioned in the chargesheet (who were declared hostile), the relevant formal witnesses including the Investigating Offi cer were not produced in the trial by the prosecution, the Public Prosecutor prosecuting the case was supporting the defence, the Presiding Offi cers were completely insensitive towards their pious duty, but everything turned upside down when he committed a glaring mistake and that one mistake cost him heavily. He got the court witness, Smt. Lalmuni Devi, mother of deceased Rajendra Rai abducted ten days before the date fi xed for recording her statement. This led to fi ling of a Habeas Corpus Petition before the High Court, a report submitted by the Inspecting Judge as a result of an unruly incident which occurred in the Trial Court on the date Smt. Lalmuni Devi-CW-1 deposed before the Trial Court and another report of the Inspecting Judge commenting upon the of acquittal by the Trial Court. All these aspects would be dealt in detail at a later stage.
