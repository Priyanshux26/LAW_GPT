This led to the registration of FIR4 by the Economic Offences Wing under Sections 409 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) (registered as Crime No. 1534/2020). The contents of the FIR alleged that RFL had placed four FDs with a combined value of ₹750 Crores as security for short-term loans. LVB extended loans to RHC Holding and Ranchem, utilizing these FDs as security. When RHC Holding and Ranchem defaulted on their loan payments, LVB debited an amount of ₹723.71 crores from RFL’s current account without obtaining proper authorization or prior notice. 4. Meanwhile, due to high net levels of Non-Performing Assets, inadequate Capital to Risk (Weighted) Average Ratio and Common 1 Crl. A. No. 2242 / 2023 & Crl.A. No. 2243 / 2023. 2 Dated 24.3.2023 in Crl. M. C. No. 3173 of 2021. 3 (Comm.) No. 940/2018. 4 FIR No. 189/2019. RELIGARE FINVEST LIMITED v. STATE OF NCT OF 201 DELHI & ANR. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] Equity Tier-I Capital, two years of negative Return on Assets, and high leverage, the Reserve Bank of India (hereafter “RBI”) placed LVB under “Prompt Corrective Action”5. 5. A chargesheet was filed against ten bank officials of LVB; however, LVB itself was not implicated as an accused. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate took cognizance of these offenses on September 17, 2020.6 6. On November 17, 2020, RBI imposed a moratorium7 on LVB in terms of Section 45(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 [hereafter “the Banking Act”]. On November 25, 2020, due to LVB’s unstable financial condition, the Central Government directed its non-voluntary amalgamation to DBS8. 7. On February 12, 2021, a supplementary chargesheet or final report was filed, to implead LVB, represented through its director, (now DBS Bank India Limited after amalgamation), as an accused9 along with bank officials and the companies RHC Holding and Ranchem. It was alleged that LVB and other accused parties conspired to siphon off funds that were lent, and belonged to RFL. LVB stood to make substantial profits from this lending, as it obtained the FDs at a 4.5% interest rate and then ostensibly lent the money at a rate of 10% p.a. Investigation revealed that LVB’s actions were based on the premise that RFL, RHC Holding, and Ranchem were group companies under the same promoters. LVB created security against FDs of RFL. However, proper authorization from RFL was not secured for this arrangement. The loans advanced by LVB to RHC Holding and Ranchem against FDs of RFL were ultimately utilized by RHC Holding. Consequently, 5 Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework is to enable Supervisory intervention at appropriate time and require the Supervised Entity to initiate and implement remedial measures in a timely manner, so as to restore its fi nancial health. The PCA Framework is also intended to act as a tool for eff ective market discipline. The PCA Framework does not preclude the Reserve Bank of India from taking any other action as it deems fi t at any time in addition to the corrective actions prescribed in the Framework.
