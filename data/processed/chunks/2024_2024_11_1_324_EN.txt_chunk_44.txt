Rejecting this submission, Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, speaking for himself and Justice PN Bhagwati held: “1. We have perused the judgement prepared by Brother Tulzapurkar with care but, with respect, we are unable to agree with him that the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 33 of 1976, does not further the Directive Principles of State Policy in clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39 of the 40 [2015] 13 SCR 1 : (2016) 5 SCC 1 : 2015 INSC 285 41 [1985] Supp. 1 SCR 862 : (1981) 1 SCC 166 : 1980 INSC 219 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 61 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. Constitution. The vice from which a provision here or a provision there of the impugned Act may be shown to suffer will not justify the conclusion that the Act is not intended to or does not, by its scheme, in fact implement or achieve the purpose of clause (b) and (c) of Article 39.”42 Justice Krishna Iyer, concurring with Chief Justice Chandrachud and Justice Bhagwati and thus forming a majority in Bhim Singh, held: “16-A. … The purpose of the enactment, garnered from the preamble, is to set a ceiling on vacant urban land, to take over the excess and to distribute it on a certain basis of priority. The whole story of the legislation, the long gestation of pre-legislative consideration, the brooding presence of Article 39(b) and (c) and the emphasis in Section 23(4) on common good as the guiding factor for distribution point to public purpose, national development and social justice as the cornerstone of the policy of distribution…”43 The decision in Bhim Singh was delivered after that in Minerva Mills. The majority opinions in Bhim Singh proceeded on the basis that the text of Article 31-C stood as it had prior to the Forty-Second Amendment to the Constitution. In other words, the judges began their analysis with the presumption that the Union could rely on Article 31-C and that the appropriate test under Article 31-C was whether the legislation in question furthered the principles set out in clauses (b) or (c) of Article 39. If the Court had adopted the present appellants’ interpretation of Article 31-C, they could not have proceeded on this basis because according to the appellants, references to clauses (b) or (c) of Article 39 are deemed to be omitted from Article 31-C after the Forty-Second Amendment and Minerva Mills. While the decision in Bhim Singh would fortify the position of the present respondents, the does not provide any rationale as to how and why the text of the unamended Article 31-C stood revived. 49. In Sanjeev Coke, a challenge was brought to various legislations including the Coking Coal Mines (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1971 which vested the management of coking coal mines and coke oven 42 Maharao Sahib Shri Bhim Singhji v Union of India 1981 (1) SCC 166 [1] (Chandrachud CJ). 43 Maharao Sahib Shri Bhim Singhji v Union of India 1981 (1) SCC 166 [16-A] (Krishna Iyer J).
