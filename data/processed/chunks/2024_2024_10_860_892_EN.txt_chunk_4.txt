It was contended that when the interest income of securities is uniformly assessed under the head “profits and gains from business or profession”, the decision of this Court in the case of Citi Bank NA3 will squarely apply.

It was submitted that, consequently, the related interest received would have to be excluded from the income and truncated from the purchase cost, or alternatively, both the broken interest period and interest received thereof will be netted and added/subtracted from the cost of acquisition. Therefore, the exercise done by 7 (1960) 39 ITR 114 : 1960 SCC OnLine SC 193 8 [1991] Supp. 2 SCR 312 : (1992) 193 ITR 321 : (1992) 1 SCC 659 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
