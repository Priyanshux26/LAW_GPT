We have already noted that in ‘Shri Gurudatta Sugars Marketing Pvt. Ltd.’ Case (supra) after referring to the earlier decisions of this Court including in ‘K.K. Ahuja v. V.K. Vohra and Another,2’ and in ‘N. Harihara Krishnan v. Godfather Travels and Tours P. Ltd.,3’ this Court held that the primary liability for an offence under Section 138 lies with the company and the company’s management is vicariously liable only under specific conditions provided in Section 141 and for the purpose of Section 143A of the NI Act and a signatory merely authorised to sign on behalf of the company would not become the ‘drawer’ of the cheque and, therefore, could not be directed to pay interim compensation under Section 143A. In the contextual situation, it is relevant to refer to paragraphs 28 to 30, 34 and 35 of ‘Shri Gurudatta Sugars Marketing Pvt. Ltd.’s case to the extent it is relevant for the purpose of this case, as under: - 2 [2009] 9 SCR 1144 : (2009) 10 SCC 48 3 (2018) 13 SCC 663 1898 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “28. The High Court’s interpretation of section 7 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 accurately identified the “drawer” as the individual who issues the cheque. This interpretation is fundamental to understanding the obligations and liabilities under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which makes it clear that the drawer must ensure sufficient funds in their account at the time the cheque is presented. The appellants’ argument that directors or other individuals should also be liable under Section 143A misinterprets the statutory language and intent. The primary liability, as correctly observed by the High Court, rests on the drawer, emphasizing the drawer’s responsibility for maintaining sufficient funds. 29. The general rule against vicarious liability in criminal law underscores that individuals are not typically held criminally liable for acts committed by others unless specific statutory provisions extend such liability. Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is one such provision, extending liability to the company’s officers for the dishonour of a cheque. The appellants’ attempt to extend this principle to section 143A, to hold directors or other individuals personally liable for interim compensation, is unfounded. The High Court rightly emphasized that liability under section 141 arises from the conduct or omission of the individual involved, not merely their position within the company. 30. The distinction between legal entities and individuals acting as authorized signatories is crucial. Authorized signatories act on behalf of the company but do not assume the company’s legal identity. This principle, fundamental to corporate law, ensures that while authorized signatories can bind the company through their actions, they do not merge their legal status with that of the company. This distinction supports the High Court’s interpretation that the drawer under section 143A refers specifically to the issuer of the cheque, not the authorized signatories. 34. The respondents correctly argued that an authorised signatory is not a drawer of the cheque, as established [2024] 10 S.C.R.
