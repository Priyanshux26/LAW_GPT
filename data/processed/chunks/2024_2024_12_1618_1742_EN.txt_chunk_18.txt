39. In the suit proceedings, on an application filed by the Subsequent Transferee the Civil Court, Belapur vide its dated 05.02.2024, directed that status quo be maintained and restrained the Bank from taking any steps towards obtaining the physical possession of the Secured Asset till it filed its written statement. 40. The DRT vide its dated 28.02.2024 observed that since the decision of this Court in the Civil Appeal Nos. 5542-5543 of 2023 had allowed the sale in favour of the petitioner, the act of the borrower to continue claiming a right to the Secured Asset on the strength of the Release Deed dated 28.08.2023 was highly deplorable. Accordingly, the DRT refused to grant stay of the notice of possession and dismissed the Borrower’s IA No. 456 of 2024 in S.A. No. 53 of 2024. 1644 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 41. The Borrower preferred an appeal against the aforesaid being Misc. Appeal (D) No. 429 of 2024 before the Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai (for short, the “DRAT”). It appears from the material on record that the DRAT vide its dated 29.02.2024 granted status quo and deferred the proceedings for physical possession, and further directed the Bank to deposit Rs. 129 crore paid by the Borrower before it, in contrast to the of this Court in Civil Appeal Nos. 5542-5543 of 2023 wherein the said amount was ed to be refunded in clear terms. 42. On 01.03.2024, the present contempt petition came to be filed before this Court seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the respondents for wilful disobedience of this Court’s in Civil Appeal Nos. 5542-5543 of 2023 and further praying for i) handing over of the physical possession and original title deeds to the Secured Asset, ii) annulment of the Release Deed, the No Dues Certificate and the Deed of Assignment in favour of the Subsequent Proceedings and iii) the quashing of all proceedings pending in respect of the Secured Asset before the DRT, DRAT and the suit proceedings of the Subsequent Transferee. 43. It further emerges from the materials on record that in the suit proceedings the Civil Court, Belapur vide its dated 05.03.2024 rejected the Bank’s application under VII, Rule 11 of the CPC and further extended the status quo granted earlier. 44. In the wake of such developments, the Bank on 12.03.2024 filed a miscellaneous application before this Court being M.A. No. 600 of 2024 in Civil Appeal Nos. 5542-5543 of 2023 seeking directions to the Borrower herein to handover the physical possession of the Secured Asset and all original title deeds related thereto in compliance of the decision of this Court in the Main Appeals. 45. The Borrower filed two applications in its Review Petitions that were pending before this Court being I.A. No. 92135 of 2024 and I.A. No. 92136 of 2024 in R.P.
