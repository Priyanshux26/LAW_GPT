Claim Nos.33 and 34. While holding so, the Arbitral Tribunal held that though termination with reference to Clause 60.1 was bad in law, but justified the termination with reference to Clause 17.4 of the Contract and consequently rejected the NBCC’s claim for refund of C two security deposits i.e. claim Nos.33 and 34. The Arbitral Tribunal also partly allowed Counter Claim No.3 in favour of IRCON. Counter Claim No.3 was relatable to the counter claim of IRCON for a total of Rs.3,65,38,806/- towards interest on various advances given to NBCC, more particularly, with regard to two specific advances being (1) Special Advance and (2) Advance against hypothecation of equipment.

The application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was confined to the aforesaid three claims / counter claims respectively viz. Claim Nos.33 and 34 and Counter Claim No.3 only. 2.4 By the and dated 03.03.2017, the learned Single F Judge of the High Court set aside the rejection by the learned Arbitral Tribunal of Claim Nos.33 and 34 of NBCC to the extent it concerned the return of security deposit amounts i.e. Rs.5,57,486/- + Rs.60,85,840/ - by observing and concluding that once the Arbitral Tribunal found that the termination with regard to Clause 60.1 was not justified, it was not open for the Arbitral Tribunal thereafter to consider the termination under G Clause 17.4 justifying forfeiture of the security deposits. The learned Single Judge of the High Court also set aside the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on Counter Claim No.3 by observing that there is no clause in the contract in particular awarding 18% interest per annum on special advance.
