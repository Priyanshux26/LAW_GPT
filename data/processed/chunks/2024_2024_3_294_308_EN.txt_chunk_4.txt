4577 of 2011 and 4583 of 2011 before this Court. 18. While entertaining the appeals, vide dated 13th May, 2011, this Court directed appellant-Suman L. Shah to deposit Rs.50 lakhs and appellant-Laxmichand Shah to deposit Rs. 25 lakhs with the Officer on Special Duty attached with the Special Court and to furnish a bank guarantee to the Custodian towards the balance amount, i.e., interest. 19. Both the appeals were dismissed by this Court vide dated 23rd April, 2012 on account of non-compliance of the dated 13th May, 2011. 20. The IAs seeking restoration of these Civil Appeals were accepted vide dated 14th March, 2014, subject to deposit of a total sum to the tune of Rs. 2.20 crores by the appellants with the Officer on Special Duty, Special Court. The amount has been deposited and accordingly the appeals were taken on board. 21. Learned counsel representing the appellants contended that the Special Court committed manifest error in facts as well as in law in holding that the appellants herein were the garnishees of respondent No. 2-Pallav Sheth. It was contended that the questionable transactions between the appellants and respondent Nos. 6, 7 and 8, the alleged benami companies of respondent No. 2-Pallav Sheth (notified party) and debtor of FFSL(notified party) were 13-14 years old and as no documentary proof relating to these transactions was provided by the Custodian on the record of the proceedings before the Special Court, the statement of appellants that the entire amounts of loan taken from respondent Nos. 6, 7 and 8 were repaid ought not to have been brushed aside. 22. It was contended that the appellants herein had taken the loans from respondent Nos. 6, 7 and 8 in the years 1996-1997, i.e., long before respondent No. 2-Pallav Sheth came to be notified under Section 3(2) of the Act of 1992, i.e., 6th October, 2001 and thus, the burden of proof regarding the existence of liability could not have been shifted on to the appellants and the onus essentially lay upon the Custodian to prove that these amounts had not been repaid and were still recoverable. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 301 Suman L. Shah v. The Custodian & Ors. 23. It was contended that the specific assertion made by the appellants in their deposition affidavits that the amounts in question borrowed from respondent Nos. 6, 7 and 8 had been repaid partly by cheque and partly by material supplied to these respondents could not be unsettled by the Custodian in crossexamination. Only a bald suggestion was given to the appellants in cross-examination that they did not have any document in the form of vouchers, receipts, invoices or entries in the book accounts to show the adjustment of the remaining amount. 24. It was urged that the letter dated 5th May, 1998 issued by respondent No. 3-Income Tax Department was referred to in the cross-examination of the appellants. However, the said letter was not proved by exhibiting the same in the proceeding before the Special Court.
