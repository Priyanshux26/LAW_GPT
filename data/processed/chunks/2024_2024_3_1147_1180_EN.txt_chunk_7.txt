7.3 The effect of the words must be tested from the standard of an “ordinary man of common sense and prudence”14, “reasonable, strong-minded, firm and courageous” person and not from the perspective of a hypersensitive person or a weak and vacillating 12 [1985] Suppl.. 3 SCR 17 : (1985) 4 SCC 289 : 1985 INSC 205 13 [1996] Suppl. 2 SCR 136 : (1996) 4 SCC 1 : 1996 INSC 595 14 K.A.

The terms used in the allegedly offending portions do not refer to any sexually explicit act and are not obscene as per the community standard test. Therefore, no offence of obscenity is made out under Section 67 of the IT Act. 7.4 Learned senior counsel has also argued that the scenes do not contain any sexually explicit act or conduct, as is required for an offence under Section 67A. Relying on various cases by this Court,16 they argue that the words in a penal provision must be strictly interpreted. The term ‘sexually explicit act or conduct’ does not cover profanities/ expletives/ swear words, even if the literal meaning of these terms refers to sexual acts. The literal meaning is not intended through the common usage of these words. Rather, they are an expression of emotions such as frustration, rage, and anger. 7.5 Learned senior counsel has also relied on the 50th Standing Committee Report on the 2006 Amendment Bill to the IT Act that introduced the provision, and various High Court decisions,17 to argue that the intention of Section 67A is to criminalise the publication and transmission of pornographic material that depicts sexual acts or contains sexually explicit conduct that falls short of actual depiction of sexual acts. Since the alleged segments in this case only contain expletives and do not contain any explicit visual or verbal depiction of sexual activity, there is no offence under Section 67A. 7.6 It is of course rightly argued that the right to freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a) protects artistic creativity and expression. 7.7 Lastly, the learned senior counsel has argued that a higher threshold of tolerance must apply in the present case as the web-series is a form of “pull media”. In pull media, the consumer 15 Ramesh s/o Chotalal Dalal v. Union of India [1988] 2 SCR 1011 : (1988) 1 SCC 668 : 1988 INSC 44 16 Sakshi v.
