We would hasten to observe that we are not commenting on the merits of the case either way. The observations B herein are only to indicate that the remand of the suit for trial de novo cannot be considered justified in the present case from any standpoint. 15. For what has been discussed hereinabove, suffice it would be to sum upthat for a few tentative observations about certain circumstances existing in favour of the plaintiff and certain other circumstances existing C in favour of the defendants and then,with another observation that plaintiff was a vital witness, the High Court was not justified in remanding the matter for trial de novo without recording any finding if the plaintiff was prevented from examining herself or from adducing any other evidence as also without explaining as to on what ground the decree was being reversed. D 16. Accordingly, and in view of the above, this appeal succeeds and is allowed. The impugned and dated 28.06.2019, insofar as relating to RFA No. 247 of 2014 (pertaining to OS No. 293 of 2012), is set aside; and the said appeal is restored for reconsideration by the High Court in accordance with law. The parties through their respective E counsel shall stand at notice to appear before the High Court on 20.03.2023. 17. Having regard to the circumstances, there shall be no as to costs of the present appeal. F Ankit Gyan Appeal allowed.
