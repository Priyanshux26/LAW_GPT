15. Taking note of the facts and circumstances of the case and legal position, the trial Court rightly observed that the subsequent sale deed cannot be construed as a principal transaction and the agreements to sell would be treated as the principal conveyance as per Explanation I of Article 25 of Schedule-I of the Act and impounded all these documents and directed to send the same to the Collector for adjudication of stamp duty and penalty. After, a detailed analysis, [2024] 9 S.C.R. 893 Shyamsundar Radheshyam Agrawal & Anr. v. Pushpabai Nilkanth Patil & Ors the High Court held that no case for interference was made out by the appellants, which, we affirm, to be correct. 16. In addition, we wish to further record that the second proviso to Article 25 only states that if the stamp duty is already paid or recovered on the agreement to sale, then the same shall be deducted while computing the stamp duty payable when the sale deed is executed; the proviso does not contemplate a situation similar to this case, where the document ought to have been registered with payment of stamp duty on the agreement for sale initially and only the balance, on the deed of sale after deduction of the duty already paid ought to have been collected. Since, the state cannot recover by way of stamp duty in excess of what it is entitled to, the recovery shall be restricted only to the extent of difference in stamp duty and the entire penalty from the date of execution of the agreement for sale till the date of payment of stamp duty. Needless to say, that until the defect is cured by satisfying the requirements under Section 34, the documents impounded cannot also be used in evidence. 17. In view thereof, we find no reason to interfere with the s passed by the Courts below. Accordingly, this appeal fails and is dismissed. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand closed. Result of the Case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
