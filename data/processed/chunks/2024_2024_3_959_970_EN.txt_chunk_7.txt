However, where an appeal, as provided under sub-section (2) of Section 6 is preferred, the same would come into operation only upon the expiry of seven days from the date on which copies of the of the appellate authority are sent. Section 10 of the said Act deals with the duration and modification of standing s. 20. It will also be relevant to refer to sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the said Act, which reads thus: “10. Duration and modification of standing s.- (3) The foregoing provisions of this Act shall apply in respect of an application under sub-section (2) as they apply to the certification of the first standing s.” 21. It could be seen from the perusal thereof that all foregoing provisions including the provision in Section 7 of the said Act would also apply in respect of the application under sub-section (2) as they apply to certification of the first Standing . As such, in view of the dated 03.03.2001 passed by the learned Industrial Tribunal, the amendment made in the year 1999 had not come into effect in view of the appeal being allowed by the learned Tribunal. 22. We therefore find that, on the date of the s of transfer as well as the date on which the learned Industrial Tribunal passed the award dated 28.02.2006, it is the 03.07.1989 Standing which would be in operation. More so when the appeal challenging the same by the respondents came to be dismissed on 06.04.1996 and which was not carried further by the respondents. 23. We further find that the learned Division Bench has also erred in not taking into consideration the law laid down by this Court in the 970 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports case of Cipla Ltd. (supra) though the said was specifically cited before it. 24. In the result, the impugned and is quashed and set aside. Writ Appeal No. 877 of 2006 filed by the respondent No.1 is dismissed. The dated 20.03.2006 passed by the learned single judge in Writ Petition No. 44810 of 2001 is upheld. Writ Petition No.31808/2003 filed by the respondent No.1 is dismissed. Writ Petition No.7993/2006 filed by the appellant is allowed. The passed by the learned Tribunal dated 28.02.2006 is quashed and set aside. However, we clarify that we have not considered the larger issue with regard to the powers of the Certifying Officer to provide a clause in the Standing s, reserving the power of the employer to transfer its employees anywhere in India. 25. In our view, in view of the law laid down by this Court in the case of Cipla Ltd. (supra), it was not necessary for the Division Bench to go into the said issue, inasmuch as the facts of the case at hand, are squarely covered by Cipla Ltd. (supra). 26. The appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid terms. There shall be no s as to costs. 27. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
