[Paras 60, 70, 71] Railways Act, 1989 – Whether, the claim towards the refund of difference of 110 km in freight charges is covered by Section 106 sub-section (3) of the Railways Act, 1989; In other words, whether the claim is for a refund of an ‘overcharge’: Held: The respondent company has undisputedly paid the freight charges as per the notified chargeable distance, and nothing more has been charged than what was at the time of booking of the consignment required to be charged as per the law prevailing i.e., as per the old local distance table – The case of the respondent company is not that it has paid anything in excess of what was at the time of booking of the consignment required by law, rather, the respondent’s case is that the charge which was required to be paid by the law as prevailing at the time of booking of the consignment was wrong – In other words, the respondent’s case is that the very chargeable distance of 444 km as per the old local distance table was wrong, and not that the distance for which the respondent has been charged is incorrect in terms of the chargeable distance that was notified at that time – Since admittedly, what was charged from the respondent was as per the chargeable 1054 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports distance notified and required to be payable by law at that time with nothing in excess, and since the respondent has challenged the very basis or genus of the charge i.e., primary challenge is to the chargeable distance of 444 km in itself and not the incidental quantum of freight levied on the distance of 444 km, and because the same was admittedly charged as per the prevailing law and not due to any misapplication or mistake i.e., as per the old local distance table, this clearly is not a case of overcharge and would not fall within the four corners of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989. [Paras 104, 105, 107] Railways Act, 1989 – Whether the notified chargeable distance of ‘444 km’ was an Illegal Charge or not? Held: In the instant case, prima-facie it appears that under both; the Old Distance Table and the New Distance Table, the actual engineering difference was being taken into consideration, and the only difference between the two methodologies lies in the rounding- off – The effect of the change in methodology on the chargeable distance would not have resulted in a huge difference of 110 km – There had been neither any change in the route by way of addition of new station nor change in the physical track length of the said route – The letter dated 05.07.2005 itself indicates that the change in the chargeable distance of 444 km was due to an error, and has no bearing with the Ministry of Railway’s letter dated 07.04.2004 introducing the new methodology – There was failure of the appellant in establishing that the chargeable distance of 444 km was the correct chargeable distance as per the law – There is a concurrent findings of both, the Railway Claims Tribunal and the High Court on the limited aspect of the actual distance being 333.18 km – Thus, the said chargeable distance of 444 km was illegal – No infirmity in the and passed by the High Court.
