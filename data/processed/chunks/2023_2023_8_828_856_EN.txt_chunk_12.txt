vs. K.G. Madhavan Pillai & Ors.9. In the aforesaid case, the government had 2 [1982] AC 617 G 3 [1990] 1 WLR 1545 4 [1969] 2 WLR 337 5 [1983] 2 AC 237 6 [1984] 3 WLR 1174 7 [2001] Q.B. 213 8 [2005] EWCA Civ 1363 9 (1988) 4 SCC 669 H 844 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A issued a sanction in favour of the respondent therein to open a new school and to upgrade certain already existing schools. However, subsequent to the abovementioned sanction, a new direction was given by the government to keep the said sanction in abeyance. This Court, while deciding the said issue, was of the opinion that the original sanction given by the government gave rise to a legitimate expectation in the B minds of the respondents. This legitimate expectation was however breached by the subsequent direction for abeyance, and hence there was a violation of the principles of natural justice. The relevant observations in this regard from the said are being reproduced hereunder: C “…In other words once the Government approves an application for opening a new unaided school or a higher class in an existing unaided school and passes an under Rule 2-A(5), then the successful applicant acquires a right of legitimate expectation to have his application further D considered under Rules 9 and 11 for the issue of a sanction under Rule 11 for opening a new school or upgrading an existing school. It is no doubt true, as pointed out by the Division Bench, that by the mere grant of an approval under Rule 2-A(5), an applicant will not acquire a right to open a new school or to upgrade an existing school but he certainly E acquires a right enforceable in law to have his application taken to the next stage of consideration under Rule 11. The Division Bench was therefore, right in taking the view that the general power of rescindment available to the State Government under Section 20 of the Kerala General Clauses F Act has to be determined in the light of the “subject matter, context and the effect of the relevant provisions of the statute”. 22. In Navjyoti Coop. Group Housing Society & Ors. vs. Union Of India & Ors.10, the original policy for allotment of land to housing societies therein was based on the principle of seniority, and seniority G under the said policy was decided on the basis of the date of registration. Subsequently, a change was made to the original policy, wherein the criteria for deciding seniority was changed from the date of registration to the date of approval of the final list. The said deviation from the original policy was challenged on the touchstone of legitimate expectation H 10 (1992) 4 SCC 477 M/S. K.B. TEA PRODUCT PVT. LTD. v. COMMERCIAL TAX 845 OFFICER, SILIGURI [KRISHNA MURARI, J.] by the petitioners therein. This Court, while deciding on the said challenge, A held that the original policy, as well as the past practice of allotting land, gave rise to a legitimate expectation to the parties therein of a predictable pattern of allotment, and the new change in policy broke such legitimate expectation.
