Significantly in B.R. Enterprises v. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 843 K. Arumugam v. Union of India & Others Etc. State of U.P. [(1999) 9 SCC 700] construing H. Anraj [(1986) 1 SCC 414 : 1986 SCC (Tax) 190] the Court said: (SCC p. 746, para 52) “52. So, we find three ingredients in the sale of lottery tickets, namely, (i) prize, (ii) chance, and (iii) consideration. So, when one purchases a lottery ticket, he purchases for a prize, which is by chance and the consideration is the price of the ticket.” xxx 51. We are therefore of the view that the decision in H. Anraj [(1986) 1 SCC 414 : 1986 SCC (Tax) 190] incorrectly held that a sale of a lottery ticket involved a sale of goods. There was no sale of goods within the meaning of Sales Tax Acts of the different States but at the highest a transfer of an actionable claim. The decision to the extent that it held otherwise is accordingly overruled though prospectively with effect from the date of this .” 6.8 On a reading of clause (19) of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994 and on analyzing the same, it is evident that tax on a business auxiliary service is relatable to (i) any service concerning promotion or marketing or sale of goods, produced or provided by, or belonging to the client and (ii) promotion or marketing of service provided by the client. 6.9 The definition of goods has also been noted in clause (50) of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994 which refers to clause (7) of Section 2 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. The expression “goods” under the Sale of Goods Act expressly excludes actionable claims as well as money. This Court in Sunrise Associates has held that lottery tickets are actionable claims. Therefore, as lottery tickets would not come within the meaning of the expression goods under clause (7) of Section 2 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, they would also not come within the scope and ambit of clause (50) of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994. If that is so, they would also not come within the scope and ambit of clause (19)(i) of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994. Lottery tickets being actionable claims and not being goods within the meaning 844 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of sub-clause (i) of clause (19) of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994, would expressly get excluded from the scope of the said provision. In the circumstances, service tax on the promotion or marketing or sale of lottery tickets which are actionable claims could not have been levied under the said sub-clause. 6.10 In to remove the doubt whether service tax could be levied on promotion or marketing or sale of lottery tickets under Clause 19(ii) of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994, an Explanation was added with effect from 16.05.2008. The Explanation has also been extracted above. Although the Explanation is for the purpose of removal of doubts, it is relevant to note that what is excluded in sub-clause (i) of clause (19) of Section 65 of the Act, namely lotteries being actionable claim and not goods, as analysed above, is sought to be mentioned as lottery per se in the Explanation.
