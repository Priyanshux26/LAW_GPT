The deviation from the tender route B has to be justified and such a justification must comply with the requirements of Article 14. [Paras 20, 21, 22][492-G-H; 493-A- C-E] M/s Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, (1980) 4 SCC 1:[1980] 3 SCR 1338; C Sachidanand Pandey v. State of West Bengal 1987 (2) SCC 295 : [1987] 2 SCR 223; Haji T.M Hassam Rawther v. Kerala Financial Corporation (1988) 1 SCC 166 : [1988] 1 SCR 1079; Centre for Public Interest Litigation v.

Union of India (2009) 7 SCC 561 : [2009] 9 SCR 225; Nagar Nigam v. Al Farheem Meat Exporters (P) Ltd. E (2006) 13 SCC 382 : [2006] 10 Suppl. SCR 354 – relied on. 3. There is no material on record to support the submission that IMPCL is the only establishment among the establishments mentioned in paragraph 4(vi)(a) that manufacture good quality F Ayurvedic drugs. In fact, paragraph 4(vi)(b) states that 50 percent of the grant-in-aid shall be used to purchase medicines from the units mentioned in the paragraph “keeping in view the need for ensuring quality of AYUSH drugs and medicines.” This would indicate that the need for ensuring quality is subserved by all the G sources mentioned there. Besides IMPCL, which is an establishment of the Government of India, paragraph 4(vi)(b) includes other establishments of the State Governments or co- operative societies. The contention that IMPCL does not have any commercial interest because it is an establishment developed H by the Government of India is then equally applicable to other M/S IMPCL v. KERALA AYURVEDIC CO OPERATIVE SOCIETY LTD. 477 & ORS. establishments prescribed in paragraph 4(vi)(b). The argument A that the procurement of Ayurvedic drugs from IMPCL would fall within the exceptional circumstances (assurance of quality medicines) is erroneous. The submission of the appellant that IMPCL is the sole producer of quality Ayurvedic medicines is based on surmises and conjectures without any cogent material B to support the claim. In fact, the notification of 2 January 2019 issued by the Ministry of AYUSH stipulates that 50 percent of the grant-in-aid has to be used to procure medicines from IMPCL or other Central/State PSUs’ or pharmacies under the State- Governments and co-operatives. It is open to the appellant to C procure medicines using any method other than tender, so long as it is not arbitrary. The claim of the appellant is that it deviated from the rule of tender because IMPCL is the only establishment that produces quality medicines. However, there is no material to substantiate the claim that IMPCL is the only establishment D which manufactures ‘quality’ medicines to the exclusion of other establishments mentioned in paragraph 4(vi)(b). The appellant has been unable to discharge the burden placed on it by producing cogent material demonstrating that the procurement of medicines through nomination is warranted because of the existence of E exceptional circumstances bearing on need for quality.
