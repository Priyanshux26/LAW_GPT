(11) Where the prosecution proves that the accused had the intention to cause death of any person or to cause bodily H 1096 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A injury to him and the intended injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, then, even if he inflicts a single injury which results in the death of the victim, the offence squarely falls under Clause thirdly of Section 300 of the IPC unless one of the exceptions applies. B (12) In determining the question, whether an accused had guilty intention or guilty knowledge in a case where only a single injury is inflicted by him and that injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the fact that the act is done without premeditation in a sudden fight or quarrel, or that the circumstances justify that the injury was accidental or C unintentional, or that he only intended a simple injury, would lead to the inference of guilty knowledge, and the offence would be one under Section 304 Part II of the IPC. [Para 60][1127-H; 1128-A-H; 1129-A-H; 1130-A-H; 1131-A-D] 2. Looking at the overall evidence on record, it is difficult D to come to the conclusion that when the appellant struck the deceased with the weapon of offence, he intended to cause such bodily injury as was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The weapon of offence in the present case is a common agriculture tool. If a man is hit with a weed axe on the E head with sufficient force, it is bound to cause, as here, death. It is true that the injuries shown in the post mortem report are fracture of the parietal bone as well as the temporal bone. The deceased died on account of the cerebral compression i.e. internal head injuries. However, the moot question is – whether that by itself is sufficient to draw an inference that the appellant intended F to cause such bodily injury as was sufficient to cause death. This Court is of the view that the appellant could only be attributed with the knowledge that it was likely to cause an injury which was likely to cause the death. It is in such circumstances that this Court inclined to take the view that the case on hand does G not fall within clause thirdly of Section 300 of the IPC. [Para 62][1131-G-H; 1132-A-B] Tholan v.
