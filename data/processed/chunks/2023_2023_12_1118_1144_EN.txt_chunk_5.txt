8. The respondents in the rejoinder had contended that due to the Covid pandemic, the period of limitation was suspended during the period from 15.03.2020 to 28.02.2022 by this Court in terms of the directions issued in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020, and hence, the claim of the respondents was within the period of limitation. In the communication/ letter dated 27.04.2017, intimating the purported increase in the sale area, the appellant had not placed any material or evidence to justify the increase in the area. They allege that the reports and certifi cates of the architects are all post-dated records, which cannot be taken as the basis for justifying the increase in the sale area. 9. The National Commission, as stated herein above, by the impugned has directed the appellant to refund the amount and execute 1126 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. supplementary/correction deeds. The appellant being aggrieved by the same, has preferred the present appeal. 10. Heard the learned Senior Advocates Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Mr. Amit Sibal appearing for the appellant, and the learned Senior Advocate Mr. Bishwajit Bhattacharyya appearing for the respondents. 11. At the outset, we must record our disagreement with the fi nding recorded by the National Commission as to the ‘continuing cause of action’ till 26.08.2020, which is the date when the question of the excess sale area was decided by the National Commission in CC Nos. 285/2018 and 286/2018 titled Pawan Gupta v. Experion Developers Private Limited. The issue of limitation has to be decided as per the provisions in the enactment, in the instant case Section 697 of the Act, which prescribes a two years limitation to fi le a complaint from the date on which the ‘cause of action’ has arisen. The ‘cause of action’ means every fact, which, if traversed, is necessary to prove in to support the claimant’s right to , is not dependant on a decision in another case by an allottee raising a similar issue. 12. As per the respondents, the ‘cause of action’ arose when the payments towards the increase in the sale area were made, and thereupon, the conveyance deeds were executed between April 2018 to September 2019. They also submit, on account of the Covid pandemic, the period from 15.03.2020 to 28.02.2022 has to be excluded in terms of the directions issued by this Court in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020. Since the complaints were made on 25.02.2022, and on exclusion of the period between 15.03.2020 to 28.02.2022, the complaints would be well within the limitation of two years from the date on which the ‘cause of action’ had arisen as prescribed in Section 69 of the Act. 7 69. Limitation period.—(1) The District Commission, the State Commission or the National Commission shall not admit a complaint unless it is fi led within two years from the date on which the cause of action has arisen. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), a complaint may be entertained after the period specifi ed in sub-section (1), if the complainant satisfi es the District Commission, the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, that he had suffi cient cause for not fi ling the complaint within such period: Provided that no such complaint shall be entertained unless the District Commission or the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, records its reasons for condoning such delay.
