It was further held that it is only on the basis of such pleading and proof that the Court would be in a position to form an opinion and record a finding that such breach or non-compliance has materially affected the result of the election before election of the returned candidate could be declared void. It was further observed that mere non-compliance or breach of the Constitution or the statutory provisions, as stated above, would not result in invalidating the election of the returned candidate under Section 100 (1)(d)(iv) as the sine qua non for declaring the election of a returned candidate to be void on that ground under clause (iv) of Section 100 (1)(d) is further 20 [2012] 1 SCR 527 : (2012) 3 SCC 314 424 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports proof of the fact that such breach or non-observance has resulted in materially affecting the election of the returned candidate. For the election petitioner to succeed on such ground, viz., Section 100 (1) (d)(iv), he has not only to plead and prove the breach but also show that the result of the election, insofar as it concerned the returned candidate, has been materially affected thereby. 47. In L.R. Shivaramagowda and others vs. T.M. Chandrashekar (Dead) by LRs and others21, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court pointed out that in to declare an election void under Section 100(1) (d)(iv) of the Act of 1951, it is absolutely necessary for the election petitioner to plead that the result of the election, insofar as it concerned the returned candidate, has been materially affected by the alleged non-compliance with the provisions of the Constitution or the Act of 1951 or the rules or s made thereunder and the failure to plead such material facts would be fatal to the election petition. 48. However, perusal of the election petition filed by Nuney Tayang reflects that the only statement made by him in this regard is in Paragraph 21 and it reads as follows: ‘……Hence, his nomination papers suffer from substantial and material defects. As such, the result of the election, insofar as the respondent No.1 is concerned, is materially affected by the improper acceptance of his nomination as well as by the non-compliance with the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and the rules and s made thereunder, including Section 33(1) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, Rule 4A of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 and the s made thereunder…...’ Again, in his ‘Ground No. (ii)’, Nuney Tayang stated as under: ‘…….As such, the nomination papers of the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were improperly accepted by the Returning Officer and the result of the election in question, insofar as it concerns the respondent No.1 the return candidate, as well as the respondent No.2, has been materially affected by such improper acceptance of their nominations……’ 21 [1998] Supp. 3 SCR 241 : (1999) 1 SCC 666 [2024] 4 S.C.R. 425 Karikho Kri v. Nuney Tayang and Another Though there are some general references to non-compliance with particular provisions of the Act of 1951 and the rules made thereunder, we do not find adequate pleadings or proof to substantiate and satisfy the requirements of Section 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act of 1951.
