Dismissing the appeal, the Court HELD: 1.1 By Tamil Nadu Amendment Act, 2012, Section 17(1)(g) has been inserted and “explanation” to Section 17(2) G has been omitted. Thus, on and after the Tamil Nadu Amendment Act, 2012, as per Section 17(1)(g), instrument of agreement relating to sale of immovable property of the value of Rs.100/- and upwards is required to be registered compulsorily. However, despite the same and despite the “explanation” to sub-section (2) of Section 17 has been omitted, there is no corresponding H 834 R. HEMALATHA v. KASHTHURI 835 amendment made to Section 49 of the Registration Act. Thus, as A per proviso to Section 49, an unregistered document affecting the immovable property and required by Registration Act to be registered may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter-II of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, or as evidence of any collateral transaction not required to B be effected by registered document.
