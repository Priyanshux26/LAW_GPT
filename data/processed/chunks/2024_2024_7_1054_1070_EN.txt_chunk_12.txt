It would run counter to the very grain of our constitutional jurisprudence. In any view of the matter, K.A. Najeeb (supra) being rendered by a three Judge Bench is binding on a Bench of two Judges like us. 33. Thus, having regard to the discussions made above, we are of the considered view that continued incarceration of the appellant cannot be justified. We are, therefore, inclined to grant bail to the appellant. 34. Consequently, we pass the following : - (i) The impugned dated 03.04.2023 of the High Court is set aside and quashed; (ii) Appellant is directed to be released on bail subject to fulfilment of the following conditions: - (a) Trial court shall impound the passport and/or citizenship document(s) of the appellant. If those are in the custody of the prosecution, those shall be handed over to the trial court. (b) Appellant shall not leave the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court; he shall furnish his address to the trial court. (c) He shall appear before the trial court on each and every date of the trial. (d) In addition to the above, the appellant shall mark his attendance before the police station which the trial court may indicate once in every fortnight till conclusion of the trial. (e) He shall not tamper with the evidence and shall not threaten the witnesses. (iii) If there is any violation of the bail conditions as above, it would be open to the prosecution to move the trial court for cancellation of bail. 35. The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
