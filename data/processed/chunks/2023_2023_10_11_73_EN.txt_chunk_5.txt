Admittedly, A-4 was subordinate to both PW-16 and A-3.The competent authority refused to grant sanction to prosecute A-3 and A-4 for the offences under the PC Act. The trial court and the G High Court did not find A-4 as a co-conspirator, which is why he was not held guilty of the offence under Section 120-B IPC. Section 193 IPC had been included completely out of context. The H 18 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A conviction of A-4 by the trial court as confirmed by the High Court is wholly unsustainable and is liable to be set aside. [Paras 113- 115][68-C-E] 4.7 Three out of four bank officials examined by the prosecution to show that A-7 applied for demand drafts on behalf B of four bogus firms, did not identify A-7 as the person who applied for the demand drafts. They did not also identify the handwriting in Exhibits P-66, P-90 and P- 92 as that of A-7. The only person who stated something in favour of the prosecution was PW-32 and it was in relation to Exhibit P-76. [Para 122][69-H; 70-A] C 4.8 There was a colossal failure on the part of the prosecution to establish that Exhibits P-66, P-76, P-90 and P-92 were in the handwritings/signatures of A-7. This is despite the prosecution examining the bank officials as PW-22, PW-32, PW- 40 and PW-41 and the handwriting expert as PW-30. [Para 128][71-A] D 4.9 Unfortunately, the trial court adopted a very curious reasoning that since he was a beneficiary of the money diverted to the account of sister concern, he must have had participation and knowledge that the demand drafts were purchased to cheat PSU. Such a reasoning is wholly unacceptable in view of the fact E that A-7 was accused of forgery and charged u/s. 468 IPC, in relation to these very same applications for demand drafts. Therefore, it was necessary for the prosecution to prove forgery and also to show that the purpose of such forgery was cheating. Both were absent. The High Court fortunately realised the pitfall in the reasoning of the trial court. But in an over-anxiety to F somehow convict A-7, the High Court adopted a very peculiar route, namely that of undertaking the task of comparing the admitted signatures/ handwritings with the disputed ones u/s. 73 of the Evidence Act. [Paras 129, 130][71-B-E] 4.10 There was no signature or writing available before the G High Court, which had been admitted or proved to the satisfaction of the Court to have been written or made. The High Court did not also direct A-7 to write any words or figures for the purpose of enabling a comparison. Without following the procedure so H A. SRINIVASULU v. THE STATE REP. BY THE INSPECTOR OF 19 POLICE prescribed in Section 73, the High Court invented a novel A procedure, to uphold the conviction handed over by the trial court through a wrong reasoning. Even in the questioning under Section 313 of the Code, no specific question was put to A-7 whether Exhibits P-66, P-76, P-90, P-92 and P- 75 were in his handwritings and whether they contained his signatures.
