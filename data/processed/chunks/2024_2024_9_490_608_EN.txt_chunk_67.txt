In holding so, Tribunal relied on: (a) an e-mail sent by the claimant on 21 September 2015 showing its readiness to a performance guarantee test; and (b) the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that the certificates on completion, as ought to have been issued, should not have been issued on or before 21 September 2015.104 The Tribunal also took note of the terms and conditions of the contract which were to the effect that the performance guarantee test can be deemed satisfactory if, despite request, it is not carried out within 180 days of the issue of the taking over certificate. The Tribunal noticed that vide certificate dated 2 March 2017 the appellant(s) admitted that unit was commissioned in May 2015 and there was a request of the claimant dated 21 September 2015 to undertake performance guarantee test.105 Taking all of this into account, the Tribunal held that the “deemed achievement of supplier’s liability in respect to performance guarantee”, pursuant to clause 10.5 of Annexure A of the Erection Purchase , became effective on 19 March 2016.106 104. From the discussion thus far, following dates emerge which, in our view, would be relevant for determining the start point of limitation for the claim: (a) 21 September 2015 i.e., the deemed date of completion of the supply/ work undertaken by the claimant under the Purchase s/ contract; and 101 Paragraph 13.08 (c) of the Award 102 Paragraph 7.32 of the Award 103 Paragraph 13.13 (d) of the Award 104 Paragraph 13.13 (h) of the Award. 105 See Paragraph 88 (16) above including paragraph 13.13 (f) of the Award. 106 Paragraph 13.13 (i) of the Award. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 585 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. (b) 19 March 2016 i.e., the deemed date by which the supplier (Claimant) had fulfilled its liability under the contract relating to guaranteed performance of the Unit concerned. 105. Now, we shall consider whether Articles 14 and 18 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act were applicable or not. Article 14 applies where the suit is for the price of the goods sold and delivered, and there is no fixed period of credit agreed upon. Here, there is an indivisible claim in respect of the outstanding principal amount for the goods supplied and the work done. Moreover, the payment(s) under the supply purchase were to be on pro rata basis, and full payment for the supplies was dependent on supporting documents, including certificates, to be provided by the purchaser, which were not provided. Thus, when full payment(s) under the supply/erection purchase (s) were dependent on certificates relating to completion/ commissioning /guaranteed performance etc., the claimant waited till successful completion / commissioning / guaranteed performance of the project to file a composite claim for the balance amount payable under both the purchase s. In our view, therefore, Article 14 is not applicable to the claim as framed. 106. Insofar as Article 18 is concerned, it is to apply where the suit is for the price of the work done by the plaintiff for the defendant at his request, and where no time has been fixed for payment.
