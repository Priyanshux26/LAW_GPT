17. Section 83 of the 1951 Act mandates that an election petition must contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the 14 [2008] 14 SCR 621 : (2008) 17 SCC 491, paragraphs 13 and 17 15 [2008] 16 SCR 1117 : (2009) 1 SCC 354, paragraph 29 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 69 Sheikh Noorul Hassan v. Nahakpam Indrajit Singh & Ors. petitioner relies. Additionally, an election petition should set forth full particulars of any corrupt practice that the petitioner alleges, including as full a statement as possible of the names of the parties alleged to have committed such corrupt practice and the date and place of the commission of each such practice. Since, an election petition is to be dismissed under sub-section (1) of Section 86 if not filed within the time specified in Section 81, such material facts and particulars as to commission of corrupt practice are required to be given in the election petition and not in the replication filed much after the expiry of the period of limitation for filing election petition. The material facts and particulars alleged for the first time in the replication and not forming part of the averment made in the election petition cannot be tried and cannot be made the subject matter of issues framed by the court (See Jeet Mohinder Singh v. Harminder Singh Jassi16). 18. Though the High Court while dealing with an election petition exercises powers under the CPC, those powers are subject to the provisions of the 1951 Act and of any rules made thereunder. In consequence, the general power of amendment of a pleading or of grant of leave to file replication, as is otherwise available to a Court under VI Rule 17 and VIII Rule 9 of the CPC, is limited by the provisions of the 1951 Act and the rules made thereunder. For example, sub-section (5) of Section 86 of the 1951 Act provides that the High Court may allow the particulars of any corrupt practice alleged in the petition to be amended or amplified in such manner as may, in its opinion, be necessary for ensuring a fair and effective trial of the petition, but it shall not allow any amendment of the petition which will have the effect of introducing particulars of a corrupt practice not previously alleged in the petition. The significance of sub-section (5) of Section 86 of the 1951 Act has been considered by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in F.A. Sapa and others v. Singora and others17 in the following terms: “19. …….Section 86 (5) as it presently stands empowers the High Court to allow the ‘particulars’ of any corrupt practice alleged in the petition to be amended or amplified provided the amendment does not have the effect of 16 [1999] Supp. 4 SCR 33 : (1999) 9 SCC 386, paragraph 45 17 [1991] 2 SCR 752 : (1991) 3 SCC 375 70 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports widening the scope of the election petition by introducing particulars in regard to a corrupt practice not previously alleged or pleaded within the period of limitation in the election petition.
