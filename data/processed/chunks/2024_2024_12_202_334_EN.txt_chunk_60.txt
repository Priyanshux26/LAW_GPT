Section 5 empowers the customs officer to discharge the duties of proper officer so conferred. Even prior to the amendment to Sections 2(34) and 5, this could be the only understanding with respect to the question of entrustment of functions of the proper officer to a customs officer. 129. In our view, the assignment of functions of proper officers as mentioned in Section 2(34) and entrustment of functions of customs officers as mentioned in Section 6 operate on different planes. The assignment of functions of the proper officer is to be done only to officers of customs (whether they be appointed under Section 4 or entrusted with certain functions under Section 6). There may be some overlap between the assignment of functions of proper officers under Section 2(34) read with Section 5 and the entrustment of functions of officers of customs under Section 6 in some instances but there can be no scenario in which we can hold that the “functions” under Section 6 and Section 2(34) are congruent. 130. One of the bases for the decision in Canon India (supra) was that no entrustment of functions under Section 6 was done in favour of the DRI officers. This, however, is a glaring misapplication of Section 6 of the Act and is in ignorance of the applicable law which is in fact Sections 2(34) read with Section 5 of the Act, 1962. Therefore, in light 296 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the of this Court in Yashwant Sinha (supra), we find that it is necessary to allow this review petition to do complete justice. ix. Observations on the constitutional validity of Section 28(11) of the Act, 1962 131. The question as to who are the “proper officers” for the purpose of issuance of show cause notices under Section 28 was raised before the High Court of Delhi in the case of Mangali Impex (supra). The specific challenge therein was to the constitutional validity of Section 28(11) of the Act which was inserted by the Customs (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2011 (the “Validation Act”) with effect from 16.09.2011. 132. A Division Bench of the High Court held that sub-section (11) of Section 28 could not validate the show cause notices issued by the DRI officers prior to 08.04.2011, i.e., the date when Section 28 was amended. 133. With a view to understanding the true purport of Section 28(11) and the issues pertaining thereto, it is necessary to first examine the changes to Section 28 that were introduced prior to the Validation Act. Section 28 as it stood prior to the Finance Bill 2011 is reproduced below: “28. Notice for payment of duties, interest, etc. (1) When any duty has not been levied or has been short-levied or erroneously refunded, or when any interest payable has not been paid, part paid or erroneously refunded, the proper officer may,- (a) in the case of any import made by any individual for his personal use or by government or by any educational, research or charitable institution or hospital, within one year; (b) in any other case, within six months, from the relevant date, serve notice on the person chargeable with the duty or interest which has not been levied or charged or which has been short-levied or part paid or to whom the refund has erroneously been made, requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amount specified in the notice: [2024] 12 S.C.R.
