In this regard, the four-judge bench in Ashok Kumar Yadav v. State of Haryana36, discussed the threshold for invalidating the entire selection process as under: “21. …But suspicion cannot take the place of proof and we cannot strike down the selections made on the ground that the evaluation of the merits of the candidates in the viva voce examination might be arbitrary. It is necessary to point out that the Court cannot sit in over the marks awarded by interviewing bodies unless it is proved or obvious that the marking is plainly and indubitably arbitrary or affected by oblique motives. It is only if the assessment is patently arbitrary or the risk of arbitrariness is so high that a reasonable person would regard arbitrariness as inevitable, that the assessment of marks at the viva voce test may be regarded as suffering from the vice of arbitrariness.” 70. Guided by the above principle, the steps taken by the High Court after the issuance of advertisement as mentioned in the additional affidavit of Patna High Court summarized below, would bear consideration. i) The preliminary examination was held on 22.3.2015. 6,771 candidates appeared for the same. ii) The main exam was held on 12.7.2015 and over 1000 candidates appeared for the same. iii) The affidavit notes that only 15 candidates obtained qualifying marks in the written exam i.e. above 55%. However, Mr. Gautam 35 K.H. Siraj v. High Court of Kerala (2006) 6 SCC 395; Inderpreet Singh Kahlon v. State of Punjab (2006) 11 SCC 356 36 [1985] Supp. 1 SCR 657 : (1985) 4 SCC 417 578 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Narayan, learned counsel for the Patna High Court has clarified that this is a typographical error and only 3 candidates had, in fact, obtained qualifying marks. This is in consonance with the RTI Reply dated 10.2.2017. iv) In to fill up vacancies, the Selection and Appointment Committee of the High Court examined 20 answer sheets of each paper at random. It was decided that there was a need for moderation. Accordingly, the Selection and Appointment Committee comprising of 5 judges of the High Court in its meeting dated 8.1.2016 proposed for moderation by adding 4% marks in Paper I & 6% marks in Paper II. v) Despite moderation, only few candidates secured above 55% marks in aggregate. Thereafter, the Full Court decided to permit relaxation of 5% in the aggregate marks under proviso to Clause 10 of Appendix C of the 1951 Rules. vi) After relaxation of marks to 50%, 81 candidates were found qualified in the written examination and results were uploaded on 22.1.2016. vii) The interviews for those who scored 50% in the written, were conducted on 19.2.2016, 20.2.2016,22.2.2016 and 23.2.2016 by a Board of 5 judges of the High Court. Eventually, only 9 candidates could secure 10 marks or more out of 50 total marks in the interview. The said 9 persons upon Full Court approval were appointed by the Bihar Government on 17.5.2016. 71.
