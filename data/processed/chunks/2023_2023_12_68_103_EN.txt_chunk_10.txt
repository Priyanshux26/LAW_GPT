84 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 13. Procedure for election disputes. – The procedure provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, Samvat 1977 in regard to suits shall be followed by the authori-ty appointed under section 12 as far as it can be made applicable in the trial and disposal of an election petition under this Act.” 16. It requires no reiteration that the powers of this Court and the High Courts vested under the Constitution cannot be abridged, excluded or taken away, being part of the Basic Structure of our Constitution. Reference need only be made to decisions in His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru v State of Kerala, (1973) 4 SCC 225; Indira Nehru Gandhi v Raj Narain,1975 Supp SCC 1;Minerva Mills Ltd. v Union of India, (1980) 3 SCC 625; L Chandra Kumar v Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261 and more recently, to Kalpana Mehta v Union of India, (2018) 7 SCC 1 and Rojer Mathew v South Indian Bank Limited,(2020) 6 SCC 1, all of which were rendered by a Bench of 5 or more learned Judges. Section 12 of the 1997 Act need not detain us. Insofar as Section 13 of the 1997 Act is concerned, it is by now too well-settled that the availability of alternative effi cacious remedy is no bar to the exercise of high prerogative writ jurisdiction, in the light of various decisions, including but not limited to, State of Uttar Pradesh v Mohammad Nooh, 1958 SCR 595; Madhya Pradesh State Agro Industries Development Corporation Ltd. v Jahan Khan, (2007) 10 SCC 88; Maharashtra Chess Association v Union of India, (2020) 13 SCC 285. Even on the anvil of Radha Krishan Industries v State of Himachal Pradesh, (2021) 6 SCC 771, Section 13 of the 1997 Act does not, and cannot, impede a Constitutional Court from proceeding further. We do not wish to multiply established authorities on the point but would add the very recent Godrej Sara Lee Ltd. v Excise and Taxation Offi cer-cum-Assessing Authority, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 95 to the list enumerated above. 17. At the threshold, it is noted that the ECI deals with the conduct of elections to the Parliament, the State Legislative Assemblies and the State Legislative Councils. The Union Territory of Ladakh does not currently have a Legislative Assembly. The last election to the Parliamentary constituency was held in the year 2019. That said, fi rst things fi rst. The Legal Opinion by the Law Department remains internal advice, and advice alone, and as UNION TERRITORY OF LADAKH v. JAMMU AND KASHMIR 85 NATIONAL CONFERENCE [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] such, the learned ASG was correct in contending that the same would not create/confer any right in favour of R1. In Mahadeo v Sovan Devi, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1118 (where one of us, Vikram Nath, J. was part of the coram), the Court, after considering various case-laws, held that “It is well settled that inter-departmental communications are in the process of consideration for appropriate decision and cannot be relied upon as a basis to claim any right.
