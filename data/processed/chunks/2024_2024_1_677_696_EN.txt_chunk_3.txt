7. The Special Court vide the dated 26.11.2022 held that the Special Court had the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and the bar under Section 17A of the PC Act was not applicable to the facts of the case. By a separate dated 26.11.2022, the Special Court took the cognizance of the alleged offences against all the 75 accused and issued production warrants against the present respondent nos. 1 and 2 (A-1 and A-2) as also against accused no. 7. The Special Court also issued warrants/summons against the other accused. 8. Thereafter, the Special Court vide the dated 03.12.2022 holding that the investigation was incomplete and the chargesheet filed was in piecemeal, further held that the respondent nos. 1 and 2 (A-1 and A-2) were entitled to the statutory bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. 9. The appellant-CBI, being aggrieved by the said dated 03.12.2022 passed by the Special Court filed a petition being Crl.M.C. No. 6544 of 2022 before the High Court under Section 482 r/w Section 439(2) of Cr.P.C. The High Court vide the impugned dated 30.05.2023 dismissed the said petition and upheld the dated 03.12.2022 passed by the Special Court. 682 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports SUBMISSIONS: 10. The learned ASG, Mr. S.V. Raju for the appellant vehemently submitted that the chargesheet was filed by the appellant-CBI on the completion of the investigation qua 75 accused including the present respondents stating that further investigation qua some other accused was pending, which did not mean that an incomplete chargesheet was filed against the respondents. Learned ASG submitted that report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. filed by the CBI was complete containing all the details as required by law. In the instant case, the statutory bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. has been granted by the courts below after the Special Court took the cognizance of the alleged offences against the respondents, which is against the statutory scheme of the Code. According to him, it is only when a chargesheet is not filed and investigation is kept pending, the benefit of the proviso appended to sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the Code would be available to the offender, however once the chargesheet is filed, the said right of the accused ceases, and such a right does not revive merely because a further investigation remains pending within the meaning of Section 173(8) of the Code. To buttress his submissions, Mr. S.V. Raju has placed heavy reliance on the decision in case of Dinesh Dalmia vs. CBI1. He also relied upon the in M. Ravindran v. Intelligence Officer, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence2, to submit that where the accused fails to apply for default bail when his right accrues, and subsequently a chargesheet, additional complaint or a report seeking extension of time is preferred before the Magistrate, the right to default bail would be extinguished. 11. Per contra, the learned Senior Advocate Mr. Mukul Rohatgi for the respondent no. 1 submitted that the issue of cognizance had nothing to do with the default bail, in as much as the right under Section 167(2) is a statutory right, when the chargesheet is not filed within the prescribed time limit and even if filed, a complete chargesheet is not filed.
