However, the cheque was not issued to the complainant nor any intimation in this regard, was given to the school authorities. 1478 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 9.3. The case of the prosecution was that the respondent demanded illegal gratification of Rs.2,000/- for showing official favour in the matter of getting the bill sanctioned that was due to be paid to the complainant and others by influencing his higher officials. Even if the respondent has no pending work with him, and he demands and accepts any gratification, the essential ingredients for the offence under Section 7 of the Act get attracted. 9.4. After obtaining necessary sanction (Ex.P25) from the Director of Treasury, Bangalore, (P.W.11) who is the competent authority as well as disciplinary authority at the relevant point of time, the prosecution was launched against the respondent for the charges framed against him and hence, there was no infirmity or illegality in initiating the prosecution against the respondent. 9.5. P.W.1 to P.W.3 along with P.W.4 and P.W.5 coupled with Investigating Officers (P.W.10 and P.W.12) consistently deposed about the drawing of seizure mahazar (Ex.P11) and their evidence also supported the case of the prosecution in entirety qua demand and acceptance of bribe amount and recovery of the same from the respondent. Therefore, the presumption under Section 20 (1) of the Act must be raised in favour of the prosecution. 9.6. Placing reliance on the decision of this Court in Krishna Ram v. State of Rajasthan,5 it is submitted that once it is proved that money was recovered from the possession of the respondent, the burden of rebutting the presumption contemplated under section 20(1) of the Act shifts upon the respondent, but he failed to do the same in the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. 9.7. Though the respondent has taken a plea that there were loan transactions between himself and the complainant (PW1) and 8 to 10 days prior to the date of trap, P.W.1 had borrowed a sum of Rs.2,000/- from the respondent and when the respondent pressurised PW1 to return back the said amount, the present case was falsely registered against him, no reliable and convincing evidence was adduced in support of the same. 5 [2009] 4 SCR 457 : 2009 (2) Crimes 337 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1479 The State of Karnataka v. Chandrasha 9.8. Thus, the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent being Government servant while working as First Division Assistant in the office of the Sub-Treasury Office at Afzalpur, demanded Rs.2,000/- from PW1 as illegal gratification for the bill to be passed by influencing his higher officials and on 05.08.2009, the respondent, while accepting the bribe of Rs.2,000/- was trapped by the Lokayukta police and thereby committed the offences punishable under Section 7 and 13(1)(d) r/w Section 13(2) of the Act. 9.9. Considering all these aspects, the trial Court rightly convicted the respondent for the offences as stated above and punished him for the same. However, the High Court erred in passing the of acquittal against the respondent, which has to be set aside in this appeal.
