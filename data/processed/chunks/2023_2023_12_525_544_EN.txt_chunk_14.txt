Since Ext.A5 legally establishes the contents of the original sale deed No.1209/1928 of SRO, Andipatti the same should confer the right over the entire property covered by Exts.A1 and A5 to the appellant/ plaintiff . In fact, this alone was declared by the trial Court and the of injunction was nothing but a natural sequel to such declaration. The First Appellate Court confi rmed the and decree granted by the trial Court. On a careful and anxious consideration of the impugned we fi nd no ground to sustain the reversal of the concurrent s of the courts below by the High Court in exercise of the power under Section 100 CPC, as no ground justifying such exercise exists in the instant case. The upshot of the discussion is that the High Cout in exercise of the power under Section 100 CPC, ought not have interfered with the fi ndings of the trial Court and decree of the trial Court which were confi rmed by the First Appellate Court. Accordingly, the impugned of the High Court invites interference. 34. In the result the appeal stands allowed. The of the High Court in S.A.(M.D.) No. 802 of 2004 dated 17.10.2012 is accordingly set aside and the of the Sub-Court, Periyankulam in A.S.No.65/97 confi rming the and decree dated 30.09.1997 in OS No.104/1996 of the District Munsif-cum-Judicial Magistrate Court, Andipatti is restored. 35. The Appeal is allowed as above. In the circumstances of the case, there will be no as to cost. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Nidhi Jain
