In such eventuality, in accordance with the factual position obtained in any particular case viz., the period of delay and the period covered by suspension of right under Section 22 (1), SICA etc., the question of condonation of delay has to be considered lest it will result in injustice as the party was statutorily E prevented from initiating action against the industrial company concerned. [Paras 24, 25][209-H; 210-A-F] 3. The existence of a ‘pre-existing dispute’ should entail dismissal of an application filed under Section 9 IBC at the threshold. Therefore, the question is whether the respondent F had raised a dispute describable as a ‘pre- existing dispute’ so as to entail dismissal of application of the appellant under Section 9, IBC. In the contextual situation it is only apposite to be remindful of the observation in Mobilox Innovations (P) Ltd. that in doing the act of separating the grain from chaff the Court need not to G be satisfied that the defence is likely to succeed. It is enough that a dispute exists between the parties and in other words, what is to be seen is whether there was a plausible contention requiring investigation for the purpose of adjudication. Taking note of the nature of the dispute of the respondent as referred H SABARMATI GAS LIMITED v. SHAH ALLOYS LIMITED 191 hereinbefore in respect of the claim made by the appellant, there A is no reason to disagree with the concurrent findings of the Tribunals that there existed a ‘pre-existing dispute’ between the parties before the receipt of demand notice under Section 8, IBC. In other words, the dismissal of the application under Section 9, IBC on the ground of ‘pre-existing dispute’ cannot be held to be B patently illegal or perverse.
