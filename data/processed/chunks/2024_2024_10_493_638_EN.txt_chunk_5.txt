[Para 200] Model Prison Manual 2016 – Manual of 2016 – Certain ambiguities – Elucidation: [2024] 10 S.C.R. 503 Sukanya Shantha v. Union of India & Ors. Held: Manual 2016 suffers from several lacunae specifically as regards its classification of “habitual offenders” and caste based discrimination – Manual mandates the classification of undertrial prisoners in three categories, wherein habitual offenders are tagged along with “Gangsters, hired Assassins, dacoits, serial killers/rapists/violent robbers, drug offenders, communal fanatics and those highly prone to escapes/ previous escapees/attack on police and other dangerous offenders/including those prone to self-harm/posing threat to public ” – Habitual offenders are tagged in the same category in relation to classification of high risk offenders and for determination of the level of security for effective surveillance – Similarly, regarding the women prisoners, it has been provided that “Habitual offenders shall be separated from casual prisoners” and that “Habitual offenders, prostitutes and brothel keepers must also be confined separately” – Phrase “habitual offender” in several prison manuals refers to people from denotified or wandering tribes – Therefore, this definition cannot be left to be interpreted and applied “in accordance with the provisions of applicable law or rules” – Secondly, Manual does not explicitly prohibit physical caste-based segregation of prisoners, except in prisons for women – Third, the Manual does not prohibit division of work on the basis of caste, except in cooking – Manual 2016 should have taken into account such practices and provided specifically for their prohibition – Fourth, Manual does not refer to the provisions of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, which prohibit manual scavenging – Said Act has a binding effect even on prisons – Fifth, caste-based privileges provided to certain prisoners are not forbidden – No special treatment shall be given to any group of persons or individuals on the basis of caste in any scenario.
