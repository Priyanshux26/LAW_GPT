Section 2(e) defi nes a scheduled bank in the Second Schedule of RBI Act. The appellant is bound by the mandate of Section 42 in terms of cash reserves to be kept with the bank. 10.10. That on a reading of Section 42(1)(d) it becomes clear that a scheduled bank is distinct from a state co-operative bank as well as a co- operative bank inasmuch as the aggregate of the liabilities of a scheduled bank which is not a state co-operative bank shall be reduced by the aggregate of the liabilities of such co-operative bank and other bank or institutions to a scheduled bank. Thus, a bank can be a scheduled bank which is not a state KSCARDB v. THE ASSESSING OFFICER, TRIVANDRUM 331 AND ORS. [B.V. NAGARATHNA, J.] co-operative bank or a co-operative bank within the meaning of sub-section (4) of the Section 80P of the Act. The appellant herein is a scheduled bank which is not a state co-operative bank or a co-operative bank within the meaning of the BR Act, 1949. 10.11. Reliance was placed on Apex Co-operative Bank of Urban Bank of Maharashtra and Goa Ltd. vs. Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank Ltd., (2003) 11 SCC 66 (“Apex Co-operative Bank of Urban Bank of Maharashtra and Goa Ltd.”) with particular reference to paragraphs 11 to 13 and 18 and the case of A.P. Varghese vs. The Kerala State Co-operative Bank Ltd. reported in AIR 2008 Ker 91 (“A.P. Varghese”) wherein the defi nition of co-operative bank as per section 56(cci) of the BR Act, 1949 was considered with particular reference to paragraphs 7 and 8, to contend that the Kerala State Co-operative Bank is a state co-operative bank as defi ned under the provisions of the NABARD Act, 1981 and the district co- operative banks are central co-operative banks as defi ned in that Act. Hence, they are co-operative banks falling within the notifi cation dated 28.01.2003 issued under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (for short, “SARFAESI Act, 2002”). It was contended that the Kerala State Co-operative Bank is a state co-operative bank which is an apex bank. That a state co-operative bank, central co-operative bank in the co-operative sector is engaged in the business of banking but the appellant herein is not engaged in the business of banking within the meaning of BR Act, 1949 and is thus entitled to the benefi t of deduction even as per sub-section (4) of Section 80P of the Act as it is not a co-operative bank. 10.12. In this regard, our attention was drawn to the provisions of State Act, 1969, namely, Section 2(rb) which defi nes a “state co-operative bank”; Section 2(ia) which defi nes a “district co-operative bank”; Section 2(ra) which defi nes a state co-operative agricultural and rural development bank and Section 2(oc) which defi nes a primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank. 10.13. It was further submitted that the appellant herein is Kerala State Co-operative Agricultural and Rural Development Bank which is as defi ned in Section 2(ra) of the State Act, 1969 and which is an apex bank having only primary co-operative agricultural and rural development banks 332 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R.
