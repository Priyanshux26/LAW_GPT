2001 Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd. v. Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association and Others entrepreneurs – As the High Court rightly observed, the selection of NTBCL appears to have been strategically aligned, given that the Concession Agreement entrusted the Steering Committee with selecting a private company promoted by IL&FS to implement the DND Flyway project – Further, this private company—NTBCL— was incorporated only after the MoU had been executed and thus could not be considered as having extensive experience in developing such large-scale infrastructural projects – The contention that there were no suitable companies capable of undertaking such infrastructural development during that period lacks any substantiation or material on record to support such sweeping claims – The selection of NTBCL without following proper procedure and without giving any opportunity to bid, to other competitors, was nothing but an opaque device resorted to, in contravention of Art.14 of the Constitution of India. [Paras 36, 38, 39, 40] Delegated Legislation – Scope of – Toll charged to users of DND Flyway – Concession Agreement, executed between NTBCL, NOIDA and IL&FS sub-delegated the power to levy and collect user fees to NTBCL – Delegation of power to levy user fees and its validity – NOIDA exceeded its authority by delegating the power to levy fees or impose tolls to NTBCL, rendering such delegation invalid – NOIDA (Levy of Infrastructure Fee) Regulations, 1998 – Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development Act, 1976 – s.6A r/w s.19: Held:1. A plain reading of Section 6A of Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development Act, 1976 makes it unequivocally clear that the ‘Authority’ is empowered to delegate the power to collect taxes or fees levied by it – However, under no circumstances does Section 6A authorize the delegation of the power to levy taxes or fees – Similarly, s.19(2)(e) of the 1976 Act enables NOIDA to frame Regulations governing the levy of taxes or fees – This provision, however, cannot be interpreted as empowering NOIDA to delegate the power of levying taxes or fees through an agreement under s.6A of the Act. [Para 46] 2. An authority vested with the power to frame subordinate legislation must act within the bounds of that power and refrain from exceeding its limits – The power to delegate must be expressly discernible in the Principal Act itself and in the absence of such provisions, no circular method can be countenanced to extract such power. [Para 47] 3. In complete contradiction and violation of the scheme of the Statute, NOIDA in purported exercise of its power to formulate 2002 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Regulations not only delegated the power to collect fee but also authorised NTBCL to revise and levy such charges – Such a delegation was totally in violation of the provisions of the 1976 Act – The responsibility to determine the amount and rate of fees lies with NOIDA; by delegating this function to NTBCL via the Concession Agreement and reinforcing it through the Regulations, NOIDA exceeded its authority moored under the 1976 Act – The Concession Agreement, in so far as it sub-delegates the power to levy and collect fees to NTBCL, is unlawful, and the Regulations justifying such sub-delegation undermine the objective of s.6A of the 1976 Principal Act – Moreover, these Regulations were introduced by NOIDA in the aftermath of enacting the Concession Agreement, serving merely as an afterthought, while having no authority to do so – Thus, NOIDA did not have any competence to delegate the power to levy fees and toll to NTBCL, and thereby overstepped its statutory bounds.
