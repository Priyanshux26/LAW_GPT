12. In Sriharan (supra), the court went on to discuss specifi cally, the role of the report submitted by the presiding offi cer, and held that the “ultimate of suspension or remission should be guided by the opinion to be rendered by the Presiding Offi cer of the court concerned.”13 This in turn, was relied upon, and explained recently, in Ram Chander v. State of Chhattisgarh14 as follows: “20. In Sriharan [Union of India v. V. Sriharan, (2016) 7 SCC 1 : (2016) 2 SCC (Cri) 695] , the Court observed that the opinion of the Presiding Judge shines a light on the nature of the crime that has been committed, the record of the convict, their background and other relevant factors. Crucially, the Court observed that the opinion of the Presiding Judge would enable the Government to take the “right” decision as to whether or not the sentence should be remitted. Hence, it cannot be said that the opinion of the Presiding Judge is only a 12 (2000) 2 SCC 595[para 6] [hereafter referred to as ‘Laxman Naskar’]. These factors were reiterated in Laxman Naskar v. State of W.B. (2000) 7 SCC 626 [para 6] as well. 13 Para 143. 14 [2022] 4 SCR 1103[hereafter referred to as ‘Ram Chander’] 496 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. relevant factor, which does not have any determinative eff ect on the application for remission. The purpose of the procedural safeguard under Section 432(2)CrPC would stand defeated if the opinion of the Presiding Judge becomes just another factor that may be taken into consideration by the Government while deciding the application for remission. It is possible then that the procedure under Section 432(2) would become a mere formality. 21. However, this is not to say that the appropriate Government should mechanically follow the opinion of the Presiding Judge. If the opinion of the Presiding Judge does not comply with the requirements of Section 432(2) or if the Judge does not consider the relevant factors for grant of remission that have been laid down in Laxman Naskar v. Union of India [Laxman Naskar v. Union of India, (2000) 2 SCC 595 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 509], the Government may request the Presiding Judge to consider the matter afresh. 22. In the present case, there is nothing to indicate that the Presiding Judge took into account the factors which have been laid down in Laxman Naskar v. Union of India [Laxman Naskar v. Union of India, (2000) 2 SCC 595 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 509] . These factors include assessing: (i) whether the off ence aff ects the society at large; (ii) the probability of the crime being repeated; (iii) the potential of the convict to commit crimes in future; (iv) if any fruitful purpose is being served by keeping the convict in prison; and (v) the socio-economic condition of the convict’s family. In Laxman Naskar v. State of W.B. [Laxman Naskar v. State of W.B., (2000)7 SCC 626: 2000 SCC (Cri) 1431] and State of Haryana v. Jagdish [State of Haryana v. Jagdish, (2010) 4 SCC 216 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 806], this Court has reiterated that these factors will be considered while deciding the application of a convict for premature release.
