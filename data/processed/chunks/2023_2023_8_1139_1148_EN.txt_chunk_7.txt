Though Section 69(1) which confers powers upon the Commissioner to the arrest of a person does not contain the safeguards that are incorporated in Section 41 and 41A B of Cr.P.C., we think Section 70(1) of the CGST Act takes care of the contingency. 42. In any case, the moment the Commissioner has reasons to believe that a person has committed a cognizable and non- bailable offence warranting his arrest, then we think that the C safeguards before arresting a person, as provided in Sections 41 and 41A of Cr.P.C., may have to be kept in mind. 43. But, it may be remembered that Section 41A(3) of Cr.P.C., does not provide an absolute irrevocable guarantee against arrest. Despite the compliance with the notices of appearance, D a Police Officer himself is entitled under Section 41A(3) Cr.P.C., for reasons to be recorded, arrest a person. At this stage, we may notice the difference in language between Section 41A(3) of Cr.P.C. and 69(1) of CGST Act, 2017. Under Section 41A(3) of Cr.P.C., “reasons are to be recorded”, once E the Police Officer is of the opinion that the persons concerned ought to be arrested. In contrast, Section 69(1) uses the phrase “reasons to believe”. There is a vast difference between “reasons to be recorded” and “reasons to believe.” 19. We are still inclined to give one more opportunity to both the respondents to appear before the authorities for the purpose of recording F of their statements. If the respondents fail to appear, then it shall be open for the authority concerned to proceed further in accordance with law. 20. In view of the aforesaid, both the appeals stand allowed. The common dated 24.12.2018 passed by the High Court is set aside. G 21. Pending application(s), if any, stand(s) disposed of. Divya Pandey Appeals allowed. (Assisted by : Shevali Monga, LCRA) H
