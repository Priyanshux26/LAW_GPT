In the meantime, the complainant was appointed as a teacher. The suit pending before the District Court, Tuticorin was disposed in favour of A. Sairam. 8. Having given the fraudulent allurements to the complainant, the accused got registered a sale deed in their name as Document No. 1839 of 2008 dated 27th February, 2008 on the file of Sub Registrar Office, Kovilpatti in respect of some plots of land situated in the Allampatti village of total area 7.618 acres. The complainant invested a sum of Rs. 1,01,47,800/- towards this transaction whereas, the accused invested proportionately much lesser amounts in the said land deal. A-1, A-3, A-4, and A-6 along with the complainant, purchased the said parcel of land from A. Sairam for a total consideration of Rs. 3,08,33,600/-. However, as per the complainant, the accused never gave him the plots equivalent to the investment made by him and thereby, committed fraud and breach of trust. 9. The complainant further alleged that A-2 and A-5 had conspired with A-1, A-3, A-4, and A-6 to cheat him. The accused made the complainant believe that the business of real estate is generally 818 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports carried on by word of mouth and trust. However, at a later point of time, the accused started indulging in criminal breach of trust with the ulterior motive of cheating the complainant. 10. A-1, A-3, A-4 and A-6 invested the amount provided by the complainant towards his share in the land deal and completed the sale of the suit property on 27th February, 2008 with A. Sairam. However, despite the assurances, the accused conspired and refused to give the due share of plots to the complainant thereby committing breach of trust. Therefore, a Panchayat meeting was convened on 19th July, 2010 and a settlement deed was also executed wherein, it was agreed that 52 plots admeasuring 256.51 cents would be handed over by A-1 and A-2 to the complainant towards the investment made by him. 11. Under the same settlement, A-4 and A-6 were given 45 plots to the extent of 233.50 cents for the investment made by them after deducting land to the extent of 16.50 cents towards the passages. On the very date of execution of the settlement deed, all the accused entered into an agreement with Dharamraj(hereinafter being referred to as ‘A-7’), brother-in-law of A-4 and executed a General Power of Attorney(GPA) in his favour after receiving a sum of Rs. 30,00,000/- towards plots Nos. 68, 69, 70 and 71 which were a part and parcel of the settlement deed. 12. The complainant alleged that the accused failed to pay a sum of Rs. 19,00,000/- which would be the share amount due to the complainant out of the sale price of Rs. 30,00,000/-. Thus, the accused persons despite being signatories to the settlement deed did not act as promised under the settlement and thereby, committed breach of trust. 13. The accused had also promised to execute the sale deeds of some plots in favour of the persons to be nominated by the complainant.
