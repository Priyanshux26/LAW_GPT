The Explanation to Section 6(3) is the same as Explanation I to Section 6 as originally enacted. …” (Emphasis supplied) C 71. The following propositions, amongst others, follow from the abovequoted paragraphs of the decision in Vineeta Sharma (supra): (A) Sub-section (1) of the substituted Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 recognises a joint Hindu family governed by Mitakshara law. D (B) The coparcenary must exist on 9.9.2005, i.e., the date of commencement of the Amendment Act, 2005. (C) The daughter has been recognised and treated as a coparcener by birth, with equal rights and liabilities as of that of a son. (D) It is not necessary that a coparcener whose daughter is E conferred with the rights is alive or not on the date of commencement of the Amendment Act, 2005. The daughter would step into the coparcenary as that of a son by birth. (E) Though the daughter would step into the coparcenary as that of a son by birth whether the daughter is born before the F commencement of the Amendment Act, 2005 or after the commencement of the Amendment Act, 2005, but the daughter born before the commencement of the Amendment Act, 2005 can claim coparcenary rights only with effect from the date of the amendment, i.e., 9.9.2005 with saving of past transactions as G provided in the proviso to Section 6(1) read with Section 6(5). (F) In case a coparcener living on the date of commencement of the Amendment Act, 2005 (i.e., 9.9.2005) dies after 9.9.2005, inheritance is not by survivorship but by intestate or testamentary succession as provided in substituted Section 6(3). H 60 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 72. As noted earlier, sub-section (5) of substituted Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 provides that nothing contained in the substituted Section 6 shall apply to a partition, which has been effected before 20th December, 2004 (i.e., date on which the Bill corresponding to the Amendment Act, 2005 was presented in the Rajya Sabha). Explanation to the substituted Section 6 provides that for the purposes of B Section 6 “partition” means (i) any partition made by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908), or (ii) any partition effected by a decree of a court. Interpreting sub-section (5) of substituted Section 6 and Explanation to substituted Section 6, the Court in Vineeta Sharma (supra), has observed in para C 67 as under: “67. The proviso to Section 6(1) and Section 6(5) saves any partition effected before 20-12-2004. However, Explanation to Section 6(5) recognises partition effected by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, D 1908 or by a decree of a court. Other forms of partition have not been recognised under the definition of “partition” in the Explanation.” 73. In regard to the sub-section (5) of substituted Section 6 and Explanation to substituted Section 6, the Court held: E (A) It has been held that the daughter has now become entitled to claim partition of coparcenary with effect from 9.09.2005 like a son.
