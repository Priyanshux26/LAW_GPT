Following the meeting held between the parties on 19th April, 2018 the respondents made a written offer to settle the matter on 26 May 2018. Thus, the Tribunal finds that the period of limitation had not commenced until 26 [2024] 9 S.C.R. 519 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. May 2018 and consequently had not expired when the request for arbitration was received by the ICC Secretariat on 2 May 2019.” The afore-quoted observations are in teeth of decisions of this Court in (i) Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited v. Nortel Networks Pvt. Ltd.5 and (ii) B & T AG v. Ministry of Defence6 where it has been held that mere negotiations will not postpone the cause of action for the purpose of limitation. (ii) The period of limitation for the claim would have to be counted as three years from the date of completion i.e., 21 September 2015, which got over before 2 May 2019 i.e., the date when request was received for arbitration. Once the claim is barred by limitation, the award allowing the claim would be deemed to be violative of fundamental policy of Indian law and, therefore, vulnerable in the light of the law declared in (i) Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI7 and (ii) Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority.8 (iii) The Arbitral Tribunal applied different yardstick for computing limitation of the claim than what was adopted for the counterclaim. For example, the start point of limitation for the claim was taken as 26 May 2018 whereas for the counterclaim it was taken as 21 September 2015. This amounted to unequal treatment of the parties more so when claim as well as counterclaim arose from the same contractual relationship. (iv) Once the declaratory relief qua Debit Notes dated 24 August 2015 (i.e. in respect of Rs. 3,30,00,000 towards liquidated damages for the delay in supply and erection under the purchase s) and 12 January 2016 (i.e. in respect of Rs. 5,94,06,693/- towards Customs Duties) was held barred by limitation, the amount reflected in the Debit Notes ought to have been deemed payable by the claimant and that amount ought to have been adjusted against any amount payable to the claimant. 5 [2021] 2 SCR 644 : (2021) 5 SCC 738, paragraphs 20 and 21 6 [2023] 7 SCR 599 : (2024) 5 SCC 358, paragraph 73 7 [2019] 7 SCR 522 : (2019) 15 SCC 131 8 [2014] 13 SCR 895 : (2015) 3 SCC 49 520 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (v) The Division Bench erroneously relied on the minutes dated 19 April 2018 to apply Section 18 of the 1963 Act for extending the period of limitation of the claim when it was nobody’s case that limitation stood extended thereby. Further, if the minutes dated 19 April 2018 were to be relied, it ought to have been relied in toto and not in part. That is, it should have been taken as an admission of liability of the claimant towards liquidated damages for the delay as well as customs duty.
