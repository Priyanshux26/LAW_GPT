We must, however, notice that in paragraph-18 of Garware (supra), the Court referred to paragraph-12 of SBP (supra), which we have already noticed and, thereafter, the Court went on to hold, inter alia, as follows: E “19. It will be seen that neither in the Statement of Objects and Reasons nor in the Law Commission Report is there any mention of SMS Tea Estates [SMS Tea Estates (P) Ltd. v. Chandmari Tea Co. (P) Ltd., (2011) 14 SCC 66 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 777] . This is for the very good reason that the Supreme Court or the F High Court, while deciding a Section 11 application, does not, in any manner, decide any preliminary question that arises between the parties. The Supreme Court or the High Court is only giving effect to the provisions of a mandatory enactment which, no doubt, is to protect revenue. SMS Tea Estates [SMS Tea Estates (P) Ltd. v. Chandmari Tea Co. (P) Ltd., (2011) 14 SCC 66 : (2012) G 4 SCC (Civ) 777] has taken account of the mandatory provisions contained in the Stamp Act and held them applicable to judicial authorities, which would include the Supreme Court and the High Court acting under Section 11. A close look at Section 11(6-A) would show that when the Supreme Court or the High Court H M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 359 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] considers an application under Sections 11(4) to 11(6), and comes A across an arbitration clause in an agreement or conveyance which is unstamped, it is enjoined by the provisions of the Stamp Act to first impound the agreement or conveyance and see that stamp duty and penalty (if any) is paid before the agreement, as a whole, can be acted upon. It is important to remember that the Stamp B Act applies to the agreement or conveyance as a whole. Therefore, it is not possible to bifurcate the arbitration clause contained in such agreement or conveyance so as to give it an independent existence, as has been contended for by the respondent. The independent existence that could be given for certain limited purposes, on a harmonious reading of the Registration Act, 1908 C and the 1996 Act has been referred to by Raveendran, J. in SMS Tea Estates [SMS Tea Estates (P) Ltd. v. Chandmari Tea Co. (P) Ltd., (2011) 14 SCC 66 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 777] when it comes to an unregistered agreement or conveyance. However, the Stamp Act, containing no such provision as is contained in D Section 49 of the Registration Act, 1908, has been held by the said to apply to the agreement or conveyance as a whole, which would include the arbitration clause contained therein. It is clear, therefore, that the introduction of Section 11(6-A) does not, in any manner, deal with or get over the basis of the in SMS Tea Estates [SMS Tea Estates (P) Ltd. v. Chandmari E Tea Co. (P) Ltd., (2011) 14 SCC 66 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 777] , which continues to apply even after the amendment of Section 11(6-A).” (Emphasis supplied) F 87.
