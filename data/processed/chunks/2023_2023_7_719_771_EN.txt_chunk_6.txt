[Para 70][763-E-F] Circumstances — Disclosure statements, consequential discoveries and their connect with crime. H SANTOSH @ BHURE v. STATE (G.N.C.T.) OF DELHI 727 8. As regards recovery of clothes at the instance of ‘S’, A PW4, a witness to that recovery, has been declared hostile. There is thus no support to that recovery from any public witness. And since this Court has already doubted the disclosure statements set up by the police witnesses, it would be unsafe to place reliance on their testimonies in respect of the recoveries pursuant thereto, B particularly, when the place from where recovery of clothes is shown is none other than the rooftop of the building from where 13 days ago the body of the deceased was found. Because, in such a scenario, it would be logical to expect that the police would have left no nook and corner of that building unscanned. For all the reasons above, we doubt the recovery of clothes at the instance C of ‘S’ and thereby discard the circumstance of recovery of clothes at his instance. The circumstance that the clothes carried blood of same group as of the deceased is rendered meaningless because there is no admissible evidence to connect the clothes with the two accused. As regards recovery of knife at the instance D of ‘N’, the same has been denied by ‘N’ and there appears no independent witness to support it, inasmuch as PW-13, touted as a public witness, turned out to be a special police officer. Otherwise also, its incriminating value is extremely limited because, firstly, there is no forensic evidence connecting the knife with the crime; secondly, the knife is a common knife which could E easily be available; thirdly, the wounds found on the body of the deceased were of different dimensions giving rise to possibility of use of more weapon than one; and, fourthly, the entire exercise of recovery does not inspire our confidence, particularly, because the first attempt to recover had failed. For all the reasons above, F we hold that the circumstances with regard to making of disclosure statements and consequential discoveries/recoveries were not proved beyond reasonable doubt. [Paras 75, 76, 81, 82][766-B-E; 768-H; 769-A-C] 9. In light of the discussion above, there is no hesitation in G holding that the prosecution has failed to prove a chain of incriminating circumstances as to conclusively point out that in all human probability it was the two accused or any one of them, and no one else, who had committed the murder.
