This Court has the power to strike down a law on the ground of want of authority, but the Court will not sit in appeal over the policy of the Parliament in enacting a law.

(1983) 1 SCC 147, para 20. 56 Rustom Cavasjee Cooper (Banks Nationalisation) v. Union of India (1970) 1 SCC 248, para 63. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1043 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 53. In summary, the judicial review of government policies encapsulates determining whether they infringe upon the fundamental rights of citizens, contravene constitutional provisions, violate statutory regulations, or display manifest arbitrariness, capriciousness, or mala fides.57 The focus of judicial scrutiny is limited to the legality of the policy, excluding any evaluation of its wisdom or soundness. The Court cannot compel the government to formulate a policy, evaluate alternatives or assess the effectiveness of existing policies. This constraint stems from the principle of separation of powers, where the Court lacks the democratic mandate and institutional expertise to delve into such matters. Thus, while the Court can invalidate a policy, it lacks the authority to create one. 54. However, to reiterate, while the Court cannot look into the aforementioned aspects, the Court can check the constitutional validity of a policy, particularly so when it is elevated as an act of the Legislature. 55. The present challenge concerns checking the validity of Section 6A, a statutory provision. We are, therefore, of the firm view that the Respondents’ plea regarding foreclosing the Petitioners’ challenge at the threshold, on the grounds of judicial review, cannot be accepted. ii. Delay and maintainability of the writ petitions 56. In addition to the grounds of non-justiciability, the Respondents also protested against the maintainability of the writ petitions on account of inordinate delay and laches. They argued that while the subject provision was introduced in 1985, the writ petitions challenging the same have been filed after a long period of 27 years. Applying the doctrine of laches, the Respondents argued that the writ petitions must be held to be non-maintainable since the rights created during these 27 years cannot now be taken away. In support of their contentions, the Respondents have cited, inter alia, a 5-judge bench decision of this Court in Tilokchand Motichand v. H. B. Munshi,58 and urged that even if it is assumed that Section 6A violates the fundamental 57 Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education v. Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Sheth (1984) 4 SCC 27 58 Tilokchand Motichand v. H. B. Munshi (1969) 1 SCC 110. 1044 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports rights of the Petitioners, it cannot be declared unconstitutional at this belated juncture. 57. Per contra, the Petitioners argued that inter partes, the question regarding maintainability has already been decided by this Court in Assam Sanmilita Mahasangha v. Union of India (supra).
