3. Before pursuing the aftermath of the allegations by the Respondent- Agency, it is crucial to delve into the backdrop in which the allegations arose against the Appellant-Company. 4. The Appellant-Company claims to be a private limited company duly incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, which is engaged in manufacturing and exporting of cosmetics and toilet preparations and having one of its units in KASEZ. As per the Appellant-Company, its products get cleared from the KASEZ Unit into the Domestic Tariff Area (hereinafter referred to as “DTA”) in consonance with the necessary permissions granted to it by the appropriate authority. It is its case that it had effected the following three kinds of clearances from its KASEZ Unit into the DTA, being (a) Clearances of goods weighing or containing less than 20 gram or 20 millilitre, (b) products containing alcohol, and (c) other goods in “Wholesale Packs”. 5. From August 2004 onwards, Officers of the Kandla Customs (hereinafter referred as “Revenue Authorities”) moved against the Appellant-Company, alleging that they had escaped payment of CVD on the aforementioned clearances on account of non-disclosure of MRP as per the provisions of the Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as “SWM Act 1976”) as they had declared only the invoice value of the said goods. This was a violation of the proviso to Section 3(2) of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (hereinafter referred to as “CT Act 1975”) read with Section 4A(2) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as 58 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “CE Act 1944”), and on the said ground, goods being cleared by the Appellant-Company into the DTA were intercepted. The Revenue Authorities issued Show Cause Notices dated 03.11.2004, 10.11.2004, and 10.02.2005 (along with Corrigendum dated 11.03.2005) under Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962 (hereinafter referred to as “CA 1962”), under Section 11A of the CE Act 1944, and under Section 124 of CA 1962 respectively. 6. Thereafter, pursuant to the said allegation based on source information to Respondent-Agency, First Information Report bearing number RC-6(A)/2005-GNR under Section 120B read with Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as “IPC 1860”) and Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as “PCA 1998”) was registered on 04.04.2005 at Gandhinagar branch of Respondent-Agency (hereinafter referred to as “the FIR”). A raid is also claimed to have been conducted on the KASEZ Unit of the Appellant-Company by the Respondent-Agency. 7. Eventually, Assessment s were passed observing the non- declaration of MRP on the concerned goods by the Appellant-Company. These Assessment s were assailed by the Appellant-Company before the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals), Kandla by filing of appeals, which resulted in the passing of s dated 09.05.2005 and 30.06.2005. The Commissioner of Customs (Appeals), Kandla observed that the concerned goods were ought to be assessed under Section 3(2) of the CT Act 1975 as opposed to the proviso to the said provision. Furthermore, declaration of MRP is necessary on packages intended for retail sale and not for bigger packages for wholesale trade.
