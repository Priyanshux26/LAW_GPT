[Paras 21, 25, 27, 29-31] Criminal trial – Expeditious disposal – Crimes under the statutes-PMLA, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 and Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985: Held: Considering the gravity of the offences in such statutes, expeditious disposal of trials for the crimes under these statutes is contemplated – Expeditious disposal of the trial is also warranted considering the higher threshold set for the grant of bail – Hence, the requirement of expeditious disposal of cases must be read into these statutes – Inordinate delay in the conclusion of the trial and the higher threshold for the grant of bail cannot go together – Bail is the rule, and jail is the exception – These stringent provisions regarding the grant of bail, such as s.45(1)(iii) of the PMLA, cannot become a tool which can be used to incarcerate the accused without trial for an unreasonably long time.
