All the reasons which could possibly or theoretically have had a bearing on the State Government’s decision to establish the OAT are not relevant. Only the State Government’s actual reason for establishing the OAT is relevant in considering whether it misinterpreted L. Chandra Kumar’s case (supra). The State Government’s reason for setting up the OAT was to B achieve speedy justice. A crucial factor (to its mind) was the elimination of a tier of litigation. The State Government was of the opinion that the creation of the OAT would not fulfil the purpose of a speedy redressal of grievances because there was no improvement to the justice delivery system through the elimination of a tier of litigation. C 80. As for the submission that the Orissa High Court’s pendency will increase if the cases pending before the OAT are transferred to it, the State Government is entitled to structure its justice delivery systems within the parameters defined by law. Its decision may be set aside only if it is unconstitutional or without the authority of law. D 81. In addition to the impact of the decision in L. Chandra Kumar (supra), the State Government considered other factors related to the functioning of the OAT. In the note dated 16 September 2015, the State Government furnished other reasons for its decision to abolish the OAT: E “Government is incurring a significant sum of expenditure on the OAT as is exhibited in the table given below: Table 1: Plan and Non-Plan Provision for OAT (Rs in Lakhs) Head of Expenditure 2014-15 2015-16 F Plan 205.59 200 Non-Plan 616.24 697.69 Total 821.83 897.69 G The following table represents the institution and disposal of OA and MP cases in OAT month wise from January 2014 to December 2014:- H ORISSA ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL BAR ASSOCIATION v. 787 UNION OF INDIA [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] A B C D E Table 2 shows that there were 47,619 cases pending at the beginning of 2014. During the calendar year 2014, 7417 cases were disposed whereas 13,823 fresh cases were instituted. At the end of the year 2014, the number of pending cases went up to 54,334 … As an institutional mechanism it seems the Tribunal has F not been able to provide speedy decisions …” (emphasis in original) The State Government was therefore concerned not only with the additional tier of litigation at the Orissa High Court but also with the expenditure incurred to operate the OAT as well as the rate at which the G OAT disposed of cases. It was persuaded to abolish the OAT due to a combination of all these factors. 82. From the above discussion, the following conclusions emerge: H 788 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A a. While arriving at the decision to abolish the OAT, the State Government considered relevant reasons. It considered whether the OAT was capable of fulfilling the purpose for which it was established after the decision in L. Chandra Kumar (supra). It placed in the balance the expenditure incurred to operate the OAT as well as the rate of disposal of B cases.
