42. In Kadodara Power45, referring to proportionality requirement, it is held: “How proportionality of consumption has to be assessed: 17. The Electricity Rules 2005have set down that not less than 51% of the aggregate electricity generated by a CGP, determined on an annual basis is consumed for captive use. However, in case there are more than one owner then there is a further rule of proportionality in consumption. In case the power plant is set up by a cooperative society the condition of use of 51% can be satisfi ed collectively by the members of the cooperative society. However, if it is an ‘association of persons’ then the captive users are required to hold not less than 45 Supra note 5. 374 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 26% of the ownership of the plant and such captive users are required to consume not less than 51% of electricity generated determined on an annual basis in proportion to the share of the ownership of the power plant within a variation not exceeding + 10%. For example, if a CGP produces 10,000 kWh of electricity, 5100 kWh need to be consumed by the owners of CGP. In case there are three owners holding equal share, each one must consume 1/3rd of the 5100 kWh within a variation of + 10% i.e. between 1530 kWh to 1870 kWh. It will not be proper to assess the proportionality of the consumption on 100% of the generation. The Commission, however, appears to have calculated the proportion of use to 100% of the total consumption which may be more than 51% of generation….” We agree with the said reasoning in Kadodara Power46 But we would like to elaborate on the said reasoning by referring to the clarifi cations and the illustrations provided by Mr. M.G. Ramachandran, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant – Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Limited. 43. The last portion of the second proviso to Rule 3(1)(a) of the Rules, that is, the proportionality principle, specifi es an unitary qualifying ratio. The unitary qualifying ratio is the consumption requirement divided by the shareholding requirement, that is, 51% dividedby 26%. This means that the owner of every 1% shareholding of the CGP should have minimum consumption of 1.96% of the electricity generated by the CGP, with a variation of +10% being permissible. Therefore, the unitary qualifying ratio has to be within a range of 1.764% to 2.156%. In other words, we do not take into consideration 100% of the electricity generated. Instead, we apply the shareholding requirement, which should not be less than 26% in aggregate, to the electricity consumed, which should not be less than 51%, and thereby compute whether the ownership criteria and the proportionate consumption criteria is satisfi ed. Benefi t of variation by 10% either way is to be a given. 44. For clarity, the illustrations provided Mr. M.G. Ramachandran, Senior Advocate, are reproduced below: 46 Supra note 5. M/S.
