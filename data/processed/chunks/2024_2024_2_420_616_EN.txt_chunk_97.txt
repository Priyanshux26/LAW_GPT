205. During the course of the arguments, the learned Solicitor General submitted that the limit of seven and a half percent of the average net profits in the preceding three financial years was perceived as a restriction on companies who would want to donate in excess of the statutory cap. The learned Solicitor General further submitted that companies who wanted to donate in excess of the statutory cap would create shell companies and route their contributions through them. Therefore, it was suggested that the statutory cap was removed to discourage the creation of shell companies. 206. The limit on restrictions to political parties was incorporated in Section 293A of the 1956 Act through the Companies (Amendment) Bill 1985. The original restriction on contribution was five per cent of a company’s average net profits during the three immediately preceding financial years. The Lok Sabha debates pertaining to the Companies Bill furnish an insight into why contribution restrictions 214 [2006] Suppl. 5 SCR 1: (2006) 7 SCC 1 215 [20121 S3CR ]28 3 : (2013) 10 SCC 1 216 Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner, [1927 S8CR ]27 2 : (1978) 1 SCC 405 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 553 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. were imposed in the first place. The then Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers and Industry and Company Affairs justified the contribution restrictions, stating that: “Since companies not having profits should not be encouraged to make political contributions, monetary ceiling as an alternative to a certain percentage of profits for arriving at the permissible amount of political donation has been done away with.”2'” 207. Thus, the object behind limiting contributions was to discourage loss-making companies from contributing to political parties. In 1985, Parliament prescribed the condition that only companies which have been in existence for more than three years can contribute. This condition was also included to prevent loss-making companies and shell companies from making financial contributions to political parties. If the ostensible object of the amendment, as contended by the learned Solicitor General, was to discourage the creation of shell companies, there is no justification for removing the cap on contributions which was included for the very same purpose: to deter shell companies from making political contributions. In fact, when the proposal to amend Section 182 of the 2013 Act was mooted by the Government in 2017, the Election Commission of India opposed the amendment and suggested that the Government reconsider its decision on the ground that it would open up the possibility of creating shell companies. The relevant portion of the opinion of the ECI is reproduced below: “Certain amendments have been proposed in Section 182 of the Companies Act, where the first proviso has been omitted and consequently the limit of seven and a half percent (7.5 %) of the average net profits in the preceding three financial years on contributions by companies has been removed from the statute. This opens up the possibility of shell companies being set up for the sole purpose of making donations to political parties with no other business of consequence having disbursable profits.”2'8 217 Lok Sabha Debates, Companies Bill (16 May 1985).
