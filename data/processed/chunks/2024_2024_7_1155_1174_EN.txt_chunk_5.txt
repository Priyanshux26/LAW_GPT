1 to 3 respectively, for commission of offences under Sections 302, 343, 217, 218, 330, 120B and 34, IPC. It is seeking discharge under Section 227, Cr.PC, in the aforesaid case viz., Crime No.371/1993 that appellant herein approached the court of Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge, Ghaziabad by filing application dated 04.04.2007 contending absolute absence any ground to proceed against him. The said application for discharge under Section 227, Cr.PC, was rejected by the court of Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge (CBI), as per dated 19.04.2007. The impugned dated 21.04.2023 was passed by the High Court in the petition filed under Section 482, Cr.PC, against the said dated 19.04.2007. Rival contentions: 9. The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant would contend that the very charge filed by the CBCID dated 21.02.2000 in the custodial death case viz., FIR No. 371/2023 would reveal that the appellant herein is the informant. It is also submitted that the final report filed in the ‘custodial death case’, dated 21.02.2000 would further show that he was witness No.1 and also as accused No.3. The Learned Senior Counsel would further submit that there is absolute absence of any material to arraign the appellant herein as an accused with the aid of either Section 120B, IPC or Section 34, IPC. The next submission was that even if the statements of the witnesses recorded under Section 161, Cr.PC, including the witnesses related to the deceased Ram Kishore like Smt. Santosh, Shri Promod Kumar and Shri Bhim Singh, who are respectively the widow, son and brother of deceased Ram Kishore are taken as correct, they would not reveal anything to base an allegation of criminal conspiracy or sharing of common intention against the appellant. It is the further submission that virtually, the appellant’s application for discharge was dismissed by the Court of the [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1163 Ram Prakash Chadha v. The State of Uttar Pradesh Additional Sessions Judge taking two circumstances as suspicious circumstances (i) that it was he who had taken accused Ram Kishore to Police Station in connection with the investigation in Crime No.351/1993 (the robbery case) (ii) that immediately on the death of Ram Kishore from the hospital he filed the complaint which culminated in the registration of FIR No.371/1993 in connection with the murder of Ram Kishore, alleging that Inspector, Modi Nagar and 3-4 other police personnel had taken Ram Kishore with them for interrogation and apprehending the cause of his death due to torture by police personnel. It is submitted neither the statements of witnesses or the chargesheet carry any such accusation or insinuation and that suspicion was made only by the court in the dated 19.04.2007 while rejecting the appellant’s application for discharge. In short, the contention is that neither the trial court nor the High Court considered the application for discharge in the manner required under law. 10. Per Contra, the learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the State would submit the materials on record produced along with the chargesheet would prima facie show that it was the appellant who lodged the complaint resulting in registration of Crime No.351/1993, and that it was in connection with the investigation of the said crime that the appellant himself produced the deceased Ram Kishore before the Police Station after calling him from his house through another employee and as such his very action in filing another complaint leading to the registration of Crime No.371/1993 against the first accused, the then SHO, Police Station, Modi Nagar, for the death of Ram Kishore immediately on coming to know about the death of Ram Kishore, is sufficient to create a strong suspicion against the appellant.
