v. MULTIPLEX ASSN. OF 129 GUJARAT THROUGH ITS PRESIDENT [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] the requirements relate to the “substance” or “essence” of A the statute, if so, strict adherence to those requirements is a precondition to give effect to that doctrine. On the other hand, if the requirements are procedural or directory in that they are not of the “essence” of the thing to be done but are given with a view to the ly conduct of business, they may be B fulfilled by substantial, if not strict compliance. In other words, a mere attempted compliance may not be sufficient, but actual compliance with those factors which are considered as essential.” 22. A reasonable method of calculating benefit of tax exemption, for the purpose of considering (whether the 100% limit equivalent to C capital expenditure) was reached or not is to notionally determine the tax amounts payable during the relevant period, when the multiplexes enjoyed tax exemption. This is possible, having regard to the returns filed by them during the time when they sought and were granted exemption. The outer limit (100% investment) is a discernible amount, D which the units would be able to furnish, with appropriate proof in their books of accounts, and valuations furnished by them. Clearly enunciating this principle and applying to the facts of this case, High Court has followed a reasonable method which cannot, in this court’s opinion, be faulted. 23. For the above reasons, this court holds that there is no merit in E this appeal. It is accordingly dismissed. No costs. Divya Pandey Appeal dismissed. F G H
