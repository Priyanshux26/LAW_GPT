[Paras 6.4, 6.5][319-E, H; 320-A-D] G Madras Bar Association v. Union of India and Another (2021) 7 SCC 369 : [2020] 2 SCR 246; State of Uttar Pradesh and Others v. All Uttar Pradesh Consumer Protection Bar Association (2017) 1 SCC 444 : [2016] 8 SCR 851 – relied on. H 292 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 1.2 Mechanism of having written examination was confirmed by this Court which has been removed under the new Rules, 2020. Earlier under Consumer Protection Act, 1986, there were Rules, 2017 in so far as some of the States are concerned and Rules, 2019 so far as the State of Maharashtra is concerned, which provided for a written examination and viva voce, which was under B the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 has been repealed and the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has come into force w.e.f. 24.07.2020 with a sole intention to provide adequate safeguards to the consumers and the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Fora and State Commissions C are enhanced substantially. However, there is no substantial change in the scheme with respect to the adjudication of the consumer disputes. No justification at all is shown to do away with the written examination while framing the Rules, 2020 under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. Therefore, as rightly observed by the High Court, the Rule 6(9) of the Rules, 2020 is D unconstitutional, arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, more particularly, when the same is wholly impermissible to override/overrule the earlier decisions of this Court and that too without any justification. This Court is in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court. [Paras E 6.6-6.8][320-E-H; 321-A] 1.3 Under provision 4(1) of Rules, 2020, a person who is eligible to be appointed as a district judge (having minimum experience of 7 years) is qualified to be appointed as President of the District Commission but in to be appointed as a F Member, Rule 4(2)(c) mandates a minimum experience of 15 years which is rightly held to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Similarly providing 20 years’ experience under Rule 3(2)(b) also rightly held to be arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Even under Rule 3(1) a judge of the High Court, present or former, shall be qualified for appointment of G the President. As per Article 233 of the Constitution, a lawyer needs to have only 7 years of practice as an advocate in High Court. Under the circumstances to provide 20 years’ experience under Rule 3(2)(b) is rightly held to be unconstitutional, arbitrary and violative of the Article 14 of the Constitution of India. This H Court is in complete agreement with the view taken by the High THE SECRETARY MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS v. DR. 293 MAHINDRA BHASKAR LIMAYE Court. In the case of Madras Bar Association– MBA III, this Court A directed to consider 10 years’ experience, after detail reasoning. [Paras 7.1, 7.2][321-C-F] Madras Bar Association v.
