This intent is what makes these crimes particularly heinous. The abuser is not only violating the child’s body but is also reducing them to an object for their own gratification, with little regard for the child’s dignity or well-being. This dehumanization is evident in the production and distribution of CSEAM, where the child is treated not as a person but as a commodity to be consumed. Those who consume such material may develop an increased desire to engage in further acts of child exploitation. The viewing of CSEAM can desensitize individuals to the horrors of child abuse, leading them to seek out more extreme forms of exploitation or even to commit acts of abuse themselves.10 231. Moreover, the demand for such material will always incubate a corresponding production and distribution of CSEAM.11 Abusers may be motivated to create and distribute these materials to satisfy the demand, leading to the abuse of more children.12 This cycle of abuse and exploitation underscores the need for stringent measures to not only punish those who create and distribute CSEAM but also to deter potential consumers and reduce the demand for such material. 232. Child sexual exploitative material is deeply degrading to the dignity of children. It reduces them to objects of sexual gratification, stripping them of their humanity and violating their fundamental rights. Children are entitled to grow up in an environment that respects their dignity and protects them from harm. However, CSEAM violates this right in the most egregious manner possible. 9 Matthew L Long, Laurence A.

The existence and circulation of CSEAM are affronts to the dignity of all children, not just the victims depicted in the material. It perpetuates a culture in which children are seen as objects to be exploited, rather than as individuals with their own rights and agency. This dehumanization is particularly dangerous because it can lead to a broader societal acceptance of child exploitation, further endangering the safety and well-being of children.13 234. Given the severity and far-reaching consequences of child sexual exploitation, there is a clear legal and moral imperative to take strong action against those who produce, distribute, and consume CSEAM. This includes not only criminal penalties for those involved in CSEAM but also preventative measures, such as education and awareness campaigns. Laws must be robust and strictly enforced to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice and that children are protected from further harm.
