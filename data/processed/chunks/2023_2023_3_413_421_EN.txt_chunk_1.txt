By a common dated 18.03.2021, the learned Judge of the High Court of Kerala disposed of both the writ petitions permitting the E writ petitioners to prefer an application for permission under Rule 68 of the Kerala Panchayat Building Rules, 20192 within two weeks and further directing the Secretary of the Panchayat to grant necessary permission subject to the conditions, if any, that may be imposed by the Panchayat.

Challenging the said of the learned Judge, three intra- court appeals came to be filed. One of the intra-court appeals was filed G by the writ petitioners themselves, as they were not satisfied with the outcome.
