His submission is that in the event his transfer plea is not accepted, it would cause inconvenience and undue hardship. It is on this ground he had applied for transfer of his case from the Bench of the Tribunal at Hyderabad to the Bench at Ahmedabad. The matter has reached fi nal stage of hearing in the Tribunal at Hyderabad. That appears to be the main reason for which the Principal Bench of the Tribunal has rejected the petitioner’s transfer application. We do not fi nd any fl aw in such reasoning. In such circumstances, we decline to invoke our jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India in the present matter. 7. The special leave petition is, accordingly, dismissed. 8. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by : SLP dismissed. Divya Pandey
