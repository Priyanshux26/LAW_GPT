By the impugned , the High Court has allowed the appeal, set aside the of the First Appellate Court, and restored that of the Trial Court. The findings recorded by the High Court are as follows: (i) The Appellant-State failed to establish possession over the land in suit. (ii) The basic ingredients for claiming adverse possession were neither pleaded nor any evidence led in that regard. (iii) The pleadings in the written statement filed by the appellant-State did not mention the details regarding the date of possession, date of knowledge to the whole world, duration of possession, and much less Animus Possidendi. 2440 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 10. It is this of the High Court which is under challenge in the present appeal. 11. Sri Sanjay R. Hegde, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant made the following submissions:- (i) The suit for possession filed by the respondents, was clearly barred by time in view of Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which provides the limitation for a suit for possession of an immovable property based on title to be 12 years. In the present case, the possession of the appellants was since 1958, even the admitted position by the respondents to their knowledge was from 1981. As such, the suit filed in the year 2001 was hopelessly barred by time from both the dates i.e. 1958 as also 1981. (ii) The burden to prove ownership would lie on the person challenging the ownership of the person in possession in view of Section 110 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. In the present case, the respondents admitted the possession of the appellants and were only challenging the ownership of the appellants. As such, the burden was cast upon the respondents to prove their ownership. (iii) The appellants had claimed to be in possession of the land in suit since 1958 and had also asserted that it had constructed a Veterinary Hospital soon thereafter, for which it had also filed documentary evidence. Sri Inder Singh, the predecessor in interest of the plaintiff-respondent, who had donated the land in suit for construction of Veterinary Hospital, never challenged the same nor ever objected to the constructions being raised over it. He was the owner in possession of the suit land. The appellants, being in clear and continuous possession of the suit land since 1958, had perfected its rights as owners. (iv) In support of his submission, Sri Hegde, relied upon the following s:- (1) Chuharmal Vs. CIT;1 (2) Ramchandra Sakharam Mahajan Vs. Damodar Trimbak Tanksale (D);2 1 [1988] 3 SCR 788 : (1988) 3 SCC 588 2 [2007] 8 SCR 178 : (2007) 6 SCC 737 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2441 The State of Punjab and Ors. v.
