225 Manilal v. The State of Rajasthan & Ors. “Admission to the said post was initiated in terms of advertisement issued in the month of April, 2009. Eligibility for admission was 45% marks at graduation level. Respondent had secured 49.61% marks in his graduation examination. Respondent cleared the Pre-Shiksha Shastri test. Counseling for allotment of colleges on merit cum- preference was notified on 04.07.2009. The respondent deposited the necessary fee on 07.07.2009. First round of counseling was held between 31.07.2009 and 03.08.2009. Second round of counseling was held between 26.08.2009 and 28.08.2009. As per notification dated 21.08.2009, respondent was allotted college for pursuing Shiksha Shastri course 2009-10 and was admitted on 04.09.2009. Clauses 9.3(ii) and 9.3(iii) of the advertisement dated 31.07.2018 read as under: 9.3 The Hon’ble High Court of Rajasthan, Jodhpur Division Bench, in of dated 20.05.2011 passed in various petitions, according to School Education Department, Rajasthan letter number F 7(1) E.E/ Plan/2011 dated 17 June, 2011 and clarification dated 16.09.2013, the following candidates would be eligible to participate in Rajasthan Primary and Upper Primary School Teachers Direct Recruitment, 2018:- (i) All such candidates who have taken admission in teacher training courses before issuance of notification dated 27.09.2007 of the National Teachers Education Council, they are not obliged to obtain minimum percentage marks at bachelors level or equivalent examination. (ii) All such candidates who have taken admission in teacher training courses after issuance of notification dated 27.09.2007 of National Teachers Education Council but before issuance of notification dated 31.08.2009 in teaching training courses, for them it is compulsory to obtain minimum 45 percent marks at graduation level or equivalent examination. 226 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (iii) All such candidates who had taken admission in teachers training courses after issuance of notification of National Teachers Education Council dated 31.08.2009, for them it is compulsory to obtain minimum 50 percent marks at graduation level or equivalent examination. Learned Single Judge rightly observed that the admission of the respondent in the course would relate back to the date of admission after the first round of counselling which took place before 31.08.2009. If that is not so, then an absurd classification of homogeneous group of students admitted in Shiksha Shastri course in the academic session 2009-10 would arise and the same would have no nexus to be achieved. Thus, some students in respondent’s class admitted after first round of counseling would be eligible, even with less than 50% marks in graduation, to be appointed as Teacher Grade-III, Level-Il while the respondent who was also from the same class and admitted through the same process would not be eligible for appointment for the reason of less than 50% marks in graduation. Learned Single Judge rightly held that the said uneven and discriminatory situation between equals (students of Shiksha Shastri class of 2009-10) would be unsustainable and was liable to be declared ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Learned Single Judge then rightly drew the conclusion that Clause 9.3(iii) read with clause 9.3(ii) of the advertisement dated 31.07.2018 entitling eligibility for those with 45% marks at graduation who had substantially undergone the admission process to Shiksha Shastri course and were allotted college for the purpose before 31.08.2009 though admitted later and the case of the respondent would fall in the said category as he had taken admission to Shiksha Shastri course pursuant to advertisement in April, 2009 when notification dated 27.09.2007 was operative and as per the said notification eligibility criteria was 45% marks in graduation course.
