RUNWEELL (INDIA) PVT. LTD. [R.P. (C) No. 428/2023]; d) DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MAHARAJ SINGH [R.P. (C) No. 429/2023]; and e) DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. SURENDER SINGH [R.P. (C) No. 409/2023]. 124. As a fact-finding inquiry is necessary to ascertain the rightful claimant for receiving the compensation, which is to be determined as directed in paragraph 121 supra, we hereby set aside the s of the High Court that were under challenge in the Civil Appeals out of which the aforementioned RPs have arisen. We revive the relevant writ petitions [W.P. (C) No. 5107/2015, W.P. (C) No. 5063/2014, W.P. (C) No. 4780/2014, W.P. (C) No. 1637/2015, W.P. (C) No. 6897/2014], which shall stand restored on the file of the High Court for this limited purpose on remand being ed. The Chief Justice of the High Court is requested to constitute a dedicated bench to decide these writ petitions in the manner indicated hereafter. The nominated bench will accord an opportunity to the landowners/subsequent purchasers, the GNCTD, and the DDA to submit additional documents on affidavits whereupon such bench shall embark on an exercise to decide who [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1009 Govt. of NCT of Delhi Through Its Secretary, Land and Building Department & Another v. M/s K.L. Rathi Steels Limited and Others between the landowner(s) and the subsequent purchaser(s) is the rightful claimant to receive compensation. The nominated bench will have the authority to obtain independent fact-finding enquiry reports, if deemed necessary. The inquiry could include determination as to whether after the Notification under section 4(1) of the 1894 Act, any transfer could have been effected and even if effected, whether such transfer is permitted by any law. Once compensation is determined, the relevant authority in the land acquisition department shall deposit the same with the reference court. The reference court shall then invest the deposited amount in a short-term interest-bearing fixed deposit account with a nationalized bank, ensuring its periodical renewal until the relevant writ petition is disposed of by the nominated bench. Release of the invested amount together with accrued interest to the rightful claimant will be contingent upon the decision of the High Court. Upon enquiry being completed, the High Court shall decide the relevant writ petitions in accordance with law. 125. The directions issued in paragraph 121 supra do not extend to eight miscellaneous matters that were erroneously included in the present batch. These cases shall be listed separately in the week commencing 22nd July, 2024. The details of the cases are as follows: a) In these two cases outlined below, no notice has been issued by this Court for condonation of delay and/or otherwise; hence, they need to be de-tagged and listed separately: i.
