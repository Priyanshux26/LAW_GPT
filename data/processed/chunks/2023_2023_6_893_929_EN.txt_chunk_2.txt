Whether the relief prayed for is time barred or not is for the trial court to decide on the basis of the evidence that the parties may lead. As observed by E the Privy Council in Mohammad Khalil Khan if the evidence to support the two claims is different than the causes of action are also different. Hence, the contention raised on the basis of the provisions of IX Rule 9 of the CPC has no merits. [Para 60][927-B-D] F 5. The matter may also be looked at from a different angle. Assuming for the moment that in the first suit also the plaintiffs had prayed for a relief, seeking redemption of mortgage as prayed for in the present suit. Even in such circumstances, whether with both the reliefs identical in the two suits and the cause of action also the same, the provisions of IX Rule 9 of the CPC G would operate as a bar for the maintainability of the present suit. The right to redeem, is a right conferred upon the mortgagor by an enactment, of which he can only be deprived by means and in manner indicated for that purpose and strictly complied with. If H 896 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A the right of redemption is not extinguished, the provision like IX Rule 9 of the CPC will not debar the mortgagor from filing a second suit because as in a partition suit, the cause of action in a redemption suit is a recurring one. The cause of action in each successive action, until the right of redemption is extinguished or a suit for redemption is time barred, is a different B one.
