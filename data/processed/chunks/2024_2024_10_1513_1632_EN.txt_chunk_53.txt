This automatic invalidation was seen as conflicting with Article 6(1) of the German Basic Law, which protects the right to marry and form a family195. It is a right that is based on the free will, equality and autonomy of the partners and involves special mutual obligations, with the official ceremony of marriage serving to substantiate the marriage through a formal act.196 135. The Court recognised that the invalidation of such marriages not only safeguards minors from the inherent risks associated with marital cohabitation but also enhances the legal options available to guardians. They can determine the living arrangements of married and economic development of women, who are mostly affected. 193 See BVerfG, of the First Senate of 1 February 2023 - 1 BvL 7/18 (Germany). 194 Ibid, Para 44-45. 195 Ibid, Para 107. 196 Ibid, Para 114 -116.

Union of India & Ors. minors without considering their marital status, ensuring that decisions prioritize the child’s best interests under IHRL197. Protecting minors from early marriage aligns with the state’s duty to uphold life and physical integrity under Article 2(2) of the German Basic Law and addresses the need to eliminate disadvantages faced by women. As a result, the court ed the legislature to amend the law by 30 June 2024, to address these gaps, thus providing legal clarity on the status of such marriages and offering a pathway for validation after reaching adulthood.198 This case illustrates the complexities involved in addressing child marriage within Europe, particularly in the context of refugees and migration. While the German law aimed to protect minors, the Federal Constitutional Court emphasized the need for balance. 136. In India, the PCMA protects child brides and any child born from a child marriage by prescribing for their maintenance, residence and custody. Further, any child born from such a marriage is deemed legitimate. These provisions apply even when the marriage has been nullified at the instance of the minor contracting party. India therefore does not have the same legal gap that the Federal Constitutional Court observed in German law. Protections of maintenance, residence and custody under family law are a recognition of the responsibilities that society places on families after marriage. The philosophy is that a law must not merely penalise criminal action – in this case child marriage – but must also compensate and address the harm meted out to the victim. iii. SAARC 137. Child marriage is a significant concern in South Asia, where approximately one in four young women are first married or in union before reaching the age of eighteen.199 The prevalence of child marriage varies greatly across the region, with over 50% of girls married before eighteen in Bangladesh, compared to only 2% in the Maldives.200 Furthermore, even within individual countries, disparities 197 Ibid. 198 Ibid, Para 190-192. 199 UNICEF (2023).
