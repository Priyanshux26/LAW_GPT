iv) The reasoning given by the Courts below that as there was no of cancellation of membership or cessation of the membership, the 7 Objectors would be entitled to notice and the question whether they would be allowed to vote or not would be a separate issue. v) Reliance has been placed upon by Shri Naphade on a of this Court in the case of Hyderabad Karnataka Education Society Versus Registrar of Societies and Others4, where a provision similar to Section 15 of the Registration Act was being considered and this Court held that the provision was valid and a member defaulting in payment of subscription would for all practical purposes be deemed to not be a member entitled to notice. 12. On the other hand, Mr. Hooda has strongly relied upon the reasoning given by the High Court. 4 In [1999] 5 Suppl. SCR 161 : (2000) 1 SCC 566 [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1071 Adv Babasaheb Wasade & Ors. v. Manohar Gangadhar Muddeshwar & Ors. i) He has submitted that it suffers from no infirmity, warranting any interference. ii) The appellants are not entitled to any relief from this Court, as they were not entitled to convene the meeting for the elections. Appellant No.1 was neither Secretary nor President and under the bye-laws, it is the Secretary who would convene the meeting. iii) He further reiterated that the effect of Section 15 of the Registration Act would not be of cancelling the membership of the Objectors. Referring to the Hyderabad Karnataka Education Society (supra) case, Mr. Hooda submitted that in the aforesaid case under the bye-laws there was a provision that if there was a default, the membership would stand cancelled, which is not the case here as there is no such provision under the bye-laws. According to him, the said would be of no help to the appellant as it would not apply to the present case. iv) Lastly, it was submitted that a number of signatories to the requisition dated 20.08.2002 and also elected as executive members on 08.09.2002, were not members of the Society at that time for the reason that either they had retired or were never elected as per the bye-laws. v) Mr. Hooda has further relied upon the following s as part of his submissions: i. Shri Bhaurao Versus Shri Dyaneshwar, in First Appeal No. 1435 of 2017 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, ii. Ramesh Gangadhar Dongre and another vs. Charity Commissioner, Mumbai and others5, iii. Santosh vs. Purushottam6, iv. Shri Sarbjit Singh & Others vs. All India fine Arts & Crafts Society & Others7. 13. Having considered the respective submissions, the following questions arise for consideration: 5 2020(5) Mh.L.J. 6 2017(6) Mh.L.J. 7 ILR (1989) 2 Del 585 1072 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports i) Whether the Working President Mr. Wasade could have convened the election meeting for 08.09.2002 as according to the Objectors, it was only the Secretary or in the alternative the President who could have convened the meeting under the bye-laws?
