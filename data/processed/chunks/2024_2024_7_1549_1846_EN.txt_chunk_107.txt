264 [1981] 2 SCR 364 : (1981) 2 SCC 318 [6-A] 265 See All India Federation of Tax Practitioners v. Union of India (2007) 7 SCC 527 [46] 266 (1942) 4 FCR 90 267 (1995) Supp. 1 SCC 642 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1685 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. 202. This Court held that once Parliament enacts a law under Entry 54 of List I and occupies the field in connection with the regulation of mines and mineral development, the state legislature will lose legislative competence with respect to both Entries 23 and 50 of List II. Further, it was observed that since royalty is a tax, the legislative competence of Parliament to enact Section 9 of the MMDR Act could be traced to both Entries 54 and 97 of List I.268 203. The decision in Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills (supra) was followed by a two judge Bench in Saurashtra Cement (supra).269 In State of Orissa v. Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd.,270 a three judge Bench held that the MMDR Act has made exhaustive provisions for “all kinds of taxation on minerals and mineral rights – tax, royalty – fee – dead rent, etc.” which denudes the state legislature of the power to enact any law or to impose any tax or other levy with reference to Entry 23 or Entry 50 of List II. 204. As discussed in the above segments, the field of tax on mineral rights vests with the state legislature. Parliament cannot impose a tax on mineral rights under Entry 54 of List I. Parliament cannot resort to its residuary powers to tax mineral rights when the subject matter is specifically enumerated in Entry 50 of the State List. The fixation of the rates of royalty under Section 9 can be validly traced to Entry 54 of List I because royalty is not a tax. The fixation of the rates of royalty falls with the regulatory powers of Parliament under Entry 54 of List I. The decisions in Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills (supra), Saurashtra Cement (supra), and Mahanadi Coalfields (supra) do not reflect the correct position of law. 205. Entry 50 of List II is not an exception to the Sundararamier principle which is that taxing entries are enumerated separately from the general entries in Lists I and II of the Seventh Schedule. The field of taxation cannot be derived from regulatory legislative entries and has to be derived from a specified taxing entry. This principle has now been well-entrenched in our constitutional jurisprudence.271 268 Mahalaxmi Fabric (supra) [14] 269 [2000] Supp. 4 SCR 44 : (2001) 1 SCC 91 [11] 270 (1995) Supp. 2 SCC 686 271 Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Association of India v. Union of India (1989) 3 SCC 634 [74]; State of Karnataka v. State of Meghalaya (2023) 4 SCC 416 [66] 1686 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports A legislature has incidental and subsidiary powers with respect to a legislative entry. However, the power to tax is neither incidental nor subsidiary to the power to legislate on a particular matter in the nature of a regulatory entry.272 206.
