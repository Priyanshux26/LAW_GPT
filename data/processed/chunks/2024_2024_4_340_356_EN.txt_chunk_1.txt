[Paras 9, 13, 15, 18, 19] Bombay Stamp Act, 1958 – s.14A – Companies Act, 1956 – s.31(2) – Relying on s.14A of the Stamp Act, the appellant contended that any material or substantial alteration in the character of an instrument requires a fresh stamp duty according to its altered character: Held: s.31(2) was introduced with the intention to confer validity on any alterations to the articles as if they were originally contained therein – Therefore, any increase in the share capital of the company also shall be valid as if it were originally there when the Articles of Association were first stamped – There is no concept of a company having new Articles of Association – Thus, s.14A of the Stamp Act would not be of any help to the appellants. [Para 12] 342 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Interpretation of Statutes – Conflict between general law and special law – Bombay Stamp Act, 1958 – Companies Act, 1956: Held: In case of conflict between two laws, the general law must give way to the special law – A conjoined reading of the Stamp Act and the Companies Act shows that while the former governs the payment of stamp duty for all manner of instruments, the latter deals with all aspects relating to companies and other similar associations – Present case concerns with an instrument which is chargeable to Stamp Duty and finds its origin in the Companies Act – Various provisions of the Companies Act provide the purpose and scope of the instrument – Thus, the Companies Act is the special law and the Stamp Act is the general law with regards to Articles of Association, and the special will override the general.
