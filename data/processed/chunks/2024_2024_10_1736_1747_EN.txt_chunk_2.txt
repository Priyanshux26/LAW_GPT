The learned Single Judge recorded all these statements and dismissed the civil writ petitions as withdrawn on 30.11.2016, besides issuing a direction to release the arrears of pension to the appellants within a period of three months.

Banarsi Dass and Others 3 Hereinafter shortly referred as “the Rules, 2009” 4 Academic Grade Pay 1740 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in the said s dated 30.11.2016 passed by the learned Single Judge in CWP No.8988 of 2015 and connected cases. 5. Between 2017 and 2018, the State disbursed the arrears of revised pension to the appellants. However, they preferred a Review Application bearing No.RA-CW-383-2017, seeking to review the learned Single Judge’s s dated 30.11.2016 passed in CWP No.8988 of 2015 and connected matters, on the premise that payment of interest on the amount of arrears to be paid w.e.f. 01.01.2006 was not justified as the decision to revise the pension in the pay band of Rs. 37400 - 67000 + 9000 AGP was taken and approved by the Government of Haryana, Finance Department, vide U.O.No. 66/5/2016-2FD-II/28139 dated 07.10.2016 and therefore, interest on belated payment of pension was payable not from 01.01.2006 but from 07.10.2016. By dated 16.08.2017, the learned Single Judge dismissed the Review application, with liberty to the State to approach the appellate forum. 6. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the passed in the Review Application, the State preferred LPA(s) before the Division Bench seeking to set aside the s of the learned Single Judge dated 30.11.2016, to the extent of granting payment of interest as clarified on 23.12.2016 in the civil writ petitions and on 16.08.2017 in the review application. The High Court allowed the State’s appeals and set aside the s of the learned Single Judge with respect to grant of interest on delayed payment of revised pension to the appellants, by the common and impugned herein. 7. In the given facts and circumstances of the case, more particularly that the appellants were paid the revised pension with effect from 01.01.2006, the only question to be answered in all these cases is, whether they are entitled to interest on belated payment of revised pension. 8.
