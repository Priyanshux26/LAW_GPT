Digital Supreme Court Reports 76. One another decision interpreting Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act was delivered by a two-judge bench of this Court in Maharashtra Tubes Ltd. v. State Industrial & Investment Corpn. of Maharashtra Ltd. reported in (1993) 2 SCC 144. In this case, this Court, while deciding the interplay between the power of recovery under the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951 and the suspension of certain legal proceedings under Section 22 of the 1985 Act, held thus: “10. It was next contended that the right conferred on the Financial Corporation by Section 29 of the 1951 Act is not a ‘legal proceeding’ but merely an action permitted by statute and, therefore, Section 22(1) will have no application as it only bars legal proceedings for the winding up of any industrial company or for execution, distress or the like against any of its properties or for the appointment of a Receiver in respect thereof. Now Section 22(1) uses the expression ‘proceedings’ and not ‘legal proceedings’ which expression is albeit used in the marginal note to the said provision. Mr Rao contended that Section 22 must be read in the light of the marginal note and when so read it becomes obvious that only legal proceedings of the type mentioned in sub-section (1) thereof are barred and not the exercise of a right such as the one conferred by Section 29 of the 1951 Act. In support of his contention that the marginal note can be used as an aid to interpretation he invited our attention to a seven-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. State of Bihar [(1955) 2 SCR 603, 636 : AIR 1955 SC 661 : (1955) 6 STC 446] . In that case the marginal note to Article 286 of the Constitution was referred to and it was said that it furnished some clue as to the meaning and purpose of the Article. But at the same time the Court pointed out that unlike the marginal notes in the statutes of the British Parliament, the various Articles of the Constitution were passed by the Constituent Assembly with the marginal notes and, therefore, the Court considered it permissible to use the marginal note to understand the meaning and purport of the Article. But so far as statutes are concerned this Court in the case of Board of Muslim Wakfs, Rajasthan v. Radha Kishan [(1979) 2 SCC 468] held in no uncertain [2024] 5 S.C.R. 353 Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v. M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited terms that the weight of the authority was in favour of the view that the marginal note appended to a section cannot be used for construing the section (see paragraph 24 at p. 479). Section 22(1) shorn of the irrelevant part provides that where an appeal under Section 25 relating to an industrial company is pending, then, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, no proceedings for the winding up of the industrial company or for execution, distress or the like against any of the properties of the industrial company or for appointment of a Receiver in respect thereof shall lie or be proceeded with further, except with the consent of the BIFR or, as the case may be, the appellate authority.
