The Respondent No.1 in paragraph 53 of the Plaint clearly stated that he had come to know about the proceedings on 2nd March 2007 only when he was informed about Civil Application No. 1562/2006 in Writ Petition No. 3813 of 1996 filed by Dr. F Wadia. The knowledge of the fact that the Respondent’s right in the suit property has been affected by the proceedings between the Defendants and another on 2nd March 2007 is the crucial date from which the clock starts ticking to determine limitation. Thus, well within the period of limitation, he preferred the Special civil suit against the appellants and another for declaration and possession of the suit properties. 8.3. That apart, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the Respondent No.1 that when an issue requires an inquiry into the facts, it cannot be tried as a preliminary issue. To buttress the same, he placed reliance on the decision in Satti Paradesi Samadhi & Pillayar Temple v. M. Sankuntala,4 wherein, it was held that ‘the court has no jurisdiction to try a suit on mixed issues of law and fact as a preliminary issue’. 8.4. Referring to the decision in Sajjan Sikaria v. Shakuntala Devi Mishra,5 it is submitted by the learned counsel for the Respondent No.1 that while dealing with an application under VII Rule 11 of CPC, there is no requirement to consider the written statement filed by the defendant. That apart, in Saleem Bhai v. State of Maharashtra,6 it was held by this Court that ‘a perusal of VII Rule 11 of CPC makes it clear that the relevant 4 (2015) 5 SCC 674 5 (2005) 13 SCC 687 6 (2003) 1 SCC 557 1454 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports facts which need to be looked into for deciding an application thereunder are the averments in the plaint; the pleas taken by the defendant in the written statement would be wholly irrelevant at that stage; and therefore, a direction to file the written statement without deciding the application under VII Rule 11 of CPC cannot be procedural irregularity touching the exercise of jurisdiction by the trial Court’. 8.5. Considering all these factors, the High Court rightly dismissed the application filed by the appellants under VII Rule 11(d) of CPC, by observing that the plaint cannot be rejected at the threshold, as the issue of limitation is a mixed question of facts and law for which the parties will have to lead evidence. Thus, according to the learned counsel, there is no requirement to interfere with the impugned herein and the appeal filed by the appellants is liable to be dismissed. 9. We have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for both sides and perused the materials available on record. 10. The subject matter of the present proceedings is qua lands in S.Nos.14A/1A/1, 144, 145, 95, 90, 129, 191A (part), 160 (Part), 191 (part), 20, 103(part), 120(part), 141, 233, 94(part), 104 and 105 situated in Yerawada, Taluka Haveli, District Pune.
