if the court is satisfied that such irregularity has not in fact occasioned any failure of justice. There are, no doubt, authorities in India which lend some support to Mr. Pritt’s contention, and reference may be made to 49 ALL. 475 [(’27) 49 All. 475 : 14 A.I.R. 1927 All. 350 : 100 I.C. 371, Tirkha v Nanak], in which the court expressed the view that S. 537, Criminal P.C., applied only to errors of procedure arising out of mere inadvertence, and not to cases of disregard of, or disobedience to, mandatory provisions of the Code, and to 45 Mad. 820 [(’22) 45 Mad. 820 : 9 A.I.R. 1922 Mad. 512 : 71 I.C. 252, In re Madura Muthu Vannian. ], in which the view was expressed that any failure to examine the accused under S. 342, Criminal P.C., was fatal to the validity of the trial and could not be cured under S. 537. In their Lordships’ opinion this argument is 676 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports based on too narrow a view of the operation of S. 537. When a trial is conducted in a manner different from that prescribed by the Code as in 28 I.A. 257 [(’01) 28 I.A. 257 : 25 Mad. 61 : 8 Sar. 160 (P.C. ), Subrahmania Aiyar v. Emperor], the trial is bad, and no question of curing an irregularity arises; but if the trial is conducted substantially in the manner prescribed by the Code, but some irregularity occurs in the course of such conduct, the irregularity can be cured under S. 537, and none the less so because the irregularity involves, as must nearly always be the case, a breach of one or more of the very comprehensive provisions of the Code. The distinction drawn in many of the cases in India between an illegality and an irregularity is one of degree rather than of kind. This view finds support in the decision of their Lordships’ Board in 5 Rang. 53 [(‘26) 5 Rang. 53 : 14 A.I.R. 1927 P.C. 44 :54 I.A. 96 : 100 I.C. 227 (P.C. ), Abdul Rahman v. Emperor], where failure to comply with Ss. 360, Criminal P.C., was held to be cured by Ss. 535 and 537. The present case falls under S. 537, and their Lordships hold the trial valid notwithstanding the breach of S. 162.” (emphasis supplied) RE-TRIAL Section 386 of the CrPC, 1973 “386. Powers of the Appellate Court.—After perusing such record and hearing the appellant or his pleader, if he appears, and the Public Prosecutor if he appears, and in case of an appeal under section 377 or section 378, the accused, if he appears, the Appellate Court may, if it considers that there is no sufficient ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal, or may— (a) in an appeal from an of acquittal, reverse such and direct that further inquiry be made, or that the accused be re-tried or committed for trial, as the case may be, or find him guilty and pass sentence on him according to law; [2024] 5 S.C.R.
