He had given his report on 02.12.1978 stating that property in possession of the respondents was 434 ft. away from Nala. The report did not even mention about Khasra No.4833. No pucca points were mentioned. It was as B vague as possible. The decree attained finality. PRESENT LITIGATION 16. The Trust filed a Civil Suit No. 273 of 1989 on 26.5.1982 for possession. The main reliance of the respondents was on the report of the Local Commissioner submitted in earlier Suit No. 371/1981 filed by C the respondents. A perusal of the report of the Local Commissioner dated 2.12.1978 shows that the pucca points were not ascertained before carrying out the measurements. In the abvoesaid report, where Kanoongo was the Local Commissioner, the finding was given that the property in dispute was located 434 ft. beyond naala. The site plan was also annexed D with the report in which except showing the road and a naala, no khasra numbers were mentioned to identify the property properly. The fact that there was already a report of Local Commissioner dated 19.1.1975 pertaining to the same property, was not even referred to. This was a report by the Local Commissioner appointed in the Execution Proceedings filed by the predecessor-in-interest of the appellant, in which predecessor- E in-interest of the respondents were also party. This report inspires confidence as before carrying demarcation of the property pucca points were marked and specific khasra no.4833 was measured. Proper plan is also annexed with the aforesaid report. 17. The stand taken by the defendants in the present suit was that F they are in possession for the last 34 years. The suit property is not part of Khasra No. 4833 and further that they had become owners of the property by way of adverse possession. The suit was finally decreed in favour of the appellants. In para 13 of the , the trial court recorded the statement made by the learned counsel appearing for the defendants G that the suit property is part of Khasra No. 4833. The same reads as under :- “13. During the course of arguments, Sh. T.P.S. Bedi Adv. has conceded this fact that the disputed site is part of Khasra No. 4833. No doubt, he has at one stage argued that the identity of the H 372 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A property is not established but since he has conceded this fact that the disputed site is part of Khasra No. 4833 there is no necessity to look into the evidence that it is not within Khasra No. 4833.” 18. As far as the plea raised by the defendants therein regarding B they becoming the owner of the property by way of adverse possession, the finding was that in the earlier litigation, the defendants had already lost on that ground alone (Ref. Suit No. 371/1981). The aforesaid two facts clearly established the identity of the property. 19. Another fact which clearly establishes that it was the admitted C case of the respondents herein that the property in dispute is part of Khasra No.
