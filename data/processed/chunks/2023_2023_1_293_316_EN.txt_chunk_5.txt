THE BROAD QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION G 6. As the Ex-communication Act has been repealed, the question which arises for consideration is whether anything survives in the writ petition for a decision on merits. If we come to the conclusion that the 1(1962) Suppl. (2) SCR 496 : AIR 1962 SC 853 H 2 2005 (2) SCC 673 CENTRAL BOARD OF DAWOODI BOHRA COMMUNITY 301 v. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA [ABHAY S. OKA, J.] writ petition still survives for consideration, the question which will arise A is whether the view taken in the case of Sardar Syedna1 needs reconsideration. SUBMISSIONS 7. We have heard the parties on the aforesaid questions. Shri B Siddharth Bhatnagar, the learned senior counsel representing the petitioners pointed out that the Constitution Bench has held that the practice of Baraat/ex-communication in the Dawoodi Bohra community falls within the ambit of “matters of religion” under clause (b) of Article 26 of the Constitution of India. He urged that even if the Ex-communication Act is repealed, the question whether the practice of C ex-communication falls within the ambit of “matters of religion”, needs to be decided. His submission is that the 2nd Respondent – Syedna Mufaddal (53rd Dai-al-Mutlaq) is not only the religious Head but also the Trustee of the community property. Therefore, he has to perform acts that are not wholly religious. His submission is that even assuming that the practice of ex-communication is considered a matter of religion, it D must yield to the legislations on social reforms which are protected by Article 25(2) of the Constitution of India. He urged that the rights guaranteed under Article 26 are subject to morality. He submitted that the concept of morality under Articles 25 and 26 would subsume within itself the concept of Constitutional morality. He relied upon the decisions E of this Court in the cases of Manoj Narula v. Union of India3, State (NCT of Delhi) v. Union of India & Anr.4 and Navtej Singh Johar & Ors. v. Union of India5and submitted that the concept of Constitutional morality has been elaborated under these decisions. He also pressed into service a decision of this Court in the case of Indian Young Lawyers Association & Ors. v. State of Kerala & Ors.6 (Sabrimala Temple F 5JJ), which according to him, holds that practices destructive of liberty and those which make some citizens less equal than others cannot be countenanced. He would also submit that Article 26 cannot override the protections afforded under other provisions of Part III of the Constitution of India. His submission is that the practice of ex-communication in the G Dawoodi Bohra community is violative of Articles 17, 19(1)(a), 19(1)(c) 32014 (9) SCC 1 42018 (8) SCC 501 52018 (10) SCC 1 62019 (11) SCC 1 H 302 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A and 19(1)(g), 21 and 25 and therefore, it cannot enjoy the protection of Article 26 of the Constitution of India. 8. The learned senior counsel also urged that the Social Boycott Act does not afford any protection against ex- communication as it seeks to prohibit the social boycott of a member of the community by the Khap B Panchayat of the community.
