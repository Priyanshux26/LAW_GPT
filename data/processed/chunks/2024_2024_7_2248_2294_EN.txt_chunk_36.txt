No as to costs. V. Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6819 of 2023 (Vijayadevi Navalkishore Bhartia & Ors. vs. The State of Maharashtra & Anr.) and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2892 of 2023 (The Executive Engineer Vs. Smt. Vijayadevi Navalkishore Bhartia & Ors.) 110. Leave granted in both the matters. 111. These Appeals are similar to Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) 2324 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6817 of 2023. The only difference being that the land is situated in Survey No. 6 and Survey No. 7 in Akoli (kd) and measures 26016.59 sq. ft. Section 4 notification under the Act was dated 21.07.2000; and Section 6 notification of the Act was dated 02.02.2001. The Special Land Acquisition Officer published the award on 27.06.2002 @ of Rs. 96364/- per hectare. On 20.04.2006, the Reference Court allowed LAC No. 53/2005 and granted Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. The High Court has dismissed the First Appeal No. 384/2006 filed by the claimant and First Appeal No. 621/2006 filed by the respondents. Both parties have relied on the arguments raised in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2324 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) 2294 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports No. 6817 of 2023 and as such whatever has been held therein holds good for these Appeals also. In view of the above, both the Civil Appeals are dismissed. No as to costs. VI. Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6820 of 2023 (Smt. Taradevi Chimanlalji Bhartia & Ors. Vs. The State of Maharashtra & Anr.) and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2753 of 2023 (The Executive Engineer Vs. Smt. Taradevi Chimanlalji Bhartia & Ors.) 112. Leave granted in both the matters. 113. The claimants filed First Appeal No. 282 of 2005 and the State filed First Appeal No. 155 of 2005 arising out of LAC No. 183/2000. The facts are same as in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6817 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2324 of 2023. The slight difference being the area involved i.e. plot area of 15562 sq. ft. and open sub divided area of 9464 sq. ft. On 03.06.1999, Section 4 notification under the Act was issued and Section 6 notification under the Act was issued on 02.12.1999. On 04.08.2000, the LAO made award @ of Rs. 5,61,000/- per hectare. On a reference being filed, the Reference Court in LAC No. 183/2000 awarded compensation @ of Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. Both the claimants and the State filed Appeals. We have already in this affirmed the findings in LAC No. 183/2002 out of which these Appeals arise. By the impugned , the High Court confirmed the of the Reference Court. Arguments are similar, hence, whatever has been held in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6817 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.
