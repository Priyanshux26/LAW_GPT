[K.V.VISWANATHAN, J.] on which he /she attains temporary status after continuous service of four months if the same is followed by his/her regular absorption. Otherwise, it should be the date on which he/she is regularly appointed/ absorbed. This applies to substitute teachers also who attain the temporary status after a continuous service of three months only.” 40. A reading of the above clearly shows that on completion of three months of continuous service as substitute teacher, the incumbent acquires temporary status. It is also clear that substitutes who have acquired temporary status should be screened by the Screening Committee and not by Selection Board. It is also clear that under Clause 5.11, gaps which may occur in service of substitutes between two engagements should be ignored for the purpose of temporary status on completion of four months service and in case of teachers, on completion of three months service. Further, it is clear that the date of appointment should be the date on which they attained temporary status in the event they are regularly absorbed. As is clear from the dates mentioned hereinbelow that the appellant having acquired temporary status on 04.03.1990 is entitled to count his service from 04.03.1990 in view of his absorption in the service as a primary teacher on 02.01.1998. 41. The authorities are wrong in stating that in the case of the appellant this Court had not directed any specifi c regarding continuity of service. This Court’s of 15.02.1996 has to be read with the in the case of Smt. Jayasree Deb Roy (Dutta) dated 13.10.1995. Nowhere in the of this Court in the appellant’s appeal had the benefi ts available to the appellant under the Master Circular been taken away. In the case of Smt. Jayasree Deb Roy (Dutta), by abundant caution, the Master Circular was referred to and the rights granted therein were reiterated expressly in this Court’s . On the facts of the present case, we are not persuaded to accept the contention of the respondent that the of this Court in the appellant’s case should be so read as having denied him the benefi ts of Master Circular dated 29.01.1991. 42. The appellant being identically situated with the other absorbees in the of 02.01.1998 could not have been discriminated and denied the benefi t of his service from 04.03.1990 to the date of his absorption. 270 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 43. The Tribunal and the High Court have grossly erred in denying the relief by wrongly understanding the s of this Court and the legal position. 44. We direct that the appellant will be entitled to take into account the past service rendered by him as substitute teacher in diff erent spells, from the date of obtaining temporary status (04.03.1990). The appellant should be extended the same benefi ts as were extended to others, who were granted continuity by the letter of 28.12.1998. 45. The appellant has superannuated now. The pay of the appellant shall be re-fi xed after granting continuity of service with all consequential benefi ts in accordance with Clause 6 of the Master Circular dated 29.01.1991.
