On the request of both parties this case was taken up today in National Lok Adalat. Sh. M.P. Sharma Advocate is present with the plaintiff. Defendant is present in person. Compromise application presented on behalf of both parties was taken into consideration. Both parties were identified by Sh.M.P. Sharma Advocate. Case record was perused. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1221 Mukesh v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. It appears from the perusal of case records that according to compromise application, this suit is admitted by Def. No.1. Plaintiff is in possession over Land Survey No.2087/2088/9/1/1/ measuring 0.076 Ares situated at Village Kheda. Defendant shall not interfere with the possession of plaintiff over aforesaid lands. Plaintiff shall be entitled to get his name recorded in revenue records over aforesaid lands in place of defendant. Both parties have expressed to have voluntarily entered into this compromise. Therefore, this compromise is hereby allowed as per Ex.P-1. In context of compromise, both parties have got their statements recorded. Decree be prepared in accordance with compromise. Compromise shall be an integral part of this decree.…” In view of the above, the appellant is entitled to possession of the subject land and the Respondent No.2 shall not interfere with the same; and the appellant is entitled to get his name recorded in the revenue records in respect of the subject land in the place of the Respondent No.2. Pertinently, it is to be pointed out that the said compromise decree has not been challenged by the Respondent No.1 before any Court of law and hence, the same attained finality and is binding on the parties. 9. It is further seen that on the strength of the compromise decree passed by the civil court, the appellant approached the Tehsildar for mutation of the subject land in his favour. However, the Tehsildar referred the case to the Collector of Stamps, who after examination, determined the stamp duty under Article 22 of Schedule IA of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and directed the appellant to pay a sum of Rs.6,67,500/- in the Government Treasury. The said of the Collector of Stamps was affirmed by the Board of Revenue, in the revision filed by the appellant. The High Court has also upheld the s so passed by the authorities below, by dated 06.12.2019, which is impugned in this appeal. 10. Evidently, the High Court passed the impugned by observing that the compromise decree needs registration and stamp duty is also required to be paid for mutation of the subject land. While so, reliance was made on its earlier dated 24.07.2019 in M.P.No.3634 of 2019 (Siddhulal case), in which, two decisions were referred to, viz., 1222 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (i)the of this Court in Bhoop Singh (supra) and (ii)the passed by the High Court dated 13.02.2017 in W.P.No.2170 of 2015 in Mohd. Yusuf (supra). It is worth mentioning at this juncture that the said of the High Court dated 13.02.2017 in W.P.No.2170 of 2015 was subsequently, challenged by filing Civil Appeal No.800 of 20208 and this Court vide dated 05.02.20109, after having found that pre-existing right through adverse possession existed, has categorically held that a compromise decree does not require registration and accordingly, set aside the said of the High Court.
