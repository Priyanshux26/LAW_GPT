Constitution of India – Article 141 – Decision in Pawan Gupta challenged by appellant by fi ling appeals before Supreme Court which were dismissed without any reasons being recorded – Review petitions there against were also dismissed – Article 141, if attracted: Held: Dismissal of the appeal in the case of Pawan Gupta without any reasons being recorded would not attract Article 141 as no law was declared by the Supreme Court, which will have a binding eff ect on all courts and tribunals in India – There is a clear distinction between the binding law of precedents in terms of Article 141 and the doctrine of merger and res judicata – passed by this Court dismissing the appeal in the case of Pawan Gupta would operate as res judicata in the said case but does not lay down a binding precedent applicable to other cases – It would not operate as res judicata in the case of the respondents against the appellant as they were not parties to the said case, and the proceedings initiated by Pawan Gupta were fact specifi c and not in a representative capacity – Thus, the of this Court in Pawan Gupta cannot be read as a precedent and applied to the 1118 EXPERION DEVELOPERS PVT. LTD. v. HIMANSHU 1119 DEWAN AND SONALI DEWAN cases in hand – Precedents cannot decide questions of fact – In Pawan Gupta there was no material on record placed by the appellant showing the actual increase in the sale area – However, the appellant in the instant case had produced the Architect’s certifi cates and reports to show that there was an actual increase in the sale area, justifying its demand for the extra payment and which documents were not contradicted by the respondents nor had they disputed the contents thereof – The decision in the case of Pawan Gupta was based on evidence adduced by the appellant-builder/developer, which was not found to be suffi cient and cogent to justify and substantiate the demand raised in view of the increased sale area – National Commission was therefore required to consider and examine the contentions of the appellant and not overrule the same on the grounds of the principle of res judicata and on the rule of binding precedent, which do not apply – Impugned set aside – Matter remanded back in terms of the observations and directions given – Doctrine of merger – Res judicata – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – XLI, r.27 – Consumer Protection.
