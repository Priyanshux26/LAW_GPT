It is only the execution of the sale deed that transfers title to the property.” 7. In Kartik Chandra Pal v. Dibakar Bhattacharjee [AIR 1952 Cal 362 : ILR (1950) 1 Cal 350] a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court, however, after reviewing a number of reported cases viz. Ranjit Singh v. Kalidasi Debi [ILR (1910) 37 Cal 57 : 14 Cal WN 527 : 5 IC 205], Madanmohan Singh v. Gaja Prasad Singh [(1911) 14 CLJ 159 : 11 IC 228], Deonandan Prasad v. Janki Singh [(1920) 5 Pat LJ 314 : 1 Pat LT 325 : 56 IC 322] and Atal Behary Acharya v. Barada Prasad Banerji [AIR 1931 Pat 179 : 12 Pat LT 636 : 131 IC 529], observed: [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1307 Rohit Kochhar v. Vipul Infrastructure Developers Ltd. & Ors. “...It is incontestable that in a suit for specific performance of contract for the sale of land it is open to the plaintiff to join in the same suit two prayers, one for the execution of the deed of transfer and another for recovery of possession of the land in question.... * * * We ought to remember in this connection that no special form of decree in a suit for specific performance is supplied by the Civil Procedure Code. Chapter II, Specific Relief Act, deals with the various circumstances under which a contract may be enforced specifically and where it cannot be allowed. When a contract is to be specifically enforced, it means simply this that when the parties do not agree to perform the contract mutually the intervention of the Court is required and the Court will do all such things as the parties would have been bound to do had this been done without the intervention of the Court. A sale of a property after payment of the consideration and upon due execution of the deed of sale presupposes and requires the vendor to put the purchaser in possession of the property. It cannot be suggested that when a party comes to Court for the specific performance of a contract he is to be satisfied with simply the execution of the document on payment of the consideration money. The Court when allowing the prayer for specific performance vests the executing court with all the powers which are required to give full effect to the decree for specific performance. By the decree for specific performance, the Court sets out what it finds to be the real contract between the parties and declares that such a contract exists and it is for the executing court to do the rest. It may be noticed further that a decree in a suit for specific performance has been considered to be somewhat in the nature of preliminary decree which cannot set out in the fullest detail all the different steps which are required to be taken to implement the main portion of the directing specific performance of 1308 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the contract.
