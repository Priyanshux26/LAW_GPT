In Anwar Ali and Anr. v. State of Himachal Pradesh: (2020) 10 SCC 166, this Court has referred to C and relied upon the principles enunciated in previous decisions and has laid down as under: - “24. Now so far as the submission on behalf of the accused that in the present case the prosecution has failed to establish and prove the motive and therefore the accused deserves acquittal is D concerned, it is true that the absence of proving the motive cannot be a ground to reject the prosecution case. It is also true and as held by this Court in Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of Bihar10 that if motive is proved that would supply a link in the chain of circumstantial evidence but the absence thereof cannot be a ground to reject the prosecution case. However, at the same time, E as observed by this Court in Babu11, absence of motive in a case depending on circumstantial evidence is a factor that weighs in favour of the accused. In paras 25 and 26, it is observed and held as under:- “25. In State of U.P. v. Kishanpal12, this Court examined F the importance of motive in cases of circumstantial evidence and observed: ‘38. … the motive is a thing which is primarily known to the accused themselves and it is not possible for the prosecution to explain what actually promoted or excited G them to commit the particular crime. 39. The motive may be considered as a circumstance which is relevant for assessing the evidence but if the 10 1995 Supp (1) SCC 80:1995 SCC (Cri) 60. 11 (2010) 9 SCC 189: (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 1179. H 12 (2008) 16 SCC 73: (2010) 4 SCC (Cri) 182. PREM SINGH v. STATE OF NCT OF DELHI 849 [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] evidence is clear and unambiguous and the circumstances A prove the guilt of the accused, the same is not weakened even if the motive is not a very strong one……...’ 26. This Court has also held that the absence of motive in a case depending on circumstantial evidence is a factor that weighs in favour of the accused. (Vide Pannayar v. State of T.N.13).”” B Application of the relevant principles to the facts of this case 16. Keeping the aforesaid principles in view, when we examine the facts of this case and the concurrent findings of the Trial Court and the High Court, we find no substance in the contentions urged bylearned C counsel for the appellant. 16.1. It is amply established on record that the deceased children, aged 9 years and 6 years respectively, died an unnatural death and though the bodies were retrieved from canal, it had not been a case of their drowning but, as specifically proved by the post-mortem reports and the testimony of PW-14 Dr. V.K. Jha, the cause of their death had been D asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation. There is nothing on record to disbelieve the testimony of PW-14 Dr. V.K.
