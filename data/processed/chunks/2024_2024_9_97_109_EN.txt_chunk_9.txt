24. Furthermore, we refrain from imposing any exemplary costs on either party, recognizing that both have contributed to the situation at hand. It is also to be noted that the ADA, being a civic body tasked with serving the public and operating on a non-profit basis, should not be unduly penalized in a manner that could impede its functioning. 25. The Civil Appeals 2809-2810 of 2024 are disposed of accordingly. 26. The appeal filed by the ADA i.e. Civil Appeal No. 6344 of 2024 stands dismissed, as its primary arguments regarding both limitation and pecuniary jurisdiction are found to be without merit. Result of the case: Civil Appeal Nos. 2809-2810 disposed of; Civil Appeal No. 6344 of 2024 dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
