6. When the Liquidator did not receive any bid in the first auction, he published a notice scheduling a second auction on 23rd December, 2019. This time, the reserve price was reduced by 25% i.e. it came down from ₹39,41,28,500/- (Rupees Thirty nine crore forty one lakh twenty eight thousand five hundred only) to ₹29,55,96,375/- (Rupees Twenty nine crore, fifty five lakh ninety six thousand three hundred and seventy five only). M/s KMC Speciality Hospitals (India) Limited was the sole bidder in the second auction process and on depositing an earnest amount of ₹2,95,59,698/- (Rupees Two crore ninety five lakh fifty nine thousand six hundred and ninety eight only), it emerged as the successful bidder. 7. In terms of Rule 12 of Schedule-I under Regulation 33 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016,15 the successful bidder was required to pay the balance sale consideration within 90 days from the date of demand. The Liquidator despatched a letter dated 24th December, 2019 to the Auction Purchaser demanding the balance sale amount. Though arguments were initially advanced on behalf of the appellant that the period of 90 days for paying the balance amount ought to be reckoned from 24th December, 2019 and not from 26th December, 2019, the date on which the Auction Purchaser received the communication from the Liquidator, later on the said plea was not seriously pressed. If one takes the outer limit for calculating the period of 90 days for the Auction Purchaser to pay the balance sale consideration reckoned from 26th December, 2019, the date when the Auction Purchaser received the letter despatched by the Liquidator, the said period would have expired on 25th March, 2020. It is not in dispute that the balance sale consideration was not paid by the Auction Purchaser within the period of 90 days. The said amount was paid only on 24th August, 2020. 15 IBBI Regulations, 2016 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1273 V.S. Palanivel v. P. Sriram, CS, Liquidator, Etc. 8.
