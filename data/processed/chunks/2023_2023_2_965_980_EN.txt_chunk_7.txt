Be that as it may, the principle is quality over quantity of witnesses. [Mrinal Das Vs. State of Tripura (2011) 9 SCC 479] 17.2 Effect of omissions, deficiencies: Evidence examined as a whole, must reflect/ring of truth. The G court must not give undue importance to omissions and discrepancies which do not shake the foundations of the prosecution’s case. [Rohtash Kumar Vs. State of Haryana (2013) 14 SCC 434; Bhagwan Jagannath Markad Vs. State of Maharashtra (2016) 10 SCC 537; and Karan Singh Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (2022) 6 SCC 52] H RAVASAHEB @ RAVASAHEBGOUDA ETC. v. STATE OF 975 KARNATAKA [SANJAY KAROL J.] 17.3. Reliance on single witness: A If a witness is absolutely reliable then conviction based thereupon cannot be said to be infirm in any manner. [Karunakaran Vs. State of Tamil Nadu (1976) 1 SCC 434; and Sadhuram Vs. State of Rajasthan (2003) 11 SCC 231] B 17.4. Testimony of a close relative: A witness being a close relative is not a ground enough to reject his testimony. Mechanical rejection of an even “partisan” or “interested” witness may lead to failure of justice. The principle of “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus” is not one of general application. [Bhagwan C Jagannath Markad Vs. State of Maharashtra (2016) 10 SCC 537] 17.5 Preponderance of probabilities: To entitle a person to the benefit of a doubt arising from a duality of views, the possible view in favour of the accused must be as nearly reasonably probable as that against him. [Gopal Reddy Vs. State of D Andhra Pradesh (1979) 1 SCC 355] 17.6 Delay in sending FIR: Unless serious prejudice is caused, mere delay in sending the FIR to the Magistrate would not, by itself, have a negative effect on the case of the prosecution. [[State of Rajasthan Vs. Doud Khan (2016) 2 E SCC 607] One of the external checks against ante-dating or ante- timing an FIR is the time of its dispatch to the Magistrate or its receipt by the Magistrate. A dispatch of a copy of the FIR forthwith ensures that there is no manipulation or interpolation in the FIR. [Mehraj Vs. State of F U.P. (1994) 5 SCC 188; and Ombir Singh Vs. State of U.P. (2020) 6 SCC 378] 17.7 Last seen theory : On its own, last seen theory is considered to be a weak basis for G conviction. However, when the same is coupled with other factors such as when the deceased was last seen with the accused, proximity of time to the recovery of the body of deceased etc. The accused is bound to give an explanation under Section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872. If he does not do so, or furnishes what may be termed as wrong explanation or if a motive is established – pleading securely to the conviction of the H 976 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A accused closing out the possibility of any other hypothesis, then a conviction can be based thereon. [Satpal Singh Vs. State of Haryana (2018) 6 SCC 610; and Ram Gopal Vs. State of M.P.
