[Paras 9, 13, 14, 17 and 18] Election – Election Petition – Scope of interference – Plea of the respondent that there is no uniformity in the opinion expressed by the witness with regard to the custom followed by the Mishmi tribe: Held: In the scope available to this Court in an election petition it would not be appropriate for this Court to either examine the customary right or the right to inheritance – It would be appropriate only to notice as to whether in the facts and circumstances of the case where the appellant herself has no claim to the properties after the succession has opened, the non-mentioning of the properties as belonging to that of the spouse was a substantial defect.
