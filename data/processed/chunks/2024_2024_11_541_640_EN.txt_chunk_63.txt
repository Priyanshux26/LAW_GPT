Factors67 contributing to road accidents include careless driving, speeding, poor road design, and failure to adhere to traffic laws. Other significant contributors are mobile phone usage, fatigue, and non-compliance with seat belt or helmet regulations. 123. Driving a motor vehicle is a complex task requiring both practical skills and theoretical knowledge. Safe driving involves not only technical vehicle control68 but also proficiency in various road conditions, including managing speed,69 turns, and spatial awareness relative to other vehicles. Additionally, handling road gradients demands skill, particularly with brakes70 and maneuvering. Effective driving requires awareness of road signs, adherence to traffic rules,71 and a focus on the road free from distractions. The core skills expected of all drivers apply universally, regardless of whether the vehicle falls into transport or non-transport categories. 124. At this juncture, it is also essential to note the scheme72 devised in accordance with Section 75 of MV Act whereby the pre-requisites in the form of ‘General Conditions’ to be maintained by the ‘holder of license’ ensure safety and compliance. Certain guidelines73 have also been enacted in so far as aggregators are concerned whereby chapters outlining ‘Conditions for grant of licence for Aggregator’, ‘Compliance with regard to Drivers’, ‘Compliance with regard to Vehicles’ as also ‘Compliances to ensure safety’ further address the speculative concerns raised on behalf of the counsel for insurance companies. G. CONCLUSION 125. The licensing regime under the MV Act and the MV Rules, when read as a whole, does not provide for a separate endorsement for 67 WHO(2023) Global Status Report on Road Safety India 2023 Country profile https://www.who.int/ publications/m/item/road-safety-ind-2023-country-profile 68 See MV Rules, Rule 31, Part D Vehicle Mechanism and Repairs 69 See MV Act, Section 112 Limits of Speed 70 See MV rules, Rule 31, Part A-Driving Theory-I, 71 See MV Rules, Rule 31, Part B-Traffic Education-I and Part F-Traffic Education-II 72 Rent a Cab Scheme, 1989; Vide S.O. 437 (E), dated 12th June, 1989, published in the Gazette of India, Extra.

Digital Supreme Court Reports operating a ‘Transport Vehicle’, if a driver already holds a LMV license. We must however clarify that the exceptions carved out by the legislature for special vehicles like e-carts and e-rickshaws,74 or vehicles carrying hazardous goods,75 will remain unaffected by the decision of this Court. 126. As discussed earlier in this , the definition of LMV under Section 2(21) of the MV Act explicitly provides what a ‘Transport Vehicle’ ‘means’. This Court must ensure that neither provision i.e. the definition under Section 2(21) or the second part of Section 3(1) which concerns the necessity for a driving license for a ‘Transport Vehicle’ is reduced to a dead letter of law. Therefore, the emphasis on ‘Transport Vehicle’ in the licensing scheme has to be understood only in the context of the ‘medium’ and ‘heavy’ vehicles. This harmonious reading also aligns with the objective of the 1994 amendment in Section 10(2) to simplify the licensing procedure.76 127.
