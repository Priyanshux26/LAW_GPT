We are satisfied that the confession was voluntary and was not the result of inducement, threat or promise as contemplated by Section 24 of the Evidence Act, 1872.” H 1044 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 62. Dealing with the situation of retraction from the extra-judicial confession made by an accused, the Court in Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod v. State of Gujarat [(2009) 5 SCC 740 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 881] held as under: (SCC pp. 772-73, para 53) B “53. It appears therefore, that the appellant has retracted his confession. When an extra-judicial confession is retracted by an accused, there is no inflexible rule that the court must invariably accept the retraction. But at the same time it is unsafe for the court to rely on the retracted confession, unless, the court on a consideration of the entire evidence comes to a C definite conclusion that the retracted confession is true.” 63. Extra-judicial confession must be established to be true and made voluntarily and in a fit state of mind. The words of the witnesses must be clear, unambiguous and should clearly convey that the accused is the perpetrator of the crime. The extra-judicial D confession can be accepted and can be the basis of conviction, if it passes the test of credibility. The extra-judicial confession should inspire confidence and the court should find out whether there are other cogent circumstances on record to support it. [Ref. Sk. Yusuf v. State of W.B. [(2011) 11 SCC 754 : (2011) 3 SCC (Cri) E 620] (SCC pp. 762-63, para 28) and Pancho v. State of Haryana [(2011) 10 SCC 165 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 223] . ]” 13. From the evidence of PW-2, we find that it cannot be said that the extra-judicial confession is one which could be found to be credible. There appears to be no reason as to why the accused persons would go F 100 kms. away and confess to him. Apart from that, his conduct also appears to be unnatural. Though IO Amritpal Singh (PW-11) was known to him and the telephone which was installed in his house was in a working condition, he did not find it necessary to inform him through telephone. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the courts below have erred in relying on the extra-judicial confession made to PW-2. G 14. That leaves with us another circumstantial evidence, i.e. the accused was last seen in the company of the deceased and the deceased was found dead shortly thereafter. In this respect, the prosecution relies on the evidence of complainant Tapinder Singh (PW-3) and Jagtar Singh (PW-9). PW-3 is the step-son of appellant Manjit Kaur. He has himself H PRITINDER SINGH @ LOVELY v. THE STATE OF PUNJAB 1045 [B. R. GAVAI, J.] admitted in his evidence that the relations between him and appellant A Manjit Kaur were strained. As per his version, there used to be a quarrel between Ravinder Singh and appellant Manjit Kaur. He has stated that Ravinder Singh used to give beatings to Manjit Kaur.
