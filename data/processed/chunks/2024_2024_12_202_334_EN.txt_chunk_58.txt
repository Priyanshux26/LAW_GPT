Similarly, officers working in the coast guard or the navy may also be given such powers as they may be involved in anti-smuggling operations. 123. The Board has notified entrustment of powers to various officers working in different departments either under the State services or Central services from time to time. An illustration of this is M.F.(D.R.) Notification No. 161-Cus. dated the 22.06.1963 which empowered specified officers of DRI with the power to search premises. It is worth noting that this notification under Section 6 was issued prior to the notification no. 17/2002 dated 07.03.2002. 124. Notification No. 17/2002 dated 07.03.2002 was issued under Section 4(1) of the Act appointing DRI officers as officers of customs. The powers of officers of customs to discharge duties under the Act is derived from Section 5. 125. A plain reading of Section 6 of the Act, 1962 referred to above, makes it abundantly clear that it applies only to officers from departments other than the officers of the customs under Section 4 of the Act, 1962. The officers of DRI are not any other officers of the Central Government or the State Government or the local authority to be entrusted with the functions of the Board and the Customs Officers. It has been rightly observed by the High Court of Madras in M/s N.C. Alexander (supra) that post 07.03.2002, a notification of the Central Government under Section 6 is not required to recognise the officers from DRI as officers of customs. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 293 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. 126. The observations of the High Court in M/s N.C. Alexander (supra) in the aforesaid context with which we are in complete agreement are reproduced hereinbelow: “269. By such entrustment, these officers of other Departments do not become Officers of Customs. They can merely function as such officers. Since entrustment under Section 6 is on the officers from other department, the Parliament by design has given the powers to the Central Government and not to the Board. 270. As the Officers from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Ministry of Finance (MOF) are already “Officers of Customs” before their induction and deputation to the Board in various Directorates, there is no impediment on their being appointed as proper officers for the purpose of Section 2(34) of the Customs Act, 1962. 271. Merely because the Officers of the Customs and Central Excise Department are selected and are deputed in the respective Directorates does not mean that they cease to be Officers of the respective Departments as these Directorates are created only to assist the Board to implement the object of respective fiscal enactments. It is an internal arrangement within the Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue (DRI). 272. If Section 3 and Section 4 of the Act and the Notification issued thereunder referred to supra were perhaps brought to the attention of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Canon India Private Limited Vs. Commissioner of Customs, 2021 (376) E.L.T.3(S.C.), the Hon’ble Supreme Court would have given a different interpretation.
