In view thereof, the legislative intent has to be interpreted to only exclude S. 69 and 69A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1862 and the same does not affect the applicability of Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1862. 25. It is thus humbly submitted that the arguments and contentions of the Petitioner are liable to be rejected. Various High Courts have consistently held that the right of redemption has to be exercised in terms of S. 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1862 and not u/s 13 (8) of the SARFAESI, 2002 and the amendment to Section 13(8) does not affect or take away this right in any manner. It is therefore respectfully submitted that the present case is not a case warranting exercise of this Hon’ble Court’s jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution.” 121. What can be discerned from the above is that: - (i) It is true the Borrower had assailed the actions of the Bank under the SARFAESI Act before the DRT by way of S.A. No. 46 of 2022. When the 9th Auction notice came to be issued on 1688 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 12.06.2023 which the Borrower alleges to have received on 14.06.2023, the same was also challenged in the aforesaid securitization application by way of I.A. No. 2253 of 2023. (ii) Before the DRT could conclude the proceedings, the Borrower on its own volition moved the High Court by way of its Writ Petition No. 9523 of 2023, wherein the Borrower sought to subsume the entire issue emanating from the S.A. No. 46 of 2022 in the writ petition before the High Court and as a primary relief prayed that either the High Court should decide the same and thereafter allow it to redeem the mortgage or in the alternative the DRT be directed to ultimately decide the issue and then permit it to redeem the mortgage. (iii) Thereafter, in the proceedings before the High Court, the Borrower voluntarily abandoned its aforesaid prayers and waived the right to pursue the S.A. No. 46 of 2022 before the DRT, irrespective of whether it was able to redeem the mortgage or not. In view of the above, the High Court by its impugned permitted the Borrower to redeem the mortgage and directed that within a period of 1-week the S.A. No. 46 of 2022 be withdrawn and further clarified that even if the Borrower failed to withdraw the same, the said application would stand dismissed in light of its and the Borrower would no longer be permitted to litigate any further in respect of the Secured Asset. (iv) When the in Main Appeals was reserved by this Court on 01.07.2023, the aforesaid period of 1-week had already elapsed. The Borrower never withdrew the securitization application. The Borrower in its written submissions before this Court claimed that it had already complied with the terms of the impugned , but conveniently it never withdrew the S.A. No. 46 of 2022 which it was required to.
