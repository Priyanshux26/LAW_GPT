39. It is to be noted that, allowing the petition amounts to revival of illegal and same is not permitted in view of the Apex Court in the matter of Maharaja Chintamani (supra). 40. Considering the above mentioned facts that the Tahasildar as well as the Additional Collector, without following due process of law as required under the said Code, passed the dated 3/12/2008 and 15/01/2009 and handed over possession of the suit property to the Petitioner and in view of the law declared by the Apex Court as stated herein above, I am of the opinion that the Petitioner failed to make out any case for interference with the well reasoned impugned common dated 18/02/2010. 41. Hence, following is passed: a. Rule stands discharged. b. Writ Petitions stand dismissed with cost. 42. At this stage, the learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the interim protection granted by this court to continue for a period of 12 weeks to enable the Petitioner to take chance in higher court. 43. Considering the fact that the Petitioner is in possession of the subject property for last several years and there is a running factory, I am of the opinion that the interim protection granted by this court (Coram : S.

Thereafter, on 19.09.2016, the two special leave petitions came to be filed before this Court. It appears that although the High Court had ed the parties to maintain status quo pending the two writ petitions filed by the appellant, yet on 13.10.2016, i.e., much after the two writ petitions came to be rejected by the High Court, the appellant created a mortgage on the suit property. 9. In such circumstances referred to above, the respondent No. 6 had to file Contempt Petition No. 81 of 2016 in Writ Petition No. 418 of 2016. 10. We were informed that the said contempt petition is pending as on date before the High Court. This Court vide its dated 3.11.2019 directed the Debt Recovery Tribunal – (I) (hereinafter, “DRT”) at Mumbai to proceed to decide the original application filed by the respondent no. 6. These proceedings before the DRT were relating to the Mortgage which came to be created by the appellant herein.
