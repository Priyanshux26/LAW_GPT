4.3 It is next submitted by Shri Nataraj, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the Revenue that while interpreting the amendment to Section 153C by Finance Act, 2015, the following principles / tests need to be kept in mind:- D (i) effect of amendment by substitution; (ii) legislative intent; (iii) Section 153C of the Act, 1961 is a machinery provision; (iv) interpretation which makes the statute or a part of it a “dead E letter” to be avoided; (v) power to legislate includes power to legislate retrospectively. 4.4 Elaborating the above, it is submitted that so far as the effect of amendment to Section 153C is concerned, Section 153C has been amended by way of “substitution”, vide Finance Act, 2015, w.e.f. F 01.06.2015 whereby the words “belongs or belong to” have been substituted by “pertains or pertain to”. That it is a well settled principle of interpretation that any amendment made by way of substitution relates back to the date of the Parent Act. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Shamrao V. Parulekar Vs. District G Magistrate, (1952) 2 SCC 1 :1952 SCR 683. That in the said decision, it is observed and held that an amendment by substitution has the effect of wiping out the earlier provision from the statute book and replacing it with the amended provision as if the unamended provision never existed. Therefore, the statute, which in this case is Section 153C of the Act, 1961 would have to be read as if the amended provision existed from the H 768 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A very inception. Shri Nataraj, learned ASG has also placed reliance on the decision of this Court in the case of Zile Singh Vs. State of Haryana, (2004) 8 SCC 1 (paras 24 and 25). 4.5 It is contended that even while interpreting the amendment to Section 153C by Finance Act, 2015, the legislative intent behind the B amendment is required to be considered. That while interpreting a statute the Court must bear in mind the intention with which the legislation was passed and the mischief it sought to suppress. That the interpretation which best expresses the intention of the legislature should be preferred. That in the present case, the intention of the legislature was to bring within the scope of Section 153C those persons against whom C incriminating material is found at another person’s premises during the search proceedings under Section 132. That, however, the narrow scope given to the words “belongs or belong to” frustrated this purpose and, therefore, the amendment was necessitated. It is submitted that bearing the said legislative intent and the mischief sought to be suppressed in D mind, any interpretation other than that the amended Section 153C will apply to all pending and future proceedings, irrespective of whether the search under Section 132 of the Act, 1961 was before or after the amendment, would fail to advance the object of the legislation. In support of the above submission, Shri Nataraj, learned ASG has relied upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of Zile Singh (supra) (paras 14, 15, E 18 and 20) and Girdhari Lal & Sons Vs. Balbir Nath Mathur, (1986) 2 SCC 237.
