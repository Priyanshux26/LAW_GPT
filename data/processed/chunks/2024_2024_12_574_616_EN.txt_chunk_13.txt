This Court cannot reopen the conclusion already reached but may consider the question of inordinate delay to decide whether the execution of sentence should be carried out or should be altered into imprisonment for life. 45. Keeping a convict in suspense while consideration of his mercy petition by the President for many years is certainly an agony for him/her. It creates adverse physical conditions and psychological stresses on the convict under sentence of death. Indisputably, this Court, while considering the rejection of the clemency petition by the President, under Article 32 read with Article 21 of the Constitution, cannot excuse the agonising delay caused to the convict only on the basis of the gravity of the crime. 46. India has been a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 as well as to the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966. Both these conventions contain provisions outlawing cruel and degrading treatment and/or punishment. Pursuant to the of this Court in Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan [(1997) 6 SCC 241 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 932] , international covenants to which India is a party are a part of domestic law unless they are contrary to a specific law in force. It is this expression (“cruel and degrading treatment [2024] 12 S.C.R. 593 State of Maharashtra & Ors. v. Pradeep Yashwant Kokade & Anr. and/or punishment”) which has ignited the philosophy of Vatheeswaran [T.V. Vatheeswaran v. State of T.N., (1983) 2 SCC 68 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 342] and the cases which follow it. It is in this light, the Indian cases, particularly, the leading case of Triveniben [Triveniben v. State of Gujarat, (1989) 1 SCC 678 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 248] has been followed in the Commonwealth countries. It is useful to refer the following foreign s which followed the proposition: (i) Pratt v. Attorney General for Jamaica [(1994) 2 AC 1 : (1993) 3 WLR 995 : (1993) 4 All ER 769 (PC)], (ii) Catholic Commission for Justice & Peace in Zimbabwe v. Attorney General [(1993) 4 SA 239 (Zimbabwe SC)] , (iii) Soering v. United Kingdom [ Application No. 14038 of 1988 : (1989) 11 EHRR 439], (iv) Attorney General v. Susan Kigula [Constitutional Appeal No. 3 of 2006, decided on 21-1-2009 (Uganda SC)], (v) Herman Mejia v. Attorney General [ AD 2006 Action No. 296, decided on 11-6-2001 (Belize SC)]. 47. It is clear that after the completion of the judicial process, if the convict files a mercy petition to the Governor/ President, it is incumbent on the authorities to dispose of the same expeditiously. Though no time-limit can be fixed for the Governor and the President, it is the duty of the executive to expedite the matter at every stage viz. calling for the records, s and documents filed in the court, preparation of the note for approval of the Minister concerned, and the ultimate decision of the constitutional authorities. This Court, in Triveniben [Triveniben v. State of Gujarat (1989) 1 SCC 678 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 248], further held that in doing so, if it is established that there was prolonged delay in the execution of death sentence, it is an important and relevant consideration for determining whether the sentence should be allowed to be executed or not.
