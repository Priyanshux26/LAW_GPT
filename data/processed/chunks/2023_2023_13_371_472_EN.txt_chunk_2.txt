[Paras 19 and 21] Tax / Taxation – Classifi cation of expenditure or receipts – Diffi culty of relying on a single precedent for purpose of classifi cation – Precedent. Held: The propositions made in earlier cases, if sought to be applied to a diff erent case which the authors of those propositions did not have in mind, could lead to absurd results. It is trite that the words in a must not be construed in the same manner as those in a legislation. Hence, it is neither wise nor suitable to extend the dictum of one case, premised on the facts of the said case, to another fact-situation which is seemingly similar but not really so. This is particularly so when there is no precedent which has been rendered in an identical fact situation, as is the case in the instant matters. [Para 23] Tax / Taxation: Capital assets – Depreciation and Amortisation – One of the exceptions to depreciation of capital assets is amortisation – Income Tax Act, 1961 – ss.35A, 35AB, 35ABA and 35ABB.
