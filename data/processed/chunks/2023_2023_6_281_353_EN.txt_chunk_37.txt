Further, the quantity of medicament F used in a particular product will also not be a relevant factor for, normally, the extent of use of medicinal ingredients is very low because a larger use may be harmful for the human body. [Puma Ayurvedic Herbal (P) Ltd. v. CCE [(2006) 3 SCC 266], State of Goa v. Colfax Laboratories Ltd. [(2004) 9 SCC 83] and B.P.L. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. CCE [1995 Supp (3) SCC 1].] G 35. However, there cannot be a static parameter for the correct classification of a commodity. This Court in Indian Aluminium Cables Ltd. v. Union of India: (1985) 3 SCC 284 has culled out this principle in the following words: (SCC p. 291, para 13) H 332 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A “13. To sum up the true position, the process of manufacture of a product and the end use to which it is put, cannot necessarily be determinative of the classification of that product under a fiscal schedule like the Central Excise Tariff. What is more important is whether the broad description of the article fits in with the expression used in the Tariff.” B 36. Moreover, the functional utility and predominant or primary usage of the commodity which is being classified must be taken into account, apart from the understanding in common parlance. [See O.K. Play (India) Ltd. v. CCE [(2005) 2 SCC 460] , Alpine C Industries v. CCE [(2003) 3 SCC 111] , Sujanil Chemo Industries v. CCE & Customs [(2005) 4 SCC 189] , ICPA Health Products (P) Ltd. v. CCE [(2004) 4 SCC 481] , Puma Ayurvedic Herbal [(2006) 3 SCC 266] , Ishaan Research Lab (P) Ltd. [(2008) 13 SCC 349] and CCE v. Uni Products India D Ltd. [(2009) 9 SCC 295] ] *** *** *** 39. In our view, as we have already stated, the combined factors that require to be taken note of for the purpose of the classification of the goods are the composition, the product literature, the label, E the character of the product and the user to which the product is put. However, the miniscule quantity of the prophylactic ingredient is not a relevant factor. In the instant case, it is not in dispute that this is used by the surgeons for the purpose of cleaning or degerming their hands and scrubbing the surface of the skin of the patient before that portion is F operated upon. The purpose is to prevent the infection or disease. Therefore, the product in question can be safely classified as a “medicament” which would fall under Chapter Sub-Heading 3003 which is a specific entry and not under Chapter Sub-Heading 3402.90 which is a residuary entry.” G (emphasis supplied) 15.4. In Sunny Industries (supra), this Court was dealing with the question whether ‘Ad-Vitamin Massage Oil Forte’ was still classifiable as patent and proprietary medicine even after the change of tariff description after 1985 Budget. This Court dismissed the appeal of the H COMMISSSIONER OF CUSTOMS, CENTRAL EXCISE AND SERVICE TAX, 333 HYDERABAD v. ASHWANI HOMEO PHARMACY [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.]
