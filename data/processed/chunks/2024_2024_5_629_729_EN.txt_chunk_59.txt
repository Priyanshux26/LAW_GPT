It has been brought to our notice that the disciplinary proceedings initiated were dropped on the administrative side. However, an application in I.A. No. 29814 of 2023 has been filed by the learned Judge inter alia alleging that certain administrative work has been taken away from him, apparently on the basis of the impugned s, and therefore, he should either be restored with the said power or transferred to some other place. 52. Insofar as the Criminal Appeal No. 3925 of 2023 is concerned, there is no appeal filed on behalf of the victim. Therefore, the only question for consideration is as to whether the observation made against the appellant, is justified or not, especially when he has not been heard. On facts, even in this case, the trial had commenced and concluded in a single day. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 727 Sunita Devi v. The State of Bihar & Anr. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT Criminal Appeal No. 3924 of 2023 and Criminal Appeal Nos. 3926-3927 of 2023. 53. Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for both the informant and the learned Trial Judge, submitted that the procedure established by law has been followed. The appellant has kept in mind the rigour of Section 309 of the CrPC, 1973 read with the provisions contained under the POCSO Act, 2012. Even assuming that there is a procedural flaw, in view of the mandate contained under Section 465 of the CrPC, 1973 there is no need for remittal. During the course of trial, the counsel for the respondent-accused has not raised any serious objection. Criminal Appeal No. 3925 of 2023 It is further submitted that the appellant has discharged his judicial function and, therefore, any action without hearing him is contrary to law. Though the charges have been dropped, the observations made would be detrimental to his future career progression. The accused had antecedents and, therefore, the Trial Court rightly exercised due caution. It is a case where no witness was produced on behalf of the defence. To buttress his submission, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant has relied upon the following decisions, ● Munna Pandey v. State of Bihar, AIR 2023 SUPREME COURT 5709. ● Akil v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2013) 7 SCC 125. ● Sakshi v. Union of India, (2004) 5 SCC 518. ● State of Maharashtra v. Mahesh Kariman Tirki, (2022) 10 SCC 207. ● Pradeep S. Wodeyar v. State of Karnataka, (2021) 19 SCC 62. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 54. Per contra, Mr. C. U. Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for the High Court and the accused submitted that admittedly there are serious procedural violations. Prejudice was sufficiently demonstrated before the court. It would be impossible for a Judge to deliver the within such a short span of time. No opportunity was given at every stage of the trial to the accused. It is a clear case of “justice 728 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports hurried is justice buried”. There is no question of giving an opportunity to the appellant, the judicial officer, as no action is pending against him.
