This is refl ected by successive advertisements for the posts. In that scenario, to meet the exigency, if an exercise to constitute an equivalence committee was undertaken pursuant to a judicial of the Tribunal dated 30.06.2017, which was not 830 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. assailed by any of the writ petitioners, departure, if any, from the 2014 Rules cannot be faulted. Otherwise also, where rules are ambiguous, and it may take time to amend the rules, relaxation and clarifications are permissible as part of administrative exigency. (iv) There is nothing on record to infer that action of the State Government / HPSSC was actuated by extraneous consideration(s) or lack of bona fi de(s). (v) The petitioners could not substantiate that anyone or more of the selected persons obtained the requisite qualifi cations after the cut-off date. Impugned Decision of the High Court 9. In light of the fi ndings / observations noticed above, the High Court dismissed Writ Petition No. 34 of 2019 which questioned the relaxation ; and upheld the process of selection and appointment against Post Code 447. Consequent to the dismissal of Writ Petition No. 34 of 2019, other writ petitions, namely, numbered 2253, 2289, 2290, 2388, 2394 and 7681 of 2020, which were fi led for consideration of candidates who benefi ted from the relaxation , were dismissed as infructuous. 10. Writ petitions seeking relaxation in the eligibility conditions for the second advertisement (i.e., for Post Code 556) in terms provided for Post Code 447, were disposed of by directing that same relaxation be accorded for Post Code 556 as accorded for Post Code 447. In consequence, the High Court, in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the impugned , directed: “33. Thus, the HPSSC is directed to re-cast the merit list for JOA 556 by including all categories of candidate as was done for JOA 447 on the basis of decision of Government dated 21.8.2017/ 18.9.2017 and further made applicable to JOA 556 vide communication 19.3.2018 except the candidates with higher qualifi cation, who have already been held ineligible vide dated 29.8.2019 of a Division Bench of this Court in CWP 161/2019. These selections for JOA 556 shall be made by taking into account the entire number of vacancies advertised for JOA 556 and the decision of the Government/HPSSC to close the selection procedure for JOA 556 is set aside and quashed. ANKITA THAKUR & ORS. v. THE H.P. STAFF SELECTION 831 COMMISSION & ORS. [MANOJ MISRA, J.] 34. Since the Common R&P Rules stand amended by 2020 Rules and the cause of persistent confusion for the time being appears to have been removed, as a necessary consequence selection for JOA 817 shall take place in accordance with 2020 Rules, however, the selection process shall not include the selection for posts which were left over from advertised posts of JOA 556 as the said posts have already been directed to be fi lled through selection process of JOA 556.” 11. The resultant eff ect of the above directions would be that for recruitment against Post Code 556, candidates who, but for the relaxation dated 21.08.2017, were ineligible under the 2014 Rules, were to be treated eligible and the merit list redrawn accordingly.
