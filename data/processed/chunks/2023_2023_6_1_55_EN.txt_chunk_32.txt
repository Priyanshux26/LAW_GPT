The crucial fact in the said case is that the appellant therein filed an application on 01.02.2019 at 10.30 a.m. before the trial court and on the same day at 4.25 p.m., an additional complaint was filed against the appellant, on the basis of G which dismissal of the bail application was sought. This Court restored the of the trial court while setting aside the of the High Court, by holding that the accused is deemed to have “availed of” or enforced his right to be released on default bail, once application for bail has been filed under Section 167(2) on expiry of the stipulated time H 44 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A period. Taking into account the fact that before the expiry of 180 days, no charge-sheet had been submitted nor any application filed seeking extension of time to investigate, this Court held that the appellant was entitled to be released on statutory bail notwithstanding the subsequent filing of an additional complaint. The point that was decided in the said B case was that the filing of an additional complaint after the accused has availed his right to be released on default bail, should not deter the courts from enforcing this indefeasible right, if the charge-sheet was not filed before the expiry of the statutory period. Reference was made by this Court C to Madar Sheikh (supra) in M. Ravindran (supra). This Court observed that no prior application for bail was filed in Madar Sheikh (supra) though the charge-sheet was submitted after the expiry of the statutory period. This Court repeated the findings recorded in Madar Sheikh (supra) that the right to bail cannot be exercised once the charge-sheet has been D submitted and cognizance has been taken. As stated above, the said conclusion in Madar Sheikh (supra) was arrived at with reference to the facts of the case. 15. The issue that arose for consideration before this Court in Criminal Appeal Nos. 701-702 of 2020 relates to whether E the date of remand is to be included in computation of the period of 60 days or 90 days, as contemplated under proviso (a) to Section 167(2), for considering the claim for default bail. Taking note of the divergence of opinions on the said point, this Court felt the need for consideration of the issue F by a larger bench. The later dated 12.03.2021 passed in SLP (Crl.) Nos. 2105-2106 of 2021 and SLP (Crl.) Nos. 2111-2112 of 2021 is for tagging all those matters along with Criminal Appeal Nos. 701-702 of 2020. The submission made on behalf of the petitioners therein and recorded in the said relates to the filing of a charge-sheet on the last day G without a list of witnesses and documents not amounting to a proper filing of charge-sheet. Mr. Rohatgi referred to the SLP (Crl.) No. 2111-2112 of 2021 and submitted that one of the points raised relates to cognizance being taken before the expiry of the statutory period under Section 167, CrPC.
