No such procedure which divides labour on the basis of caste can be sustained. This prohibition shall also apply to labour done in prison industries and skill development programmes under paras 15.30 and 15.31, work done by undertrial prisoners under paras 24.43 and 24.44, work done by high-risk offenders under paras 25.19, work done by women prisoners under paras 26.106 to 26.109, and labour done by young offenders under paras 27.32 and 27.33. 207. Fourth, the counsel for the petitioner have argued that the Manual does not refer to the provisions of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, which prohibit manual scavenging. Clauses 2.10 and 6.79 deal with toilets.

Union of India & Ors. clarify that the Act has a binding effect even on prisons. In relation to toilets, manual scavenging273 or hazardous cleaning274 of a sewer or a septic tank inside a prison shall not be permitted. 208. Fifth, it has also been argued that caste-based privileges provided to certain prisoners are not forbidden, except in para 17.22. The said para states, “The main festivals of all religions should be celebrated. In these, every prisoner should be encouraged to participate. Any special treatment to a group of prisoners belonging to a particular caste or religion is strictly prohibited”. In addition, prison offences include “wilfully hurting other’s religious feelings, beliefs and faiths”275 and “agitating or acting on the basis of caste or religious prejudices”.276 We clarify that no special treatment shall be given to any group of persons or individuals on the basis of caste in any scenario. XVI. Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023 209. We now refer to the provisions of the “Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023”. The Ministry of Home Affairs, in consultation with various stakeholders, prepared this draft legislation and forwarded it to all States and Union Territories in May 2023 for adoption in their respective jurisdictions.277 The vision behind the preparation of the Model Act was to replace the previous colonial legislations, which have been “found to be outdated and obsolete”, with “a progressive and robust Act which is in tune with contemporary modern day needs and correctional ideology”.278 According to the Ministry, the Model Act is “a comprehensive document which covers all relevant aspects of prison management, viz. security, safety, scientific & technological interventions, segregation of prisoners, special provision for women inmates, taking appropriate action against criminal activities of prisoners in the prison, grant of parole and furlough to prisoners, 273 Sections 2(1)(g) and 5, The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 274 Ibid, Section 7 275 Para 21.09 (xxxvii), Model Prison Manual 2016 276 Ibid, Para 21.09 (xxxviii) 277 Unstarred Question No. 3007 (Lok Sabha, dated 8 August 2023), available at https://www.mha.gov.in/ MHA1/Par2017/pdfs/par2023-pdfs/LS-08082023/3007.pdf 278 Letter dated 10 May 2023 from Home Secretary, Government of India to Chief Secretaries, all States and UTs, available at https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/advisory_10112023.pdf 624 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
