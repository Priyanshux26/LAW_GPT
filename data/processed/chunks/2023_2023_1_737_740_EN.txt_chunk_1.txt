3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has vehemently submitted that as such the respondent No. 1 herein – original writ petitioner is the subsequent purchaser, who purchased the property G even after the Act, 2013 coming into force and therefore as observed and held by this Court in the case of Delhi Administration Thr. Secretary, Land and Building Department and Ors. Vs. Pawan Kumar and Ors., Civil Appeal No. 3646 of 2022 and Delhi Development Authority Vs. Godfrey Phillips (I) Ltd. & Ors., Civil H Appeal No. 3073 of 2022, being a subsequent purchaser, he had no DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANPREET SINGH & 739 ORS. [M. R. SHAH, J.] locus to challenge the acquisition / lapsing of the acquisition proceedings A under the Act, 2013. It is submitted that therefore, the High Court has materially erred in declaring that the acquisition with respect to the land in question is deemed to have lapsed in a writ petition filed by the respondent No. 1 being a subsequent purchaser, who as such had no locus to challenge the acquisition as observed and held by this Court in B the aforesaid decisions. 4. Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned senior counsel, however, has submitted that the decision of this Court in the case of Shiv Kumar & Anr. Vs. Union of India & Ors., (2019) 10 SCC 229, which has been considered by this Court while allowing Civil Appeal No. 3073 of 2022 - Delhi Development Authority Vs. C Godfrey Phillips (I) Ltd. & Ors. requires re-consideration as certain relevant aspects under the Act, 2013 has not been dealt with and/or considered. However, he is not disputing that the original writ petitioner is a subsequent purchaser, who acquired the right, title and interest in the property in the year 2018 and/or even subsequent to Act, 2013 coming D into force. 5. We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length. 6. At the outset, it is required to be noted that it was the specific case on behalf of the appellants before the High Court that the original E writ petitioner is a subsequent purchaser, who has acquired the right, title or interest in the land in the year 2018. The original writ petitioner was not the recorded owner at the time when the award with respect to the land in question under the provisions of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1894”) was issued. From the material on record, it appears that before the High Court, the original writ petitioner F claimed the right, title or interest on the basis of the Assignment Deed of 2015. In the present case, the notification under Section 4 of the Act, 1894 was issued on 25.11.1980 and the award was declared on 05.06.1987. Therefore, the short question, which is posed for the consideration of this Court is:- G Whether the original writ petitioner being a subsequent purchaser had locus to challenge the acquisition and/or lapsing of the acquisition?
