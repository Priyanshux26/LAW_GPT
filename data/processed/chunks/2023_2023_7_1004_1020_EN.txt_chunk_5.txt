It is submitted that the ITAT failed to appreciate that the assessee has taken contrary stands before the assessing authority and the Tribunal, on account of sale of development rights. It is submitted G that firstly, the assessee vide its letter dated 25.11.2011 submitted the Ledger Account in respect of development agreement. The perusal of the said Ledger Account revealed that the assessee claimed to have received income of Rs. 15,94,06,500/- from a development agreement on 31.03.2008 and the said entry was reversed on the same day by H COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX 8 MUMBAI v. GLOWSHINE 1011 BUILDERS & DEVELOPERS PVT. LTD. [M. R. SHAH, J.] passing a rectification entry on 31.03.2008 itself. Therefore, it was A reflected that the aforesaid payment was paid by the purchasing party on 31.03.2008 to an entity SICCL and all these entries were reflected on the same date. Based on the Ledger furnished by the assessee, pertinent questions were raised by the Assessing Officer which included reason of rectification and confirmation of the fact that the differential amount B of Rs 10,69,79,146/- was refunded to the purchaser. However, perusal of the passed by the ITAT reflects that the fact of receipt of money on 31.03.2008 was not even discussed. On the contrary, a reference was made to the MOU dated 27.12.2007 for a total consideration of Rs. 5,24,27,354/-. It is submitted that the ITAT without examining the true nature of transaction and entry made in the books of C accounts of the assessee simpliciter confirmed that the transactions pertained to earlier years i.e., Assessment Year 2008-09 and the reduction of amount arising out of the Development Agreement dated 06.05.2008 and Rectification dated 30.05.2008 was due to mistake. 4.1 It is further submitted by Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG, that D the ITAT failed to take into account the fact that the entry made and reflected in the Ledger Account of the assessee as on 31.03.2008 was on account of a third party i.e., SICCL and that too for a total of Rs. 15,94,06,500/-. Further, the ITAT did not even question the factum of refund of differential amount of Rs. 10,69,79,146/- to the purchaser on E account of Rectification Deed dated 30.05.2008. That the ITAT has failed to appreciate that the moment the receipt of amount is received and recorded in the books of accounts of the assessee, unless shown to be refunded/returned, is to be treated as income in the hands of the recipient. F 4.2 Secondly, balance sheets for the Assessment Years 2006-07 to 2009-10 were examined by the Assessing Officer and it was recorded that there was not even a single sale during all these years and there were negligible expenses and the transaction in question was the only transaction i.e., transfer of development rights in respect of land and consequently, it was held that the transaction was that of transfer of G capital asset and not that of transfer of stock in trade. However, the ITAT in its , after examining the opening and closing balance for the year 1996-97 upto 2007-08 held that in multiple years there was inventory shown in the Balance Sheet and since subsequent assessment s were made under Section 143(3) of the Income Tax Act, without H 1012 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R.
