[S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] mortgage have not been assigned by ICICI Bank Ltd. to the assignee bank, namely, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. Hence, it cannot be said that the impugned Deed of Assignment is unsustainable in law. The obligations referred to in the impugned Deed of Assignment are the obligations, if any, of ICICI Bank Ltd. towards Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. (assignee) in the matter of transfer of NPAs.” 39. The earlier discussion in this , about the true nature of the transaction in this case led this court to hold that it is an assignment and not a pledge. The reference to pledge, in some places in the documents, did not undermine the fact that the rents payable to and receivable by the lender (IL&FS) stood absolutely assigned to HDFC. The provisions of the TPA and the discussion of the various authorities support the conclusion that there can be a transfer of debts, which are defi ned as actionable claims. In the present case, the rents payable by IL&FS tenants, lessees and licensees are debts, which stood transferred to the creditor, i.e. HDFC Bank. Therefore, the NCLAT’s conclusions are unexceptionable; the challenge to its correctness, therefore fails. 40. For the foregoing reasons, this court holds that there is no merit in the appeal. It is accordingly dismissed, there shall be no on costs. Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal dismissed. Nidhi Jain
