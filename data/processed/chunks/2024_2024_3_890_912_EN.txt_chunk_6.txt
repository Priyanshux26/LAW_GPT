The interest amount was directed to be worked out and communicated to the appellant by the Assistant Commissioner, Central Excise Division, Pithampur. (vii) penalty of Rs.1,00,000.00 (Rupees one lakh only) was imposed on the appellant under Section 112 of the Customs Act. 20. It was against this that the related appeal was filed by the appellant before the CESTAT. By the impugned dated 30.04.2009, CESTAT dismissed the appeal. 21. Hence the present appeal. This Court by dated 21.08.2009 had issued notice. 22. Respondent has filed counter affidavit. It is stated that during the visit of the officials of the Preventive Branch of the Commissionerate on 07.08.1992, the impugned goods were found outside the notified warehouse. That apart, there was no explanation for the imported goods contained in the 27 cases which were neither found within the bonded warehouse nor outside the bonded warehouse within the factory premises. In such circumstances, the respondent has justified the dated 28.04.2005 which was affirmed by the CESTAT vide dated 30.04.2009. 23. It may be mentioned that appellant has brought on record two additional documents. Appellant had sought for information from the Central Warehousing Corporation under the Right to Information Act, 2005 vide letter dated 22.09.2009 regarding payment of custom establishment charges by the Corporation. Appellant was informed by the Central Warehousing Corporation vide letter dated 18.12.2009 that the Corporation had deposited a sum of Rs.56,10.294.00 under the head of ‘Pithampur Warehousing (Bhanu Iron and Steel Company 900 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Limited along with wind up Warehouse) custom establishment charges’ for the financial year 1992-1993 to 2007-2008. 24. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that CESTAT had failed to consider the fact that it was on the basis of specific permission granted to the appellant by the proper officer that the impugned goods were found outside the warehouse but within the industrial/factory premises of the appellant. Therefore, in terms Section 64(d) of the Customs Act respondent could not have treated the said goods as having been removed from the warehouse. He submits that since the appellant had not cleared the warehoused goods, Section 64 of the Customs Act would come into play. Therefore, CESTAT was clearly in error in upholding the of the respondent applying Section 15(1)(b) of the Customs Act for determining the rate of duty in respect of those goods. According to him, in the facts of the present case the only provision that would be applicable is the residuary provision i.e., Section 15 (1) (c) of the Customs Act. 24.1 Learned counsel has also placed reliance on the circular dated 12.07.1989 of the Central Board of Excise and Customs which was fully applicable to the case of the appellant. Though this circular was subsequently superseded by circular dated 14.08.1997, it would be the former circular which would be applicable to the facts of the present case. 24.2 Learned counsel further submits that CESTAT was not justified for upholding the of the respondent applying Section 71 of the Customs Act read with Section 28AB of the said Act while imposing interest on the confiscated goods.
