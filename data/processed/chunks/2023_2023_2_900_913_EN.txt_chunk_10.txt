But, in the present case, the very factum of Proviso to Rule 2 of the 1984 Rules being inserted in the rule has to be assigned a meaning, as otherwise, it would imply that the Proviso has become otiose. It cannot be said that the Proviso is not to be read in the context of the aspect of promotion. D 30. We also find that Rules 3B and 6 of the 1988 Rules also leave no ambiguity in this behalf and in fact read in consonance and the period of probation has to be necessarily excluded from period of service. As already stated, the grant of monetary benefit is a different aspect. E 31. On having come to the conclusion that the Government resolutions cannot override statutory rules, and the resolutions neither speaking about promotion to the post of DFO nor about seniority conclusively, the Proviso would operate with full force. 32. We are thus of the clear view that the applicable Rules leave no ambiguity in the matter and must prevail. F 33. The result of the aforesaid is that the appeal is dismissed leaving the parties to bear their own costs. Divya Pandey Appeal dismissed. G (Assisted by : Roopanshi Virang, LCRA) 8 (supra). 9 (supra). H
