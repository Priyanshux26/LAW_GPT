While the 1894 Act does not provide a strict definition of the term ‘market-value’, it essentially refers to the price that the asset would likely fetch in an open market transaction. Incontrovertibly, the Legislature has consciously chosen not to define this term, as is discernible from the reports of the Select Committee, wherein they posited that “no attempt would be made to define strictly the term in the Act and that the price which a willing vendor might be expected to obtain in the market from a willing purchaser, should be left for the decision primarily of the Collector and ultimately of the Court.”2 2 Commentary on the Land Acquisition Act, Om Prakash Aggarwal, 8th Edn.

Digital Supreme Court Reports Hence, during the framing of the 1894 Act, it was understood that the ‘market value’ would simply be the price which a willing buyer would give to a willing seller. 24. Given the statutory intention behind term ‘market value’, the natural corollary is that the sale exemplars reflecting the prices paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller would be the most relevant piece of evidence for determination of such value.3 25. However, for utilizing these sale deeds as the foundation for determining compensation, it is imperative that these sale instances satisfy certain criteria of comparability. In this regard, it is necessary that the sale deeds adhere to the following factors: i. the sale must be a genuine transaction; ii. the sale deed must have been executed at the time proximate to the date of the notification issued under Section 4 of the 1894 Act; iii. the land covered by the sale must be in the vicinity of the acquired land; and iv. the nature of such land, including its size, must be similar to the acquired land.4 26. Adverting to the facts of the case in hand, it is germane to our analysis to note that the landowners have placed their reliance on only one sale deed dated 22.02.1989, which values the land at INR 446 per sq. yd. Although this sale deed pertains to the land situated within the same village, its plot size is significantly smaller—being only 470 sq. yds.—as compared to the vast area under acquisition, which spans approximately 492 acres or 23.81 lakh sq. yds. There is no gainsaying that the prices of small plots of land cannot ordinarily serve as the basis of evaluating the market value of larger tracts of land.5 However, there is no legal impediment against considering sale exemplars of smaller parcels of land, provided they are subjected 3 Administrator General of W.B. v.
