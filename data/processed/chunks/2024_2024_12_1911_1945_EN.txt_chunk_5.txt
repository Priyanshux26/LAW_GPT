n. The Trial Court having regard to the pleadings of the parties framed the following issues for its consideration: “1) Whether there is any cause of action for the suit? 2) Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form? 3) Whether the suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties? 4) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for partition of suit land as per provisions of ALRR 1886? 5) Whether the TS 67/79 was decreed in favour of the plaintiff? 6) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree as prayed for? 7) To what other relief/reliefs the parties are entitled?” o. The Civil Judge (Jr. Div.) No. 1 Nagaon, Assam vide its and dated 16.07.2011 dismissed the Title Suit No. 83/2004 instituted by the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff was not entitled to seek imperfect partition in view of the bar encoded in Section 154(1)(e) of the Regulation, 1886. 1920 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports p. The Trial Court while answering the issues nos. 5, 6 and 7 respectively observed as under: “Issue No 5: 26.This issue was framed to decide whether TS 67/79 was decreed in favour of the plaintiff. This is a matter of records and there is nothing to prove or disprove this fact. The Ld. Counsel of the parties have not made any submissions in this regard. It appears from the record that initially TS 67/79 was decreed in favour of the plaintiff. Then it went to the first appellate court. The case was again remanded back by the appellate court. In the subsequent occasion the suit was dismissed on the ground that the suit is bad for non-joinder of parties and that no proper identification of the land could be established by the plaintiff and hence no effective decree could be passed. This issue is decided negatively. Issue No 6 & 7: 27. This suit is basically for partition of the suit land and for issuance of precept. From the discussions made in issue No 4 it transpires that the plaintiff has failed to prove his entitlement for partition. As such these two issues are decided against the plaintiff.” q. In such circumstances referred to above, the plaintiff preferred Title Appeal No. 30 of 2011 before the Civil Judge, Nagaon which came to be allowed vide and dated 16.05.2014, holding that as in the first round of litigation declaration of joint possession had already been issued (vide dated 20.04.1993 referred to above), plaintiff was entitled to recovery of exclusive Khas possession of his share of 01 kathas and 05 lechas by partition thereof. Furthermore, a direction was issued to the Trial Court to issue precept to the revenue authority to effect the partition. The operative part of the passed by the First Appellate Court reads thus:- “Appeal is allowed on contest. No cost. and decree passed by the learned Munsif No.2, [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1921 Abdul Rejak Laskar v. Mafizur Rahman & Ors. Nagaon in TS 83/04 dated 16-07-2011 is set aside.
