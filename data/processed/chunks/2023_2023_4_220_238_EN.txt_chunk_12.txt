Even assuming that the death has taken place, a day earlier i.e. 09.05.2000, still there is a long gap between the last seen which is at 7:00 pm on 08.05.2000 and the morning of 09.05.2000. In the case of State of Goa v. Sanjay Thakran10, where in the evidence of last seen, the recovery of dead body was only a few F hours before “last seen”, it was not considered reliable. The same was again emphasized by this Court in Ajit Singh v. State of Maharashtra11where it was emphasized that the time between victim last seen alive and the discovery of the body of the deceased has to be of close proximity, so that any other person being the author of the G crime cannot be ruled out. In this case,even if we take the time between the last seen and the approximate time of death as per the post-mortem, 8 (2007) 13 SCC 399 – para 23 9 (2016) 1 SCC 550 10 (2007) 3 SCC 755 H 11 (2011) 14 SCC 401 DINESH KUMAR v. THE STATE OF HARYANA 235 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] which would go beyond 48 hours preceding the time of post-mortem and A the time of death can be stretched to the morning of May 9, 2000, which still begs an explanation from the prosecution as to the time gap, as the deceased was last seen with the two accused on 08.05.2000 at 7:00 P.M. The trial court as well as the High Court have lost sight of the B vital aspect of the matter. Both the Courts have relied on Section 106 of the Act and have held that since the accused was last seen with the deceased and he has not been able to give any reasonable explanation of his presence with the deceased in his statement under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C., it has to be read against the accused and therefore it has to C be counted as an additional link in the chain of circumstantial evidence. In present case in the findings of the trial court and High Court this appears to be the most important aspect which weighed with the trial court as well as the High Court in establishing the guilt of the accused. We are, however, afraid this is a complete misreading of Section 106 of the Act. D Section 101 of the Act places the burden of proof on the prosecution. It reads as under :- 101. Burden of proof –– Whoever desires any Court to give as to any legal right or liability dependent on the E existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person. Section 106 of the Act creates an exception to Section 101 and reads as under :- F 106. Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge –– When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.
