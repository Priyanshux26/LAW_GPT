1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih shall be taken within a period of eight weeks and Respondent No. 1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih would be accordingly informed. It was made clear that the decision as to the grant will be on the basis of the law and the rules applicable at the time of consideration. 2.7. By the dated 09.07.2014 passed by the Joint Secretary, Commerce and Industries Department, West Bengal, the application fi led by the Respondent No. 1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih was rejected inter alia relying upon the earlier application fi led by WBMDTCL. Signifi cantly, this mentions that the two rejection s dated 13.03.2003 and 26.03.2003 were recalled by the Joint Secretary vide his dated 13.10.2006. This also refers to the factum that the Grant dated 07.04.1986 to WBMDTCL forIron Ore, Manganese and Fireclay in the plots in question had been revoked and the application for Long-Term Mining Lease fi led by WBMDTCL for Dolomite and Limestone was rejected by a common dated 24.09.2009. The dated 24.09.2009 has not been placed on record, though it is necessary to ascertain and know the reasons for cancellation and rejection in favour of WBMDTCL. WBMDTCL had applied earlier in point of time, and is a government of West Bengal undertaking. The dated 09.07.2014 does indicate that the cancellation and rejection against WBMDTCL had something to do with the Respondent No. 1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih, and possibly the dated 13.10.2006 in favour of the Respondent No. 1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih. This is refl ected from the reason given in the dated 09.07.2014, which states that since the recall dated 13.10.2006 was cancelled or revoked vide dated STATE OF WEST BENGAL v. M/S. CHIRANJILAL (MINERAL) 285 INDUSTRIES OF BAGANDIH [SANJIV KHANNA, J.] 03.12.2010, the rejection s dated 13.03.2003 and 26.03.2003 were still valid and the application for mining lease dated 07.08.1985 for Dolomite and Limestone by WBMDTCL still subsists. Thereupon, reference in the dated 09.07.2014 is made to sub-section (2) to Section 112 of the Mines 2 11.
