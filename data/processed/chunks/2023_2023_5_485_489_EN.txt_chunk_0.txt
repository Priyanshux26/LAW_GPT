The State of Andhra Pradesh has come up with the above appeal, challenging an of the Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra H 485 486 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A Pradesh issuing a writ of Habeas Corpus directing the Superintendent of the Central Prison, Kadapa to set at liberty, a convict by name P. Reddy Bhaskar (Convict No.5357). We have heard the learned Standing Counsel for the State of Andhra Pradesh and Mr. Seshadri Naidu, the learned senior counsel for B the respondent. The detenu was prosecuted in Sessions Case No.139/2006 for an offence under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short “IPC”) relating to a murder that took place on 27.05.2001. By a dated 19.12.2006, the detenu was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. C The conviction and punishment were confirmed by the High Court on appeal and the same has attained finality. It appears that the detenu escaped from custody twice during his incarceration, but was apprehended later. It is the case of the State that the detenu enjoyed self-attained freedom for about two years pursuant D to the first escape and for about three months pursuant to the second escape. It appears that immediately following the conviction for the offence under Section 302 IPC, the detenu was also convicted in another case in Case No.260/2006 for an offence of kidnapping under Section 365 IPC. E In this case, the detenu was convicted and imposed simple imprisonment for one year. By G.O.Ms. No.121 dated 14.08.2022, the Government of Andhra Pradesh granted special remission to 175 life convicts on the occasion of the Independence Day. Without giving him any opportunity for a third F escape, the Government set him at liberty under the said Government on 15.08.2022.
