However, in the present case, since the Section 11 application as well as the claims are time-barred, the remedy of pursuing arbitration cannot be available to the respondent in law. C. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 27. Mr. Jay Savla, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent submitted that the High Court rightly excluded the time taken by the respondent in pursuing the IBC proceedings, that is, the period between the date of filing of the Section 9 application before the NCLT and the date of the of this Court concluding the IBC proceedings by disposing of the appeal filed by the respondent against the of the NCLAT, while calculating the limitation period for the purpose of filing a fresh application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996. 28. He submitted that the aforesaid period is liable to be excluded under Section 14 of the Limitation Act as the respondent was pursuing the IBC proceedings diligently and in a bonafide manner. He relied on the following decisions of this Court to submit that the phrase “other cause of like nature” used in Section 14 of the Limitation Act should be given a wide and liberal interpretation: i. Consolidated Engg. Enterprises & Ors. v. Principal Secy. Irrigation Department & Ors. reported in (2008) 7 SCC 169 ii. J. Kumaradasan Nair v. Iric Sohan reported in 2009 (12) SCC 175 iii. Union of India v. West Coast Paper Mills Ltd. reported in 2004 (3) SCC 458 iv. Maharashtra State Farming Corporation Ltd. v. Belapur Sugar & Allied Industries Ltd. reported in 2004 (3) MHLF 414 29. He submitted that the second application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 was maintainable as the first application was withdrawn without any adjudication on merits and even before any formal notice could be issued by the High Court. By placing reliance on the decision of this Court in Sarva Shramik Sanghatana v. State of Maharashtra reported in 2008 1 SCC 494, he argued that the 156 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports withdrawal of an application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 is not the same as withdrawal of a suit or a claim, and thus the principles enshrined under 23 Rule 1 of the CPC will have no application to the present case. 30. It was submitted that Section 32 of the Act, 1996 provides for termination of arbitration proceedings and is the only provision that relates to termination of arbitration proceedings upon their commencement under Section 21. In the present case, arbitration was invoked by the respondent vide notice dated 09.07.2016, and there has been no termination of such arbitration proceedings as per Section 32 of the Act, 1996. Hence, in the absence of any express bar on filing of more than one 11(6) application under the provisions of the Act, 1996, the second 11(6) application filed by the respondent cannot be said to be not maintainable.
