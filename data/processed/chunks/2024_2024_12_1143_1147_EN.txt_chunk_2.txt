7. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the assessment of compensation by the High Court is already on higher side, however, still the insurance company, accepting the same, has not preferred any appeal. The of the High Court does not call for interference even with reference to claim regarding interest for the period between 22.06.2016 to 13.07.2023, during which the copy of the paper book was not supplied by the counsel for the appellants-claimants to the counsel for the insurance company. 8. Heard the learned counsels for the parties and perused the record available. 9. As far as assessment of compensation is concerned, in our view the same does not call for interference by this Court. The accident took place on 07.08.2006. The income of the deceased, claimed to be working as a driver, has been properly assessed at ₹8,750/- per month by the High Court. Under other heads also, appropriate amount of compensation has been awarded. Hence, award to that extent does not call for interference. 10. The appellants-claimants, for the period between 22.06.2016 to 13.07.2023, have been denied interest on the ground that there was delay on the part of the counsel for the appellants-claimants in not supplying the copy of the paper book to the counsel for the insurance company. Once the matter was before the Court, the appellants-claimants should not be deprived of the interest for the period between 22.06.2016 to 13.07.2023. It cannot be said to be the fault on the part of the appellants-claimants, comparable to a fault in filing the appeal beyond the period of limitation. In the case in hand, the appeal was barred by 708 days. The High Court while condoning the same, specifically directed that the appellants-claimants will not be entitled to any interest for the aforesaid period, in case the amount of compensation is enhanced. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1147 T.C. John @ Yohannan (Deceased) Through Lrs. v. V.J. Antony and Others The is quite reasonable. The aforesaid delay in filing the appeal was attributable to the appellants-claimants, hence, they will not be entitled to the interest for the period of 708 days. 11. At the same time, after having filed the appeal and during the pendency, the appellants-claimants should not be made to suffer directing for non-payment of interest, because for such default claimants alone could not be held responsible. Consequently, denial of interest to the appellants for the period between 22.06.2016 to 13.07.2023 as directed is not justified. 12. For the reasons mentioned above, the present appeal is partly allowed. The impugned passed by the High Court is modified to the extent that the appellants-claimants shall be entitled to compensation as directed and interest at the same rate for the period between 22.06.2016 to 13.07.2023. 13. Accordingly, the appeal is partly allowed with no as to costs. Result of the case: Appeal partly allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
