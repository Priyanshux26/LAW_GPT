He submitted that the appellant did not take any action to obtain the LOI anytime between 2003-2011. 16.3. While adjudicating on the delay in implementation of the project during 2003-2011, the AGRC relied on clause 11 of the development agreement dated 20.08.2003 requiring the appellant to complete the development of the project within three years from the issuance of the Commencement Certificate dated 14.07.2014. 15 Hereinafter, referred to as the “HPC”. 1460 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 16.4. On the issue of delay from 2003 to 2011, the High Court examined the facts independently and upheld the findings of the AGRC. The High Court held that a delay cannot be viewed as reasonable. Further, the High Court held that the litigation with Omkareshwar did not prevent the appellant from starting the project, especially when the appellant had the consent of more than 70% of the slum dwellers at all material times. The High Court also observed that the appellant was not diligent in procuring the LOI. 17. (ii) The second phase relates to the delay in obtaining necessary permissions, approvals and environmental clearances from 2011 to 2014. The SRA issued Annexure-III, certifying the financial capability of a developer on 21.06.2011 and this was followed by issuance of LOI dated 29.06.2011. The appellant applied for Environmental Clearance16 on 15.12.2011 and obtained it only on 28.04.2014. The Commencement Certificate for the construction of the rehabilitation building and the high-rise clearance by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai were issued to the appellant on 14.07.2014 and 09.10.2014, respectively. 17.1. In the above referred background, Mr. Sibal submitted that the EC had to be obtained before the Commencement Certificate could be issued for the construction of the rehabilitation building. For on-site construction of more than 20,000 square meters, EC is required and for this, he relied on condition no. 51 of the LOI dated 29.06.2011 and condition no. 38 of the intimation of approval dated 21.04.2012. While the appellant made an application for EC in the year 2011, it was granted only on 28.04.2014. He has submitted that the delay between 2011-2014 was again unavoidable as certain mandatory permissions were required. Per contra, Mr. Ahmadi submitted that an EC was not required to commence construction of the rehabilitation building as the on-site construction did not exceed 20,000 square meters. 17.2. Upon perusing the record, the AGRC found that the delay was indeed attributable to the appellant. The High Court also noticed that the appellant did not commence the construction after 16 Hereinafter, referred to as “EC”. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1461 Yash Developers v. Harihar Krupa Co-Operative Housing Society Limited & Ors. getting the necessary approvals but waited for the EC. The High Court also noted that some parts of the project like the rehabilitation building did not require an EC for commencing construction. 18. (iii) The third phase of delay relates to the alleged non-cooperation of certain slum dwellers leading to the stalling of the project from 2014 to 2019. Mr. Sibal submitted that as some of the slum dwellers were not cooperative, applications under Sections 33 and 38 of the Act for eviction were made to the Assistant Municipal Commissioner, MCGM.
