3.9. Respondent No.3 then moved an application dated 01.08.2019 before the Secretary, Department of Home Affairs, State of Maharashtra, seeking premature release under Sections 432 and 433A of the CrPC. Respondent No.3 specifically relied on the dated 17.07.2019 of the Gujarat High Court granting liberty to the convict to approach the State of Maharashtra seeking premature release. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 767 Bilkis Yakub Rasool v. Union of India & Others 3.10. As the case was investigated and prosecuted by the CBI, the opinion of the said Agency was sought on the application for premature release. The CBI submitted its report dated 14.08.2019 wherein it was recommended that respondent No.3 should serve his sentence fully and no leniency should be given to him. The CBI submitted that respondent No.3 had actively participated in the heinous crime and that the offences committed by him and others were serious in nature and thus, he should not be pardoned or the sentence, suspended or remitted. 3.11. Further, on 03.01.2020, the Special CBI Court, Mumbai, also gave a negative report and objected to the prayer for premature release of respondent No.3 on the ground of seriousness of the offence. It was observed that the offences committed by the accused fell into category 5 (b) of the relevant State policy and were extremely serious, thus, it would be improper to grant remission to respondent No.3. 3.12. Similarly, on 03.02.2020, the Superintendent of Police, Dahod, in his report submitted to the Collector and District Magistrate, Dahod, gave a negative opinion against the pre-mature release of respondent No.3 on the ground that the victim and her family members apprehended serious crimes against them if respondent No.3 was released prematurely. The Office of the Collector and District Magistrate, Dahod, on 19.02.2020 also opined against the pre-mature release of respondent No.3 by relying on the opinion dated 03.02.2020 of the Superintendent of Police, Dahod. 3.13. Respondent No.3 again approached the High Court of Gujarat by way of Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 1 of 2019 in Criminal Application No.4573 of 2019 seeking remission under Section 432 read with Section 433 of the CrPC. The High Court vide dated 13.03.2020 rejected the application preferred by respondent No.3 with a specific observation that the appropriate government under Section 432(7)(b) to exercise the powers of remission would be the State of Maharashtra and not the State of Gujarat. It was further recorded in the said that the counsel for respondent No.3 had sought the permission of the Court to move the High Court of Bombay for the same relief and therefore the application was disposed of with liberty to 768 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the writ petitioner therein in the aforesaid terms. It is pertinent to note that this still holds the field as it has neither been challenged nor recalled or set aside in accordance with law. 3.14.
