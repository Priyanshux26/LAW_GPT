The petitioner herein feeling aggrieved with the passed by the SCDRC challenged the same before the NCDRC by filing the First Appeal No. 376 of 2016 under Section 19 of the Act 1986.The petitioner prayed before the NCDRC to set aside the SCDRC’s in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction and grant costs against the complainant in favour of the petitioner.

In such circumstances referred to above, the petitioner is here before this Court with the present petition, seeking special leave to appeal C under Article 136 of the Constitution. DISCUSSION 12. In the course of the hearing of this matter, manyfold contentions were raised on either side. However, the moot question that falls for our consideration is whether we should entertain this petition seeking special D leave to appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution directly against the passed by the NCDRC in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction or relegate the petitioner to avail the remedy of filing a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution or a petition invoking supervisory jurisdiction of the jurisdictional High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution?
