Article 31 guaranteed the right to private property, which could not be deprived without due process of law and upon just and fair compensation. 18 The right to property ceased to be a fundamental right by the Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, however, it continued to be a human right in a welfare State, and a constitutional right under Article 300-A of the Constitution. Article 300-A provides that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. The State cannot dispossess a citizen of his property except in accordance with the procedure established by law. The obligation to pay compensation, though not expressly included in Article 300-A, can be inferred in that Article. [See: K.T. Plantation (P) Ltd. v. State of Karnataka, (2011) 9 SCC 1] 19 In Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v. Darius Shapur Chenai reported in (2005) 7 SCC 627, this Court held that: 720 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “6. … Having regard to the provisions contained in Article 300-A of the Constitution, the State in exercise of its power of “eminent domain” may interfere with the right of property of a person by acquiring the same but the same must be for a public purpose and reasonable compensation therefor must be paid.” (Emphasis supplied) 20 In N. Padmamma v. S. Ramakrishna Reddy reported in (2008) 15 SCC 517, this Court held that: “21.If the right of property is a human right as also a constitutional right, the same cannot be taken away except in accordance with law.

The provisions of the Act seeking to divest such right, keeping in view of the provisions of Article 300-A of the Constitution of India, must be strictly construed.” (Emphasis supplied) 21 In Delhi Airtech Services (P) Ltd. v. State of U.P. reported in (2011) 9 SCC 354, this Court recognised the right to property as a basic human right in the following words: “30. It is accepted in every jurisprudence and by different political thinkers that some amount of property right is an indispensable safeguard against tyranny and economic oppression of the Government. Jefferson was of the view that liberty cannot long subsist without the support of property. “Property must be secured, else liberty cannot subsist” was the opinion of John Adams. Indeed the view that property itself is the seed-bed which must be conserved if other constitutional values are to flourish, is the consensus among political thinkers and jurists.” (Emphasis supplied) 22 In Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar v. State of Gujarat reported in 1995 Supp (1) SCC 596, this Court held as follows: “48. … In other words, Article 300-A only limits the powers of the State that no person shall be deprived of [2024] 6 S.C.R. 721 Dharnidhar Mishra (D) and Another v. State of Bihar and Others his property save by authority of law. There has to be no deprivation without any sanction of law. Deprivation by any other mode is not acquisition or taking possession under Article 300-A.
