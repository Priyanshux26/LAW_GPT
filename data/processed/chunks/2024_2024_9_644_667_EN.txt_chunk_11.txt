However, such umbrella of protection is removed upon the conclusion of the fifth year from the date of death of the original tenant, in case the original tenant died after the 1997 Act came into effect. For the similar heirs of the original tenants who had died prior to the 1997 Act coming into force, a period of five years was counted from the date of the 1997 Act coming into operation. 24. It was a policy decision taken by the legislature to afford a five-year period for the dependents of the original tenant who ordinarily resided with him at the time of his death to make alternative arrangements. To ensure that all such heirs of the original tenant had the same time period [2024] 9 S.C.R. 659 Rajesh Mitra @ Rajesh Kumar Mitra & Anr. v. Karnani Properties Ltd. to make alternative arrangements, the clause “whichever is later” was introduced in Section 2(g) of the 1997 Act so that the heirs of the original tenant who had died prior to the 1997 Act coming into force did not have a shorter time to make such alternative arrangements. That is the meaning and purpose of the expression, “whichever is later”, in Section 2(g) of the Act.” Thus, the counsel for the respondent/landlord would argue that even if the appellants claim tenancy under the 1956 Act, then also their tenancy would expire on 09.07.2006, i.e., five years after the 1997 Act came into force. This logic is based on the interpretation of the term “whichever is later”. In other words, protection is only for five years, even for the one who had inherited ‘tenancy’ when the old Act was in force, as it say five years from the death of the tenant or five years from the enforcement of the Act, “whichever is later”. Since the new Act came into force in 2001, therefore, although the tenant (and in this case it would be the father of the appellant i.e., the original tenant) died in the year 1970 but five years will be counted from 2001. In other words, the language of the statute suggests that its purpose was to cover even the death of a tenant which occurred during the subsistence of the old Act. But such an interpretation would depend upon whether the new Act has a retrospective application! 10. Whether the 1997 Act would cover such tenants who were protected under the 1956 Act is the question? The High Court has held that the legislature by virtue of section 2(g) of the 1997 Act, intended to extinguish the tenancy of all such legal heirs, who inherited it on the death of their predecessor-in-interest before the enforcement of the 1997 Act. Such rights would expire after five years from the commencement of Act. To understand the intention of the legislature, we will have to examine the provisions of the 1956 Act and also the 1997 Act. 11. The West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 received assent from the President of India on 28.11.1998 and as per notification dated 09.07.2001, the provisions of the 1997 Act came into force on 10.07.2001.
