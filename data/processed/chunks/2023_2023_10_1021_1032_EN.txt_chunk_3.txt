On the same day, the Trial Judge recorded statement of the Public Prosecutor that he was not examining PW1’s father as being unnecessary F and he was dropping milkman as he was won over. Even the appellant’s father was a crucial witness. This is a case where an adverse inference will have to be drawn against the prosecution for non-examination of the milkman and the appellant’s father. There is another circumstance which is relevant as far as the appellant is concerned. According to the prosecution, there were G foot marks of the shoes/footwear of the accused near the house where the incident took place. The prosecution took the moulds of the foot marks, as deposed by PW-6. The footwear/shoes of both the accused were taken into custody in the presence of PW-6. But, the shoes of the present appellant did not match the moulds H of the imprint of the shoe taken by the prosecution. Apart from PRADEEP v. THE STATE OF HARYANA 1025 the non-examination of the milkman, PW-11 Investigation Officer, A did not make investigation by recording the statements of the elder brothers of PW1 for verifying whether they were away from the house on the date of the incident. After closely scrutinising the evidence of PW-1 and considering what we have already observed, the possibility of the witness being tutored cannot be B ruled out. There is no support or corroboration to the testimony of PW-1, apart from other deficiencies in the prosecution case, as pointed out above. In the facts of the case, it will not be safe to base the conviction only on the testimony of PW-1 which does not inspire confidence.
