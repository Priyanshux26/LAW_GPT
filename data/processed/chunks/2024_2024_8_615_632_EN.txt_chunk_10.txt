This provision has two parts. Under sub-section (a), the Arbitrator can award interest for the period between the date of cause of action to the date of the award, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Sub-section (b) provides that unless the award directs otherwise, the sum directed to be paid by an arbitral award shall carry interest at the rate of 2% higher than the current rate of interest, from the date of the award to the date of payment. IV. The wording of Section 31(7)(a) marks a departure from Arbitration Act, 1940 in two ways: first, it does not make an explicit distinction between pre-reference and pendente lite interest as both of them are provided for under this sub- section; second, it sanctifies party autonomy and restricts the power to grant pre-reference and pendente lite interest the moment the agreement bars payment of interest, even if it is not a specific bar against the Arbitrator.6 V. The power of the Arbitrator to award pre-reference and pendente lite interest is not restricted when the agreement 4 Board of Trustees for the Port of Calcutta v.

The State of West Bengal & Anr. is silent on whether interest can be awarded7 or does not contain a specific term that prohibits the same.8 VI. While pendente lite interest is a matter of procedural law, pre-reference interest is governed by substantive law.9 Therefore, the grant of pre-reference interest cannot be sourced solely in Section 31(7)(a) (which is a procedural law), but must be based on an agreement between the parties (express or implied), statutory provision (such as Section 3 of the Interest Act, 1978), or proof of mercantile usage.10 9.6 In view of the above, the High Court had no reason to interfere with the Arbitral Award with respect to grant of pre-reference interest, since the Contract between parties does not prohibit the same.
