They, however, chose to file SLP (C) No. 23514 of 2023 before this Court against the said dated 23.08.2023. As already noted hereinabove, Writ Appeal No. 2017 of 2023 was filed against the very same by the MPPSC before a Division Bench of the High Court and the said appeal is pending consideration. More importantly, the petitions filed therein by Vaishali Wadhwani and others, seeking the vacating of the stay of the dated 23.08.2023, were dismissed and that was not subjected to challenge by them. Having sought vacating of the stay passed in relation to the dated 23.08.2023, in effect, seeking implementation thereof, it is surprising that Vaishali Wadhwani and the others sought to challenge the very same before this Court. In any event, even if they have any grievance with the said , it is not open to them to bypass the remedy of appeal available to them before the High Court itself. We are, therefore, not inclined to entertain their special leave petition. 24. Similarly, Mamta Mishra, who was also a petitioner in Writ Petition No. 4783 of 2023 along with Vaishali Wadhwani, chose to file SLP (C) No. 27620 of 2023 assailing the dated 23.08.2023 passed therein. For reasons alike, as stated in the context of SLP (C) No. 23514 of 2023 filed by Vaishali Wadhwani and others, this special leave petition also does not merit consideration. [2024] 6 S.C.R. 49 Deependra Yadav and Others v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Others 25. I.A. No. 102595 of 2023 was filed by four candidates seeking to come on record in SLP (C) No. 5817 of 2023. They claimed to be similarly situated to Deependra Yadav, the first petitioner therein. IA No. 132609 of 2023 was filed by two of the 398 ousted candidates, seeking to be impleaded in SLP (C) No. 5817 of 2023. I.A. No. 228055 was filed by 182 candidates seeking to come on record in SLP (C) No. 5817 of 2023, so as to support the petitioners therein. They stated that they stood ousted after normalization and merger of the marks secured by candidates in the two main examinations. However, as grievances of candidates who appeared in the Madhya Pradesh State Service Examination-2019 are not personal or individual to them alone and we are concerned with resolving the larger issue, we do not consider it necessary to implead any of these individual candidates who were not parties before the High Court or give them a hearing. In any event, all the relevant issues and aspects have been comprehensively and conclusively addressed by the learned senior counsel/counsel appearing for the parties on record and nothing more remains to be added thereto. 26. Further, we had requested the two experts, who had guided the MPPSC in undertaking the process of normalization, to appear before us so as to explain the methodology adopted. Having heard the two experts, namely Dr. Vastashpati Shastri and Mr. Indresh Mangal, we are fully satisfied that a transparent process, which was completely above board, was adopted to bring all the candidates onto an even platform so as to finalize the list of candidates eligible to be interviewed.
