On these grounds, 1 [1990] Supp. 3 SCR 259 : 1992 Supp(1) SCC 335 2 [2006] Supp. 3 SCR 704 : (2006) 6 SCC 736 3 [2018] 13 SCR 1028 : (2019) 11 SCC 706 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 823 C. Subbiah @ Kadambur Jayaraj and Others v. The Superintendent of Police and Others learned counsel for the complainant and the learned Standing Counsel for the State implored the Court to dismiss the appeal. Consideration of submissions and material on record: - 25. Heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and perused the impugned as well as the complaint and the charge sheet filed against the accused appellants. 26. The arguments were heard, and the was reserved on 16th February, 2024. Thereafter, we thought it fit to seek a clarification from the learned counsel for the parties because on going through the material available on record, we were prima facie of the opinion that the case presents sufficient material to direct inquiry under the provisions of Section 13(1)(b) and Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988(hereinafter being referred to as ‘PC Act’) because, manifestly, the complainant being a public servant had indulged in large scale benami land transactions without disclosing the same to his employer. Accordingly, learned counsel for the complainant was put to notice and he has submitted a short clarificatory note mentioning therein that the complainant is an Income Tax assessee from the year 2000. It is also submitted in the note that the complainant started the business of real estate from the year 2004 onwards and had acquired significant wealth during the course of this business. The complainant was appointed as a teacher in the Government School only in the year 2007 when he was nearly 45 years of age. He has superannuated in the year 2022 without any pensionary benefits. Thus, it was submitted that whatever money the complainant invested in the disputed land deals entered into with the accused, were genuine investments made by using his valid and declared sources of income and savings. A chart was also set out along with this explanation regarding the sources from where the complainant received various amounts which he claims to have invested in the disputed land deals. 27. Being satisfied with the explanation so offered, we do not find any justifiable cause so as to direct an enquiry against the complainant for the offences under the PC Act. 28. Now, we proceed to appreciate the merits of the present appeal. 29. At the outset, we may note that the complainant has come out with a clear case that he was already involved in real estate business before being selected as a Government teacher in the year 2007. 824 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Hence, it can safely be assumed that he was well versed with the nitty gritties of such business and the innocence and ignorance feigned by him in the complaint qua pros and cons of fallouts of property dealings cannot ex facie be countenanced.
