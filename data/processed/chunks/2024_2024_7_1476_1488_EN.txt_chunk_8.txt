8. We, therefore, reject the argument addressed on behalf of the respondents that the High Court was entitled to pass any which it thought fit in the interest of justice. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned and allow the appeal, but in the circumstances without costs. 19. The upshot of the discussion is that the High Court had clearly fallen in error in invoking the power under Section 482, Cr.P.C., as also the power under Section 147, N.I. Act, to compound the offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act qua the respondent-accused. Hence, the impugned to the extent it compounded the offence under Section 138, N.I. Act invoking the inherent power under Section 482, Cr.P.C. and the power under Section 147, N.I. Act stands quashed and set aside. 20. However, the position is that the respondents have, by now, deposited an amount of Rs. 6,50,000/- along with 12% simple interest per annum from the date of cheque till the date of actual payment besides a sum of Rs. 1 lakh payable additionally, as ed under the impugned before the trial court. Therefore, the amount is available to be withdrawn by the appellant-complainant. 21. In view of the peculiar position thus obtained with respect to the deposit of the amount payable under the impugned , the fact that the dishonored cheque Nos.17632 dated 19.01.2020 and 17633 dated 09.02.2020 were respectively for Rs.3,00,000/- and Rs.3,50,000/- and the further fact that upon receiving the summons, the respondent-accused have expressed their readiness to effect the payment and to settle the matter, we are of the considered view that there is no point in restoring the proceedings and to permit their continuance before the trial Court, though we have set aside the impugned to the extent it compounded the offence under Section 138, of the N.I. Act, invoking the power under Section 482, Cr.P.C., and Section 147, N.I. Act. Hence, despite the lack of consent 1488 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports from the appellant-complainant, we found that it is a befitting case to invoke the power of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to do complete justice between the parties and to quash Complaint Case No.5564 of 2022 as also all proceedings emerging therefrom. Hence, Complaint Case No. 5564 of 2022, pending before the Court of MM (N.I. Act), Digital Court-02/SED, Saket District Courts and all the further proceedings therefrom stand set aside and quashed. The appellant-complainant will be entitled to withdraw, in accordance with law, entire amount in deposit before the trial Court viz., Rs.6,50,000/- along with 12% simple interest per annum from the date of the cheque in question till the date of actual payment along with the additionally paid Rs.1,00,000/-. We make it clear that observations, if any, made in this case are solely for the purpose of deciding the captioned appeals. 22. The appeals stand disposed of on the above terms. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeals disposed of.
