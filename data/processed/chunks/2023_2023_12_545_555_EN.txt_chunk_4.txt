9. We fi nd that the present appeals deserve to be allowed on more than one grounds. Insofar as the writ petition fi led by the landowners is concerned, apart from there being a delay of about 14 years in approaching the High Court, the said writ petition was also liable to be dismissed in view of the doctrine of election. 10. It has been consistently held by this court in a catena of s that if a party has more than one remedy and if he chooses one of them, he is estopped from taking recourse to the other remedy. Reference in this respect could be made to the s of this Court in the cases of A.P. State Financial Corporation v. GAR Re-rolling Mills and another2, R.N. Gosain v. Yashpal Dhir3, National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mastan and another4, State of Punjab and others v. Dhanjit Singh Sandhu5and recently in the case of Union of India and others v. N. Murugesan and others6. 11. The writ petition fi led by the landowners was also liable to be dismissed invoking the principle of approbate and reprobate, which has been succinctly considered by this Court in the case of N. Murugesan (supra) after considering the earlier case laws. 12. In the present case, in the Development Plan published on 15th December 1992, the properties of the landowners were reserved as “Green Zone”/ “No Development Zone”. Vide Notifi cation dated 18th August 2004, the same was converted from “No Development Zone” to “Residential Zone”. The said Notifi cation specifi cally provided that in addition to reserving 10% space as “open space”, which was required to be compulsorily reserved in accordance with the DCR, additional space of 10% was to be reserved for amenities to be transferred to the Municipal Council free of cost. 2 (1994) 2 SCC 647 3 (1992) 4 SCC 683 4 (2006) 2 SCC 641 5 (2014) 15 SCC 144 6 (2022) 2 SCC 25 552 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 13. On the basis of the same, the landowners sought permission from the Town Planning Authority for the development of the land, and the same was granted. 14. On the basis of these s, the landowners executed an agreement on 27th March 2006, thereby assigning to the Municipal Council an area of 4133.25 sq. mtrs. as ‘open space’, whereas an area of 4126.50 sq. mtrs. was assigned as an ‘amenity space’. The said agreement also provided for an area of 7560.09 sq. mtrs. as an ‘internal road’ area to the Municipal Council out of the total land. 15. On 12th January 2007, a fi nal sanction was granted to the layout by the Municipal Council. On 18th September 2007, another agreement was entered into between the parties. On the same date, the Municipal Council also sanctioned a layout showing the lands reserved for ‘internal road’, ‘open space’, and ‘amenity space’. The landowners acting on the basis of the said sanction plan converted the layout into 65 plots and sold the same to various plot holders.
