A non-obstante clause must be given effect to the extent Parliament intended and not beyond.96 In construing a provision containing a non obstante clause, courts must determine the purpose and object for which the provision was enacted.97 The courts are also required to find out the extent to which the legislature intended to give one provision overriding effect over another provision.98 In case of a clear inconsistency between two enactments, a provision containing a non obstante clause can be given an overriding effect over a provision contained in another statute. 93 State of Bihar v.

Another principle of interpretation is that when two laws are inconsistent or repugnant, the later legislation is interpreted as having impliedly repealed the earlier legislation. The principle underlying implied repeal is that there is no need for the later enactment to state in express words that the earlier enactment has been repealed if the legislative intent to supersede the earlier law is manifested through the provisions of the later enactment.99 In MCD v. Shiv Shankar,100 this Court culled out the following principles applicable to the implied repeal of legislation: a. A subsequent legislation may not be too readily presumed to effectuate a repeal of existing statutory laws in the absence of express or at least unambiguous indication to that effect; b. Courts must lean against implying a repeal unless the two provisions are so plainly repugnant to each other that they cannot stand together and it is not possible on any reasonable hypothesis to give effect to both at the same time; c. It is necessary to closely scrutinise and consider the true meaning and effect of both the earlier and the later statute; and d. If the objects of the two statutory provisions are different and the language of each statute is restricted to its objects or subject, then they are generally intended to rule in parallel lines without meeting and there would be no real conflict. 43. The principle on which the rule of implied repeal rests is that if the subject-matter of a later legislation is identical to that of an earlier legislation so that they both cannot stand together, then the earlier legislation is impliedly repealed by the later legislation.101 The courts have to determine whether the legislature intended the two sets of provisions to be applied simultaneously.102 The presumption against implied repeal is based on the theory that the legislature knows the existing laws and does not intend to create any confusion by retaining two conflicting provisions or statutes.103 The test to be applied for the 99 State of Orissa v.
