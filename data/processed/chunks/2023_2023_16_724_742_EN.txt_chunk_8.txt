Parties confi rm that the said Memorandum of Understanding is confi rmed by themselves in their personal capacity and also in their capacity as members of the Samiti. 9. Parties confi rm that decree be passed in terms of Consent Terms as against the Defendant Nos. 1 to 4 and 6 to 9 and 16 herein. 736 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 10. Parties confi rm that the suit may be continued as against other Defendant Nos.10 to 15 as they are not ready and willing to cooperate and sign the Consent Terms herein.” According to the appellants before this Court, the suit was decreed in terms of the MoU as against defendant nos.1 to 9, as to what happened for the remaining defendants, it is not clear as no such is there on record. 16. Meanwhile, after the aforesaid MoU/Settlement, the Developer wrote to the SRA on 05.10.2009 stating that the rehabilitation scheme which was earlier facing problems has been resolved. It says that earlier the slum dwellers were divided into diff erent groups and got themselves formed into diff erent societies who were creating obstructions in the construction, but now an amicable settlement has been arrived between the parties and the consent terms/MoU was fi led in Civil Suit No.1341 of 2007. The terms of the MoU are binding between the parties and the project would be now completed. It further requests that on the complaint of SRA, the earlier enquiry which was being conducted against the developer be dropped. It so happens that an enquiry against the Developer was pending. We are not aware as to the fate of this enquiry. Be that as it may, more or less similar information and request was made by the appellants before SRA vide its letter dated 28.10.2009. 17. Pursuant to the MoU/Settlement between the developer and the appellants, the appellants approached SRA to do the allotment as per the terms of settlement. There are some exchange of letters between the parties on which much reliance has been placed by the appellant to show that their request for allotment of Towers D, E and F was being agreed. This, however, is not correct, but even assuming there was any such indication and an assurance by SRA or any of its offi ce bearers in this regard, the same would be in violation of the law, as we shall explain in a while. 18. Ultimately the SRA decided vide dated 21.09.2020 to allot 712 fl ats on Tower D, E & F, on the basis of lottery, but then vide dated 25.09.2020, the SRA stayed this . This dated 25.09.2020 was challenged by the appellant before the Bombay High Court in a writ petition which was disposed of vide dated 09.10.2020 directing SRA to take a call on allotments of these fl ats in Tower D, E & F, by way of lottery. The SRA in compliance with the said passed an on 26.10.2020 SAYUNKTA SANGARSH SAMITI & ANR v. THE STATE OF 737 MAHARASHTRA [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.]
