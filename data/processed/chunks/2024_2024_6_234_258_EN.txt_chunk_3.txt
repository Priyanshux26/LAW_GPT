On 12.07.2013, appellants filed CWP No. 15983 of 2013 challenging the recovery notice. The relevant ground was raised in the following terms: “G. BECAUSE the Impugned s deserve to be quashed as the recovery which has been initiated by first sending the notice on 10.01.2012 under the provisions of Haryana Public Moneys (Recovery of Dues) Act, 1979 is much beyond the limitation to recover any dues by the Corporation. The period of limitation if any was 3 years from 31.07.2004, when the amount stood and payable by Respondent No. 3 Company (in Liqn.). The period to recovery from either the Company or the Guarantors who stood surety for the said amount expired in the year 2007. The recovery as per the notices sent by the Respondent Corporation admittedly have been sent on 10.01.2012 and subsequent thereto and therefore any adjudication or determination of a sum due in view of the above said Act is unsustainable and is in any case time barred” xiv.
