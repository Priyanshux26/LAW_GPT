Further, this circumstance by itself is not so clinching as to conclusively point towards the guilt of the appellant by ruling out possibility of a third-party hand in the murder. In this regard, it be noticed that, as per the prosecution case, the deceased was found injured at around 2000 hours in an open area at some distance from H STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH v. PHOOLCHAND RATHORE 623 [MANOJ MISRA, J.] the hut of the accused. At what time the accused had taken A the deceased on his bicycle is not clear from the testimony of PW4 though, from the first part of her testimony, it appears that the accused and the deceased were noticed quarrelling with each other at about 1630 hours and soon thereafter, the appellant took the deceased on his cycle. If, B from that, we put the event of taking the deceased on bicycle at about 1630 hours there is still quite a large time-gap between 1630 hours and 2000 hours for other intervening factors to operate. In light thereof, considering that the place of occurrence was an open place and the other circumstances (i.e. motive, disclosure, recovery and extra C judicial confession) were not proved beyond reasonable doubt, shifting the burden on the accused to explain the circumstances in which the deceased sustained injuries, or to demonstrate that he parted company of the deceased, would not be justified in the facts of the case. D 25. For all the reasons above, if the High Court has extended the benefit of doubt to the accused, its view being a plausible view, in our opinion, does not call for any interference. 26. The appeals are, therefore, dismissed. E Ankit Gyan Appeals dismissed. (Assisted by : Kavya Agarwal and Mayank Batra, LCRAs) F G H
