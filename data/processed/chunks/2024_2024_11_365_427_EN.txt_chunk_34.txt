73. The High Court erred in holding that a statute is bound to be struck down if it is violative of the basic structure. Invalidation of a statute on the grounds of violation of secularism has to be traced to express provisions of the Constitution. Further, the fact that the State legislature has established a Board to recognise and regulate is exactly in the spirit of these considerations that this Court in its advisory opinion in Kerala Education Bill case [1959 SCR 995 : AIR 1958 SC 956] recognised a fair degree of discrimination in favour of religious minorities. In this respect the Court seems to have acted on the same principle which is applied to socially and educationally backward classes, that is the principle of protective discrimination.”] 95 [2018] 11 SCR 765 : (2019) 3 SCC 39 96 Ravinder Kumar Dhariwal v.

Digital Supreme Court Reports Madarsa education is not violative of Article 14. The Madarsa Act furthers substantive equality. e. Interplay of Article 21-A and Article 30 74. Article 21-A provides that the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine. It imposes a constitutional obligation on the State to impart elementary and basic education. Parliament enacted the RTE Act to provide full-time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality to every child in pursuance of Article 21-A. The RTE Act seeks to provide a “quality education without any discrimination on economic, social, and cultural grounds.”100 Section 3 makes the right of children to free and compulsory education justiciable.101 75. In Society for Unaided Private Schools of Rajasthan v. Union of India,102 a three-Judge Bench of this Court upheld the constitutional validity of the RTE Act. It further held that the statute applies to an aided school including a minority school receiving aid or grant to meet whole or part of its expenses from the appropriate Government or local authority. Subsequently, Parliament amended the RTE Act to exempt its application to Madarsas, vedic pathsalas and educational institutions primarily imparting religious instruction.103 76. In Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust v. Union of India,104 a Constitution Bench had to determine the constitutional validity of Article 21-A. One of the issues before this Court was whether Article 21-A conflicts with Article 30. This Court held that the law enacted by Parliament under Article 21-A cannot abrogate the right of minorities to establish and administer schools of their choice. It held that application of the RTE Act to minority educational institutions, whether aided or unaided, “may destroy the minority character of 100 State of Tamil Nadu v.
