Supreme Court Reports had been in settled possession of the suit land since 1990, following execution of the Agreement to Sell – They produced documentary proof including the original sale deed, Rin Pustika, and land revenue receipts have paid land revenue, indicating de facto and de jure control – The defendants failed to rebut the evidence of possession and title handover – It also distinguished Thiruvengadam Pillai v. Navaneethammal, (2008) 4 SCC 530, cited to argue execution defects, as the plaintiffs were in possession, stamp duty and evidentiary support were both satisfied in present case: Held: Plaintiffs' continuous possession supported by documentary evidence established part performance – The Court found that possession pursuant to a lawful agreement, coupled with part payment and willingness to perform, attracted protection under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. [Paras 31–32, 34.1, 34.6-34.8] Readiness and Willingness – Full consideration paid – Continuous willingness – Delay attributable to defendants – The plaintiffs paid the full consideration under the Agreement to Sell at the outset and remained ready and willing to execute the formal sale deed – The delay was due to the inaction of defendants – The plaintiffs’ consistent conduct and attempts to seek mutation and performance were evident: Held: Plaintiffs complied with Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act. [Paras 20.4, 21.4] Lis Pendens – Section 52 TPA – Sale during pendency – Violation of injunction – Purchasers not bona fide – Doctrine to prevent frustration of judicial process – On 18.01.2001, while the suit for specific performance was pending and after an injunction was granted on 04.12.2000, the defendants executed four sale deeds in favour of third parties: Held: Sale deeds executed during pendency and in violation of injunction were void – Doctrine of lis pendens squarely applied – Purchasers could not claim protection under bona fide doctrine due to notice of pending suit and injunction – The Court distinguished Thomson Press (India) Ltd. v. Nanak Builders and Investors Pvt. Ltd., (2013) 5 SCC 397 and Yogesh Goel v. Govind Narayan, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 169, which were cited by the defendants to [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2379 Shyam Kumar Inani v. Vinod Agrawal & Ors. support protection of pendente lite purchasers – In those cases, the purchasers had either no notice or the dispute lacked injunction s at the time of sale – In contrast, here the purchasers had clear notice of the pending suit and express injunctive restraint. [Paras 33, 34.6-34.8] No enforceability bar due to vagueness – Boundaries identifiable – Undervaluation not conclusive of mala fides – The defendants also contended that the Agreement to Sell was vague and lacked specific demarcation of boundaries, and that the consideration was below market rate: Held: Agreement not invalid for lack of precise boundaries or lower- than-market consideration – No mala fides established – The Court clarified that minor imprecision in boundary description does not affect enforceability where the property can otherwise be identified with certainty – Further, undervaluation alone does not establish fraud or invalidate the contract when possession, consideration, and intention to perform are established.
