There is no distinction between those who retired (or died in service) before D 29.03.2010 and those who continued in service (and were given pay revision). They fell in the same class and a further distinction could not be made. The fact that the MSFC did not recover any interim relief or amount disbursed towards the 5th Pay Commission reaffirms that these ex-employees belonged to the E same class.
