The Inquiry Officer, upon completion of enquiry, recorded in his report dated 21.04.2006 that the charges levelled against the appellant are duly established. The District Judge, Bareilly accepted the inquiry report dated 21.04.2006 and vide dated 30.04.2007 dismissed the appellant which was challenged in appeal before the High Court and the same was dismissed vide dated 19.09.2007 being devoid of any substance while affirming the dated 30.04.2007 passed by the Disciplinary Authority imposing punishment of dismissal. 3.4 Being aggrieved by the dated 19.09.2007 passed by the Administrative Judge of the High Court of Allahabad, the appellant filed the Writ Petition (C) No. 297 of 2008 before the High Court which attained the same fate as that of the appeal. Hence, the present appeal. 4. Learned counsel for the appellant would submit that the first charge, in particular, is vague as no finding has been recorded by the Inquiry Officer with regard to the allegations made in the letter dated 05.06.2003 against the officials. Learned counsel would further submit that if it is presumed that the language used in the complaint constitutes flagrant breach of Rule 3 of the U.P. Government Servant Conduct Rules, the quantum of punishment imposed on the appellant is not commensurate to the guilt. Learned counsel for the appellant next submits that the appellant was not supplied copy of various documents including proposed evidence and thus he was prejudiced. 352 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports It is lastly argued that the findings of guilt recorded by the enquiry officer is perverse. In support of his submissions, learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on the decisions of this Court rendered in ‘Sawai Singh vs. State of Rajasthan’1 and ‘Santosh Bakshi vs. State of Punjab2’ 5. On the contrary, the learned counsel for the High Court would submit that the appellant is habitual of making false allegations against the senior officers including the District Judge and the charges framed against him are specific and definite and not vague. 6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and perused the case papers. 7. The appellant was subjected to the departmental inquiry on two charges of misconduct and insubordination. For the first charge, it was alleged that he used inappropriate, derogatory and objectional language and made false allegations against the Central Nazir and higher officials and earlier also he had lodged a false report against the Presiding Officer of Aonla Court. For the second charge, he allegedly sent a representation dated 05.06.2003 to the Registrar General of the High Court and Harijan Society Welfare Minister as also to the Chief Minister without using the proper channel and without permission of the Head of the Department. 8. The Inquiry Officer has found both the charges to be proved. In the discussion with respect to the first charge, it is mentioned in the inquiry report that the appellant’s statement in his letter dated 05.06.2003 that he met the Central Nazir, Bareilly number of times between 24.08.2001 to 15.01.2003 is false because from the dated 21.06.2003 of the District Judge, Bareilly it is clear that the Central Nazir took charge at Bareilly on 23.07.2002, therefore, he could not have met the Central Nazir, Bareilly before 23.07.2002.
