M/s Ambuja Cement Ltd. included in the aggregate of taxable turnover of purchases within the State for the purpose of reduction of tax credit under Section 11(3) (b) of the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the GVAT Act’). 3. Two substantial questions of law being framed by the High Court were as follows: - [1] Whether the Hon’ble Tribunal has erred in law and in facts in holding that value added tax paid on purchases is required to be excluded for computing “taxable turnover of purchases” under section 11(3) (b) of the Act? [2] Whether the Hon’ble Tribunal has erred in law and in facts by holding that purchases on which value added tax is neither claimed nor granted are required to be excluded for computing “taxable turnover of purchases” under section 11(3)(b) of the Act? 4. The learned senior advocate appearing for the Appellant has asserted that the Respondent dealer essentially calculated the taxable turnover of its purchases under the GVAT Act by excluding the Value Added Tax and value of purchases on which no tax credit was claimed and reduced the taxable turnover of purchases by four per cent on the quantity of goods involved in the manufacture of goods dispatched by way of branch transfer as has been provided in Section 11(3)(b) of the GVAT Act.
