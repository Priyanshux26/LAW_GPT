50 in Survey No. 7/2 of Akoli (bk) should have been taken being the highest exemplar. The learned senior counsel also submits that no deduction for development charges ought to have been made. According to learned counsel, since it is for the construction of a flood wall no development is required and in any event no compensation has been awarded for the portions of the land consisting of roads, lanes and open space. Learned counsel relied on Bhagwathula Samanna and Others Vs. Special Tahsildar and Land Acquisition Officer, Visakhapatnam Municipality, Visakhapatnam (1991) 4 SCC 506; Charan Dass (Dead) by LRs. Vs. H.P. Housing & Urban Development Authority & Ors. (2010) 13 SCC 398 and State of M.P. vs. Radheshyam, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 162. 102. Rebutting the arguments, Shri Uday B. Dube, learned counsel for the Vidharbha Industrial Development Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ‘VIDC’) contends that of the four sale deeds, Exh.75 dated 12.02.1999 was a transaction between unrelated parties. 2290 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The other three Exh.76, Exh.77 and Exh.78 were also executed just prior to the issuance of the Section 4 notification and were between the related parties. The sale deeds were executed just prior to the initiation of the acquisition and according to the State, the parties had full knowledge regarding sanction of the project for construction of flood control wall and as such sale deeds are suspicious in nature and are intended only for the purpose of getting more compensation for the plots which could not be sold for 15 to 16 long years. The State relied upon State of Maharashtra and Others Vs. Digamber Bhimashankar Tandale & Ors. (1996) 2 SCC 583 to contend that though the lands were converted for non-agricultural purpose, there was no development and hence compensation on per sq. ft. basis could not have been awarded. According to the State, the claimant owners were not available to sell a single plot for 15 to 16 long years. 103. It is further contended that the land extend to more than 7 lac sq. ft. in all the matters pertaining to the family and as such compensation at Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. relying on an exemplar sale deed involving sale of an area measuring 1500 sq. ft. was not justified. 104. The State vehemently argues that the intra family sale deed Exh. 78 dated 11.05.1999 executed just twenty-three days prior to the notification under Section 4 cannot be the basis for the award of compensation @ of Rs. 175/- per sq. ft. In fact, the claimants prayed only for an average compensation of Rs. 121.25/- per sq. ft. So praying, the State prayed for restoration of the award passed by Land Acquisition Officer. C. Findings of the High Court: 105. The High Court in the impugned has found that the land was reserved for development of residential tenements. It relied on Exh. 67 a notification dated 21.09.1984 published in the Government Gazette. In fact, the High Court records that the witness for the respondent-State had not countered this fact that the document was produced and the document had remained unrebutted.
