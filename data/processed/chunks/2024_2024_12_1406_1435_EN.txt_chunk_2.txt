Case Arising From CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 5544 of 2024 From the and dated 18.05.2023 of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in BA No. 253 of 2023 Appearances for Parties Tushar Mehta, SG, Arvind Kumar Sharma, Advs. for the Appellant. Akshay Bhandari, Ashish Batra, Advs. for the Respondent. 1410 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports / of the Supreme Court Bela M. Trivedi, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. The instant Appeal arises out of the impugned dated 18.05.2023 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in Bail Application No. 253 of 2023, granting bail to the respondent. It assumes importance as the said Bail Application has been allowed by the High Court solely on the ground of belated compliance of Section 52A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the NDPS Act’), misinterpreting the said provision, and without recording the findings as mandated in Section 37 of the said Act. Since the impugned involving seminal issue on the interpretation of Section 52A of the said Act is likely to have wide repercussions, we deem it proper to delve into the same in little greater depth. 3. PREFATORY FACTS: (i) As per the case of the prosecution, on 24.02.2022 an information was received by a Junior Intelligence Officer – Shri Sunil Kumar of the Appellant-Bureau with regard to a parcel bearing AWB No.
