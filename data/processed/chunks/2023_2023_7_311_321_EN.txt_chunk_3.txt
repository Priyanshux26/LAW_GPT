The High Court also recorded that the issue raised in the petition is otherwise also covered by various s. 6. The respondent no.1, Ravinder Kumar Jain had purchased the land in question vide registered sale deed dated 18.06.2003. The fact that he had knowledge about the acquisition of land, is evident from two B facts. Firstly, that it was sought to be pointed out by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 1 that he had obtained permission from the competent authority in terms of the provisions of the 1972 Act for transfer of the land, which had already been acquired. Though, in para 13 of the sale deed a vague averment has been made in C that regard, however, no such certificate was produced. Even production thereof may not be of any help to the respondent no. 1. Secondly, the writ petition was filed by the respondent no. 1 bearing W.P. (C) No.3701 of 2008 challenging the acquisition proceedings. The same was dismissed as withdrawn on 22.10.2008 with liberty to the petitioner therein to avail of the remedy of review/ recall of the dated 09.12.2004 vide which D the writ petition filed by the predecessor in interest of the respondent no.1, challenging the acquisition, was dismissed for non-prosecution. It is the admitted position that an application filed by the respondent No.1 for reviewing/ recalling was dismissed. 7. As regards the locus of a subsequent purchaser to invoke Section E 24(2) of the 2013 Act to claim that the acquisition had lapsed, the law is well settled. The three Judge Bench of this Court in Shiv Kumar (supra) while deciding the point in law has held as follows: “18. Even otherwise, proviso to Section 24(2) does not recognise a purchaser after Section 4 notification inasmuch F as it provides that where an award has been made, and the compensation in respect of a majority of landholdings has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries, then, all beneficiaries specified in the notification for acquisition issued under the 1894 Act, shall be entitled to compensation under the provisions of the 2013 Act. The proviso makes it G clear that in case of compensation concerning the majority of landholdings has not been deposited, then recorded owner(s) at the time of issuance of notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act shall have the right to receive the compensation. Purchasers after Section 4 notification have H 316 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A not been given the right to receive the higher compensation under the provisions contained in the 2013 Act. 19. The 2013 Act presupposes that a person is required to be rehabilitated and resettled. Such a person who has purchased after Section 4 notification as sale deed is void under the B 1894 Act, cannot claim rehabilitation and resettlement as per policy envisaged under the 2013 Act, as his land has not been acquired, but he has purchased a property which has already been acquired by the State Government, he cannot claim even higher compensation, as per proviso to Section 24(2) under the 2013 Act.
