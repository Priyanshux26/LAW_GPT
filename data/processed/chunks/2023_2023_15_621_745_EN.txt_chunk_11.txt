Conclusions ...........................................................................104 A. The reference 1. More than a century ago, James Joyce published Ulysses. Joyce experimented with the narrative technique by extensively using a stream of consciousness. In its modernist narrative technique, Ulysses is feted by literary critics and novelists as a literary masterpiece. Novelists such as Vladimir Nabokov and T S Elliot eulogized it as a divine work of art. However, others such as Virginia Woolf and Aldous Huxley criticized the novel for being technical and boring. Despite the varied criticism, the legacy of Ulysses endures particularly because its experimental narrative technique challenged the conventional literary style. Similar is the case of the group of companies doctrine – a modern theory which challenges the conventional notions of arbitration law. It is celebrated by some, reviled by many others. Yet, its legacy continues. 2. Five judges of this Court are called upon to determine the validity of the ‘Group of Companies’ doctrine in the jurisprudence of Indian arbitration. *Ed. Note: The pagination as per the original . COX AND KINGS LTD. v. SAP INDIA PVT. LTD. & ANR. 639 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] The doctrine provides that an arbitration agreement which is entered into by a company within a group of companies may bind non-signatory affi liates, if the circumstances are such as to demonstrate the mutual intention of the parties to bind both signatories and non-signatories.
