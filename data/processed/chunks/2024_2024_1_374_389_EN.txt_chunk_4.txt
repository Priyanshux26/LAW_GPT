16. It was contended that in the aforesaid , the terms of the agreement therein were identical to the instant Agreement, inasmuch as there was no reference to any tenant in the building and it was 380 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports stated that within six months, the plaintiff should purchase the stamp-papers and pay the balance consideration upon which the defendants shall execute the Sale Deed either in his name or the name(s) proposed by him before the Sub-Registrar. It was restated that there was no prior letter/notice from the plaintiffs (respondents) to the defendants (appellants) calling upon them to get the Sale Deed executed till the issuance of the Legal Notice dated 18.11.1997 i.e., after a gap of 6 ½ years, identical to the facts in K.S. Vidyanadam (supra). SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS: 17. In opposition to the appeal, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that on 23.03.1992, appellant no.1 had filed Original Suit No.551 of 1992 against her husband, mother-in-law, second wife of her husband and the son of the second wife, which was decreed. He submitted that appellants even after accepting Rs.425/- over and above the amount indicated in the Agreement and even after getting a decree for declaration and possession of the suit property in her favour on 24.07.1996, did not execute the Sale Deed due to which Legal Notice was sent to her on 18.11.1997. As no action was taken, the respondents were forced to file a suit on 23.03.1998 seeking specific performance. 18. Learned counsel submitted that the First Appellate Court had recorded that the Sale Deed executed by appellant no.1 in favour of appellant no.7 dated 05.11.1997 was not bonafide as the said sale was effected after getting an for declaration and recovery of possession of the suit property in favour of appellant no.1 on 24.07.1996 in Original Suit No.551 of 1992. 19. Learned counsel submitted that the issue whether time is the essence of the contract i.e., the Agreement would depend also on the conduct of the parties and in the present case, when money was accepted by appellant no.1, much after the stipulated time, clearly the Agreement’s validity so as to culminate in sale could not be said to have been extinguished, as by accepting money later, the time indicated for completion of the transaction by execution of Sale Deed had been relaxed. 20. It was contended that the actual intention of the parties was not only to execute the Sale Deed but also handover the possession [2024] 1 S.C.R. 381 Alagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr. which is an implied term of every sale of immovable property and thus only when on 24.07.1996, the appellant concerned became capable of handing over possession, limitation would start from such date as otherwise even if the Sale Deed was executed in favour of the respondents, it would have been of no real consequence in the absence of possession being capable of hand over. 21. Learned counsel contended that the stand taken by the appellants, that the proposed sale was only for transfer of title and not possession, cannot be accepted since the sale of immovable property is always for the transfer of possession from the seller to the buyer in terms of Section 5 read with Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (hereinafter referred to as the “TP Act”).
