In the aforesaid agreement, it was clearly mentioned that in case the litigation of the vendor regarding the property in question is not decided after one year, the vendee will have the right to get his earnest money back along with interest @ 18% per annum. In fact, the vendee had issued a notice on 22.03.2001 seeking refund of the earnest money. In the light of the aforesaid facts, the suit for specifi c performance fi led after dismissal of the suit for injunction was barred under Orde II Rule 2 CPC and deserved to be rejected. 26. However, the fact remains that all the aforesaid documents, referred to by the respondent in support of his plea for rejection of the plaint, cannot be considered at this stage as these are not part of the record with the Court fi led along with the plaint. This is the stand taken by the respondent-defendant in the application fi led under VII Rule 11 C.P.C. As noticed above, no amount of evidence or merits of the controversy can be examined at the stage of decision of the application under VII Rule 11 C.P.C. Hence, in our view, the impugned of the High Court passed in the Review Application deserves to be set aside. ed accordingly. 27. The Trial Court shall proceed with the suit. However, if considered appropriate, after pleadings are complete, the issue regarding maintainability of the suit can be treated preliminary. 28. The appeal is allowed in the manner indicated above.
