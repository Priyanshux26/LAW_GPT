Moreover, in the tenth meeting, the CoC had granted a ‘deemed post facto approval’ F to the revised plan and had not objected to any of its portions in the affidavit filed before NCLAT dated 09.09.2021. Therefore, it cannot be said that the procedure adopted in the present case amounted to a material irregularity. 28.6. Coming to the application filed by SBI for impleadment, G learned senior counsel would submit that SBI attended all meetings and voted in favour of the resolution plan, did not raise any objection before the NCLT or NCLAT and is receiving 100% of its dues under the resolution plan. Learned senior counsel has also referred to the in EBIX Singapore Pvt. Ltd. v. Committee of Creditors of Educomp Solutions Ltd. and Anr. : (2022) 2 SCC 401 to submit that the resolution H M. K. RAJAGOPALAN v. DR. PERIASAMY PALANI 847 GOUNDER & ANR. [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] plan between a successful resolution applicant and the CoC would be A binding. Thus, being a part of CoC, SBI cannot subsequently raise a contrary stand to the stand taken by the CoC. 28.7. On the aspect of commercial wisdom of the CoC, emphatic reliance has been placed on the decisions of this Court in K. Sashidhar, Maharashtra Seamless, Essar Steel, Jaypee Kensington, Kalpraj B Dharamshi (supra); and Pratap Technocrats (P) Ltd. and Ors. v. Monitoring Committee of Reliance Infratel Ltd and Anr. : 2021 SCC OnLine SC 569 to submit that scope of interference in matters concerning the successful resolution plan is extremely narrow, and the challenge is only limited to matters ‘other than’ enquiry into the autonomy C or commercial wisdom of the CoC as under Section 30(2) or 61(3) of the IBC. In the case at hand, since the resolution plan had been approved by the CoC there would be no case for any interference. 28.8. It has also been submitted on behalf of the resolution applicant that the CIRP had reached an advanced stage, resolution D applicant had given a bank guarantee of Rs. 25 crore on 01.02.2021 in pursuance of approved resolution plan, the initial amount of Rs. 150 crore, which was required to be remitted within 45 days of the approval of the resolution plan, was deposited within 15 days and the resolution applicant has always been ready with the remaining funds. It has also been vehemently submitted that deliberate dilatory tactics have been E adopted by the promoter to frustrate the process of CIRP, with substantial amount of time having been lost on account of the delays. 28.9. As regards the application bearing IA No. 168602 of 2022 in Civil Appeal Nos. 1682-1683 of 2022 filed by the promoter and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor - seeking permission to bring on record F subsequent facts that during the pendency of these appeals his proposal of settlement under Section 12-A of the Code was passed by CoC in its nineteenth meeting held on 12.10.2022 by 100% voting power of members - learned counsel for resolution applicant has submitted that the very consideration of Section 12-A application of the promoter by CoC had G been against the explicit direction of the Appellate Tribunal in the dated 17.02.2022, whereby only 15 days’ time was allowed to the CoC to examine the pending or existing Section12-A proposal of the promoter; and such a proposal was indeed rejected by the CoC on 25.03.2022.
