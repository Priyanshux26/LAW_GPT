02.08.2004 also, the same deserves to be dismissed. C Case set up by the appellants themselves was that they had not claimed any compensation against the owner of the vehicle, who is alleged to be the employer, while filing application before the Tribunal. It was for the reason that they wished to claim compensation under the 1923 Act. Once that was so, this fact being in their knowledge from the very beginning, delay of 9 years in filing application under the 1923 Act, is D certainly fatal for consideration of the claim by the appellants for award of compensation. In fact, the application before the Commissioner was filed only after the proceedings in the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal were concluded on 07.02.2003 and the appellants were not able to get any compensation in execution. The application before the Commissioner E was filed on 02.08.2004. Therefore, in our opinion, no sufficient cause is established for condonation of delay in filing the application. 16. For the reasons mentioned above, we do not find any infirmity in the impugned . The appeal is accordingly dismissed. There shall be no as to costs. F Nidhi Jain Appeal dismissed.
