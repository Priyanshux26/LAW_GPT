Under Section 16, the Arbitral Tribunal shall have the jurisdiction to determine the validity of the arbitration agreement. 83. A division Bench of this Court in Uttarakhand Purv Sainik G Kalyan Nigam Limited v. Northern Coal Field Limited24while placing reliance on Duro Felguera (supra) held that issues related to limitation must be raised before the Arbitral Tribunal. The Court observed the following: 24 (2020) 2 SCC 455 H 416 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A “7.8. By virtue of the non obstante clause incorporated in Section 11(6-A), previous s rendered in Patel Engg. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] and Boghara Polyfab [National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC 267], were legislatively overruled. The scope of examination is now confined only to the existence of the arbitration B agreement at the Section 11 stage, and nothing more.” 84. What the Courts at the pre-referral stage can examine under Section 11(6A) is only the “existence” of the arbitration agreement, while the Arbitral Tribunal shall have the jurisdiction to examine “any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement”. C 85. Section 45 of the Act, 1996 provides that: “Power of judicial authority to refer parties to arbitration.— Notwithstanding anything contained in Part I or in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908),a judicial authority, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made D an agreement referred to in section 44, shall, at the request of one of the parties or any person claiming through or under him, refer the parties to arbitration, [unless it prima facie finds] that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.” E (Emphasis added) 86. A plain comparison between Section 11(6A) and Section 45 manifests that the scope of Section 45 is much broader. Under Section 45, a judicial authority has to examine whether the agreement is “null and void”, “inoperative”, or “incapable of being performed”. F 87. This Court in World Sport Group (Mauritius) Limited v. MSM Satellite (Singapore) Pte. Limited,25in paras 33 to 35 explained the difference between the terms ‘null and void’, ‘inoperative’ and ‘incapable of being performed’ as under:- G “33. Mr. Gopal Subramanium’s contention, however, is also that the arbitration agreement was inoperative or incapable of being performed as allegations of fraud could be enquired into by the court and not by the arbitrator. The authorities on the meaning of the words “inoperative or incapable of being performed” do H 25 (2014) 11 SCC 639 M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 417 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [AJAY RASTOGI, J.] not support this contention of Mr. Subramanium. The words A “inoperative or incapable of being performed” in Section 45 of the Act have been taken from Article II(3) of the New York Convention as set out in para 27 of this .
