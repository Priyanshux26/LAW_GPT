Workmen v. Firestone Tyre & Rubber Co [(1973) 1 SCC 813, 832 : 1973 SCC (L&S) 341, 360 : (1973) 3 SCR 587, 612 : (1973) 1 LLJ 278] Workmen v. Buckingham and Carnatic Mills [(1970) 1 LLJ 26, 29 (SC)] and Glaxo Laboratories v. Presiding Offi cer Labour Court, Meerut [(1984) 1 SCC 1 : 1984 SCC (L&S) 42]” 9. The submission made by the learned counsel for the NFC Shri Arkaj Kumar is that since the appointment itself provides that disciplinary issues will be governed by the CCA Rules 1965, there should be no room for any doubt as to the applicability of the Rules in the disciplinary proceedings. This may not be always correct. An appointment cannot lay down terms of service which are against what is provided in the Standing s, as they are binding on the employer. This Court in the case of Western India Match Co. Ltd. v. Workmen (1974) 3 SCC 330 had directed reinstatement of a worker, who had been illegally terminated from service during his probation period, as this period was wrongly extended beyond what was permissible in the Standing s. This is what was said by this Court in Paragraph 11: “11. The special agreement, in so far as it provides for additional four months of probation, is an act in contravention of the Standing . We have already held that. It plainly follows from Sections 4, 10 and 13(2) that the inconsistent part of the special agreement cannot prevail over the Standing . As long as the Standing is in force, 105 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. it is binding on the Company as well as the workmen. To uphold the special agreement would mean giving a go-by to the Act’s principle of three-party participation in the settlement of terms of employment. So we are of the opinion that the inconsistent part of the special agreement is ineff ective and unenforceable.” In Sudhir Chandra Sarkar (supra) it was ultimately held by this Court that the terms of a statutory contract of service was illegal because it denied gratuity to an employer which was against the Standing s that were legally binding on the employer. 10. Standing s are defi ned under Section 2(g) of the 1946 Act as under: “2(g) “standing s’ means rules relating to matters set out in the Schedule” In the schedule to the 1946 Act, a whole list of topics is given which are related to workman, such as classifi cation of workmen, their attendance, closing and reopening of the industrial establishment to suspension or dismissal for misconduct and as to what constitutes misconduct, etc. The 1946 Act mandates under Section 3 that the employer shall submit before the certifying offi cer, draft standing s proposed by him, for adoption in his industrial establishment. The draft standing s after scrutinization under Section 4 of the 1946 Act are fi nally certifi ed under Section 5 of the 1946 Act. The standing s are then notifi ed under Section 7 of the Act, when it becomes eff ective.
