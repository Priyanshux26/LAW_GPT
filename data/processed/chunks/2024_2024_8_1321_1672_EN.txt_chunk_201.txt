Chinnaiah in the context of exposition of law in Indra Sawhney and in the light of the constitutional provisions more particularly Article 14, 15, 16 and 341 of the Constitution of India, let us have glance over the cardinal principles of interpretation of the Constitution laid down by this Court over the years in catena of decisions. 28. It cannot be gainsaid that the Constitution is construed to be a living and organic document, as it is intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs. It is required to be construed broadly and liberally however, in the words of Benjamin Cardozo, “a Judge is not a Knight errant roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty and goodness.
