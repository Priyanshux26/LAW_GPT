The appellant No.1 had specifically stated, not only in the plaint but also in his deposition, that respondent No.2 had executed the sale deed on 02.12.1985 after receiving the sale consideration. 2310 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 20.3. Respondent No.2, although filed a written statement making vague assertions but chose not to appear in the witness box apparently to avoid being cross-examined. 20.4. The first Appellate Court had decreed the suit of the appellant but no appeal was filed against the same by the respondent No.2. The only appeal filed before the High Court was by respondent No.1. 20.5. The objection as to the registration or the procedure adopted while registering the sale deed was essentially available to respondent No.2 but he did not raise it in the written statement. Further respondent no.2 neither cross-examined appellant No.1 nor did he enter the witness box nor did he assail the of the first Appellate Court decreeing the suit. 20.6. The only manner in which respondent No.2 could have challenged the sale deed in favour of the appellants was by way of either a counter-claim or by way of an independent suit praying for cancellation of the sale deed by impleading the registering authority, which he chose not to do. 20.7. As there was no counter-claim filed by the defendant, in particular, respondent No.2, the question of validity of execution and registration of the Sale Deed dated 02.12.1985 in favour of the appellant no.1 and his brother, could not be tested. 20.8. The Trial Court did not frame any issue with respect to the validity of the registration process or the registration of the sale deed by the registering authorities, after such a long gap of 26 years. Without framing such an issue, the Trial Court committed serious error and a patent illegality in recording a finding with regard to the registration process and commenting on the registering authorities. Even the High Court committed the same illegality. 20.9. There is no limitation provided under the law for a sale deed which had been executed and duly presented before the Registrar for registration, for such document to be registered within a particular time. Even if there was a gap of 26 years from the date of presentation till the date of registration, it would not make any difference and the sale deed would relate back to the date of execution once registered. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2311 Kaushik Premkumar Mishra & Anr. v. Kanji Ravaria @ Kanji & Anr. 20.10. The fact that the sale deed was duly executed on 02.12.1985 and thereafter presented for registration on 05.12.1985 is apparent from the fact that respondent No.2 on the same date i.e. 02.12.1985 had executed the sale deed for the remaining half portion of Survey No.13/1 in favour of collaterals of the appellant and further, the said sale deed in favour of the collaterals was also presented for registration on 05.12.1985 i.e. the same day on which the appellant presented the sale deed for registration.
