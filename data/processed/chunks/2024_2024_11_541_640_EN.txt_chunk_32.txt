We therefore partially overrule the decision in Annappa Irappa Nesaria (supra) for the view taken w.r.t the post-1994 amendment position. 45. Significantly, Section 10(2) states that a driving license ‘shall also be expressed as entitling the holder to drive a motor vehicle of one or more of the following classes’. Therefore, the driver of a ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ is not per se disentitled to acquire a license for a ‘Transport Vehicle’ class, for driving vehicles above the weight of 7,500 kgs or those classes which do not fall in the definition of Light Motor Vehicle under Section 2(21). As rightly noted in Mukund Dewangan (supra), Section 10 has to be read with Section 2(21) which defines a Light Motor Vehicle. III. Whether the interpretation in Mukund Devangan(2017) would render most provisions of the MV Act and MV Rules otiose? 46. For the Insurance Companies, it was argued with much emphasis that sole reliance on Section 2(21) r/w Section 10 as held in Mukund Dewangan (2017) would render otiose, many provisions of the MV Act and this can have far-reaching implications. To appreciate this contention, a careful examination of the identified provisions is necessary. Is it correct to say that in to drive a transport [2024] 11 S.C.R. 591 M/s Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rambha Devi & Ors. vehicle, an LMV license holder will require by law, an additional endorsement because the scheme of the Act provides a clear distinction between ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ and ‘Transport Vehicle’?
