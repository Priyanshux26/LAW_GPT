In that context, it is relevant to note that the oral testimony of DW-1 would reveal that during his examination he would admit the receipt of Rs.5,000/- under the Will. That apart his evidence would reveal that the firm was dissolved on 27.03.1987 and subsequently as per Exhibit P-8 (Memorandum of Understanding), the partnership was re-constituted. As per the division, the group to which DW-1 is a party got 62 acres of Coffee Estate known as Sheegekan Estate in Jaagra Village Chicmagalur District, a Tile Factory called Modern Tile Works in B.C. Road, Bantwal. He also deposed to the fact that under the Will executed by his father, he got 23 cents of land in Mangalore. Moreover, his evidence would reveal that the parties including himself who got such properties had subsequently sold them. This was relied on by the appellants to canvas the position that they would go to show that there was nothing unnatural about the exclusion of some of the children while making the Will. In this context, it is to be noted that a Will is usually executed to alter the natural mode of Succession and hence, consequential result of reduction or deprival of the share of a natural heir. If the testator does not intend so there is no necessity at all for executing a Will. 9 (2003) 8 SCC 537 156 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 20. In the said circumstances, we have no hesitation to hold that the trial Court had rightly considered all the circumstances to come to the conclusion that Ext.P2 Will was validly executed and it was proved by the appellants. The circumstances were taken as suspicious by the High Court sans foundation and the High Court erred in holding the subject Will dated 10.11.1992 as not proved. Hence, the and dated 21.11.2008 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore in M.F.A. No.3077 of 2001 is set aside and the and decree dated 20.02.2001 passed by the III Additional District Judge, Dakshina Kannada at Mangalore, in O.S. No.21 of 1997 is restored and confirmed. The appeal is accordingly allowed. There shall be no as to costs. 21. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand(s) disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Ankit Gyan
