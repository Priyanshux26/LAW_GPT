Headnotes† Contract Act, 1872 – s.11 – Registration Act, 1908 – s.85 – A Land measuring 3.40 Hectares was sold by respondent no.2 to appellants and collaterals of the appellants – Half of the total land (suit land) was purchased by appellants and other half by the collaterals of appellants – Respondent no.2 herein executed a Sale Deed (suit land) in favour of appellant no.1 and his minor brother (since deceased) on 02.12.1985 with respect to suit land and another sale deed was also executed with the collateral of the appellants – The sale deed (suit land) in favour of the appellant no.1 and his minor brother could not be registered and remained pending for registration before the Sub-Registrar on account of deficiency in stamp duty – On 03.12.2010 respondent no.2 executed a Conveyance Deed with respect to the suit land in favour of respondent no.1 – It is the same land which was transferred in favour of the appellant no.1 and his brother in December, 1985 – The appellants then followed up registration of their sale deed, * Author 2296 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports which was registered on 14.06.2011 – Appellant filed suit for cancellation of sale deed 03.12.2010 and the same was dismissed by the Trial Court – First Appellate Court allowed the appeal filed by the appellants – However, the High Court set aside the decision of the First Appellate Court and upheld the decision of the Trial Court – Correctness: Held: The Trial Court and the High Court had proceeded on the premise that the defendant No.1-the vendor (respondent no.2 herein) had denied the execution of the sale deed and had also denied that he had not received any consideration – This premise taken by both the Courts i.e. Trial Court and the High Court are contrary to the pleadings on record and the evidence led during the Trial – There is clear misreading of the evidence – In his written statement, defendant no.1 has not specifically denied anywhere that he had not executed the sale deed or that the signatures on the sale deed were not his signatures – Thus, the very premise on the basis of which the Trial Court and the High Court proceeded are perverse being contrary to the material on record – Both the said courts also failed to take into consideration that defendant no.1 the vendor (respondent no.2 herein) neither entered the witness box in support of his pleadings and to prove them, nor did lead any evidence, either oral or documentary, in support of his pleadings – There was no justification to treat a vague statement in the written statement of not recollecting about execution of sale deed, to be taken as a denial of the execution – The Trial Court and the High Court fell into the trap of clever drafting and a vague statement of defendant no.1 – The Trial Court and the High Court also committed a manifest error in recording that the defendant no.1- vendor (respondent no.2 herein) had denied having received any sale consideration with respect to the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 – In the written statement filed by the defendant no.1, there is no such statement made – Based upon the aforesaid two factual errors, the Trial Court and the High Court wrongly shifted the burden on the plaintiff to prove execution of the sale deed and also payment of the sale consideration – The impugned thus suffers from manifest error of law and facts both – It is not disputed by respondent No.2 that on 02.12.1985, he had executed another sale deed with respect to the remaining portion of the land in favour of the collaterals of the appellants – This sale deed in favour of the collateral was presented for registration on the same date as the sale deed of the appellant i.e.
