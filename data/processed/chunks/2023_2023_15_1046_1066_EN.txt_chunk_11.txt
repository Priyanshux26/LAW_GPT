17. Section 13B of the 1946 Act declares that to those workmen in an industrial establishment to whom the CCA Rules, 1965 are applicable, the provisions of the 1946 Act will not apply. The question which still remains is whether in to oust the 1946 Act a separate notifi cation under Section 13 B would be necessary as Section 13 B speaks of “…as may be notifi ed in this behalf by the appropriate Government in the Offi cial Gazette, apply”. The Andhra Pradesh High Court, in the impugned , though is of the opinion that there is some ambiguity in Section 13B of the 1946 Act as to whether a separate notifi cation is required for only unspecifi ed rules mentioned in Section 13B or will a separate notifi cation also be necessary for the specifi ed Rules such as CCA Rules, 1965. All the same, this question has been answered to a large extent by this Court in Hari Shankar Jain (supra). The question before this Court was whether the standing s would be applicable to a workman or will it be the regulations framed under the Electricity Supply Act, 1948. In the said case, there were standing s for the workmen, who were working for the U.P. State Electricity Board (as it was then), but subsequently a notifi cation was issued by the Government of India on 28th May, 1970 specifi cally under Section 13B of the 1946 Act. The notifi cation read as under: “In pursuance of the provision of Section 13-B of the Industrial Employment (Standing s) Act, 1946 (Act No. 20 of 1946), the 106 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Governor is pleased to notify in the offi cial Gazette that the U.P. State Electricity Board has made the following Regulations under sub-section (c) of Section 79 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 (Act No. 54 of 1948): Notwithstanding any rule if an or practice hitherto followed, the date of compulsory retirement of an employee of the Board will be the date on which he attains the age of 58 years; provided that— (i) in the case of the inferior servants of the Board, whose counterparts under State Government are at present entitled to serve up to the age of 60 years, the age of compulsory retirement will be the date on which they attain the age of 60 years. (ii) the Board or its subordinate appointing authority may require an employee to retire after he attains or has attained the age of 55 years on three months’ notice or three months’ salary in lieu thereof without assigning any reason.” We have also noticed that in the above case, there was a specifi c notifi cation under Section 13B of the 1946 Act, which admittedly is not there in the case at hand. What is important is that the notifi cation (in the above case), was not of a general nature but it was specifi c to “compulsory retirement”, of employees of the Electricity Board.
