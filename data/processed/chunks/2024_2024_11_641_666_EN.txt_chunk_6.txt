4 SCR 742 : (2006) 6 SCC 613 7 [1992] Supp. 1 SCR 592 : (1992) 4 SCC 653 8 [1976] 1 SCR 306 : (1975) 2 SCC 702 650 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports under Article 136, of the Constitution of India, the appellants would not acquire locus standi to challenge the dated 04.02.2022 passed by the High Court in exercise of its power under Section 482, Cr. P.C. The learned counsel relied on the decision of this Court in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India9 in support his contentions. 10. Before dealing with the contentions on behalf of the respondents and also the submissions of the learned amicus curiae and the counsel for the intervenor, we think it only appropriate to refer to certain relevant aspects of the POCSO Act. As introduction to the POCSO Act, what actually actuated the Parliament to enact ‘POCSO Act’ has been stated thus:- “Sexual offences against children are not adequately addressed by the existing laws. A large number of such offences are neither specifically provided with nor are they adequately penalised. Such offences against children need to be defined explicitly and countered through adequate penalties as an effective deterrence. This Act provides for protection of children from offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography with due regard for safeguarding the interest and well-being of children.” 11. Contextually, it is worthy to refer to the statement of objects and reasons for the enactment of the POCSO Act. It reads as follows: - “STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Article 15 of the Constitution, inter alia, confers upon the State powers to make special provision for children. Further, article 39, inter alia, provides that the State shall in particular direct its policy towards securing that the tender age of children are not abused and their childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and they are given facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity. 2. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children, ratified by India on 11th December, 1992, requires the State Parties to undertake all appropriate national, bilateral 9 (1981) Supp. SCC 87 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 651 Ramji Lal Bairwa & Anr. v. State of Rajasthan & Ors. and multilateral measures to prevent (a) the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity; (b) the exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices; and (c) the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials. 3. The data collected by the National Crime Records Bureau shows that there has been increase in cases of sexual offences against children. This is corroborated by the ‘Study on Child Abuse: India 2007’ conducted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Moreover, sexual offences against children are not adequately addressed by the existing laws. A large number of such offences are neither specifically provided for nor are they adequately penalised. The interests of the child, both as a victim as well as a witness, need to be protected.
