Thereafter, on 14.02.2023, she submitted a letter with the EWS Certifi cates for the Financial Year 2019-2020 and Financial Year 2021-2022 and, according to her, the same was received by the UPSC. This is, however, controverted by the UPSC by saying that mere delivery of the letter at the letter receiving section (Dak section) will not amount to acceptance of the same. 19. According to the petitioner, on 30.05.2023, she was informed, vide e-mail, that her candidature has been converted to General Category from EWS Category. Thereafter, the petitioner states that, on 21.06.2023, she sent a representation to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) seeking acceptance of her EWS Certifi cate for the Financial Year 2020-2021 received by her on 01.06.2023 and that she had not received any reply. She claims that she also e-mailed to the offi cial e-mail ID of the Chairman, UPSC but received no reply. 20. Being aggrieved, the petitioner has fi led this Writ Petition since she claims that she had secured All India Rank [AIR] 105 and if she were to be considered in the EWS Category, her cut-off would qualify her,for admission to the CSE-2022 in the IAS Cadre. In the Writ Petition, she has prayed for the following reliefs: “(i) Issue a Writ, or Direction in the nature of Certiorari for quashing email dated 30.05.2023 issued by Respondent no. l; (ii) Issue a Writ, or Direction in the nature of Mandamus directing the Respondents to retain the petitioner in the economically weaker section (EWS) category and accept the EWS certificate submitted by the petitioner for fi nancial year 2020-2021,for the purpose of recruitment pursuant to Civil Services Examination 2022; (iii) Issue a Writ, or Direction declaring Rule 13, Rule 27 (3) and Rule 28 of the Civil Service Examination Rules 2022, to the extent that it prescribes that candidates must be in possession of the EWS Certifi cate as on the closing date of the application for Preliminary Examination, to be ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India as being arbitrary;” DIVYA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 57 [K. V. VISWANATHAN, J.] 21. The detailed facts pertaining to the petitioners in W.P. (C) Nos. 705 and 764 have been set out in the later part of this . Insofar as the petitioners in W.P. (C) Nos. 705 and 764 are concerned, there is no dispute on one fact that with regard to all of them, the documents submitted with DAF-I were not the correct documents refl ecting their eligibility. Admittedly, there was some lacunae or the other which they claim were rectifi ed beyond the date of submission of DAF-I. The UPSC, in its counter affi davit, has clearly urged that with regard to the 298 EWS candidates, who were ultimately shortlisted, the I&AC as uploaded by them in DAF-I was scrutinized and they have rejected their candidature or converted some of them to the General Category. Stand of the UPSC: 22. The UPSC has fi led a detailed counter affi davit and has also fi led an additional affi davit explaining their position.
