6. The agreements between the parties were executed in terms of conditions of sale of the various forest produce. There were two Conditions of Sale Manuals produced before the High Court. The first manual was published in the year 1980-81 and the second manual was published in the year 1987-88. The High Court, in its , observed that there is cutting over the dates of both the manuals relating to application of the mentioned therein. In the first manual, in place of year 1980-81, it has been cut and made enforced for 1997-98 and in the second manual, in place of 1987- 88, it has been cut and made enforced for 1989-90. High Court also noted that the cuttings do not bear any signatures. 7. The Respondents, for their argument of non-forfeiture of security amount, relied heavily on sub-clause (viii) of Clause 10 of 1980-81 Terms & Conditions of Sale and Auction of Jungle Wood wherein it was provided that if the acceptance or rejection of sale of lots is not informed to the contractor after 40 days, then the contractor will not be bound to take the contract on the accepted bid. Whereas, the Appellants relied on the conditions contained in sub-clause (viii) of Clause 10 of 1987-88 Conditions of Sale, wherein it has been provided that if the approval of the concerned officer is not received within the stipulated period and if the competent authority approves the bid of the lot, then it will be deemed that the lot has been approved. 8. The High Court observed that the Respondents were relying on the conditions made applicable in 1997-98 while the Appellants were relying on the conditions made applicable in 1989-90 and since the auction was held in the year 1998, the conditions applicable in the year 1997-98 will govern the sale by auction pursuant to which agreements have been executed. Accordingly, since the Respondents/ contractors were not communicated about the approval or disapproval [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2431 Chief Conservator of Forest & Ors. v. Virendra Kumar & Ors. of sale of lots within 40 days, they were not bound by the said offer made in the said auction and could withdraw themselves. Thereby, it was held that the recovery sought to be made from the Respondents was illegal as being contrary to the Conditions of Sale contained in sub-clause (viii) of Clause 10 of the Terms & Conditions of Sale applicable in the year 1997-98. The Writ Petition was allowed by the High Court, setting aside the Appellant’s dated 17.01.2000 and directing the Appellants to refund the forfeited amount. 9. Aggrieved by the impugned , the Appellants are before us. An interim stay of the impugned of the High Court was granted by this Court vide dated 08.08.2011. 10. The case of the Appellants, largely, is that the relevant Manual operative in the Financial Year 1997-98 is that on which the Financial Year 1987-88 is printed. As per this Manual, the Clause 10 (viii) was amended and the condition of communicating the approval of the auction within 40 days was deleted.
