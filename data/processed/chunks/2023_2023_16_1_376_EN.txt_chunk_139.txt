a. The in Sampath Prakash 325. In Sampath Prakash v. State of Jammu and Kashmir249, proceedings under Article 32 of the Constitution were initiated challenging the validity of an of detention under the Jammu and Kashmir Preventive Detention Act 1964. The detention had been continued without making a reference to the Advisory Board, the State having purported to act 249 (1969) 2 SCR 365 198 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. under Section 13A. The provisions of Article 13A were challenged on the ground that they were ultra vires Article 22 of the Constitution. However, Article 35-C which was introduced by CO 48 of 1954 in exercise of power under Article 370(1)(d) had granted immunity to a law relating to preventive detention in Jammu and Kashmir against invalidity on the ground that it violated any right under Part III of the Constitution for a period of fi ve years.
