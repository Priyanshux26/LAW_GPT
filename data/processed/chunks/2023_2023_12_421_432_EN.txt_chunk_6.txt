The repealing provision is provided under sub-section (1) of Section 81 of FERA. This Court, in the case of M/s. P.V. Mohammad Barmay Sons v. Director of Enforcement1, interpreted clause (a) of sub-section (2) of Section 81 of FERA. Clause (a) of sub-section (2) of Section 81 of FERA reads thus: “81.Repeal and saving– (1) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. (2) Notwithstanding such repeal- (a) anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken (including any rule, notifi cation, inspection, or notice made or issued, or any appointment, confi rmation or declaration made or any licence, permission, authorisation or exemption granted or any document or instrument executed or any direction given or any proceedings taken or any confi scation 1 1993 Supp (2) SCC 724 430 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. adjudged or any penalty or fi ne imposed) under the Act hereby repealed shall, in so far as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of this Act; (b) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..; (c) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..; (d) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..: (3) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..” The issue before this Court was about the power of the authorities under FERA to investigate and enforce liability and penalty incurred under FERA, 1947, after its repeal. In paragraphs 7 to 9 of the aforesaid decision, this Court held thus: “7. Shri Tulsi, the learned Additional Solicitor General placing reliance on O. Abdul Aziz v. Addl. Director of Enforcement [AIR 1983 Mad 59:(1982) 2 MLJ 359] and A.K.L. Labbai Thambi Maraicar v. Govt. of India, Enforcement Directorate [AIR 1983 Mad 102:(1982) 2 MLJ 59] contended that in view of Section 81(2) of the Act read with Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, the power of the respondents to investigate and enforce the liability or penalty incurred under the Repealed Act is saved, though the Act 7 of 1947 has been repealed under sub-section (2) of Section 81 of the Act. The contention of the respondent is that the Repealed Act, after the Act had come into force in 1973, is a dead corpse and no life into it could be blown with the aid of Section 81(2) of the Act or Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. We fi nd no force in the contention. The eff ect of the repealed Act by operation of clause (e) of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act read with sub-section (2) of Section 81 is that, though the Act obliterates the operation of Act 7 of 1947, despite its repeal, the penalty, liability, forfeiture or prosecution for acts done while the repealed Act was in force were kept alive, though no action thereunder was taken when the Repealed Act was in force.
