4. The Trial Court framed the following six issues on the basis of the pleadings of the parties: (i). Whether the plaintiff is entitled for decree of declaration as prayed for? (ii). Whether the plaintiff is entitled for decree of permanent injunction as prayed for? (iii). Whether the husband of the 1st plaintiff executed a will on 16.07.2003? (iv). Whether the 2nd plaintiff is the legal heir of the deceased Arunachalam? (v). Whether the suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties? (vi). To what other relief? 5. The parties led oral and documentary evidence. Both the plaintiffs examined themselves as PW 1 and PW 2 and one Mathiyalagan was examined as PW 3 and they proved six papers Exh.A1 to A6. On behalf of the defendants one Balarajendra was examined as DW1 and he proved six papers Exh.B1 to B6. Both the defendants did not enter the witness box. 6. The Trial Court discussed the evidence threadbare and recorded the following findings: (i). Both the plaintiffs had pleaded that Arunachalam had executed a will on 16.07.2003 but they failed to prove the said will deed in accordance to the statutory provisions contained in Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and also under Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act, 1956. Thus, their claim on the basis of the will was not found to be substantiated; (ii). The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary parties as the co-owners/co-sharers were not impleaded as defendants; [2024] 1 S.C.R. 85 RAJENDHIRAN v. MUTHAIAMMAL @ MUTHAYEE & ORS. (iii). The plaintiffs were not the owners of the property in suit, they had not been able to prove the oral partition and as such were found to be not entitled to any relief. 7. Accordingly, it dismissed the suit, vide dated 08.09.2015. 8. The plaintiffs preferred an appeal which was registered as Appeal Suit No.55/2016. The Subordinate Court, Tiruchengodu, vide dated 27.11.2020, after considering the evidence on record, approved the findings recorded by the Trial Court and, accordingly, dismissed the appeal. Once again specific findings were recorded that the oral partition had not been proved by the plaintiffs. For the said purpose, both the Courts below had relied upon the evidence led by the parties, both oral and documentary. 9. The First Appellate Court also approved the finding regarding non- joinder of necessary parties. 10. Aggrieved by the same, the plaintiffs preferred Second Appeal before the High Court, registered as Second Appeal No.351/2021. The High Court proceeded on the premise that the only dispute was with respect to the oral partition, as to whether oral partition had taken place or not and if yes, whether it was duly proved? The High Court relied upon Ex.A-3, A-4 and Ex.B-3 to hold that there had been an oral partition. Ex.A-3 is the Mortgage Deed dated 13.10.2009. Ex.A-4 is the Sale Deed dated 15.07.1981. Ex.B-3 is the Sale Deed dated 02.05.2008. All these three documents were relied upon only for the reason that they mentioned boundaries.
