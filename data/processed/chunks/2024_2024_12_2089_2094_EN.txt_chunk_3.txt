Further, while the respondent has the right to visit the child, it cannot be at the cost of the child’s health and wellbeing. Keeping in mind the best interest of the child and the interests of the parents, we agree with the High Court to the extent of granting certain visitation rights to the respondent, but the directions and set up to enable the same appear to be adversarial to the child and require to be modified. 16. The directions passed by the High Court as well as the Family Court are not supported by any cogent reasons for allowing the visitation to take place at Karur. These s do not provide any justified reasons and do not appear to have kept the best interest and welfare of the child as paramount. Thus, keeping the interest and well being of the child as the priority, we deem it appropriate and just to move the place of visitation from Karur to Madurai. 17. Considering the best interest of the child, her tender age, and health, we direct that: i. Respondent shall be allowed to visit the minor daughter every Sunday between 10:00 AM and 02:00 PM. ii. Such visits shall take place in Madurai, in a public park or a temple premises, and in the presence of the appellant 2094 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports considering the child’s tender age. The appellant, though must be present, shall stay at a distance of approximately 10 feet. iii. The child shall be handed over to the respondent at the place of visit in Madurai at 10:00 AM on Sundays and be returned to the appellant by 02:00 PM. 18. The appeal is accordingly partly allowed, in respect of the limited question of place of visitation, and the of the High Court is modified to the extent of the above directions. 19. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal partly allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Vidhi Thaker, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Liz Mathew, Sr. Adv.)
