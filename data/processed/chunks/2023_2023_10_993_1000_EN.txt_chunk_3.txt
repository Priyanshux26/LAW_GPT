The learned counsel also pointed out that under clause (m) of Section 5, whoever commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below twelve years, is C guilty of committing aggravated penetrative sexual assault. He would, therefore, submit that the High Court has committed an error by holding that Section 6, which applies to aggravated penetrative sexual assault, was not applicable. 6. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent–accused D submitted that the respondent has already undergone the sentence of seven years as modified by the High Court. He submitted that now the respondent is completely reformed. He also stated that the respondent has moved ahead in life and in fact, recently he got married. He would, therefore, submit that it would be unjust at this stage to apply Section 6 E of the POCSO Act and send the respondent to jail to undergo further sentence. OUR VIEW 7. There is no dispute about the correctness of the finding recorded in paragraph 16 of the impugned of the High Court, which we F have quoted above. In this context, it is necessary to note the definition of ‘penetrative sexual assault’ incorporated in Section 3 of the POCSO Act. Clause (a) of Section 3 reads thus: “3. Penetrative Sexual Assault.- A person is said to commit “penetrative sexual assault” if – G (a) he penetrates his penis, to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra or anus of a child or makes the child to do so with him or any other person; or (b) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

Section 2(a) of the POCSO Act provides that ‘aggravated penetrative sexual assault’ has the same meaning as assigned to it in Section 5. Therefore, we come to Section 5, which defines ‘aggravated B penetrative sexual assault’. Clause (m) of Section 5 reads thus: “5.Aggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault. – (a) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. (b) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
