14. It appears from the decision in Canon India (supra) that the Notification No. 44/2011-Cus-NT dated 06.07.2011 designating officers of DRI 220 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports as “proper officers” for the purposes of both Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 respectively; the introduction of Section 28(11) vide the Validation Act, 2011 introducing Section 28(11) empowering such officers for the period prior to 06.07.2011; the statutory scheme as envisaged under Sections 3, 4, 5 and 2(34) of the Act, 1962 respectively; and the pendency of the appeal against the decision in Mangali Impex (supra) and the stay of the operation of the said decision by this Court was either not noticed or not brought to the notice of the Court. 15. The Department preferred the present Review Petition against the judgement delivered in Canon India (supra) on 09.03.2021. This judgement was followed in other cases adjudicated by this Court and the High Courts, resulting in various other Review Petitions, Special Leave Petitions and Civil Appeals. This Court vide dated 15.02.2022 in the present Review Petition allowed an open court hearing to be conducted and after hearing the parties, issued notice on the Review Petition vide dated 19.05.2022. A co-ordinate Bench of this Court later in Union of India and Another v. Godrej and Boyce Manufacturing (SLP (C) No. 1513/2022) through dated 11.02.2022 also issued notice. 16. The aforesaid developments led to a hiatus. As a result, the appeals pending before the Tribunals and other authorities could not be decided. This necessitated the introduction of the following provisions by Parliament: Sections 86, 87 and 88 in the Finance Act, 2022 (Act No. 6 of 2022) to amend Sections 2(34), 3 and 5 of the Act, 1962 respectively. Further, Sections 94 and 97 of the Finance Act, 2022 introduced a new Section 110AA and a validation enactment respectively. These amendments came to be challenged before this Court in W.P. (C) 526 of 2022 titled Daikin Air Conditioning India Pvt. Ltd v. Union of India. 17. The present batch comprises of three clusters of matters: (i) The Review Petitions in the Canon India (supra) batch; (ii) The Mangali Impex (supra) appeal and other appeals pending before this Court on the issue of whether the officers of DRI would be proper officers in light of Section 28(11); and (iii) The petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022.
