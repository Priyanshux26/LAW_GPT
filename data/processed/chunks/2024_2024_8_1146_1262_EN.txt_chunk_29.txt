4.5. That the Washability Report of CIMFR, Nagpur for the year 2009 had stated that the rejects had a GCV of 1094 Kcal/kg and less and therefore, the same could not have been utilized in the BTPS. For the said reason, KECML had used the rejects for captive consumption of the mine i.e. for levelling, piling etc. The very same Report was also referred to by KPCL in its reply to the audit objections raised by CAG to state that no loss has been caused to KPCL since the rejects were in the nature of stones and boulders and did not have useful heat value. 4.6. To substantiate their submission that the rejects did not have the requisite GCV for being utilized in the BTPS, learned counsel have quoted a Circular issued by the NITI Aayog in the year 2020 which states that coal rejects having GCV of 1500 Kcal/kg are to be used in back filling of mines and can be used in construction of highways, roads etc. whereas rejects having GCV in the range of 1500 Kcal/kg to 2200 Kcal/Kg, can be used in FPC Boilers. 47 Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 395-398 of 2022 1200 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 4.7. That at the time of filing the chargesheet on 04th January, 2018, the respondent-CBI completely ignored the judgement dated 24th March, 2016 passed by the Karnataka High Court in the writ petition filed by the appellants against KPCL wherein it has been clearly held that KPCL does not have any right over the rejects generated during the process of mining and resultantly, the demand letter dated 31th July, 2014, issued by KPCL was set aside. The said judgement has also been upheld by this Court vide judgement dated 20th May, 2022. 4.8. That KPCL has been blowing hot and cold. First, it had filed objections to the quantification of coal rejects as recorded by the CAG in its Report but when its objections were rejected by the CAG, it changed its stand and proceeded to raise an illegal demand on the appellants on the basis of the very same CAG Report, which has been quashed by the High Court. 4.9. That both, the Karnataka High Court and this Court having quashed the demands made by KPCL in respect of the value of rejects to the tune of ₹ 52 Crore, no case has been made out by the respondent-CBI to prosecute the appellants particularly when on the advice of the Central Vigilance Commission,48 the Central Government refused to grant sanction for the prosecution of Mr. Yogendra Tripathi (IAS), Managing Director, KPCL and Mr. R. Nagaraja, Director (Finance) of KPCL and nominee Director on the Board of KECML. A different treatment cannot be meted out to the appellants. 4.10. That the respondent-CBI has solely relied on the Report of the CAG of 2013 to launch its prosecution in the year 2015. However, the Report of the CAG has not been approved by the Parliament in accordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 19(A) and other provisions of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 197149 read with Articles 148 to 151 of the Constitution of India.
