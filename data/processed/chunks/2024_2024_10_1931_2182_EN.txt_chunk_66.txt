Hence, the regulatory power in relation to intoxicating liquor lay with the Provincial legislatures and not the Federal legislature. Where Entry 16 of the Provincial List of the Devolution Rules as well as Entries 45 of List I and 40 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the 1935 Act used the term ‘alcoholic liquors’, Entry 31 of List II used the expression ‘intoxicating liquors’. This term was first used in the 1935 Act. 93. The Seventh Schedule to the Constitution also placed the regulatory powers and the taxing powers relating to alcohol in separate entries. Entry 8 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution deals with ‘intoxicating liquors’. Entry 8 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution varies from Entry 31 of List II of the 1935 Act in a significant manner. Entry 8 only deals with ‘intoxicating liquor’. It does not cover narcotic drugs and opium. Entry 31 conferred the Provincial Legislature, the competence to legislate with respect to 2018 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports narcotic drugs which included opium. It was subject to Entries in List I and List II which dealt with opium167 and ‘poison and dangerous drugs’.168 The Seventh Schedule to the Constitution placed opium in List I169 and List III,170 completely removing it from List II. 94. Entry 84 of List I deals with duties of excise of goods except a few. The Entry read as follows before the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2016: “84. Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India except- (a) Alcoholic liquors for human consumption (b) Opium, Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics, But including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub-paragraph (b) of this entry.” (emphasis supplied) 95. Entry 51 of List II deals with duties of excise, inter alia, on alcoholic liquor: “51. Duties of excise on the following goods manufactured or produced in the State and countervailing duties at the same or lower rates on similar goods manufactured or produced elsewhere in India:- (a) alcoholic liquors for human consumption; (b) opium, Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics; but not including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub- paragraph (b) of this entry.” (emphasis supplied) 167 Government of India Act 1935, Entry 31 of List I 168 Government of India Act 1935, Entry 19 of List III 169 Constitution of India 1950, Entry 59 of List I 170 Constitution of India 1950, Entry 19 of List III [2024] 10 S.C.R. 2019 State of U.P. & Ors. v. M/s Lalta Prasad Vaish and sons 96. The only change with respect to the legislative competence on duties of excise from the 1935 Act is that Parliament (and not the State Legislature as it was envisaged under the 1935 Act) has the competence to enact laws with respect to medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or narcotic substances, opium and Indian hemp.171 97.
