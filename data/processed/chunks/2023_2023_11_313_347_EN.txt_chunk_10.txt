• It is submitted that the fact that the complaints may have been initiated by reason of political vendetta is not in itself ground for quashing the criminal proceedings. • That the section 482 of the Cr.P.C. provides:- “482. Saving of inherent powers of High Court — Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or aff ect the inherent powers of the High Court to make such s as may be necessary to give eff ect to any under this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.” • That this Hon’ble Court has held in Monica Kumar (Dr.) v. State of U.P. reported as (2008) 8 SCC 781, that inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr. P. C has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only when such exercise is justifi ed by the tests specifi cally laid down in the section itself. • That further, it is pertinent to mention that this Hon’ble Court has held in case Mrs. Dhanalakshmi Vs R. Prasanna Kumar, reported as AIR 1990 SC 494 that in exceptional cases, to prevent of the powers of Court, the High Court might in exercise of its inherent powers under section 482 Cr. P.C. quash criminal proceedings. However, interference would only be justifi ed when complaint did not disclose any off ence, or was patently frivolous, vexatious or oppressive. 328 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R.
