27. It is submitted that the jurisdiction of this Court under Section 22 of the NGT Act is very limited and an interference is warranted only when the court finds that there is an error apparent on the face of record in the findings of the NGT. 28. It is submitted that if the directions issued by the NGT, which provide for a precautionary approach, are not followed and the construction activities as provided in the development plan are carried out, it will be disastrous for future generations and will result in calamities like frequent landslides due to floods and earthquakes, cloudbursts and other natural disasters resulting in loss to the human lives and property. It is therefore submitted that the present appeals as well as the transferred case arising out of the writ petitions pending before the High Court are liable to be dismissed. Submissions on behalf of the Interveners/Land Owners: 29. It was argued on behalf of the interveners who were owners of the plots in “Green Belt” areas that on account of the restrictions imposed in the “Green Belt” areas, they were deprived of enjoyment of their 13 [2019] 4 SCR 995 : (2019) 18 SCC 494 : 2019 INSC 315 14 [2022] 8 SCR 154 : (2022) 11 SCC 493 : 2022 INSC 47 15 (1997) 11 SCC 605 16 [2023] 1 S.C.R. 601 : (2023) 8 SCC 643 : 2023 INSC 22 [2024] 1 S.C.R. 993 The State of Himachal Pradesh and Others v. Yogendera Mohan Sengupta and Another property which would be violative of Article 300A of the Constitution of India. It was therefore submitted that a direction be given to the State to pay compensation to such owners for not being in a position to utilize their plot of lands. We prima facie find that such an issue could be beyond the scope of the present proceedings. IV. CONSIDERATION: A. Legislative Scheme of the TCP Act. 30. It will be apposite to refer to the Preamble of the TCP Act, which reads thus: “An act to make provision for planning and development and use of land; to make better provision for the preparation of development plans and sectoral plans with a view to ensuring that town planning schemes are made in a proper manner and their execution is made effective to constitute the Town and Country Development Authority for proper implementation of town and country development plan, to provide for the development and administration of special areas through the Special Area Development Authority17, to make provision for the compulsory acquisition of land required for the purpose of the development plans and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.” 31. It can thus be seen that the TCP Act has been enacted to make provision for planning and development and use of land; to make better provision for the preparation of development plans and sectoral plans with a view to ensuring that town planning schemes are made in a proper manner and their execution is made effective.
