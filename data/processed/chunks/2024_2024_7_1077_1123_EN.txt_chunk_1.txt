[Paras 39, 40] Contempt of Courts Act – Role of contempt petitioner is only as an informer – The endeavour of the court in contempt petition is to uphold the majesty, dignity and prestige of the courts: Held: The role of a party, who brings a petition for contempt and activates the court’s machinery, is merely that of an informer – Whether or not to take the assistance of the petitioning informer is a question which invariably must be left entirely to the discretion of the court seized of the proceedings – In exercising its jurisdiction to punish for contempt, the courts in India do keep in mind the [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1079 S. Tirupathi Rao v. M. Lingamaiah & Ors. benefit that could accrue to the petitioning informer (if he is a party to the parent proceedings out of which the contempt arises) upon implementation of the alleged to have been wilfully disobeyed; but more than anything else, the endeavour is to uphold the majesty, dignity and prestige of the courts. [Paras 45, 46] Contempt of Courts Act – Section 20 – Civil Procedure Code – VII Rule 6 – Condonation of Delay in approaching the High Court for contempt – The contempt petitioner cannot choose a time convenient to him to approach the Court: Held: Even in case of a petition disclosing facts constituting contempt, which is civil in nature, the petitioner cannot choose a time convenient to him to approach the Court – The statute refers to a specific time limit of one year from the date of alleged contempt for proceedings to be initiated; meaning thereby, that the action should be brought within a year, and not beyond, irrespective of when the proceedings to punish for contempt are actually initiated by the High Court – In an appropriate case, it would be open to the party who has not petitioned the court within the period of one year, as stipulated in Section 20 of the Act, to seek exemption from the law of limitation in line with the principle flowing from VII Rule 6, CPC, by showing the ground upon which such exemption is claimed – Applicability of the principle underlying VII Rule 6, CPC for granting exemption would only be just and proper having regard to the object and purpose for which the jurisdiction to punish for contempt is exercised by the courts if, of course, the court is satisfied that benefit of such an exemption ought to be extended in a given case. [Para 55] Contempt of Courts Act – Section 20 – Limitation period for filing contempt petition – Interpretation thereof – Explained: Held: Stale claims of contempt, camouflaged as a “continuing wrong/breach/offence” ought not to be entertained, having regard to the legislative intent for introducing section 20 in the Act which has been noticed above – Contempt being a personal action directed against a particular person alleged to be in contempt, much of the efficacy of the proceedings would be lost by passage of time – Even if a contempt is committed and within the stipulated period of one year from such commission no action is brought before the court on the specious ground that the contempt has been continuing, no party should be encouraged to wait indefinitely to choose his own time to approach the court.
