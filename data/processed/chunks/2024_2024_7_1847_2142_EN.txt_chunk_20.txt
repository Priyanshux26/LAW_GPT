3 SCR 152 : (2004) 9 SCC 362 1878 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports courts should take only a detached decision based on the pattern of the well-settled principles of administrative law. If any such decision is based on irrelevant consideration or non-consideration of material or is thoroughly arbitrary, then the court will get in the way. Here the only point to consider is whether the decision-making agency took a well-informed decision or not. If the answer is “yes”, then there is no need to interfere. The consideration in such cases is in the process of decision and not in its merits.” (Emphasis supplied) 25 (a) 2. Furthermore, this Court in the case State of NCT of Delhi v. Sanjeev (2-Judge Bench)6 elaborated on when judicial review should be exercised vis-à-vis decisions of the Government. It was observed: “16. If the power has been exercised on a non-consideration or non-application of mind to relevant factors, the exercise of power will be regarded as manifestly erroneous. If a power (whether legislative or administrative) is exercised on the basis of facts which do not exist and which are patently erroneous, such exercise of power will stand vitiated. (See CIT v. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. [(1983) 4 SCC 392 : 1983 SCC (Tax) 336 : AIR 1984 SC 1182] 17. The court will be slow to interfere in such matters relating to administrative functions unless decision is tainted by any vulnerability enumerated above; like illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. Whether action falls within any of the categories has to be established. Mere assertion in that regard would not be sufficient. x x x x 21. In other words, to characterise a decision of the administrator as “irrational” the court has to hold, on material, that it is a decision “so outrageous” as to be in total defiance of logic or moral standards. Adoption of “proportionality” into administrative law was left for the future. 6 [2005] 3 SCR 151 : (2005) 5 SCC 181 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1879 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. 22. These principles have been noted in the aforesaid terms in Union of India v. G. Ganayutham [(1997) 7 SCC 463 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 1806]. In essence, the test is to see whether there is any infirmity in the decision-making process and not in the decision itself. (See Indian Rly. Construction Co. Ltd. v. Ajay Kumar [(2003) 4 SCC 579 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 528].” (Emphasis supplied) 25 (a) 3. The scope of this judicial review of administrative action was also discussed by this Court in Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa (2 - Judge Bench).7 In this case, the Court held that the purpose of judicial review is to check whether the decision has been made lawfully and not as to whether such decision is sound or not. 25 (a) 4. This Court in Villianur Iyarkkai Padukappu Maiyam v. Union of India, (3-Judge Bench)8 observed that: “167. In the matter of policy decisions and economic tests the scope of judicial review is very limited.
