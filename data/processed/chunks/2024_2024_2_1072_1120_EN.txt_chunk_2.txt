By Courts Motion 1076 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports / of the Supreme Court A. Heard learned Amicus, Mr. Siddharth Luthra, Senior Advocate Mr. Gaurav Agarwal for National Legal Services Authority (hereinafter referred to as “NALSA”) and Additional Solicitor General of India, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati for the Union. B. We have perused the compliance affidavits filed by the respective States, Union Territories, Central Bureau of Investigation and NALSA on the directions issued by this Court in the reported in Satender Kumar Antil v. Central Bureau of Investigation, (2022) 10 SCC 51 and the periodical s passed therein. The learned Amicus having gone through these compliance affidavits in great detail has submitted a tabular chart and report dated 10.02.2024 indicating the directions that have been complied with by the parties present before us in terms of the passed by this Court in Satender Kumar Antil (Supra) case. C. For the comprehensive implementation of the directions in Satender Kumar Antil (Supra) case, the Amicus upon thorough study and verification of the details forcefully argues that certain directions fall within the domain of States/Union Territories/CBI, and High Courts and a few directions fall within the domain of both the States and the High Courts. Therefore, for effective monitoring by this Court it is completely desirable to combine the stake holders for reporting in a convenient way and are heard on a particular day. D. The directions contained in para 100.2, 100.4, 100.7 of Satender Kumar Antil (Supra) and also the directions to public prosecutors in terms of dated 21.03.2023 of this Court need top most attention and are required to be complied with by States, Union Territories and CBI as per the time schedule stipulated. E. So far as the directions in para 100.2, 100.3, 100.5, 100.6, 100.7, 100.8, 100.9, 100.10, 100.11 of Satender Kumar Antil (Supra); the direction dated 03.02.2023 for inclusion of the in Siddharth v. State of UP, (2022) 1 SCC 676 and Satender Kumar Antil (Supra) in the curriculum of judicial academies and the direction dated 21.03.2023 for application of the in Satender Kumar Antil (Supra) to Section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as “CrPC”), by and large [2024] 2 S.C.R. 1077 Satender Kumar Antil v. Central Bureau of Investigation and Anr. apply to High Courts. From a larger perspective, direction in a few paragraphs is complied with by both i.e. the States/Union Territories and High Courts, in consultation with each other. The suggestion of Amicus informs that directions individually obligated are carried out independently and where mutual consultation in complying with the directions is necessary, such consultation is undertaken and responsibility is fixed on one authority for due compliance. F. The report dated 10.02.2024 is accepted by us in its entirety and therefore, now we issue directions for due compliance by the States/Union Territories/CBI and High Courts.
