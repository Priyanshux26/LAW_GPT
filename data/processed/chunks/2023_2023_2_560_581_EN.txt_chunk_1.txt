The Division Bench of the High Court has committed a manifest error in passing of the impugned while setting aside the of D the appellant dated 11th December, 2020 to conduct a preliminary inquiry against respondent no.1 in exercise of powers under Section 20(1) of the Act, 2014 which is in violation of the principles of natural justice. [Paras 25, 26, 27][572-F-H; 573-B-C] 1.2 Even on merits, the Division Bench has completely E overlooked Section 20(1) of the Act, 2014 that empowers the Lokayukta, on receipt of a complaint, obviously after recording satisfaction, in its discretion if intended to proceed and to hold any inquiry, can conduct either a preliminary inquiry against a public servant by its inquiry wing or any other agency to ascertain whether there exists a prima facie case for proceeding in the F matter or hold investigation by any agency or authority empowered under any law to investigate whether there exists a prima facie case. So far as the term ‘any agency’ is concerned, it clearly manifests from Section 25 of Chapter VIII which entrusts the power of superintendence to the Lokayukta to exercise in such a manner so as to require any agency, including the State G Vigilance and Crime Branch. [Paras 28, 29][573-D-E] 1.3 At the same time, under Section 28, for the purpose of conducting any preliminary inquiry or investigation, it is open for H 562 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A the Lokayukta to utilize the services of any officer or organization or investigation agency of the Government and, in the circumstances, if the appellant in its judicious discretion and on the facts and circumstances of the case, conduct a preliminary inquiry through an agency of the Government of which reference has been made under Section 28 through the Directorate of B Vigilance, Cuttack, there appears no legal infirmity being committed by the appellant in the decision-making process in conducting a preliminary inquiry whichwas within the scope and ambit of Section 20(1) of the Act, 2014 and a manifest error was committed by the Division Bench of the High Court while setting C aside the of the appellant dated 11th December, 2020 to conduct an inquiry against respondent no.1. [Para 30][573-F-H; 574-A] 1.4 Although this Court may not appreciate the action of the appellant in taking further steps when there was stay of the D impugned passed by this Court, but at the same time, an opportunity was granted to the respondents as well to justify if the action taken by the appellant is not in conformity with the mandate of the Act, 2014, but from the written submissions placed before this Court, no valid objection was found to have been raised by the respondents which may call upon this Court to E interfere in furtherance of the action being taken by the appellant after the preliminary inquiry report was submitted pursuant to dated 11th December, 2020. [Para 33][574-D-F] 1.5 The rule against bias is an essential component of modern administrative law.
