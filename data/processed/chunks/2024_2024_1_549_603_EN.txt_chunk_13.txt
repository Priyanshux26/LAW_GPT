Therefore, the lack of sanction was rightly found not to be a ground for quashing of the proceedings.” 18. I shall test later in this as to whether the remand proceeding before the Special Judge was mere irregularity or fatal, but before that I have to answer the question as to whether the protection of Section 17A is applicable in the case of the appellant. 19. Large part of Mr. Salve’s arguments was devoted to the proposition that the content of Section 17A of the 1988 Act was procedural in nature and relying on the s of this court in the cases of (i) Anant Gopal Sheorey -vs- State of Bombay [AIR 1958 SC 915]; (ii) Rattan Lal -vs- State of Punjab [AIR 1965 SC 444]; and (iii) CBI -vs- R.R. Kishore [2023 INSC 817], he has argued that the said provision is retroactive and not retrospective. His submission is that the amended provision applies at the starting point of enquiry, inquiry, or investigation, even though the offence may relate back to a period when the requirement of obtaining previous sanction was not necessary for starting these processes. I have already referred to Section 19 of the 1988 Act which requires the Court to satisfy itself whether such sanction stated therein has been taken at the stage of taking cognizance. So far as acts of a public servant in making recommendation or taking decision in discharge of official duties are concerned, an entry point check, prior in time has been contemplated for the investigating agencies. Thus, the requirement of taking prior approval would arise at that stage, being the beginning or commencing of enquiry, inquiry, or investigation. In my view a plain reading of the said Section leads to such an interpretation. Section 17A does not distinguish between alleged commission of offence prior to 26.07.2018 or post thereof. This provision stipulates the time when any enquiry, inquiry or investigation is commenced by a police officer. Mr. Rohtagi drew my attention to the of this Court in the case of State of Rajasthan -vs- Tejmal Choudhary [2021 SCC Online SC 3477] to refute Mr. Salve’s submissions on this point. In this , a Coordinate Bench has held that the Section 17A of the 1988 Act is 568 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports substantive in nature and is therefore applicable prospectively. The same view has been taken by different High Courts but as I have an authority of this Court on this point, I do not consider it necessary to refer to all these High Court Judgements. 20. In the case of Tejmal Choudhary (supra) the FIR was registered on 01-01-2018 and the accused public servant sought quashing of the FIR on the ground of introduction of Section 17A in the 1988 Act. In para 10 of this , the Coordinate Bench observed that:- “10. In State of Telangana v. Managipet alias Mangipet Sarveshwar Reddy reported (2019) 19 SCC 87, this Court rejected the arguments that amended provisions of the PC Act would be applicable to an FIR, registered before the said amendment came into force and found that the High Court had rightly held that no grounds had made out for quashing the proceedings.” In the present case, original FIR was registered on 09.12.2021 and the appellant was implicated in the aforesaid offences on 08.09.2023.
