Chenga Reddy transferred his share in favour of Govindammal in the year 1963 by way of a settlement deed dated 5th May, 1963. It is urged that thereafter, Govindammal, enjoyed uninterrupted possession of the property to the extent of 2/3rd. 2.2 In 1986 the original settlement deed in favour of Govindammal was given to Markandeya Reddy to bring into effect the 2/3rd share of Govindammal in the official records since at that time no partition by metes and bounds was effected and without prejudice to their rights, they had been cultivating random, separate portion(s) of the land. Such change was, allegedly never effected and neither were the documents returned to her. As such the suit for partition was filed on 30th March, 1995. 2.3 Plaint In the plaint following prayers were made :- “ ... ... ... (9) The plaintiffs therefore pray that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to pass a decree. (a) for partition and separate possession of 2/3rd share from out of the suit properties in favour of the plaintiffs and to put the plaintiffs in possession of the same. (b) directing the defendant to pay cost of the suit and 1 In certain places the record reflects alias of Venkata Reddy as Bachi Reddy Or Bakki Reddy 2 In certain places the record reflects alias of Chenga Reddy as Renga Reddy [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2333 Ramachandra Reddy (Dead) Thr. LRs. & Ors. v. Ramulu Ammal (Dead) Thr. LRs. (c) such other reliefs as this Honourable court may deem fit proper in the circumstances of the case and render justice accordingly.” 2.4 Written Statement  In the written statement filed by the original defendants, it has been averred that in the year 1984 the Panchayat decided on a division between the parties giving one-half of the property to both. Patta was not separated for 48-78 acres. His right and title extend to 25½ acres.  Survey No.201/1 was incorrectly included in the name of the defendant, and when change thereof, was applied for by Govindammal, the same was carried out without any objection. Survey Nos.201/L and 201/B were incorrectly shown against the name of Govindammal and actually belonged to the defendant.  There is a lake on the property to which the defendant had half right.  The plaintiff is not in joint possession of properties and is not entitled to the relief of partition. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE TRIAL COURT 3. The Trial Court framed the following issues: "1. Whether the marking of the suit properties are correct or not? 2. Whether the suit properties are properties of the plaintiff? 3. Whether the settlement deed executed in the year 1963 have been brought into force? 4. Whether the partition made in the year 1964 is genuine? 5. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for partition as prayed? 6. What are the other relief?” Having considered the first four issues, the Court, in answer to the fifth issue, concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to 2/3rd share of the property.
