The appellants have challenged the dated 20.12.2017 passed by the High Court of Delhi. Vide aforesaid , writ petition filed by the respondents was allowed holding that in view of Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (for short “the 2013 Act”), the acquisition in respect to the land in dispute, has lapsed. C 4. From the facts of the case as are available on record, it is evident that vide notification dated 23.06.1989 issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 large chunk of the land including the land of petitioner comprised in Khasra No.1 Etc/57/1 and Khasra No.1 Etc/ 58/1, situated in revenue estate of village Ghonda, Chauhan Khadar, D New Delhi was sought to be acquired for planned development of Delhi. It was followed by the notification issued under Section 6 dated 20.06.1990. The Award was announced on 19.06.1992. 5. A writ petition was filed in the High Court invoking Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act claiming that the acquisition in question has lapsed E as neither possession has been taken nor the compensation therefor has been paid. The appellant’s stand before the High Court was that the possession of the land was taken on 06.12.2012 and handed over to the DDA on the spot. The compensation could not be paid to the recorded land owners as they never came forward to claim the same. F 6. The High Court relying upon the of this Court in Pune Municipal Corporation & Anr. v. Misirimal Solanki & Ors. (2014) 3 SCC 183 held that since the compensation was not paid to the landowners, i.e., the respondents herein, the acquisition in question has lapsed. G 7. The arguments raised by learned counsel appearing for the appellants are that in view of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal and Others (2020) 8 SCC 129 whereby earlier of this Court in Pune Municipal Corporation & Anr.’s case (supra) was overruled, the passed by the High Court is liable to be set aside.
