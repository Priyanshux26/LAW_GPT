Placing reliance on the documents annexed to the application for permission to fi le additional documents (IA No.61474 of 2022), he submitted that even in 2014, full benefi ts under the Government dated 15th November 1999 were extended to similarly placed employees. 5. Learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the State of Karnataka submitted that the s passed in the Writ Petition fi led by Shri N. Ramesh are per incuriam since the Government dated 4th July 2008 which incorporated the clarifi cation issued on 19th October 2006 by UGC was not brought to the notice of the Courts. He pointed out that by a and dated 29th April 2011 passed by the Division Bench of Karnataka High Court in Writ Appeal no.234 of 2007 (State of Karnataka & Anr. v. Puttaswamy and Ors. ), the benefi t of the Government dated 15th November 1999 was denied to the similarly placed employee on the basis of the dated 19th October 2006 of UGC. He submitted that the dated 4th July 2008 issued by the State Government is in terms of the of UGC dated 19th October 2006, which lays down that the benefi t of revised pay scales with eff ect from 1st January 1996 shall be extended from 27th July 1998 notionally and all fi nancial benefi ts shall be extended prospectively from 4th July 2008 and that the employees will not be entitled to arrears. The learned Additional Advocate General, therefore, submitted that the view taken by the High Court is fully justifi ed. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 6. It is not in dispute that the case of Shri N. Ramesh in Writ Petition No. 5855 of 2008, decided by the learned Single Judge of Karnataka High Court on 13th February 2009, was similar to the present appellants. The learned Single Judge held that the said Shri N. Ramesh was entitled to the benefi t of the revised UGC pay scale from 1st January 1996 based on the dated 15th November 1999. Shri N. Ramesh had superannuated on 28th February 2006 as Physical Education Director from a Government aided college. The of the Karnataka High Court attained fi nality as a B.C. NAGARAJ & ANR. v. THE STATE OF KARNATAKA 239 & ORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.] Writ Appeal preferred against the and the Special Leave Petition have been dismissed. 7. It appears that the dated 19th October 2006 issued by UGC and the dated 4th July 2008 issued by the State Government were not pointed out to the learned Single Judge who decided Writ Petition of Shri N. Ramesh on 13th February 2009. Even in the appeal before the Division Bench and in the Special Leave Petition before this Court, both the s were not brought to the notice of the Court. The State Government never applied for the review. It is true that in the subsequent decision of the Division Bench of the same High Court dated 29th April 2011 in Writ Appeal no. 234 of 2007, the High Court noted the directions issued by the UGC on 19th October 2006 and the Government dated 4th July 2008 based on the directions of UGC and held that the Government employees were not entitled to a revised pay scale with retrospective eff ect.
