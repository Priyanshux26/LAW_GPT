Royal metals could be mined only after payments in the form of royalties were made to the Crown. The use of the word “royalty” underwent change in the United Kingdom with the decentralization of the sovereignty which was absorbed by the landowners.133 Land ownership was concentrated in the hands of landowners, who conceded the right to work mines to lessees in return for consideration which took the form of dead-rent and royalties.134 95. This Court has had occasion to analyze the meaning of the expression “royalty” in its decisions. In H R S Murthy v. Collector of Chittoor,135 a Constitution Bench observed that royalty connotes a payment made for materials or minerals won from land. In D K Trivedi v. State of Gujarat,136 the distinction between “royalty” and “dead rent” was explained thus: “39. In a mining lease the consideration usually moving from the lessee to the lessor is the rent for the area leased (often called surface rent), dead rent and royalty. Since the mining lease confers upon the lessee the right not merely to enjoy the property as under an ordinary lease but also to extract minerals from the land and to appropriate them for his own use or benefit, in addition to the usual rent for the area 131 [1995] Supp. 4 SCR 53 : (1995) 6 SCC 166. 132 Ramanatha Aiyar, Advanced Law Lexicon (Volume 3) 2789. 133 J U Nef, The Rise of the British Coal Industry (Routledge, 1966) 134 Royal Commission on Mining Royalties, Final Report of the Royal Commission Appointed to Inquire into the Subject of Mining Royalties (1893) 4. 135 [1964] 6 SCR 666 [6] 136 [1986] 1 SCR 479 : (1986) Supp. SCC 20 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1639 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. demised, the lessee is required to pay a certain amount in respect of the minerals extracted proportionate to the quantity so extracted. Such payment is called “royalty”. It may, however, be that the mine is not worked properly or as not to yield enough return to the lessor in the shape of royalty. In to ensure for the lessor a regular income, whether the mine is worked or not, a fixed amount is provided to be paid to his by the lessee. This is called “dead rent”. “Dead rent” is calculated on the basis of the area leased while royalty is calculated on the quantity of minerals extracted or removed. Thus, while dead rent is a fixed return to the lessor, royalty is a return which varies with the quantity of minerals extracted or removed. […]” (emphasis added) 96. Minerals are exhaustible and finite resources. Each quantity of mineral removed leads to the depletion of the mineral stock of the mine.137 Under a mining lease, a lessee acquires a right or interest in minerals. This right or interest allows the lessee to extract minerals and consume them. Royalty is a payment made by the lessee to the lessor or proprietor of the minerals for the removal of minerals.
