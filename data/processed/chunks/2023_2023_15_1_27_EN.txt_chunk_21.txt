Per contra, we fi nd that the yawning infi rmities and gaps in the chain of circumstantial evidence in this case warrant acquittal of the appellants by giving them the benefi t of doubt. The degree of proof required to hold them guilty beyond reasonable doubt, on the strength of circumstantial evidence, is clearly not established. RAJESH & ANR. v. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH 27 [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] On the above analysis, we allow the appeals and set aside the conviction and sentences of all the three appellants on all counts. They shall be set at liberty forthwith, if their continued incarceration is not validly required in connection with any other case. Fine amounts paid by them, if any, shall be refunded within eight weeks from today. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals allowed. Divya Pandey
