Deeds and Documents– Unregistered documents – Title with respect to immovable properties, if could be transferred on the basis of unregistered documents: Held: No title could be transferred with respect to immovable properties on the basis of an unregistered Agreement to Sell or on the basis of an unregistered General Power of Attorney – The Registration Act, 1908 clearly provides that a document which requires compulsory registration under the Act, would not confer any right, much less a legally enforceable right to approach a Court of Law on its basis – Even if the Agreement to Sell and the Power of Attorney were registered, still it could not be said that the respondent would have acquired title over the property in question – No right, title or interest in immovable property can be conferred without a registered document – The of this Court in the case of Suraj Lamps & Industries case lays down the same proposition – The embargo put on registration of documents would not override the statutory provision so as to confer title on the basis of unregistered documents w.r.t immovable property – Argument advanced on behalf of the respondent that the in Suraj Lamps & Industries would be prospective is also 590 SHAKEEL AHMED v. SYED AKHLAQ HUSSAIN 591 misplaced – The requirement of compulsory registration and eff ect on non- registration emanates from the Registration Act and the Transfer of Property Act – Ratio in Suraj Lamps & Industries only approves the provisions in the two enactments – Earlier s of this Court have taken the same view – Respondent could not have maintained the suit for possession and mesne profi ts against the appellant, who was admittedly in possession of the property in question whether as an owner or a licensee – Impugned set aside, suit dismissed – Registration Act, 1908 – ss.17, 49 – Transfer of Property Act, 1882 – s.54.
