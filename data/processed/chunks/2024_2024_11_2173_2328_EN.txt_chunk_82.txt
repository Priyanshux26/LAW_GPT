165. At the Section 11 stage, a referral court only has to determine the existence of arbitration agreement. The validity of the arbitration clause providing for the procedure for appointment of arbitrators will require the referral court to enter into a detailed consideration of evidence and render a finding as to law and facts. This issue should be left to be decided by the arbitral tribunal in view of the doctrine of competence-competence. The arbitral tribunal is competent to rule on its jurisdiction, including the issue of validity of the arbitration clause for violating the equality principle under the Arbitration Act. I. Prospective Overruling 166. A decision of this Court has retrospective effect unless expressly given a prospective effect. Commercial relations are structured on the basis of law. A change in law may have the effect of distorting established rights and commercial bargains between parties.304 To avoid large-scale social and economic disruption, this Court can exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 142 to give prospective effect to its decisions.305 The application of the doctrine of prospective overruling results in the application of the law declared by 303 In re Interplay between Arbitration Agreements under Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 and Stamp Act 1899 (supra) [196] 304 Somaiya Organics (India) Ltd. v. State of UP (2001) 5 SCC 519 [46] 305 Belsund Sugar Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar (1999) 9 SCC 620 [112] [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2277 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company this Court to cases arising in future.306 In Mineral Area Development Authority v. Steel Authority of India,307 eight Judges of this Court held that the doctrine of prospective overruling is applied to bring about a smooth transition of the operation of law without unduly affecting the rights of people who acted upon the overruled law. 167. In Bharat Aluminium Company v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services,308 a Constitution Bench of this Court prospectively overruled Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S A309 observing: “197. The in Bhatia International [(2002) 4 SCC 105] was rendered by this Court on 13-3-2002. Since then, the aforesaid has been followed by all the High Courts as well as by this Court on numerous occasions. In fact, the in Venture Global Engg. [(2008) 4 SCC 190] has been rendered on 10-1-2008 in terms of the ratio of the decision in Bhatia International [(2002) 4 SCC 105]. Thus, in to do complete justice, we hereby , that the law now declared by this Court shall apply prospectively, to all the arbitration agreements executed hereafter.” 168. In the present reference, we have upheld the decisions of this Court in TRF (supra) and Perkins (supra) which dealt with situations dealing with sole arbitrators. Thus, TRF (supra) and Perkins (supra) have held the field for years now. However, we have disagreed with Voestalpine (supra) and CORE (supra) which dealt with the appointment of a three-member arbitral tribunal. We are aware of the fact that giving retrospective effect to the law laid down in the present case may possibly lead to the nullification of innumerable completed and ongoing arbitration proceedings involving three- member tribunals.
