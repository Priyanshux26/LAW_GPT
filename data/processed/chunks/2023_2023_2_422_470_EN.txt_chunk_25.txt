(as he then was) observed that “reasonable restrictions” which the State could impose on the fundamental rights “should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature, beyond what is required in the interests of the public”. 31. “Reasonable” implied intelligent care and deliberations, D that is, the choice of a course which reason dictated. Legislation which arbitrarily or excessively invaded the right could not be said to contain the quality of reasonableness unless it struck a proper balance between the rights guaranteed and the control permissible under Articles 19(2) E to (6). Otherwise, it must be held to be wanting in that quality. Patanjali Sastri, C.J. in State of Madras v. V.G. Row [(1952) 1 SCC 410 : AIR 1952 SC 196 : 1952 SCR 597 : 1952 Cri LJ 966] , observed that the Court must keep in mind the “nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency F of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time”. This principle of proportionality vis-àvis legislation was referred to by Jeevan Reddy, J. in State of A.P. v. McDowell & Co. [(1996) 3 SCC 709] recently. This level of scrutiny has been G a common feature in the High Court and the Supreme Court in the last fifty years. Decided cases run into thousands. 32. So far as Article 14 is concerned, the Courts in India examined whether the classification was based on intelligible differentia and whether the differentia had a reasonable nexus H RAMESH CHANDRA SHARMA v. STATE OF UTTAR 461 PRADESH [KRISHNA MURARI, J.] with the object of the legislation. Obviously, when the Courts A considered the question whether the classification was based on intelligible differentia, the Courts were examining the validity of the differences and the adequacy of the differences. This is again nothing but the principle of proportionality. There are also cases where legislation or rules have been B struck down as being arbitrary in the sense of being unreasonable [see Air India v. Nergesh Meerza [(1981) 4 SCC 335 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 599] (SCC at pp. 372-373)]. But this latter aspect of striking down legislation only on the basis of “arbitrariness” has been doubted in State of A.P. v. McDowell C and Co. [(1996) 3 SCC 709] . 33. In Australia and Canada, the principle of proportionality has been applied to test the validity of statutes [see Cunliffe v. Commonwealth [(1994) 58 Aust LJ 791] Aust LJ (at 827, 839) (799, 810, 821)]. In R. v. Oakes [(1986) 26 DLR (4th) D 200] Dickson, C.J. of the Canadian Supreme Court has observed that there are three important components of the proportionality test. First, the measures adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the objective in question. They must not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational E considerations. In short, they must be rationally connected to the objective. Secondly, the means, must not only be rationally connected to the objective in the first sense, but should impair as little as possible the right to freedom in question.
