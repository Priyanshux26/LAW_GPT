The legislative entries must be given a wide meaning – All incidental and ancillary matters which can be fairly and reasonably comprehended must be brought within them – However, if there is an overlap between two entries the Court must endeavour to interpret the entries harmoniously – While interpreting the entries harmoniously, it must be ensured that no entry is rendered redundant – This principle of construction applies 1938 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports equally to entries within the same List and entries within different lists – The principle of parliamentary supremacy must be applied only when the attempted reconciliation by the above methods of interpretation fails. [Para 51] Constitution of India – Entry 8 of List II – Usage of phrase “that is to say”: Held: [Per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI, for himself and for Hrishikesh Roy, Abhay S Oka, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, Satish Chandra Sharma, Augustine George Masih, JJ.] The expression ‘that is to say’ in Entry 8 of List II cannot be interpreted to circumscribe the scope of the entry – The words that follow ‘that is to say’ are illustrative and explanatory of the scope of the provision – The expression does not limit the scope of the entry – Thus, the scope of Entry 8 of List II cannot be limited to the ‘production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase and sale’ of Intoxicating Liquor.
