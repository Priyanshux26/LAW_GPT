Conclusion ..........................................................................43 1. A batch of writ petitions filed before this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution in February 2023, raised concerns over the precipitate decline in investor wealth and volatility in the share market due to a fall in the share prices of the Adani Group of Companies.1 The situation was purportedly caused by a report which was published on 24 January 2023 by an “activist short seller”, Hindenburg Research about the financial transactions of the Adani group. The report inter alia alleged that the Adani group manipulated its share prices and failed to disclose transactions with related parties and other relevant information in violation of the regulations framed by SEBI and provisions of securities’ legislation. Significantly, the report expressly states that Hindenburg Research took a short position in the Adani group through US-traded bonds and non-Indian traded derivative instruments. A. Factual background and submissions 2. A brief overview of the petitions follows: a. The petitioner in WP(C) No. 162 of 2023, raises concerns about the drastic fall in the securities market, the impact on investors, the purported lack of redressal available and the disbursement of loans to the Adani group allegedly without due procedure. The petitioner inter alia seeks the constitution of a committee 1 “Adani group” [2024] 1 S.C.R. 179 VISHAL TIWARI v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS monitored by a retired judge of this Court to investigate the Hindenburg Report; b. The petitioner in WP (C) No. 201 of 2023 submits that the Adani group is in violation of Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 by “surreptitiously controlling more than 75% of the shares of publicly listed Adani group companies, thereby manipulating the price of its shares in the market.” The petitioner inter alia seeks a court-monitored investigation by a Special Investigation Team2 or by the CBI into the allegations of fraud and the purported role played by top officials of public sector banks and lender institutions; c. The petitioner in WP (Crl.) No. 57 of 2023 seeks directions to the competent investigative agencies to (i) investigate the transactions of the Adani group under the supervision of a sitting judge of this Court; and (ii) investigate the role of the Life Insurance Corporation of India and the State Bank of India in such transactions; d. The petitioner in WP (Crl.) No. 39 of 2023 seeks the registration of an FIR against a certain Mr Nathan Anderson (the founder of Hindenburg Research) and his associates for short-selling and directions to recover the profits yielded by short-selling, to compensate the investors. 3. When the batch came up for hearing on 10 February 2023, this Court noted that there was a need to review the existing regulatory mechanisms in the financial sector to ensure that they are strengthened with a view to protect Indian investors from market volatility.
