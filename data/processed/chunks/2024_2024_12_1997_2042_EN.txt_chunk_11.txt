Article 14 of the Concession Agreement, in the light of these mitigating circumstances, therefore, is not opposed to public policy. (h) NTBCL is currently facing losses and has not yet recovered the Total Project Cost or returns. The CAG Report indicates that, at a minimum, Rupees 30 crores remain recoverable by the Appellant, as of date. Thus, the High Court erred in concluding that NTBCL had fully recovered the Total Project Cost and has made reasonable profits. Additionally, if the High Court’s decision were upheld, NTBCL would be compelled to continue bearing maintenance costs until 2031 without any incoming revenue. Following the cessation of toll collection, NTBCL has become entirely dependent on the revenue generated from advertising hoardings. However, the Court has failed to take notice that NTBCL shares its revenue with NOIDA through license fees for outdoor advertisements. (i) NOIDA’s failure to provide regular fee hikes as per the terms of the Concession Agreement has contributed to the escalation of the Total Project Cost and as such, NOIDA cannot be [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2013 Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd. v. Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association and Others permitted to benefit from the impugned . As stipulated in Clause 14.2 of the Concession Agreement, the aggregate of gross revenue from fee collections, income from advertising, and development income (minus Operation and Maintenance expenses) should yield 20% of the Total Project Cost annually. Consequently, the Appellant should be permitted to continue collecting user fees. (j) The annulment of the Concession Agreement would deter future investors and undermine the sentiment for investment in similar projects. Instead, the residents in proximity to the project could be offered concessional treatment, while frequent users could benefit from discounted pricing. c. Contentions on behalf of Respondent no. 1 6. Per contra, Mr. Parthiv Goswami, Learned Senior Counsel, representing the Respondent Welfare Association, supported the findings of the High Court and urged as follows: (a) The Writ Petition was maintainable as it was filed promptly after NTBCL’s Chartered Accountant’s report was made available to the Respondents on 31.05.2012, revealing that users of the DND Flyway were being subjected to an illegal tax. Given that the cause of action is continuous, the issue of delay is irrelevant. The irreversible injury suffered by commuters necessitated examination on its merits, and therefore, no exceptions, including delay and laches, can be allowed to be raised to question the maintainability of the petition. (b) The Writ Petition cannot be turned down at the outset merely on the ground that users have two alternative routes available, which do not require payment of user fees or tolls. The Project in question constitutes public property, and the Concession Agreement necessitates judicial scrutiny and potential intervention. (c) The High Court correctly concluded that Article 13 of the Concession Agreement suffered from excessive delegation and was inconsistent with the provisions of the 1976 Act, thereby determining that NTBCL could not levy any user fees. Until the insertion of Section 6A of the 1976 Act on 14.08.1998, NOIDA lacked the authority to empower a developer to collect 2014 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
