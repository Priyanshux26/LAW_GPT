Accused no.3 was given the benefit of doubt and was acquitted due to lack of evidence linking him to the assault. 27.6 The courts have carefully evaluated the evidence against each accused and tailored their sentences accordingly. The appellant’s argument for parity fails to recognize the qualitative differences in their roles and the gravity of their actions. The appellant’s actions were not only more severe but also demonstrated a clear intent to cause death. The fatal injuries inflicted on the deceased, as detailed in the post-mortem report, leave no room for doubt about the appellant – accused no. 1’s culpability. The courts below have correctly observed that the appellant’s role in the crime is incomparable to that of his co-accused. 27.7 The principle of parity does not apply in the present case, as the appellant’s actions were materially different from those of his co-accused. The sentence imposed on the appellant reflects the gravity of his offense and his individual culpability. 28. Plea of old age and deteriorating health: 28.1 Another ground taken by the appellant for reduction in sentence is that he is a senior citizen and has severe health concerns necessitating continuous treatment and physiotherapy. This Court had once previously granted interim bail to the appellant on medical grounds owing to the fact that he had suffered a stroke and partial paralysis as a result. 28.2 The Court is cognizant of the appellant’s advanced age and deteriorating medical condition, considerations that warrant a humane and compassionate approach to justice. These factors, when presented in cases of serious offences, often invite the judiciary to weigh individual circumstances against the broader interest of justice. However, the Court is also tasked with balancing these personal hardships against the severity and nature of the offence, as well as its impact on the rule of law and societal harmony. 416 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 28.3 In the present case, the appellant has been convicted of murder, committed in the course of a group attack fueled by political rivalry. The act was not one of sudden provocation or impulse but arose from a premeditated and collective intent to harm the victim, even if the initial intention was to cause hurt. The evidence unequivocally establishes that the appellant actively participated in the attack, which culminated in the brutal stabbing of the victim in vital parts of the body, leading to his death. Such an act, carried out with the clear objective to eliminate the victim, underscores its heinous nature and deliberate execution. 28.4 While this Court has carefully considered the appellant’s plea for leniency on account of old age and a medical condition, these factors alone cannot absolve or mitigate the responsibility for a crime of this magnitude. A murder committed with the intent to target vital organs, particularly in a group setting, reflects a level of intent and cruelty that demands an appropriate punitive response. To reduce the sentence in such a case would risk undermining the seriousness of the crime and the sanctity of life itself, principles that the judicial system is duty-bound to uphold.
