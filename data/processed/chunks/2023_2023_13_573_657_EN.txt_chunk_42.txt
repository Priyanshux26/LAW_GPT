(1999) 8 SCC 667 (vii) CC v. Dilip Kumar and Company (2018) 9 SCC 1 (viii) Indo International Industries v. CGST (1981) 2 SCC (ix) UOI v. Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd. 1963 Supply (1) SCR 586 COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. AHMEDABAD v. M/S URMIN 629 PRODUCTS P. LTD. AND OTHERS [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] 95. M/s. Nisha Bagchi, learned counsel for the Revenue would contend that the declaration fi led by the assessee classifying their product as 2403 9910 was approved and s were passed by the Deputy Commissioner upto 23.09.2015 though a higher rate had been prescribed for ‘zarda/ jarda scented tobacco’ by Notifi cation No.25 of 2015 dated 30.04.2015 which product was manufactured by the assessee. She would contend that ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was notifi ed under Section 3A of CE Act, vide Notifi cation No.17 of 2010 dated 13.04.2010 and by Notifi cation No.18 of 2010 dated 13.04.2010, the CTPM Rules were amended to cover ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’. She would contend that the declarations fi led by the assessee were determined and/ or adjudicated after aff ording a personal hearing and by relying upon the admission/statement made by the General Manager of the assessee during the personal hearing, the Deputy Commissioner has modifi ed all subsequent declarations which came to be confi rmed by the appellate authority. She would also place reliance upon the CRCL report to contend that the samples drawn from one of the units had a pleasant odour/fragrance. She would draw the attention of the Court to the fi ndings recorded by the tribunal which is to the eff ect that the use of saff ron and scented fl avour in the manufacture of the product had been admitted by the General Manager; and, one unit of the same group was manufacturing an identical product which was being classifi ed as ‘zarda/ jarda scented tobacco’ and both these products had the same brand name and was entering the market as the same product. She would also contend that the appellant had not contested that manufacturing process which was identical and both products were marketed under the same brand name. She would also submit that the classifi cation of the product ought to have been under CET SH 2403 9930 and there cannot be estoppel in taxation matters for rectifying the past erroneous classifi cation/ declaration which was approved pursuant to intentional misdeclaration and wilful suppression. To conclude her arguments, she would submit that the adjudicating authority and the tribunal have considered the factual matrix and arrived at a well- reasoned conclusion based on the characteristics of the product, the test reports applying the commercial parlance, admission of the assessee, and the defi nitions found in IS glossary and existing precedents. Hence, by relying upon the following s she has sought for dismissal of the appeals: 630 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. (i) CCE v.
