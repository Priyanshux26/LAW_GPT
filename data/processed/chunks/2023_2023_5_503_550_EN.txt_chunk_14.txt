SUBMISSIONS OF THE PETITIONERS 9. Shri Ravi Shankar Jandhyala, the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners has made detailed submissions. The summary B of his submissions is as under: (a) That the 2nd proviso to clause (3) of Article 170 of the Constitution lays down that until the figures for the first census taken after the year 2026 have been published, it shall not be necessary to readjust the total number of seats C in the Legislative Assembly readjusted on the basis of the 1971 census and the division into territorial constituencies as may be readjusted on the basis of 2001 census. The exercise undertaken of delimitation/readjustment of the Assembly and Parliamentary Constituencies of Union Territory of J & K by appointing the Delimitation D Commission under the impugned notification dated 6th March 2020 is completely in violation of 2nd proviso to clause (3) of Article 170. Similarly, the 3rd proviso to Article 82 imposes an embargo on the readjustment of allocation of seats in the House of the People readjusted on the basis of the 1971 E census and the division of States into territorial constituencies as may be readjusted on the basis of the 2001 census till the figures of the first census conducted after 2026 are available. A similar embargo has been imposed by Articles 330 and 332 of the Constitution on reserving the seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes till figures of the F first census conducted after 2026 are available; (b) Earlier, the embargo was applicable till figures of the first census taken after the year 2000 were available. It was modified by the Constitution (84th Amendment Act, 2001) by substituting the year 2026 for the year 2000. The G Government cannot undermine the objects and reasons for the said amendment; (c) Till the figures of the first census conducted after the year 2026 become available, the number of members of the Legislative Assembly of the States remains the same. H HAJI ABDUL GANI KHAN & ANR. v. UNION OF INDIA & 523 ORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.] Therefore, the effort to divide the Union territory of J & K A into territorial constituencies was illegal and uncalled for; (d) Though the petitioners may not have challenged the validity of Section 62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act, the same is violative of clause (3) of Article 170 of the Constitution and therefore, the provisions of Section 62 cannot be B implemented. He submitted that the number of Constituencies in Legislative Assemblies of the State can be readjusted only in accordance with Article 170 and in particular, the 2nd proviso to clause (3) thereof, and therefore, any attempt to make any readjustment of the constituencies C of the Union Territory of J & K violates Article 170. The constitution of the Legislative Assembly of the Union Territory of J & K must remain the same till the figures of the first census conducted after the year 2026 are made available; D (e) In view of Articles 82 and 83, constituencies of the House of the People for the Union territory of J & K cannot be reconstituted without the publication of the results of the first census conducted after the year 2026; (f) The opinion rendered by the learned Attorney General for India on 6th July 2016 concerning the implementation of E Section 26 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 (for short, ‘the 2014 Act’) is very relevant.
