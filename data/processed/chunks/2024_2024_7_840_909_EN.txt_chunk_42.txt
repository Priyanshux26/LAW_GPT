102. The negative aspect of competence-competence is aimed at restricting the interference of the courts at the referral stage by preventing the courts from examining the issues pertaining to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal before the arbitral tribunal itself has had the opportunity to entertain them. The courts are allowed to review the decision of the arbitral tribunal at a later stage. 103. The principle of negative competence-competence has also been codified by the national statutory frameworks for international arbitration. For example, in French New Code of Civil Procedure, 1981 and the French Decree No. 2011- 48 of 13 January 2011 Reforming the Law Governing Arbitration, the concept of negative competence-competence was codified based on the decision of Court of Appeal in Colmar Impex v. PAZ, reported in 1968 Rev. Arb. 149, 155 (Colmar Cour d’Appeal). In the said decision, it was observed that, “the principle is that the judge hearing a dispute has jurisdiction to determine his own jurisdiction. This necessarily implies that when that judge is an arbitrator, whose powers derive from the agreement of the parties, he has jurisdiction to examine the existence and validity of such agreement.” 104. Supreme Court of the United States too has, on a number of occasions, consistently affirmed that by virtue of the separability presumption, where there is only a challenge to the validity or legality of the underlying contract, and no challenge to the existence, validity, or legality of the associated arbitration clause itself, the claims should be referred to arbitration. [See: Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Manufacturing Co. reported in 388 U.S. 395 (U.S. S.Ct. 1967); Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna reported in 546 U.S. 440 (U.S. S.Ct. 2006)] 105. In the specific context of settlement of original contract, Gary Born3 writes that “US lower courts have repeatedly applied the separability presumption in holding that claims regarding the validity or 3 Gary B. Born, Internation Commercial Arbitration, 3rd Ed. (2021), pp. 1251 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 901 SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Krish Spinning enforceability of the underlying contract do not impeach the separable arbitration clause and for decisions by the arbitrators.” Referring to the cases in which the aforesaid principles have been applied, he writes “that approach has been opted in diverse settings including in the case of Ambulance Biling Sys., Inc. v. Gemini Ambulance Servs., Inc., 103 S.W.3d 507, 514-515 (Tex. App. 2003) wherein arbitrators were given the power to decide regarding whether a settlement agreement was reached replacing or cancelling original agreement.” 106. In Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. reported in 537 U.S. 79, 84 (U.S. S.Ct. 2002), it was observed by the US Supreme Court that “the presumption is that the arbitrator should decide allegation[s] of waiver, delay, or alike defense to arbitrability.” c. Judicial Interference under the Act, 1996 107. The parties have been conferred with the power to decide and agree on the procedure to be adopted for appointing arbitrators. In cases where the agreed upon procedure fails, the courts have been vested with the power to appoint arbitrators upon the request of a party, to resolve the deadlock between the parties in appointing the arbitrators.
