[Paras 268-273] s.6A vis-à-vis Art. 29 Citizenship Act, 1955 – s.6A – Special provisions as to citizenship of persons covered by the Assam Accord – Constitution of India – Art. 29 – s.6A vis-à-vis Art. 29 – s.6A, if violative of the rights provided to 'indigenous' communities u/Art. 29: Held: (per Surya Kant, J.) (for himself and for M.M. Sundresh and Manoj Misra, JJ.) s.6A cannot be held to be violative of Art. 29 – Petitioners’ failed to show either an actionable impact on Assamese culture, or trace the cause of it to s.6A – On the contrary, s.6A mandates timely detection and deportation of illegal immigrants, a large portion of whom entered Assam post-1971 – It is the non-implementation of the statutory regime which is the cause of the petitioners’ concerns; their attack on the constitutionality of s.6A is misplaced – Also, s.6A does not compel pre-1971 immigrants to keep residing within the territory of Assam once they have obtained Indian citizenship, given that they would enjoy Art. 19(1)(e) rights like any other citizen of India. [Paras 298, 304] – Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI.) (Concurring) s.6A does not violate Art. 29(1) – Cultural and linguistic interests of the citizens of Assam are protected by constitutional and statutory provisions – Mere presence of different ethnic groups in a State not sufficient to infringe the right guaranteed by Art. 29(1) – Also the petitioners are unable to prove that the ability of the Assamese people to take steps to protect their culture, violated by the provisions of s.6A. [Paras 100-102, 125] – Held (per Pardiwala, J.) (Dissenting) By virtue of Art. 19(1)(e), s.6A does not compel pre-1971 immigrants to keep residing in the territory of Assam once they have obtained citizenship thereunder, said may be true for the immigrants belonging to the pre-1966 stream who 972 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports were conferred citizenship automatically, and thus became citizens of India for all purposes from the date of commencement of s.6A itself, the same does not hold true for the immigrants belonging to the 1966-71 category – In the absence of any temporal limit, within which all immigrants belonging to the 1966-71 category are to be detected, deleted and registered as citizens, the immigrants of this category are tethered to the territory of Assam, so as to satisfy the criteria of “ordinarily resident in Assam” on the date when they eventually happen to get detected. [Para 214] Substance of Art. 29(1) Constitution of India – Art. 29(1) – Protection of interest of minorities – Substance of Art. 29(1): Held: (per Surya Kant, J.) (for himself and for M.M. Sundresh and Manoj Misra, JJ.) Rights conferred by Art. 29(1) require that the State not to take any steps to erode a community’s culture, language or script; and concomitantly accords to such section of citizens the freedom and independence to preserve and conserve their culture, language and script, by themselves – Right u/Art.29(1) does not necessitate the Government to enact specific provisions for its enforcement and also does not altogether restrict the State from enacting regulations.
