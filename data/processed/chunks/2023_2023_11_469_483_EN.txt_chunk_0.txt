Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 439 – Special powers of High Court or Court of Session regarding bail – Grant of bail – Allegation of gang rape of minor girl aged 15 years, threat of making video of rape recorded viral and extortion – Registration of FIR by the complainant- uncle for the minor girl for off ences punishable u/ss. 376D, 384, 506 IPC, s. 3 to 6 of POCSO Act, s. 3(2)(v) of the 1989 Act and s. 66 of the 2000 Act against three accused, one son of the sitting MLA, other an acquaintance and the third one the manager of the hotel where the alleged incident occurred – Grant of bail by the High Court – Justifi cation: Held: Instant case is a heinous one and would be a onslaught on the dignity of the womanhood – Father of the victim was a police constable, far below in the hierarchy of service – One of the accused was the son of a sitting MLA and another accused seems to have criminal antecedents and the third accused was the manager of the Hotel where the alleged incident of gang rape occurred – Reason assigned for 13 month delay in fi ling the complaint was constant threat posed by the accused persons of making the video of rape to go viral, especially being in a domineering position – Fact 469 470 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. of delay prima facie cannot be held against the prosecution – Genuineness of the complaint cannot be viewed with doubt nor it can be held that by itself would be suffi cient ground to enlarge the accused on bail – Prosecutrix made allegations against the concerned accused and it becomes amply clear from the plain reading of the complaint as well as the testimony of the prosecutrix that accused persons had indeed participated in the gang rape – High Court erred in not considering the basic facts while considering the prayer for bail – Court framed charges, prima facie discloses the possibility and reasonable suspicion of the accused prima facie culpability – Impugned granting bail not only bereft of material particulars which would justify grant of bail, but seems that the High Court got swayed on the ground of delay and the video having not been recovered during the course of investigation and gave a complete go by to the allegation made in the FIR and statement recorded as also the testimony of the prosecutrix before the court – Thus, the of the High Court set aside – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.
