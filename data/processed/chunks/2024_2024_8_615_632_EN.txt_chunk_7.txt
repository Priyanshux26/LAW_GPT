I award Rs. 54,84,024/- only.” 8.3 Mr. Saurav Agarwal submitted that the payments became due when the gross amount of work done exceeded Rs.1 crore, therefore the delay was to be accounted for from this date. 626 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The error, he submits is because the High Court relied on chart submitted by the respondents, unlike the Arbitrator and the District judge who relied on appellant’s chart. 8.4 High Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 37 merely recounted the dates on which the bills were raised, and the payments made. Thereafter High Court formulated certain questions, which it felt that the Arbitrator and the District Judge should have answered, but failed to hold any discussion on such questions. In this view of the matter, the High Court proceeded to set aside Award of claim no. 4. The relevant portion of the High Court is as follows:- “The learned Arbitrator proceeded on the basis of the statement submitted by the appellant that there was delay in the payment of these bills. The unpaid running account bills were described as “blocked capital”. He viewed the delay in receiving “this blocked capital” as “loss and damage” to the appellant and granted Rs. 54,84,024/- on that reasoning, as “interest”. The learned Judge upheld this award. It is challenged by the respondent. The respondent relies on Clauses 7, 8 and 9 of the contract by which monthly bills had to be raised by the appellant on the measurement made. These payments against the monthly running account bills were to be treated as advance under Clause 7. Payment could have been made only when the gross amount exceeded Rs. 1 crore. According to the respondent no bill was raised by the appellant. According to the statement of claim of the appellant, the first bill for Rs. 1,32,91,180/- was prepared on 29th August, 2011 and paid on or about 30th August 2011. Similarly, the second was prepared on 7th February, 2012 and paid on 9th February, 2012. The third and fourth bills for Rs. 1,28,23,488/- and Rs. 1,30,90,000/- respectively were prepared on 5th March, 2012 and paid between 30th March, 2012 and 20th June, 2012. The fifth bill for Rs. 3,14,82,214/- was prepared on 6th July, 2012 and paid between 24th July, 2012 and 1st [2024] 8 S.C.R. 627 Pam Developments Private Limited v. The State of West Bengal & Anr. October, 2012. The sixth bill was raised on 5th July, 2012 and paid between 6th July, 2012 and 1st October, 2012. The work was completed on 9th November, 2012. What the learned Arbitrator did not determine were the following: a) Who was responsible for non-preparation of the RA bill within time? b) Which of the RA bill claims of the appellant were to be treated as advance under the above clause of the contract? c) Was any notice under the Interest Act, 1978 issued by the appellant and to what effect? d) For what amount and for which period the claim for interest was being entertained and granted by him?
