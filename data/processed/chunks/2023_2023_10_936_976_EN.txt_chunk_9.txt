The appeal must, therefore be dismissed.” (Emphasis Applied) C 7. Hence, the suit which was instated in 1967 was never adjudicated on merits per se in respect of the claim of tenancy by the Respondents, but on the technical grounds of the bar contained in the UP Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1972 as well as on the ground that the appeal against the Prescribed Authority’s D was time barred. However, the District Judge’s dated 30.07.1976 remained unchallenged and ultimately, after the demise of Manohar Lal, who died issueless, mutation proceedings were initiated in 1978 by the present Respondents on the basis of a family settlement. 8.While the relevant s in the said mutation proceedings have E not been made part of the records produced before us, it is stated that the Tehsildar, Haldwani passed an dated 04.07.1978 in favour of the Respondents. This was later confirmed by another dated 30.08.1978 passed by the concerned SDM directing the Tehsildar, Haldwani to mutate the Suit Land in favour of Respondents in revenue records. Against the of the SDM, the State preferred an appeal F before the Commissioner, Kumaon which was rejected vide dated 07.08.1980 and even the revision application against the same was dismissed on 31.12.1980. It is pertinent to note that during the proceedings, a vernacular copy of the dated 07.08.1980 was produced before us, which we will refer to at a later stage. G 9. In the end, because of the fact that the Respondents were successful in the mutation proceedings, the Pargana Officer, Haldwani passed an dated 30.09.1981 accepting the partition between the concerned Respondents, i.e. between Virendra Kumar and Ravi Kumar, on the basis of family settlement. Meanwhile, s dated 07.08.1980 H and 31.12.1980 were challenged before the Board of Revenue in revision STATE OF UTTARAKHAND AND ANR. v. RAVI KUMAR 949 (DECEASED) THROUGH LRS AND OTHERS [SURYA KANT, J.] proceedings, but the same were dismissed via dated 20.01.1982 A with the following observation – “In fact, the challenge which is raised on behalf of the government, is in respect of ownership of the land and this matter cannot be decided finally in the mutation proceeding. Therefore, the matter should be proceeded in other B competent court.” Thus, the issue of ownership again remained unadjudicated even at this stage. 10.For the ease of analysis, the key events in these proceedings are summarised as follows – C D E F G H 950 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A A.2 THE CANCELLATION OF REVENUE ENTRIES AND RESTRAINT ON SALE OF LAND: CIVIL APPEAL NO 4983 OF 2009 AND CIVIL APPEAL NO 4985 OF 2009 11.The subject matter of these appeals arose from an dated 31.12.1981 passed by the District Collector, Nainital (hereinafter, B ‘Expunction ’)during the pendency of the revision proceedings before the Board of Revenue in the abovementioned mutation proceedings. In the said , the Collector noted that on perusal of the revenue records, it was found that after the initial lease period of thirty years had expired, the Respondents had illegally gotten themselves recorded as ‘Bhumidhar’ of the Suit Land in the revenue records.
