16. Having considered the submissions made on behalf of the appellants and having perused the material on record, we find merit in the appellants’ arguments and believe that it is imperative to look into the limits of the KPSC’s autonomy and its power vis-à-vis the State Government with regard to the selection process and employment in Government services. 17. The primary role of the KPSC is to aid and facilitate the selection process. It functions as an autonomous body within the framework laid down by the Constitution of India, ensuring transparency and merit-based recruitment. However, its autonomy is confined to the conduct of the selection process. Determination of the number of 1156 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports vacancies and the requisition for employees remain the prerogative of the State Government, which is the employer. This fundamental distinction was overlooked by the High Court, leading to an erroneous interpretation of the KPSC’s authority. 18. The Government’s role in notifying vacancies is integral to the recruitment process. It determines workforce requirements based on administrative exigencies and operational needs. The KPSC’s mandate is to conduct the selection process in a manner that aligns with these requisitions. The present case underscores the need for clarity in division of responsibilities between the State Government and the Public Service Commission. 19. The notification issued in 2014 clearly indicated that the vacancies to be filled included those that might arise in future. This stipulation was made considering the extended duration of the selection process and the potential for additional vacancies to emerge over time. By the time the rank list was published in 2020, the administrative landscape had evolved, necessitating filling of more vacancies. 20. The Government, as the employer, is best positioned to assess its workforce requirements. It is neither logical nor equitable for the KPSC to disregard the Government’s directives in this regard. When the Government identifies the need for additional employees and directs the KPSC to expand the rank list to accommodate these vacancies, the KPSC’s refusal amounts to an overreach of its role. This refusal is particularly egregious given the extraordinary circumstances, such as duplication of names in different select lists, which have contributed to the unfilled vacancies. 21. The selection process under the 2014 notification spanned approximately six years, culminating in a rank list published in 2020. The validity of this rank list extended until February 2023. During this period, the Government’s needs evolved, and additional vacancies arose. It is unreasonable for the KPSC to deny the Government’s request to expand the rank list to include these vacancies, particularly when the process remains within the bounds of the original notification. 22. The argument that such an expansion would undermine the autonomy of the KPSC is misplaced. The Government’s request does not interfere with the selection process itself but pertains to the utilization of the rank list to address emergent needs. The KPSC’s refusal to [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1157 Ajith G. Das & Others Etc. v. The State of Kerala & Others comply with this request reflects a narrow and restrictive interpretation of its role, which is not supported by the factual realities of this case.
