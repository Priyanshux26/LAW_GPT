It is submitted that when the legislature in its wisdom amended the definition of “manufacture” contained in Section 2(17) and the “tea blending” came to be excluded C from the definition of “manufacture” and which resulted in withdrawing the exemption, which the appellants were availing prior to 01.08.2001 as manufacturer, being a policy decision, the same is not subject to judicial review. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Directorate of Film Festivals & Ors. Vs. Gaurav Ashwin Jain & D Ors., (2007) 4 SCC 737. 5.8 Making above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeals. 6. Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length. 7. The short question, which is posed for the consideration of this E Court is: “Whether despite Section 2(17) of the West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994 which came to be amended w.e.f. 01.08.2001 vide West Bengal Finance Act, 2001, omitting “tea blending” from the definition of “manufacture”, still the appellants shall be entitled to F the exemption from payment of sales tax? 8. The main submission on behalf of the appellants is that as prior to 01.08.2001, the appellants were availing the benefit of sales tax exemption, the said right could not have been taken away by virtue of amendment to Section 2(17) of the Act, 1994 on the ground of legitimate G expectation as well as by promissory estoppel. Thus, it is the case on behalf of the appellants that as on 01.08.2001, under the Act, 1994, when Section 2(17) of the Act, 1994 came to be amended, the appellants had a “vested right” and therefore, the amendment to Section 2(17) of the Act, 1994 shall not affect such “vested right” of exemption from payment H of sales tax, which the appellants were availing prior to 01.08.2001. M/S. K.B. TEA PRODUCT PVT. LTD. v. COMMERCIAL TAX 837 OFFICER, SILIGURI [M. R. SHAH, J.] 8.1 However, it is required to be noted that this is a case of claiming A exemption from payment of sales tax. As per the settled position of law, nobody can claim the exemption as a matter of right. The exemption is always on the fulfilment of the conditions for availing the exemption and the same can be withdrawn by the State. To grant the exemption and/or to continue and/or withdraw the exemption is always within the domain B of the State Government and it falls within the policy decision and as per the settled position of law, unless withdrawal is found to be so arbitrary, the Court would be reluctant to interfere with such a policy decision. 8.2 In the present case, prior to 2001, as per Section 2(17) of the Act, 1994, the activity of “tea blending” was included in the definition of C “manufacture”. Therefore, being in the activity of “tea blending”, the appellants were entitled to the exemption from payment of sales tax as manufacturers. It cannot be disputed that being the manufacturer in the activity of “tea blending” the appellants would have always been entitled to the exemption from payment of sales tax.
