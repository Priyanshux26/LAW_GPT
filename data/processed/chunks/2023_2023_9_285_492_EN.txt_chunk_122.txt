Even though the key provisions in the Arbitration Act, 1996 are primarily based on the UNCITRAL Model Law, the legislature has G also made significant departures, while amending Section 11 and Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. 39. Next, it would be appropriate to briefly trace the jurisprudential history of Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 for the purpose of this reference. H M/s N. N.

A 2-judge Bench of this Court in ICICI Ltd. v. East Coast Boat Builders & Engineers Ltd41 taking into consideration delays in appointment of arbitrators under Section 11(6), referred the question of jurisdiction of a Section 11 judge to consider arbitrability of a dispute to a three-judge bench. It was noted that in KR Raveendranathan v. State B of Kerala42, another two Judge Bench of this Court had already referred to a larger Bench, a similar question. 41. Thereafter, in Sundaram Finance Ltd. v. NEPC India Ltd43, a 2-judge bench opined that: C “12. …under the 1996 Act, appointment of arbitrator(s) is made as per the provisions of section 11, which does not require the Court to pass a judicial appointing [the] arbitrator(s).” 42.

At that stage it would not be appropriate for the Chief Justice or his nominee to entertain any contentious issue between the parties and decide the same. A bare reading of Sections 13 and 16 of the Act makes it crystal clear that questions G 41 (1998) 9 SCC 728 42 (1996) 10 SCC 35 43 (1999) 2 SCC 479 44 (1999) 8 SCC 572 45 (2000) 7 SCC 201 H 450 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R.
