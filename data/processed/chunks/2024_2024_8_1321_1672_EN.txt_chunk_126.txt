90. His Lordship observed that every step needed to achieve in action actual, equal, partnership for the harijans, alone amounts to social justice. He observed that if this is not done, the solemn undertakings in Articles 14 to 16 read with Articles 46 and 335 may be reduced to a “teasing illusion or promise of unreality”. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1499 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. 91. His Lordship further observed thus: “136. The next hurdle in the appellant’s path relates to Article 16(4). To my mind, this sub-article serves not as an exception but as an emphatic statement, one mode of reconciling the claims of backward people and the opportunity for free competition the forward sections are ordinarily entitled to. In the language of Subba Rao, J. (as he then was), in Devadasan [AIR 1964 SC 179: (1964) 4 SCR 680, 700 : (1965) 2 LLJ 560]. “The expression ‘nothing in this article’ is a legislative device to express its intention in a most emphatic way that the power conferred thereunder is not limited in any way by the main provision but falls outside it. It has not really carved out an exception, but has preserved a power untrammelled by the other provisions of the article.” True, it may be loosely said that Article 16(4) is an exception but, closely examined, it is an illustration of constitutionally sanctified classification. Public services have been a fascination for Indians even in British days, being a symbol of State power and so a special article has been devoted to it. Article 16(4) need not be a saving clause but put in due to the over-anxiety of the draftsman to make matters clear beyond possibility of doubt (see, for instance, CIT v. Shaw Wallace & Co. [59 IA 206: AIR 1932 PC 138] ). 137. “Reservation” based on classification of backward and forward classes, without detriment to administrative standards (as this Court has underscored) is but an application of the principle of equality within a class and grouping based on a rational differentia, the object being advancement of backward classes consistently with efficiency. Article 16(1) and (4) are concordant. This Court has viewed Article 16(4)as an exception to Article 16(1). Does classification based on desperate backwardness render Article 16(4) redundant? No. Reservation confers pro tanto monopoly, but classification grants under 1500 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Article 16(1) ordinarily a lesser of advantage. The former is more rigid, the latter more flexible, although they may overlap sometimes. Article 16(4) covers all backward classes; but to earn the benefit of grouping under Article 16(1) based on Articles 46 and 335 as I have explained, the twin considerations of terrible backwardness of the type harijans endure and maintenance of administrative efficiency must be satisfied.” 92. Referring to the observation of Subba Rao, J. in the case of T. Devadasan vs. Union of India,9 Krishna Iyer, J. observed that Article 16(4) serves not as an exception but as an emphatic statement, one mode of reconciling the claims of backward people and the opportunity for free competition the forward sections are ordinarily entitled to.
