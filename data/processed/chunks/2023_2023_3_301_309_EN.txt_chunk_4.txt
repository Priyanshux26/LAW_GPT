250/- per month was being deposited by him in the Court under Section 30 of the Act. The Judge, Small Cause Court gave a finding that the tenant C was in arrears of rent, holding that the rent was Rs.300/- per month and not Rs.250/- per month which admittedly has never been deposited anywhere, and consequently a decree of eviction and recovery of rent was passed against the tenant. The tenant then filed JSCC Revision before the District Judge, Saharanpur which was dismissed on 31.07.2003 and so was his writ petition, later by the Allahabad High Court on D 17.02.2012. 8. The Allahabad High Court though, has set aside the findings of the Trial Court and the Sessions Court, on the enhanced rent. The High Court held that there was no evidence before the trial Court of any ‘oral agreement’ set up by the landlord, which provided for a periodical increase E of rent from Rs. 250/- per month to Rs. 275/- per month, and then to Rs.300/- per month, and so on. Since the so-called oral agreement between the parties was not proved, it would be deemed that the correct rent between the parties was Rs. 250/- per month, which was being paid by the tenant in the Court under Section 30 of the Act. F 9. The High Court then proceeded to decide the legal position post notice dated 05.04.1995. Section 30 of the Act provides that the deposit may be made in the Court on refusal of the rent by the landlord, but this position only lasts till the landlord expresses his willingness to receive the rent. This willingness to receive the rent has to be seen in his G notice dated 05.04.1995 received on 10.05.1995, by the tenant. The High Court dealt with this aspect and held that once the notice of demand was sent to the tenant by the landlord on 05.04.1995 (received by the appellant on 10.04.1995), demanding a rent at the enhanced rate, then the tenant had no option but to deposit the rent before the landlord, as against depositing it in the Court. He could though deposit the admitted H MAN SINGH v. SHAMIM AHMED (DEAD) THR. LRS 307 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] rent (i.e. Rs.250/-) and not the enhanced rent (Rs.300/-), but the deposit A had to be made to the landlord. 10. This was not done and the defence of the tenant that he continued to deposit the “admitted rent” in the Court will not come to his rescue as once the landlord had expressed his willingness to accept the rent, which was expressed in his notice of demand dated 05.04.1951 B then such a rent was liable to be given to the landlord and not in the Court. We are of the considered view that the reasoning given by the learned Single Judge of Allahabad High Court, which follows a Full Court of the High Court, correctly lays down the law. Section 30 gives an opportunity to the defendant to deposit the admitted rent in C Court, but this arrangement lasts only till the landlord expresses his willingness to receive the rent directly.
