Therefore, we do not fi nd any substance in the contention of the appellants that the tax was sought to be imposed on ‘motor vehicles’ and therefore, the same is outside the legislative competence of the State Legislature for Himachal Pradesh. It is clarifi ed that the tax is on passengers and goods and the same has to be paid by the owners of the motor vehicles whose responsibility it is to pay. Therefore, there is no substance in the argument concerning legislative competence of the State Legislature in enacting the Act of 1955 or the Amendment and Validation Act of 1997. 52 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. Summary of conclusions: 23. In the result we arrive at the following conclusions: i. The Act of 1955, as amended by the Amendment and Validation Act of 1997, is valid. The said Act seeks to impose tax on passengers and goods carried by road in motor vehicles and the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly possessed the legislative competence under Article 246, read with Entry 56 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, to enact the Act of 1955 and the Amendment and Validation Act of 1997. ii. By enacting the Amendment and Validation Act of 1997, the Himachal Pradesh State Legislature has validly removed the basis of the of the Division Bench of the High Court dated 27 March, 1997, inter-alia, by amending the defi nition of the term ‘business’; defi ning the terms ‘fare’, ‘freight’ and ‘road’; deleting the Explanation to Section 3(1); and inserting Section 3 (1A) which brought non-fare paying passengers at par with fare- paying passengers for the purpose of levying tax under the Act. Thus, the Amendment and Validation Act of 1997 is a valid piece of Legislation. iii. The activity of the appellant in providing gratis transportation to its employees, and their children, would be a taxable activity under Section 3(1-A) of the Amendment and Validation Act of 1997. 24. The next question is with regard to the liability of the appellants to pay the tax under the Act of 1955 as amended by the Amendment and Validation Act of 1997. The Act of 1955 was assailed in W.P. (C)No.1733 of 1995 by the appellants herein. The High Court of Himachal Pradesh by dated 27.03.1997 struck down certain provisions of the Act and held that the Act did not apply to the appellants herein. The Special Leave Petition fi led against the said was also dismissed by this Court on 28th July, 1997. Thereafter, the Amendment and Validation Act of 1997 was enacted by the legislature of the State of Himachal Pradesh. The amendments were unsuccessfully challenged by the appellants herein by fi ling writ petitions before the High Court. The impugned s of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh were passed in December 2008 and July, NHPC LTD. v. STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH 53 SECRETARY & ORS.[B. V. NAGARATHNA, J.] 2009. The Special Leave Petitions fi led before this Court were converted to Civil Appeals as leave was granted in them.
