If the assessment is non-speaking, cryptic or perfunctory in nature, it may be difficult to attribute to the assessing officer any opinion on the questions that are raised in the proposed reassessment proceedings. 37. Learned counsel for the respondent has placed before the Court in the convenience compilation the reasons recorded by the assessing officer for initiating reassessment proceedings. The same is extracted as under: Reasons for the belief that income has escaped assessment. As per the last balance sheet of the assessee for AY 1989-90 obtained from the South Indian Bank, the capital of the assessee is as under:- Fixed capital of partners. Rs. 20,50,000/- Investment allowance. Rs. 41,47,873/- [2024] 1 S.C.R. 671 M/S Mangalam Publications, Kottayam v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Kottayam Current a/c of partners. Rs. 44,28,597/- ________________ Total Rs. 1,06,26,470/- ________________ The B/S/P & L a/c for the intervening period is not available. But the balance sheet/P&L a/c for AY 1993-94 shows increase in capital which is as under: Fixed capital of partners. Rs. 20,50,000/- Investment allowance. Rs. 40,02,614/- Current a/c of partners. Rs. 1,65,25,455/- ________________ Total Rs. 2,25,78,069/- ________________ The difference of Rs. 1,19,51,599/- is obviously the profit of the assessee during the AY 1990-91 to 1993-94. The profit of AY 1993-94 as per the accounts is Rs. 5,08,548/-. If this is excluded, the profit for the three years i.e. 1990- 91, 1991-92 and AY 1992-93 is Rs. 1,14,43,051/-. The profit will be more, if the drawings during the period of the partners are included. The drawings and taxes paid is: drawings taxes paid 1990-91 Rs.20,30,584/- Rs.2,48,287/- 1991-92 Rs.18,87,648/- 1992-93 Rs.29,12,038/- Rs.2,72,212/- 1993-94 Rs.68,30,270/- Rs.3,83,925/- (Figures not available from assessment records.) Thus, the profit for the three years would be Rs. 1,86, 57, 246/- (1,14,43,051 + 68,30,270 + 3,83,925). Under assessment of income for the three years is, therefore, Rs.1,69,92,728 i.e., (18657246 – 1664518). The sales estimated by AO for each of the 3 years less depreciation for each year is taken as the basis for determining the proportion in which the under-assessment has been made. 672 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports AY Sales Depreciation Balance Under- estimated Assessment by AO 1990-91 90079199 4329815 85749384 6324989 1991-92 82124877 6222432 75902441 5598817 1992-93 72294757 3575079 68719678 5068892 Total under-assessment 16992728 In view of the above, I have reason to believe that by reason of omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment, income as determined above, chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. 38. Thus, from a reading of the reasons recorded by the assessing officer leading to formation of his belief that income of the assessee had escaped assessment for the assessment years under consideration, it is seen that the only material which came into possession of the assessing officer subsequently was the balance sheet of the assessee for the assessment year 1989-90 obtained from the South Indian Bank. After obtaining this balance sheet, the assessing officer compared the same with the balance sheet and profit loss account of the assessee for the assessment year 1993-94.
