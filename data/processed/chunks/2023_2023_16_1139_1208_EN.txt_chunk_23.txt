The very object of grafting the said two sections with the said clause is to enable the Central Government to issue a notifi cation under section 90 towards implementation of the terms of the DTAs which would automatically override the provisions of the Income Tax Act in the matter of ascertainment of chargeability to income tax and ascertainment of total income, to the extent of inconsistency with the terms of the DTAC. 27. The contention of the respondents, which weighed with the High Court viz. that the impugned circular No. 789 is inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, is a total non-sequitur. As we have pointed 31 [2001] 249 ITR 418 (Cal) 32 [1993]202 ITR 508 (KAR) 33 [1995] 212 ITR 31 (Guj) ASSESSING OFFICER CIRCLE (INTERNATIONAL TAXATION) 2(2)(2) 1171 NEW DELHI v. M/S NESTLE SA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] out, Circular No. 789 is a circular within the meaning of section 90; therefore, it must have the legal consequences contemplated by sub-section (2) of section 90. In other words, the circular shall prevail even if inconsistent with the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 insofar as assessees covered by the provisions of the DTAC are concerned. ****************** **************** 29. In our view, the contention is wholly misconceived. Section 90, as we have already noticed (including its precursor under the 1922 Act), was brought on the statute book precisely to enable the executive to negotiate a DTAC and quickly implement it. Even accepting the contention of the respondents that the powers exercised by the Central Government under section 90 are delegated powers of legislation, we are unable to see as to why a delegate of legislative power in all cases has no power to grant exemption. There are provisions galore in statutes made by Parliament and State legislatures wherein the power of conditional or unconditional exemption from the provisions of the statutes are expressly delegated to the executive. For example, even in fi scal legislation like the Central Excise Act and Sales Tax Act, there are provisions for exemption from the levy of tax. (See Section 5A of Central Excise Act, 1944 and Section 8(5) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956). therefore we are unable to accept the contention that the delegate of a legislative power cannot exercise the power of exemption in a fi scal statute.” 46. The legal position discernible from the previous discussion, therefore is that upon India entering into a treaty or protocol does not result in its automatic enforceability in courts and tribunals; the provisions of such treaties and protocols do not therefore, confer rights upon parties, till such time, as appropriate notifi cations are issued, in terms of Section 90(1). 47.
