However, not all States have adopted this three-pronged strategy. States such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Bihar showcase strong alignment with this multifaceted approach. For instance, the financial incentive schemes in Telangana and Bihar effectively incentivize families to delay marriage. States like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh focus on training and awareness. The absence of direct financial support could limit their schemes’ impact on economically vulnerable communities. While these efforts contribute to raising awareness and promoting societal change, families facing financial hardships may still lean toward early marriage without economic support for educational or vocational opportunities. The absence of direct financial assistance may limit the reach and impact of otherwise well-designed training and awareness programs, as families in economically challenged communities may not feel the immediate benefits of delaying marriage without addressing financial constraints. 113. The data on child marriages across various States and UTs shows a range of outcomes in both prevention and prosecution efforts over the last three years. Several states, such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and West Bengal, report a high number of cases, though many of these cases were prevented before the marriages could be solemnized. Karnataka documented 8,348 child marriage cases, preventing 7,306 of these, while Andhra Pradesh reported 3,413 cases, with 3,136 successfully prevented. This reflects a proactive approach to preventing child marriages in some states, where authorities intercept and prevent a significant portion of cases before, they are formalized. 114. Some States illustrate discrepancies between the number of child marriage cases reported, the number prevented, and the number of FIRs filed. Maharashtra reported 2043 cases prevented but registered 178 FIRs, suggesting limited legal follow-through. Similarly, Telangana reported 4440 cases of child marriage, of [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1579 Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. which only 149 FIRs were filed. Andhra Pradesh, despite having 3,416 cases registered, filed 10 FIRs. These gaps highlight potential obstacles in prosecution and a possible need for streamlined cooperation between child marriage prevention authorities and law enforcement agencies. Tamil Nadu presents a more comprehensive approach, where both prevention and FIR filing are high; with 8,966 reported cases, the state successfully prevented 6,436 marriages and filed 2,392 FIRs. 115. Interestingly, several States and UTs, such as Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland, reported no cases of child marriage over the last three years. While this might indicate minimal occurrences of child marriage in these areas, it could also suggest underreporting or a lack of awareness of the issue among authorities and communities. Furthermore, States and UTs like Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh and Puducherry, which reported very low figures or none at all, raise questions about the consistency and accuracy of data reporting processes. 116. A more comprehensive look across all regions also includes variations in the effectiveness of interventions. In addition, the number of cases leading to FIRs is relatively low across most states compared to the number of marriages reported, highlighting potential gaps in legal action and prosecution efforts. Even in states with high intervention rates, the limited legal action suggests that additional support may be needed to ensure accountability and deterrence.
