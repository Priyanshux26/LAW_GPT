Insights from the evolution of the legal framework 63. In essence, after a series of deliberations by the legislature, the executive and nudges by this Court, the framework created by Rule 8 of the NCLT Rules and Section 12A of the IBC read with Rule 30A of the CIRP Regulations lays down an exhaustive procedure for the withdrawal of an application filed by creditors under Sections 7, 9, or 10 of the IBC. Withdrawal may be sought at four stages, all of which have a procedure prescribed under the existing framework. These may be summarized as follows: i. Before the application under Sections 7, 9 or 10 is admitted by the NCLT: Such cases are squarely covered by Rule 8 of the NCLT Rules, which requires that the applicant approach the NCLT directly. The NCLT may then pass an permitting the withdrawal of the application. At this stage, as the CIRP process has not been initiated, the proceedings are still in personam, as between the applicant creditor and the corporate debtor. Therefore, while approving the withdrawal at this stage, the NCLT may restrict its enquiry to only hear the applicant creditor and corporate debtor, and other potential creditors are not stakeholders at this stage.
