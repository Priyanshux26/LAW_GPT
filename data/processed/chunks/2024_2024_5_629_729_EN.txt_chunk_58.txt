Thereafter, the charges were framed and explained to the accused through the virtual mode. On the very same date, an was passed for summoning the prosecution witnesses. Strangely enough, an application was filed by the Investigating Officer to record the evidence of four witnesses in a single day, as a confidential information obtained, indicated that there was pressure from the family members of the accused. No notice was served either on the accused or his counsel, and the was apparently passed, without taking into consideration the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018. In disregard of the provisions of the Rules for Video Conferencing for Courts, 2020, the statements of the witnesses were recorded. 47. After two days i.e. 24.01.2022, the remaining witnesses, including the Investigating Officer, were examined. There was no material to show that the accused was present at that point of time. The plea made by the counsel for the defence for deferment by one week was rejected, sans any substantial reason. For the purpose of questioning under Section 313 of the CrPC, 1973 alone, the accused was brought through video conferencing. In a hurried manner, the questioning was done. The repeated plea of adjournment by one week made by the counsel for the defence was once again rejected, while ultimately facilitating a day’s adjournment. 48. On the next day i.e. 25.01.2022, an application was filed by the defence praying for time for production of witnesses. The matter was passed over, with a direction to produce the witnesses on that day itself. Arguments were heard, during which time, the prosecution made submissions for 10 minutes, whereas the defence argued for 3 726 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports hours. It was accordingly concluded at 6.30 p.m. The was delivered at about 7.00 pm, running into about 27 pages consisting of 59 paragraphs. It is not known as to how the copies of the witnesses statements were made ready and kept for perusal. Admittedly, even the counsel for the defence did not have those copies. 49. Two days thereafter i.e. 27.01.2022, the case was posted for sentencing. Upon hearing the accused, death sentence was imposed by the trial court. The High Court, by the impugned , called for the records and went through them thoroughly, finding that there is non-compliance of Sections 207, 226, 227 and 230 of the CrPC, 1973, set aside the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial Court, and ed for a de novo trial. Incidentally, the approach adopted by the Trial Court was found fault with. 50. Assailing the impugned on merit, the informant has filed Criminal Appeal No. 3924 of 2023. Aggrieved over the observations made by the High Court, the learned Trial Judge has filed Criminal Appeal Nos. 3926-3927 of 2023. Criminal Appeal No. 3925 of 2023 51. Criminal Appeal No. 3925 of 2023 has been filed by the very same learned Judge who rendered a similar conviction and sentenced the accused to life imprisonment for remainder of natural life, without any remission, against the observations made by a Coordinate Bench of the High Court, which took note of the earlier rendered by the Coordinate Bench.
