This would have an adverse effect on export of organic food as importers would closely examine the conditions under which organic food is being grown and any concerns about contamination could lead to an adverse impact and loss of markets for organic food producers; (iii) that India is a signatory to the CPB, therefore, a duty is cast on the Government to assess the impact of its policies and minimize adverse impacts of the same vide Article 26 thereof. 2098 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (iv) that the 1989 Rules were framed prior to the coming into force of the CPB but there is a distinct inconsistency between the same and therefore, the 1989 Rules should be amended in line with the said protocol, otherwise, international law could be applied as part of the national law, unless it is in conflict with any Act of Parliament. (v) In sum and substance, it was contended that there is a need for putting in place a suitable policy and an effective regulatory mechanism which would work within the framework of its mandate. 41.3 Per contra, the Union of India urged this Court to not intervene in the matter as the questions involved are highly technical and polycentric in character. This proposition is indeed attractive at a first blush, for it invites the Court to trust the process of the grant of approval for the environmental release of GMOs under the applicable legal regime. But, it is settled law that expert opinion is not beyond the pale of judicial review, especially when there are serious infirmities in the decision-making process, vide Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India vs. Council of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, (2007) 12 SCC 210 (“Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India”). 41.4 In the above backdrop, the points for consideration shall be answered. Re: Point No.1: Whether GEAC approval dated 18.10.2022 and the consequent decision dated 25.10.2022 for the environmental release of DMH-11 is in accordance with law? 42. I have adverted to in detail several meetings of GEAC held with regard to the application submitted by the applicant, namely, CGMCP, University of Delhi (South Campus) on 15.09.2015 seeking approval for environmental release of the GE mustard hybrid DMH-11. This was after conclusion of the closed or confined trials and was accompanied with a dossier of 3285 pages compiling the results of the food and environmental safety studies that were carried out at the time of the confined trials for the environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, parental lines bn 3.6 and modbs 2.99 containing barnase, barstar and bar genes. In the 125th [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2099 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. meeting held on 11.12.2015, GEAC requested the applicant to give a presentation and thereafter on 04.01.2016, a sub-committee was constituted for examination of the dossier. 42.1 The sub-committee held two meetings. After the first meeting, it recommended revision of the biosafety dossier by incorporating additional information regarding certain lacunae or gaps which it had identified and were also identified by the BSU.
