A more compendious examination of the issue was considered by another Seven-Judge Bench in Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay North, Ahmedabad11 wherein it was observed that frequent exercise by this Court of its power to review its earlier decisions on the ground that the view placed before it later appeared to the Court to be more reasonable, may incidentally tend to make law uncertain and introduce confusion which must be consistently avoided.

Davinder Singh & Ors. jolt to the legal system when you overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in promoting stability and even-handedness”. [Congressional Record—Senate, Vol. 156, Pt. 7, 10018 (7-6-2010).] “18. Doctrines of precedents and stare decisis are the core values of our legal system.
