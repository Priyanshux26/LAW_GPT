till the date of institution of the suit. It was submitted that no particulars have been set forth in the plaint as to how this amount of Rs.23,96,000/- (Rupees Twenty Three Lakhs Ninety Six Thousand) was arrived at. While the cause of action pleaded in the suit makes reference only to the Agreement, the appellant makes a claim in respect of the mortgages dated 16.03.1995 and 17.04.1995, while also reserving the right to take separate action. Thus, it was submitted that the appellant has not put forth any specific case but has attempted to intermingle the mortgages and/or promissory notes with the Agreement. It was submitted that the mortgages dated 16.03.1995 and 17.04.1995 as also the promissory notes have been merged to arrive at the figure of Rs.11,00,000/- (Rupees Eleven Lakhs), which is being claimed as due from the respondent. It was further submitted that the promissory notes have not been exhibited in the suit. 19. Learned Senior counsel also pointed out that in respect of the two mortgages dated 16.03.1995 and 17.04.1995, the High Court in Second Appeal6 No.1235 of 2014 (which emanated from a suit for redemption filed by the respondent) passed an interim 6 Hereinafter abbreviated to “SA”. 1010 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports dated 25.08.2022, directing the respondent to pay the appellant a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakhs), being the principal and interest on both the mortgages. Subsequently, the High Court, by way of its final dated 24.01.2023 in the said SA, noted the payments made by the respondent to the appellant, the return of the original Mortgage Deeds and also the cancellation of the mortgages. Thus, as the decree in the redemption suit had been complied with, it dismissed the second appeal as having become infructuous. Payment had been made and, after receiving the same, the appellant had returned the original title deeds to the respondent in respect of the property which was the subject-matter of the two mortgages dated 16.03.1995 and 17.04.1995. 20. It was further submitted that in the criminal case filed by the appellant against the respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, this Court dismissed Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No.994 of 2019,7 confirming the acquittal of the respondent. As regards the Second Impugned , it was submitted that the facts recorded therein speak for themselves and the appellant did not deserve any indulgence. Based on the above pleas, the respondent has sought dismissal of the instant appeals. ANALYSIS, REASONING & CONCLUSION: 21. Having given our anxious thought to the lis, we find that the s impugned need interference. 22. In our view, the Single Judge had appreciated the bundle of facts in the correct perspective, that is, the respondent had, by way of the Agreement, created a mortgage by deposit of title deeds. There was no redemption of this mortgage. The Division Bench fell in error in concluding that “The plaint averments are self-contradictory, vague and does not make out a clear case of mortgage.” (sic).
