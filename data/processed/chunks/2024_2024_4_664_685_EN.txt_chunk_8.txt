If any authority is needed in support of the proposition, it is to be found in West U.P. Sugar Mills Assn. v. State of U.P13., State of Rajasthan v. Mangilal Pindwal14 , Koteswar Vittal Kamath v. K. Rangappa Baliga and Co.15 and A.L.V.R.S.T. Veerappa Chettiar v. I.S. Michael16 . In West U.P. Sugar Mills Assn.17 case a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that the State Government by substituting the new rule in place of the old one never intended to keep alive the old rule. Having regard to the totality of the circumstances centring around the issue the Court held that the substitution had the effect of just deleting the old rule and making the new rule operative. In Mangilal Pindwal18 case this Court upheld the legislative practice of an amendment by substitution being incorporated in the text of a statute which had ceased to exist and held that the substitution would have the effect of amending the operation of law during the period in which it was in force. In Koteswar case19 a three-Judge Bench of this Court emphasised the distinction between 12 [2004] Supp. 5 SCR 272 : (2004) 8 SCC 1 13 [2002] 1 SCR 897 : (2002) 2 SCC 645 14 [1996] Supp. 3 SCR 98 : (1996) 5 SCC 60 15 [1969] 3 SCR 40 : (1969) 1 SCC 255 16 1963 Supp (2) SCR 244 17 [2002] 1 SCR 897 : (2002) 2 SCC 645 18 (1996) 5 SCC 60 19 (1969) 1 SCC 255 676 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “supersession” of a rule and “substitution” of a rule and held that the process of substitution consists of two steps: first, the old rule is made to cease to exist and, next, the new rule is brought into existence in its place.” 12.2 A slight variation is noticed in a recent decision in Gottumukkala Venkata Krishamraju v. Union of India,20 where this Court held that: “18. Ordinarily wherever the word “substitute” or “substitution” is used by the legislature, it has the effect of deleting the old provision and make the new provision operative. The process of substitution consists of two steps : first, the old rule is made to cease to exist and, next, the new rule is brought into existence in its place. The rule is that when a subsequent Act amends an earlier one in such a way as to incorporate itself, or a part of itself, into the earlier, then the earlier Act must thereafter be read and construed as if the altered words had been written into the earlier Act with pen and ink and the old words scored out so that thereafter there is no need to refer to the amending Act at all. No doubt, in certain situations, the Court having regard to the purport and object sought to be achieved by the legislature may construe the word “substitution” as an “amendment” having a prospective effect. Therefore, we do not think that it is a universal rule that the word “substitution” necessarily or always connotes two severable steps, that is to say, one of repeal and another of a fresh enactment even if it implies two steps.
