Pattabhi Ram, Anmol Chandan, Prahlad Singh, Ms. Nidhi Khanna, Ms. Poornima Singh, Ashwin Joseph, Dr. N. Visakamurthy, Mukesh Kumar Maroria, Advs. for the Respondents. / of the Supreme Court Pankaj Mithal, J. 1. Learned counsel for the parties were heard. 2. Instructions were issued from time to time with regard to enrollment into Army under the Unit Headquarters Quota (UHQ). The instructions as revised upto the year 1978, provided that Regiments/Corps have sanction to enroll 15 per cent of the total yearly demand released by the Additional Directorate of Recruiting to Zonal Recruiting Offices. This percentage was increased to 25 during the year 1981-82 and in March, 1983 this quota was further increased to 50 per cent. Since the Regiments/Corps could not fill up such large number of vacancies, to facilitate the enrollment, priority was provided to certain categories of personnel which included sons and grandsons of servicemen and ex-servicemen; brothers and other near relatives of those killed in battle or died in service; wards who were fully dependent upon servicemen or ex-servicemen; sportsmen of merit, and those for whom there was a special recruitment, e.g., Ladakh Scouts, Cavalry, Gorkha, Para, President Body Guard Regiments etc. It was further provided that Unit Headquarters Quota Enrollment shall give priority to the above categories and in case vacancies for recruitment remain available with Regimental Centre, personnel from open category based on merit may be taken. 3. In the light of the above instructions for recruitment under the Unit Headquarters, a news item was published for the purposes of recruitment inviting applications under the Unit Headquarters Quota. It appears that a large number of candidates including the appellants applied. The appellants were selected and were enrolled in the Army by the Maratha Light Infantry Regimental Centre (‘MLIRC’). After they [2024] 2 S.C.R. 245 No.2809759H Ex-Recruit Babanna Machched v. Union of India and Ors. had put in nearly three years of service, a show cause notice was issued to several of them alleging that they had obtained enrollment in the Army either on the basis of the fake sports person certificate or on the basis of false relationship certificate. On consideration of the reply of those persons, the services of about 52 of them were terminated. However, after some litigation, candidates belonging to the category of sportsmen of merit, were all reinstated.
