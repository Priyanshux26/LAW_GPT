The NCSK vide reply dated 12.4.2023 stated that the fi gures of total number of manual scavengers identifi ed vide National Survey 2018 conducted by NSKFDC varies with the progress of the survey mainly due to variations in the number of states and districts surveyed. The apparent discrepancy in data for 24.07.2021 and 08.12.2021 is a result of ongoing identifi cation and subsequent verifi cation processes.19 33. Furthermore, there is no inconsistency in the information provided by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to the Parliament. On December 1, 2021, in response to Unstarred Question No. 450 in the Rajya Sabha, it was conveyed that a total of 58,098 manual scavengers were identifi ed through surveys conducted in accordance with the Act of 2013. Subsequently, in reply to another Rajya Sabha Unstarred Question no. 1254 dated 8.12.2021; the Government reiterated the same number of identifi ed manual scavengers. The Government informed Parliament that there were no reports of individuals currently engaged in manual scavenging across the country and that there were no reported deaths attributed to manual scavenging. However, it was clarifi ed that during the last fi ve years, 321 individuals had lost their lives in accidents while undertaking hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. In response to Unstarred Question no. 3822 in the Lok Sabha dated 21.12.2021, the Government once again stated that there were no reports of individuals currently engaged in manual scavenging in the country. The number of manual scavengers identifi ed at diff erent times does not necessarily represent the current number of individuals engaged in manual scavenging as many people have left the work of manual scavenging due to various eff orts of Govt. and provisions of Act of 2013.20 34. It was further argued that the identifi cation of manual scavengers was primarily for the purpose of extending rehabilitation benefits in accordance with the scheme. It should not be misconstrued to mean that the increase in the number of identifi ed individuals indicates a rise in active manual scavenging activities.21 19 Union of India’s Note dt.26.07.2023 (Vol. 5) 20 Union of India’s Note dt.26.07.2023 (Vol. 5) 21 Union of India’s Note dt.26.07.2023 (Vol. 5) DR. BALRAM SINGH v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 1103 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 35. In response to the suggestions made by the Amicus, the Union argued against the need to establish a Task Force under the CMC as the government had formulated a Scheme of National Action for Mechanize Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE)22 which proposes to create three tier working committees (working committee, state monitoring committee and district/urban local body-level committee). These committees will meet quarterly to oversee the implementation of NAMASTE. Therefore, it was submitted that there is no requirement for a separate Task Force.23 36. Concerning the NCSK, the Union stated that the Chairman, Vice Chairman, and one member have been appointed on 03.03.2023, for a term till 31.03.2025.
