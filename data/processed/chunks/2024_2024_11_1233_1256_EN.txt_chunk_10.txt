No doubt, evidence about extension of death threat in a public meet of the Gram Sabha, held in January 1997, has come, but, admittedly, no such incident was reported to the police. Hence, motive proved is not such as may have a material bearing on the prosecution case. Otherwise also, motive on its own cannot make or break the prosecution case. LAST SEEN CIRCUMSTANCE 26. The circumstance of deceased being last seen alive in the company of the deceased is a vital link in the chain of other circumstances but on its own strength it is insufficient to sustain conviction unless the time-gap between the deceased being last seen alive with the accused and recovery of dead body of the deceased is so small that possibility of any other person being the author of the crime is just about impossible. Where the time-gap is large, intervening circumstances including act by some third person cannot be ruled out.10 In such a case, adverse inference cannot be drawn against the accused merely because he has failed to prove as to when he parted company of the deceased. 27. In the instant case, PW-4 allegedly saw the deceased walking on a street with accused-appellant no.1 on 2.2.1997, at about 4.30 PM, near Gadhera Degree College. PW-4 further stated that accused- appellant no.2 was walking 50-55 paces behind them. No evidence was led by the prosecution to demonstrate that the place where the deceased was last seen alive with the accused was near the place 10 See Nizam v. State of Rajasthan (2016) 1 SCC 550; Navaneethakrishnan v. State (2018) 16 SCC 161; Kanhaiya Lal v. State of Rajasthan (2014) 4 SCC 715; State of U.P. v. Satish (2005) 3 SCC 114; Ramreddy Rajesh Khanna Reddy & Anr. V. State of A.P. (2006) 10 SCC 172; and Bodhraj v. State of J & K (2002) 8 SCC 45 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1249 Suresh Chandra Tiwari & Anr. v. State of Uttarakhand from where deceased’s body was recovered. Further, the time gap between 4.30 PM of 2.2.1997 and 8.30 AM of 3.2.1997 (i.e., when the dead body was recovered) is so large that third party hand in the crime cannot be ruled out. Otherwise also, if two or more persons are seen walking on a public street, either side by side, or behind one another, it is not such a circumstance from which it may be inferred with a degree of certainty that those were together or in company of each other. Quite often on a public path a person may happen to walk side by side a stranger for a considerable distance without even talking to him. Likewise, a person may exchange pleasantries with another person walking on the path, but that by itself is not sufficient to infer that the two are in company of each other. Importantly, the prosecution case is not that the deceased was picked up from his house by the accused-appellant(s). Had it been so, in absence of evidence as to when they parted company of each other, adverse inference against the accused might be permissible, if the other circumstances so warrant.
