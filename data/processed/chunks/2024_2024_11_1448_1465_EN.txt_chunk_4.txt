Accused No.1 has not assailed any . REASONING OF THE COURT BELOW 13. The High Court vide the impugned , after considering the contentions of the parties, gave the following findings while allowing the petitions: i. The release of article Mo2 (Jetty) from the custody of the Court, followed by its return after being altered, would be considered an act of criminal conspiracy under Section 120B, IPC and will also constitute an offence under Section 193, IPC. As the said article was released from the custody of the Court, and at that time, the same was unquestionably under ‘Custodiam Legis’, and therefore, the bar u/s 195(1)(b) would get attracted. ii. The cognizance taken on the final report was not legally sustainable, as it contravened the legal requirements under Section 195 (1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Court categorically distinguished the decision of this Court in [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1455 M.R. Ajayan v. State of Kerala & Ors. CBI v. M. Sivamani 3 (2-Judge Bench) on the point that the procedural distinctions between judicial and administrative s are underscored by this case, where the CB-CID had initiated the investigation based on a judicial issued by the Madras High Court, rather than an administrative , as in the present case. ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION 14. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have also perused the written submissions filed. The issues which arise for consideration of this Court are: i. Whether M.R. Ajayan, appellant in SLP(Crl. )No.4887 of 2024 has the locus standi to prefer this SLP against the impugned ? ii. Whether the High Court has rightly held the proceedings in question to be hit by the bar under Section 195(1)(b) Cr.P.C.? iii. Independent of the above, whether the High Court could have ed de novo steps to be taken against the appellant? DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 15. Coming to the first issue at hand, concerning the locus standi of Mr. M.R. Ajayan, the appellant in SLP(Crl. )No.4887 of 2024, he has submitted that he is a socially spirited person and editor of “Green Kerela News”. He had also filed an intervention application before the High Court of Kerala, resisting the quashing petition. 16. Antony Raju, Respondent No.2 in SLP(Crl. )No.4887 of 2024/ appellant in the appeal arising out SLP(Crl. )No.7896 of 2023, has objected to the locus of Mr. M.R. Ajayan, submitting that third parties cannot be permitted to prefer appeal in criminal proceedings and has sought to place reliance on s of this Court in P.S.R. Sadhanantham v. Arunachalam & Anr. (5-Judge Bench),4 National Commission for Women v. State of Delhi & Anr. (2-Judge Bench)5 and Amanuallah & Anr. v. State of Bihar & Ors.
