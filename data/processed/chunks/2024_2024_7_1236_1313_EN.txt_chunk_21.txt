On the other hand, equivalent non-compliance of an passed under Section 125 of CrPC 1973 may result in imprisonment for a term of one month or until the payment is made. 24. After the advent of the decision in Danial Latifi (supra), numerous High Courts also went on to contemplate and analyse the instant question of law. A quick examination of the said by various High Courts allows us to categorise the decisions rendered therein into two sets of views. The first view in certain s so rendered held that the remedy is to be exclusively exercised under Section 3 of the 1986 Act, impliedly holding that the rights under the secular provisions stood extinguished. Another view in certain other s allowed a divorced Muslim woman to seek the remedy of maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC 1973 while explicit existence of Section 3 of the 1986 Act was recognised. 25. The set of s, that went on to hold that the rights of a divorced Muslim woman are to be exercised through the provisions of the 1986 Act and specifically under Section 3 therein, and, not through the secular provision of Section 125 of CrPC 1973. One decision by a Single Judge of the High Court of Allahabad in Shahid Jamal Ansari v. State of Uttar Pradesh 2008 SCC OnLine All 1077 is brought to our attention by the learned amicus curiae whereby the Court opined that a divorced Muslim woman cannot claim maintenance from her former husband by virtue of secular provision of Section 125 of CrPC 1973 and the 1986 Act, being a complete code in itself on the subject matter of maintenance, prevails. 26. Deviating from the aforesaid approach, certain High Courts adopted a beneficial interpretation, that is to say, that the non-obstante clause in the 1986 Act, in no manner bars the remedy under Section 125 CrPC 1973. In this regard, a reference has been made to a decision of Single Judge of High Court of Gujarat in Mumtazben Jusabbhai Sipahi v. Mahebubkhan Usmankhan Pathan 1998 SCC OnLine Guj 279, a decision of High Court of Kerala in Kunhimohammed v. Ayishakutty 2010 SCC OnLine Ker 567, the decisions of High Court 1266 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of Allahabad in Mrs. Humera Khatoon and Others v. Mohd. Yaqoob 2010 SCC OnLine All 202, Sazid v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others 2011 SC OnLine All 1059, Jubair Ahmad v. Ishrat Bano 2019 SCC OnLine All 4065, and Shakila Khatun v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another 2023 SCC OnLine All 75, and the decision of a Single Judge of High Court of Bombay in Khalil Abbas Fakir v. Tabbasum Khalil Fakir and Another 2024 SCC OnLine Bom 23. 27. Amongst these set of decisions, the one rendered by a Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala in Kunhimohammed (supra) has significantly occupied the field in regard to the limited question of law before us. A perusal of the instant showcases the same to be in line with the ratio decidendi rendered by this Court in the decision in Danial Latifi (supra) by holding that there is no express extinguishment of the rights under Section 125 CrPC 1973 and neither the same was intended or conceived by the legislature while enacting the 1986 Act.
