This Court was dealing with monetary liability. (34) Though the appellant’s final decision to take action as he did G by proceedings dated 24.12.1979, stood in contrast with the contents of his counter affidavit, it by itself may not obviate the need for sanction, even proceeding on the basis that the appellant could be accused of the offences which view found favour with the Magistrate. The upshot of the above discussion is that we find that the Magistrate erred in the facts of this case in taking cognizance against H 694 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A the appellant contrary to the mandate of Section 197 of the Cr.P.C. On that short ground alone, the appellant succeeds. The appeal is allowed. The impugned will stand set aside. The proceedings challenged in Section 482 will stand quashed. We, however, make it clear that this will not stand in the way of the competent authority taking a decision in the matter and/ or granting sanction for prosecuting the appellant in B accordance with law. In view of the fact that the appellant succeeds on the aspect of there being no sanction, we do not deem it necessary to pronounce on the two other contentions which have been pressed before us by the appellant.
