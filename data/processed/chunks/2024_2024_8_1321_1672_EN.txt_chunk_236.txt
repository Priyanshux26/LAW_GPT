It was also observed that “creamy layer” is to be excluded otherwise it will be discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 16 as “forwards” and “creamy layer of backward classes” cannot be treated unequally. 31. In M. Nagaraj vs. Union of India,11 the validity of the constitutional amendments namely Constitution (Seventy-Seventh Amendment) Act, 1995, Constitution (Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000, Constitution (Eighty-second Amendment) Act, 2000 and Constitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2002, were upheld. 32. In TMA Pai Foundation vs. State of Karnataka,12 the 11 Judges Constitution Bench of this Court laid down various principles regarding right to establish educational institutions, the procedure for grant of admission, the right of minorities and the extent of State regulatory mechanism. The said came to be interpreted and clarified by Islamic Academia Education vs. State of Karnataka.13 In P.A. Inamdar vs. State of Maharashtra,14 the 7 Judges Constitution Bench held that the 5 Judges Constitution Bench in Islamic Academia Education case did not interpret the TMA Pai Foundation case correctly. In such a situation, Constitution (Ninety-Third Amendment) Act, 2006, was brought about to overcome the confusion alleged 9 [1995] Supp. 3 SCR 269 : (1995) 5 SCC 403 10 [1999] Supp. 5 SCR 229 : (2000) 1 SCC 168 11 (2006) 8 SCC 212 12 [2002] Supp. 3 SCR 587 : (2002) 8 SCC 481 13 [2003] Supp. 2 SCR 474 : (2003) 6 SCC 697 14 (2005) 6 SCC 537 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1653 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. to have been created in the interpretation of TMA Pai Foundation case and Sub-Article (5) was inserted in Article 15 of the Constitution which reads as under: “Article 15 (5)- Nothing in this article or in sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of article 19 shall prevent the State from making any special provision, by law, for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes in so far as such special provisions relate to their admission to educational institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of article 30.” 33. The validity of the Constitution (Ninety-Third Amendment) Act, 2006, was upheld by the 5 Judges Constitution Bench in Ashok Kumar Thakur case (supra) which provided reservation for socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in educational institutions insofar as it relates to State maintained institutions and Government aided educational institutions. 34. A similar view was expressed in Pramati Educational & Cultural Trust vs. Union of India,15 wherein also the constitutional validity of the Constitution (Ninety-Third Amendment) Act, 2006, was upheld and reservation for socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in unaided private institutions as well was upheld. 35. In Ram Singh vs. Union of India,16 reservation for Jats in various States was struck down as no such reservation in their favour was recommended by the National Commission for Backward Classes and there was no quantifiable data for justifying reservation in their favour.
