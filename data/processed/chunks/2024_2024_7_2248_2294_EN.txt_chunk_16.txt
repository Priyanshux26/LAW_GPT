If the site to the extent it is within the 15 meters of the defined boundary of water course, that part alone could be said to have no potential for development. The land beyond the [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2269 Kazi Akiloddin v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. 15 meters mark from the defined boundary of the water course in the site of the appellant should be treated independently and as to what would be the value thereof, we shall discuss herein below. For the land up to 15 meters (in the event of the site or part of the site falling within 15 meters of the defined boundary of the water course) shall be paid the amount as determined by the Land Acquisition Officer in the award dated 04.08.2000. 46. Now that we have concluded that the land of the appellant except to the extent of 15 meters from the defined boundary of the water course is not covered by the no construction zone, the question arises as to what should be the market value payable as on 03.06.1999. As has been narrated earlier, the LAO in his Award (Exh. 46) awarded an amount of Rs.5,61,000/- per hectare for the entire extent of 1,25, 937 sq. ft. which works out to Rs. 5/- per sq. ft. The Land Acquisition Officer relied on a sale transaction pertaining to one parcel of land in Survey No. 9/1A dated 24.04.1998. On a reference under Section 18, after noticing the status of the land and after concluding that the land is not covered under the blue zone and after finding that the Land Acquisition Officer made no reference to the land being on the blue zone in the award, the Reference Court awarded a sum of Rs.100/- per sq. ft. 47. The Reference Court found that the property was within the Akoli City Municipal limits and referring to Exh. 71, 73 and 74 had concluded that the land had high potential and value. Thereafter, it relied on the award of the Reference Court in LAC No. 183 of 2000 (Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6820 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2753 of 2023) and LAC No. 209 of 2002 dated 10.08.2006 (Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6817 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2324 of 2023) which are appeals in this very batch. 48. Our discussion hereinbelow on LAC No.183/2000 dated 15.01.2015 shall insofar as they are relevant, also apply to the disposal by this of Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6820 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(C) No. 2753 of 2023. Similarly, our discussion on LAC No. 209 of 2002 dated 10.08.2006 shall insofar as they are relevant also apply to the disposal by this of Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(C) No. 6817 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(C) No. 2324 of 2023. 2270 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
