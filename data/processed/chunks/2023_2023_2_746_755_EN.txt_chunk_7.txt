STATE OF GUJARAT 755 [SANJAY KAROL, J.] Section 302, Indian Penal Code. In its running into 21 pages, A the Court has simply reproduced the decisions rendered by this Court and presumptively, without actually appreciating or discussing the testimony of PW-3, held him to have deposed truthfully, fully establishing the prosecution case, against the accused, beyond reasonable doubt. 19. Unfortunately, none of the courts below have referred to the B basic principles of criminal jurisprudence. We may also state that the Courts must refrain from committing such grave errors in the future, whereby innocent people are made to suffer incarceration for over a period of nearly two decades, without proper appreciation of evidence. 20.
