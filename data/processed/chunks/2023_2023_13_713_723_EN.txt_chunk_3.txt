The Respondent on 14.10.2020 issued a Notice of Dispute to the appellant under Article 17 read with Article 11.6 and Article 11.7 of 718 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. the Power Purchase Agreement disputing the monthly energy bills and on 15.10.2020 vide I.A. No. 106244 of 2020 the Dispute Notice was sought to be brought on record before this Court. 11. The Second Contempt Petition came to be decided on 09.03.2021 opining that the respondent was guilty of contempt by not complying with the dated 05.10.2017. In eff ect, this Court granted an imprimatur to the calculations of the outstanding dues as understood by the appellant as on 09.03.2021 and directed the respondent to make payment of the same in two equated installments on or before 31.03.2021 and 31.05.2021. 12.

We may now turn to the phraseology used in the dated 09.03.2021 in the Second Contempt Petition. It sketched out the dispute and took note of the contentions that there was another endeavour being made to circumvent the s passed by the Court. This Court, in a chart form, referred to the situation pre and post the in both the appeals and opined that the Court had little doubt that the dated 05.10.2017 had not been complied with. The counsel for the respondent thereafter took some time to obtain instructions, as noticed in that , and came back in the proceedings to state that the respondent will ensure that the is complied in toto. It was also noticed that though the stand of the respondent was that the whole amount stood paid, in the note submitted by them it was admitted NABHA POWER LIMITED v. PUNJAB STATE POWER 719 CORPORATION LIMITED [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] that there were arrears even as per the calculations of the respondent. On the assurance to pay the amounts, for which imprimatur was given in that , the two installments were granted, as prayed for, which would also include interest or any other component, which would be admissible as per the contract inter se the parties and there were also the payments for future charges, which would have to be paid as and when the contractual right arises in favour of the appellants.
