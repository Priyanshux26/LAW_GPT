8 2 Paragraph No. 7 105 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Agra Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. Sri Alladdin and Others (1969) 2 SCC 5983 etc. 8. The protection of the 1946 Act, cannot be denied to a workman merely for the reason that the employer grants him other services benefi ts such as pension, gratuity etc. under CCA Rules. The purpose behind this worker-friendly legislation was explained by this Court in Sudhir Chandra Sarkar v. Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. (1984) 3 SCC 369: “11. Parliament enacted the Industrial Employment (Standing s) Act, 1946 (“1946 Act” for short). The long title of the Act provides that it was an act to require employers in industrial establishments formally to defi ne conditions of employment under them. The preamble of the Act provides that it is expedient to require employers in industrial establishments to defi ne with suffi cient precision the conditions of employment under them and to make the said conditions known to workmen employed by them. By Section 3, a duty was cast on the employer governed by the Act to submit to the Certifying Offi cer draft standing s proposed by him for adoption in his industrial establishment. After going through the procedure prescribed in the Act, the Certifying Offi cer has to certify the draft standing s. Section 8 requires the Certifying Offi cer to keep a copy of standing s as fi nally certifi ed under the Act in a register to be maintained for the purpose. Sub-section (2) of Section 13 imposes a penalty on employer who does any act in contravention of the standing s fi nally certifi ed under the Act. The Act was a legislative response to the laissez faire rule of hire and fi re at sweet will. It was an attempt at imposing a statutory contract of service between two parties unequal to negotiate, on the footing of equality. This was vividly noticed by this Court in Western India Match Company Ltd. v. Workmen [(1974) 3 SCC 330 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 531 : (1974) 1 SCR 434 : (1973) 2 LLJ 403] as under : [SCC para 10, p. 334 : SCC (L&S) p. 536] “In the sunny days of the market economy theory people sincerely believed that the economic law of demand and supply 3 Paragraph No. 5 UNION OF INDIA & ORS. v. K. SURI BABU 1053 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] in the labour market would settle a mutually benefi cial bargain between the employer and the workman. Such a bargain, they took it for granted, would secure fair terms and conditions of employment to the workman. This law they venerated as natural law. They had an abiding faith in the verity of this law. But the experience of the working of this law over a long period has belied their faith.” The intendment underlying the Act and the provisions of the Act enacted to give eff ect to the intendment and the scheme of the Act leave no room for doubt that the Standing s certifi ed under the 1946 Act become part of the statutory terms and conditions of service between the employer and his employee and they govern the relationship between the parties.
