We shall elucidate the framework developed in the African Union, the European Union and the SAARC. i. African Union 127. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child,178 175 CRC, Article 1. 176 CRC, Article 19(1). 177 CRC. Article 19(2) 178 ‘ARWRC’ 1584 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports adopted in 1990,179 builds upon international frameworks by requiring State Parties to enact legislation setting eighteen as the minimum age for marriage. Article 21 of the Charter specifically addresses “Protection against Harmful Social and Cultural Practices,” stating that all necessary measures should be taken to eliminate customs detrimental to children’s health, dignity, and development.180Under Article 21(2), child marriage and betrothal are prohibited, with a mandate that states enact laws setting a minimum marriageable age of eighteen and ensuring compulsory marriage registration.181 128. In Association pour le Progrès et la Défense des Droits des Femmes Maliennes (APDF) and the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa (IHRDA) v. Republic of Mali,182 the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights addressed significant issues regarding child marriage. The applicants argued that Mali’s Family Code of 2011, which set the minimum marriage age for girls at sixteen (with exceptions allowing marriage as young as fifteen), violated key international agreements such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa183 and the ACRWC both of which require a minimum marriage age of eighteen to protect the rights of children. Furthermore, the applicants raised concerns that religious authorities in Mali often performed marriages without ensuring full and free consent from both parties, leading to forced marriages that particularly affected young girls.184 129. The court found that Mali’s Family Code was incompatible with its obligations under multiple international instruments, including the Maputo Protocol, the ACRWC and CEDAW.185 Specifically, the Family Code’s provisions on minimum marriage age and the lack of mandatory consent were seen as violations of these treaties, which seek to eliminate harmful practices and ensure gender equality and 179 The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (1990).
