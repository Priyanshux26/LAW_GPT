306 IPC not made out, thus, cannot be charged u/s. 306 IPC – Appellants discharged from the charges u/s. 306 IPC, however the charge u/s. 498A IPC upheld – Penal Code, 1860. [Paras 14, 15, 26-28] Penal Code, 1860 – s.306 – Abetment of suicide – Necessary ingredients – Explanation: Held: For a conviction u/s. 306 IPC, there must be clear evidence of direct or indirect acts of incitement to commit suicide – Cause of suicide, especially in the context of abetment, involves complex attributes of human behavior and reactions, requiring the Court to rely on cogent and convincing proof of the accused’s role in instigating the act – Mere allegations of harassment are not enough unless the accused’s actions were so compelling that the victim perceived no alternative but to take their own life – Such actions must also be proximate to the time of the suicide – Court examines whether the accused’s conduct, including provoking, urging, or tarnishing the victim’s self-esteem, created an unbearable situation – If the accused's actions were intended only to harass or express anger, they might not meet the threshold for abetment or investigation – Each case demands a careful evaluation of facts, considering the accused’s intent and its impact on the victim.
