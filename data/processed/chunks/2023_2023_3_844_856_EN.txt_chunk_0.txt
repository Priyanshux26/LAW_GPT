GAVAI AND VIKRAM NATH, JJ.] Administration of Justice – Abuse of process of law – Held: Respondent No.1-complainant has attempted to turn a purely contractual dispute between the parties into a criminal case – Not C only that, there is an inordinate delay in lodging the complaint – Further, the complaint even taken at its face value, does not disclose that any of the ingredients of the offence complained of have been made out – Thus, the present complaint is nothing else but an abuse of process of law – Complaint filed before the trial court u/ss.403, D 406, 420, 120B, IPC is dismissed – Impugned and passed by the High Court and trial court are quashed and set aside – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.120-B, 403, 406, 420 r/w s.34 – Security Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 – s.15-HA – Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.34. E Allowing the appeals, the Court HELD: A perusal of the entire complaint would reveal that the only allegation is that accused No.1 Company had sold the shares to itself when the market price of the shares had fallen. The averments are totally contrary to the terms agreed between F the parties in the Inter-Corporate Deposit Agreement (ICDA) as well as in the Letter of Pledge (LoP). The ICDA as well as the LoP specifically authorizes the accused persons/appellants to sell the shares either to themselves or their group of companies. Accused No.1 Company had already invoked the arbitration clause on 14th August 2001. In the arbitration proceedings, a G specific stand was taken by the complainant/respondent No.1 that accused No.1 Company should have invoked the pledge at the stage of the first default, i.e. in May 2000. However, the accused persons/appellants waited till August-September, 2001 to sell the pledged shares which had in the meanwhile depreciated in value. H 844 PRAKASH AGGARWAL v. GANESH BENZOPLAST LIMITED 845 AND ANOTHER Another allegation made before the arbitration proceedings was A that accused No.1 Company had manipulated the price of the shares. Thus, though the complainant/respondent No.1 was aware about the sale of shares as early in the year 2001, he did nothing till the year 2006 when, according to it, it had applied to BSE and NSE for details. Even after the year 2006, the complainant/ B respondent No.1 waited till the year 2011 to lodge the complaint. Though, it is sought to be urged by the complainant/respondent No.1 before this Court that it came to know about the fraudulent act of the accused persons/appellants in the year 2009, which gave a cause of action to it to file the complaint, there is no averment to that effect in the complaint. Insofar as the other C contention that the shares were sold at a lesser price than the market price is concerned, there is no averment in the complaint in that regard.
