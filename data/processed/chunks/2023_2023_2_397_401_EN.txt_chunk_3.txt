Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of enforcement of the 2013 Act i.e. 1-1-2014. D It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.” E 3. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority (supra) and as observed hereinabove that the land belongs to Gram Sabha which was admitted on behalf of the original writ petitioner and the original writ petitioner was not the recorded owner and/or even the owner, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition. The impugned and passed F by the High Court is unsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside. Present appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs. G Divya Pandey Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Abhishek Pratap Singh, LCRA) H
