Digital Supreme Court Reports of the legal principles, none of the essential mandates governing an appeal against acquittal were adverted to by Division Bench of the High Court which proceeded to virtually decide the appeal as a first Court on independent appreciation of evidence and recorded its own findings to hold the accused appellants(A-1, A-2 and A-3) guilty of the charge u/s. 302 r/w. s.34 IPC – Thus, the impugned rendered by the High Court cannot be sustained. [Paras 44, 47, 53, 41] Evidence Act, 1872 – s. 27 – Requirement under law so as to prove a disclosure statement recorded: Held: The statement of an accused recorded by a police officer u/s. 27 of the Evidence Act is basically a memorandum of confession of the accused recorded by the Investigating Officer during interrogation which has been taken down in writing – The confessional part of such statement is inadmissible and only the part which distinctly leads to discovery of fact is admissible in evidence as laid down by this Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh v. Deoman Upadhyaya – Thus, when the Investigating Officer steps into the witness box for proving such disclosure statement, he would be required to narrate what the accused stated to him – The Investigating Officer essentially testifies about the conversation held between himself and the accused which has been taken down into writing leading to the discovery of incriminating fact(s). [Paras 59 and 60] Evidence Act, 1872 – s. 60 – Oral evidence must be direct: Held: As per Section 60 of the Evidence Act, oral evidence in all cases must be direct – The section leaves no ambiguity and mandates that no secondary/hearsay evidence can be given in case of oral evidence, except for the circumstances enumerated in the section – In case of a person who asserts to have heard a fact, only his evidence must be given in respect of the same. [Para 61] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Exhibiting memorandum – Proof of contents – Narration of events – Disclosure statements resulting into discovery of weapons: Held: It is settled that mere exhibiting of memorandum prepared by the Investigating Officer during investigation cannot tantamount to proof of its contents – While testifying on oath, the Investigating Officer would be required to narrate the sequence of events which [2024] 5 S.C.R. 177 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar and Others v. State of Karnataka transpired leading to the recording of the disclosure statement – In the instant case, perusal of the extracted part of the evidence of the Investigating Officer(PW-27), in the backdrop of the exposition of law laid down by this Court, the interrogation memos of the accused A-2(Exhibit P-15) and A-1 (Exhibit P-16), it is clear that the Investigating Officer(PW-27) gave no description at all of the conversation which had transpired between himself and the accused which was recorded in the disclosure statements – Thus, these disclosure statements cannot be read in evidence and the recoveries made in furtherance thereof are non est in the eyes of law – The Investigating Officer(PW-27) also stated that in furtherance of the voluntary statements of accused(A-1 and A-2), he recovered and seized two axes and one koyta produced by A-1 in the field and one jambiya produced by A-2 – The Investigating Officer(PW-27) nowhere stated in his deposition that the disclosure statement of the accused resulted into the discovery of these weapons pursuant to being pointed out by the accused – The Investigating Officer(PW-27) further stated that he arrested accused A-3, recorded his voluntary statement and seized two sickles – However, neither the so called voluntary statement nor the seizure memo were proved by the Investigating Officer(PW-27) in his evidence – Thus, neither the disclosure memos were proved in accordance with law nor the recovery of the weapons from open spaces inspire confidence.
