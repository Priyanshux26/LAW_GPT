at the instance of the accused from the hut and on the basis of a disclosure statement G made by him. [Para 24 (ii)][620-C-H; 621-A-B] (c) Extra Judicial Confession to PW4 The alleged extra judicial confession made by the accused to PW4 was neither disclosed in the FIR nor in the previous statement of PW4 made during investigation. PW4 was confronted H 604 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A with that omission during her deposition in court. That apart, the testimony of PW4 with regard to the accused returning home, making extra judicial confession, changing clothes, washing blood- stained clothes and spreading them to dry has been found unreliable and shaky by the High Court for cogent reasons extracted above, which do not appear perverse as to warrant an B interference. Thus, the circumstance of extra judicial confession is also not proved beyond doubt. [Para 24 (iii)][621-C-E] (d) Accused taking the deceased from home on a bicycle When the court peruse the detailed reasons recorded by the High Court in its to hold that the testimony of PW4 C is not of a stellar quality as to merit conviction solely on its basis, this Court finds no perversity in the High Court’s conclusion as may warrant a reversal of acquittal into a conviction in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution. At what time the accused had taken the deceased on his bicycle is not clear D from the testimony of PW4 though, from the first part of her testimony, it appears that the accused and the deceased were noticed quarrelling with each other at about 1630 hours and soon thereafter, the appellant took the deceased on his cycle. If, from that, the event of taking the deceased on bicycle at about 1630 hours there is still quite a large time-gap between 1630 hours E and 2000 hours for other intervening factors to operate. In light thereof, considering that the place of occurrence was an open place and the other circumstances (i.e. motive, disclosure, recovery and extra judicial confession) were not proved beyond reasonable doubt, shifting the burden on the accused to explain the circumstances in which the deceased sustained injuries, or F to demonstrate that he parted company of the deceased, would not be justified in the facts of the case.
