It reveals from the record that, in the meanwhile, the respondent requested for revising the layout plan in to enable to deposit the requisite amount with the Authority and the layout plans were also revised, but finally the amended layout plan was accepted by the Authority on D 17th August, 2001. It is also not disputed that despite the respondent failed to deposit the instalments in terms of conditions of the bid document by 31st October, 1999 and the final amount being deposited on 25th August, 2005, no action was taken by the appellants either for cancellation of the bid or for forfeiture of the amount deposited by the respondent and what E transpires between the parties is not made available on record but the fact is that the lease deed was finally executed for 18262.89 sq. meters on 29th March, 2006 to the extent of principal amount of Rs.1,32,39,356/ - @Rs.725/- per sq. meter plus the component of interest for the said amount for the delay in deposit of Rs.69,97,087/- total Rs.2,02,18,437/- and the lease deed was executed by the respondent without any demur. F We do not find any justification as to what was the reason for the Authority to grant such undue indulgence to the respondent in depositing the instalments which ought to have been deposited by 31st October, 1999 but were deposited upto 25th August, 2005, be that as it may, it appears that after some round table negotiations to the extent of principal amount G it was adjusted against the auction bid and balance to be adjusted towards interest, the total land which was put to public auction of 27887.50 sq. meters, was reduced to 18262.89 sq. meters and with the consent of parties and without any demur, the lease deed was executed on 29th March, 2006.
