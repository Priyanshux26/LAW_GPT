The conviction of these accused purely on the basis of oral testimony of the interested witnesses, without sufficient corroboration, would not be sustainable. [Para 35][291-C-E] F 1.7 The prosecution has examined PW-3, PW-5, PW-6 and PW-8, none of whom have supported the prosecution case. According to PWs 2, 9 and 13, it was the witness PW-3 who had arranged for the tractor to take the injured persons to the Bazar. However, he has stated that though PW-2 came to his place to G inform him about the incident, she had not informed him as to which of the accused had assaulted the deceased and the injured persons. Thus, the said appellants would also be entitled to benefit of doubt. [Para 36][291-E-F] H NAND LAL AND OTHERS v. THE STATE OF CHHATTISGARH 279 Lakshmi Singh and Others v.
