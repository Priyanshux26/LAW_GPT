A word uttered in a fit of anger or emotion without intending the consequences to actually follow, cannot be said to be instigation.” 4 [2001] Supp. 4 SCR 247 : (2001) 9 SCC 618 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1039 Rohini Sudarshan Gangurde v. The State of Maharashtra & Anr. 12. These principles and necessary ingredients of Section 306 and 107 of Indian Penal Code were reiterated and summarized by this court in recent case of Gurucharan Singh vs State of Punjab.5 13. After carefully considering the facts and evidence recorded by the courts below and the legal position established through statutory and judicial pronouncements, we are of the view that there is no proximate link between the marital dispute in the marriage of deceased with appellant and the commission of suicide. The prosecution has failed to collect any evidence to substantiate the allegations against the appellant. The appellant has not played any active role or any positive or direct act to instigate or aid the deceased in committing suicide. Neither the statement of the complainant nor that of the colleagues of the deceased as recorded by the Investigating Officer during investigation suggest any kind of instigation by the appellant to abet the commission of suicide. There is no allegation against the appellant of suggesting the deceased to commit suicide at any time prior to the commission of suicide by her husband. 14. Thus, none of the three essentials of Section 107 read with Section 306 IPC are existing. 15. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. Impugned of the High Court is set aside. The application for discharge is allowed. Result of the case: Appeal Allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Aandrita Deb, Hony.
