This Court dismissed the SLP on 18.04.2016, declining to intervene in the matter. 14. At every stage the petitioner failed. Initial findings of misconduct and the legitimacy of his dismissal confirmed. After exhausting his legal remedies, the petitioner filed complaints alleging corruption against the judges who decided his case to several authorities including Hon’ble the President of India on 13.02.2012, Hon’ble the Prime Minister of India on 18.12.2017 and 03.01.2018, and Hon’ble the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court on 19.01.2021. 15. The Hon’ble Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court responded to the petitioner’s letter on 23.02.2021, stating that “without a proper review petition, nothing can be done to reopen the issues decided.” The petitioner seized upon this administrative note as a green light to re-litigate his case. In March 2021, the petitioner, filed a Second Review Petition (No. 7558 of 2021) before the High Court along with an application for condonation of delay.4 The High Court, clearly 4 I.A. No. 2748 of 2021 2118 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports exasperated by the petitioner’s persistent and frivolous attempts to revive a long-settled matter, heard the Interim Application and decided the same vide the impugned dated 11.06.2024. The High Court dismissed the application for condonation of delay, holding that it was absolutely baseless and not maintainable in law. It further emphasized the lack of merit in condoning the colossal and inordinate delay of 4088 days (11 years and two months) in reviewing an dated 05.12.2009. While disposing of the Second Review Petition (No. 7558 of 2021), the High Court observed that: “7.…Therefore, instead of adding anything more, we only observe that, this Application is nothing but an unscrupulous idea and attempt to take disadvantage of the technical endorsement of the Hon’ble the Chief Justice. Secondly, as one can easily perceive, the sheer frustration on account of losing the litigation at every stage prompted the Applicant to file this Application coupled with the Review Petition. Thirdly, the Review Petition intended to be filed based on the relief in this Application itself, is wholly misconceived.” 16. Despite the above , the petitioner did not sit quiet. Challenging the aforesaid of the High Court, the petitioner has filed the present Special Leave Petition before this Court. 17. As discussed, the petitioner has jumped from one forum to another, both legal and administrative, agitating his grievance repeatedly, despite the same being well-settled through reasoned s. The forum shopping exercise of the petitioner is summarized in the table hereinbelow: Date Proceedings Decision 14.07.2000 Dismissal passed Competent Authority removed by respondent No. 1 the petitioner from service for misconduct due to frequent and prolonged absence from duty without prior permission or intimation. – Statutory Appeal Appellate Authority dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner, finding no merits therein.
