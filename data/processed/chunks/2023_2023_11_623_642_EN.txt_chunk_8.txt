2.02 (b) is fully supported by the contract conditions.” The member of the tribunal, who dissented, inter alia, recorded that a reading of the specifi cations: “clearly shows that wherever soil is used it will be measured 2.02 (a) with whenever pond ash is used it will be measured under 2.02(b) with TS 305.2.2.3. 13.3.7 I agree with the view taken by the Engineer while rejecting claim, as the view of the Engineer is strictly as per contract/BOQ provision as in this particular Contract embankment with soil and pond ash appear under one item and are · very conspicuously bifurcated for diff erent materials. M/S HINDUSTAN CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED v. 635 M/S NATIONAL HIGHWAYS AUTHORITY OF INDIA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 13.3.8 I analyse that claimant has fl awed under and after thought to claim even soil as fl y ash under item No.2.02 (b). of BOQ. 13.3.9 Thus I draw fi rm conclusion that the provision made in the BOQ item 2.02 (a) and 2.02 (b) are for diff erent material i.e. 2.02 (a) is for soil and 2.02 (b)is for pond ash and is for type of material to be used in the respective items.” 18. A reasoning similar to the majority award, which was in issue in the main , was adopted in awards, rendered by tribunals of other contractors, such as CEC -HCC(JV)11; Sunway Construction12; Patel KNR JV13; and Oriental Structural Engineers (P) Ltd (hereafter, “Oriental Structures”)14.

In some cases, the DRP (or DRB) set up departmentally, with three experts (in CA 4659/2023) expressed its view in the following terms: “4.1.5...The above contract stipulation clearly means that the Embankment 6 or Subgrade, as the case may be, shall be measured separately by taking cross sections at intervals before the Embankment work starts and after its completion. The use of phrase ‘taking cross sections ....... before the Embankment work starts and after its completion’ means nothing but measurement of embankment as o whole. In other words what is to be measured is an embankment and such measurement shall be by taking cross sections at suitable intervals before the start of Embankment work and after completion of Embankment of work.
