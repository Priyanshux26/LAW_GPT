The High Court also noted that the State Government had meanwhile remitted the sentence of the other two co-accused as both had undergone more than 19 years of imprisonment. However, the appellant was directed to surrender and to carry out his sentence. While rejecting the plea of juvenility, the reasons given by the High Court are as follows: “20...It is undisputed that juvenility can be examined at any stage, if raised by the accused person. In the present case, appellant no. 3 has raised the point of his juvenility before the trial court, which was dealt with after examining the court witnesses and evidences placed by means of parivar register, radiological report, C.M.O. report and the scholar register of Rashtriya Inter College and rejected by the court below vide dated 21.08.1999. As no good ground has been taken in the present appeal of juvenility of appellant no. 3. It is also relevant to mention here that aforesaid dated 21st August, 1999 was challenged by the appellant no. 3 in Criminal Revision No. 271 of 1999, which was also dismissed by this Court vide dated 16.09.1999”. PAWAN KUMAR v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS. 267 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] The appellant had mostly remained on bail during the period of trial and appeal, but consequent to the decision of the High Court, he surrendered on 29.07.2019 and since then he has been in jail. By now he has served a sentence of about 4 ½ years. 13. The specifi c grievance of the appellant in the present case is that the Trial Court had not accepted the veracity of the Scholar Register of National Inter College, Barabanki because it was based on a Transfer Certifi cate issued by High School, Kamela which was not on record. However, when the appellant had placed the same on record, in his application under Section 391 of CrPC, the same ought to have been considered. 14. This Court passed dated 08.10.2021 and directed the Trial Court to submit a fresh report on the plea of juvenility raised by the appellant, after appreciating the additional evidence. The dated 08.10.2021 of this Court reads as under: - “…Learned counsel for the petitioner submits by reference to additional documents that CM No.96164/2012 was fi led under Section 391 of the Cr.P.C for taking on record additional documents in the form of transfer certifi cate showing the date of birth of the applicant as 05.07.1980. She has also fi led a document regarding listing of the applications as on 29.01.2020 before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench to show such application as pending as on 01.11.2012 for disposal. It is thus, her submission that the application seeking to bring on record additional documents in support of the plea of juvenility was never dealt with. Our attention has been invited at para 20 of the impugned which recognizes that plea of juvenility was raised before the trial Court and was rejected by the dated 21.08.1999. It has been observed that no ground has been taken in the appeal of juvenility of appellant No.3 possibly because a Criminal Revision was fi led against the dated 21.08.1999 being Criminal Revision No.271/1999 which was also dismissed by the High Court on 16.09.1999.
