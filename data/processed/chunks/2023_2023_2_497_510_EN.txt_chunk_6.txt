Consequently, the amount of 36.75 crores was a composite one, meant to discharge all claims by the Agrawals on the company. The Kotharis had clearly stated that the amount offered by them was, if accepted, to G settle ‘all claims’, as was also worded in the prayer in their suit (see paragraph 5 above). 11. Learned counsel argued that the so-called ambiguity created in this case was an afterthought, meant to escape and evade the decree drawn. Further, the fact that the Agrawals did not file a written statement H 506 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A to the plaint, or reply to the Notice of Motion, contesting the pleadings of the Kotharis with respect to the meaning of the emails dated 28.03.2019 onwards, clearly points to their acceptance of the suit averments. Reliance was placed on the s of this Court in Rajinder Kumar v. Kuldeep Singh,6 S. Satnam Singh & Ors. v. Surender Kaur & Anr.,7 and Bhavan Vaja and Ors. v. Solanki Hanuji Khodaji B Mansang,8 to reinforce these submissions. III. Analysis 12. The only issue for consideration is whether the sum of 36.75 crores stipulated in the agreement by email dated 28.03.2019 was inclusive of the loan amount of 10,29,55,000/- or not. C 13. The decree awarded (on agreement by both parties) captures, in essence, parts (A) to (D) of the prayer made by the Kotharis in their suit. They are analogous to the terms of the agreement dated 28.03.2019, which allude only to the ‘sale of the 50% shareholding of the defendants’ (i.e., of the Agrawals), and do not mention anything D separately regarding the outstanding loan amount. 14. The single judge has described the decree as ‘ambiguous’ simply on the absence of its engagement with the loan amount, and proceeded to go behind it by looking into the pleadings (of only the respondents, as appellants had not filed any – which has been adversely E inferred by the Court) – and relied on the term, ‘free of all claims of the defendants’ contained in the decree, to enlarge its scope to include the contested amount. Affirming the same, the Division Bench of the High Court has laid emphasis on the exchange of emails pursuant to the one containing the agreement, especially the email dated 29.03.2019 sent by Kotharis outlining the break-up of the amount for the first time, F which was expressly rejected by Agrawals in their response dated 11.04.2019. There was a clear lack of consensus on this inclusion. Both the Courts’ interpretation of reading the Agrawals’ consent into the same is clearly an exercise in overreach. 15. This Court has time and again cautioned against the Execution G Court adopting such an approach. In Topanmal Chhotamal v. Kundomal Gangaram,9a three-judge bench held as follows: 6 Rajinder Kumar v. Kuldeep Singh, (2014) 15 SCC 529. 7 S. Satnam Singh & Ors. v. Surender Kaur & Anr., (2009) 2 SCC 562. 8 Bhavan Vaja and Ors. v. Solanki Hanuji Khodaji Mansang, (1973) 2 SCC 40.
