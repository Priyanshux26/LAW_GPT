In response, learned counsel for respondents No. 1 and 2 submitted that it was merely an oversight mistake which occurred at the time of filing of the suit and at the subsequent stage for which the amendment was prayed for by respondents No. 1 and 2. It is not a case where the pleadings to that effect are not available on record. Respondents No. 1 and 2 had fairly pleaded about the earlier compromise decree. 6 [2009] 15 SCR 103 : (2009) 10 SCC 84 7 [2008] 17 SCR 505 : (2009) 2 SCC 409 940 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Inadvertently, the prayer for declaration thereof as null and void could not be made. The court fee also could not be deposited. No fresh evidence is to be led. The case is at the arguments stage. The same can be argued with mere re-framing of the issues. It will avoid multiplicity of litigation and ultimately complete justice will be done amongst the parties, who are merely praying for partition of the ancestral property. The other side can be compensated with costs, as was even done by the High Court. No prejudice as such will be caused to the appellant. Substantial justice will be done to the parties. In support of the arguments, reliance was placed upon a of this Court in Dondapati Narayana Reddy v. Duggireddy Venkatanarayana Reddy and others8 and Estralla Rubber v. Dass Estate (P) Ltd.9 5. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the relevant referred record. 6. It is a case in which the appellant has been forced into avoidable unnecessary litigation to rush to this Court. The suit was filed by respondents No. 1 and 2 in 2005 seeking partition of the ancestral property. It was specifically pleaded in the suit that there was a compromise decree between the parties. However, as may be the advice to respondents No. 1 and 2, despite there being a compromise decree existing between the parties, no prayer was made in the suit with reference thereto, if any grievance was there. It remained simpliciter a suit for partition. A specific stand was taken by the appellant in the written statement to the effect that the suit is not maintainable unless cancellation of the compromise decree is prayed for as the same would operate as res-judicata. The written statement was filed in August 2005. Despite the specific pleading of the appellant, the respondents No. 1 and 2 did not take any steps. 6.1 During the pendency of the suit, an amendment was carried out by respondents No. 1 and 2 to implead respondent No. 4 in the suit who was the purchaser of a part of the suit property. The same was allowed on 01.07.2006. Thereafter, trial of the suit continued. When it reached at the stage of arguments in February 2010 an application was filed by respondents No. 1 and 8 (2001) 8 SCC 115 9 [2001] Suppl. 3 SCR 68 : (2001) 8 SCC 97 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
