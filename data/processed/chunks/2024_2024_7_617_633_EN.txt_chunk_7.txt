11. The CIC has approached this Court by way of the present appeal against the High Court’s . The appellant, while not challenging the quashing of the dated 22.9.2009, seeks to challenge the High Court’s regarding the Regulations and the scope of the powers vested in the CIC under Section 12(4) of the 628 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports RTI Act. The CIC maintains that the Regulations were framed within the scope of its statutory authority to ensure effective management and functioning of the Commission and that the ability to constitute Committees is an integral part of this mandate. 12. Having considered the respective submissions, the primary issue to be considered is whether the CIC, under the provisions of Section 12(4) of the RTI Act, has the authority to constitute benches of the CIC and frame Regulations for the effective management and allocation of work within the Commission, including the issuance of s and the formation of committees. 13. At the outset, it is pertinent to elaborate on the relevant provisions of the RTI Act apropos the present issue. Section 12 of the RTI Act outlines the constitution and powers of the CIC. The Central Government is mandated to establish the CIC, which consists of the CIC and a specified number of Information Commissioners, not exceeding ten, as deemed necessary. Crucially, Section 12(4) of the RTI Act grants CIC the general superintendence, direction, and management of the Commission’s affairs. This provision implies that the CIC has comprehensive authority to oversee and direct the functioning. This broad section allows the CIC to implement measures that ensure smooth and efficient functioning of the Commission, including the formation of benches of the Commission, including making decisions necessary for its effective operation. 14. Section 15 of the RTI Act mirrors the provisions of Section 12 but applies to the State Information Commissions. It similarly establishes the State Information Commissions and outlines the powers and responsibilities of the State Chief Information Commissioner and State Information Commissioners. Both Sections 12 and 15 of the RTI Act use similar language, emphasizing the wide-ranging powers of the CIC and the State Chief Information Commissioners to manage their respective commissions’ affairs autonomously and without external interference. This language clearly suggests that the legislative intent was to provide these officials with broad authority to ensure their commissions function effectively. 15. The High Court of Delhi, in its impugned dated 21.05.2010, quashed the Regulations framed by the CIC. The Court specifically took issue with Regulation 22, which dealt with the constitution of Benches within the Commission. The High Court held that the RTI [2024] 7 S.C.R. 629 Central Information Commission v. D.D.A. & Anr. Act did not explicitly provide for the formation of benches by the CIC. According to the Court, the statutory framework and rules made under the RTI Act did not contain any provision allowing for Single or Division Benches of Information Commissioners. 16. In our opinion, the High Court’s interpretation was based on a restrictive reading of the RTI Act, focusing on the absence of explicit provisions for benches within the RTI Act.
