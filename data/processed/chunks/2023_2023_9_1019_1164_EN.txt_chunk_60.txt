To further clarify this position, it must be noted that the authorities have treated the landowner as a “subject” of medieval India, but D not as a “citizen” under our Constitution.” 83. It has been followed in Bhimandas Ambwani (Dead) through LRs v. Delhi Power Company Ltd.39. 84. While on the issue relating to the aspect of acquisition, a case arose under the Coffee Act in Coffee Board, Karnataka, Bangalore E v. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Karnataka and others40 and the question which arose was whether the coffee grower who made a sale made compulsorily to the Coffee Board amounted to sale or was it an acquisition. It is apposite that we advert to the following paragraphs: “28. Since all persons including the Coffee Board are prohibited F from purchasing/selling coffee in law, there could be no sale or purchase to attract the imposition of sales/purchase tax it was urged. Even if there was compulsion there would be a sale as was the position in Vishnu Agencies [(1978) 2 SCR 433 : (1978) 1 SCC 520 : 1978 SCC (Tax) 31 : AIR 1978 SC 449] . This Court therein approved the minority opinion of Hidayatullah, J. in New G India Sugar Mills v. CST [New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. CST, AIR 1963 SC 1207 : 1963 Supp (2) SCR 459 : (1963) 14 STC 38 (2013) 1 SCC 353 39 (2013) 14 SCC 195 40 (1988) 3 SCC 263, H 1100 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A 316] . In the nature of the transactions contemplated under the Act mutual assent either express or implied is not totally absent in this case in the transactions under the Act. Coffee growers have a volition or option, though minimal or nominal to enter into the coffee growing trade. Coffee growing was not compulsory. If anyone decides to grow coffee or continue to grow coffee, he B must transact in terms of the regulation imposed for the benefit of the coffee growing industry. Section 25 of the Act provides the Board with the right to reject coffee if it is not up to the standard. Value to be paid as contemplated by the Act is the price of the coffee. Fixation of price is regulation but is a matter of dealing C between the parties. There is no time fixed for delivery of coffee either to the Board or the curer. These indicate consensuality which is not totally absent in the transaction.” It was found that it was a sale which took place. 85. Article 31 stands omitted and Article 19(1)(f) also stands D deleted by way of the Forty-Fourth Amendment to the Constitution which came into effect from 20.06.1979. It is by the very same amendment that Article 300A was inserted in the Constitution. Article 300A is a resurrection of Article 31 (1). This Court in the in Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar v. State of Gujarat41 held as follows: “34. The right of eminent domain is the right of the sovereign E State, through its regular agencies, to reassert, either temporarily or permanently, its dominion over any portion of the soil of the State including private property without its owner’s consent on account of public exigency and for the public good.
