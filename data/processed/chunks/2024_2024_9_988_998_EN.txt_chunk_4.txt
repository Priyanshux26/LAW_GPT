Meaning thereby, it is clear that in case the tenant is in arrears of four months, the suit may lie, but such rent may be deposited within one month from the date of service on him. In case, the due rent along with damages and occupation charges is not paid as required under Section 20(2)(a) of the UP Rent Act read with Sections 20(4) and 30 of the Act, no protection would be available as stipulated under Section 20 of the said Act. 14. In case the landlord refuses to accept the rent, which is required to be paid by the tenant, then such amount can be deposited in the manner prescribed under Section 30 of UP Rent Act and the tenant can continue to deposit rent due even for any subsequent period until the landlord signifies by notice to accept the same by his willingness. Therefore, it can safely be said that in addition to cause of action to file a suit for arrears of due rent of not less than four months, if the rent is not deposited regularly, including the damages and the occupational charges along with the interest @ 9%, the suit seeking eviction can be maintained and decreed. 15. As already noted, the ground of sub-letting has not been pressed and during hearing, learned counsel for the appellant(s) – landlord has pressed this appeal only for non-payment of rent, therefore, we are appreciating the said issue only. In this regard, if we peruse 994 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the findings of the Trial Court on Issue Nos. 5 and 6, then it clearly indicates that such findings are relying upon Exhibits K1 to K6 – receipt of the rents and Exhibits K7 to K12 – receipts of sending the Money s and Exhibits K13 and K14, which relate to deposit of the money in the Court of Munsiff, Gorakhpur. Those documents, i.e., Exhibits K1 to K6 have not been produced, but placed before us. On perusal, it is clear that those are receipts of rent for the years 1984, 1988, 1989 and K6 is receipt of 31.03.1990 depositing consolidated rent of ₹3460/-, which is from April 1989 to March, 1990. Thus, except receipt K6, no other receipt relates to the demand of rent by notice in the suit. From the document Exhibits K7 to K12, it is not clear that these Money s were of which period of rent. Similar is the position with document Exhibits K13 and K14. Therefore, those documents are not sufficient to discharge burden of payment or deposit of rent by respondent – tenant and to shift onus on appellant – landlord. Similarly on filing the suit on 06.02.1992, whether the rent was regularly paid by the respondent – tenant as contemplated under Section 20(4) including Section 30(1) of the UP Rent Act has not been considered. 16. By the proceeding dated 18.09.2018 of the case, this Court directed the respondent – tenant to file an affidavit giving details of the payment of the rent.
