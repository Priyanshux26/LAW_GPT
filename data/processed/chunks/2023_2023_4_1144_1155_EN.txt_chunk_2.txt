It then states- “As there is no proper evidence in this regard, it shall be considered as a false case…” B 6. Interestingly, another Final Report (hereafter, FR-II) forms part of the record. It states that witness number 10, namely S. Anilkumar, Inspector of Police, Viakom, conducted further investigation as per No. D2-43642/16/K passed by the District Police Chief, Kottayam. 7. It has been urged by way of this appeal that in effect, a re- C investigation had been ed, in violation of the procedure laid down in law. Further it has been argued that; the ingredients of Section 420, IPC have not been met- and therefore the High court has erred in not quashing the proceedings subject of the petition under Section 482; No specific role has been attributed to the appellant; That in all of the witness D statements, the name mentioned is that of the de-facto complainant who gave the money to the deceased accused number 1 namely, Babu and was the instigator in other people giving the money to him. The Appellant seeks reliance on Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali1; T.T Antony v. State of Kerala2; Vinubhai Haribhai Malviya and Ors v. State of Gujarat3; Randhir Singh Rana v. State (NCT of Delhi)4; G.V Rao v. L.H.V E Prasad5; Hari Prasad Chamaria v. Bishun Kumar Surekha6. 8. Having taken note of the facts that have led to the present appeal by special leave petition and the chief arguments made, we now proceed to examine the law on the issues before us. 9. On the second question, that is whether District Police Chief, F Kottayam’s was permissible in law or not, the relevant provisions of CrPC is Section 173 (8) which reads as under: “(8) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude further investigation in respect of an offence after a report under sub- section (2) has been forwarded to the Magistrate and, where upon G 1 (2013) 5 SCC 762 2 (2001) 6 SCC 181 3 2019 SCC OnLine 1346 4 (1997) 1 SCC 361 5 (2000) 3 SCC 693 6 (1973) 2 SCC 823 H 1148 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A such investigation, the officer in charge of the police station obtains further evidence, oral or documentary, he shall forward to the Magistrate a further report or reports regarding such evidence in the form prescribed; and the provisions of sub- sections (2) to (6) shall, as far as may be, apply in relation to such report or reports as they apply in relation to a report forwarded under sub- section B (2).” 10. The evolution of Section 173 CrPC has been noted by this Court in Vinubhai Haribhai Malaviya (supra). In Para 25, it is opined that investigation after the coming into force of the Cr.PC, 1973 will include all proceedings under Cr.PC for collection of evidence conducted C by a police officer. “All” would undoubtedly then include Section 173 (8) as well. The power therefore, under Section 190, of a Magistrate ing such investigation, would encompass further investigation under Section 173 (8).
