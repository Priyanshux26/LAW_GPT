23. We now examine the law that deals with oral gifts and their validity under Mohammedan Law. A hiba literally means “the donation of a thing from which the donee may derive benefit”. Technically, it is “an unconditional transfer of property, made immediately and without any exchange or consideration, by one person to another and accepted by or on behalf of the latter.”16 24. The position of oral gift is well settled by the Courts of law. In ‘Outlines of Mohammadan Law’,17 A.A. Faizee described ‘gift’ as: “A man may lawfully make a gift of his property to another during his lifetime; or he may give it away to someone after his death by will. The first is called a disposition 16 Hedaya, 482 17 (2009) 6 SCC 160 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 937 Mansoor Saheb (Dead) & Ors. v. Salima (D) By Lrs. & Ors. inter vivos; the second, a testamentary disposition. Muhammadan law permits both kinds of transfers; but while a disposition inter vivos is unfettered as to quantum, a testamentary disposition is limited to one-third of the net estate. Muhammadan law allows a man to give away the whole of his property during his lifetime, but only one-third of it can be bequeathed by will.” Ameer Ali defines ‘hiba’ in the following terms: “A hiba is a voluntary gift without consideration of property or the substance of thing by one person to another so as to constitute the donee the proprietor of the subject matter of the gift.” While referring to Mohammedan Law, by Syed Ameer Ali,18 the Privy Council in Mohd. Abdul Ghani v. Fakhr Jahan Begam19 observed: “For a valid gift inter vivos under the Mahomedan law applicable in this case, three conditions are necessary, which their Lordships consider have been correctly stated thus: “(a) manifestation of the wish to give on the part of the donor; (b) the acceptance of the donee, either impliedly or expressly; and (c) the taking of possession of the subject-matter of the gift by the donee, either actually or constructively.” (Emphasis supplied) This Court, in Jamila Begum v. Shami Mohd.,20 reiterated the essentials of valid and complete gift as laid down in Abdul Rahim (supra),21: “23. Under the Mohammedan law, no doubt, making oral gift is permissible. … 13. The conditions to make a valid and complete gift under the Mohammadan law are as under: 18 4th ed., vol. i., p. 41. 19 1922 SCC OnLine PC 18 20 [2018] 13 SCR 1253 : (2019) 2 SCC 727 21 (2009) 6 SCC 160 938 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (a) The donor should be sane and major and must be the owner of the property which he is gifting. (b) The thing gifted should be in existence at the time of hiba. (c) If the thing gifted is divisible, it should be separated and made distinct. (d) The thing gifted should be such property to benefit from which is lawful under the Shariat. (e) The thing gifted should not be accompanied by things not gifted i.e.
