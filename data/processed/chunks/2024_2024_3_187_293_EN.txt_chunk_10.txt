Prima facie, we do not appreciate the necessity of having a zoo inside Tiger Reserves or National Parks. The concept of protecting Tiger Reserves and National Parks is that the fauna must be permitted to reside in the natural habitat and not the artificial environs. 6. We, therefore, call upon the NTCA to explain the rationale behind granting such a permission for permitting Tiger Safaris within Tiger Reserves and National Parks. 7. Until further s, we restrain the authorities from making any construction within the areas notified as Tiger Reserves and National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries. 8.
