There must be prima facie case of deliberate falsehood on a matter of substance and the court should be satisfied that there is reasonable foundation for the charge…” (Emphasis supplied) Referred to in Himanshu Kumar (supra); Narendra Kumar Srivastava v. State of Bihar & Ors.9 14. In this regard we may also notice the pronouncement in R.S. Sujatha v. State of Karnataka,10 referred to in Aarish Asgar Qureshi v. Fareed Ahmad Qureshi 11 wherein it was observed : “9. Both these s were referred to and relied upon with approval in R.S. Sujatha v. State of Karnataka [R.S. Sujatha v. State of Karnataka (2011) 5 SCC 689 : (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 757] (at paras 15 and 16). This court, after setting down the law laid down in these two s concluded : (SCC pp. 694-95, para 18) 8 [1971] Supp. 1 SCR 172 : (1971) 1 SCC 774 9 [2019] 2 SCR 643 : (2019) 3 SCC 318 10 [2010] 14 SCR 227 : (2011) 5 SCC 689 11 [2019] 3 SCR 400 : (2019) 18 SCC 172 342 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “18. Thus, from the above, it is evident that the inquiry/ contempt proceedings should be initiated by the court in exceptional circumstances where the court is of the opinion that perjury has been committed by a party deliberately to have some beneficial from the court. There must be grounds of a nature higher than mere surmise or suspicion for initiating such proceedings. There must be distinct evidence of the commission of an offence by such a person as mere suspicion cannot bring home the charge of perjury. More so, the court has also to determine as on facts, whether it is expedient in the interest of justice to inquire into the offence which appears to have been committed.” (Emphasis supplied) 15. The three essential factors which can be said to be sine qua non for the application of Section 193 IPC as held in Bhima Razu Prasad v. State Rep. by Deputy Supdt. of Police, CBI/SPE/ACU-II 12 are :- (1) false statement made on oath or in affidavits; (2) that such statements be made in a judicial proceeding; or (3) such statement be made before an authority that has been expressly deemed to be a ‘Court’. 16. What we may conclude from a perusal of the above-noticed judicial pronouncements is that:- (i) The Court should be of the prima facie opinion that there exists sufficient and reasonable ground to initiate proceedings against the person who has allegedly made a false statement(s); (ii) Such proceedings should be initiated when doing the same is “expedient in the interests of justice to punish the delinquent” and not merely because of inaccuracy in statements that may be innocent/immaterial; (iii) There should be “deliberate falsehood on a matter of substance”; 12 [2021] 2 SCR 1020 : (2021) 19 SCC 25 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 343 James Kunjwal v. State of Uttarakhand & Anr. (iv) The Court should be satisfied that there is a reasonable foundation for the charge, with distinct evidence and not mere suspicion; (v) Proceedings should be initiated in exceptional circumstances, for instance, when a party has perjured themselves to beneficial s from the Court.
