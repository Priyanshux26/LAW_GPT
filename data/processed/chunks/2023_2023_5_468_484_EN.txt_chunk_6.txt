24th November 2007. It is submitted that even in the PPAs signed with Haryana Utilities on 7th August 2008, there is no bifurcation of domestic and imported coal. He submits that though the Standing Linkage Committee (Long-Term) (hereinafter referred to as “SLC (LT)”) has considered AP(M)L’s application for 100% coal of its total capacity, it has granted linkage only for 70% of 1980 MW, i.e. 1386 F MW only. He submitted that linkage of balance 30% was deferred to the future. 19. Dr. Singhvi further submitted that the SLC (LT) is a statutory body and its decision would amount to Change in Law. In this respect, he relies on the of this Court in the case of Ashoka Smokeless G Coal India (P) Ltd. and others v. Union of India and others2. 20. When we heard this batch of Electricity appeals, it was agreed between all the parties that this Court should first decide Civil Appeal H 2 (2007) 2 SCC 640 UTTAR HARYANA BIJLI VITRAN NIGAM LTD. v. S ADANI 477 POWER (MUNDRA) LIMITED [B. R. GAVAI, J.] No. 684 of 2021 (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company A Limited v. Adani Power Maharashtra Limited and Others3) [“MSEDCL v. APML and Others”, for short] and Civil Appeal No. 6927 of 2021 (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited v. GMR Warora Energy Ltd. and Others) inasmuch as three of the issues involved in all the appeals in the batch were common. It B was submitted that those two appeals could be decided by deciding the three common issues. However, insofar as the other appeals are concerned, it was submitted that, in addition to the three common issues, certain additional issues were also involved and it was agreed that after those two appeals are decided, the other appeals should be heard for considering these additional issues. C 21. The said three common issues are thus: (i) Whether ‘Change in Law’ relief on account of NCDP 2013 should be on ‘actuals’ viz. as against 100% of normative coal requirement assured in terms of NCDP 2007 OR D restricted to trigger levels in NCDP 2013 viz. 65%, 65%, 67% and 75% of Assured Coal Quantity (ACQ)?

E (iii) Whether ‘Change in Law’ relief compensation is to be granted from 1st April 2013 (start of Financial Year) or 31st July 2013 (date of NCDP 2013)? 22. After extensively hearing all the learned counsel for the parties, F vide the and dated 3rd March 2023 in the case of MSEDCL v.
