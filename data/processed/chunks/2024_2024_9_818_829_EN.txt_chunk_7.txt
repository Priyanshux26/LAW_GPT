Moreover, the presence of the accused in the house at the time of occurrence is not proved. In such circumstances, the death was most probably [2024] 9 S.C.R. 829 Shoor Singh & Anr. v. State of Uttarakhand suicidal though this would not make a difference for commission of an offence punishable under Section 304-B IPC if all the other ingredients of dowry death stand proved. But, as noted above, here harassment/ cruelty at the instance of the appellants in connection with any demand for dowry has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. As regards the reason to commit suicide, though it is not necessary for us to dwell upon, suffice it to say that husband of the deceased was in service and stayed away from the deceased. Suggestion was given to the prosecution witnesses, and statement was also made under Section 313 CrPC, that the deceased used to remain depressed for being unable to join her husband at the place of his posting due to lack of residential quarter. That apart, a photograph of the deceased (Ex. Kha 1), regarding which no dispute was raised by the prosecution witnesses, showing her alone with a male stranger had surfaced. In the statement under Section 313 CrPC a stand was taken that this photograph had shamed her. Be that as it may, once all the necessary ingredients of dowry death have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, the presumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act would not be available to the prosecution. Hence, in our considered view, the appellants are entitled to be acquitted of the charge of offences punishable under Section 304-B and 498-A IPC. 19. The appeal is accordingly allowed. The convicting and sentencing the appellants under Section 304-B and 498-A IPC is set aside. The appellants are on bail. They need not surrender. Their bail bond(s) stand discharged. 20. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of. Result of the Case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
