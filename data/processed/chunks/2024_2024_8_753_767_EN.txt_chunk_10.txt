The High Court, we have no hesitation in saying so, erred in law. Ergo, for reasons recorded above and upon circumspect consideration of the attendant facts and circumstances, we hold that the discretion exercised by the learned Single Judge of the High Court to grant bail to the respondent no.1 was not in tune with the principles that conventionally govern exercise of such power, a plurality of which stand enunciated in the case-law supra. Moreover, though respondent no.1 had already suffered incarceration for a period of about six months at the time when bail was granted, yet in view of the nature of the alleged offence, his release on bail can seriously lead to dissipation of the properties where investments have allegedly been made out of Society funds. At the end of the day, the interests of the victims of the scam have also to be factored in. 27. Accordingly, the appeal succeeds. The impugned stands set aside. Respondent No.1 is directed to surrender within a period of three weeks from today, failing which the trial Court shall proceed in accordance with law. We clarify that the observations made hereinabove are limited to the aspect of testing the legality of the impugned . They shall not be treated as definitive/conclusive regarding respondent no.1 or any other accused. The trial Court in seisin shall proceed uninfluenced and in accordance with law. Given the peculiar circumstances, where bail is being cancelled after a period of almost 3 years, it is deemed appropriate to grant liberty to the respondent no.1 to apply for bail at a later period or in the event of a change in circumstances. Needless to state, such application, if and when preferred, shall be considered on its own merits, without being prejudiced by the instant . The authorities concerned are directed to render appropriate care and assistance as regards the medical condition of the respondent no.1. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
