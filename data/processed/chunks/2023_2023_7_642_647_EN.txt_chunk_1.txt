Under challenge in the appeal was a summoning D dated 16th October, 2021 passed by the relevant Special Court under the 1989 Act, in exercise of power conferred on him by Section 319, Code of Criminal Procedure (hereafter, ‘Cr. PC’). 2. A First Information Report (hereafter ‘FIR’) came to be registered by the Khalilabad Police Station, District Sant Kabir Nagar, E under Sections 419, 420, 323, 406 and 506, Indian Penal Code and 3(1)(r) & (s) of the 1989 Act on the basis of information furnished by the complainant. Accusations were levelled against (1) Dharmendra Nath Mishra (hereafter ‘Dharmendra’); (2) brother of Dharmendra; and (3) an ‘unknown person’ of having assaulted and abused the complainant F and his wife, amounting to commission of offences punishable under the aforesaid provisions. Investigation of the FIR culminated in a charge- sheet under Section 173(2) of the Cr. PC being filed, wherein Dharmendra was shown as the sole accused. The Special Court constituted under the 1989 Act took cognisance of the offence and framed charges against Dharmendra, whereafter the trial commenced. In course thereof, the G complainant and his wife deposed as PW-1 & PW-2 respectively. According to them, Dharmendra and the appellant together with an unknown person had assaulted them apart from hurling caste related abuses. H 644 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A 3. At this stage, the Special Court passed the dated 16.10.2021 summoning the appellant for trial along with Dharmendra for offences punishable under Sections 323, 504 and 506, IPC and 3(1)(r) & (s) of the 1989 Act. The said dated 16th October, 2021 was unsuccessfully challenged by the appellant before the High Court which, by its dated 1st June, 2022, dismissed the appeal of the appellant B under Section 14A(1) of the 1989 Act as noted above. 4. Mr. Pandey, learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended as follows: (i) The FIR is grossly delayed. Although the incident of assault C and abuse giving rise to the FIR allegedly happened on 30th September, 2017, the complainant lodged the complaint as late as on 28th February, 2018. There is no cogent explanation for such belated lodging of complaint and this is an indicator that the contents of the FIR are absolutely false. (ii) There are material contradictions in the versions of PW-1 & PW- 2. While PW-1 deposed that Dharmendra, his brother (i.e., the D appellant) and an unknown person were travelling in a car when they stopped PW-1 and his family members whereafter the alleged incident of assault and abuse took place, PW-2 deposed that the accused persons (Dharmendra, the appellant and an unknown person) arrived at the place of occurrence riding two motorcycles. Therefore, the depositions of PW- E 1 & PW-2 are absolutely unreliable and untrustworthy. (iii) It is to be found in the versions of PW-1 & PW-2 that since 2015, they personally knew the appellant; hence, not naming the appellant in the FIR and instead disclosing that the brother of Dharmendra too had involved himself in the alleged assault and abuse and taking the name of F the appellant as a co-accused only in course of recording of evidence is a clear embellishment, which has been made with a view to harass the appellant by dragging him to face an unnecessary trial.
