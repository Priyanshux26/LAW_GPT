The Supreme Court Collegium on 12.07.2023 however resolved to defer consideration for the two petitioners for the present with the observation that it will be taken up by the Collegium at an appropriate stage. The senior counsel then submits that the persons who were recommended in December, 2022 along with the petitioners have since been appointed as Judges of the High Court on 28.07.2023. 3. The Supreme Court thereafter on 04.01.2024 resolved that the proposal for elevation of the two petitioners be remitted to the Chief Justice [2024] 9 S.C.R. 155 Chirag Bhanu Singh & Anr. v. High Court of Himachal Pradesh & Ors. of the Himachal Pradesh High Court for fresh recommendation by the High Court. This decision is reflected in the communication dated 16.01.2024 addressed by the Minister for Law and Justice to the Chief Justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court where request is made that fresh recommendations be sent for the two officers i.e., Chirag Bhanu Singh and Arvind Malhotra against the unfilled vacancies from service quota in the Himachal Pradesh High Court. 4. Projecting the grievances of the petitioners, Mr. Datar would submit that the Himachal Pradesh High Court Collegium on 23.04.2024 has recommended the names of two other Judicial Officers for elevation as High Court Judges without first acting on the recommendations of the Supreme Court Collegium and the 16.01.2024 letter of the Law Minister, for reconsideration of the two petitioners. Since both petitioners are the senior most judicial officers, Mr. Datar contends that if recently recommended judicial officers are considered for elevation, it will cause serious prejudice to the expectations of the petitioners who have unblemished service record as Judicial Officers. 5. Issue notice only to the Registrar General of the Himachal Pradesh High Court so that appropriate information can be obtained on whether the High Court Collegium had reconsidered the cases of the two petitioners, pursuant to the Supreme Court Resolution dated 04.01.2024 and the Law Minister’s Communication dated 16.01.2024.” 6. Following the above notice, a Report in sealed cover was filed by the Registrar General of the Himachal Pradesh High Court. The Report was perused and was also furnished to the learned Counsel for the writ Petitioners. 7. The Report of the Registrar General, reflected that the Resolution of the Supreme Court Collegium (dated 4th January, 2024) was never received by the Chief Justice of the High Court. It was further 156 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports stated that the Chief Justice of the High Court had written to the Chief Justice of India on 11th December 2023 seeking guidance on whether the Collegium of the Supreme Court needed further inputs about the suitability of the two officers for elevation as High Court judges. On 6th March 2024, the Chief Justice of the High Court individually addressed a letter to the Supreme Court Collegium on the suitability of the petitioners. This is projected to be in full compliance of the resolution dated 4th January, 2024 of the Supreme Court Collegium.
