I, therefore, proceed on the assumption that this appeal also remains alive for active consideration, along with the other four appeals. 3. A crucial aspect to be kept in mind while considering these cases is that all the appellants are members of the police force and the allegation against them is of misuse and abuse of their powers, in resorting to custodial torture of Shama @ Kalya, s/o Nanu Ukey, and tampering with evidence. This ultimately resulted in registration of Crime No. 315 of 1995 for offences punishable under Sections 302, 330, 331, 342, 343, 348, 354, 385, 387, 201, 202, 193 and 218, all read with Section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). The appellants in these appeals are Accused Nos. 1 to 7. Sudhir, s/o Rambhan Kayarkar, and Ganesh, s/o Raghuji Turkar, Accused Nos. 8 and 9, were acquitted by the Trial Court of charges under Sections 201 and 202 IPC, read with Section 34 IPC, and the same attained finality. 4. Details of the conviction and sentencing of Accused Nos. 2 to 7 having been set out at length by my learned brother, there is no need to replicate the same except to the extent of adding that Accused No. 1, Manik, the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 1614 of 2012, was also convicted by the Trial Court for offences punishable under Section 304 Part II, 330, 331, 348, 387, 201 and 218 IPC, all read with Section 34 IPC, and he stood acquitted, along with the other accused, of offences punishable under Sections 302 and 354 IPC, both read with Section 34 IPC. Thereafter, in appeal, the High Court held that the prosecution had failed to prove the offence punishable under Section 201 IPC, read with Section 34 IPC, in so far as it related to causing disappearance of the body of Shama and all the appellants stood absolved of the same. 756 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 5. It may be noted that Vishwanath and Dilip, Accused Nos. 6 and 7, who jointly filed Criminal Appeal No. 1615 of 2012, already served out their sentence and were released from prison. This aspect was noted by this Court on 05.10.2012, while granting leave in these five cases. Further, it was noted that Manohar, Accused No. 3, had undergone imprisonment for about 1 year and 10 months out of the sentence of 3 years, while Vishnu, Accused No. 5, had completed about 1 year imprisonment out of a similar sentence of 3 years. As regards Manik, Ravindra and Hansraj, Accused Nos. 1, 2 and 4, it was noted that they had undergone only 2 years out of the sentence of 7 years imprisonment. In such circumstances, bail was granted only to Manohar and Vishnu, Accused Nos. 3 and 5, and not to the other three accused/appellants. It was only on 16.02.2015, that these three accused/appellants were also granted bail, taking note of the fact that they had completed approximately 5 years in jail.
