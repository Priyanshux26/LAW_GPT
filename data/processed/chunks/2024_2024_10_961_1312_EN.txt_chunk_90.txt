[…]” (b) Constituents of manifest arbitrariness 213. The test of ‘manifest arbitrariness’ itself was crystallized in the authoritative precedent set out in Shayara Bano v. Union of India (supra), where this Court dealt with the challenge to the practice of ‘triple talaq’ as recognized in the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937. In that case, this Court over-ruled its previous decision in State of AP v. McDowell & Co.,160 wherein it held that an enactment cannot be struck down on the grounds of it being arbitrary or unreasonable and that some constitutional infirmity has to be found before invalidating an Act. 214. Thus, the test of ‘manifest arbitrariness’ was set out in Shayara Bano (supra) as follows: 158 E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu (1974) 4 SCC 3 159 Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) 1 SCC 248, para 7. 160 State of Andhra Pradesh v. McDowell & Co. (1996) 3 SCC 709 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1091 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 "101. […] Manifest arbitrariness, therefore, must be something done by the legislature capriciously, irrationally and/or without adequate determining principle. Also, when something is done which is excessive and disproportionate, such legislation would be manifestly arbitrary.” [Emphasis supplied] 215. The test of ‘manifest arbitrariness, as propounded in Shayara Bano (supra), was eventually relied on in a catena of decisions including Joseph Shine v. Union of India,161 and is the prevailing law on this issue. (c) Facets of the test of manifest arbitrariness 216. The term ‘irrationality’ refers to the lack of reason or logic. While highlighting the need for the presence of clear reason or logic, this Court in Cellular Operators Assn. of India v. TRAI,162 determined that the legislation, statute or provision being challenged must be supported by a rationale. The rationale demonstrates the application of intelligent care and observation in the enactment of such laws or provisions. To this end, it was held that: "48. (…) We cannot forget that when viewed from the angle of manifest arbitrariness or reasonable restriction, sounding in Article 14 and Article 19(1)(g) respectively, the Regulation must, in to pass constitutional muster, be as a result of intelligent care and deliberation, that is, the choice of a course which reason dictates. Any arbitrary invasion of a fundamental right cannot be said to contain this quality. (…)” [Emphasis applied] 217. Further, in Joseph Shine (supra), this Court emphasized the underlying logic while striking down the provision prohibiting adultery: "30. [...] The offence and the deeming definition of an aggrieved person, as we find, is absolutely and manifestly 161 Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2019) 3 SCC 39 162 Cellular Operators Assn. of India v. TRAI (2016) 7 SCC 703 1092 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports arbitrary as it does not even appear to be rational and it can be stated with emphasis that it confers a licence on the husband to deal with the wife as he likes which is extremely excessive and disproportionate.
