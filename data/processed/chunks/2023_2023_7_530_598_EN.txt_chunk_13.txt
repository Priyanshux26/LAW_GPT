The view formed by the revenue in the present case for the assessment year 1995-96 has been scrutinized not only by the appellate tribunal but also by the Division Bench of this Court B and the same has been found to be correct.” 16. The court found that there was no patent error. The fact that for the same assessee but for the different assessment year, the same Bench of the ITAT had accepted their plea of short supply of bitumen as it was not within its knowledge as to whether the case travelled in appeal C before the High Court or not, whereas the decision rendered by the Tribunal for the assessment year 1995-96 had “travelled upto this Court in M.A. 214 OF 2002”. It is against the dated 05.03.2009 in M.A. 214 of 2002 and the dated 18.12.2017 in the Review Petition 102 of 2009 that the appellant is before this Court. D B. SUBMISSIONS OF PARTIES 17. The Court heard Shri Ramesh P. Bhat, learned Senior Advocate on behalf of the appellant and Shri N. Venkatraman, learned Additional Solicitor General on behalf of the Revenue. 18. Shri Ramesh P Bhat strenuously urged before us that impugned E s betray palpable errors. When the error was pointed out in Review though it is taken note of, the High Court has failed to rectify the fallacy. In short, the error on facts is as follows: “There are two assessment years involved namely 1995-96 and 1996-97. In the assessment year 1995-96, an addition was F made in a sum of Rs.20114659/- towards short delivery of bitumen which the appellant as carrier was obliged to transport and deliver to the Department in Bihar. In the assessment year 1996-97, likewise the appellant was multed with an addition in a sum of Rs.10471720/-.” G 19. It is pointed out that for the Assessment Year 1995-1996, as noticed earlier, by virtue of the of Rectification dated 31.05.2001, on the basis of which, the Appeal filed by the Revenue, was dismissed by the ITAT and Appeal filed by the appellant, against which, came to be dismissed, the matter was to be considered by the Assessing Officer. The same Tribunal, on the same day, i.e., 11.01.2002, on the H 548 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A other hand, allowed the Appeal of the Revenue and set aside the dated 18.12.2000, by which, the Commissioner Appeals had ed the deletion based on the alleged non-delivery of bitumen. In fact, it is pointed out that the High Court notes in the dated 05.03.2009, as if the Appeal was filed by the appellant against the Assessment Year 1995- 1996. Even when the conflicting views taken by the Tribunal was pointed B out in the Review Petition, despite noticing the argument, the High Court has rejected the same without just cause. In the , it is pointed out that the Court observed that the matter for the year 1995-1996 had travelled to the Court in M.A. 214 of 2012, when it actually related to 1996-1997.More importantly, the learned Senior Counsel would contend C that bitumen cannot be treated as other valuable article within the meaning of Section 69A of the Act.
