38 For short, SARFAESI Act’. IDBI (THROUGH STRESSED ASSETS STABILIZATION FUND 1081 CONSTITUTED BY THE GoI)v. SUPT. OF CENTRAL EXCISE AND CUSTOMS AND OTHERS [SANJIV KHANNA, J.] 26. In view of our reasoning, we must hold that the decision of the division bench of the Calcutta High Court in Dytron (India) Ltd.(supra) does not lay down the correct law and is, accordingly, overruled. The decision in Dytron (India) Ltd.(supra) was referred to in Sundaresh Bhatt, Liquidator of ABG Shipyard (supra), wherein this Court observed that reliance of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Dytron (India) Ltd.(supra) was not appropriate as such interpretation has been legislatively overruled by the inclusion of Section 142A in the Customs Act. We wish to clarify, as held above, that the decision in Dytron (India) Ltd.(supra) does not lay down the correct law, as even earlier, the position in law was that the debt ‘due and payable’, when it falls within the four corners of clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the Companies Act, would be treated as preferential payment, but it would not override and be given preference over the payments of overriding preferential creditors covered under Section 529A of the Companies Act. 27. We must also examine the decision of this Court in Imperial Chit Funds (P) Ltd. v. Income Tax Offi cer, Ernakulam39, wherein this Court has interpreted the legal eff ect of Section 178 of the Income Tax Act, 196140, which was enacted pursuant to the report of the Company Law Reforms Committee. On interpretation of Section 178 of the Income Tax Act, it was held that the provision is made applicable for any tax which is ‘then or is likely to become payable’, and specifi cally relates to cases where the company is in liquidation. Consequently, the amount specifi ed and covered by Section 178 of the Income Tax Act is protected in view of the non-obstante clause in sub-section (6) to Section 178 and this amount has to be set aside. In terms of Section 178 of the Income Tax Act, the amount set aside will not form a part of the pool of dues to be distributed among ordinary or unsecured creditors or, for that matter, as indicated over the overriding or preferential creditors under Sections 529A and 530 of the Companies Act. 28. In view of the aforesaid discussion and for the reasons stated, the present appeal is allowed and the impugned dated 26th August 2008 39 (1996) 8 SCC 303. 40 For short, ‘Income Tax Act’. 1082 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. in Original Side Appeal No. 1 of 2005 is set aside. Company Application No. 906 of 2004 fi led by the Offi cial Liquidator in Company Petition No. 168 of 2002 will be treated as allowed. The sale proceeds deposited in this Court and converted into fi xed deposit receipts, along with the interest accrued thereon, will be paid to the Offi cial Liquidator to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of Sections 529A and 530 of the Companies Act.
