• Whether the requirement to pass the award within the stipulated time frame of one year or as the case maybe, two years from the date of commencement (i.e. 01.08.1987) of the Amending Act, 1987 as contemplated by sub-section (3) of Section 60A of the RUI Act, as amended in 1990, is applicable to the compulsory acquisition made under Section 52(1) and (2) of RUI Act, after the extension of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 to the State of Rajasthan and the subsequent existing and repeal of RUI Actand provisions of Section 11A of the Central Act coming into play? • Whether the issuance of notification under Section 52(1) of the RUI Act is illegal and has been rightly quashed in the absence of non-compliance of mandatory requirements of Section 52(2) of the said Act? b) As regards the Nangli Kota lands, the learned counsel submitted that: • The compensation was supposed to be paid in terms of Section 60A(3) of the RUI Act, as amended. The State [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1017 Urban Improvement Trust v. Smt. Vidhya Devi and Ors. Government and the appellant neither determined the amount of compensation in terms of Section 52(7) of the RUI Act nor did they pass an award in terms of Section 60A(3). Further, the deposit of 80% of the estimated amount of compensation was supposed to be within a period of six months as per Section 60A(4) but deposition of compensation in the reference court was done only in 1997. • The appellant relied on an undated and unsigned draft agreement which, even though was offered by the respondents themselves for fixing compensation at Rs. 90,000/- for all of the Nangli Kota lands under acquisition, was never acted upon by the appellant. Therefore, the same cannot be taken advantage of for fixing compensation in the year 1997. • Further, the State Government and the appellant Trust had no intention to pay compensation for the parcels of the Nangli Kota lands, the nature and ownership of which was under challenge before the revenue authorities. It was contended that the draft agreement was not accepted by the Government because of the parallel proceedings initiated by it before the revenue authorities claiming it to be Government land. This led to lapsing of the time-period provided in the new law for the payment of compensation. • Therefore, a fresh notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was issued in 1990 and published in the official gazette in 1992, however, no notification under Section 6 thereof was ever made. The respondents submitted that the counsels for the appellant Trust stated that acquisition proceedings begun in 1977 for the Nangli Kota land had lapsed as it was superseded by the notification issued later in 1990 which also ultimately lapsed as it was not taken to its logical conclusion. This position has been recorded by the division bench of the High Court in the impugned . c) As regards the Moongaska land, the learned counsel submitted that: 1018 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
