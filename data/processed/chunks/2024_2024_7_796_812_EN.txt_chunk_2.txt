The challenge in the writ petitions and the LPA before the Division Bench was to the second part of the said Resolution quoted above whereby “Tanti-Tantwa” caste was sought to be merged with Entry-20 of the Scheduled Castes list namely, the caste of 'Pan/Sawasi' and to extend all benefits of the Scheduled Castes. 800 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 5. The challenge was mainly on the ground that the State Government had no competence/authority/power to add a caste or sub-caste to any entry in the Scheduled Castes list notified under the Presidential under Article 341 of the Constitution of India. Once the list under the Presidential is published, thereafter, any amendment, addition, deletion or modification to the said list can be made only by law enacted by Parliament and not otherwise. Before the High Court, the respondent-State of Bihar as also other private respondents took up a plea that the impugned Notification dated 01.07.2015 does not meddle with the Presidential and the list published thereunder but, in fact, it was only that “Tanti-Tantwa” were one and the same as 'Pan/Sawasi' except that they had the special title within the caste of 'Pan/Sawasi' and were being referred to as “Tanti-Tantwa” in the State of Bihar and, therefore, it was not a case of alteration of the list but only of clarification. It was also submitted by the respondents before the High Court that the State Government was bound by the recommendations made by the State Backward Commission and had, therefore, rightly deleted “Tanti-Tantwa” from the list of Extremely Backward Classes and merged with the Entry-20 of 'Pan/Sawasi' in the list of Scheduled Castes published in 1976. 6. The High Court accepted the submissions of the respondents, as noted above and, accordingly, dismissed the writ petitions as also the LPA, filed by the appellants vide impugned dated 03.04.2017. 7. It is this of the High Court dated 3rd April, 2017 which is under challenge in the present two appeals. 8. We have heard Smt. Indira Jai Singh, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants in both the appeals, Sri Ranjeet Kumar, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent-State of Bihar, Sri Salman Khurshid, Sri Rakesh Dwivedi and Sri V. Giri, learned Senior Counsel for the intervenors and Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General for the Union of India.
