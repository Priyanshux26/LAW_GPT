The Khalsa College, Amritsar has, over a period of time, become a significant icon of Khalsa Heritage and the University established in 2016 is likely to shadow and damage its character and pristine glory. Therefore, the Act ibid is proposed to be repealed.” 21. The Impugned Act, which consists of three sections, reads thus: “Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Punjab in the Sixty-eight year of the Republic of India as follows: - 1. (1) This Act may be called the Khalsa University (Repeal) Act, 2017. (2) It shall be deemed to have come into force with effect from the 30th day of May, 2017. 2. The Khalsa University Act, 2016 (Punjab Act No.44 of 2016), is hereby repealed: - Provided that admission to the affected students shall be given in other appropriate educational institutions of the 456 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports State of Punjab as per their eligibility, so that the interests of the students are not prejudicially affected. 3. The Khalsa University (Repeal) Ordinance, 2017 (Punjab Ordinance No. l of 2017), is also hereby repealed.” 22. It is thus clear that by the 2016 Act under the 2010 Policy of the State Government, Khalsa University was established as one of the private universities. The Impugned Act has been enacted with the sole purpose of repealing the 2016 Act by which the Khalsa University was established. It is also clear that the Impugned Act deals with only a single entity/institution i.e. the Khalsa University. 23. At the outset, we clarify that we do not propose to go into the question with regard to the allegation of mala fides attributed to any individual involved in the passing of the Impugned Act. In fact, the former Chief Minister of Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh was arrayed as respondent No.2 in the present appeal, however, by an dated 8th August 2018, the name of Captain Amarinder Singh was deleted. Be that as it may, for the purpose of the present appeal, we propose to examine only two questions. 24. The first question is, whether an enactment for giving out a differential treatment to a single entity is valid in law or not and secondly, whether the Impugned Act is liable to be struck down on the ground of manifest arbitrariness. A. Whether an enactment for giving out a differential treatment to a single entity is valid in law or not? 25. For considering the first issue, we propose to examine certain landmark s of this Court on the issue. 26. In the case of Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri v. The Union of India and Others,11 the Constitution Bench of this Court was faced with a situation where the Governor General of India had promulgated an Ordinance on the basis of a finding that, on account of mismanagement and neglect, a situation had arisen concerning the affairs of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd.12 which had not only prejudicially affected the production of an essential commodity but 11 [1950] 1 SCR 869 : 1950 INSC 36 12 Hereinafter referred to as “Sholapur Mill” [2024] 10 S.C.R.
