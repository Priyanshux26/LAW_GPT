The relevant observations are as follows: “23. The provisions of SICA 1985 impose an obligation on the sick industrial companies and potentially sick industrial companies to make references to BIFR within the time specified under SICA 1985. Default thereof is punishable under the provisions of SICA 1985. Largely, the proceedings before BIFR are specific to rehabilitation or winding up of 362 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the sick company and SICA 1985 hardly contemplates adversarial proceedings. The bodies constituted under SICA 1985 would least exercise their jurisdiction to a lis between any party or upon the rival interests of the parties. xxx xxx xxx 30. Dealing with the language of Section 22 of SICA 1985, this Court in Jay Engg. case [(2006) 8 SCC 677 : AIR 2006 SC 3252] took the view that the said Act shall prevail and though the adjudicatory process of making an award under the 1993 Act would not come under the purview of SICA 1985, once an award is made and sought to be executed, the provisions of Section 22 of SICA 1985 shall take over and such award would not be executable against the sick company, particularly when the party in whose favour the award was made was, as in the present case, included in the category of dormant creditors of the sick company. xxx xxx xxx 48. All these provisions which fall under Chapter III of SICA 1985 have to be read conjointly and that too, along with other relevant provisions and the scheme of SICA 1985. It is a settled canon of interpretation of statutes that the statute should not (sic) be construed in its entirety and a sub-section or a section therein should not be read and construed in isolation. Chapter III, in fact, is the soul and essence of SICA 1985 and it provides for the methodology that is to be adopted for the purposes of detecting, reviving or even winding up a sick industrial company. Provisions under SICA 1985 also provide for an appeal against the s of BIFR before another specialised body i.e. Aaifr. To put it simply, this is a self-contained code and because of the non obstante provisions, contained therein, it has an overriding effect over the other laws. As per Section 32 of SICA 1985, the Act is required to be enforced with all its vigour and in precedence to other laws. xxx xxx xxx 54. Firstly, the facts of these cases are different and distinct and, therefore, conclusions of the Court have to be read [2024] 5 S.C.R. 363 Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v. M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited with reference to the facts of the respective cases only and not dehors thereof. Once the dictum of this Court is read with reference to the facts of the respective cases, it would be evident that there is no conflict of views within the ambit of ratio decidendi of the respective s to make both of them legal and binding precedents.
