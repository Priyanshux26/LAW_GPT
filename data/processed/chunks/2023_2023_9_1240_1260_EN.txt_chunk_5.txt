File be consigned to record room after due compliance.” C h) Faced with the repudiation, which is dated 15.10.2009, the Claimant, desperate to indemnify himself and get the fruits of his insurance policy, filed a fresh complaint being C.C. No. 134 of 2012. In the said complaint, the appellant averred that, after filing the earlier complaint, since the counsel for the opposite party viz., the Insurance D Company took numerous dates for arguments on one pretext or the other, his counsel got annoyed with the attitude of the said Advocate and, by mistake, withdrew the case on 22.11.2020. It was expressly pleaded that the withdrawal of the said complaint was unfortunate, and that the appellant should not be made to suffer for the wrong deeds of the counsel. In the complaint, the appellant prayed for a direction to the E Insurance Company to pay the insured an amount of Rs.8,40,000 with interest @ 18% p.a. and further prayed for an amount of Rs.20,000/- on account of mental agony, delay and harassment. i)The Insurance Company, in its reply, objected to the maintainability of the present complaint in view of the earlier proceedings F in CPA No. 515 of 2009. It also contended that the terms and conditions of the insurance policy were violated. Apart from this, the plea of limitation was also taken. j)The objections were overruled by the District Forum. The plea of the complaint, being barred by limitation, was addressed by recording G a finding that the delay, if any, was already condoned, by the Forum, by dated 06.03.2012 under Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act. The plea about violation of the conditions of the policy was overruled and on non-standard basis, a sum to the extent of 75% of the sum assured was awarded. No finding was recorded on the aspect of the bar in filing H 1248 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A the present complaint after the dated 22.11.2010 dismissing CPA No. 515 of 2009 as withdrawn. The Insurance Company carried the matter in Appeal to the State Commission. k) Before the State Commission, only two contentions were urged. There was no contention raised on the issue of the withdrawal of the B earlier complaint. It was contended that the intimation of the theft was given to the Insurance Company only on 02.07.2008 i.e., six days after the theft, therefore it was argued that Condition No.1 of the insurance policy was violated. Apart from this, violation of Condition Nos. 5 of the policy was also argued. Their point about the delay of six days in intimation was brushed aside by referring to the Circular Ref: IRDA/ HLTH/ MISC/ C CIR/ 216/ 09/ 2011 dated September 20th, 2011 issued by Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (for short “IRDA”), which stated that even if there was a condition in the policy regarding delay in intimation, the insurer cannot take it’s shelter to repudiate the claim, which is otherwise proved to be genuine. D l)To appreciate the State Commission’s finding with regard to violations of the conditions of the policy, it is necessary to extract Condition Nos.
