PW-4 Sulaiman deposed to having seen the deceased with the said F appellants, early morning on 09.10.1999. He claims to having informed the boy’s father, PW-1 about this fact, after discovery of the body, on 12.10.1999. PW-5’s deposition seeks to corroborate that of PW-4. This witness also claimed to having seen the boy on the morning of 09.10.1999. However, intriguingly, despite noticing him in the company of two accused G and despite having heard a cry from the boy, this witness did not look back. In terms of his admission, PW-5 is a cousin of PW-1. Therefore, his behavior in not interceding upon seeing the boy in the company of the accused, early morning, away from his house – given that the boy was only 7 years, is unnatural. It is also unnatural that since the prosecution- and PW-1’s allegation is that the accused had a previous enmity with H 978 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A him, PW-5, a close relative, was neither surprised nor did anything to intervene when he saw the boy in the company of the first two appellants. Another important aspect is that the police statement of PW-5 was recorded more than two months after the start of investigation; even the application under Section 156 (3) Cr. PC does not mention that he had witnessed the boy with the accused despite the witness’s statement that B he informed PW-1, the boy’s father on 12.10.1999 about what he saw on 9.10.1999. 19. PW-4 Sulaiman deposed that his house was 8-10 paces to the north of Bisarat’s house, and that he was in his house the whole of the night of 8th October, 1999. He also deposed to going out in the morning C of 09-10-1999 to answer the call of nature, at around 6 AM when he noticed that the deceased was with Jakir and Jabir, the first two appellants. In cross examination, he admitted to not going out of his house on 9th October, 1999. He also deposed to having not been in the village when the boy’s body was found. Interestingly, in his cross examination, he stated that: D “I did not show the place to the IO at which the accused Jabir and Jakir were standing with Haseen, on the other hand I told to the IO that the accused were standing in the field of Yaqoob with Haseen. The accused Jabir and Jakir were standing in the northern side of the field of the field E of Yaqoob.” This statement renders PW-4’s testimony unreliable, because Yaqoob’s field was located at Narayanpur. PW-4 was a resident of Akbarpur; if he went out to answer the call of nature, at 6 AM or so in the morning, and returned home immediately, there is no explanation F how he knew that the accused were standing at a specific spot, in another village, Narayanpur, with the deceased. Besides this glaring discrepancy, it is unnatural and improbable, that one as close a neighbour of PW-1 living 8-10 paces away would not be aware that the boy went missing on 8th October, 1999.
