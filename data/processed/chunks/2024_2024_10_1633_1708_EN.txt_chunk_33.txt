Although, Section 147 is part of a taxing statute, it imposes no charge on the subject but deals merely with the machinery of assessment and in interpreting a provision of that kind, the rule is that construction should be preferred which makes the machinery workable. Since the proceedings under Section 147 of the Act are for the benefit of the Revenue and not an assessee and are aimed at gathering the ‘escaped income’ of an assessee, the same cannot be allowed to be converted as ‘revisional’ or ‘review’ proceedings at the instance of the assessee, thereby making the machinery unworkable.” iv. Principle of harmonious construction 39. The legislature is presumed to enact a consistent and harmonious body of laws in deference to the rule of law.90 In case of any apparent conflict within a provision or between two provisions of the same statute, the courts must read the provisions harmoniously.91 The principle of harmonious construction requires courts to bring about a reconciliation between seemingly conflicting provisions to give effect to both. An interpretation which reduces one of the provisions to a “dead letter” is not a harmonious construction. The principle of harmonious construction also applies to reconcile two seemingly conflicting provisions of different statutes.92 86 Gursahai Saigal v. CIT (1963) 48 ITR (SC) 1 [9] 87 CIT v. Mahaliram Ramjidas, AIR 1940 PC 124 88 Gursahai Saigal (supra) [13] 89 [1992] Supp. 1 SCR 732 : (1992) 4 SCC 363 [40] 90 MCD v. Shiv Shankar (1971) 1 SCC 442 [5] 91 Sultana Begum v. Prem Chand Jain (1997) 1 SCC 373 [15] 92 In re: Interplay between Arbitration Agreements under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 and the Indian Stamp Act 1899, 2023 INSC 1066 [165] 1674 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 40. A legislature often appends a non obstante clause to a provision to give it an overriding effect over provisions contained in the same statute or a separate statute.93 The purpose of incorporating a non obstante clause in a provision is to prohibit the operation and effect of all contrary provisions.94 In Chandavarkar Sita Ratna Rao v. Ashalata S Guram,95 Justice Sabyasachi Mukharji (as the learned Chief Justice then was) explained the purpose of a non obstante clause thus: “67. A clause beginning with the expression “notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in some particular provision in the Act or in some particular Act or in any law for the time being in force, or in any contract” is more often than not appended to a section in the beginning with a view to give the enacting part of the section in case of conflict an overriding effect over the provision of the Act or the contract mentioned in the non obstante clause. It is equivalent to saying that in spite of the provision of the Act or any other Act mentioned in the non obstante clause or any contract or document mentioned the enactment following it will have its full operation or that the provisions embraced in the non obstante clause would not be an impediment for an operation of the enactment.” 41.
