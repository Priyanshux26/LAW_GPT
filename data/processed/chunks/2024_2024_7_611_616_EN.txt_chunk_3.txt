Section 21 of the Land Reforms Act bars the jurisdiction of Civil Courts only in specific circumstances: (a) suits for specific performance of a contract for transfer of land, and (b) questioning the validity of any proceeding or taken or made under the Act. The present suit does not fall under either of these two categories. The appellants’ suit was essentially for a declaration that the land belonged to the religious and charitable shrine Dam Dama Sahib, and there was no challenge to the validity of any under the Act. The Civil Court alone has the jurisdiction to decide and declare whether the land belonged to the religious shrine or to Tikka Devinder Singh in his personal capacity. The suit filed by the appellants was not a challenge to the validity of the surplus but a suit for declaration regarding the ownership of the land. 616 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
