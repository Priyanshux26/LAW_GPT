Renewal of policy beyond 07.07.2009 onwards was refused relying upon the guidelines issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority vide D communication dated March 31, 2009.

The rejection of the claim on the ground that there was concealment of certain material facts by the appellant at the time of purchase of policy, was not found to be tenable and the insurance company was directed to reimburse the expenses incurred for the period from 07.07.2007 F to 06.07.2009. The said amount was paid by the insurance company. The passed by the National Commission was not challenged any further by the Insurance Company.
