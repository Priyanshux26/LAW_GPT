[Paras 14-16, 25-27 and 30] Appeal against acquittal – Exercise of appellate powers by High Court: Held: High Court, in exercise of appellate powers, may re-appreciate the entire evidence – However, reversal of an of acquittal is not to be based on mere existence of a different view or a mere difference of opinion – To permit so would be in violation of the two views theory – In to reverse an of acquittal in appeal, it is essential to arrive at a finding that the of the Trial Court was perverse or illegal; or that the Trial Court did not fully appreciate the evidence on record; or that the view of the Trial Court was not a possible view. [Para 25] Evidence – Extra judicial confession – Standard of proof: Held: The standard required for proving an extra judicial confession to the satisfaction of the Court is on the higher side and the essential ingredients must be established beyond any reasonable doubt – The standard becomes even higher when the entire case of the prosecution necessarily rests on the extra judicial confession. [Para 15] Evidence – Circumstantial evidence – “Panchsheel” Principles: [2024] 2 S.C.R. 393 Kalinga @ Kushal v. State of Karnataka By Police Inspector Hubli Held: Essentially, circumstantial evidence comes into picture when there is absence of direct evidence – For proving a case on the basis of circumstantial evidence, it must be established that the chain of circumstances is complete – It must also be established that the chain of circumstances is consistent with the only conclusion of guilt – The margin of error in a case based on circumstantial evidence is minimal – For, the chain of circumstantial evidence is essentially meant to enable the court in drawing an inference – The task of fixing criminal liability upon a person on the strength of an inference must be approached with abundant caution. [Para 27] Criminal Law – Minor inconsistencies vis-à-vis reasonable doubt – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Plea of the respondent-State that minor inconsistencies could not be construed as reasonable doubts for ing acquittal: Held: No doubt, it is trite law that a reasonable doubt is essentially a serious doubt in the case of the prosecution and minor inconsistencies are not to be elevated to the status of a reasonable doubt – A reasonable doubt is one which renders the possibility of guilt as highly doubtful – Purpose of criminal trial is not only to ensure that an innocent person is not punished, but it is also to ensure that the guilty does not escape unpunished – In the present case, the inconsistencies in the case of the prosecution are not minor inconsistencies – Prosecution miserably failed to establish a coherent chain of circumstances – The present case does not fall in the category of a light-hearted acquittal, which is shunned upon in law.
