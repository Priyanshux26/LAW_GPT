The Court, vide its in State of Bihar v Madhu Kant Ranjan, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1262, also took the view that ‘ As per the settled proposition of law, a candidate/applicant has to comply with all the conditions/eligibility criteria as per the advertisement before the cut-off date mentioned therein unless extended by the recruiting authority. 18. In the above analysis, though the Court is not required to go into the question of equivalence apropos the C.C.C. Certifi cate, but since contentions thereon were argued, we may reiterate that the advertisement clearly specifi ed the essential qualifi cation was a C.C.C. Certifi cate. The appellants despite opportunity to appear to show such equivalence, having failed to do so, nothing survives on this count. 19. Having considered the matter in toto, the appeal, being devoid of merit, stands dismissed. The Impugned is upheld. SUDHIR SINGH AND OTHERS v. STATE OF U.P. 143 AND OTHERS [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] 20. However, any payments made to the appellants for the period they have actually worked as Village Development Offi cers, shall not be recovered. If any such recoveries have already been eff ected, the same be returned to the appellants forthwith. 21. No as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal dismissed. Divya Pandey
