We must also hasten to add that during the hearing of the abovementioned review applications, the Additional D Chief Revenue Commissioner tendered an apology via an affidavit stating that he had no knowledge that the High Court had already decided the pending writ petitions through its dated 07.10.2005. 22.Again for ease of analysis, the key events in these proceedings are summarised as follows – E F G H STATE OF UTTARAKHAND AND ANR. v. RAVI KUMAR 955 (DECEASED) THROUGH LRS AND OTHERS [SURYA KANT, J.] A B C A.3 THE RESPONDENTS’ 1983 INJUNCTION SUIT PROCEEDINGS: CIVIL APPEAL NO 4988 OF 2009 AND CIVIL APPEAL NO 4984 OF 2009 23.The cause for the inception of these appeals arose when the D Commissioner dismissed the revision against the Expunction as non-maintainable. Because of the said dismissal, the Respondents apprehended that the revenue entries in their favour would be struck off, and accordingly, they filed a suit praying for perpetual injunction restraining the Appellants from evicting the Respondents from the Suit E Land as well as a mandatory injunction directing the Appellants to refrain from deleting or restoring the revenue entries in their favour. 24. The Trial Court decreed the said suit in favour of the Respondents vide its dated 20.10.1984. The Trial Court made extensive reference to 1967 Eviction Suit proceedings and 1978 Mutation F Proceedings to hold that Respondents became ‘Sirdar’ and later on ‘Bhumidhar’ legally and that Appellants have no claim of title over the Suit Land. The Appellants filed an appeal against the dated 20.10.1984, which was dismissed by the First Appellate Court on 16.06.1986 on identical reasoning as given by the Trial Court. The First Appellate Court again highlighted the factum of longstanding revenue G entries in favour of Respondents and the continued possession with them to uphold the of the Trial Court. It also observed that the dispute in respect of the revenue entries should have been adjudicated by the competent revenue court instead of being decided by the Collector vide the Expunction . H 956 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 25. The Appellants proceeded to file the second appeal before the High Court against the First Appellate Court’s , and the same was dismissed vide the impugned dated 05.11.2004 passed in Civil Appeal No 4988 of 2009. While dismissing the second appeal, the High Court noted that the suit was filed within limitation and that the courts below have rightly held that Respondents have lawfully acquired B the status of ‘Sirdar’ and later on that of ‘Bhumidhar’. Against the said dated 05.11.2004, the Appellants preferred a review petition, but the same was dismissed vide the impugned judgement dated 28.07.2005 in Civil Appeal No 4984 of 2009 on identical reasoning. 26.We again proceed to summarise the litigation history in a tabular C format as follows – D E A.4 THE 1982 LAND ACQUISITION PROCEEDINGS: CIVIL APPEAL(S) NO. 4989-4992 OF 2009 F 27.The commencement point for these appeals began when the state authorities issued a notification dated 13.04.1982 under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 for acquiring land measuring 70 bigha 08 biswa for the construction of Model Industrial Training Institute.
