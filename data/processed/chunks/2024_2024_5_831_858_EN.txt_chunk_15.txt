declaration, objections play a vital road. In Kamal Trading (P) Ltd. v. State of W.B.

Digital Supreme Court Reports (iii) The decision of compulsory acquisition of land is subject to judicial review and the Court will examine and determine whether the acquisition is related to public purpose. If the court arrives at a conclusion that that there is no public purpose involved in the acquisition, the entire process can be set-aside. This Court has time and again reiterated the importance of the underlying objective of acquisition of land by the State to be for a public purpose17. 30.5. The Right of restitution or fair compensation: (i) A person’s right to hold and enjoy property is an integral part to the constitutional right under Article 300A. Deprivation or extinguishment of that right is permissible only upon restitution, be it in the form of monetary compensation, rehabilitation or other similar means. Compensation has always been considered to be an integral part of the process of acquisition. (ii) Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Sections 8 and 9 of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952, Section 23 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, and Sections 3G and 3H of the National Highways Act, 1956 are the statutory incorporations of the right to restitute a person whose land has been compulsorily acquired. (iii) Our courts have not only considered that compensation is necessary, but have also held that a fair and reasonable compensation is the sine qua non for any acquisition process18. 17 In Somawanti v. State of Punjab, 1962 SCC OnLine SC 23, this Court held that the Constitution permits acquisition of private land by the State only for a public purpose. The rationale of taking away private land by the State for a public purpose is that private interest must give way to public interest as observed by the Court in Daulat Singh Surana v. First Land Acquisition Collector (2007) 1 SCC 641. In Union of India v. Jaswant Rai Kochhar (1996) 3 SCC 491 and D. Hanumanth SA v. State of Karnataka (2010) 10 SCC 656, this Court held acquisition proceedings to be valid even if there was a change in the public purpose, so long as there is a public purpose for which the land is acquired.
