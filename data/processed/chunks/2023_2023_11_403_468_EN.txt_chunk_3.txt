Such person may not be a person summoned as a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept is that it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power can be exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court or revisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of the Courts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decision of the case. [Para 112] Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 307 – Double murder – Due to injuries caused by fi re arm – Appeal against acquittal. Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths were homicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution’s story to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which proved fatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statement given by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was later converted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as a dying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, even through the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence as given in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference against the accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice is taken of in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regarding the conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutor and the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is found to be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement of CW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who had caused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal for two out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third surviving injured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307 IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after due investigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayan of the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore, their acquittal is not disturbed.
