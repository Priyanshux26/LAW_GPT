As rightly submitted by the learned counsel for the respondents, in the letter daeted 12-8-2014, the appellants had stated to be not liable “Henceforth”, i.e. after the said letter was sent. The appellants therefore were bound by the acts/deeds of the Respondent No.2 carried out pursuant to the irrevocable Power of Attorney till it was terminated, in accordance with law. It is also not denied that the appellants have not taken any action whatsoever against the respondent No.2 with regard to the alleged non-compliance of the terms and conditions of JAV by the said Respondent. Under the circumstances, it does not lie in the mouth of the appellants to say that the appellants are not liable for the acts of Respondent No.2. 9. The ‘NCDRC’ having considered all the issues with regard to the joint liability of the appellants as well as the Respondent No.2, we do not find any good ground to interfere with the same. 10. In that view of the matter, the Appeals being devoid of merits and are dismissed. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
