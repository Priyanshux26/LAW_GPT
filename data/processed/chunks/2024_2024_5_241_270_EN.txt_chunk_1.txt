[Paras 16, 37, 31, 38] Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 – Rajasthan Stamp Act, 1998 – s.3 – Insurance policies issued between 1993-94 to 2001-02 – Stamp duty leviable under the 1952 Act or the 1998 Act: Held: Stamp duty must be levied as per the law in force as on the date of execution of the instrument – The charging provision i.e. s.3 of the 1998 Act, imposed stamp duty on every instrument mentioned in the Schedule that is executed in the state on or after the date of commencement of the Act – 1998 Act came into force only on 27.05.2004 – Hence, at the time that the relevant instruments were executed, the 1952 Act was still in force and the stamp duty was leviable under the same. [Para 8] Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 – ss.2, 3(v), (vi) – Application of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 – Adaptations – Schedule I of the 1899 Act – Rajasthan Stamp Rules, 1955 – rr.2 (d), 3 – Liability to pay stamp duty under the 1952 Act: Held: r.3, r/w r.2(d), provides that the stamps issued by the State government will indicate the payment of stamp duty chargeable on an instrument – Therefore, the stamp must be issued by and the stamp duty must be paid to the State government for an instrument to be ‘duly stamped’ under the 1952 Act – State has the power to collect stamp duty under s.3 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as adapted to the state of Rajasthan that provides that an instrument shall be chargeable with the duty of the amount indicated in the Schedule if it is executed within the state of Rajasthan – The mandate of s.3 is also found in r.3 that provides for “mode of payment” – r.3, read with r.2(d), provides that the duty with which any instrument is chargeable [2024] 5 S.C.R. 243 Life Insurance Corporation of India v. The State of Rajasthan and Ors. shall be paid by means of a stamp issued by the state government – The relevant event flowing from s.3 and r.3 authorising the levy and imposition of stamp duty is the execution of the policy of insurance within the state – The liability to purchase the stamps from the state of Rajasthan is therefore clear and unambiguous – Consequently, for instruments executed within the state, the purchase of stamps from outside the state will equate to evasion of stamp duty and the instrument will not be ‘duly stamped’. [Paras 22, 26] Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 – s.3A(1) – Appellant issued various insurance policies within the state of Rajasthan and was required to affix stamps by paying stamp duty on such policies – It wrote to the Collector, Jaipur regarding the non-availability of ‘Agents License Fee stamps’ – Plea of the appellant that in view of the letter of the Treasury Officer, Jaipur dated 07.10.1991 stating that ‘India Insurance Stamps’ are the property of the central government and their supply and distribution is not related to their department, they were compelled to purchase the stamps from Maharashtra, without which they could not have issued the insurance policies in the state of Rajasthan – High Court without taking note of the aforesaid letter held that the correspondence of the appellant with the department pertained to Agents License Fee stamps and even if the stamps were unavailable, the appellant was duty-bound to pay the stamp duty to the state government in cash as provided under s.3A(1) – Propriety: Held: High Court evidently did not take note of the letter dated 07.10.1991 – Further, it entirely failed to consider sub-section (4) which excludes instruments under Entry 91, List I from the application of s.3A – Therefore, the High Court also erred in holding that the appellant could have paid the stamp duty in cash – In view of the above circumstances, the appellant had no choice but to purchase the insurance stamps from outside the state – While it made every endeavour to purchase the stamp from within the state, due to the letter by the department and the lack of mechanism for payment of stamp duty under the 1952 Act in case of unavailability of insurance stamps, it was unable to purchase the stamps and pay the stamp duty to the Rajasthan government.
