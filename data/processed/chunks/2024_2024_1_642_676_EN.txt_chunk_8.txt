In the first appellate proceedings, CIT(A) took the view that the profit shown in the statement was for availing credit facility only and therefore set aside the reopening of assessment. Though the Tribunal concurred with the view of CIT(A), the department filed an appeal before the High Court. The assessing officer had compared the balance of the partners in their capital account in the firm in the said balance sheet (filed before the 654 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports bank) with capital in the balance sheet filed for the assessment year 1993 – 1994 and thereafter determined the probable escapement of income which is fully justified and rightly upheld by the High Court. 20.3. Respondent has contended that in the original assessments the assessing officer had made the assessments on the basis of limited information furnished by the assessee. The assessing officer made the reassessments on the basis of the increase in the capital in the balance sheets between the years ending 31.03.1989 and 31.03.1993. Respondent has denied that the reassessments were made on the basis of change of opinion. An audited balance sheet for the period ending 31.12.1984 was available with the department. Thereafter, no audited or unaudited balance sheets were furnished on the ground that books of account could not be maintained. However, an audited balance sheet for the period ending 31.03.1993 was furnished in the course of the assessment proceedings for the assessment year 1993 – 1994. Another balance sheet for the period ending 31.03.1989 which was claimed by the assessee to be an account prepared only for submission before the South Indian Bank for availing loan could be traced out. A perusal of the balance sheet for the assessment year 1993-1994 revealed that the increase in capital was not commensurate with the income assessed on estimation basis by the assessing officer for the assessment years 1989 – 1990 to 1992-1993. It was in view of such changed circumstances that notices under Section 148 were issued. The original assessments for the assessment years 1990 – 1991, 1991 – 1992 and 1992 – 1993 were completed on 29.01.1992, 29.01.1992 and 26.03.1993 respectively. The balance sheet for the assessment year 1993 – 1994 which was used as the basis for reassessment was not available with the assessing officer when the original assessments were made. Facts available with the assessing officer in the original assessments and in the reassessments were different. Since facts were different, question of any change in the opinion did not arise. In the circumstances respondent sought for dismissal of the special leave petitions since registered as civil appeals. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 655 M/S Mangalam Publications, Kottayam v.
