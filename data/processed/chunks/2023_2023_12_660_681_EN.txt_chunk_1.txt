Case No. 05 of 2010, has been dismissed. FACTS 2. The husband of the fi rst respondent was appointed as a Constable in the Railway Protection Special Force, a unit of the Railway Protection Force (in short, “the RPF”), on 27.12.2006. He died on 23.04.2008 in an accident in the course of his employment. On his death, the fi rst respondent along with other heirs of the deceased fi led a claim petition under the 1923 Act for compensation by claiming, inter alia, that on the date of his death, the deceased was aged 25 years and getting monthly wages of Rs. 8,000/-. The claim was resisted by the appellants, inter-alia, on the ground that the deceased was part of the Armed Forces of the Union and, therefore, not a workman; hence, the claim petition under the 1923 Act is not maintainable. 3.The Commissioner found that the relationship of workman-employer between the deceased and the non-claimant was admitted to the non- claimant; the deceased died in an accident in the course of his employment; and the deceased being a “Railway Servant”, as per the provisions of Section 2(34) of the Railways Act, 1989 (in short, the 1989 Act), would be deemed to be a “workman” under Section 2(1)(n)(i) of the 1923 Act and, therefore, the claim petition was maintainable.
