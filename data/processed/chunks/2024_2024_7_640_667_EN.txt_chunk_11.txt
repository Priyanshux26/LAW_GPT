After booking the case, the appellant (AO1) and AO2 imposed a fine of Rs.50,000/- but the fine receipt was issued in the name of an employee of the saw mill named M. Ashok. After 7 or 10 days, AO1 and AO2 again came to his saw-mill and demanded a monthly payment (mamool) of Rs.5,000/- threatening that if the amount was not paid, they would book repeated cases against him and dismantle his business. On 21st February, 2003, AO1 and AO2 rang up the complainant (PW-1) and demanded a bribe of Rs.5,000/- . AO2 also frequently called the complainant (PW-1) over mobile and harassed him in relation to the demand of Rs.5,000/-. Being perturbed by these persistent demands, the complainant (PW-1) went to the ACB Office on 22nd January, 2003 and submitted a complaint (Exhibit P-1) to the DySP (PW-10). The complainant (PW-1) was instructed by the DySP (PW-10) to come to the ACB office on 23rd January, 2003 along with the bribe amount of Rs.5,000/- which he intended to pay for getting the appellant (AO1) and AO2 trapped. On the same day, i.e. on 22nd January, 2003 in the evening, the complainant (PW-1) informed his friend Ramesh Naidu (PW-2) about lodging of the complaint and requested him to accompany him to the ACB office on the next day. The complainant (PW-1) alleged that in the morning of 23rd March, 2003, he received another phone call from the appellant (AO1) and AO2 and he was directed to come to the Quality-Inn Residency Hotel, Nampally along with the bribe amount of Rs.5,000/-. The complainant (PW-1) agreed and thereafter, he proceeded to the ACB office where PW-2 was already waiting for him. The DySP (PW-10), his staff along with mediators assembled in the ACB office. The DySP (PW-10) introduced the complainant (PW-1) to the mediators; pre-trap proceedings were undertaken; the mediators verified the currency notes presented by the complainant (PW-1) and noted the denomination and the serial numbers thereof in the pre-trap panchnama (Exhibit P-4). A white powder was applied to the currency notes. The DySP (PW-10) then requested PW-2 to act as an accompanying witness (shadow witness). He told the complainant(PW-1) and PW-2 to proceed to the Hotel Quality-Inn for paying the bribe amount to the appellant (AO1) and AO2 on their further demand and even otherwise. PW-2 was instructed to watch the sequence of events which would transpire between the complainant (PW-1) and the two accused (AO1 and AO2) and after transfer of the bribe amount, to give the pre-arranged 656 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports signal by wiping his hand with the handkerchief. The procedure of use of phenolphthalein powder was demonstrated in presence of the complainant (PW-1). After that, the complainant (PW-1) and PW-2 proceeded to the Hotel Quality-Inn and the DySP (PW-10) and other trap party members followed them from a distance. The complainant (PW-1) and PW-2 reached the Hotel Quality-Inn at about 10:30 am. The complainant (PW-1) parked his vehicle in the cellar of the hotel and then he, along with PW-2 went into the coffee shop and occupied a table.
