The dated 21 October 2022 was subsequently withdrawn on 24 December 2022. The dated 24 December 2022 D now clarifies that limitation would be computed with effect from the date of e-filing but a physical copy would have to be filed within seven days of e-filing. 23. In the present case, the was pronounced by the NCLT on 26 August 2022. Rule 3 of the NCLAT Rules 2016 stipulates that the date from which the period of limitation has to be reckoned (i.e., E the date of the pronouncement of the ) would have to be excluded. Hence, the date on which the was pronounced by the NCLT, namely 26 August 2022 would have to be excluded from the computation of limitation. This is in line with Section 12(1) of the Limitation Act 1963. As noted earlier, the provisions of the Limitation F Act 1963 are made applicable, inter alia, to appeals before the NCLAT by virtue of Section 238A of the IBC. Section 12(1) of the Limitation Act 1963 provides as follows: “12. Exclusion of time in legal proceedings— (1) In computing the period of limitation for any suit, appeal or G application, the day from which such period is to be reckoned, shall be excluded. […]” 24. Between 26 August 2022, when the was pronounced by the NCLT, and 10 October 2022, when the appeal was e-filed, a period H of 45 days elapsed after excluding the date on which the was SANKET KUMAR AGARWAL & ANR v. APG LOGISTICS PVT. 1173 LTD. [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] pronounced. The NCLAT has erroneously proceeded on the basis that A the appeal was lodged on the 46th day whereas correctly computed, the appeal was lodged on the 45th day. This is evident from the following table: B C 25. The power of condoning a delay of up to 15 days beyond the original period of 30 days lies within the discretionary power of the NCLAT. The appeal was instituted within the outer limit of 45 days. 26. Furthermore, in terms of Section 12(2) of the Limitation Act D 1963, the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the appealed from has to be excluded while computing the period of limitation. The Explanation to Section 12 clarifies that the time taken by the court to prepare an before an application for a copy thereof is made shall not be excluded. The relevant part of Section 12 provides as follows: E “12. Exclusion of time in legal proceedings.— (1) …. (2) In computing the period of limitation for an appeal or an application for leave to appeal or for revision or for review of a , the day on which the complained of was F pronounced and the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree, sentence or appealed from or sought to be revised or reviewed shall be excluded. (3) …. G (4) …. Explanation.— In computing under this section the time requisite for obtaining a copy of a decree or an , any time taken by the court to prepare the decree or before an application for a copy thereof is made shall not be excluded.” H 1174 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R.
