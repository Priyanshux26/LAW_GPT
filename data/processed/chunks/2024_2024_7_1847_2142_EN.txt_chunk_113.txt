2034 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 18.1 Based on the above contentions, the petitioners have sought that unless certain precautions are taken, the Union of India shall not release GMOs into the environment by way of import, manufacture, use or any other manner. More specifically, the petitioners have sought directions with regard to approval dated 25.10.2022 recommended by GEAC by clearing for environmental release transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 following fairly long stages of trial conducted by ICAR, CGMCP; Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh (IMTECH), NIN, Hyderabad, Amar Immunodiagnostics Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad and Premas Biotech Pvt. Ltd., Manesar. 18.2 It was submitted by learned Attorney General that by dated 10.05.2012 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.260 of 2005, this Court was pleased to appoint an expert committee (TEC) consisting of technical experts to submit a report with certain terms of reference. TEC submitted an interim report on 07.10.2012 and Union of India raised objections in response to the said report, which were referred to TEC on 09.11.2012. On 30.06.2013, the TEC submitted its final report making certain suggestions. According to the learned Attorney General, the TEC Report goes beyond the terms of reference, to the extreme extent of observing that HT crops are completely unsuitable in the Indian context. But, Dr. Paroda has filed a separate dissenting report raising serious objections to the procedures and deliberations of the TEC that virtually worked with a closed mind. 18.3 It was then submitted that these writ petitions were filed in 2004-2005 respectively and since then, there has been development in the regulatory framework governing the field and the following guidelines and protocols are applicable to the research and testing of GMOs: i. Guidelines and SOPs for Conduct of Confined Field Trials of Regulated GE Plants, 2008. ii. Revised Guidelines for Research in Transgenic Plants, 1998. iii. Guidelines for Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from GE plants, 2008 (updated in 2012). [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2035 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. iv. Protocols for Food and Feed Safety Assessment of GE Crops, 2008. v. Guidelines for the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of GE Plants, 2016. vi. Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of GE Plants: A Guide for Stakeholders, 2016. vii. Risk Analysis Framework, 2016. 18.4 The aforesaid regulatory framework has been developed after the filing of the present petitions and in view of these developments, these petitions have been rendered infructuous. That in view of the adequacy of the current regulatory regime in place, the petitions have lost their efficacy inasmuch there is no challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, rules or executive action and that a writ court cannot embark on a roving and fishing inquiry in a public interest litigation. 18.5 Emphasising that the focus of the writ petition is now confined to the environmental release of transgenic mustard DMH-11, it was submitted that on receipt of the application requesting a trial of DMH-11 to be conducted, approval was given by GEAC on 29.09.2010 and subsequently, approvals were granted to conduct BRL-I and BRL-II trials.
