The in the case of Prakash Dal Mill (supra) is of no help to the respondent. In the said case, for the same land the fi nal rate was fi xed belatedly. In the present case, the respondent itself had applied for change of use to hospitality on 23.07.2007 whereas in the Board meeting of 19.07.2007 the fi nal rates applicable had been fi xed. 27. Another argument advanced was with respect to the rate of Rs.3.2 Crores per acre being applicable to for a stray site available in the Electronic City being not applicable to the respondent is also without any merit. Once the respondent had made a request for change of use of the allotted plot from an IT sector industry to a Hospitality sector, it would amount to a fresh transaction and, therefore, the rate determined in the 141st Meeting would be fully applicable. 28. For all the reasons recorded above, we fi nd that the demand raised by the notice dated 25.07.2012 does not suff er from any infi rmity. The respondent is liable to pay the demand as per the said notice. Accordingly, 792 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. the appeal is allowed. The impugned s passed by the Division Bench and the Single Judge are set aside and the writ petition fi led by the respondent stands dismissed. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Nidhi Jain
