However, the application of law thereon would be the CrPC, 1973. While so, the CrPC, 1973 cannot be made applicable when the earlier one (i.e. CrPC, 1989) was still in force. 26. It is to be noted, that a mere non-compliance of an earlier procedure mentioned in the repealed Code by itself would not enure to the benefit of an accused, the procedure being a curable one, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case. To put it differently, apart from the question of prejudice, an investigating agency is not debarred from proceeding further after complying with the omission committed earlier, by taking recourse to the repealed Code i.e., CrPC, 1989. It is for this reason, that the , 2019 with specific reference to Para 2(13) has been introduced in exercise of the power conferred under Section 103 of the Act, 2019. 27. A similar issue was dealt with, way back in the year 1929 by the High Court of Calcutta in Nibaran Chandra v. Emperor, 1929 A.I.R. 1929 Calcutta 754. Considering the said issue, Justice Mukherjee had rightly found a way out by giving liberty to the prosecution to proceed afresh, under Section 196A of CrPC, 1898: “The petitioners have been convicted under S. 120-B, I.P.C. Petitioner 1 has also been convicted under S. 384, I.P.C. and No. 2 under S. 384/114, I.P.C. The ground upon which this rule has been issued is that the trial was vitiated as the sanction contemplated by S. 196- A, Criminal P.C. had not been accorded by the Local Government to the prosecution of the petitioners under S. 120-B, I.P.C. Now the object of the conspiracy having been to commit an offence under S. 384, I.P.C., which is a non-cognizable offence the Court could not take cognizance of the said offence without the sanction of the Local Government or of the District Magistrate empowered in that behalf. In the explanation which the learned Magistrate has submitted in answer to the rule he has suggested that the convictions under Ss. 384 and 384/114, I.P.C. as against the petitioners 1 and 2 respectively may be maintained and that the sentence passed on them may be treated as having been passed under the said sections. Apart from anything else, this [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1071 National Investigation Agency New Delhi v. Owais Amin @ Cherry & Ors. course, in my opinion, is likely to result in prejudice to the petitioners. They had been put on their trial in respect of offences under Ss. 384 and 384/114 along with a charge under S. 120-B. It is just possible and indeed it is not unlikely that a good deal of evidence that was adduced on behalf of the prosecution in this case in to establish the charge of conspiracy would not be relevant as against the petitioners on the substantive charges under Ss. 384 and 384/114, I.P.C. The trial held on charges which do not require sanction along with such as are not cognizable without sanction under S. 196-A, Criminal P. C., cannot be separated in this way.
