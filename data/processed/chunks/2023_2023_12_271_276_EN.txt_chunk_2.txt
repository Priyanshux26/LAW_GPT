Samples were collected during the course of the inspection of the trade effl uent. The observed values were found to be in breach of permissible limits prescribed under Schedule VI of the Environment (Protection) Rules 1986. 6. On 27 April 2004, the State Board informed the Commissioner of the Municipal Council that the slaughter house had not made arrangements for treatment and disposal of effl uents generated and the waste was being discharged without treatment. The Commissioner was directed to submit a feasibility report. On 13 September 2004, the Commissioner of the Municipal Council submitted an application for consent to operate under Sections 25/26 of the Act of 1974. On 21 September 2004, the Commissioner was called upon to show cause why the application for obtaining consent should not be refused. The State Board refused the application for consent by an dated 2 November 2004 on the ground that the Commissioner had failed to respond to the notice to show cause. The Commissioner thereafter submitted an application on 9 March 2005 for obtaining consent to operate under Sections 25/26 of the Act of 1974. On 2 May 2005, the State Board directed the Commissioner to submit certain information. Pursuant to it, the Commissioner responded on 6 June 2005. On 25 June 2005, the State Board approved the scheme for treatment of the trade effl uent subject to the condition that the prescribed norms would be achieved and proper arrangements would be made to utilize the treated water. 7. On 8 July 2005, the Commissioner requested the State Board to approve the design of the effl uent treatment plant for the treatment of the trade effl uent. On 11 August 2005, the State Board informed the Commissioner that it had already approved the scheme presented by the Commissioner. The Commissioner was however asked to intimate the action taken for the construction of an effl uent treatment plant. Another inspection was conducted on 30 November 2005 following which the State Board by its letter dated 30 PANCHAYAT QURESHIAN AND ANOTHER v. STATE OF RAJASTHAN 275 AND OTHERS [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] January 2006 refused consent to the slaughter house on the ground that the entire effl uent/waste water was being discharged on the nearby land without treatment. On 13 September 2007, an inspection was carried out which revealed that the effl uent treatment plant was incomplete and that untreated waste water was being discharged. Samples were collected during the course of the inspection indicating that the trade effl uent was beyond the prescribed polluting parameters. This was brought to the notice of the Commissioner of the Municipal Council on 27 October 2007. On 3 January 2008, it was found that the effl uent treatment plant was incomplete, as a result of which the trade effl uent was not being properly treated. 8.
