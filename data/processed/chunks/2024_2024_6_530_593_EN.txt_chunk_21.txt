However, in the absence of statutory Rule to deal with a particular issue, the High Courts are bound to give effect to the decisions of the Supreme Court. 13 [2003] Supp. 1 SCR 114 : (2003) 9 SCC 592 14 [2010] 2 SCR 239 : (2010) 2 SCC 637 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 561 Abhimeet Sinha & Ors. v. High Court of Judicature at Patna & Ors. iii) Likewise in Mahinder Kumar v High Court of Madhya Pradesh15 (for short “Mahinder Kumar”), the challenge was to the procedure adopted by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh for recruitment of District Judge (entry level). While discussing paragraph 10.97 of the Shetty Commission, the 3 judge Bench speaking through Justice FM Ibrahim Kalifulla, clarified as under: “71. Sub-paras (i) to (v) of Para 10.97 of the Shetty Commission Report have been set out to show how while holding a written examination and a viva voce examination, prescription of marks and other aspects are to be followed. In fact those sub-paragraphs, contained in Para 10.97 of the Shetty Commission Report, can at best be stated to be a guideline, which any High Court should keep in mind, while resorting to selection for filling up the posts in the Higher Judicial Service. In this context, in para 28 of All India Judges Assn. (3) [(2002) 4 SCC 247 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 508] , this Court while prescribing the extent to which direct recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service for the post of Higher Judicial Service for the District Judges can be made, also said that appropriate rules should be framed by the High Courts at the earliest possible time. Therefore, once the rules come into place it will have to held that what all that can be expected of the High Court, would be to follow the said rules. We have in this held that by virtue of Rule 7 and Para 9(iv), the 1st respondent High Court had every authority to prescribe the procedure, while making the selection to the post of Higher Judicial Service and that such procedure followed was also rational.” In the above paragraph, the Court specifically noted that the Shetty Commission recommendations can at best be considered a guideline and that the High Court is vested with the required power to evolve its own procedure for selection of judicial officers. We must reiterate that a reference was also made to paragraph 28 of All India Judges (2002) which provided for the 15 [2013] 13 SCR 884 : (2013) 11 SCC 87 562 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports High Court to frame appropriate Rules. Moreover, the Shetty Commission itself mentioned that the recommendation was subject to the prescription of Rules by the High Court. iv) In like manner, this Court in Sasidhar Reddy v State of AP16, observed that the recommendations of the Shetty Commission would have to be supported by the Rules for implementation. It was clarified that when recommendations and the Rules are at variance, the statutory Rules should be followed.
