249 Nipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors. with disabilities – They contribute to the negative self-image and perpetuate discriminatory attitudes and practices in society; (ii) Language that individualises the impairment and overlooks the disabling social barriers (e.g. terms such as “afflicted”, “suffering”, and “victim”) should be avoided or adequately flagged as contrary to the social model; (iii) Creators must check for accurate representation of a medical condition as much as possible – The misleading portrayal of what a condition such as night blindness entails may perpetuate misinformation about the condition, and entrench stereotypes about persons with such impairments, aggravating the disability; (iv)Persons with disabilities are under- represented – Average people are unaware of the barriers persons with disabilities face – Visual media must reflect their lived experiences – Their portrayal must capture the multitudes of their lived realities, and should not be a uni-dimensional, ableist characterisation; (v) Visual media should strive to depict the diverse realities of persons with disabilities, showcasing not only their challenges but also their successes, talents, and contributions to society – This balanced representation can help dispel stereotypes and promote a more inclusive understanding of disability; (vi) They should neither be lampooned based on myths (such as, ‘blind people bump into objects in their path’) nor presented as ‘super cripples’ on the other extreme – This stereotype implies that persons with disabilities have extraordinary heroic abilities that merit their dignified treatment; (vii) Decision-making bodies must bear in mind the values of participation – The ‘nothing about us, without us’ principle is based on the promotion of participation of persons with disabilities and equalisation of opportunities – It must be put to practice in constituting statutory committees and inviting expert opinions for assessing the overall message of films and their impact on dignity of individuals under the Cinematograph Act and Rules; (viii) The CPRD also requires consultation with and involvement of persons with disabilities in the implementation of measures to encourage portrayal that is consistent with it; (ix) Training and sensitization programs should be implemented for individuals involved in creating visual media content, including writers, directors, producers, and actors – These programs should emphasize the impact of their portrayals on public perceptions and the lived experiences of persons with disabilities – Topics should include the principles of the social model of disability, the importance of respectful language, and the need for accurate and empathetic representation. [Para 74] 250 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Cinematograph Act, 1952 – Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 – Disability humour and Disabling humour: Held: Humour and disabilities are viewed as uneasy companions – This is primarily because of the historical use of humour to mock disability, make jokes at the expense of persons with disabilities and to use them for comic relief – This Court must distinguish ‘disabling humour’ that demeans and disparages persons with disability from ‘disability humour’ which challenges conventional wisdom about disability – While disability humour attempts to better understand and explain disability, disabling humour denigrates it – The two cannot be equated in their impact on dignity and on stereotypes about persons with disabilities.
