Having undertaken to indemnify an insured against possible loss in specifi ed situations, an insurance company is expected to make good on its promise in a bonafi de and fair manner and not just care for and cater to its own profi ts. In eff ect, the action of the insurance company in refusing to act upon the Death Certifi cate dated 01.05.1995 issued by the Directorate of Fisheries, Visakhapatnam, cannot be countenanced. 14. Computations made by the appellant and recorded by the NCDRC in paragraph 21 of the under challenge, viz, ` 75,98,361/- (as per Input Cost Method) and ` 75,87,750/- (as per Unit Cost Method) are found to be accurate, in terms of the fi gures mentioned in the Death Certifi cate dated 01.05.1995. As per the Fortnightly Valuation Method, the loss would work out to ` 79,20,000/-. Admittedly, the appellant would be entitled to the lowest of the aforestated three valuations, viz., ` 75,87,750/-. As the respondent company would have already paid the appellant the amount quantifi ed by the NCDRC in the impugned , viz., ` 30,69,486.80, the appellant would be entitled to receive the balance amount of ` 45,18,263.20. The delay on the part of the insurance company in settling the appellant’s claim fairly and in a timely manner warrants that it pays interest on the amount due and payable to the appellant in terms of this . 15. Though the appellant claims that bank deposit interest rates ranged between 12% to 13% during the fi nancial year 1995-1996, we fi nd from the RBI statement, relied upon in this regard, that the interest rate for the fi nancial year 1994-95 was 11% and for the year 1996-97, it was between 11% to 13%. That being so, the interest rate fi xed by the NCDRC, viz, 10% is held to be just and equitable. 16. The sum of ` 45,18,263.20 shall be remitted by the respondent insurance company to the appellant, with simple interest thereon @ 10% from the date of the complaint till the date of realization, within six weeks from today.
