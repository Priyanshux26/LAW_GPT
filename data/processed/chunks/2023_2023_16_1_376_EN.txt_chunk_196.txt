The view of the Commission that most Union territories were on the journey towards becoming viable administrative units and attaining autonomy is borne out by their journey in the decades after its report. III. The journey of Union territories: 1956 to 2023 492. It is useful to examine the journey of the constitutional status of various Union territories. We preface this historical journey with the preface that there is no homogenous class of Union territories since the Constitution envisages a unique relationship of each of them with the Union. 493. The Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act 1956 created six Union territories: Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and the Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands.338 Delhi attained a distinct, sui generis status with the insertion of Article 239AA in 1991 by the Sixty-ninth constitutional amendment and is not similar to other Union territories.339 Himachal Pradesh was granted statehood with the enactment of the State of Himachal Pradesh Act 1970. Manipur and Tripura became States upon the enactment of the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act 1971. This statute also established the Union territories of Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh, which were granted statehood in 1986.340 The Andaman and Nicobar Islands continue to be Union territories as do the Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands, the name of which was changed to Lakshadweep.341 338 Section 2, Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act 1956 339 State (NCT of Delhi) v. Union of India, (2023) 9 SCC 1 340 State of Mizoram Act 1986; State of Arunachal Pradesh Act 1986 341 Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands (Alteration of Name) Act 1973 IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 281 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 494. Goa, Daman and Diu were added to the First Schedule as a Union Territory in 1962342 as was Puducherry (previously known as Pondicherry).343 In 1966, Chandigarh was also made a Union territory.344 A couple of decades later, the State of Goa was formed with the enactment of the Goa, Daman and Diu Reorganisation Act 1987. Daman and Diu continued to be a single Union Territory. It was eventually merged with Dadra and Nagar Haveli.345 495. Of all the Union territories in the history of the country, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Goa, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh attained full statehood and Delhi attained signifi cant autonomy with its sui generis status. As each of these territories (except Delhi in view of its status as the National Capital) became viable administrative units, they found a place in the constitutional structure as States. However, other areas continued to remain as Union Territories because they were not considered to be viable administrative units or because of other strategic or security-based reasons. These Union territories are smaller than those which eventually attained statehood. 496. The relevance of this discussion is elucidated by the observations of one of us (DY Chandrachud, CJI) in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Union of India:346 “303. … The words of the Constitution cannot be construed merely by alluding to what a dictionary of the language would explain.
