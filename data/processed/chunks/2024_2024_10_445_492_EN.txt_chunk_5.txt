It is submitted that if it is found that the legislative enactment is not based on an intelligible differentia, then such a classification would not be permissible and the enactment would be liable to be struck down on the ground of manifest arbitrariness. 10. Per contra, Shri Farasat, learned AAG appearing on behalf of the respondents submits that a reasonable classification having a nexus with the object to be achieved is permissible under Article 14 of the Constitution. He submits that merely because Khalsa University (appellant No.1) has been singled out as against the other Universities established under the 2010 Policy cannot be a ground for holding the Impugned Act to be invalid. 11. The learned AAG submits that there is a presumption with regard to the validity of a legislative action. He submits that the burden with 8 [2017] 9 SCR 797 : (2017) 9 SCC 1 : 2017 INSC 785 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 453 Khalsa University and Another v. The State of Punjab and Another regard to invalidity is on the person who challenges it. It is submitted that the classification is based on the fact that the Khalsa College had, over a period of century, received a heritage status. The name “Khalsa” was identified with the Khalsa College. He submitted that the establishment of Khalsa University tinkered with the heritage status of Khalsa College. 12. The learned AAG further submitted that the Khalsa University and the Khalsa College have been established in the same premises and therefore there is a possibility of confusion being caused in the minds of a general observer. He further submitted that it was, over a period of time, the Khalsa College had earned a huge reputation and was playing a leading role in Punjabi socio-religious society. It is submitted that the establishment of a private University could diminish its nature. It is submitted that there was further a possibility that Khalsa Society (appellant No.2) would allocate greater attention and resources to the private university and neglect Khalsa College which has a historic value. To buttress his submissions, he relies on the s of this Court in the cases of Chandan Banerjee and Others v. Krishna Prosad Ghosh and Others9 and State of Tamil Nadu and Another v. National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Association.10 13. Shri Farasat further submitted that the appellants had no vested right in their status as a University. It is submitted that shortly after the 2016 Act was enacted, the Impugned Act came to be enacted. During that short period, a few students were admitted, however, the Impugned Act also took care of the said students inasmuch as the colleges where they were studying were affiliated with the other Universities. He therefore submits that there is no merit in the appeal and the appeal deserves to be dismissed. CONSIDERATION: 14. The facts in the present case are not in dispute. The Government of Punjab, Department of Higher Education had come up with the 2010 Policy. The 2010 Policy was framed in to attract high quality private sector investment and expertise in the realm of higher 9 [2021] 11 SCR 720 : (2022) 15 SCC 453 : 2021 INSC 516 10 [2021] 7 SCR 479 : (2021) 15 SCC 534 : 2021 INSC 777 454 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
