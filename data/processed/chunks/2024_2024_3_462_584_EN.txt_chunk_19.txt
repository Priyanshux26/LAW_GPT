The minority correctly notes that the offence of bribery is complete before the member even enters the House and therefore, the offence has no connection or correlation with the vote that she may cast in Parliament. The protection under Articles 105(2) and 194(2) is not available when the alleged criminal acts are committed outside Parliament; 19.4. The proposition that MPs are immune from prosecution for an offence of bribery in connection with their votes in Parliament is subversive of the rule of law; 19.5. The majority results in an anomalous situation, where an MP who accepts a bribe and does not cast his vote can be prosecuted, while a member who casts his vote is given immunity; 19.6. The position of law in the United Kingdom, as developed over the years, confirms the proposition that the claim of privilege cannot be extended to immunity from prosecution for the offence of bribery; and 19.7. The international trend (particularly in the United States, Canada and Australia) is that parliamentary privilege does not extend to the offence of bribery. This trend is correctly relied on in the minority , while the majority relies on decisions which have been subsequently diluted even in their original jurisdictions. 13 Raja Ram Pal v. Hon’ble Speaker Lok Sabha, [2007] 1 SCR 317 : (2007) 3 SCC 184, Lokayukta, Justice Ripusudan Dayal v. State of M.P. [2014] 3 SCR 242 : (2014) 4 SCC 473 and State of Kerala v. K. Ajith, [2021] 6 SCR 774 : (2021) SCC OnLine 510 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 489 Sita Soren v. Union of India 20. Mr Gopal Sankarnarayan, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the intervenor endorsed the view taken by the amicus curiae. Additionally, he made the following submissions: 20.1. While the majority has been doubted on multiple occasions, the minority has been extensively relied on by this Court; 20.2. The word “any” employed in Articles 105 and 194 of the Constitution ought to be given a narrow interpretation and should not mechanically be interpreted as ‘everything’, especially as it grants an exceptional immunity not available to the common person; 20.3. The expression “in respect of” must be read narrowly. It must be tied down to ‘legitimate acts’ that are a part of the legislative process involving speech or a vote in Parliament or before a committee. Any other interpretation would violate the sanctity of the democratic process and the trust placed in the legislators by the public; 20.4. Strict interpretation ought to be given to laws dealing with corruption which affects the public interest; 20.5. The offence of bribery is complete on receipt of the bribe well before the vote is given or speech is made in Parliament. The offence under Section 7 (and Section 13) of the PC Act does not require ‘performance’. Therefore, the delivery of results is irrelevant to the offence being established and the distinction created by the majority is artificial; 20.6. The effect of the majority is that it creates an illegitimate class of public servants which is afforded extraordinary protection which would be a violation of Article 14, as also being manifestly arbitrary; and 20.7.
