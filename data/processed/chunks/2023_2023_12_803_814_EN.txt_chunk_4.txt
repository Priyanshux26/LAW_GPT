Sagufa Ahmed (supra) was pronounced on 18.09.2020 when the s of 23.03.2020, 06.05.2020 and 10.07.2020 were in vogue. The of 23.03.2020 in In Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation reads as under: - “This Court has taken Suo Motu cognizance of the situation arising out of the challenge faced by the coun-try on account of Covid-19 Virus and resultant diffi -culties that may be faced by litigants across the coun-try in fi ling their peti-tions/applications/suits/appeals/all other proceed-ings within the period of limitation prescribed under the general law of limitation or under Special Laws (both Central and/or State). To obviate such diffi culties and to ensure that lawyers/litigants do not have to come physically to fi le such proceedings in respective Courts/Tribunals across the country including this Court, it is hereby ed that a period of limitation in all such proceedings, irrespective of the limitation prescribed under the general law or Special Laws whether condonable or not shall stand extended w.e.f. 15th March 2020 till further /s to be passed by this Court in present proceedings. We are exercising this power under Article 142 read with Article 141 of the Constitution of India and declare that this is a binding within the meaning of Article 141 on all Courts/ Tribunals and authorities. This may be brought to the notice of all High Courts for being communicated to all subordinate Courts/Tribunals within their respective jurisdiction.

The of 06.05.2020 directed that the limitation prescribed under the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 shall stand extended w.e.f. 15.03.2020 until further s. It also provides that in case the limitation had expired after 15.03.2020, the period between 15.03.2020 and lifting of lockdown in the jurisdictional area would be extended for a period of 15 days after the lifting of lockdown. Thereafter, on 10.07.2020, taking note of the submission of the learned Attorney General, this Court extended the of 23.03.2020 and 06.05.2020 to Section 29A of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and also to Section 23(4) which provided for timelines for completion of statement of claim and defence and also extended time under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 which prescribed time limit for completing the process of compulsory pre-litigation, mediation and settlement. What is signifi cant is that there was no change in the basic of 23.03.2020, namely, that what was extended was the period of limitation. 14. It was on this basis that Sagufa Ahmed’s case (supra) decided on 18.09.2020 held in para 17 as under:- “17. But we do not think that the appellants can take refuge under the above in Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In re. What was extended by the above or-der of this Court was only “the period of limitation” and not the period up to which delay can be condoned in exer-cise of discretion conferred by the statute…….” 15.
