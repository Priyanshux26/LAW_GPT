Resultantly, we hold that there was no breach of duty of care at Suretech Hospital or on part of Dr. Biviji, Dr. Jaiswal and/or Dr. Shendre. The charge of negligence is, therefore, not proved. Hence, the impugned 140 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. awarding Rs. 6,11,638/- as compensation @ 9% simple interest p.a. on account of medical negligence committed by the single act of performing the aforesaid ‘NI’ procedure, is found to be erroneous and is set aside. 57. Resultantly, the appeal fi led by Dr. M.A Biviji (Civil Appeal No. 3975 of 2018) as well as the appeal fi led by Dr. Nirmal Jaiswal, Dr. Madhusudan Shendre and Suretech Hospital (Civil Appeal arising out of Diary No. 21513 of 2018) are allowed to the extent that the charges attributing medical negligence to Suretech Hospital, Dr. Biviji, Dr. Jaiswal, and Dr. Shendre are found not proved. The appeal fi led by Mrs. Sunita (Civil Appeal No. 4847 of 2018) is accordingly dismissed. Parties to bear their own cost. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals disposed of. Ankit Gyan
