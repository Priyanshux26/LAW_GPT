f) As regards the averment of the appellant that the filing of the writ petition was delayed, the respondents submitted that the High Court in the impugned factually recorded that there was no delay of 17 years and that the delay was at most of 5 to 6 years. g) The learned counsel relied on this Court’s decision in Kolkata Municipal Corporation & Anr. v.

D. ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION 45. Having heard the learned counsels appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the following questions fall for our consideration: 1020 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (i) Whether the High Court committed any error in taking the view that the respondents herein should be non-suited on the ground of delay and laches? (ii) Whether the High Court committed any error in holding that non-compliance of the mandatory requirements of Section 52 of the RUI Act had rendered the notification issued under Section 52(1) dated 16.06.1977 invalid?

(iv) Whether the requirement to pass the award within the stipulated time frame of one year or as the case maybe, two years from the date of commencement (i.e. 01.08.1987) of the Amending Act, 1987 as contemplated by sub-section (3) of Section 60A of the RUI Act is applicable to the compulsory acquisition made under sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 52 of the RUI Act, after the extension of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 to the State of Rajasthan?
