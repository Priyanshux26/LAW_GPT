6 to 8. They argued that the General Power of Attorney (Ext.1) was limited in scope and effectively revoked by the partition deed dated 17.02.1988 (Ext.6/a), which allocated specific shares to each co-owner and only authorized Defendant No. 1 to collect rent, not to sell the property. The defendants maintained that the agreement dated 06.06.1993 was incomplete and unenforceable, as it was contingent upon obtaining the consent and participation of Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, which was never secured. They further asserted that the plaintiffs failed to fulfil the terms of the agreement, particularly in not ensuring the presence and consent of the sisters within the stipulated time, indicating lack of readiness and willingness to perform their obligations. The defendants highlighted that the sale deed executed on 27.09.1993 in favour of Defendant Nos. 9 to 11 was valid, having been executed with the full consent and participation of all co-owners, including Defendant Nos. 6 to 8. They asserted that the appellants were bona fide purchasers for value without notice of any enforceable prior agreement, rendering the plaintiffs’ claims untenable. 5. The Trial Court, after framing issues and examining the evidence, dismissed the suit of the plaintiffs for specific performance. The key findings of the Trial Court were as follows: 5.1 The Court found that the agreement dated 06.06.1993 was executed only by Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra, without any signatures or explicit consent from Defendant Nos. 6 to 8. The agreement itself acknowledged that the sisters were not present and their willingness needed to be secured, stating that they would come to Baripada within three months to execute the sale deed. 5.2 The Trial Court examined the General Power of Attorney and concluded that it did not explicitly authorize Defendant No. 1 to sell the property on behalf of the sisters. Moreover, the GPA was impliedly revoked by the subsequent partition deed (Ext.6/a), which allocated specific shares to each co-owner and only authorized Defendant No. 1 to collect rent, not to sell the property. 5.3 The agreement was deemed incomplete and unenforceable against Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, as their consent and participation were essential for a valid sale. The agreement’s reliance on 954 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports future consent rendered it a contingent contract that did not materialize within the stipulated time. 5.4 The Court observed that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate continuous readiness and willingness to perform their part of the contract. They did not take effective steps to secure the consent and presence of the sisters within the three-month period specified in the agreement. Their inaction and reliance solely on Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra indicated a lack of diligence and commitment to fulfilling the contractual obligations. 5.5 The Court considered whether specific performance could be granted for the 2/5th share belonging to Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra. It concluded that such partial enforcement was impractical and inequitable, given the nature of the property and its existing lease to Defendant No.
