We are, therefore, of the opinion that the successful party finally held entitled to a relief assessable in terms of money at the end of the litigation, is entitled to be compensated by award of interest at a suitable reasonable rate for the period for which the interim of F the court withholding the release of money had remained in operation.” (emphasis supplied) 336. In State of Gujarat v. Essar Oil Ltd. [State of Gujarat v. Essar Oil Ltd., (2012) 3 SCC 522], it was observed that the G principle of restitution is a remedy against unjust enrichment or unjust benefit. The Court observed : (SCC p. 542, paras 61-62) “61. The concept of restitution is virtually a common law principle, and it is a remedy against unjust enrichment or unjust benefit. The core of the concept lies in the conscience of the H BHUPINDER SINGH v. UNITECH LIMITED 961 [M. R. SHAH, J.] court, which prevents a party from retaining money or some A benefit derived from another, which it has received by way of an erroneous decree of the court. Such remedy in English Law is generally different from a remedy in contract or in tort and falls within the third category of common law remedy, which is called quasi-contract or restitution. B 62. If we analyse the concept of restitution, one thing emerges clearly that the obligation to restitute lies on the person or the authority that has received unjust enrichment or unjust benefit (see Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 9, p. 434).” C 337. In A. Shanmugam v. Ariya Kshatriya Rajakula Vamsathu Madalaya Nandhavana Paripalanai Sangam [A. Shanmugam v. Ariya Kshatriya Rajakula Vamsathu Madalaya Nandhavana Paripalanai Sangam, (2012) 6 SCC 430], it was stated that restitutionary jurisdiction is inherent in every court, to neutralise D the advantage of litigation. A person on the right side of the law should not be deprived, on account of the effects of litigation; the wrongful gain of frivolous litigation has to be eliminated if the faith of people in the judiciary has to be sustained. The Court observed : (SCC pp. 451-55, para 37) E “37. This Court, in another important case in Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India [Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India, (2011) 8 SCC 161] (of which one of us, Dr Bhandari, J. was the author of the ) had an occasion to deal with the concept of restitution. The relevant paragraphs of that dealing with relevant F s are reproduced hereunder : (SCC pp. 238-41 & 243, paras 171-76 & 183-84) ‘170. * * * 171. In Ram Krishna Verma v. State of U.P. [Ram Krishna Verma v. State of U.P., (1992) 2 SCC 620] this G Court observed as under : (SCC p. 630, para 16) “16. The 50 operators, including the appellants/private operators, have been running their stage carriages by blatant abuse of the process of the court by delaying the hearing as directed in Jeewan Nath Wahal case [Jeewan H 962 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R.
