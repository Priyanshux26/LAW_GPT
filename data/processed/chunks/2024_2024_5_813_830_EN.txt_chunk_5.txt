The learned Single Judge of Madras High Court proceeded to dismiss the said petition preferred by the appellants vide dated 23rd April, 2018 which is subject matter of challenge in this appeal by special leave. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 821 C. Subbiah @ Kadambur Jayaraj and Others v. The Superintendent of Police and Others Submissions on behalf of appellants: - 19. Learned senior counsel, Mr. Dama Seshadri Naidu representing the appellants vehemently and fervently contended that even if the allegations set out in the FIR and the charge sheet are treated to be true on the face of record, the same do not constitute the necessary ingredients of the offences alleged. He contended that looking at the admitted facts as set out in the complaint, the dispute, if any, between the parties is purely of civil nature and thus, continuance of the proceedings pursuant to the charge sheet filed against the accused appellants would tantamount to gross abuse of process of law. The charge sheet clearly spells out that a part of the sale proceeds from the land deals were paid to the complainant, but the entire amount as per his entitlement was not paid. Thus, as per Shri Naidu, for alleged part performance of contractual obligations, the tool of criminal law has been misused by the complainant. 20. He further submitted that the complainant being a teacher serving in the Government establishment was not entitled to indulge in property transactions and thus, at his own risk, he made the investments through the accused appellants herein and when the profit sharing quotient towards the land deals did not work out to the complainant’s satisfaction, the process of criminal law was misused so as to launch a purely frivolous prosecution against the accused appellants.
