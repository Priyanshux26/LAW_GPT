[2023] 13 S.C.R. 905 : 2023 INSC 906 CASE DETAILS STATE OF U.P. & ANR. v. EHSAN & ANR. (Civil Appeal No.5721 of 2023) OCTOBER 13, 2023 [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA AND MANOJ MISRA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Whether in exercise of writ jurisdiction the High Court should have refrained from adjudicating the contentious issue with regard to taking of actual possession of the surplus land from the landholder, when the same was not decided in the previous round of litigation even though it had arisen for consideration. Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 – The High Court disposed of the writ petition by and dated 08.10.2018 declaring that the land in dispute shall continue to be in possession of the fi rst respondent-original petitioner and would not be treated as surplus land as he is entitled to the benefi ts of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 – Propriety: Held: Having regard to the following: (a) that there was a serious dispute with regard to taking of possession of the surplus land; (b) that there was a delay of about seven years in fi ling the fi rst writ petition from the date when possession was allegedly taken by the State, after publication of the vesting notifi cation; (c) that no documentary evidence such as a Khasra or Khatauni of the period between alleged date of taking possession and fi ling of the fi rst writ petition was fi led by the original petitioner; (d) that in the earlier two rounds of litigation, the High Court refrained from deciding the issue of possession of the surplus land even though that issue had arisen directly between the parties; and (e) that infraction of the prescribed statutory procedure for taking possession cannot be the sole basis to discard State’s claim of possession, when it is stated to have been taken long before the 905 906 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. date the issue is raised, this Court is of the considered view that the High Court should have refrained from deciding the issue with regard to taking of actual possession of the surplus land prior to the cut off date specifi ed in the Repeal Act, 1999 – Instead, the writ petitioner should have been relegated to a suit – The impugned passed by the High Court is set aside – The fi rst respondent’s writ petition is dismissed without prejudice to his right to institute a suit.
