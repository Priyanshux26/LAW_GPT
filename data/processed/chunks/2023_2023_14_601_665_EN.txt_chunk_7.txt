It was further observed by the Appellate Authority that old documents (including the appellant’s medical records) have been destroyed as per the necessary policy and while disagreeing with the fi ndings of the Release Medical Board (where HIV was attributed to the service), observed that in absence of any causative factor between blood transfusion and acquiring HIV infection, HIV infection cannot be attributed to the service and thus found no negligence on behalf of the hospital authorities. Relevant fi ndings of the Appellate Authority are reproduced below: 7 Dated 05.05.2017. 8 Vide letter no 6004/A/GS (Edn). 9 Dated 12.06.2018. 612 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. “10. It is informed that as per the PE of the hospital, 171 Military Hospital is not authorized any blood bank and hence no Pathologist is authorized or posted, at any time. However, an adhoc blood bank was established during ‘Op Parakram’ i.e. in 2002. Blood would be requisitioned from 166 MH and stored at 171 MH.” **** “16. It is pertinent to ask here as to how a blanket & an assured statement be made that a blood transfusion carried out in 2002 is the only causative factor for acquiring HIV infection in 2014 without ascertaining facts about the same.” 12. Meanwhile, proceedings of the Court of Inquiry (CoI) were held on 01.07.2018 to investigate circumstances under which the appellant was transfused blood at the 171 Military Hospital, Samba and the CoI concluded by its fi ndings that blood provided to the appellant was duly screened for the HIV and other markers in vogue at the relevant time and on examination of all the witnesses, no negligence or lapse can be attributed on the part of physician or the support staff at the said military facility. During the proceedings, Lt Col Devika Bhat, posted as MO (Physician) at the 171 MH, Samba deposed that the blood transfused to the appellant was duly screened as per the guidelines and all necessary precautions were taken to prevent HIV transmission. It was further observed by the CoI that while the Release Medical Board has opined that infection can be attributed to service, but the specialist opinion before the Release Medical Board failed to mention essential details to establish a causative link between the blood transfusion in 2002 and the detection of infection in 2014. 13. The CoI further observed that: “6. It is further emphasized that Specialist Opinion given during RMB has not mentioned about history of any sexual exposure, administration of IV Fluids or injections or any prolonged Hospital treatment which are other modes of transmission by HIV in the intervening period between Jul 2002 to may 2014 (period between blood transfusion at 171 MH and detection as HIV positive). Hence categorically attributing HIV infection of the individual to blood transfusion given in Jul 2002 may not be in .” CPL ASHISH KUMAR CHAUHAN (RETD.) v. COMMANDING 613 OFFICER & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] The CoI also observed that: “8. [..] (d) All the available documents have been examined and it emerges that there were no lapses or negligence on the part of treating physician and supporting staff at 171 MH Samba and the blood bank staff of 166 MH Jammu as all policy/guidelines were followed for blood bank, screening of blood before Transfusion of one unit of blood to 741570B Ex Cpl Ashish Kumar Chauhan.” 14.
