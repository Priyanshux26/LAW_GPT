[Paras 26, 27, 57] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – According to the prosecution, appellant had illicit intimacy with ‘L’ however, after she tried to distance herself, the appellant was seriously aggrieved – Allegedly, on the fateful night he gained access into her house by making a hole in the eastern side wall of the house and murdered ‘L’ along with three others in the house – Appellant was the only other person inside the house, no cogent explanation came from him as to what transpired at the scene of occurrence: Held: Evidence of the prosecution witnesses and even the version of the accused establishes his presence at the scene of 916 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports occurrence – Appellant was the only other person inside the house, with the other three being dead and one ‘KA’, who was injured and unconscious and who later died in that state itself – There was no cogent and plausible explanation forthcoming from the accused as to what transpired at the scene of occurrence – This coupled with the fact that his relationship with the deceased ‘L’ was strained clearly point to his guilt – s.106 states that when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him – s.106 is not intended to relieve the prosecution of its duty – However, in exceptional cases where it could be impossible or at any rate disproportionately difficult for the prosecution to establish the facts which are especially within the knowledge of the accused, the burden will be on the accused since he could prove as to what transpired in such scenario, without difficulty or inconvenience – In this case, when an offence like multiple murders is committed inside a house in secrecy, the initial burden has to be discharged by the prosecution – Once the prosecution successfully discharged the burden cast upon it, the burden did shift upon the appellant being the only other person inside the four corners of the house to offer a cogent and plausible explanation as to how the offences came to be committed but he miserably failed on that score.
