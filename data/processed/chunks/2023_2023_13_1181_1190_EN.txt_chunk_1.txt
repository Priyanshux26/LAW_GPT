NEDUMPARA & ORS. v. 1183 UNION OF INDIA & ORS OTHER CASE DETAILS INCLUDING IMPUGNED AND APPEARANCES CIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Writ Petition (Civil) No. 320 of 2023. Under Article 32 of The Constitution of India. Appearances: Mathews J. Nedumpara, Petitioner-in-person Ms. Maria Nedumpara, Adv. for the Petitioners. / OF THE SUPREME COURT SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J. 1. The petitioners, practicing Advocates, have fi led the present writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India for a declaration that the designation of Advocates as Senior Advocates under Sections 16 and 23(5) of the Advocates Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘said Act’) as well as under Rule 2 of IV of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013, creating a special class of Advocates with special rights, privileges and status not available to ordinary Advocates is unconstitutional being violative of the mandate of equality under Artilce14 and Right to Practice any Profession under Article 19 as well as Right to Life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It is their say that such designation has created a class of Advocates with special rights, and the same has been seen as a result only for kith and kin of Judges, Senior Advocates, politicians, Ministers, etc., resulting in the legal industry being monopolised by a small group of designated Advocates, leaving the vast majority of meritorious law practitioners as ordinary plebians receiving discriminatory treatment. 2. We may notice that it is contended that this Court in Indira Jaisingh vs. Supreme Court of India, Through Secretary General & Ors.1, upheld the vires of the said Act providing for the designation of Advocates as 1 (2017) 9 SCC 766 118 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. Senior Advocates and illegally providing guidelines for such designation, amounting to judicial legislation. We may here add that there have been further modifi cations and formulations for designation by a subsequent rendered in Indira Jaisingh vs. Supreme Court of India, Through Secretary General & Ors.2 in pursuance to the liberty reserved in the aforesaid .
