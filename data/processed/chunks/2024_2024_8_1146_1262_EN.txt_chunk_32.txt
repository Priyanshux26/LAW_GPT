The matter having attained finality, the appellants deserve to be discharged. 55 (2020) 9 SCC 636 56 [2022] 3 SCR 698 : (2022) 7 SCC 370 57 [2024] 4 SCR 29 : 2024 SCC OnLine SC 483 58 [2014] 4 SCR 554 : (2014) 13 SCC 55 59 (2015) 10 SCC 152 60 [2017] 9 SCR 341 : (2017) 15 SCC 560 61 (2022) 4 SCC 574 62 [2023] 2 SCR 997: (2023) 4 SCC 731 63 [2023] 4 SCR 133 : (2023) SCC OnLine SC 424 64 (both of who were serving officers in KPCL at the relevant point of time) 1204 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 5. ARGUMENTS BY COUNSEL FOR THE RESPONDENT-CBI 5.1 Mr. Cheema, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondent – CBI has refuted each and every argument advanced by learned counsel for the appellants. He submitted that the appellants have unduly placed heavy reliance on the fact that the original Mining Plan was approved by the MoC on 08th December, 2004 and the said Mining Plan did not contain any specific clause for disposal of rejects. Similarly, unnecessary reference has been made by the appellants to Rule 22(5) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 to demonstrate what information is required to be disclosed in a Mining Plan. It is submitted that the argument advanced by the appellants that in the absence of any stipulation in the Mining Plan regarding disposal of the rejects, there could be no inference of commission of any offence or a shadow cast on the conduct of the appellants, is flawed. 5.2 Learned counsel for the respondent-CBI has canvassed that there was a latent error in the assumption of the appellants that it was for the MoC to incorporate a clause regarding disposal of the rejects in the Mining Plan and in the absence of any such clause, KPCL or KECML could not be held responsible for the disposal of the rejects, which was done in an illegal manner or that when the Mining Plan was silent regarding the manner in which the rejects were to be disposed of, it was for KPCL and KECML to deal with the rejects in an appropriate manner. The aforesaid presumptions are stated to be without any basis and opposed to the letter dated 10th November, 2003, addressed by the MoC to KPCL that lays down the conditions of allotment of the captive coal blocks in para 3 that specifically states in sub-para (iv) as follows: “3 The allotment of the captive blocks will also be subject to the following conditions:· xxxxx (iv) The allocattee would furnish to this Ministry detailed plan for disposal of unusable containing carbon material obtained during the process of a mining or any process thereafter including washing etc. so as to avoid any need [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1205 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation for disposal of the same through sale etc. at a later stage, within 30 days of receipt of this letter or submission of mining plan whichever is earlier.” 5.3 As per the respondent-CBI, it was the duty of KPCL to furnish the detailed plan for the disposal of the rejects to the Ministry within 30 days of the receipt of the letter dated 10th November, 2003 or submission of the Mining Plan, whichever is earlier and this requirement was independent of the Mining Plan.
