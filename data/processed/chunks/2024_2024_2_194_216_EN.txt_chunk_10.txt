This delicate balance between specificity and generality in legal delegation is crucial for effective governance and adaptability to evolving legal landscapes. 25. For the sake of completeness, we may refer to some leading precedents of this Court which have discussed the ‘generality versus enumeration’ principle. 26. In State of Jammu and Kashmir v Lakhwinder Kumar and Ors., (2013) 6 SCC 333, this Court held that when a general power to make regulations is followed by a specific power to make regulations, the latter does not limit the former. This is the principle of ‘generality vs enumeration’: a residuary provision can always be given voice. 2 See, BSNL v. TRAI, (2014) 3 SCC 222; King Emperor v. Sibnath Banerji: AIR 1945 PC 156; Afzal Ullah v. State of U.P, AIR 1964 SC 264; Rohtak and Hissar Districts Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P.,AIR 1966 SC 1471; K. Ramanathan v. State of T.N. (1985) 2 SCC 116; D.K. Trivedi and Sons v. State of Gujarat, 1986 Supp SCC 20 210 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 27. In Academy of Nutrition Improvement v. Union of India (2011) 8 SCC 274, this Court had interpreted a pari materia expression “in particular and without the generality of the foregoing power, such Rules may provide for all or any of the following matters”. This Court held as follows : “………where power is conferred to make subordinate legislation in general terms, the subsequent particularisation of the matters/topics has to be construed as merely illustrative and not limiting the scope of the general power. Consequently, even if the specific enumerated topics in section 23(1A) may not empower the Central Government to make the impugned rule (Rule 44-I), making of the Rule can be justified with reference to the general power conferred on the central government under section 23(1), provided the rule does not travel beyond the scope of the Act” 28. In the case of State of Kerala v. Shri M. Appukutty (1963) 14 STC 242, the provisions of Section 19 (1) and (2) (f) of the Madras General Sales Tax Act of 1939 came up for consideration of this Court. It was unsuccessfully argued therein that Rule 17(1) was ultra vires the rule making power specifically enumerated in Section 19(2)(f). 29. The relevant provisions involved there were similar in form to the applicable provisions in the instant case. Section 19 (1),(2),2(f) read as follows: (1) The State Government may make rules to carry out the purposes of this Act. (2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of foregoing power such rules may provide for-- ***** (f) the assessment to tax under this Act of any turnover which has escaped assessment and the period within which such assessment may be made, not exceeding three years; Dealing with the objection raised, this Court observed:-- “..... Rule 17 (1) and (3A) ex facie properly fall under Section 19(2)(f). In any event as was said by the Privy Council in King Emperor v. Sibnath Banerji MANU/PR/0024/1945, [2024] 2 S.C.R.
