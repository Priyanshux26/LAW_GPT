Accordingly, we are of the considered opinion that the formal union between the parties is neither justified nor desirable. 8. Thus, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the allegations levelled inter se the parties, we deem it appropriate to exercise our discretion under Article 142(1) of the Constitution of India and pass a decree of divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. 9. However, considering the fact that the Appellant has previously been employed by various multinational corporations in managerial post(s); and the fact that the Appellant is presently endowed with a respectable estate; we deem it fit and proper that the Appellant pays an amount of Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Lakh Only) to the Respondent Wife as permanent alimony. The aforesaid amount shall be paid to the Respondent Wife as per the following schedule: 884 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Date Amount May 15, 2024 Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakh Only) June 15, 2024 Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakh Only) July 15, 2024 Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakh Only) August 15, 2024 Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakh Only) September 15, 2024 Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakh Only) 10. The appeal stands allowed in the aforesaid terms. The Registry is directed to prepare a decree of divorce accordingly. The decree shall be handed over to the parties, only after proof of payment of the full amount as indicated by us above is furnished to the Registry. 11. Before parting, we place on record our gratitude to Shri P.S. Patwalia, Learned Senior Counsel for the assistance rendered to this Court. 12. Pending application(s) (if any), shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Raghav Bhatia, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Liz Mathew, Sr. Adv.)
