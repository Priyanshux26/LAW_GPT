[2024] 8 S.C.R. 1351 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. 16. In his concurring opinion, Justice HK Sema held that the purpose of reservations is to afford special protection to the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as a homogenous class of persons. Further classification of this class of people would amount to tinkering with the Presidential List. This regrouping of a homogenous group would, also amount to reverse discrimination and be violative of Article 14.22 17. In his concurring opinion, Justice SB Sinha held that Indra Sawhney (supra), while determining whether backward classes could be divided into more backward and backward classes, was not dealing with Scheduled Castes.23 In that context, Justice Sinha observed: a. Unlike the Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are treated as a separate class by the Scheduled Castes and Tribes s;24 b. The State had failed to establish the reasonableness of its classification among the Scheduled Castes;25 c. The Relli Community was the most backward community and hardly received any benefits of reservations. On the other hand, the Adi Andhra community was numerically larger and educationally better off compared to the Rellis. Both these groups were placed in Group A and Group D respectively and each was given the same 1% share in total reservations. The Act thus wrongly treated them alike despite apparent differences, without any basis;26 d. Micro-classification was impermissible under Article 14;27 22 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sema, 49, 50] 23 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sinha, 75] 24 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sinha, 77] 25 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sinha, 81] 26 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sinha, 97] 27 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sinha, 98]. Relied on Triloki Nath v. State of J&K [1969] 1 SCR 103; State of UP v. Pradip Tandon 1975 1 SCC 267; Akhil Bhartiya Soshit Karamchari Sangh (Rly) v. Union of India (1981) 1 SCC 246. 1352 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports e. Backwardness of the class was the link holding this class together and a classification that is justifiable based on backwardness of the class cannot be based on backwardness of the caste;28 f. Article 16(4) must be read with Article 335 and efficiency of administration cannot be sacrificed to benefit some castes out of the homogenous Scheduled Castes;29 and g. The validity of the sub-classification and not the extent of the reservation was in question. Therefore, the argument that the States have the prerogative to decide the extent of reservations was inapplicable.30 The State could certainly stipulate the legislative policy about the extent of reservations but it could not take away the benefit of reservations on the ground that certain groups among the Scheduled Castes have advanced in the hierarchy.31 iv. The reference 18. On 27 August 2020, in State of Punjab v. Davinder Singh,32 a Constitution Bench held that the in Chinnaiah (supra) requires to be revisited by a larger Bench of seven Judges because it failed to consider significant aspects bearing on the issue. These aspects have been formulated thus: a.
