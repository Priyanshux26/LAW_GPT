Any provision which referred to the Legislative Assembly of the State would therefore be applicable to the Constituent Assembly which was fi lling the shoes of the former until its dissolution in 1957. The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir continued to be treated as the Legislative Assembly and the provision enabling this was subsequently removed by CO 56 on 26 February 1958 after the Constituent Assembly ceased to exist; and d. Sub-clauses (c) and (e), too, merely clarifi ed the meaning to be accorded to certain terms without modifying their fundamental nature. IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 241 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 408. Hence, the modifi cations made by CO 48 to Article 367 were in the nature of clarifi cations. They did not amount to a modifi cation of Article 370 itself either in terms or in eff ect, to a signifi cant or appreciable extent. 409. The Union of India suggested that the insertion of sub-clause (d) was indicative of the fact that the terms ‘Legislative Assembly’ and ‘Constituent Assembly’ were used synonymously. It averred that the two organs were co- equal in the context of the State of Jammu and Kashmir. This argument cannot be accepted. Sub-clause (d) was inserted in recognition of the state of aff airs which existed at the time, namely, that the Constituent Assembly had enacted certain laws for the State prior to the constitution of the Legislative Assembly. This does not indicate that the two organs were at par with one another. While the Constituent Assembly may have discharged the functions of the Legislature for some time, its role did not end there. The task of framing a Constitution is diff erent from the function of enacting laws. The other diff erences between the two bodies have been discussed in detail in the preceding segments of this . 410. CO 56 modified CO 48 inter alia by substituting the word “Rajpramukh” with the word “Governor” in the following terms: “(b) clause (c) shall be omitted’, and clause (d) shall be re-lettered as clause (c); (c) in clause (c) as so re-lettered, in new clause (4) of Article 367, - (i) sub-clause (d) shall be omitted, and sub-clauses (e) and (f) shall be re-lettered as sub-clauses (d) and (e) respectively; (ii) in sub-clause (e) as so re-lettered, for the word “Rajpramukh”, the word “Governor” shall be substituted” 411.
