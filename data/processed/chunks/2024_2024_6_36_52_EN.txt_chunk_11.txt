This direction was found to be justified by the Division Bench, which dismissed the writ appeal by way of the impugned and, in our considered opinion, rightly so. 34. On the above analysis, we find that the impugned dated 25.01.2023 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur in Writ Appeal No. 1706 of 2022 does not brook interference on any ground, be it on facts or in law. The civil appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 5817 of 2023 is, therefore, bereft of merit and is accordingly dismissed. Further, as already mentioned hereinbefore, we are not inclined to entertain and consider SLP (C) Nos. 23514 and 27620 of 2023 on merits. The two SLPs are dismissed. Pending I.A.s shall also stand dismissed. Parties shall bear their respective costs. Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan Result of the case: Civil Appeal and SLPs dismissed.
