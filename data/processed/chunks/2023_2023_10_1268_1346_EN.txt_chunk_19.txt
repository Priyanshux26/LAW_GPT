(II) Whether on the facts and in view of the circumstances of this case, if the supply of parts transferred to the purchaser of vehicles in replacement D in compliance with the stipulations of the warranty is not “sale” within the meaning of clause 2(g) of the Act, the purchase price of the parts purchased on the strength of certificate of registration free of cost or purchased at the concessional rate of tax under E the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, on furnishing ‘C’ form, is liable to be added to the taxable turnover of the purchasing dealer under the provisions of the second proviso to clause (ii) of sub-section (2) of Section 5, of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act 1941, as in force in Delhi ?” F (Underlining by us) (ii) In the said case, the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court considered the of the Financial Commissioner who had held that the transfer of property in the parts of a car replaced under a warranty constituted a “sale” and, as such, the G replacement of parts as a consequence of the terms and stipulations of the warranty must be deemed to be a continuation of the original sale, the price of which was included in the consolidated sale price determined and realised at the time of transfer of goods in the shape of the car with a H 1294 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A warranty. It was further observed that the replacement of parts of the car provided free of cost by the dealer in terms of the warranty was part of the consolidated price realised at the time of the initial transfer and on which sales tax was paid and the replacement of the parts would deem to be a ‘sale’ not liable to imposition of further sales tax. B (iii) The precise question considered in the said case was, whether, transfer of the parts replaced in pursuance of the warranty amounted to a sale within the meaning of the Sales Tax Act and whether the sale price of the car which had been subjected to the sales tax could be regarded as having C included the cost or value of spare parts used in the replacement, in compliance with the stipulations in the warranty. On considering the warranty clause, it was noted that the sale of cars was along with the warranty to replace defective parts free of cost and the price was fixed at the D time of the sale. After noting the distinction between the condition and warranty in a contract of sale of goods, it was observed that the consideration on the defective part, that might be replaced under the warranty was not separately specified because it was included in the price fixed at the time of sale of the car. In other words, the E transfer of property and the part replaced in pursuance of stipulation of warranty is part of the original sale of the car for the price fixed and received from the buyer or consumer.
