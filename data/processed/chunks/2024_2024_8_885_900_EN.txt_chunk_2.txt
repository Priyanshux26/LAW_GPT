RELEVANT FACTS 5. The petitioner, who was an aspirant for the post of District Judge (Entry Level) in the Manipur Judicial Service Grade-I, responded to the advertisement dated 15.05.2013. The petitioner belonged to the Scheduled Caste category and he appeared in the written examination conducted in July 2013 for all the applicants. The High Court of Manipur then issued a Notification on 17.10.2013 declaring that none of the candidates had secured the minimum qualifying marks in the written examination. A grievance was then raised by the petitioner and eventually a corrigendum came to be issued on 07.02.2014 declaring the petitioner to have been successful in the written examination having scored 52.8% marks which satisfied the required benchmark of 50% for the Scheduled Caste category. 6. Just before the interview test, the Full Court of the Manipur High Court on 12.01.2015 decided to fix 40% as the cut-off for the viva- [2024] 8 S.C.R. 889 Salam Samarjeet Singh v. The High Court of Manipur at Imphal & Anr voce examination and the petitioner’s case is that this decision was never intimated to him. The Full Court Resolution reflected that the 40% minimum qualifying marks for passing the interview was fixed by resorting to sub-Rule (3) of Schedule ‘B’ of the Manipur Judicial Service Rules, 2005 (for short “MJS Rules,2005”), which reads as under:- “All necessary steps not provided for in these rules for recruitment under these rules shall be decided by the recruiting authority.” 7. The petitioner who had secured 18.8 marks out of the total 50 marks in the interview segment, was held to be unsuccessful for not having the secured minimum prescribed benchmark of 40%. At this stage, it may be noted that the total marks allocated for the written examination for the three papers were 300 and for the interview segment, a total of 50 marks were prescribed. In his written examination, the petitioner had secured 158.50 marks and 18.8 marks in the interview, his total aggregate score in the written examination plus viva-voce was 177.3 marks, out of the total possible 350 marks. Thus, the percentage of marks scored by the petitioner cumulatively stands at 50.6 percent. It is also pertinent to note that the Manipur High Court subsequently on 9.3.2016 amended Schedule-B, Sub-rule(3) to prescribe 40% minimum cut-off for the viva voce. 8. In the split , Justice Banumathi upheld the rejection of the petitioner for failing to secure minimum 40% in the viva voce. It was observed that the fixation of 40% minimum cut off for viva voce is in consonance with the MJS Rules, 2005 as per Clause 1(3) of the General Instructions provided in Schedule-B. Under the Mode of Evaluation table, securing less than 40% marks has been graded as ‘F’, which carries a grade value of ‘0’. In Justice Banumathi’s opinion, it was therefore implicit that for a ‘pass’ in exam, a minimum of 40% marks must be obtained. It was also noted that after participating in the viva voce, the petitioner cannot turn around and challenge the selection process.
