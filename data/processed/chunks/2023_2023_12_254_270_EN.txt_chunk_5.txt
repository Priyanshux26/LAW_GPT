Both the 262 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. learned counsel have painstakingly taken us through the records of the case and presented their respective points of view very ably. 19. Ms. Uttara Babbar, learned counsel for the appellant, contends that under the Master Circular dated 29.01.1991, Clause 4.3, 5.1 and 6 would apply to the case of the appellant. According to her, on completion of three months continuous service, the appellant acquired the temporary status under Clause 4.3; that under Clause 5, Substitutes, who have acquired temporary status were to be screened by a Screening Committee and not by Selection Boards for the purpose of absorption, and under Clause 6, the date of appointment of a substitute to be recorded in the service book against the column “date of appointment” should be the date on which the substitute attains a temporary status after continuous service of three months, if the same is followed by his/her regular absorption. According to the learned counsel, only for those who do not acquire temporary status and who are regularly appointed, the date of appointment would be the date when they are absorbed. 20. According to the learned counsel, the appellant having completed three months of continuous service as a substitute teacher is entitled to reckon his date of appointment as 04.03.1990 (on completion of three months) since he now stands duly absorbed by the of 02.01.1998. 21. According to the learned counsel, the appellant ought to have been absorbed as Assistant Teacher since he worked as a substitute Assistant Teacher and taught Classes XI and XII. Her further alternative case is if he has to be only considered as absorbed under the category of Primary Teacher, then he should be entitled to the benefi t under the Master Circular dated 29.01.1991 and should be entitled to reckon his service under Clause 6 of the said Circular from 04.03.1990. Learned counsel further contends that the of this Court in the case of the appellant dated 15.02.1996 should be read in conjunction with the of this Court dated 13.10.1995 in the case of Smt. Jayasree Deb Roy (Dutta) - applicant in O.A. No. 149(G) of 1989. Learned counsel lays particular emphasis on the fact that the Tribunal in the appellant’s case in O.A. No. 209 of 1990 had wholly relied on the in the case of O.A. No. 149(G) of 1989 (the case of Smt. Jayasree Deb Roy (Dutta). Reiterating para 4 of the said , learned counsel contends that O.A. No. 209 of 1990 of the appellant was dismissed for the SAMIR KUMAR MAJUMDER v. 263 THE UNION OF INDIA & ORS. [K.V.VISWANATHAN, J.] same reasons that O.A. No. 149(G) of 1989 was dismissed. Learned counsel further emphasizes the fact that in C.A. No. 9424 of 1995, by dated 13.10.1995, this Court in the case of Smt. Jayasree Deb Roy (Dutta) had specifi cally recorded that the of the Tribunal in O.A. No. 149(G) of 1989 was set aside. 22. Learned counsel further contends that even the authorities so understood the s of this Court and it is for that reason that they subjected the appellant also to a screening before the Screening Committee before the absorption on 02.01.1998.
