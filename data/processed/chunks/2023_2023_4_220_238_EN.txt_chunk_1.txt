There cannot be a “discovery” of an already discovered fact! What remains is the discovery of currency notes, wrist watch, ‘Parna’ and hair. The forensic report of hair only says that it belongs to ‘human’. The currency notes cannot be really identified D with the deceased. What remains is the watch and the ‘Parna’, which has been identified with the deceased. The second is the evidence of “last seen”. This is in the form of PW-10 who is the neighbour of the complainant and who had seen the appellant along with co-accused with the deceased on 08.05.2000 at about 7.30 PM in the evening. [Para 8][229-F-H; 230-A-B] E 2. The prosecution has failed to establish important links in this case, which is so vital in a case of circumstantial evidence. Rigor mortis present in the body after 90 hours is unusual, though possible under certain circumstances. It was the duty of the prosecution to explain it. The defense too failed to question it F and the Court remained silent. [Para 11][233-D-E] 3. The evidence of last seen becomes an extremely important piece of evidence in a case of circumstantial evidence, particularly when there is a close proximity of time between when the accused was last seen with the deceased and the discovery of G the body of the deceased, or in this case the time of the death of the deceased. This does not mean that in cases where there is a long gap between the time of last seen and the death of the deceased the last seen evidence loses its value. It would not, but H 222 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A then a very heavy burden is placed upon the prosecution to prove that during this period of last seen and discovery of the body of the deceased or the time of the death of the deceased, no other person but the accused could have had an access to the deceased. The circumstances of last seen together in the present case by itself cannot form the basis of guilt .The circumstances of last B seen together does not by itself lead to an irrevocable conclusion that it is the accused who had committed the crime. The prosecution must come out with something more to establish this connectivity with the accused and the crime committed. Particularly, in the present case when there is no close proximity C between circumstances of last seen together and the approximate time of death, the evidence of last seen becomes weak. [Para 12][233-E-G; 234-A-B] 4. As per the post-mortem which was conducted on 12.05.2000 at 4:15 P.M, the death was 48 hours prior to the post D mortem, which means it was before 4:00 P.M. on 10.05.2000. Even assuming that the death has taken place, a day earlier i.e. 09.05.2000, still there is a long gap between the last seen which is at 7:00 pm on 08.05.2000 and the morning of 09.05.2000. In this case, even if this court take the time between the last seen and the approximate time of death as per the post-mortem, which E would go beyond 48 hours preceding the time of post-mortem and the time of death can be stretched to the morning of May 9, 2000, which still begs an explanation from the prosecution as to the time gap, as the deceased was last seen with the two accused on 08.05.2000 at 7:00 P.M.
