Oka,* Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Augustine George Masih, JJ.] Issue for Consideration The appellant-Judicial Officer has preferred these appeals for expunging adverse findings/remarks recorded against him in the impugned dated 02.03.2023 by the Delhi High Court.

Digital Supreme Court Reports that the High Court Judges, after noticing improper conduct on the part of the Judicial Officer, can always invite the attention of the Chief Justice on the administrative side to such conduct – Whenever action is proposed against a judicial officer on the administrative side, he gets the full opportunity to clarify and explain his position – But if such personal adverse observations are made in a , the Judicial Officer’s career gets adversely affected – Thus, the High Court could not have used a on the judicial side to advise individual Judicial Officer – Therefore, the prayer made by the appellant for expunging remarks will have to be acceded to.
