431 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. and the impact on fundamental rights - On an overall comparison of the measure and the alternative, the alternative is better suited because it realizes the purposes to a considerable extent and imposes a lesser restriction on the fundamental rights — Having concluded that Clause 7(4) of the Scheme is not the least restrictive means to balance the fundamental rights, there is no necessity of applying the balancing prong of the proportionality standard. [Paras 160-164, 168] Doctrine/Principles — Doctrine of proportionality, when applied: Held: (Per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) Proportionality principle is applied by courts when they exercise their power of judicial review in cases involving a restriction on fundamental rights — It is applied to strike an appropriate balance between the fundamental right and the pursued purpose and objective of the restriction. [Para 24] Doctrine/Principles — Doctrine of proportionality — Application of proportionality test to Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018 - Legitimate purpose prong — Retribution, victimisation or retaliation, if can be treated as a legitimate aim: Held: (Per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) Retribution, victimisation or retaliation cannot by any stretch be treated as a legitimate aim — This would not satisfy the legitimate purpose prong of the proportionality test — Neither the Scheme nor the amendments to the Finance Act, 2017, rationally connected to the fulfilment of the purpose to counter retribution, victimisation or retaliation in political donations — It will also not satisfy the necessity stage of the proportionality even if the balancing stage is ignored - Retribution, victimisation or retaliation against any donor exercising their choice to donate to a political party is an abuse of law and power - This has to be checked and corrected — As it is a wrong, the wrong itself cannot be a justification or a purpose — Cloak of secrecy, leads to severe restriction and curtailment of the collective’s right to information and the right to know — Transparency and not secrecy is the cure and antidote. [Para 39] Doctrine/Principles — Doctrine of proportionality — Application of proportionality test to Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018 - Rational nexus prong: Held: (Per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) Donor may like to keep his identity anonymous is a mere ipse dixit assumption — Plea of infringement 432 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the right to privacy has no application at all if the donor makes the contribution, that too through a banking channel, to a political party — Identity of the purchaser of the Bond can always be revealed upon registration of a criminal case or by an /direction of the court — Thus, the fear of reprisal and vindictiveness does not end — So-called protection exists only on paper but in practical terms is not a good safeguard even if it is accepted that the purpose is legitimate — Under the Scheme, political parties in power may have asymmetric access to information with the authorised bank — They also retain the ability to use their power and authority of investigation to compel the revelation of Bond related information — Thus, the entire objective of the Scheme is contradictory and inconsistent — Rational connection test fails since the purpose of curtailing black or unaccounted-for money in the electoral process has no connection or relationship with the concealment of the identity of the donor - Payment through banking channels is easy and an existing antidote — On the other hand, obfuscation of the details may lead to unaccounted and laundered money getting legitimised.
