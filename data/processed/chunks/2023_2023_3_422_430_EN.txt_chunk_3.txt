C 2.10 That thereafter, by the impugned common , the National Commission has dismissed the respective Appeal Executions, which are the subject matter of the present appeals at the behest of the Developer. 3. Shri Sachin Datta, learned senior counsel has appeared on behalf of the Developer and Mrs. Rachna Joshi Issar along with Ms. Harvinder D Chowdhury, learned counsel have appeared on behalf of the Chandigarh Housing Board. 3.1 Shri Sachin Datta, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Developer has vehemently submitted that the impugned passed by the National Commission is just contrary to the decision of E this Court in Civil Appeal No. 10748/2016, titled Chandigarh Housing Board v. M/s Parasvanath Developers Pvt. Ltd., decided on 17.12.2019, wherein this Court had categorically held that clause 9(c), i.e., compensation on account of delay in construction is not applicable. F 3.2 It is submitted that in the present case, it was found that both the appellant – developer as well as the CHB were responsible for delay and therefore clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyer Agreement shall not be attracted, more particularly when there has been no fulfilment of conditions in clause 9(a). G 3.3 It is further submitted that even the impugned and /s is/are inconsistent with other s passed by the National Commission in similar Appeal Executions emanating from the same dated 08.05.2015, which was also the subject matter of First Appeals. It is submitted that even otherwise, in view of the arbitration award dated 09.01.2015 which attained finality, it provided that the liability to pay the H PARSVNATH DEVELOPERS LTD. v. GAGANDEEP BRAR AND 427 ANOTHER [M. R. SHAH, J.] amount to the buyers/allottees including the amount of compensation A shall be paid in the ratio of 70:30 and even this Court also while disposed of Civil Appeal No. 10748/2016 specifically observed that split of 70:30 under the arbitration award must be given effect, having attained finality. The impugned passed by the National Commission and even the State Commission directing the appellant-developer to pay the entire B amount of compensation is therefore unsustainable. 3.4 Making above submissions, it is prayed to allow the present appeals preferred by the Developer – Parsvnath Developers Ltd. 4. While opposing the present appeals, learned counsel appearing C on behalf of the CHB have vehemently submitted that under the Tripartite Agreement/Flat Buyer Agreement and as per clause 9(c), it is the exclusive liability of the developer to pay the compensation to the buyers/ allottees. It is submitted that the plain language of clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyer Agreement/Tripartite Agreement, which is a commercial D agreement, is binding upon the parties. 4.1 It is submitted that the liability to pay compensation under clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyer Agreement of the developer has been affirmed by this Court in the and dated 21.04.2015. E 4.2 Making above submissions and relying upon the s passed by this Court dated 21.04.2015 in Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos.17133-17134/2013 and other allied special leave petitions/civil appeals and the subsequent passed by this Court on 17.12.2019 in Civil Appeal No.
