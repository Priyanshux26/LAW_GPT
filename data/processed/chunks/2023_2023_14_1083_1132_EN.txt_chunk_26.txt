These committees’ functions under Section 25 are to oversee economic and social rehabilitation, coordinate the functions of all agencies to channelize adequate credit for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers and to monitor the registration of off ences and their investigation and prosecution under the 2013 Act. 78.

Survey Committees under Rule 11 are to be created at the State and District level. The function of the Committees is to oversee the survey process from its initiation to the publication of the list in the respective district/state. As per the data supplied to this Court, the State Level Survey Committee has been constituted only in Rajasthan, Karnataka and West Bengal as per the Union of India45. Further, District Level Survey Committee has been constituted only by Odisha. Obviously, a survey under the Act cannot take place without these Committees being constituted. IV. Hazardous Cleaning 80. Manual scavenging and hazardous cleaning are separately treated under the 2013 Act. A ‘Manual scavenger’ is defi ned under Section 2(g) as a: “(g) a person engaged or employed, … by an individual or a local authority or an agency or a contractor, for manual cleaning, carrying, disposing of, or otherwise handling in any manner, human excreta in an insanitary latrine or in an open drain or pit into which the human excreta from the insanitary latrines is disposed of, or on a railway track or in such other spaces or premises as the Central Government or State Government may notify, before the excreta fully decomposes in such manner as may be prescribed…” 81. A manual scavenger under the 2013 Act, therefore, is employed with respect to cleaning human excreta from an insanitary latrine or a similar place.
