Thereafter, the name of Zahoor was recorded as a member of the joint family in Khata No. 98. From the materials on record, the revisional authority noticed that Zahoor was in possession and paying rent in respect of the disputed land. However, the revisional authority accepted the contention of Sami Ullah that Zahoor had relinquished his share in respect of plot Nos. 35, 57, 111 and 112 by way of relinquishment deed of the year 1948. Deputy Director i.e. the revisional authority noted that relinquishment was by way of a relinquishment deed and that Zahoor had admitted his signature on it. Therefore, there was no reason to disbelieve the contention of Sami Ullah because in the year 1948, Zahoor had relinquished his share in plot Nos. 35, 57, 111 and 112. Further, possession of Zahoor Ahmed was also not recorded. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1865 Nisar Ahmad & Ors. v. Sami Ullah (Dead) Through Lrs. & Anr. Thus Zahoor Ahmed was held to be not entitled to any share in so far the said plots were concerned. The lower authorities had ignored the relinquishment deed which vitiated their respective s. On the basis of the relinquishment deed, the Deputy Director allowed the revision of Sami Ullah in respect of plot Nos. 35, 57, 111 and 112. As regards claim of Zahoor in respect of plot No. 115 of Khata No. 100, the Deputy Director was not convinced about the said claim. That being the position, the revisional authority upheld the view taken by the lower authorities and dismissed the revision of Zahoor Ahmed. 14.

High Court pointed out that the dispute was between the two branches of Abdul Ghafoor and Abdul Shakoor. Petitioners of Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 6635 of 1974 i.e. the appellants represented the branch of Abdul Shakoor. The contesting respondents of the said writ petition i.e. respondents herein represented the branch of Abdul Ghafoor.
