[2024] 9 S.C.R. 227 Manilal v. The State of Rajasthan & Ors. Hence, the learned Single Judge rightly held that the case of the respondent was liable to be considered for appointment as Teacher Grade-III, Level-Il as per his competitive merit in the category subject to his fulfilling other requirements eligibility on his application in pursuance of advertisement dated 31.07.2018.” (Emphasis supplied) The Special Leave Petition (C) No. 15793/2020 filed by the State against the in Ankul Singhal (supra) was dismissed by this Court on 01.02.2021. 12. By an of 23.10.2021, in the appellant’s D.B. Spl. Appl. Writ No. 997 of 2019, relying on the NCTE notification of 13.11.2019, an interim was passed directing the respondents to accord appointment to the appellant on the post of Teacher Gade-III pursuant to the Advertisement No. 02 of 2017 in question for TSP Area (English subject), if otherwise eligible. It is not disputed that the appellant has, pursuant to the interim was appointed. Thereafter, it is contended that after the impugned , the appellant’s appointment was cancelled on 07.06.2022. 13. On 10.03.2022, the D.B. Spl. Appl. Writ No. 224 of 2019 of Rakesh Gaur (supra), who was identically situated, was allowed by relying on the Division Bench in Ankul Singhal (supra). In fact, the said Rakesh Gaur has taken admission on 05.11.2009, after the appellant herein. 14. However, when the appeal of the appellant came up on 27.04.2022, by relying on D.B. Civil Special Appeal (Writ) No. 1205 of 2019 (Dinesh Chandra Damor vs. State of Rajasthan), the appeal was dismissed. The appellant herein had joined the course on 23.10.2009 whereas as is clear from the facts of Dinesh Chandra Damor (supra) that candidate has joined on 20.10.2010 i.e. one year and two months (approx.) after the cut-off date of 31.08.2009. 15. The appellant’s case was more akin to the case of Rakesh Gaur (supra), who had taken admission on 05.11.2009. We are clearly of the opinion on the special facts of this case that the Division Bench erred in applying the case of Dinesh Chandra Damor (supra) instead of applying the reasoning in the in Ankul Singhal (supra) and Rakesh Gaur (supra) to the facts of this case. As was held in 228 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Ankul Singhal (supra), it will be improper to discriminate inter se among a homogenous group of students admitted for the academic session 2009-10. As was pointed out therein, it could not be that those students admitted in the first round of counselling would be eligible, even with less than 50% marks in graduation, while the others admitted in the subsequent rounds of counselling would not be. It was on this reasoning that Rakesh Gaur (supra) was given relief. Rakesh Gaur (supra) was a case identically situated with the case of the appellant. What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander too. 16. In view of the same, we allow the appeal and set aside the impugned of the High Court dated 27.04.2022 in D.B.
