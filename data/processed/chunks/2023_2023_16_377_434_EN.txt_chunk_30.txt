A statute must be construed in such a manner so as to ensure that the Act itself does not become a dead letter and the obvious intention of the legislature does not stand defeated unless it leads to a case of absolute intractability in use. The court must adopt a construction which suppresses the mischief and advances the remedy and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and pro privato commodo, and to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true intent of the makers of the Act, pro bono publico. The court must give eff ect to the purpose and object of the Act for the reason that legislature is presumed 422 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. to have enacted a reasonable statute. (Vide M. Pentiah v. Muddala Veeramallappa [AIR 1961 SC 1107], S.P. Jain v. Krishna Mohan Gupta [(1987) 1 SCC 191], RBI v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. [(1987) 1 SCC 424], Tinsukhia Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of Assam [(1989) 3 SCC 709], SCC p. 754, para 118, UCO Bank v. Rajinder Lal Capoor [(2008) 5 SCC 257] and Grid Corpn. of Orissa Ltd. v. Eastern Metals and Ferro Alloys [(2011) 11 SCC 334].) 57. Thus, in view of the aforesaid, we hold that the outer age limit of sixty years provided in sub-section (9) of Section 10 of the Act 1996 will not apply, when it comes to reappointment under sub-section (10) of Section 10 of the Act 1996. iii) Whether the reappointment of the Vice-Chancellor has to follow the same process as a fresh appointment under Section 10 of the Act 1996? 58. Reappointment of Vice-Chancellor has been provided under sub- section (10) of Section 10 of the Act 1996. The proviso to sub-section (10) of the Act 1996 further makes the intention of the legislature to provide for reappointment more clear. The legislature has not thought fi t to prescribe any particular procedure or any particular mode or manner of reappointment. The UGC Regulations are also silent as regards the reappointment of Vice- Chancellor. 59. The language of sub-section (10) of Section 10 of the Act 1996 is plain and simple. The provision does not confer right to seek reappointment. There is only one way of reading the provision, which is, that a Vice- Chancellor once appointed, subject to the proviso to sub-section (10) of Section 10, is eligible to be considered for reappointment. What this implies is that an incumbent Vice-Chancellor may not have to reapply along with other candidates and compete for the same position once again. Reappointment essentially means the incumbent Vice-Chancellor would receive another term of four years if the Chancellor deems fi t without reopening the position for new applications or without constituting a select committee. “Re” means again, and is freely used as prefi x. It gives colour of “again” to the verb with which it is placed. “Reappointment” is an act or process of being appointed again.
