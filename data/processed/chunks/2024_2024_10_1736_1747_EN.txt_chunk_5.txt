11. Continuing further, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that denial of grant of interest to the appellants is contrary to the stand taken by the State in the writ proceedings, in which, the Learned Single Judge passed the s dated 30.11.2016 on the basis of the undertaking given by the State Counsel that the revised pension is allowed to the appellants, who had retired prior to 01.01.2006 and the Government shall pay interest on the delayed payment. Thus, it 1744 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports is urged that in terms of the s dated 30.11.2016 passed in CWP No.8988 of 2015 etc. cases, the appellants were entitled to revised pension along with interest on the delayed payment. 12. It is also pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellants that in the Contempt Petition bearing COCP No.2846 of 2017 in CWP No. 8988 of 2015, titled as Banarsi Dass and Ors. v. Jyoti Arora and another, an affidavit was filed by Mrs. Jyoti Arora, Additional Chief Secretary to the Government of Haryana, Higher Education Department, Chandigarh, on 01.05.2018 stating inter alia that the writ petitioners therein are entitled to interest from the date of issuance of the Policy dated 12.10.2010 by the Principal Secretary, Higher Education, Government of Haryana, regarding revision of pension/ family pension of the retirees of Non-Government Affiliated Aided Colleges in the State; and accordingly, interest at 9% was calculated w.e.f. 12.10.2010. However, on 22.10.2018, an additional affidavit dated 22.10.2018 was filed by the said Mrs. Jyoti Arora, stating that the writ petitioners therein are not entitled to any interest. Thus, the respondent authorities have taken different stand at every stage of the proceedings, thereby depriving the appellants from getting their legitimate claim of interest on the delayed payment. Without properly appreciating the same, the High Court erred in allowing the State’s appeals by setting aside the s of the learned Single Judge in respect of grant of interest on the delayed payment to the appellants and hence, the same is liable to be quashed. 13. Opposing the claim of the appellants, the learned counsel for the State / respondent(s) made the following submissions: (i) Rule 6 of the Rules, 2009 specifically deals with the case of Retired Government employees and there is no provision in the Rules, 2009 to award interest for any belated payment; (ii) Earlier and present litigations only pertain to grant of revised pension to the Government College Lecturers and Private Aided College Lecturers, both on the basis of 2009 Rules; (iii) The pay scale revisions are retrospective in nature and are without interest; (iv) interest cannot be offered, based on equitable considerations;8 and (v) Concessions made by a Government counsel cannot be granted, unless there are written 8 Union of India and Others v. Dr. J K Goel (1995) Supp. 3 SCC 161 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1745 K.C. Kaushik and Others v. State of Haryana and Others instructions from a responsible officer.9 Thus, the learned counsel submitted that considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court correctly denied the grant of interest on the delayed payment, which does not call for any interference by this court.
