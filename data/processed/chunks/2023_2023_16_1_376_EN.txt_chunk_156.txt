…” (emphasis supplied) 372. Clause (2) of Article 368 provides that the Constitution may be amended when a Bill for the purpose is passed in each House of Parliament by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting. However, an amendment which seeks to make any “change” to certain specifi ed provisions is required to be ratifi ed by the legislatures of not less than one-half of the States in the manner provided, before the Bill is presented to the President for assent. A long line of cases concerning Article 368 of the Constitution have prioritised the substance or eff ect of an amendment while testing whether the proviso to Article 368 would be attracted. 373. In Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India,262 this Court adjudicated whether the Constitution (First Amendment) Act 1951, by which Articles 31-A and 31-B were inserted in the Constitution of India was ultra vires. One of the arguments advanced by the petitioners in this case was that the concerned Bill ought to have been ratifi ed in terms of the procedure 262 1951 SCC 966 222 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. contemplated by the proviso to Article 368(2) because the impugned articles curtailed the powers of the High Courts under Article 226 and of this Court under Articles 132 and 136. Rejecting this argument, this Court held that the impugned articles did not make any change to Articles 226, 132 or 136: “17. It will be seen that these Articles do not either in terms or in eff ect seek to make any change in Article 226 or in Articles 132 and 136. …” (emphasis supplied) 374. In Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan,263 this Court adjudicated the validity of the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act 1964 by which Article 31-A was amended and forty-four statutes were added to the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. Here too, one of the questions was whether the procedure prescribed by the proviso to Article 368 ought to have been followed. This Court rejected the challenge: “14. … The impugned Act does not purport to change the provisions of Article 226 and it cannot be said even to have that eff ect directly or in any appreciable measure. That is why we think that the argument that the impugned Act falls under the proviso, cannot be sustained. It is an Act the object of which is to amend the relevant Articles in Part III which confer fundamental rights on citizens and as such it falls under the substantive part of Article 368 and does not attract the provisions of clause (b) of the proviso. If the eff ect of the amendment made in the fundamental rights on Article 226 is direct and not incidental and is of a very signifi cant , diff erent considerations may perhaps arise. But in the present case, there is no occasion to entertain or weigh the said considerations.” (emphasis supplied) 375.
