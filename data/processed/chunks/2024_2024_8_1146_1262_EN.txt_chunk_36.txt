The said Certificate refers to the MoU dated 20th December, 2008 and states that the rejects generated in the process of washing of coal undertaken by GCWL at their washery at Majiri during 2009-10, is owned by GCWL. 5.16 Lastly, learned counsel for the respondent-CBI has canvassed that the findings returned in a civil proceeding are not binding in a prosecution founded on similar allegations and it is for the criminal Court to arrive at any decision on its own and not to reach any conclusion by reference to any previous decisions relating to the parties which cannot be treated as binding upon it. In support of the said submission, he has cited The King Emperor v. Khawaja Nazir Ahmed.67 It has thus been argued by the respondent-CBI that the present appeals are devoid of merits and deserve to be dismissed. 5.17 On the scope of Section 227, Cr.P.C. and the power of the Special Judge to pass an of discharge, learned counsel for the respondent-CBI has cited the decisions in Union of India v. Prafulla Kumar Samal and Another 68 and Niranjan Singh Karam Singh v. Jitendra Bhimraj Bijjaya And Others.69 The decisions in State of Maharashtra v. Som Nath Thapa,70 State of Tamil Nadu v. N. Suresh Rajan and Others71 have been relied on to make a point that at the stage of framing of charges, the Court cannot appraise the evidence as is done at the time of trial and the Court must proceed on an assumption that the materials brought on record by the prosecution are 67 AIR (1945) PC 18 68 [1979] 2 SCR 229 : (1979) 3 SCC 4 69 [1990] 3 SCR 633 : (1990) 4 SCC 76 70 [1996] Supp. 1 SCR 189 : (1996) 4 SCC 659 71 [2014] 1 SCR 135 : (2014) 11 SCC 709 1210 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports true. Alluding to the in State of Bihar v. Ramesh Singh,72 learned counsel submitted that at the initial stage of the trial, if there is a strong suspicion that gives an impression to the Court for drawing a presumption that the accused has committed an offence, it is not open for the Court to state that there is insufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. 5.18 Both sides have also relied on K.G. Premshanker v. Inspector of Police and Another 73 which discusses the effect of a decision of a civil Court on criminal proceedings against the same person pertaining to the same cause in the context of Sections 40 to 43 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 as to which s of the courts are relevant and the extent of the relevance. 6.
