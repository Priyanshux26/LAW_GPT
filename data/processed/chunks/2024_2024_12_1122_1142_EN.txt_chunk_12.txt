24. The Committee has also stressed the importance of undertaking public education programmes highlighting the negative impact of accusations of witchcraft, targeting both men and women, as well as community and villages chiefs and religious leaders, and raising awareness, particularly in rural areas, of the criminal nature of such attacks. It has also noted the need for special programmes that address the psychological trauma, physical harm, social exclusion and impoverishment of women accused of witchcraft, and allocate adequate resources to victim support structures.” 26. In the preceding paragraphs, we have discussed the variety of legislations, judicial pronouncements and other relevant literature pertaining to, in particular, the allegations of witchcraft and, in general, the protection of women against discrimination and exploitation. It is not lost on us that the impugned before us has been rendered null by subsequent withdrawal; however, given the peculiarity of the situation and the vulgarity of the actions alleged, we adopted the course as above. 27. Keeping in view the aforesaid, we issue the following : (1) The matter is placed on the file of the concerned District Court to proceed in accordance with the law. 1142 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (2) The Trial against the accused persons shall proceed on a day- to-day basis. (3) The accused persons are directed to appear before the Trial Court on 15th January 2025. (4) It stands clarified that comments made hereinabove reflect only the heinousness of the crimes committed and do not in any way cast a shadow of guilt over the accused persons. (5) The Trial shall proceed keeping in view the aforesaid principles but uninfluenced by any observations made in this . Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
