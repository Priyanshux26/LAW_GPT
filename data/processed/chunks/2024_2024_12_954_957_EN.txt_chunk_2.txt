The judicious approach would have been to convert the petition under Section 482 CrPC into a revision under Section 397 CrPC and to have decided the same as per law. 11. In view of the above, we dispose of the appeal by setting aside the impugned of the High Court dated 21.09.2023 and remand the matter to the High Court with further direction to convert the petition under Section 482 CrPC as a criminal revision under Section 397 CrPC and decide it in accordance with law after affording opportunity of hearing to the parties. 12. The appeal stands disposed of accordingly. 13. Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
