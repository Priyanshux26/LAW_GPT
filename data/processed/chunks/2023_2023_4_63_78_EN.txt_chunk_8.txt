It is the case on behalf of the appellant that as the aforesaid G products are manufactured under the licence granted under the Insecticides Act and therefore the said products can be said to be insecticides classifiable under Entry 44(5). The aforesaid has no substance. It is required to be noted that HSN Code 3808 has been deleted from Entry 44(5) w.e.f. 01.07.2006 and from 21.01.2006 the aforesaid products would fall under Sl. No.66 namely ‘Mosquito H M/S RECKITT BENCKISER (INDIA) LTD. v. COMMISSIONER 75 COMMERCIAL TAXES & ORS. [M. R. SHAH, J.] repellant’, which is the specific entry and subject to VAT at 12.5%. The A insecticides under Entry 44(5) therefore can be said to be a general entry. Once there is a specific entry the ‘Mosquito Repellant’, thereafter one is not required to go to the definition under another Act namely Insecticides Act. Sl.No.66 of Notification SRO 82/06 dated 21.01.2006 issued under Section 6(1)(d) of the Kerala VAT Act which covers B “Mosquito Repellants”. 9.1 Even otherwise it is required to be noted that Entry 44(5) which includes insecticides relates to products which are used in agricultural operations. All the products in the Entry are used in the agricultural field in relation to growing of agricultural products and C controlling of pets, insecticides etc. which are attacking the plants. Therefore, in view of the specific Entry 66 of Notification SRO 82/06 dated 21.01.2006 the aforesaid products namely Mosquito Repellants, electric or electronic mosquito repellants, gadgets and insect repellants, devices and parts and accessories thereof are rightly classified as Mosquito repellants. Now so far as the reliance placed upon the decision D of this Court in the case of Bombay Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. (supra) is concerned, the said decision shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand while dealing with the specific entries under KVAT Act. It was a case under the Central Excise Act and the Entry corresponding to the Excise Act. In the present case under the KVAT Act there is a E specific Entry Mosquito repellant so far as the product electric or electronic mosquito repellents, gadgets and insect repellents, devices and parts and accessories thereof are concerned and therefore the said specific entry shall be applicable in any case, the same cannot be said to be insecticides. We are in complete agreement with the view taken by F the High Court that Mosquito Mats, Coils and Vaporizers and Mortein Insect Killers products shall not be classifiable under Entry 44(5) as insecticides. 9.2 Now so far as the products Harpic and Lizol is concerned, it is the case on behalf of the appellant that the same is classifiable under G Entry 44(5) of III Schedule of KVAT Act - HSN Code 3808 and the said products are also classifiable as insecticides. 9.3 However, it is required to be noted that after introduction of SRO 82/06 w.e.f. 22.01.2006 the Harpic and Lizol would fall under Sl. No. 27(4) of SRO 82/06. Sl. No.27(4) thus is a specific entry.
