34. In our view, the view taken by the APTEL cannot be said to A be a view taken in ignorance of the mandatory statutory provisions nor can it be said that it is based on extraneous considerations. The view also cannot be said to be ex-facie arbitrary or illegal. As such, in our view, no interference would be warranted in the present appeals. 35. In the result, the appeals are dismissed. Pending application(s), B if any, shall stand disposed of. No costs. Divya Pandey Appeals dismissed. (Assisted by : Shevali Monga, LCRA) C D E F G H
