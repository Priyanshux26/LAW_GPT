[Paras 25, 26, 36, 40, 44] Stamp Act, 1899 – s.35 – Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.61, 63, 65 – Secondary evidence in proof of its contents forbidden – Plaintiff and Defendant entered into an agreement to sell – Defendant denied the existence of the agreement – Plaintiff fi led suit for specifi c performance of contract, moved an application to fi le a copy of the agreement to sell, among other documents, as secondary evidence – Plaintiff claimed that after executing the document, Defendant kept the original copy, and a photocopy of the same was given to Plaintiff – However, as per the averments made in the application, the Defendant had stated in an affi davit that the documents were not with her but with her counsel – Trial Court and the High Court relied on Jupadi Kesava Rao to hold VIJAY v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 295 that the Plaintiff s cannot lead secondary evidence as the document sought to be produced needed to be duly stamped: Held: s.35 of the Stamp Act forbids the letting of secondary evidence in proof of its contents – The section excludes both the original instrument and secondary evidence of its contents if it needs to be stamped or suffi ciently stamped – This bar as to the admissibility of documents is absolute – Where a document cannot be received in evidence on the ground that it is not duly stamped, the secondary evidence thereof is equally inadmissible in evidence – Jupadi Kesava Rao is distinguishable on facts as the document which the Court was concerned with therein was one which was chargeable with duty, but in the present case, such is not the case as the document to be produced is not one which was chargeable with duty at the time of its execution i.e., 04.02.1988 – This being a material diff erence, the principle of law held in this case, correct as it may be, shall not apply to the instant case. [Paras 36, 40] Stamp Act, 1899 – ss.35, 2(6): Held: s.35 prohibits admission in evidence of instruments that are chargeable with duty unless they are “duly stamped – The word ‘chargeable,’ as defi ned u/s.2(6), means chargeable under the Act in force at the date of the execution of the instrument – The crucial date which determines the law in force is the date of execution of the instrument, and the stamp duty is to be charged with reference to the date of execution – For stamp duty, the relevant date is the date of execution and not the date of adjudication or the date of presentation and registration of the document. [Paras 9, 11] Interpretation of Statutes – Role of a clarifi cation/explanation to a statute and how the same is identifi ed and distinguished from a substantive amendment – Discussed. Stamp/Stamp Duty – Question as to whether the document is liable to stamp duty and penalty, to be decided at the threshold: Held: It is a settled position of law that where the question is whether the document is liable to stamp duty and penalty, it has to be decided at the threshold even before marking a document – In the present case, the document in question was not liable to stamp duty – Deeds and Documents.
