15. | fully agree with the Hon’ble Chief Justice, that the Scheme cannot be tested on the parameters applicable to economic policy. Matters of 47 Paragraph 8(1) of the Scheme. 48 Paragraph 8(2) of the Scheme. 49 Paragraph 14 of the Scheme. 50 Paragraph 12 of the Scheme. 51 Paragraph 13 of the Scheme. 52 For short, “the Constitution”. 53 The Finance Act, 2017 was introduced and passed as a money bill by the Parliament under Article 110 of the Constitution. 54 Rojer Matthew v. South Indian Bank Ltd. and Ors., [20116 9SC]R 1 : Civil Appeal No. 8588 of 2019. [2024] 2 S.C.R. 579 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. economic policy normally pertain to trade, business and commerce, whereas contributions to political parties relate to the democratic polity, citizens’ right to know and accountability in our democracy. The primary objective of the Scheme, and relevant amendments introduced by the Finance Act, 2017, is electoral reform and not economic reform. Thus, the dictum and the principles enunciated by this Court in Swiss Ribbons (2) Ltd. and Another v. Union of India and Others, and Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure and Another ५ Union of India and Others,” relating to judicial review on economic policy matters have no application to the present case. To give the legislation the latitude of economic policy, we will be diluting the principle of free and fair elections. Clearly, the importance of the issue and the nexus between money and electoral democracy requires us to undertake an in-depth review, albeit under the settled powers of judicial review. 16. Even otherwise, it is wrong to state as a principle that judicial review cannot be exercised over every matter pertaining to economic policy.°’ The law is that the legislature has to be given latitude in matters of economic policy as they involve complex financial issues. *® The degree of deference to be shown by the court while exercising the power of judicial review cannot be put in a straitjacket. 17. On the question of burden of proof, | respectfully agree with the observations made by the Hon’ble Chief Justice, that once the petitioners are able to prima facie establish a breach of a fundamental right, then the onus is on the State to show that the right limiting measure pursues a proper purpose, has rational nexus with that purpose, the means adopted were necessary for achieving that purpose, and lastly proper balance has been incorporated. 18. The doctrine of presumption of constitutionality has its limitations when we apply the test of proportionality. In a way the structured proportionality places an obligation on the State at a higher level, as it is a polycentric examination, both empirical and normative.
