[Para 1.10] Contempt of Court – Execution of decree – Alternate remedy: Held: The weapon of contempt will not be used for execution of the decree or implementation of an for which alternative remedy in law is provided for – The paramount consideration is given to maintain court’s dignity and majesty of law.
