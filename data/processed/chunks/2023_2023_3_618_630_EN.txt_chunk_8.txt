85.66 crores to the Assessee company, was treated as sufficient to establish the relationship between the Assessee and the D buyers. That only shows one way traffic whereas requirement is that of two way traffic. The other Member, in our opinion, aptly held that this cannot be the factor which would show the mutuality of interest…” 15. In Kwality Ice Cream (supra)again, the court underlined the E interdependence and mutuality of business interests of the two entities, viz. the assessee and the buyer: “On analysis of the decisions referred to herein above, it appears what is important is that each of the parties involved should have an interest, whether direct or indirect in the F business of each other. The following are the relevant clauses of the agreement between M/s. Kwality Ice Cream and BBLIL/ HLL based on which and applying the principles referred to herein above, a view is required to be taken as to whether they are ‘related persons’. G ************* ************* What is of importance is certain interdependence and reciprocity beyond the relationship of either a distributor or H 6 (2015) 11 SCC 646 M/S BILAG INDUSTRIES P. LTD. v. COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. 629 DAMAN [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] manufacturer so as to consider as to whether the parties are A ‘related persons’. On the facts it is noticed, essentially the relationship between M/s. Kwality Ice Cream and BBLIL/HLL is one sided and the facts do not suggest that each one of them have interest direct or indirect, in the business of each other.” B 16. On the other hand, if one were to consider what constitutes inter-relationship, the decision in Supreme Washers Pvt. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise, Pune7, is instructive. The assessee and the buyer were involved in common procurement of raw material; they had common stock accounting and planning and interdependence C in manufacturing operations. This court held that holding common stock of raw material and semi-finished goods, with common use of machinery between the three units, with common marketing arrangements and free flow of finance between the three units, cumulatively established the assessees’ inter relationships and interdependence of all three units with each other. D 17. In the present case, undoubtedly AgrEvo SA/ Aventis CropScience SA holds the entire shareholding in Aventis CropScience (India) Ltd. (the buyer). It also is a shareholder in BIL. All of the latter’s products are sold to Aventis CropScience (India) Ltd. However, this does not show that BIL has any business interest or interest in the affairs E of Aventis CropScience (India) Ltd., nor, conversely, that Aventis CropScience (India) Ltd has any such interest, direct or indirectly in BIL. The revenue’s concern in examining whether the parties were related might be justified; however, it could not have concluded that such relationship, as is contemplated by Section 4(4)(c) could have been F inferred, without applying the proper test. Additionally, the revenue had the materials before it, in the form of documents which indicated the mark up towards profit margin, and other objective evidence to compare, if indeed, the cost of the goods sold, were depressed, or were comparable to the market price of the same or similar goods.
