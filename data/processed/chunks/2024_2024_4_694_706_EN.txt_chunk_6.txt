V. Since there was no decree against Saeeduddin, as such Decree holder could not have any right of getting possession of the portion of the property which was admittedly in possession of Saeeduddin and owner. Further, the tenants of Saeeduddin in the disputed property were tenants of the applicant-objector Akhtar Un Nisa-respondent no.1. 6. The Executing Court, vide and dated 03.05.2007, dismissed the objections under Section 47 CPC filed by Smt.Akhtar Un Nisa. 7. Aggrieved by the same, Smt.Akhtar Un Nisa preferred a revision before the High Court which has since been allowed by the impugned giving rise to the present appeal. 8. After careful consideration of the arguments presented by both sides, this Court believes that the High Court erred in setting aside the Executing Court’s dated 09.12.1998 and in declaring the Trial Court’s decree dated 09.05.1979 void. The High Court’s 704 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports decision appears to be based on several incorrect assumptions and observations. 9. The core of the High Court’s reasoning rests on the erroneous assumption that the property was jointly owned by Defendants No. 1 and No. 2, and that the absence of Defendant No. 2’s signature on the compromise dated 11.05.1978 invalidated the decree. However, Defendant No. 2 has consistently acknowledged that he had no ownership rights over the property. In his written statement to the Trial Court in Suit No. 13/72, he explicitly stated that the property belonged solely to Defendant No. 1. This was further supported by a family arrangement dated 17.09.1976 and reinforced in Paragraph 6 of the compromise deed. The compromise, signed by Defendant No. 1 and the plaintiff and later verified by Defendant No. 2 through an application dated 14.05.1979, substantiates that Defendant No. 1 was the sole owner. These facts were upheld by the High Court and this Court in previous proceedings. During the challenge to the execution proceedings filed by General Tarik before the High Court, the High Court vide dated 11.8.2006 had also recorded the finding that Defendant no.2 did not have ownership rights over the suit property which fact was also upheld by this Court. Defendant no. 2 had limited rights of being in possession of the third floor of suit property. Due to the aforesaid reasons, the Plaintiff and Defendant no. 1 were the only necessary parties needed for the compromise dated 11.05.1978 as Defendant no.1 was the sole owner of the suit property. 10. The High Court also incorrectly held that the provisions of XXIII, Rule 3 of the CPC were not adhered to, claiming that the Trial Court failed to properly verify the compromise. It is essential to clarify that the compromise was indeed reached on 11.05.1978, with its verification delayed due to various adjournments caused by the absence or illness of Defendant No.1 and other procedural delays. On 09.05.1979, a fresh compromise application containing identical terms was submitted and duly signed by both parties due to the original being misplaced. The Trial Court then correctly recorded and verified this compromise, fulfilling the requirements of XXIII, Rule 3 of the CPC.
