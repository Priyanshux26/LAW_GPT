The grievance raised by the appellants-claimants is that the High Court has denied interest to them for the period between 22.06.2016 to 13.07.2023. 1 MACA no.1072 of 2015 2 High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1145 T.C. John @ Yohannan (Deceased) Through Lrs. v. V.J. Antony and Others 3. The facts as available on record in brief are that the accident took place on 07.08.2006 when the deceased was travelling in his jeep along with his wife(now widow) and children and a bus hit their jeep, resulting in death of the deceased. The appellants-claimants, consisting of deceased’s widow and three daughters, filed claim appeal3 before the Tribunal4 seeking compensation of ₹15,00,000/-. The Tribunal passed an award of ₹4,15,000/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annum in favour of the appellants-claimants, making the driver, owner and the insurance company of the bus liable to pay the same. 4. Aggrieved against the award dated 18.11.2011 passed by the Tribunal, the appellants-claimants filed appeal before the High Court. There was a delay of 708 days in filing the appeal. The same was condoned vide dated 24.08.2023 with the condition that on the enhanced compensation, if allowed, the appellants-claimants will not be entitled to claim interest for the period of delay of 708 days. Further the period for which there was delay in service of copy of paper book upon the standing counsel for the insurance company shall be decided at the time of final disposal of the appeal. 5. The High Court partly accepted the appeal while enhancing the compensation further by an amount of ₹9,84,500/- along with interest @ 8% per annum. It was directed that appellants-claimants shall not be entitled to the interest for the delay period of 708 days in filing the appeal as was directed vide dated 24.08.2023. Further appellants-claimants were not allowed interest for the period between 22.06.2016 to 13.07.2023, which was the period of delay in supplying the copy of paper book to the standing counsel for the insurance company. 6. Learned counsel for the appellants-claimants submitted that the appellants-claimants are poor and illiterate persons. The deceased was the only bread earner for the family, working as driver, died leaving behind his widow and three daughters as his dependents. The family was having a hard time to make both ends meet. The amount of compensation as assessed is on lower side as the income of the deceased was not assessed properly and hence, appropriate 3 OP (MV) no.655 of 2007 4 Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal, Thalassery 1146 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports compensation was not awarded. It was further argued that the appeal having been filed before High Court, there had been a delay in the process on account of the fault of the counsel of appellants-claimants, which should not be taken against the appellants-claimants as they were not at fault. Hence, the insurance company should be made liable to pay interest on the enhanced compensation. The appellants- claimants should not be deprived of interest for the period between 22.06.2016 to 13.07.2023.
