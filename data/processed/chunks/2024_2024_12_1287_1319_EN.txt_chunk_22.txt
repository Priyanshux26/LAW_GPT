Thus, any amount of plea raised by the contemnors on the ground of financial hardship or otherwise would be in contravention of the passed by this Court on 21.11.2014, 17.05.2022 and 19.03.2024. Hence, we are of the considered view that the State and its instrumentalities and/ or the competent authority being the BBMP is required to issue the TDR as per the then prevailing guidance value fixed under Section 45B of Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957 namely 2,83,500 per sq. meter for Bellary Road and 2,04,000 per sq. meter for Jayamahal road as indicated under the notifications issued under Section 45B of the Karnataka Stamp Act. 23. Yet the fact remains that subsequent to the same the State has calculated the value of the TDR in terms of the dated 22.04.2024 and 06.06.2024 as approved by the provisional acceptance dated 07.06.2024, the correctness of which cannot be subject matter of the present contempt proceedings and the value of subject land as determined thereunder has not been accepted by this Court for the reasons already indicated supra. No doubt by way of attempting to purge in the contempt, these s have been passed. The State and its authorities have no doubt dragged their feet in implementing the s of the Court. However, there seems to be thin line of doubt which has arisen in the mind of State and its authorities as regards the valuation and in this direction if steps have been taken to protect the interest of the revenue and several meetings have been held and these aspects are placed before the State Cabinet and a decision has been taken by the State cabinet, it cannot be construed or held that State is not willing to implement the and particularly in the background of several s having been passed though not in consonance with the s dated 21.11.2014 and 17.05.2022. Hence, we deem it proper to extend one final opportunity to report compliance within a time frame. 24. Since we have opined that the State and its authorities have intentionally dragged its feet for long number of years and having attempted to tap all the mirage remedies and left with no other option 1318 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports and to stave off these proceedings have passed the s dated 15.03.2024, 22.04.2024, 24.05.2024 and 10.06.2024 to utilise the subject land for road widening, fixing the extent to which each of the claimants would be entitled for compensation and to issue the TDR on an estimate value which is not accepted by this Court, still an opportunity to issue TDR’s as per market value as envisaged under Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957 as observed hereinabove ought to be extended to the respondents/contemnors. 25. Hence, we direct the respondent authorities to issue the TDR as per the value noticed hereinabove in favour of the respective claimants within six (6) weeks from today. We also make it abundantly clear that issuance of the TDR certificates would be subject to further s that may be passed by this Court while disposing of the appeals which are pending before the larger Bench and both parties are at liberty to bring this fact to the notice of the court adjudicating the appeals.
