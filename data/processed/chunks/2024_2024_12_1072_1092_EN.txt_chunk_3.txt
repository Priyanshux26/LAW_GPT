PW-8 Dr. Kalpesh Kumar who led the postmortem team has categorically opined that the cause of death was asphyxia due to throttling. In view of this, there is no iota of doubt that the deceased had a homicidal death. The only question that arises is as to whether there is any evidence against the appellant to convict him for the offences charged. 8. The appellant was arrested (at about 20:45 hrs. to 21:26 hrs.) on 14.04.2016 and his medical examination revealed that there were injury marks on his genitals as spoken to by PW-7 Dr. Kamlesh Kumar. 9. The prosecution attempts to rely on the discovery panchnama (Exh.18) to reinforce their case that it was pursuant to the appellant’s statement that the place of occurrence was discovered.
