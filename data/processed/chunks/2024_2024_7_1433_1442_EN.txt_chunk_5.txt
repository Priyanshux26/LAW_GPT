The Accident Claims Tribunal was justified in factoring these components into the salary of the deceased, before applying 50% rise by future prospects due to future prospects, while calculating the total compensation payable to the appellant. 11. Clearly, the High Court erred in accepting the appeal filed by the respondent No. 1- Insurance Company and reducing the compensation payable to the appellant from a sum of ₹ 1,04,01,000/- (Rupees One crore four lakh one thousand only) awarded by the Accident Claims Tribunal to ₹ 49,57,035/-(Rupees Forty nine lakh fifty seven thousand and thirty five only). [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1441 Meenakshi v. The Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. 12. We, therefore, hold that the High Court has erred while omitting to add the components of house rent allowance, flexible benefit plan and Company contribution to provident fund to the basic salary of the deceased while applying the principle of rise in income by future prospects. 13. However, we are of the opinion that the High Court was justified in deducting Income Tax from the gross salary of the deceased- Suryakanth for calculating his gross income. This factor was overlooked by the Accident Claims Tribunal while quantifying the award. 14. As a result, the re-assessed compensation payable to the appellant after making deduction towards Income Tax is tabulated in the following manner: - S. No. Heads Amount 1. Loss of Dependency Monthly Salary of the Deceased - - ₹ 50,942/- (inclusive of house rent allowance, flexible benefit plan and contribution to provident fund). (Less) Professional Tax of ₹ 200/month ₹ 50,742/- to be deducted (₹ 50,942-₹ 200) (Less) Income Tax @ 10% as per 2013- ₹ 45,668/- 2014 i.e., Rs. 5,074 (₹ 50,742 – ₹ 5,074) Annual Gross Income (₹ 45,668 x 12) ₹ 5,48,016/- (Less) 50% to be deducted towards ₹ 2,74,008/- dependency as the deceased was unmarried (₹ 5,48,016 – ₹ 2,74,008) (Add) 50% to be added towards rise in ₹ 5,48,016/- income by future prospects (₹ 5,48,016 + ₹ 2,74,008) Total Loss of Dependency = ₹ 5,48,016 ₹ 93,16,272/- X 17 (Multiplier as the deceased age was 26) 1. Funeral Expenses ₹ 25,000/- 2. Loss of Love and Affection ₹ 25,000/- Total Compensation ₹ 93,66,272 1442 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 15.
