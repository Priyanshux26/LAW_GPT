29. It was averred that an Explanation to a provision should not be such as would operate as an exception or a proviso vide Aphali F Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra, (1989) 4 SCC 378. That the Explanation to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961, in effect, acts as an exception to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 by excluding from the scope of the provision migrants/settlers of Indian origin who had settled in Sikkim much prior to the coming into effect of G the 1961 Regulation. 30. It was submitted that in the present case, in to remove the arbitrary discrimination against Indian settlers in Sikkim, the definition of the term ‘Sikkimese’ should be read to include Indians who had settled there as on 26th April, 1975. That this Court, in to remedy the H 334 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A discrimination against the writ petitioners, ought to put the Indian settlers in Sikkim in the same class as Sikkim Subjects, for the purposes of all matters which would affect the rights, benefits and privileges of such class of persons. 31. As regards the second prong of the challenge, which is to the B vires of the proviso to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961, which excludes from the exempted category, a Sikkimese woman who marries a non-Sikkimese after 1st April, 2008, it was contended by learned senior counsel and learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioners that the proviso is violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India. In this regard, it was further contended that a woman, on the mere factum C of being married would not lose her identity as a ‘Sikkimese.’ That gender-based discrimination is ex-facie evident in the proviso, more so, because there is no provision for disqualification of a Sikkimese man from claiming exemption under the Act, on marrying a non-Sikkimese woman after 1st April, 2008. D 32. It was submitted that the said proviso could not be traced to any consideration other than that of gender alone and therefore, the same ought to be declared as discriminatory against women. Reliance was placed on Anuj Garg and Ors. vs. Hotel Association of India and Ors., (2008) 3 SCC 1and G. Sekar vs. Geetha, (2009) 6 SCC 99 E to contend that exclusion from the benefits of a provision, on the ground of gender alone, would be liable to be struck down as being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 33. With the aforesaid averments, it was prayed that the definition of the term ‘Sikkimese’ as provided for in the Explanation to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961, should be read to include Indians who F had settled there as on 26th April, 1975 and that the proviso to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 which excludes from the exempted category, a Sikkimese woman who marries a non-Sikkimese after 1st April, 2008, should be struck down as being unconstitutional. Submissions of the Respondents: G 34.
