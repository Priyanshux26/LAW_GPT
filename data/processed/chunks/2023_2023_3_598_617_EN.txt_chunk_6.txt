In the aforesaid context, it was sought to be urged that the G observations of a two-Judges’ Bench of this Court in Union of India & Ors. v. Major General Shri Kant Sharma & Anr.10, was against the well-settled principle of law and established judicial precedent since that 8 Jurisdiction, powers and authority in matters of appeal against court-martial 9 (1990) 4 SCC 594 H 10 (2015) 6 SCC 773 UNION OF INDIA & ORS. v. PARASHOTAM DASS 607 [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] sought to create a complete bar to the High Court’s power to A review decisions arising from the Armed Forces Tribunal under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Such a complete bar is contrary to the Constitution Bench decision of the Supreme Court in L. Chandra Kumar11 and S.N. Mukherjee12. What was significant, it was urged, that the decision in Major General Shri Kant Sharma & Anr.13 failed B to consider that an aggrieved person in a service matter, if restrained from approaching the High Court, would be left with no legal recourse to approach any appellate authority, including the Supreme Court, since service matters are private in nature and do not involve “point of law of general public importance” under Section 31 of the said Act read with Article 136(2) of the Constitution. C 14. The view, thus, was stated to be in direct conflict with the observations of the seven-Judges’ Bench in L. Chandra Kumar14 in para 79, which reads as under:- “79. We also hold that the power vested in the High Courts to D exercise judicial superintendence over the decisions of all courts and tribunals within their respective jurisdictions is also part of the basic structure of the Constitution. This is because a situation where the High Courts are divested of all other judicial functions apart from that of constitutional interpretation, is equally to be avoided.” E 15. Lastly, it was submitted that the issues are no more res integra in view of the recent Constitution Bench of five-Judges’ Bench of this Court in Rojer Mathew v. South Indian Bank Ltd. & Ors.15 where in paragraph 215, following L. Chandra Kumar16, this Court settled that the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 does not limit the power F of the High Court, expressly or by implication, against military or armed forces dispute and that the restriction under Article 227(4) is only qua administrative supervision by the High Courts and not qua judicial review. Para 215 reads as under: G 11 (supra) 12 (supra) 13 (supra) 14 (supra) 15 (2020) 6 SCC 1 16 (supra) H 608 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A “215. It is hence clear post L. Chandra Kumar that writ jurisdiction under Article 226 does not limit the powers of High Courts expressly or by implication against military or armed forces disputes. The limited ouster made by Article 227(4) only operates qua administrative supervision by the High Court and not judicial review. Article 136(2) prohibits direct appeals before the Supreme B Court from an of armed forces tribunals, but would not prohibit an appeal to the Supreme Court against the judicial review exercised by the High Court under Article 226.” The pleas of Union of India and JAG Branch of the armed forces C 16.
