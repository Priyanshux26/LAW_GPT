6. Besides the two mortgages supra, the respondent borrowed the remaining Rs.8,50,000/- (Rupees Eight Lakhs Fifty Thousand) in four promissory notes on different dates. Since there was default in payment of interest, the appellant demanded repayment of the amount due under the four promissory notes. The respondent thereupon, in various panchayats, promised to repay the amounts. Ultimately, in the panchayat dated 24.06.2000, the respondent produced title document of his property as security towards debt under the four promissory notes, which has been noted in the Agreement dated 24.06.2000 (hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement”). This Agreement, in essence, is the root of the instant lis. 7. The Agreement notes that the respondent owed a total amount of Rs.11,00,000/- (Rupees Eleven Lakhs) to the appellant and in settlement thereof, the respondent handed over the title deeds pertaining to the property situated at No.33, Avvai Thirunagar, Chennai-600111, admeasuring 1300 square feet of land together with 4 Hereinafter abbreviated to “p.a.”. 1006 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 700 square feet building (hereinafter referred to as the “schedule property”), which was valued at Rs.9,00,000/- (Rupees Nine Lakhs). Per the Agreement, the respondent agreed to register the Sale Deed as and when demanded. Further, for re-paying the balance sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs), it was agreed that the respondent will redeem the mortgaged property from the appellant and re-mortgage it elsewhere. 8. After the Agreement was entered into between the parties, the promissory notes were returned which were torn-out in the panchayat. Thereafter, the respondent neither executed a Sale Deed nor paid the balance sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs). As a result, the appellant-plaintiff, filed the suit before the High Court, praying for: “(I) granting a usual preliminary mortgage decree of the Schedule mentioned property against the defendant for the recovery of Rs.23,96,000/- together with interest at 36% p.a. on Rs.11,00,000/- till the date of realization; And pass a final decree thereafter for sale of the Mortgaged property; (II) for costs of this suit; and for such other equitable reliefs as may deem fit and proper in the circumstances of the case and render justice.” (sic) 9. The Single Judge, after perusing the evidence on record and hearing the parties, passed dated 01.04.2010 holding that the respondent-defendant had agreed to “create equitable mortgage by depositing the title deeds”. Finding thus, the Single Judge decreed the suit. Aggrieved, the respondent filed an intra-court appeal being OSA No.189 of 2011 along with Miscellaneous Petition5 No.1 of 2011, which was an application seeking condonation of delay of 176 days. The appellant through his advocate, Mr. V. Manohar received notice and filed a counter-affidavit opposing the said condonation of delay application.
