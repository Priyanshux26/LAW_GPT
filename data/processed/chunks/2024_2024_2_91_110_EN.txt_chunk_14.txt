This section provides that the interest would be at the rate fixed under Section 27A from the date after expiry of the said period of three months till the payment of such drawback. If we look at Section 27A, the interest rate prescribed thereunder at the relevant point of time was not below ten percent and not exceeding thirty percent per annum. 37. The Central Board of Excise and Customs vide its notification bearing No.32/1995 (NT) – Customs dated 26.5.1995 had fixed the rate of interest at fifteen percent for the purpose of Section 27A of the Customs Act. The High Court while awarding interest at the rate of fifteen percent per annum, however, did not refer to such notification; rather, there was no discussion at all as to why the rate of interest on the delayed refund should be fifteen percent. Therefore, at the first glance, the rate of interest awarded by the High Court appeared to be on the higher side and without any reason. 110 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 38. Be that as it may, having regard to our discussions made above, we have no hesitation in holding that the respondent was entitled to refund of duty drawback. Appellants had belatedly accepted the said claim and made the refund. Since there was belated refund of the duty drawback to the respondent, it was entitled to interest at the rate which was fixed by the Central Government at the relevant point of time being fifteen percent. 39. That being the position, we find no good reason to interfere with the and of the Division Bench of the High Court dated 22.8.2008. There is no merit in the appeal, which is accordingly dismissed. No costs. Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey Result of the case: Appeal dismissed.
