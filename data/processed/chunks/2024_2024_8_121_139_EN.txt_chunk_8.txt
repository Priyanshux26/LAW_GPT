19. Accordingly, to begin with, the bare provision of Section 139 of the NI Act 1881 is reproduced herein below: “139. Presumption in favour of holder—It shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in section138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability.” [2024] 8 S.C.R. 133 Sri Dattatraya v. Sharanappa The aforesaid presumption entails an obligation on the court conducting the trial for an offence under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881 to presume that the cheque in question was issued by the drawer or accused for the discharge of a particular liability. The use of expression “shall presume” ameliorates the conundrum pertaining to the right of the accused to present evidence for the purpose of rebutting the said presumption. Furthermore, the effect of such presumption is that, upon filing of the complaint along with relevant documents, thereby prima facie establishing the case against the drawer, the onus of proof shifts on the drawer or accused to adduce cogent material and evidence for rebutting the said presumption, and as established in Laxmi Dyechem v. State of Gujarat and Others,5 based on preponderance of probabilities. 20. While describing the offence envisaged under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881 as a regulatory offence for largely being in the nature of a civil wrong with its impact confined to private parties within commercial transactions, the 3-Judge Bench in the decision of Rangappa (supra) highlighted Section 139 of the NI Act 1881 to be an example of a reverse onus clause. This is done so, as the Court expounds, in the light of Parliament’s intent, which can be culled out from the peculiar placing of act of dishonour of cheque in a statute having criminal overtones. The underlying object of such deliberate placement is to inject and enhance credibility of negotiable instruments. Additionally, the reverse onus clause serves as an indispensable “device to prevent undue delay in the course of litigation”. While acknowledging the test of proportionality and having laid the interpretation of Section 139 of the NI Act 1881 hereof, it was further held that an accused cannot be obligated to rebut the said presumption through an unduly high standard of proof. This is in light of the observations laid down by a co-ordinate Bench in Hiten P. Dalal v. Bratindranath Banerjee,6 whereby it was clarified that the rebuttal ought not to be undertaken conclusively by an accused, which is reiterated as follows: “23. In other words, provided the facts required to form the basis of a presumption of law exist, no discretion is left with the court but to draw the statutory conclusion, 5 [2012] 11 SCR 466 : (2012) 13 SCC 375. 6 [2001] 3 SCR 900 : (2001) 6 SCC 16. 134 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports but this does not preclude the person against whom the presumption is drawn from rebutting it and proving the contrary.
