Conventional approach may require so. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the second appeal is on a question of law. A preliminary issue was framed which was opined in favour of the respondent, and this we have now reversed. The first appellate court B found in favour of the appellant so far as the bona fide requirement is concerned. We, thus, see no real question of law arising in the present case which would be determined in the second appeal were we to remit the matter back, particularly as the real question relating to the interpretation of the law has been discussed by us. We also believe that C so much time having passed, it would be a mockery of justice to make the parties to go through another round in the second appeal. Thus, we are of the view that a quietus should be put to this prolonged dispute spanning 38 years, on something as simple as tenancy issue and as to when the proceedings commenced. We are also armed with the extraordinary power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to do D absolute justice inter se the parties. 22. We are thus of the view that the decree of eviction passed by the first appellate court dated 18.3.2004 should be affirmed and the respondent be asked to hand over vacant and physical possession of the tenanted premises on or before 30.09.2023, and to call upon the respondent E to file an undertaking in to avail of the benefit for further occupation till 30.9.2023 within two weeks. 23. The appeal is accordingly allowed leaving the parties to bear their own costs. F Divya Pandey Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Roopanshi Virang, LCRA) G H
