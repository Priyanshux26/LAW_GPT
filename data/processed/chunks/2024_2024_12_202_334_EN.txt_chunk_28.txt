Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran made the following submissions: (i) The scheme of the Act, 1962 clearly indicates that Sections 17, 46, 47 and 28 of the Act, 1962 respectively are interlinked to and inter-dependent on each other. These provisions involve a sequential flow of events to be processed by a single officer, and therefore, empowering DRI officers who are not connected to this scheme, is illegal. (ii) Section 17 deals with assessment and reassessment. Section 46 obligates filing of bills of entries. Section 47 allows clearance of goods for home consumption post the assessment under Section 17 and Section 28 pertains to demand of duty in the nature of short levy, short paid and erroneously refunded. Since all these statutory action points are interrelated, it is the same proper officer who should be empowered to perform all of these four functions and the same cannot be assigned to different sets of officers. (iii) The amendment to Section 17 in 2011 allowing self-assessment is inconsequential since the power to assess and reassess and allow clearances is still with the officer of customs. (iv) On the issue of whether there are any statutory limitations to the assignment of powers under Section 28 only to those officers who do assessment or re-assessment under Section 17, he submitted that the scheme of the Act, 1962 as explained in Sayed Ali (supra) and Mangali Impex (supra), clearly indicates that Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 respectively are interconnected and interdependent. (v) Canon India (supra) is correct in holding that DRI officers should be entrusted with the functions under Section 6 of the Act, 1962. Since the Central Government has not done so, they cannot be assigned the functions of proper officer. (vi) Section 5 of the Act, 1962 deals only with powers and duties but not the functions, whereas, Section 6 deals with functions and thus, a notification under Section 6 is necessary. He emphasised on the different consequences arising from the use of the words “powers” and “duties” in Section 5 and use of the word “functions” in Section 6. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 247 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. (vii) It was contended that Section 28 deals with short levy, non-levy and erroneous refund. Levy means determination of duty through a process of assessment/reassessment. Section 28 therefore involves rendering a finding that the earlier assessment was not correct. Section 28 is intended to revise or upset the original assessment done under Section 17 and once an gets passed under Section 28, the original assessment would not survive and therefore, the same officer can issue the show cause notice. (viii) The Board’s Circular dated 15.02.1999 cannot come to the rescue of the Department because there was no assignment of function of assessment/reassessment as required by Sayed Ali (supra). According to the learned counsel, both Notification No. 44/2011 dated 06.07.2011 and Section 28(11) were brought to the notice of this Court in Canon India (supra). (ix) Having accepted the principles laid down in Sayed Ali (supra) on the interlinkage between Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 respectively, both vide Section 28(11) and Notification No.
