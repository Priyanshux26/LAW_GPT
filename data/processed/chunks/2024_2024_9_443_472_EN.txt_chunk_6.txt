3,05,31,095/- (Rupees Three Crore Five Lakh Thirty One Thousand and Ninety Five). However, the High Court recorded on 20.06.2022 that the said amount had not been deposited in terms of its dated 23.05.2022. 11. During the pendency of the acquisition proceedings, JAL entered into an agreement with the Appellant herein for the transfer of the cement project in question. In this regard, a Scheme of Arrangement was signed between the Appellant, JAL and Jaypee Cement Corporation Ltd. (the unit of JAL operating the cement project) (the “Scheme”) under the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. The Scheme was approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) Mumbai Bench on 15.02.2017 and NCLT Allahabad Bench on 02.03.2017. 12. On 21.06.2017, the Director of Industries, Department of Industries, Government of Himachal Pradesh issued a letter to JAL and the Appellant acknowledging the approval given by the Joint Secretary to the Government of Himachal Pradesh as regards the transfer of the cement plant, as per the Scheme approved by the NCLT and as per the Tripartite Agreement between the Appellant, JAL and Government of Himachal Pradesh respectively, entered into on 29.06.2017. 452 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 13. In such circumstances, the High Court examined the relationship between the Appellant and JAL and also referred to the Scheme for the purpose of determining the issue as to who should pay the compensation amount determined under the Supplementary Award to the Respondent Nos. 1-6 respectively. 14. On 12.07.2022, the High Court relying on Clause 7.1 of the Scheme, passed the impugned , directing the Appellant to pay the compensation amount at the first instance and left it open for the Appellant to recover the same from JAL later, if permissible in law. 15. In view of the aforesaid, the Appellant is before this Court with the present appeal. II. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 16. Mr. Navin Pahwa, the learned senior counsel appearing for the Appellant made the following submissions: a. The High Court, in its impugned , erred in directing the Appellant to pay the compensation amount determined under the Supplementary Award because the initial Award dated 08.06.2018 as well as the Supplementary Award dated 02.05.2022 were passed by the LAC fixing the liability to pay compensation on JAL. b. The High Court failed to consider that under the Scheme between the Appellant and JAL, as sanctioned by NCLT, Mumbai on 15.02.2017 and NCLT, Allahabad on 02.03.2017, all contingent liabilities pertaining to matters relating to the “JAL Business” (as defined in Clause 1.1(w) of the Scheme), including those of pending litigations where the disputed claims were not crystallized on or before the effective date, i.e., 29.06.2017, would be the sole liability of JAL. Since the acquisition proceedings for the subject land were initiated by a notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act dated 25.07.2008, therefore, the litigation was pending as on 29.06.2017 (the “Effective Date”) and the disputed claim was not crystallized till the passing of the Supplementary Award dated 02.05.2022. c. The High Court erred in recording that the Appellant had made the payment under the Award dated 08.06.2018, whereas factually, it was JAL who had paid the compensation amount [2024] 9 S.C.R.
