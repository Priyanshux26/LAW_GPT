The land of the appellants, situated in village Khora, Pargana Loni, Tehsil Dadri, District Ghaziabad, was part and parcel of the total land measuring 902.2046 acres which was proposed to be acquired by a notifi cation dated 17.03.1988 published on 19.03.1988 under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (in short, “the Act”).

The appellants, however, did not fi le any appeal before the High Court within a reasonable time. They eventually preferred the fi rst appeals in the year 2011. Their appeals were barred by limitation; hence, they applied for condonation of delay of 12 years and 353 days. The grounds taken by the appellants for condonation of delay were that due to illiteracy and poverty, they could not arrange the Court Fee and that they were advised to fi le the appeal(s) in September, 2011. They also put forward the plea that the fi rst appeals against the same reference award were pending consideration before the High Court. 6. The High Court has vide impugned dated 09.03.2016 declined to condone the delay and consequently, the fi rst appeal(s) preferred by the appellants have been dismissed. 7. Meanwhile, the batch of fi rst appeals preferred by other land owners, came to be decided on 04.07.2016, wherein the High Court enhanced the compensation at the rate of Rs.130 per sq. yard. The operative part of the dated 04.07.2016 reads as follows: “19.
