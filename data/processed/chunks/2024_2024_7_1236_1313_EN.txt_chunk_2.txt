1239 Mohd. Abdul Samad v. The State of Telangana & Anr. in nature and is always subject to final determination of the rights of the parties by appropriate courts – Further emphasis has also been placed on the expression “unable to maintain herself” and that the burden of proof is on the wife to prove the existence of said circumstances leading to such inability – This is, in addition, to the requirement to establish that the husband has “sufficient means” to maintain her, and is, however, neglecting or refusing to do so. [Paras 12, 13] [Per Augustine George Masih, J.] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.125 – Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 – s.3 – Comparative dissection: Held: Under Section 3 of the 1986 Act, the entitlements or rights of a divorced Muslim woman, wider than the ambit of maintenance, arise as against the obligations of her former husband emanating from their divorce – Per contra, under Section 125 of CrPC 1973, a woman seeking maintenance has to establish that she is unable to maintain herself – The right to seek maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC 1973 is invokable even during the sustenance of marriage and, thereby is not contingent upon divorce – Another distinction is related to the time period – While a petition moved under Section 3(2) of the 1986 Act is to be decided in regard to a husband’s liability under Section 3(1) of the 1986 Act within a period of one month, there is no such statutory time frame prescribed under Section 125 of CrPC 1973 – However, there is an obligation to determine the interim maintenance within a period of 60 days while dealing with a petition under Section 125 of CrPC 1973 – Moreover, failure to comply with such passed under Section 3(2) of the 1986 Act may lead to issuance of a warrant for levying the amount of maintenance as directed under the said and may also sentence him to imprisonment till the payment is made or for a term which may extend to one year – On the other hand, equivalent non-compliance of an passed under Section 125 of CrPC 1973 may result in imprisonment for a term of one month or until the payment is made. [Paras 22, 23] [Per Augustine George Masih, J.] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.127(3)(b) and s.125: Held: The most appropriate construction of these secular provisions of CrPC 1973 in regard to the right of maintenance is that the legislature would never intend that an undue benefit is derived after 1240 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the end of the marital relationship between the parties concerned – Hence, the provision of Section 127(3)(b) of CrPC 1973 would act in the nature of a proviso to the right provided under Section 125 of CrPC 1973 only in such a circumstance where sufficient means of livelihood after the divorce, and the provisions contemplating the future needs of divorced Muslim women, stands provided to the satisfaction of the court concerned.
