The respondent ADA raised an objection that the complaint was barred by limitation, claiming that the complaint was filed on 10.07.2020, well beyond the statutory limitation period prescribed under Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which mandates that a complaint must be filed within two years from the date on which the cause of action arises. ADA argued that the offer of possession made on 04.02.2014 should have triggered the limitation period. However, the NCDRC, in its impugned , rightly rejected this argument by considering that the respondent ADA issued reminders to the appellant on 22.09.2014, 21.11.2014, and 17.01.2018. Additionally, ADA accepted the appellant’s payment of Rs. 3,43,178/- on 20.06.2019 8 [2004] 3 SCR 68 : (2004) 5 SCC 65 9 Civil Appeal No.3053 of 2023 10 [1993] Suppl. 3 SCR 615 : (1994) 1 SCC 243 11 [2019] 10 SCR 375 : (2020) 16 SCC 226 12 (2022) 6 SCALE 16 106 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports without any reservations. Given these facts, the NCDRC correctly applied Sections 18 and 19 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which extend the limitation period where part payments or acknowledgments are made. Consequently, the cause of action continued to exist, and the filing of the complaint in July 2020 is within the limitation period. 17. This Court concurs with the NCDRC’s reasoning and affirms that the complaint was not barred by limitation. The ongoing interactions between the parties, including ADA’s acceptance of part payment in 2019 and the reminders sent, effectively extended the limitation period under established legal principles. However, while the complaint is within limitation, we also recognize that the appellant delayed making the balance payment of Rs. 3,43,178/- for over five years, from 2014 to 2019. This delay was largely due to the appellant’s requests for a waiver of interest, which, while understandable, contributed significantly to the delay in finalizing the transaction. 18. In light of these circumstances, while the appellant is entitled to a refund along with interest, it would be inequitable to award interest from the date of the original payment in 2011 given the appellant’s role in the delay. 19. The respondent ADA has also challenged the pecuniary jurisdiction of the NCDRC, contending that the total payment made by the appellant amounted to Rs. 59,97,178/-, which was less than Rs. 1 crore. As such, ADA argued that the complaint should have been filed before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and not the NCDRC, which has jurisdiction over matters exceeding Rs. 1 crore as per Section 21(a)(i) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. This Court finds no merit in ADA’s argument. The NCDRC, in its impugned , correctly observed that the claim made by the appellant was not limited to the deposit amount alone but also included compensation for mental agony, harassment, and loss of income, which brought the total claim well above Rs. 1 crore. In consumer disputes, the value of the claim is determined not just by the amount deposited but by the aggregate relief sought, which includes compensation and other claims.
