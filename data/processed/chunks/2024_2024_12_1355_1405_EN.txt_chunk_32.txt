She has health issues and she incures costs for her medical treatment and physiotheraphy, in her affidavit of assets and liabilities (Exh.10) at Enclosure-1 D she has mentioned that the columns of medical details are not applicable to her. It means that she doesn’t suffer from any elements. She has also not adduced any evidence about her elements, treatments and costs incurred by her for her treatment.
