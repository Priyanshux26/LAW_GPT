He contended that the single and division benches of the High Court erred in concluding that Section 537 of the Act is the only provision for acquisition. Relying on State of Kerala v. T.M. Peter4, he would submit that for differential schemes and purposes of acquisition, different compensation structures will not violate Article 14 of the Constitution. On the same point, he also relied on the decisions of this Court in Girnar Traders (3) v. State of Maharashtra5, and Bankatlal v. Special Land Acquisition Officer6. 13. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi and Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior counsels, appearing for the respondents, while supporting the of the High Court, impugned herein, submitted that the power of acquisition is only in Section 537 of the Act and that invocation of Section 352 read with Section 363 is illegal and violative of Article 300A of the Constitution. In support of their submissions, they relied on the of this Court in Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vithal Rao7. 14. Scheme of the Act: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation Act, 1980 extends to 636 Sections, followed by 9 Schedules. It has IX Parts, of which we are concerned only with Part VI of which Chapter XXI – relating to Streets and Public Places and Part VIII of which Chapter XXXIII – relating to Acquisition and Disposal of Property. As the appellant-Corporation invoked Section 352 of the Act to acquire the Property for the purpose of opening a park and ward office, we need to examine the provision. Section 352 of the Act provides as under: “Section 352:- Power to acquire lands and buildings for public streets and for public parking places:– The Municipal Commissioner may, subject to the other provisions of this Act – 4 [1980] 3 SCR 290 : (1980) 3 SCC 554 5 [2011] 3 SCR 1 : (2011) 3 SCC 1 6 [2014] 7 SCR 879 : (2014) 15 SCC 116 7 [1973] 3 SCR 39 : (1973) 1 SCC 500 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 843 Kolkata Municipal Corporation & Anr. v. Bimal Kumar Shah & Ors. (a) acquire any land required for the purpose of opening, widening, extending or otherwise improving any public street, square, park or garden or of making a new one, together with any building standing upon such land; (b) acquire, in relation to any land or building as aforesaid, such land with building thereon outside the regular line or the projected regular line of such public street; (c) acquire any land for the purpose of laying out or making a public parking place.” 15. The appellant-Corporation has also relied on Section 363 of the Act relating to payment of compensation. The said provision is as under: “Section 363-Compensation to be paid:– (1) Compensation shall be paid by the Corporation to the owner of any building or land acquired for a public street, square, park or garden under the provisions of this Chapter: Provided that any increase or decrease in the value of the remainder of the property, of which building or the land so acquired formed part, likely to accrue from the setting back to the regular line of a public street, shall be taken into consideration in determining the amount of such compensation.
