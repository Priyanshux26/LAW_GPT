(we shall refer to it henceforth as “Design Tech”). The original object, in terms of a memorandum numbered as G.O.Ms. No. 4 dated 30.06.2015 issued by the Skill Development, Entrepreneurship & Innovation (Skills) Department approving the said Agreement, was to set up six different clusters comprising of one Centre of Excellence and five Technical Skill Development Institutions and Skill Development Centres in Andhra Pradesh. The total project cost was conceived to be Rs.3281,05,13,448/- with each of the six clusters costing Rs.546,84,18,908/-. Government contribution was limited to 10 percent of the cost amounting to Rs.55,00,00,000/- , with SIEMENS and Design Tech providing grant-in-aid of 90% 556 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports i.e., Rs.491,84,18,908/-. It is the State’s case that requirement of contribution of the two corporate entities was ignored and the final memorandum of agreement only entailed outflow of Rs.330/- crores from the State to Design Tech. A signed copy of this memorandum, which does not carry any date, has been made Annexure R-15 to the counter-affidavit of the State (Volume IV at page 206). 4. Submission on the part of the State is that in course of an investigation by the Additional Director General, GST Intelligence at Pune, while examining claims of availing CENVAT credit by Design Tech and one Skillar Enterprises India Pvt. Ltd. (“Skillar”), a financial scam was unearthed involving both SIEMENS and Design Tech. This was in relation to funds pertaining to the project of setting up skill development centres. The complaint of the taxing body was that SIEMENS and Design Tech had subcontracted substantial part of their work to Skillar despite there being no provision of any sub-contract in the Agreement. Design Tech had claimed that Skillar provided training software development including various sub-modules designed for high end software for advance manufacturing of CAD/CAM.
