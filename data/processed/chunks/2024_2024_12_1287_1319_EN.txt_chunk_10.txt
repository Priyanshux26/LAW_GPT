No. 98276 of 2021 referred to supra came to be filed for modification of the said dated 21.11.2014 primarily on the ground of financial hardship amongst other grounds, which came to be rejected. 3 [2021] 1 SCR 389 : (2021) 15 SCC 338 1302 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 5.5 It is apt and appropriate to note at this juncture itself that a specific plea came to be raised by the State in paragraph 9 of the aforesaid application, that if the TDR certificate is issued as per the dated 21.11.2014 to the extent of 15 acres 39 guntas the notional value of the same would be Rs.1,396 crores. At the cost of burdening this the relevant plea raised by the respondent in that regard is extracted herein below: “9. The Respondents/Applicant-State of Karnataka respectfully submits that area of land sought to be acquired vide I.A. No. 13/2011 is an extent of 15 acres 39 guntas. If the compensation was required to be paid in terms of the Award passed under the Act of 1996 for the extent of 15 acres 39 guntas, the compensation payable would be Rs.37,28,813. However, if the TDR certificate is to be issued for the said extent of 15 acres 39 guntas, it would result in 13,91,742 Sq. ft. additional built up area constructible in the city of Bengaluru and approximately it would be equivalent to notional value of Rs.1,396 crores. It is also relevant to note that TDR once granted is transferable. If the appellants were to be given TDR, the same may immediately be transferred by the appellants to any other parties/ builders. In event of the final going against the appellants, then it would not be possible to recover the value of TDR from the appellants.” (Emphasis Supplied by us) 6. On passing of the aforesaid dated 17.05.2022 it was incumbent upon the respondents-authorities to implement the aforesaid two s without a demur as they are crystal clear. However, same was conveniently ignored or in other words the authorities seem to have gone into deep sleep at least till 05.04.2017 on which date a notification came to be issued by BBMP for carrying out the work of widening the road. 7. One another factor which cannot go unnoticed in the background of affidavits filed by both the parties is, that in respect of the subject property, Writ Petitions in Public Interest had also been filed seeking [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1303 Chaduranga Kanthraj Urs and Anr. v. P. Ravi Kumar and Ors. widening of Bellary Road and Jayamahal Road before the High Court of Karnataka wherein several s came to be passed by referring to the s passed by this Court referred to supra, of which contempt is alleged. Hence, we deem it proper to refer to the dated 07.09.2016 passed in W.P. No. 42927 of 2015 which would have direct bearing on the present proceedings and it reads: “We, therefore, direct the State Government to grant necessary clearance to the BBMP for widening the road and issue TDR certificates to the land owners in terms of the of the Supreme Court of India as per the existing TDR rules.
