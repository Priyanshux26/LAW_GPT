[See also Nelson Fernandes vs. Land Acquisition Officer (2007) 9 SCC 447 ]. 70. The VIDC has relied upon certain circulars to show the consequence of blue zone. Since the finding is that no construction area is limited to 15 meters from the boundary, the circulars do not carry the case of the State any further. In any event, the State Government’s affidavit has clearly stated that what was in vogue in the relevant time was the Standardized Building Byelaws and Development Control Rules for B and C Class Municipal Councils of Maharashtra which was made applicable to even areas outside Municipal limits by Government resolution of 02.04.1974. The State does not in its affidavit make any reference to any applicable circular. 71. The appellant had averred that out of the total extent of 125937.8 sq. ft., he had claimed @ Rs, 500/- per sq. ft. for 84481 sq. ft. which constitutes 68.3% (approx.) of the total extent. The balance area of 41404 sq. ft. which constituted approximately 32%, according to him were the area covered by roads and open space. He had claimed Rs.25 lakhs for the extent of making the roads and also prayed for damages at Rs. 50 lakhs. 72. In view of our , the appellant will be entitled to Rs.100/- per sq. ft. for the 68.3% (approx.) of the balance area, after excluding the land area, if any, which falls within the 15 meters from the defined boundary of the water course. For the land falling within the no construction zone, if any, as per the Standardized Building Byelaws, he will be paid at the rate determined by the Special Land Acquisition Officer in the award. Insofar as the market value of the land in question and other statutory benefits are concerned, the of the Reference Court will continue to operate, subject to one modification.

In another Appeal decided by us in this batch today, we have held the appellant entitled to rental compensation at the rate of 8% of the awarded amount for the period from 15.11.1998 to 04.08.2000, the date of the award. In view of the same, direction no. 5 in the operative of the Reference Court requires to be modified. That direction was under Section 28 of the 2278 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Act. In view of the entitlement for the rental income till 04.08.2000, the appellant shall be entitled to interest on the enhanced amount at 9% for a period of one year from 04.08.2000 and at the rate of 15% for the period thereafter till payment of amount in the court. If the amount is already deposited, nothing further needs to be done. If not, the State may pay the deficit, if any. 73.
