not be regarded as a substitute for a sentence of transportation for life.” (emphasis supplied) Further, in para 23, the in Shri Bhagwan [(2001) 6 SCC 296 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 1095] observed as follows: (SCC pp. 306-07) “23. In Maru Ram v. Union of India [(1981) 1 SCC 107 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 112] a Constitution Bench of this Court reiterated the aforesaid position and observed that the inevitable conclusion is that since in Section 433-A we deal only with life sentences, remissions lead nowhere and cannot entitle a prisoner to release. Further, in Laxman Naskar v. State of W.B. [(2000) 7 SCC 626 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 1431] , after referring to the decision of Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra [AIR 1961 SC 600 : (1961) 3 SCR 440], the Court reiterated that sentence for ‘imprisonment for life’ ordinarily means imprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted person›s natural life; that a convict undergoing such sentence may earn remissions of his part of sentence under the Prison Rules but such remissions in the absence of an of an appropriate Government remitting the entire balance of his sentence under this section does not entitle the convict to be released automatically before the full life term if served. It was observed that though under the relevant Rules a sentence for imprisonment for life is equated with the defi nite period of 20 years, there is no indefeasible right of such prisoner to be unconditionally released on the expiry of such particular term, including remissions and that is only for the purpose of working out the remissions that the said sentence is equated with defi nite period and not for any other purpose.” (emphasis supplied) 91. The legal position as enunciated in Pandit Kishori Lal [(1944-45) 72 IA 1 : AIR 1945 PC 64], Gopal Vinayak Godse [AIR 1961 SC 600 : (1961) 3 SCR 440], Maru Ram [(1981) 1 SCC 107 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 112], Ratan Singh [(1976) 3 SCC 470 : 1976 SCC (Cri) 428] and Shri Bhagwan [(2001) 6 SCC 296 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 1095] and the 806 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. unsound way in which remission is actually allowed in cases of life imprisonment make out a very strong case to make a special category for the very few cases where the death penalty might be substituted by the punishment of imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term in excess of fourteen years and to put that category beyond the application of remission. 92. The matter may be looked at from a slightly diff erent angle. The issue of sentencing has two aspects. A sentence may be excessive and unduly harsh or it may be highly disproportionately inadequate. When an appellant comes to this Court carrying a death sentence awarded by the trial court and confi rmed by the High Court, this Court may fi nd, as in the present appeal, that the case just falls short of the rarest of the rare category and may feel somewhat reluctant in endorsing the death sentence.
