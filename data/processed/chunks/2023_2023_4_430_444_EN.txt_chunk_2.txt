The present batch of Civil Appeals, mostly by the Revenue and few of the assessees arises out of s and s passed by the various High Courts, more particularly the High Court of Karnataka, B dismissing the appeals challenging the findings of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (for short, ‘Tribunal’) on ‘Transfer Pricing’ issues on the ground that the issues decided by the Tribunal are questions of fact and as perversity is neither pleaded nor argued nor demonstrated by placing material to that effect, no substantial question of law arises for C consideration under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short, ‘IT Act’).
