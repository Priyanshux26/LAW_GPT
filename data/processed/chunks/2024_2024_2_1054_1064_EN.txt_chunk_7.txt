The impugned would reveal that even after acquitting the appellant for the offences under Sections 342 & 365, IPC, the High Court confirmed his conviction under Section 306, IPC, holding that the appellant had failed to offer explanation as to how the deceased Senthil Kumar entered into the tailoring Shop of PW-3 to commit suicide in terms of Section 106 of the Evidence Act. 18. We are at a loss to understand as to how Section 106 of the Evidence Act could be applied in the case on hand against the appellant in view with facts narrated above. This Section is an exception to the 1064 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports general rule laid down in Section 101 which casts burden of proving a fact on the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue. Section 106 is not intended to relieve any person of that duty or burden. On the contrary, it says that when a fact to be proved, either affirmatively or negatively, is especially within the knowledge of a person, it is for him to prove it. This Section, in its application to criminal cases, applies where the defence of the accused depends on his proving a fact especially within his knowledge and of nobody else. In short, Section 106 cannot be used to shift the burden of proving the offence from the prosecution to the accused. It can only when the prosecution led evidence, which, if believed, will sustain a conviction or which makes out a prima facie case, that the question of shifting the onus to prove such fact(s) on the accused would arise. (See the decision in Sawal Das v. State of Bihar5). 19. In view of the exposition of law as above and in the absence of anything to make Section 106 applicable to shift the onus on the appellant, the High Court had committed an error in applying Section 106 of the Evidence Act, in the instant case. 20. We have no hesitation, therefore, to hold that there is absolute absence of any basis for its application against the appellant in view of the evidence on record. 21. The upshot of the discussion is that the prosecution has miserably failed to establish that the appellant herein had abetted the victim to commit suicide. The conviction of the appellant under Section 306, IPC cannot be sustained. 22. Resultantly this appeal stands allowed. The appellants conviction under Section 306, IPC which was confirmed vide dated 25.01.2019 passed by the High Court in Criminal Appeal No.667/2011 is quashed and set aside. Consequently, he stands acquitted of the offence under Section 306, IPC. The appellant is already on bail. His bail bonds are discharged. 23. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
