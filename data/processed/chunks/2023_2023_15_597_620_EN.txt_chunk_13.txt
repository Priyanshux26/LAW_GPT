B.S. Chauhan, J. noted the position in law in the following terms : (SCC p. 172, para 59) “59. The law laid down above has consistently been followed and it is a settled proposition of law that an authority cannot issue s/office memorandum/executive instructions in contravention of the statutory rules. However, instructions can be issued only to supplement the statutory rules but not to supplant it. Such instructions should be subservient to the statutory provisions. (Vide Union of India v. Majji Jangamayya [Union of India v. Majji Jangamayya, (1977) 1 SCC 606 : 1977 SCC (L&S) 191] , P.D. Aggarwal v. State of U.P. [P.D. Aggarwal v. State of U.P., (1987) 3 SCC 622 : 1987 SCC (L&S) 310] , Paluru Ramkrishnaiah v. Union of India [Paluru Ramkrishnaiah v. Union of India, (1989) 2 SCC 541 : 1989 SCC (L&S) 375] , C. Rangaswamaiah v. Karnataka Lokayukta [C. Rangaswamaiah v. Karnataka Lokayukta, (1998) 6 SCC 66 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1448] and Joint Action Committee of Air Line Pilots’ Assn. of India v. DG of Civil Aviation [Joint Action Committee of Air Line Pilots’ Assn. of India v. DG of Civil Aviation, (2011) 5 SCC 435] . )” (emphasis supplied) 17. In P.D. Aggarwal v. State of U.P. [P.D. Aggarwal v. State of U.P., (1987) 3 SCC 622 : 1987 SCC (L&S) 310] a two-Judge Bench of this Court declined to grant primacy to an offi ce memorandum issued by the Government of Uttar Pradesh which purportedly amended the method of recruitment of Assistant Civil Engineers in the U.P. Public Service Commission without amending the relevant regulations. The Court held : (SCC p. 640, para 20) “20. The offi ce memorandum dated 7-12-1961 which purports to amend the United Provinces Service of Engineers (Buildings and Roads Branch) Class II Rules, 1936 in our opinion cannot 616 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. override, amend or supersede statutory rules. This memorandum is nothing but an administrative or instruction and as such it cannot amend or supersede the statutory rules by adding something therein as has been observed by this Court inSant Ram Sharma v. State of Rajasthan [Sant Ram Sharma v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1967 SC 1910 : (1968) 1 SCR 111] . Moreover the benefi ts that have been conferred on the temporary Assistant Engineers who have become members of the service after being selected by the Public Service Commission in accordance with the service rules are entitled to have their seniority reckoned in accordance with the provisions of Rule 23 as it was then, from the date of their becoming member of the service, and this cannot be taken away by giving retrospective eff ect to the Rules of 1969 and 1971 as it is arbitrary, irrational and not reasonable.” (emphasis supplied)” 34. It can thus be seen that it is a trite law that the Government cannot amend or supersede statutory rules by administrative instructions, but if the rules are silent on any particular point, it can fi ll up the gaps and supplement the rules and issue instructions not inconsistent with the rules already framed.
