v. Sami Ullah (Dead) Through Lrs. & Anr. below have proceeded to allot 1/2 share to Zahoor Ahemed on the basis that it was a joint property of the family. The said approach, in my considered opinion, is not legally tenable. The lease in question was acted upon and was accepted as is evident from the extract of khatauni (record of rights) of the third settlement, Annexure-2 to writ petition No. 18 of 1975. The Deputy Director of Consolidation was not justified in importing principles of Hindu law while determining the shares of the parties. In a nut shell, the petitioners of writ petition No. 6635 of 1974 will get 1/12 share in the land comprised in the said lease deed and not 1/2 as was wrongly held by consolidation authorities. In view of the above discussions, it is held that the petitioners of writ petition No. 6635 of 1974 have 1/12 share jointly in the plots comprised in khata Nos. 98 and 99 excluding plot Nos. 35, 37, 111 and 112 which exclusively belongs to Sami Ullah and his brother Badlu, sons of Abdul Ghafoor. 24. We do not find any error or infirmity in the view taken by the High Court. The decision rendered by the High Court is on a bundle of facts agitated and counter agitated by both the parties. It is a factual determination by the High Court based on the evidence on record. We do not find any perversity in the approach of the High Court or any error apparent on the face of record to warrant further scrutiny by this Court. 25. That being the position, we are of the view that there is no merit in the two civil appeals which are accordingly dismissed. However, there shall be no as to costs. 26. In view of the passed in C.A. Nos. 9739-9740/2011, the Contempt Petition stands closed. Result of the case: Civil Appeals dismissed. Contempt Petition closed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
