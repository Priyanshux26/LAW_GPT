[Para 34][858-G-H; 859-A-B] Testimony of the Eye Witness 5. Much reliance has been placed on the evidence of P.W.12. There is no difficulty in appreciating the submission that an injured witness has to be placed on a higher pedestal. However, F P.W.12 has not been examined by P.W.20 at all. In his deposition, P.W.12 repeatedly makes this position clear. The statement of P.W.12 under Section 161 CrPC, if recorded, has also not been marked. Even P.W.20 at one stage acknowledges the said fact, though with some contradictions. This again brings to the G conclusion that it would be unsafe to rely upon the evidence of P.W.12, who once again identifies the accused for the first time before the Court. There is absolutely no explanation for not examining him during the investigation. Thus, the evidence of P.W.12 cannot be relied upon, particularly in the light of the H 844 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A charges under Section 149 IPC, and insofar as the appellants are concerned. [Para 37][864-B-E] State of Madhya Pradesh v. Ratan Singh and Others, (2020) 12 SCC 630; Arvind Kumar @ Nemichand v.
