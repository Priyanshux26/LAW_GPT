This Court in Nawab Shaqafath Ali Khan v Nawab Imdad Jah Bahadur, (2009) 5 SCC 162, held: G “48. If the High Court had the jurisdiction to entertain either an appeal or a revision application or a writ petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, in a given case it, subject to fulfilment of other conditions, could even convert a revision application or a writ petition into an appeal H 446 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A or vice versa in exercise of its inherent power. Indisputably, however, for the said purpose, an appropriate case for exercise of such jurisdiction must be made out.” (emphasis supplied) 49. In respectful agreement with the above statement of law, we B reiterate that High Courts, under Articles 226 and/or 227, are to exercise their discretion “… solely by the dictates of judicial conscience enriched by judicial experience and practical wisdom of the judge.”, as highlighted in Surya Dev Rai v Ram Chander Rai, (2003) 6 SCC 675. This guiding principle still governs the field, and the 3-Judge Bench C in Radhey Shyam v Chhabi Nath, (2015) 5 SCC 423 had only partly overruled Surya Dev Rai (supra) in terms below: “29.1. Judicial s of the civil court are not amenable to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. 29.2. Jurisdiction under Article 227 is distinct from jurisdiction D under Article 226. 29.3. Contrary view in Surya Dev Rai [Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai, (2003) 6 SCC 675] is overruled.” 50. Article 226 of the Constitution is a succour to remedy injustice, and any limit on exercise of such power, is only self-imposed. Gainful E reference can be made to, amongst others, A V Venkateswaran v Ramchand Sobhraj Wadhwani, (1962) 1 SCR 573 and U P State Sugar Corporation Ltd. v Kamal Swaroop Tandon, (2008) 2 SCC 41. The High Courts, under the Constitutional scheme, are endowed with the ability to issue prerogative writs to safeguard rights of citizens. For F exactly this reason, this Court has never laid down any strait-jacket principles that can be said to have “cribbed, cabined and confined” [to borrow the term employed by the Hon. Bhagwati, J. (as he then was) in E P Royappa v State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 1974 SC 555] the extraordinary powers vested under Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution. Adjudged on the anvil of Nawab Shaqafath Ali Khan (supra), this was G a fit case for the High Court to have examined the matter threadbare, more so, when it did not involve navigating a factual minefield. 51. For reasons aforenoted, this criminal appeal succeeds and stands allowed. Consequently, (a) the Impugned Judgement is quashed and set aside, and; (b) the conviction and sentence awarded by the GSFC H B. S. HARI COMMANDANT v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 447 [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] dated 10.04.1996 is also set aside. The appellant is held entitled to full A retiral benefits from the date of his superannuation till date.
