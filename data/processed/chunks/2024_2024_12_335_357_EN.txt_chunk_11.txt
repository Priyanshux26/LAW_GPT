Naturally, the State [2024] 12 S.C.R. 351 Ashok v. State of Uttar Pradesh concerned must pay a reasonable sum that the court may fix when assigning counsel to the prisoner. Of course, the court may judge the situation and consider from all angles whether it is necessary for the ends of justice to make available legal aid in the particular case. In every country where free legal services are given it is not done in all cases but only where public justice suffers otherwise. That discretion resides in the court.” (emphasis added) This issue was again dealt with by a Bench of three Judges in the case of Anokhilal v. State of M.P..5 In this decision, this Court revisited the law on this aspect. In paragraph 11, this Court relied upon the decision in the case of Hussainara Khatoon (IV).3 In paragraph 20, this Court summarised the principles laid down from time to time. Paragraph 20 reads thus: “20. The following principles, therefore, emerge from the decisions referred to hereinabove: 20.1. Article 39-A inserted by the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution, effected in the year 1977, provides for free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities. The statutory regime put in place including the enactment of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 is designed to achieve the mandate of Article 39-A. 20.2. It has been well accepted that right to free legal services is an essential ingredient of “reasonable, fair and just” procedure for a person accused of an offence and it must be held implicit in the right guaranteed by Article 21. The extract from the decision of this Court in Best Bakery case [Zahira Habibulla H. Sheikh v. State of Gujarat (2004) 4 SCC 158 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 999] (as quoted in the decision in Mohd. Hussain [Mohd. Hussain v. State (NCT of Delhi) (2012) 9 SCC 408 : (2012) 3 SCC (Cri) 1139] ) emphasises that the object of criminal trial is to search for the truth and 5 [2019] 18 SCR 1196 : (2019) 20 SCC 196 352 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the trial is not a bout over technicalities and must be conducted in such manner as will protect the innocent and punish the guilty. 20.3. Even before insertion of Article 39-A in the Constitution, the decision of this Court in Bashira [Bashira v. State of U.P. (1969) 1 SCR 32 : AIR 1968 SC 1313 : 1968 Cri LJ 1495] put the matter beyond any doubt and held that the time granted to the Amicus Curiae in that matter to prepare for the defence was completely insufficient and that the award of sentence of death resulted in deprivation of the life of the accused and was in breach of the procedure established by law. 20.4. The portion quoted in Bashira [Bashira v. State of U.P. (1969) 1 SCR 32 : AIR 1968 SC 1313 : 1968 Cri LJ 1495] from the of the Andhra Pradesh High Court authored [Alla Nageswara Rao, In re, 1954 SCC OnLine AP 115 : AIR 1957 AP 505] by Subba Rao, J., the then Chief Justice of the High Court, stated with clarity that mere formal compliance of the rule under which sufficient time had to be given to the counsel to prepare for the defence would not carry out the object underlying the rule.
