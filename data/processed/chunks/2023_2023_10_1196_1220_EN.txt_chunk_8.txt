Consequently, the proceeding against discharged person is H 1206 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A dropped. On the other hand, under Section 319 Cr.P.C., a person who has not been named as an accused is summoned to be tried along with other accused while section 227 Cr.P.C. results in conclusion of proceedings against a person who is an accused on his discharge. On the other hand, a person who is not an accused is summoned to be tried along with other accused under Section 319 Cr.P.C. B 21. A reading of the said Section would clearly indicate that power is given to the Court to proceed against any other person appearing to be guilty of an offence. The expression ‘proceed’ as appearing in Section 319 Cr.P.C. is of significance. The exercise of power under Section 319 Cr.P.C. is not at the initial stage where cognizance is taken of the offence C and the summoning is passed before committal of the matter to the Sessions Court. That power exercised under Section 190 of the Cr.P.C. is quite distinct from the power exercised by the Trial Court/Sessions Court under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. In our view, much significance turns on the expression ‘proceed’ in Section 319 Cr.P.C. The said Section D came up for consideration before this Court in innumerable cases.However, it is of relevance to mention Constitution Bench s in Hardeep Singh; Sukhpal Singh Khair vs. State of Punjab, (2023) 1 SCC 289, (“Sukhpal Singh Khair”) and in Brijendra Singh &Ors. v/s. State of Rajasthan (2017) 7 SCC 706, (“Brijendra Singh”). 22. The relevant paragraphs in Hardeep Singh can be crystallised E as under: – (i) The Constitution Bench of this Court was concerned with three aspects: firstly, the stage at which powers under Section 319 Cr.P.C. can be invoked; secondly, the materials on the basis whereof the invoking of powers under Section 319 Cr.P.C. can be justified; and thirdly, the F manner in which powers under Section 319 Cr.P.C. have to be exercised. While answering the five questions referred to the Constitution Bench in paragraph 117, it was concluded as under: “117. We accordingly sum up our conclusions as follows: Questions (i) and (iii) G — What is the stage at which power under Section 319 CrPC can be exercised? AND — Whether the word “evidence” used in Section 319(1) CrPC H has been used in a comprehensive sense and includes the YASHODHAN SINGH & ORS. v. THE STATE OF UTTAR 1207 PRADESH & ANR. evidence collected during investigation or the word “evidence” A is limited to the evidence recorded during trial? Answer 117.1. In Dharam Pal case [Dharam Pal v. State of Haryana, (2014) 3 SCC 306 : AIR 2013 SC 3018] , the Constitution Bench has already held that after committal, cognizance of an B offence can be taken against a person not named as an accused but against whom materials are available from the papers filed by the police after completion of the investigation. Such cognizance can be taken under Section 193 CrPC and the Sessions Judge need not wait till “evidence” under Section 319 CrPC becomes C available for summoning an additional accused.
