[Paras 13, 24-40] 342 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Electricity Act, 1910 – s.24 – Discontinuance of supply to consumer neglecting to pay charge – Limitation period: Held: Although s.24 prescribes no period of limitation, it does allow the licensee to discontinue supply of energy upon a consumer neglecting to pay charges that are demanded by raising a bill, irrespective of the fact that a suit for recovery of unpaid charges would be barred if not instituted within three years of the liability accruing – There appears to be no limitation as regards the period within which notice u/s.24(1) has to be issued, evincing the intention of the licensee to disconnect supply for non-payment of claimed dues – However, if in case, despite the consumer not paying the charges demanded and the notice thereunder is not issued within a reasonable period or at any time within which a suit for recovery could be instituted, whether the right of the licensee to claim the unpaid charges would lapse will have to be decided by the court before whom the lis is brought upon consideration of the defence that is raised and the explanation for the delay – It must depend on the facts of each particular case whether the demand by reason of mere delay should be interdicted or not – Furthermore, s.17 of the 1963 Act is meant to save suits from being dismissed as time-barred, which could not be filed due to bona fide mistakes or errors – If a suitor alleges that the suit could not be instituted by him within the prescribed period of limitation because of some mistake, which came to be discovered beyond the period prescribed for institution of a suit, it is open to such suitor to claim exemption from limitation in terms of Ord. VII r. 6 CPC and such exemption can be granted in an appropriate case – However, if a suitor alleges to have discovered a mistake later but it is proved on evidence being led that exercise of reasonable diligence could have resulted in the mistake being discovered on an earlier date, limitation would begin to count from that earlier date; and, in case, the count from the said earlier date takes the date of institution of the suit beyond the prescribed period of limitation, the bar of limitation would get attracted – Mistake is, thus, not a circumstance which can be used as a shield to save negligence in all cases – Absence of due diligence or lack of bona fides would not clothe suitor to take undue advantage of beneficent provision like s.17 – Limitation Act, 1963 – s.17 – Electricity Act, 2003 – s.56(2).
