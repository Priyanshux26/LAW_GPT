The English courts have adopted an approach which favors a strict adherence to the doctrine of privity. Under English law, an arbitration agreement is extended to non-signatory parties on the basis of traditional contractual principles and doctrines such as agency, novation, 25 Saudi Butec Ltd et Al Fouzan Trading v. Saudi Arabian Saipem Ltd, unpublished ICC Interim Award of 25 October 1994, confi rmed by DFT on 29 January 1996, ASA Bulletin (1996) Vol 3 p 496. 26 Decision 4A_376/2008 of 5 December 2008. 27 X v. Y Engineering S.p.A. and Y S.p.A., 4A_450/2013, ASA Bull., 160 (2015). 662 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. assignment, operation of law, and merger and succession.28 However, the English law has explicitly rejected other doctrines such as piercing the corporate veil, equitable estoppel, and group of companies as a basis for extending an arbitration agreement to non-signatory parties. 50. In Peterson Farms INC v. C & M Farming Limited,29 a claim for damages was brought against Peterson Farms by the respondent C & M Farming for damages suff ered by several C & M group entities, some of them being non-signatories to the arbitration agreement. The arbitral tribunal applied the group of companies doctrine to hold that C & M Farming contracted on behalf of the entire C & M group entities, and therefore was entitled to claim all the damages suff ered by the C & M group entities arising out of the contractual relationship with Peterson. In appeal, the Commercial Court held that the chosen proper law of the Agreement - Arkansas law – is similar to the English law which excludes the application of the group of companies doctrine. Thus, the English law does not favor the application of the group of companies doctrine for extending an arbitration agreement to non-signatory parties. 51. The English precedents have also dealt with the meaning of the phrase “claiming through or under”, which was referred to by this Court in Chloro Controls (supra). In Roussel-Uclaf v. G D Searle and Co Ltd30, the issue before the Court of Chancery Division was whether a wholly owned subsidiary company could claim to be a party to an arbitration agreement between the parent company and a third party. The Court was called upon to interpret Section 1 of the Arbitration Act of 1975 which allowed any party to an arbitration agreement “or any person claiming through or under him” to apply to a court to stay proceedings where an arbitration agreement existed. It was held that the subsidiary can claim the benefi t of the arbitration agreement because the parent company and the subsidiary were “so closely related” that it could be said that the subsidiary was “claiming through or 28 Audley William Sheppard, ‘Third Party Non-Signatories in English Arbitration Law’ in Stavros Brekoulakis, Julian Lew, et al (eds) The Evolution and Future of International Arbitration (Kluwer Law International, 2016) 183-198. 29 [2004] EWHC 121 (Comm) 30 [1978] 1 Lloyd’s Rep COX AND KINGS LTD. v.
