G 49. Therefore, the appeals challenging the impugned of the High Court dated 31.10.2022 insofar as they are traceable to Criminal O.P. No.15122 of 2021 are concerned, deserve to be allowed. Accordingly, these appeals are allowed and the dated 31.10.2022 H 1066 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A passed in Criminal O.P.No.15122 of 2021 is set aside. Criminal O.P.No.15122 of 2021 shall stand dismissed. Part-II (Concerning proceedings by Enforcement Directorate) 50. As we have narrated in the sequence of events, ED registered B an Information Report on 29.07.2021, only after filing of a Final Report under Section 173(8) of the Code., in CC No.24 of 2021, including the offences punishable under the PC Act. This Final Report was in FIR No.441 of 2015, which was originally registered as CC No.3627 of 2017 (it became CC No.24 of 2021). The Final Report filed under Section 173(8) of the Code on 08.03.2021, named Shri V. Senthil Balaji (Minister) C as Accused No.1 and the offences charged against the accused were under Sections 406, 419, 420 read with Section 34 and 120B, 465, 467, 471 and 201 IPC read with Sections 7, 12, 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act and Section 109 of IPC. Since the offences under Sections 120B, 419, 420, 467 and 471 of IPC and Sections 7 and D 13 of the PC Act are included in The Schedule to the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 200211, the registration of the Information Report by ED on 29.07.2021 cannot be faulted. 51. After registration of the Information Report, the ED started issuing summons to the accused. ED also filed petitions before the Special Court (in seisin of the predicate offences) seeking copies of documents. E These petitions were partly allowed by the Trial Court by an dated 09.11.2021. As against the portion of the of the Trial Court disentitling ED to certified copies of the unmarked documents, ED filed petitions under Section 482 of the Code before the High Court. The petitions were partly allowed by the High Court by an dated F 30.03.2022 permitting the ED to follow the procedure of conducting inspection under Rule 237 of Rules, 2019 and thereafter by filing a fresh third-party copy application before the Special Court. 52. Thereafter, ED sent fresh summons to the Minister and others in April, 2022. Immediately, the Minister and two others filed three G separate writ petitions seeking the quashing of the summons issued by ED. 53. In the writ petition filed by the Minister in W.P. No.18213 of 2022 for quashing the summons issued by the ED, he contended inter- alia: - H 11 For short “PMLA” Y. BALAJI v. KARTHIK DESARI & ANR. ETC. 1067 [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] (i) that he was falsely implicated in FIR Nos.441 of 2015, 15 of A 2016, 298 of 2017 and 344 of 2018; (ii) that FIR No.15 of 2016 had already been quashed; (iii) that FIR Nos.441 of 2015 and 298 of 2017 were stayed by the High Court; B (iv) that FIR No.344 of 2018 was quashed by the High Court; (v) that in view of the above, the mandatory requirements of Section 2(1)(y) and Section 3 of the PMLA, are not attracted; (vi) that the registration of ECIR was based upon those complaints; C (vii) that since those complaints are the subject matter of scrutiny in the quash petitions, there is nothing for ED to proceed; (viii) that Section 63 of the PMLA prescribes a punishment for false information or failure to give information and hence the summons issued under Section 50 will force him to give statements incriminating D himself in the cases for the predicate offences, thereby infringing upon his rights under Article 20(3) of the Constitution; (ix) that ED had not identified any proceeds of crime with the accused, so as to enable them to proceed with the investigation; (x) that before the Trial Court and the High Court, ED wanted E copies of documents available with the State Police, on the ground that without the copies of such documents, it was not possible for ED to proceed; (xi) that the initiation of investigation by the ED is vitiated by malafide; F (xii) that without any material being available with the ED either about the proceeds of crime or about the act of money-laundering on the part of the accused, ED cannot proceed; and (xiii) that without having any incriminating material against the accused about money-laundering, ED cannot proceed further.
