The pleadings as reflected from reading of the plaint are as follows: (a) Parties had entered into an agreement to sell dated 24.05.1981. The defendants 1 to 5 were to transfer the property in dispute in favour of the plaintiffs for total sale consideration of Rs.29,000/-, out of which Rs.12,000/- was paid as advance and a further amount of Rs.2000/- was paid on 22.07.1981, thus, totalling the advance amount to Rs.14,000/-. The transaction was to be completed within three months from the time when the Government would remove the restriction for registration of the sale deed of lands similar to the property in dispute and that the expenses were to be borne by the plaintiffs. (b) In paragraph-4, it was stated that the plaintiffs were always ready and willing to perform their part of obligation and that they are ready even now to perform their part, however, it was the defendants 1 to 5 who had been dragging their feet and had been taking time for performing the remaining part of the agreement. They also became elusive and non-committal. The reason for the same was that the price of the property had 1354 [2024] 7 S.C.R.

The plaintiffs also tendered the money and the draft sale deed requesting the defendants to execute the sale deed but they denied the execution as period of three months had expired.
