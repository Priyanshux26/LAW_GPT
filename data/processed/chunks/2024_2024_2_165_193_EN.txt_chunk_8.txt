To consider whether the Appellant No. 1 is entitled to the protection of the Temporary Extension Act, 2023, it is necessary to recapitulate the facts of the present case. The Appellant No. 1 obtained his Caste Certificate on 03.02.2013. Only on 30.12.2020 (the date of his nomination) he submitted an application for the Validity Certificate to the Caste Scrutiny Committee. At the time of filing of his nomination, he also filed an undertaking that he will produce the Caste Validity Certificate within twelve months from the date of his election. On 18.01.2021, the elections were held and on 21.01.2021, the results were declared and the Appellant No. 1 was declared elected. The twelve months period expired on 20.01.2022. 16. On 30.12.2020, when he filed the application online to the Scrutiny Committee for obtaining the Validity Certificate, a receipt was issued to him. In the receipt, the following endorsement appears:- “I have been informed that, within seven days will file declaration otherwise the matter should be closed.” Thereafter, it is undisputed that on 01-03/04/2021, the District Caste Certificate Verification Committee, Satara made the following .

Digital Supreme Court Reports candidates the committee scrutinized that, whether these applicants are elected in such elections or not?
