This, according to the learned Judge, was contrary to Section 22 of the Act of 1950. He accordingly held that acceptance of Jagdishchandra as the Vahiwatdar under Change Report No. 899 of 2015 could not be sustained and, in consequence, his Change Report No. 1177 of 2017 could also not be sustained. It is on this sole ground that the learned Judge restored the proceedings in relation to both the Change Reports to the file and directed the Deputy Charity Commissioner, Solapur, to decide them afresh. The learned Judge further directed that the position existing as on that date should be maintained, i.e., Jagdischandra and his nominated Trustees, who were administering the Trust, were permitted to continue to administer the Trust in accordance with law. 19. Before we proceed to consider the matter on merits, we may again note the fact that the Act of 1950 was amended in 2017, whereby a proviso was added in Section 22(1), providing for condonation of delay in the filing of a Change Report, if sufficient cause is shown therefor. It may be noted that no such proviso was in existence at the time Change Report No. 899 of 2015 was submitted by Jagdishchandra. Despite the same, he had filed a delay condonation application therewith praying for condonation of the delay on his part in filing the report. It is well settled that it is not mandatory that a written application be filed seeking condonation of delay and relief can be granted in that regard even upon an oral request, provided sufficient cause is shown for such delay [See Bhagmal and others vs. Kunwar Lal and others1 and Sesh Nath Singh and another vs. Baidyabati Sheoraphuli Co-operative Bank Ltd. and another2]. 1 [2010] 8 SCR 1104 : (2010) 12 SCC 159 2 [2021] 3 S.C.R. 806 : (2021) 7 SCC 313 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 71 Shri Mallikarjun Devasthan, Shelgi v. Subhash Mallikarjun Birajdar & Ors. 20. The proviso added in Section 22(1) in the year 2017 is merely clarificatory in nature as is evident from the fact that it was ‘added’ in Section 22(1) and it did not bring about any substantive change. Even in the absence thereof, the wording of Section 22(1) of the Act of 1950, as it stood earlier, did not negate the applicability of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963, and in consequence, Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, could be invoked for condonation of the delay in the submission of a Change Report. Significantly, the High Court did not call for the original file to verify whether the Deputy Charity Commissioner, Solapur, had passed a separate on the delay condonation application, condoning the delay in exercise of such power. In any event, the Joint Charity Commissioner, Pune, proceeded on the understanding that the delay had already been condoned. He passed an to that effect on 29.01.2019 and that was never challenged by the applicants in Revision Application No.61 of 2017, viz., the Birajdar family. Once that attained finality, it is not open to them to ignore the same and reopen the issue of delay before the High Court.
