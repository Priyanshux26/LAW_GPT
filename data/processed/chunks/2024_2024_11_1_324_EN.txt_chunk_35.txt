34 Ibid [1537] (Khanna J). 35 Ibid [1518] (Khanna J). 48 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Mukherjea, P Jaganmohan Reddy, and HR Khanna found that the latter half of Article 31-C violated the basic structure and was therefore invalid.36 Thus, the final outcome of the decision in Kesavananda Bharati as concerns Article 31-C was that (i) the first half of Article 31-C granting immunity to laws enacted in furtherance of clauses (b) or (c) of Article 39 against challenges based on Articles 14,19 and 31 was valid; and (ii) the second half of Article 31-C excluding judicial review over whether a law in truth furthers the principles set out in clauses (b) or (c) of Article 39 was struck down. As Justice HR Khanna succinctly recorded in his conclusions: “1537. … (xiii) The first part of Article 31-C introduced by the Constitution (Twenty-fifth) Amendment Act is valid. The said part is as under: “31-C. Notwithstanding anything contained in Article 13, no law giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles specified in clause (a) or clause (c) of Article 39 shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article 14, Article 19 or Article 31: Provided that where such law is made by the legislature of a State, the provisions of this article shall not apply there to unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration of the President, has received this assent.” (xiv) The second part of Article 31-C contains the seed of national disintegration and is invalid on the following two grounds: (1) It gives a carte blanche to the legislature to make any law violative of Articles 14, 19 and 31 and make it immune from attack by inserting the requisite declaration. Article 31-C taken along with its second part gives in effect the power to the legislature including a State Legislature, to amend the Constitution in important respects. 36 Ibid [417]-[429] (Sikri CJ); [599]-[605] (Shelat and Grover JJ); [726]-[735] (Hedge and Mukhrejea); [1203]-1210] (Reddy J); [1530]-[1535-A] (Khanna J).

(2) The legislature has been made the final authority to decide as to whether the law made by it is for the objects mentioned in Article 31-C. The vice of the second part of Article 31-C lies in the fact that even if the law enacted is not for the object mentioned in Article 31-C, the declaration made by the legislature precludes a party from showing that the law is not for the object and prevents a court from going into the question as to whether the law enacted is really for that object. The exclusion by the legislature, including a State Legislature, of even that limited judicial review strikes at the basic structure of the Constitution. The second part of Article 31-C goes beyond the permissible limit of what constitutes amendment under Article 368.
