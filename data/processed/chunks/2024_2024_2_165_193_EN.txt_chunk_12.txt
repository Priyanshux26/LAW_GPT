Questions for Consideration: 26. In this scenario, the questions that arise for consideration are as follows: a. Whether Appellant No. 1 is entitled to the protection of Sections 3 and 4 of the Temporary Extension Act, 2023? b. Whether the proceedings of 19.06.2023 holding the No Confidence Motion against Appellant No. 2 as not carried for want of the requisite votes is tenable? Contentions 27. We have heard Mr. Gaurav Agrawal, learned advocate (since designated as a senior counsel) for the appellants and Mr. Vinay Navare, learned senior counsel for the Respondent nos. 1 to 8 as well as Mr. Aniruddha Joshi, learned counsel for the official respondents. Mr. Gaurav Agrawal, learned advocate vehemently contends that the application filed before the Scrutiny Committee on 30.12.2020 has not been rejected. According to the learned counsel, the dated 01-03/04.2021 cannot be construed as a rejection; that his application was pending and the filing done on 14.06.2023 was only a re-filing after curing the defects. In view of the same, according to the learned counsel, the Appellant No.1 is entitled to the benefit of the validation provision under Section 3 of the Temporary Extension 184 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Act, 2023. Learned counsel contends that under Section 35(3) of the Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, a No Confidence Motion has to be carried by a majority of not less than three-fourth of total number of Members who are for the time being entitled to sit and vote.
