This is the ratio decidendi. It is not everything said by a judge when giving a that constitutes a precedent. The only thing in a judge’s decision binding a party is the principle upon which the case is decided and for this reason it is important to analyse a decision and isolate from it the ratio decidendi.” (emphasis supplied) 114. Further, a simple test that has been invoked by this Court to determine whether a particular proposition of law is to be treated as the ratio decidendi of a case is the “inversion test” formulated by Professor 112 [2023] 12 SCR 979 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1004 : 2023 INSC 736 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 119 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. Eugene Wambaugh.113 The test mandates that to determine whether a particular proposition of law is part of the ratio decidendi of the case, the proposition is to be inversed. This means that either that proposition is hypothetically removed from the judgement or it is assumed that the proposition was decided in reverse. After such removal or reversal, if the decision of the Court on that issue before it would remain the same then the observations cannot be regarded as the ratio decidendi of the case.114 115. In Mafatlal, a Bench of nine Judges of this Court adjudicated on the rights and remedies available to a citizen against the State in relation to the refund of unlawfully recovered taxes and imposts. The court dealt with whether a manufacturer or assessee who has passed on the burden of an illegally recovered tax is entitled to a refund or whether a refund in such cases will amount to unjust enrichment. One of the several arguments made by the counsel appearing for the Union of India was that this question must be decided in light of the constitutional values of social and economic justice, including those laid down in the Preamble and Articles 39(b) and (c). More specifically, it was urged that Article 265115 must be interpreted in the context of these constitutional values. 116. Faced with the above argument, the majority opinion authored by Justice Jeevan Reddy, on behalf of himself and four other judges, made certain observations which referred to Article 39(b). These observations are found in paragraphs 84 to 86 of the judgement. We must take a closer look at these observations, in the context of the issues before the Court, to determine whether they are part of the ratio decidendi and central to the decision of this Court. 117. Justice Jeevan Reddy attempted to locate the question of refund of unlawfully recovered duty within the framework of the “philosophy and core values” which guide our Constitution. In this context, it was observed that these values can be located inter alia in the Directive Principles contained in Part IV, including Article 39(b) and the Preamble of the Constitution.
