Since the date of separation, the son has been residing with the respondent–wife. Subsequently, on 11.05.2004, the appellant–husband filed a petition under Section 13(1) (ia) of the HMA, before the Family Court seeking divorce on the ground of cruelty. During the pendency of the divorce petition, the respondent, on 27.05.2004, filed an application under Section 24 of the HMA seeking pendente lite maintenance for herself and the son. This application was disposed of by the Family Court vide dated 20.09.2004, directing the appellant to pay a cumulative sum of ₹18,000/- (Rupees eighteen thousand only) per month, comprising ₹15,000/- (Rupees fifteen thousand only) to the respondent and ₹3,000/- to the son. 4. Both parties challenged the Family Court’s through separate appeals before the High Court. Consequently, vide dated 21.11.2005, the High Court enhanced the maintenance amount to ₹20,000/- (Rupees twenty thousand only) per month, allocating ₹15,000/- (Rupees fifteen thousand only) to the respondent and ₹5,000/- (Rupees five thousand only) to the son. Subsequently, the respondent filed an application under Sections 24 and 26 of the HMA, seeking further enhancement of interim maintenance. In her application, she claimed an enhanced amount of ₹1,45,000/- (Rupees one lakh forty five thousand only) per month, contending that the appellant’s income had increased significantly, exceeding ₹4,00,000/- (Rupees four lakhs only) per month, inclusive of salary, perks, allowances, and bonuses. She further argued that the financial needs of both, her and the son, had increased manifold since the prior determination of maintenance. 5. During the pendency of the application, the appellant, in July 2015, voluntarily increased the interim maintenance to ₹65,000/- (Rupees [2024] 12 S.C.R. 547 Parvin Kumar Jain v. Anju Jain sixty five thousand only) per month. He agreed to pay ₹50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) to the respondent, effective from the date of filing the enhancement application on 28.02.2009, and ₹15,000/- (Rupees fifteen thousand only) to the son, effective from July 2015. However, the appellant contended that following the dismissal of his divorce petition on 14.07.2016 upon being withdrawn by him, the Family Court had become functus officio, rendering it incapable of granting any further relief under Sections 24 and 26 of the HMA. He also submitted that the provisions of Section 26 of the HMA do not permit granting of maintenance to an adult male child. 6. The respondent’s application for enhanced interim maintenance rested on her assertion of significant changes in circumstances since the last maintenance , including the increased financial requirements of herself and the son. On the other hand, the appellant’s position focused on the legal implications of the withdrawal of his divorce petition and the applicability of Section 26 of the HMA concerning the maintenance of an adult male child. 7. The Family Court, in its dated 16.08.2018, allowed the respondent’s application for enhancement of maintenance and held that the relief in an application filed under Section 24 of the HMA can only be granted from the date of filing of the application, i.e., 28.02.2009, until the date the main divorce petition was dismissed as withdrawn, i.e., 14.07.2016.
