2227 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company framework to regulate the composition of the arbitral tribunal and conduct of arbitral proceedings. The incorporation of Section 12(5) is a recognition of the well-established principle that quasi-judicial proceedings should be conducted consistent with the principles of natural justice. Section 18 serves as a guide for arbitral tribunals to follow the principles of equality and fairness during the conduct of arbitral proceedings. Thus, the Arbitration Act requires the arbitral tribunals to act judicially in determining disputes between parties.114 64. Since arbitral proceedings have “trappings of a court”, the law requires arbitral tribunals to act objectively and “exercise their discretion in a judicial manner, without caprice, and according to the general principles of law and rules of natural justice.”115 An arbitral award can be set aside if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure violates the mandatory provisions of the Arbitration Act, including Sections 12 and 18. Thus, the Arbitration Act emphasizes that the substance of the law cannot be divorced from the procedure. 65. Section 31 mandates that an award made by an arbitrator shall be in writing and signed by all members of the arbitral tribunal.116 The provision further provides that an arbitral award shall state the reasons upon which it is based, unless the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be given. This provision is consistent with the principle that a quasi-judicial authority must generally record its reasons in support of the it makes.117 Further, the decision rendered by an arbitral tribunal is binding and enforceable “in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court.”118 66. Arbitral tribunals serve as effective alternatives to traditional justice dispensing mechanisms. The purpose of arbitral tribunals is to be expeditious where the law is slow, cheap where the law is costly, simple where the law is technical, and a peace-maker instead of 114 Engineering Mazdoor Sabha v.

Supreme Court Reports a stirrer up of strife.119 Arbitral tribunals can inspire confidence in their adjudicatory process by conducting fair and impartial hearings and providing sufficient and cogent reasons for their decisions.120 Given the adjudicatory functions performed by arbitral tribunals, the decisions which emanate from them must be grounded in a process that is independent and impartial.
