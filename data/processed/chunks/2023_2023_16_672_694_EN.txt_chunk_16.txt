If, within its limited jurisdiction, the adjudicating authority fi nds any shortcoming in the resolution plan vis-à-vis the specifi ed parameters, it would only send the resolution plan back to the Committee of Creditors, for re-submission after satisfying the parameters delineated by the Code and exposited by this Court.’ (emphasis supplied) 32. From the assistance rendered and the judicial precedents brought to notice, it is clear that the dated 01.09.2021 by the NCLT cannot withstand judicial scrutiny, either on facts or in law. There may have been a situation where due to glaring facts, an of the nature impugned herein could be left untouched and this Court would have refrained from interference, but only if detailed reasoning, disclosing the facts for being persuaded to embark on such path, were discernible in the dated 01.09.2021, which unfortunately is cryptic and bereft of detail. Recording of reasons, and not just reasons but cogent reasons, for s is a duty on Courts and Tribunals. In the recent past, from Kranti Associates Private Limited v Masood Ahmed Khan, (2010) 9 SCC 496 to Manoj Kumar Khokhar v State of Rajasthan, (2022) 3 SCC 501, the clear position in law is that a Court or even a quasi-judicial authority has a duty to record RAMKRISHNA FORGINGS LTD v. RAVINDRA LOONKAR, 693 R. P. OF ACIL LTD.[AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] reasons for its decision. Needless to add, ‘Reason is the heartbeat of every conclusion. Without the same, it becomes lifeless.’15 That apart, the of the NCLT dated 01.09.2021 suff ers from a jurisdictional error, as in the facts that prevailed, it was not entitled to pass the direction that it did. 33. Under the circumstances, while this Court could have adopted the course of remanding the matter back to the NCLT for fresh/de novo consideration, but being conscious of the fact that such course would impede quick resolution as the CIRP is in a stalemate right from 01.09.2021 and after having applied our minds to the factual aspects also, we do not fi nd that remand for consideration afresh, now, would serve the purpose of justice or aid the objects of the Code. 34. Accordingly, and for all the reasons afore-stated, this appeal stands allowed. The dated 01.09.2021 of the NCLT and the Impugned dated 19.01.2022 of the NCLAT are set aside. The NCLT will pass appropriate s in terms of this , on the Approval Application, being I.A. No.1636 of 2019 in CP(IB) No.170(PB)/2018, within three weeks from the date of production of a copy of this . Pending avoidance application(s) on the fi le of the NCLT in connection herewith shall proceed on their own merits, but with expedition. No as to costs. 35. Insofar as the pending Interlocutory Applications herein are concerned, they are dealt with below: a. I.A. No.25463/2022: Does not survive in view of the decision in the appeal; disposed of. b. I.A. No.25464/2022: Does not survive in view of the decision in the appeal; disposed of. c. I.A. No.185233/2022: Wrongly shown as pending in the sheet; already disposed of vide dated 17.04.2023.
