82 In this context, the court took note of Goodes v East Sussex County Council (2000 [3] All ER 603) and Southwark London Borough Council v. Mills (1999 [4] All ER 449). 83 [2013] 10 SCR 259 84 [2015] 10 SCR 880 85 1996 (2) SCC 428 86 The court had cited State (Through CBI/New Delhi) v. S.J. Choudhary (1996) 2 SCC 428; SIL Import, USA v. Exim Aides Silk Exporter [1999] 2 SCR 958 and BR Enterprises v. State of U.P. [1999] 2 SCR 1111 147 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 91. Furthermore, the petitioners relied on the interpretation of this court, in Githa Hariharan v. Union of India87, wherein the court construed the word ‘after’ in Section 6(a) of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 as meaning “in the absence of - be it temporary or otherwise or total apathy of the father towards the child or even inability of the father by reason of ailment or otherwise” - thus, saving it from the vice of discrimination. Reliance was also placed on Association of Old Settlers of Sikkim & Ors. v. Union of India88 where an exemption provision89 discriminated against Sikkimese women who may have had their names registered in the Register of Sikkim subjects, married non-Sikkimese on or after 1st April, 2008, and excluded them from the benefi t. This court held such discrimination to be violative of equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In Independent Thought (supra), this court invalidated as discriminatory a provision90 which permitted sex between a man, and a young woman married to him, above the age of 15 years. The resultant classifi cation was that sex with any woman below 18 years, irrespective of consent was defi ned as rape.91 87 [1999] 1 SCR 669 88 (2023) 10 SCR 289 89 [Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961] 90 [Exception 2 to Section 375, IPC, 1860] 91 The reasoning of the court was that “a girl can legally consent to have sex only after she attains the age of 18 years. She can legally enter into marriage only after attaining the age of 18 years. When a girl gets married below the age of 18 years, the persons who contract such a marriage or abet in contracting such child marriage, commit a criminal off ence and are liable for punishment under the PCMA. In view of this position there is no rationale for fi xing the age at 15 years. This age has no nexus with the object sought to be achieved viz., maintaining the sanctity of marriage because by law such a marriage is not legal. It may be true that this marriage is voidable and not void ab initio (except in the State of Karnataka) but the fact remains that if the girl has got married before the age of 18 years, she has right to get her marriage annulled. Irrespective of the fact that the right of the girl child to get her marriage annulled, it is indisputable that a criminal off ence has been committed and other than the girl child, all other persons including her husband, and those persons who were involved in getting her married are guilty of having committed a criminal act.
