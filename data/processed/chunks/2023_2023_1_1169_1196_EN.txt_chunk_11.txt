It is noticeable from the facts that two justifications were provided by the MSFC to deny the benefit of pay revisions, in terms of the Fifth Pay Commission recommendations. One, that it is “in to motivate the present staff to recover maximum amount in NPA D Accounts…” and two, that the fixation of cut-off date falls within the state’s policy making domain, involving among others - an important consideration, which is the state’s financial concerns, which the court should not interfere in. 27. That on whether, and what should be the extent of pay revision, E are undoubtedly matters falling within the domain of executive policy making. At the same time, a larger public interest is involved, impelling revision of pay of public officials and employees. Sound public policy considerations appear to have weighed with the Union and state governments, and other public employers, which have carried out pay revision exercises, periodically (usually once a decade, for the past 50 F years or so). The rationale for such periodic pay revisions is to ensure that the salaries and emoluments that public employees enjoy, should keep pace with the increased cost of living and the general inflationary trends, and ensure it does not adversely impact employees.
