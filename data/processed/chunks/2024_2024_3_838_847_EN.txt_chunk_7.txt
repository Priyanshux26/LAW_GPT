Had that been the case, there was no occasion for him not to take or lay a claim to a 50% share in the rent given by the tenants, which is clear from the finding recorded by the High Court that there were tenants also in the Kamla Nagar property; but the respondents never claimed any share in such proceeds/ rent from the tenants. The issue was agitated for the very first time only by filing the suit before the Trial Court in 1983. 22. Thus, on an overall circumspection of the facts and circumstances and upon going through the records and submissions with the aid of learned counsel appearing for the respective parties, the Impugned inasmuch as it relates to the Kamla Nagar property viz.

It is further held that the appellants are the exclusive owners of the Kamla Nagar property described hereinbefore. The Impugned insofar as it relates to RFA No.483 of 2008 is upheld. Accordingly, Civil Appeal No.1591 of 2020 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 847 Jugal Kishore Khanna (D) Thr. Lrs. & Anr. v. Sudhir Khanna & Ors. is allowed and Civil Appeal No.1592 of 2020 is dismissed.
