A and ability are approximately equal (See B.V. Sivaiah and Ors. (supra); Rajendra Kumar Srivastava and Ors. Vs. Samyut Kshetriya Gramin Bank and Ors., (2010) 1 SCC 335). 8.9 It is required to be noted that in the present case and as per the merit list produced before the High Court, the candidates, who have B secured much more marks are denied promotion and the candidates / Civil Judge (Senior Division), who are having less marks / leas meritorious are promoted. In the present case, the petitioner No. 1 secured 135.50 out of 200 marks and the petitioner No. 2 secured 148.50 marks out of 200 against which a candidate having secured 101 marks have got the promotion, which is affecting the principle of “merit-cum-seniority”. C 9. Thus, we are more than satisfied that the impugned Select List dated 10.03.2023 issued by the High Court and the subsequent Notification dated 18.04.2023 issued by the State Government granting promotion to the cadre of District Judge are illegal and contrary to the relevant Rules and Regulations and even to the decision of this Court in the case of All D India Judges’ Association and Ors. (supra). Therefore, we are more than prima facie satisfied that the same as such are not sustainable. Though, we were inclined to dispose of the writ petition finally, however, as Shri Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of some of the respondents – promotees has prayed not to dispose of the E writ petition finally and, therefore, may consider the question of interim relief, we are not disposing of the writ petition finally. Taking into consideration the fact that the State Government has issued the impugned Notification dated 18.04.2023 during the pendency of the present writ petition and after the receipt of the notice issued by this Court in the present proceedings and, thus, despite in knowledge of the present F proceedings, however, subject to the ultimate outcome of the present writ petition and as observed hereinabove, the State Government could have waited till the next date of hearing by this Court, which was on 28.04.2023 and at present the respective promotees have not assumed their posting on the promotional post and as such are sent for training, G we stay the further implementation and operation of the Select List dated 10.03.2023 issued by the High Court of Gujarat and the subsequent Notification dated 18.04.2023 issued by the State Government. Meaning thereby, the respective promotees be sent to their original posts which they were holding prior to their promotion vide Select List dated 10.03.2023 and Notification dated 18.04.2023. However, it is clarified H RAVIKUMAR DHANSUKHLAL MAHETA & ANR. v. HIGH 433 COURT OF GUJARAT AND ORS. [M. R. SHAH, J.] that the present stay shall be confined with respect to those A promotees whose names do not figure within the first 68 candidates in the Merit List on the basis of the merits, the copy of which is produced by the High Court along with the counter.
