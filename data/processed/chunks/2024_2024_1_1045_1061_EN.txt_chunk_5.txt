In other words, the lenders had agreed that if SRA satisfies particular criteria, including infusing Rs. 350 Crores by 31 August 2023, adhering to the resolution plan terms, and meeting employee payment obligations in accordance with the NCLAT dated 21 October 2022, they would abstain from challenging exclusion/extension of time issues. However, the inability to meet these conditions necessitates directing the Corporate Debtor into liquidation, as stipulated in Paragraphs 8(a) to (c). Paragraph 8 is reproduced below: “8. In the present appeal, the lenders are agreeable that in case; a) SRA infuses Rs. 350 Crores by 31.08.2023, the date by which said payment is to be made as per the Resolution Plan, read with dated 26.05.2023 passed by this Hon’ble Tribunal; and b) SRA Undertakes to scrupulously follow the other terms and conditions of the resolution plan and c) SRA complies with the liabilities relating to payment to the employees as per of NCLAT dated 21.10.2022 which has been upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its dated 30.01.2023, the Lenders would not contest the issues relating to granting of exclusion/extension of time (in terms of the s dt. 13.01.2023 passed by NCLT and dt. 1054 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 26.05.2023 passed by this Hon’ble Tribunal) as well as on the issue relating to compliance of condition precedent by the SRA and accordingly undertakes to withdraw the present Company Appeal (AT) Ins 129-130 of 2023 which is pending adjudication before this Hon’ble Tribunal along with Civil Appeal Nos. 4131-34 of 2023 & 3736-37 of 2023 filed before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, on the said two issues. In other words, lenders would not contest the granting of exclusions as well as on the issue regarding the compliance of Conditions Precedent, in case the aforesaid steps are taken by SRA without any further delay. Failing to comply with the conditions mentioned in Para 8(a) to (c) above, the Corporate Debtor should be directed to go into liquidation.” 11. Following the affidavit, which was filed by SBI, an application was moved by the SRA on 18 August 2023 seeking liberty to pay the amount of Rs 350 crores as envisaged in the affidavit of SBI in the following manner: (i) The first tranche of Rs 100 crores by 31 August 2023; (ii) The second tranche of Rs 100 crores by 30 September 2023; and (iii) The balance of Rs 150 crores by the adjustment of the Performance Bank Guarantee7 issued by the SRA in favour of the lenders. 12. Permission to do so was granted by the NCLAT on 28 August 2023 extending time until 31 August 2023 for the payment of Rs 100 crores; till 30 September 2023 for the payment of Rs 100 crores and for the balance of Rs 150 crores by adjusting the payment against the PBG issued by the SRA. 13. The reference to the PBG was contained in the tabulated statement in clause 6.4.4 of the Resolution Plan, which is set out above. Apart from the above stipulations, it would be material to make a reference, at this stage, to certain provisions of the Request for Resolution Plans8.
