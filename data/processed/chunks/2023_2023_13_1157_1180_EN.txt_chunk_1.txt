[Para 16-18] Evidence – Circumstantial Evidence – Reliance upon: Held: One has to be circumspect and cautious while undertaking the exercise of linking the evidence available – Courts should not lose sight of the fact that such evidence should unerringly lead and point out the accused alone, of course, on the facts of each case. [Para 22] Evidence – Double Presumption – Presumption of innocence: Held: When the view of the trial court, which had the benefi t of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses, is both a possible and plausible one, it shall not be replaced by yet another one – Presumption of innocence in favour of the accused gets strengthened by the decision of the trial court when he gets an of acquittal. [Para 23] Witnesses – Material witnesses – Non-examination of: Held: Non-examination of a witness, though material, by itself would not vitiate the trial – However, when facts are so glaring and with the witnesses available, particularly when they are likely to give a diff erent story, the Court shall take adequate note of it – When HARVINDER SINGH @ BACHHU v. 1159 THE STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH a circumstance has been brought to the notice of the Court by the defense and the Court is convinced that a prosecution witness has been deliberately withheld, as it in all probability would destroy its version, it has to take adverse notice – Anything contrary would be an aff ront to the concept of fair play. [Para 24] Evidence – Eff ect of absconding: Held: Subsequent conduct would be a relevant fact u/s. 8 of the Evidence Act - However, such a fact has to be proved – Mere absconding by itself cannot constitute a sole factor to convict a person because an accused may abscond as he might fear an illegal arrest.
