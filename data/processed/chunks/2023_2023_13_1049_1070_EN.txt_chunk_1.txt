[Paras 15, 16] Interpretation of Statutes – Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Paragraph 1 of the Schedule – Penal Code, 1860 – s.120B: PAVANA DIBBUR v. THE DIRECTORATE OF 1051 ENFORCEMENT Held: The penal statutes are required to be strictly construed – The penal laws must be construed according to the legislative intent as expressed in the enactment – While giving eff ect to the legislature’s intention, if two reasonable interpretations can be given to a particular provision of a penal statute, the Court should generally adopt the interpretation that avoids the imposition of penal consequences – A more lenient interpretation of the two needs to be adopted – The legislative intent which can be gathered from the defi nition of the scheduled off ence under clause (y) of sub Section (1) of s.2 of the PMLA is that every crime which may generate proceeds of crime need not be a scheduled off ence – Therefore, only certain specifi c off ences have been included in the Schedule – Thus, if the submission of the ED that as s.120B, IPC is included in Part A to the Schedule even if the allegation is of making a criminal conspiracy to commit an off ence which is not a part of the Schedule, the off ence becomes a scheduled off ence, is accepted, the Schedule will become meaningless or redundant – Reason explained – Interpretation suggested by the ED will defeat the legislative object of making only a few selected off ences as scheduled off ences – If such an interpretation is accepted, the statute may attract the vice of unconstitutionality for being manifestly arbitrary – It cannot be the legislature’s intention to make every off ence not included in the Schedule a scheduled off ence by applying s.120B – Therefore, the off ence u/s.120-B included in Part A of the Schedule will become a scheduled off ence only if the criminal conspiracy is to commit any off ence already included in Parts A, B or C of the Schedule.
