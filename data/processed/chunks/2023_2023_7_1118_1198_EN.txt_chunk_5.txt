3. Before embarking upon the requisite details, a few preliminary C comments and brief outline shall be apposite. 3.1. The matters in issue essentially relate to the internal management of a political party, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam1, which is registered with the Election Commission of India. This political party, said to be having the primary cadre consisting of D more than 1.5 crore members, has its own byelaws, which have been amended from time to time. The two upper levels of party structure include the Central Executive Committee2 and the General Council of the Central Organization3. Though, in the scheme of byelaws, the topmost position in the party was earlier assignedto the General Secretary but, E after the demise of the then General Secretary on 05.12.2016, the party organisation went through a sea of changes and ultimately, a system of joint leadership, by Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator, was established by way of amendment of byelaws on 12.09.2017.However, the propositions for further amendmentshave met with divergent views of different factions within the party and have led to these litigations in as F many as at least five civil suits.The prayers for temporary injunction during the pendency of these civil suits have led to different s at different stages by the High Court of Judicature at Madras on the Original side and on the Appellate side as also by this Court. 3.2. For introductory purposes, we may indicate that in the first G three civil suits, being CS Nos. 102 of 2022, 106 of 2022 and 111 of 2022, 1 ‘AIADMK’, for short; hereinafter also referred to as ‘the party’ or ‘the political party’. 2 Hereinafter referred to as ‘the Executive Committee’. 3 Hereinafter referred to as ‘the General Council’. H 1126 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A various applications seeking interim reliefs were dealt with by an dated 22.06.2022 whereby, the learned Single Judge of the High Court declined to grant any injunction against the meeting of the General Council scheduled to be held on 23.06.2022. This was challenged by one of the plaintiffs in an intra-court appeal, OSA No. 160 of 2022; and therein,by an dated 23.06.2022, as passed after an early morning B hearing, the Division Bench of the High Court,though allowed the said scheduled meeting of the General Council but, placed fetters on its scope by providing that no decision shall be taken on any other matter except 23 items of draft resolution. The said dated 23.06.2022 came to be challenged in this Court in the three appeals arising out of Special Leave C Petition (C) Nos. 11237 of 2022, 11578 of 2022 and 11579 of 2022 in this batch of matters.
