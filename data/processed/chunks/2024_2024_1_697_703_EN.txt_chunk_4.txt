703 Prakashchandra Joshi v. Kuntal Prakashchandra Joshi @ Kuntal Visanji Shah has completely failed and there is no possibility that the parties will cohabit together, and continuation of the formal legal relationship is unjustified. The Court, as a court of equity, is required to also balance the circumstances and the background in which the party opposing the dissolution is placed.” 15. Reverting back to the case in hand, to accord satisfaction as to whether the present is a fit case for exercise of power under Article 142 (1) of the Constitution of India to dissolve the marriage on the ground of irretrievable breakdown, we see that the parties are residing separately since February, 2011 and there have been no contact whatsoever between them during this long period of almost 13 years. The respondent-wife is not even responding to the summons issued by the courts. It seems she is no longer interested in continuing the marital relations with the appellant. Therefore, we have no hesitation in holding that the present is a case of irretrievable breakdown of marriage as there is no possibility of the couple staying together. 16. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed and we dissolve the marriage between the parties on the ground of irretrievable breakdown in exercise of powers under Article 142(1) of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, the marriage between the parties solemnized on 05.01.2004 is dissolved by a decree of divorce. A decree to this effect be drawn accordingly.
