ETC. liberty of the individual is surely relative and regulated. Absolute A liberty is something that cannot be conceived in a societal setting. The law therefore allows authorities to detain accused persons and facilitate investigation. However, it is the duty of this court to discourage prolonged incarceration. The right to default bail is not extinguished by the subsequent filing of the chargesheet, B and the accused continues to have the right to default bail. [Para 42][944-C-E] 1.7 When the day of remand is included in the stipulated period under Section 167(2), the same would encourage the prosecution to promptly comply with Section 57 CrPC. The C leaning towards the accused’s right to personal liberty by reducing the 60 day period to something more than 59 days, and a few hours, is based on the constitutional protection afforded to an accused under Article 22(2) and Article 21. In this way, the Code’s application in dealing with an accused would be consistent with the inviolable right of personal liberty and dignity. [Para 48][947- D C-D] 1.8 Since there exists vacuum in the application and details of Section 167 CrPC, an interpretation which advances the cause of personal liberty is opted. The accused were remanded on 14.05.2020 and as such, the chargesheet ought to have been filed E on or before 12.07.2020 (i.e. the sixtieth day). But the same was filed, only on 13.07.2020 which was the 61st day of their custody. Therefore, the right to default bail accrued to the accused persons on 13.07.2020 at 12:00 AM, midnight, onwards. On that very day, the accused filed their default bail applications at 8:53 AM. F The ED filed the chargesheet, later in the day, at 11:15 AM. Thus, the default bail applications were filed well before the chargesheet. If the accused persons avail their indefeasible right to default bail before the chargesheet/final report is filed, then such right would not stand frustrated or extinguished by any such subsequent filing. The stipulated 60/90 day remand period under G Section 167 CrPC ought to be computed from the date when a Magistrate authorizes remand. If the first day of remand is excluded, the remand period, will extend beyond the permitted 60/90 days’ period resulting in unauthorized detention beyond the period envisaged under Section 167 CrPC. In cases where H 924 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A the chargesheet/final report is filed on or after the 61st/91st day, the accused would be entitled to default bail. The very moment the stipulated 60/90 day remand period expires, an indefeasible right to default bail accrues to the accused. [Para 50][947-G; 948- A-D] B 1.9 The impugned of the High Court granting default bail to the respondents by applying the proviso (a) (ii) of Section 167(2) is found to be in . Hence, the passed by the Single Judge of the High Court is upheld. [Para 51][948-E] State of M.P. Vs. Rustam & Ors. 1995 (Supp) 3 SCC C 221 – per incuriam. Chaganti Satyanarayan Vs.
