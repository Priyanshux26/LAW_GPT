There is no evidence to even remotely suggest that there existed any agreement between Kallu and the co-accused while none of the others, except Kallu, has been convicted for criminal conspiracy. CONCLUSION 42. What could have more aptly summarise the entire prosecution case, especially the fl awed investigation in the matter at hand, than the words of Daniel J. Boorstin, the American historian: “The greatest obstacle to true discovery is not ignorance, but rather the illusion of knowledge”. 43. Against this background, to say that the convictions of Manoj and Kallu can still sustain, appears far-fetched; their convictions cannot be justifi ed solely on the basis of illusory knowledge regarding their involvement in the crime. 44. For all the foregoing reasons, Manoj and Kallu are acquitted and set free. Consequently, conviction of Manoj and Kallu as recorded by the Trial Court and the sentence imposed upon them, since affi rmed by the High Court, stand set aside. Manoj and Kallu are still behind bars. They shall be immediately released from custody, if not wanted in any other case. 45. The appeals are, accordingly, allowed. No costs.
