While the contract was in execution, disputes arose between the parties and through an agreement dated 28.02.2012, a Standing Arbitral Tribunal was constituted for resolution of disputes. The respondent raised 35 claims which were clubbed and classifi ed as twelve disputes. The present proceedings arise out of the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal deciding three disputes, being Dispute I (relating to Claim 9), Dispute III (relating to Claims 12, 22 and 28), and Dispute IV (relating to Claims 13, 23 and 29). 4.

Consequently, the Respondent raised claims for reimbursement of Rs. 1,32,29,771/- incurred on account of payment of Entry Tax. 6. In so far as Dispute IV is concerned, it relates to reimbursement of Toll Tax on machinery and materials. As per the extant policy in Jammu and Kashmir, the Toll Tax as applicable on the date of the submission of tender, that is 31.05.2004, was Rs. 400/- per MT.
