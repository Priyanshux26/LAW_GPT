A legal fiction is a supposition of law that a thing or event exists even though, in reality, it does not exist.153 The word “deemed” is used to treat a thing or event as something, which otherwise it may not have been, with all the attendant consequences.154 The effect of a legal fiction is that “a position which otherwise would not obtain is deemed to obtain under the circumstances.”155 In K Prabhakaran v.

Digital Supreme Court Reports for some definite purpose and the fiction is to be limited to the purpose for which it was created and should not be extended beyond that legitimate field. A legal fiction presupposes the existence of the state of facts which may not exist and then works out the consequences which flow from that state of facts. Such consequences have got to be worked out only to their logical extent having due regard to the purpose for which the legal fiction has been created. Stretching the consequences beyond what logically flows amounts to an illegitimate extension of the purpose of the legal fiction.” 98. A legal fiction is created for a definite purpose and it should be limited to the purpose for which it is enacted or applied.
