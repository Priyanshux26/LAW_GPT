15774 of 2022 596 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. misplaced. The requirement of compulsory registration and eff ect on non- registration emanates from the statutes, in particular the Registration Act and the Transfer of Property Act. The ratio in Suraj Lamps & Industries (supra) only approves the provisions in the two enactments. Earlier s of this Court have taken the same view. 14. In case the respondent wanted to evict the appellant treating him to be a licensee, he could have maintained a suit on behalf of the true owner or the landlord under specifi c instructions of Power of Attorney as landlord claiming to have been receiving rent from the appellant or as Attorney of the true owner to institute the suit on his behalf for eviction and possession. That being not the contents of the plaint, we are unable to agree with the reasoning given by the High Court in the impugned . 15. For all the reasons recorded above, the impugned deserves to be set aside and the suit deserves to be dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The impugned is set aside and the suit is dismissed. 16. There shall be no as to costs. 17. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Divya Pandey
