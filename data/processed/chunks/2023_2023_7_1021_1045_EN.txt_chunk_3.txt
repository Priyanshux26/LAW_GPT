The fact that there were security guards posted in the property is borne out by records. This is why NCLT as well as NCLAT have done a delicate act of balancing, H VICTORY IRON WORKS LTD. v. JITENDRA LOHIA & ANR. 1025 by protecting the interests of Victory to the extent of the land A permitted to be occupied. In fact, Victory does not even have the status of a lessee, but is only a licensee. A license does not create any interest in the immovable property. Therefore, NCLT as well as NCLAT were right in holding that the possession of the Corporate Debtor, of the property needs to be protected. This is B why a direction under Regulation 30 had been issued to the local district administration. [Paras 48 - 50][1044-G; 1045-A-E] Embassy Property Developments Private Limited v.
