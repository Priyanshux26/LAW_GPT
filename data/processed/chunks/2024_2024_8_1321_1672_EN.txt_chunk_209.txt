It further held that Clause (2) provides that the Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the list of the Scheduled Castes specified in the notification issued under Clause (1), any caste, race or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe. The power was thus given to Parliament to modify the notification made by the President under Clause (1). A notification issued under Clause (1) could not be varied by any subsequent notification, thus making the notification by the President final for all times except for modification by law as provided by Clause (2). 38. The said law has also been reiterated by the Five-Judge Bench in case of Bhaiya Lal Vs. Harikishan Singh17 A similar view has been also taken by another Five-Judge Bench in case of State of Maharashtra vs. Milind and Others,18 by holding that: “11. By virtue of powers vested under Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India, the President is empowered to issue public notification for the first time specifying the castes, races or tribes or part of or groups within 16 [1965] 1 SCR 316 : AIR (1965) SC 1269 17 [1965] 2 SCR 877 : AIR (1965) SC 1557 18 [2000] Supp. 5 SCR 65 : (2001) 1 SCC 4 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1615 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. castes, races, or tribes which shall, for the purposes of the Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes in relation to a State or Union Territory, as the case may be. The language and terms of Articles 341 and 342 are identical. What is said in relation to Article 341 mutatis mutandis applies to Article 342. The laudable object of the said articles is to provide additional protection to the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes having regard to social and educational backwardness from which they have been suffering since a considerable length of time. The words “castes” or “tribes” in the expression “Scheduled Castes” and “Scheduled Tribes” are not used in the ordinary sense of the terms but are used in the sense of the definitions contained in Articles 366(24) and 366(25). In this view, a caste is a Scheduled Caste or a tribe is a Scheduled Tribe only if they are included in the President’s s issued under Articles 341 and 342 for the purpose of the Constitution. Exercising the powers vested in him, the President has issued the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) , 1950 and the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) , 1950. Subsequently, some s were issued under the said articles in relation to Union Territories and other States and there have been certain amendments in relation to s issued, by amendment Acts passed by Parliament. 12. Plain language and clear terms of these articles show (1) the President under clause (1) of the said articles may with respect to any State or Union Territory and where it is a State, after consultation with the Governor, by public notification specify the castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within the castes, races or tribes which shall for the purposes of the Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in relation to that State or Union Territory as the case may be; (2) under clause (2) of the said articles, a notification issued under clause (1) cannot be varied by any subsequent notification except by law made by Parliament.
