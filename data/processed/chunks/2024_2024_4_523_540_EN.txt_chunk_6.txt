It may also be noted that the cause of action in questioning the validity of election must relate to the grounds specified in Section 100 of the RP Act. As held in Bhagwati Prasad Dixit ‘Ghorewala’ vs. Rajeev Gandhi4 and in Dhartipakar Madan Lal Agarwal vs. Rajiv Gandhi5, if the allegations contained in the petition do not set out the grounds as contemplated by Section 100 and do not conform to the requirement of Section 81 and 83 of the Act, the pleadings are liable to be struck off and the Election Petition is liable to be rejected under VII, Rule 11 CPC. 14. A beneficial reference of the decision in case of Laxmi Narayan Nayak vs. Ramratan Chaturvedi and Others6 be also made, wherein this Court upon review of the earlier decisions, laid down following principles applicable to election cases involving corrupt practices: - “5. This Court in a catena of decisions has laid down the principles as to the nature of pleadings in election cases, the sum and substance of which being: 4 [1986] 2 SCR 823 : (1986) 4 SCC 78 5 [1987] 3 SCR 369 : (1987) Supp SCC 93 6 [1989] Supp. 2 SCR 581 : (1990) 2 SCC 173 [2024] 4 S.C.R. 533 Karim Uddin Barbhuiya v. Aminul Haque Laskar & Ors. (1) The pleadings of the election petitioner in his petition should be absolutely precise and clear containing all necessary details and particulars as required by law vide Dhartipakar Madan Lal Agarwal v. Rajiv Gandhi [1987 Supp SCC 93] and Kona Prabhakara Rao v. M. Seshagiri Rao [(1982) 1 SCC 442] . (2) The allegations in the election petition should not be vague, general in nature or lacking of materials or frivolous or vexatious because the court is empowered at any stage of the proceedings to strike down or delete pleadings which are suffering from such vices as not raising any triable issue vide Manphul Singh v. Surinder Singh [(1973) 2 SCC 599: (1974) 1 SCR 52], Kona Prabhakara Rao v. M. Seshagiri Rao [(1982) 1 SCC 442] and Dhartipakar Madan Lal Agarwal v. Rajiv Gandhi [1987 Supp SCC 93] . (3) The evidence adduced in support of the pleadings should be of such nature leading to an irresistible conclusion or unimpeachable result that the allegations made, have been committed rendering the election void under Section 100 vide Jumuna Prasad Mukhariya v. Lachhi Ram [(1955) 1 SCR 608 : AIR 1954 SC 686] and Rahim Khan v. Khurshid Ahmed [(1974) 2 SCC 660] . (4) The evidence produced before the court in support of the pleadings must be clear, cogent, satisfactory, credible and positive and also should stand the test of strict and scrupulous scrutiny vide Ram Sharan Yadav v. Thakur Muneshwar Nath Singh [(1984) 4 SCC 649] . (5) It is unsafe in an election case to accept oral evidence at its face value without looking for assurances for some surer circumstances or unimpeachable documents vide Rahim Khan v. Khurshid Ahmed [(1974) 2 SCC 660] , M. Narayana Rao v. G. Venkata Reddy [(1977) 1 SCC 771: (1977) 1 SCR 490] , Lakshmi Raman Acharya v. Chandan Singh [(1977) 534 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
