The Act itself provides for an exhaustive, complete mechanism to revoke the licence of a registered practitioner for professional misconduct. The same G may be done after holding an inquiry and complying with the principles of audi alterum partem. [Para 8][1178-C] 1.2 The punishment handed down to the contemnor is entirely foreign to the Contempt of Courts Act 1971 and, thus, H 1174 GOSTHO BEHARI DAS v. DIPAK KUMAR SANYAL & ORS. 1175 unsustainable. The Court, in awarding such punishment showed A complete disregard for the statutory text of the 1971 Act, which is abundantly clear in respect of the punishment that can be imposed thereunder. [Para 20][1182-D] 1.3 A medical practitioner guilty of contempt of Court may also be so for professional misconduct but the same would depend B on the gravity/nature of the contemptuous conduct of the person in question. They are, however, offences separate and distinct from each other. The former is regulated by the 1971 Act and the latter is under the jurisdiction of the National Medical Commission Act, 2019. [Para 21][1182-E] C 1.4 The Division Bench in the impugned did not consider or discuss this issue nor was any final decision taken by the Single Judge in the subject contempt proceedings.The of the court’s below are set aside.
