The Court of Appeals held that such a condition was “incomprehensible” and discouraged the borrowers from pursuing their claims. The relevant observations are as under: 102 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. “B. Unconscionability 2. Two alternative analyses exist under California law for determining whether a contractual provision will be unenforceable because it is unconscionable. (Perdue v. Crocker National Bank (1985) 38 Cal.3d 913, 925, fn. [216 Cal. Rptr. 345, 702 P.2d 503] [“Both analytical pathways should lead to the same result.”].) The fi rst model set out in Graham v. Scissor-Tail, Inc. (1981) 28 Cal.3d 807 [171 Cal. Rptr. 604, 623 P.2d 165] asks initially whether the contract is one of adhesion. (Id. at p. 819.) Since a contract of adhesion is still fully enforceable, the inquiry then turns to whether enforcement should be denied. First, enforcement will be denied if the contract or provision falls outside the reasonable expectations of the weaker party. (Id. at p. 820.) Second, enforcement will be denied even if it does fall within the reasonable expectations of the parties, but it is unduly oppressive or unconscionable. (Ibid.) The alternative analytical model was set out in A M Produce Co. v. FMC Corp., supra, 135 Cal.App.3d 473. It sought to defi ne what rendered a contract or a contractual provision unconscionable and hence unenforceable under Civil Code section 1670.5 (135 Cal.App.3d at p. 485.) A M concluded that unconscionability has a procedural and a substantive component. (Id. at p. 486.) The procedural component focuses on the factors of oppression and surprise. (Ibid.) Oppression results where there is no real negotiation of contract terms because of unequal bargaining power. (Ibid.) “`Surprise’ involves the extent to which the supposedly agreed-upon terms of the bargain are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.” (Ibid.) The substantive component of unconscionability looks to whether the contract allocates the risks of the bargain in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner. (Id. at p. 487.) To be unenforceable there must be both substantive and procedural unconscionability, though there may be an inverse relation between the two elements. (Ibid.) 3. A contract of adhesion is “a standardized contract, which, imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength, relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or LOMBARDI ENGINEERING LTD. v. UTTARAKHAND JAL 1023 VIDYUT NIGAM LTD. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] reject it.” (Neal v. State Farm Ins. Cos. (1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 690, 694 [10 Cal.Rptr. 781].) 4. The record before us indicates that plaintiff s are individuals of modest means, some self-employed or temporarily jobless, who borrowed relatively small amounts of money, often in response to advertising promising “guaranteed loans.” The loan agreement which they signed included a preprinted form containing an arbitration clause either as the fi nal paragraph on a page entitled “Agreement for Dispute Resolution” or at midpage on a sheet of text, but set apart by the use of boldface type.
