Accordingly, the High Court passed the following : i) We hold that the notification dated 16th November 2016 is legal and valid. However, the said notification will not have retrospective or retroactive application to a land reserved under the development plan which is surrendered and amenity is developed on the said land by the owner or lessee thereof at his own cost prior to 16th November 2016. Such cases will be governed by the Regulation 33(1) and clauses (5) and 6 of Appendix VII. In case of a land reserved for a road, either in development plan under the MRTP Act or under the provisions of the said Act of 1888 and surrender is made and road is developed on or after 17th June 2010 but before 16th November 2016, the FSI or TDR in lieu of amenity will be governed by the Regulation 33(1) as amended on 17th June 2010. ii) We reject the argument that the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Company Limited (supra) is per incuriam. iii) We hold that whether the writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India can be allowed to be invoked on the basis of the said decision or not depends upon the facts of each case and the conduct of the petitioners especially the delay and laches on their part; iv) Writ Petition No.203 of 2014 is allowed. We direct the third respondent-MMRDA to make recommendation to the Mumbai Municipal Corporation for grant of 75% additional FSI/TDR in terms of the aforesaid decision of the Apex Court within a period of two months from [2024] 9 S.C.R. 843 Kukreja Construction Company & Others v. State of Maharashtra & Others today. The Municipal Corporation shall examine the said recommendation and if the petitioners are otherwise entitled to TDR for amenity in terms of the aforesaid decision of the Apex Court, necessary DRC shall be issued within a period of two months from the date on which recommendation of MMRDA is received. v) Writ Petition No.1898 of 2009 is rejected; vi) In Writ Petition No.2262 of 2010, the petitioners will be entitled to additional 100% amenity FSI in terms of the aforesaid decision of the Apex Court provided by producing the documents, they satisfy the Mumbai Municipal Corporation that work was actually carried out by them for developing the recreation grounds and the ground; vii) Writ Petition No.1823 of 2012 is rejected. viii) Writ Petition No.839 of 2015 is rejected. ix) Writ Petition No.2871 of 2015 is rejected. x) Writ Petition No.2107 of 2016 is rejected. xi) Writ Petition No.2170 of 2016 is rejected. xii) Writ Petition No.384 of 2017 is rejected. xiii) Writ Petition No.541 of 2017 is rejected. xiv) Writ Petition No.1860 of 2017 is partly allowed. We direct the Mumbai Municipal Corporation to grant additional FSI in respect of amenity of road as provided by Regulation 33(1) as amended with effect from 17th June 2010. xv) We make it clear that wherever we have held that the petitioners are entitled to 100% amenity TDR in accordance with clause 6 of Appendix VII in terms of the aforesaid decision of the Apex Court, the Mumbai Municipal Corporation will have to examine whether the petitioners are otherwise eligible for grant of TDR.” 4.9 Out of all the writ petitions disposed of, Writ Petition No.203 of 2014 was allowed and a direction was issued to the MMRDA to make recommendations to Mumbai Municipal Corporation for grant of 75% additional FSI/TDR in terms of the decision of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I within two months from the said date 844 [2024] 9 S.C.R.
