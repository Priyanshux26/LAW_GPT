Its accompanying C document carrying the demands of the petitioner for various grants and exemptions as also for converting the subject land to freehold was also without any legal basis. At the relevant point of time, the policy in question only related to theme parks/ amusement parks and it is difficult to see even a logic that the D said Managing Director chose to forward the proposition of the petitioner for consideration of the State Cabinet. In any case, the said letter dated 31.01.2015 was only recommendatory in nature; and even the recommendation had only been to declare the places as tourist destination and to give exemption. The Managing Director of UPSIDC could neither have recommended for E converting the land to freehold nor did he do so. The said letter is of no relevance whatsoever. [Para 16][1092-C-F] 1.9. The letter/communication dated 16.09.2016, which had been a communication received by the petitioner from the Director General Tourism. The petitioner has described this letter F as one of “approval” and has framed the relief in the writ petition on that basis. During the course of submissions too, substantial reliance has been placed on this letter/communication dated 16.09.2016 and the same has been termed as a letter of “approval/ qualification.” As would appear from the record, the petitioner G addressed various communications on 12.12.2016, 30.05.2017 and 19.02.2018 to UPSIDC while asserting that the mall in question had already been declared as theme-based mall and the petitioner-company is entitled to get the subject land converted from leasehold to freehold. [Para 17][1092-F-H] H BHASIN INFOTECH AND INFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATE LTD. 1059 v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH 1.10. Whatsoever had been the composition of the A Committee, it could have only made recommendation for final decision by the competent authority. Merely for presence of the Principal Secretaries of the Departments concerned in the Committee, it cannot be held that its recommendation itself would become a binding decision. Moreover, a close look at the said B communication dated 16.09.2016 makes it evident that even the recommendation had only been to approve the proposal ‘as a theme-based mall.’ It is too far-stretched to read this communication as if the Committee had recommended for grant of freehold rights. Providing freehold land for the purpose of setting up a theme-based mall had entirely different requirements C and had been of entirely different connotations under the amendment Memo dated 03.05.2016. In composition of the said Committee, there was no representative of the agency/ instrumentality directly concerned with the subject land i.e., UPSIDC. Any suggestion or recommendation in relation to the D subject land as also the lease deeds already executed between the petitioner-company and UPSIDC could not have been made without taking into account the stand of UPSIDC. After passing of s dated 20.10.2021 and 13.12.2021 by this Court in W.P. (Crl.) 242 of 2019, the matter was indeed examined by the Industrial Development Section-4 of the Government of Uttar E Pradesh where the director of the petitioner-company was afforded the opportunity of personal hearing on 19.01.2022 through video conferencing and his further representation sent through email on 21.01.2022 was also taken into consideration while passing the impugned dated 24.01.2022.
