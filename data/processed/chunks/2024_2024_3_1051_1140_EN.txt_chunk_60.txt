It is not the case of the Appellant that there was any change in either the route by way of addition of new station or any change in the physical track length of the said route. Thus, a mere change in methodology would not have resulted in a difference of 110 km in the chargeable distance. G. CONCLUSION 137. Thus, we are of the considered opinion, that the chargeable distance of 444 km was illegal, for the following reasons: - (i) That, the effect of the change in methodology on the chargeable distance would not have resulted in a huge difference of 110 km, (ii) That, there had been neither any change in the route by way of addition of new station nor change in the physical track length of the said route, (iii) The letter dated 05.07.2005 itself indicates that the change in the chargeable distance of 444 km was due to an error, and has no bearing with the Ministry of Railway’s letter dated 07.04.2004 introducing the new methodology. 1140 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (iv) The factum of the appellants themselves granting refund without explaining the reason for the same, despite their stance that the respondent is not entitled to any refund. (v) The failure of the appellant in establishing that the chargeable distance of 444 km was the correct chargeable distance as per the law. (vi) Concurrent findings of both, the Railway Claims Tribunal and the High Court on the limited aspect of the actual distance being 333.18 km. 138. Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, we have reached to the conclusion that the said chargeable distance of 444 km was illegal. We find no infirmity with the impugned judgement and passed by the High Court. 139. In the result, the appeals filed by the appellant railway fails, and are hereby dismissed. 140. The parties shall bear their own costs. 141. Pending application(s), if any, also stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan Result of the case: Appeals dismissed.
