In view of the discussion above, the following are our conclusions: a. The Electoral Bond Scheme, the proviso to Section 29C(1) of the Representation of the People Act 1951 (as amended by Section 137 of Finance Act 2017), Section 182(3) of the Companies Act (as amended by Section 154 of the Finance Act 2017), and Section 13A(b) (as amended by Section 11 of Finance Act 2017) are violative of Article 19(1)(a) and unconstitutional; and b. The deletion of the proviso to Section 182(1) of the Companies Act permitting unlimited corporate contributions to political parties is arbitrary and violative of Article 14. [2024] 2 S.C.R. 557 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. 217. We direct the disclosure of information on contributions received by political parties under the Electoral Bond Scheme to give logical and complete effect to our ruling. On 12 April 2019, this Court issued an interim directing that the information of donations received and donations which will be received must be submitted by political parties to the ECI in a sealed cover. This Court directed that political parties submit detailed particulars of the donors as against each Bond, the amount of each bond and the full particulars of the credit received against each bond, namely, the particulars of the bank account to which the amount has been credited and the date on which each such credit was made. During the course of the hearing, Mr Amit Sharma, Counsel for the ECI, stated that the ECI had only collected information on contributions made in 2019 because a reading of Paragraph 14 of the interim indicates that the direction was only limited to contributions made in that year. Paragraphs 13 and 14 of the interim are extracted below: “13. In the above perspective, according to us, the just and proper interim direction would be to require all the political parties who have received donations through Electoral Bonds to submit to the Election Commission of India in sealed cover, detailed particulars of the donors 835 against each bond; the amount of each such bond and the full particulars of the credit received against each bond, namely, the particulars of the bank account to which the amount has been credited and the date of each such credit. 14. The above details will be furnished forthwith in respect of Electoral Bonds received by a political party till date. The details of such other bonds that may be received by such a political party upto the date fixed for issuing such bonds as per the Note of the Ministry of Finance dated 28.2.2019, i.e 15.5.2019 will be submitted on or before 30" May, 2019. The sealed covers will remain in the custody of the Election Commission of India and will abide by such s as may be passed by the Court.” 218. Paragraph 14 of the interim does not limit the operation of Paragraph 13. Paragraph 13 contains a direction in unequivocal [2024] 2 S.C.R. 558 Digital Supreme Court Reports terms to political parties to submit particulars of contributions received through Electoral Bonds to the ECI.
