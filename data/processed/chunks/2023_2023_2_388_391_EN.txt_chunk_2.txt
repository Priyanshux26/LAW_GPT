5.3 From the impugned and passed by the High G Court, it appears that though before the High Court and so stated in the counter, an objection was raised on maintainability of the writ petition, at the instance of the original writ petitioner – subsequent purchaser, the same has not been dealt with by the High Court. The High Court ought to have dealt with the said aspect. Be that it may, the fact remains that the respondent being a subsequent purchaser had no locus to pray for H DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MGS (INDIA) 391 PRIVATE LIMITED & ORS. [M. R. SHAH, J.] lapsing of the acquisition as observed and held by this Court in the A aforesaid decisions. Therefore, the impugned and passed by the High Court is unsustainable. 6. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, both these appeals succeed. The impugned and passed by the High Court is hereby quashed and set aside. There shall not be any B deemed lapse of the acquisition proceedings with respect to the land in question as observed and held by the High Court. Present appeals are accordingly allowed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no as to costs. C Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of. Ankit Gyan Appeals allowed.
