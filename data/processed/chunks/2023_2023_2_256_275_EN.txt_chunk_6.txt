A the Act, 1954 and, in the given circumstances, needs to be interfered with by this Court. 14. Per contra, Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel for the respondents, submits that the respondents Narain Singh and Som Dutt purchased 2 Bighas 18 Biswas and 2 Bighas respectively from the B Bhumidhar Maman Singh by a registered sale deed dated 4th May, 1989. So far as the right, title and interest on the subject property is concerned, it vested in favour of the respondents. The registered sale deed dated 4th May, 1989 has never been questioned by Bhai Ram who could be said to be the person aggrieved by the subsequent sale transaction as has been alleged by the appellants. Even the right claimed by the appellants of C adverse possession is a weak right and not legally sustainable. In this regard, the civil suit which has been filed at their instance is practically a non-starter because of pendency of the present appeal still the appellants have no right, title and interest over the subject property in question. 15. Learned counsel further submits that looking to the scheme of D the Act, 1954 and of Act, 1957, while harmonizing, both are governed in different fields and once the notification has been published under Section 507(a) declaring the land to be urbanized, which in the instant case is not disputed, the mutation proceedings pending under the Act, 1954 stand ceased as the land does not exist to be rural area and, thus, no error has E been committed by the Division Bench of the High Court in returning a finding that all mutation proceedings stand ceased after the publication of the notification under Section 507(a) of the Act, 1957. 16. Learned counsel further submits that this is the consistent view of the Delhi High Court and apart from the impugned, this very question and effect of issuance of the notification under Section F 507(a) of the Act, 1957 was earlier examined by the High Court in Smt. Indu Khorana Vs. Gram Sabha and Others3 which was decided on 26th March, 2010 and after examining the scheme of Act, 1954 and Act, 1957, it was held that once the rural area is declared to be urbanized by issuance of notification under Section 507(a) of the Act, 1957, provisions G of the Act, 1954 cease to apply. 17. Learned counsel further submits that after the matter being examined by the Division Bench of the High Court by two different Benches, this being consistently followed in the later s by the H 3 2010 SCCOnline DEL 1334 MOHINDER SINGH(DEAD) THROUGH LRS AND ANOTHER 265 v. NARAIN SINGH AND OTHERS [AJAY RASTOGI, J.] High Court of Delhi and unless this Court comes to the conclusion that A interpretation as exposed of the Act, 1954 and Act, 1957 are completely perverse and unsustainable, ordinarily may not be interfered with by this Court. 18. Learned counsel further submits that so far as the present respondents are concerned, despite holding right, title and interest in the B subject land in question, pursuant to the registered sale deed dated 4th May, 1989, and their name being mutated at one stage on 31st May, 1989, in the given circumstances, at least appellants have no legal right to hold possession of the subject land although the suit has been filed at the instance of the respondents and submits that this Court may consider C to restore possession in favour of the respondents to avoid multiplicity of litigation in the interest of justice.
