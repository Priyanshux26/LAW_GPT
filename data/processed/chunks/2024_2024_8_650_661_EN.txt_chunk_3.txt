We have heard and considered the submissions advanced by learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the impugned s and the material placed on record. 13. The following facts as emerging from the record are not in dispute:- (i) That appellant-DSGMC demolished a substantial part of the school building without seeking permission from the competent authority, i.e., NDMC, leading to the closure of the school. (ii) That the demolition was undertaken in spite of an interim stay passed by the High Court of Delhi on 30th May, 2005 in Writ Petition(Civil) Nos. 9951-52 of 2005, staying the proposed shifting of the school.

(iv) That the appellant-DSGMC did not challenge the decision of the NDMC dated 14th February, 2006, withdrawing the recognition and the grant-in-aid, before any forum. 656 [2024] 8 S.C.R.
