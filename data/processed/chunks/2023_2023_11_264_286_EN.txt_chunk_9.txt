A person who sets up a plea of adverse possession must establish both possession which is peaceful, open and continuous - possession which meets the requirement of being ‘nec vi nec claim and necprecario’. To substantiate a plea of adverse possession, the character of the possession must be adequate in continuity and in the public because the possession has to be to the knowledge of the true owner in for it to be adverse. These requirements have to be duly established fi rst by adequate pleadings and second by leading suffi cient evidence.” 21.2 The person claiming adverse possession must show clear and cogent evidence substantiate such claim; This Court in Thakur Kishan Singh v. Arvind Kumar15 (two-Judge Bench) held that - “5. A possession of a co-owner or of a licensee or of an agent or a permissive possession to become adverse must be established by cogent and convincing evidence to show hostile animus and possession adverse to the knowledge of real owner. Mere possession for howsoever length of time does not result in converting the permissive possession into adverse possession…” 12 (2015) 17 SCC 1 13 (2019) 8 SCC 729 14 (2020) 1SCC 1 15 (1994) 6 SCC 591 GOVERNMENT OF KERALA & ANR. v. 277 JOSEPH AND OTHERS [SANJAY KAROL, J.] Reference may also be made to M. Siddiq (supra). 21.3 Mere possession over a property for a long period of time does not grant the right of adverse possession on its own; (a) In Gaya Prasad Dikshit v. Dr. Nirmal Chander and Anr. (two-Judge Bench)16, this court observed- “1… It is not merely unauthorised possession on termination of his licence that enables the licensee to claim title by adverse possession but there must be some overt act on the part of the licensee to show that he is claiming adverse title. It is possible that the licensor may not fi le an action for the purpose of recovering possession of the premises from the licensee after terminating his licence but that by itself cannot enable the licensee to claim title by adverse possession. There must be some overt act on the part of the licensee indicating assertion of hostile title. Mere continuance of unauthorised possession even for a period of more than 12 years is not enough.” Reference may also be made to Arvind Kumar (supra); Mallikarjunaiah v. Nanjaiah17 (two-Judge Bench); Uttam Chand (supra). 21.4 Such clear and continuous possession must be accompanied by animus possidendi-the intention to possess or in other words, the intention to dispossess the rightful owner; in Karnataka Board of Wakf (supra) it was observed- “…Physical fact of exclusive possession and the animus possidendi to hold as owner in exclusion to the actual owner are the most important factors that are to be accounted in cases of this nature…” (a) The case of Annakili v. A. Vedanayagam18 (two-Judge Bench) also shed light on this principle as under- “24. Claim by adverse possession has two elements: (1) the possession of the defendant should become adverse to 16 (1984) 2 SCC 286 17 (2019) 15 SCC 756 18 (2007) 14 SCC 308 278 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R.
