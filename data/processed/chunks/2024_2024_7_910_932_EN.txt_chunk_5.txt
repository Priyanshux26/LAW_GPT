FINDINGS OF THE HIGH COURT 11. The aforesaid decisions were challenged by the respondent in a writ petition8 filed before the High Court of Gauhati which was allowed by the learned Single Judge vide dated 27th March, 2018. 8 Writ Petion No. 5986 of 2014 918 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The learned Single Judge set aside the dismissal passed by the appellants against the respondent on the ground that when the respondent was selected for appointment to the post of Constable(GD) and had filled up his Verification Roll stating inter alia there was no criminal case pending against him, he was not aware of the said criminal cases and it was only after the was passed by the appellants on 24th June, 2014, removing him from service that he made inquiries about the criminal case pending against him and that later on, he had been acquitted by the learned Additional Civil Judge(Junior Division), Mainpuri in Criminal Case No. 459/2011. It was also observed that the respondent was fairly young when the incident had taken place and there was possibility of his having committed an indiscretion while furnishing incorrect information in the Verification Roll but not enough for the appellants to have adopted an unduly harsh approach which was disproportionate to the offence allegedly committed by the respondent. As a consequence, the date 24th June, 2014 passed by the Disciplinary Authority and the dated 23rd September, 2014 passed by the Appellate Authority were quashed and set aside and the appellants were directed to reinstate the respondent in service with all consequential benefits along with 50% backwages. At the same time, liberty was granted to the appellants to reconsider the matter and impose a minor punishment on the respondent, as prescribed under Section 11 of the CRPF Act, 1949, if so advised. The aforesaid was unsuccessfully challenged by the appellants in an Intra-Court Appeal9 filed by them which is the subject matter of consideration in the present appeal. ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANTS 12. Ms. Nidhi Khanna, learned counsel for the appellants has assailed the impugned on the ground that the High Court has failed to appreciate that the respondent had committed grave misconduct by suppressing material facts in his Verification Roll about his involvement in Criminal Case No. 459/2011 and Criminal Case No. 537/2011; that the appellants were justified in removing the respondent from service on the ground of suppression of material facts and even on the date 9 Writ Appeal No. 248 of 2018 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 919 Union of India and Others v. Shishu Pal @ Shiv Pal when he was removed from service, Criminal Case No. 537/2011 was pending against him and it was only subsequently that he was acquitted in the said case on 22nd October, 2014 which alone could not improve his case of suppression of material facts; that the offences mentioned in Criminal Cases No. 459/2011 and 537/2011 were grave in nature and the respondent was well aware of the pendency of the said cases at the time of filling up the Verification Roll.
