Thus, the process of readjustment contemplated by sub-section (2) of Section 62 is nothing but the exercise of delimitation under C sub-section (1) of Section 60. [Para 27][539-A-F] 2.5. The provisions of the Delimitation Act 2002 indicate what is readjustment. By virtue of Clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act, the year 2001 stands substituted by the year 2011 in relation to the Legislative D Assembly of the Union Territory of J & K. Under Section 9 of the Delimitation Act, 2002, a specific power has been conferred on the Delimitation Commission of conducting the Delimitation exercise. By virtue of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act, the year 2001 appearing in sub- section (1) of Section 9 of the Delimitation Act, 2002 will have to E be read as 2011. Therefore, the Delimitation Commission established under the dated 6th March 2020 had to undertake the exercise of delimitation or readjustment on the basis of the census figures of 2011 as the earlier exercise of delimitation of the constituencies of the erstwhile State was not F made on the basis of the census figures of 2011. For the reasons stated above, there is nothing illegal about the exercise of delimitation/readjustment of the constituencies undertaken by the Delimitation Commission for the purposes of dividing the Union Territory into 90 constituencies on the basis of the 2011 census figures. [Paras 28 and 29][539-G; 540-D-E; 541-F-H; 542- G A] 2.6. In the First Schedule to the RP Act of 1950, a total of 6 seats were allocated to the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir with no reservation for Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes. H HAJI ABDUL GANI KHAN & ANR. v. UNION OF INDIA & 511 ORS. Section 10 of the J&K Reorganisation Act provides that out of A the 6 seats allocated to the erstwhile State, 5 will be allocated to the Union Territory of J & K and one will be to the Union Territory of Ladakh. That is how Section 11 provides thereof that the Delimitation of Parliamentary Constituencies , 1976 stands amended as provided in the Second Schedule of the said Act. B Thus, the delimitation of the five parliamentary constituencies of the Union Territory of J & K and one constituency of the Union Territory of Ladakh was made by virtue of Section 11 as provided in the Second Schedule. [Para 30][542-B-D] 2.7. Clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 60 of the J&K C Reorganisation Act provides that considering the increase in the number of seats of the Legislative Assembly, the adjustments in the boundaries and description of the extent of the Parliamentary Constituencies in each Union Territory may be made by the Election Commission. Sub-section (3) of Section 62 provides that readjustment of the constituencies as provided in Section 11 in D the successor Union Territories into Parliamentary Constituencies shall be carried out by the Delimitation Commission. The readjustment referred to in sub-section (3) of Section 62 is the adjustment of boundaries and description of the extent of the Parliamentary Constituencies as provided in sub-section (1) of E Section 60.
