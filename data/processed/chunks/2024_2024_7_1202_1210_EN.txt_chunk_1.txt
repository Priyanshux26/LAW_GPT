According to the plaintiff, he had been cultivating the land in question for more than three decades and had also been taking care of Beli Ram.

Further, Vikram Singh had transferred the land in suit in favour of defendant no.2, Smt. Saroj Kumari and also defendant nos.4 and 5, Pankaj Kumar and Pawan Kumar respectively. (b). In view of the interference in possession, Tota Ram instituted a suit for a decree of declaration with consequential relief of [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1205 Duni Chand v. Vikram Singh and Others permanent prohibitory injunction that he was the owner in possession of land in dispute and that the defendants had no right or title to it.
