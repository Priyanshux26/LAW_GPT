The following questions arise for our consideration:- (a) Whether an owner of property can, in his lifetime, transfer said property to his heirs by way of partition? (b) Whether, in the facts of this case, the requisites of a valid gift were met and also whether nomenclature employed in Mutation Entry can be said to be indicative of intentions? FACTUAL MATRIX 3. The brief facts are stated by referring to the parties as per their status in the Trial Court. 1 Hereinafter referred to as ‘Trial Court’ [2024] 12 S.C.R. 927 Mansoor Saheb (Dead) & Ors. v. Salima (D) By Lrs. & Ors. 4. One Sultan Saheb, the owner of the suit land described in Schedule B and C being agricultural land and house property respectively, of the plaint, died on 09.01.1978. Through his first marriage, he had one daughter namely, Ajamunisa (defendant no.11). With his first wife passing away, he remarried and, from this second marriage, had three children- two sons, namely Mansoorsaheb (defendant no.1), Sikandar (defendant no.9) and daughter namely, Rabiyabi. Plaintiff nos.1 to 9 are the children of Rabiyabi, who had died on 08.06.1985. Defendant no.2 is Mansoorsaheb’s wife, defendant nos. 3 to 7 are his children, defendant no.8 is defendant no.1’s daughter-in-law. Defendant no.10 is the son of defendant no.9. For ease of understanding, the position of parties is demonstrated through a family tree: 5. The case of the plaintiffs is that Sultan Saheb was the owner and possessor of the suit property. On his death, defendant no.1 got his name, as also the names of defendant no. 9 & 11 mutated in the revenue records to the exclusion of the plaintiffs’ mother, Rabiyabi, also a successor-in-interest. As such, plaintiffs are entitled to 1/6th share in different scheduled properties and sought partition by way of O.S. No.140/1988. 6. In their written statements, the defendants contended that Sultan Saheb himself had divided the property, R.S.No.249/1A/1, into three parts, gifting one part each to his sons and retaining the third remaining part. Subsequently, in September 1980, he partitioned the retained third portion among his four children.
