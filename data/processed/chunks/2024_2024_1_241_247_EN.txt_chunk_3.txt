12. On the other hand, learned counsel for the complainant has submitted that as of date there is still an outstanding amount of Rs.83,10,000/- and has, therefore, claimed that the complainant would be entitled to receive Rs.83,10,000/- along with compound interest @ 12% p.a. from 15th March, 2019 till actual payment is made along with costs against the appellant as also the intervenor. 13. The intervenor has also filed his response and according to him the partnership between the appellant and the intervenor was in the ratio of 60:40 and that they had actually agreed to pay the settled amount of Rs.4,63,50,000/- in that proportion as per their shares in the firm. It is also his case that the amount of Rs.73,50,000 had been paid by him alone prior to 03.07.2018 during the time when the appeal was pending before the Sessions Court and, therefore, he was entitled to adjustment of the said amount. Further his case is that out of the settled amount to be paid to the complainant i.e. Rs.4,63,50,000/- his share being 40%, the amount liable to be paid by him would be Rs.1,85,00,000/-. As he had paid Rs.73,50,000 earlier he was liable to pay a further amount of Rs.1,11,90,000/-. According to him, he 246 [2024] 1 S.C.R. DIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS has paid the said amount of Rs.1,11,90,000/- after the dated 03.07.2018. The outstanding amount of Rs.83,10,000/- falls in the share of the appellant whose total liability being 60% of the settled amount would come to Rs.2,78,10,000/- and he having paid only Rs.1,95,00,000/- there is a shortfall of Rs.83,10,000/- which the appellant should pay. 14. It is further submitted that the intervenor is being unnecessarily suffering because of remaining amount not being paid by the appellant. It is also the case of the intervenor that as per the e-mails exchanged between them which have been duly placed on record prior to the undertaking dated 03.07.2018, it was decided and agreed between them that the amount would be paid as per their respective shares i.e. in the ratio of 60:40. The said exchange of e-mails and the draft settlement was also shared with the lawyer and the same was duly accepted. The intervenor was not dealing with the lawyer directly and it was the appellant who was dealing with the lawyer. The appellant has mischievously and fraudulently altered the words “as per the respective shares” by substituting it with “equally”. The intervenor was hurriedly made to sign the undertaking on the date it was being filed i.e. 03.07.2018 and he trusted the appellant and the lawyer who was appearing for both of them. It is further stated that the intervenor has also filed before the High Court by way of a modification application to deal with this aspect of the matter, which application is still pending. 15. We have perused the undertaking dated 03.07.2018 as also the dated 03.07.2018 and also the subsequent s passed by the High Court. It is apparent from the same that the complainant was entitled to receive a total amount of Rs.4,63,50,000/-.
