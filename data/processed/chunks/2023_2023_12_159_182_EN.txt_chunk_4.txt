35/8 was not refl ected in all three notices. The said prayer was opposed by NIT by response dated 19.04.1979, contending that Khasra No. 35/8 was part of Khasra Nos. 35/1 and 35/2. However, the SLAO vide LOONKARAN GANDHI (D) THR. LR. v. STATE OF 165 MAHARASHTRA AND ORS.[J. K. MAHESHWARI, J.] date 01.08.1981 separated the papers of the land owner. It is also on record that NIT in furtherance to its letter dated 02.02.1977, informed SLAO on 03.11.1981 that proposal for acquisition of Khasra Nos. 35/1 and 35/2 had been submitted and the interest of various persons shall be determined including the land owner, however, the proposal with respect to Khasra No. 35/8 was still not submitted. 7. The land owner awaiting a proposal from NIT, fi led a claim on 25.11.1981 requesting grant of alternate plot in the same vicinity on the ground that the possession of his land was taken in 1970 and as on date, road is already constructed on the same. In response, NIT vide letter dated 02.06.1982 asked the land owner to prove his title without considering its own reply dated 19.04.1979. Meanwhile, on 22.09.1986, SLAO passed an award for adjoining pieces of land in Khasra Nos. 35/3 and 35/4 and since the papers of land owner were separated, no award was passed with respect to Khasra No. 35/8. Corrected city survey record dated 26.09.1986, recording name of land owner in Khasra No. 35/8 was supplied to him. In view of the corrected records, landowner again submitted a representation to NIT on 17.01.1987 and requested for alternate plot. In reply letter dated 06.03.1987, NIT informed landowner that plot No. 8 in Khasra No. 35 belonging to land owner was under acquisition, and alternate plot cannot be allotted. The land owner was directed to approach SLAO for compensation for the said plot. Having no clear response, the land owner sent a legal notice dated 02.09.1987 to NIT and sought details of acquisition proceedings under which his land was acquired, however, it was of no avail. In the meantime, the land owner made a representation to the Guardian Minister seeking allotment of an alternate plot, which was forwarded to NIT. Pursuant thereto, NIT vide reply dated 19.12.1988 to Guardian Minister admitted that the land of the land owner is under acquisition but grant of alternative plot is not possible. Be that as it may, correspondences were exchanged and fi nally NIT vide letter dated 15.01.1990 apprised the land owner regarding pending acquisition proceedings of his land. Land owner again submitted representation dated 25.07.1990 and 09.04.1991 for grant of alternate plot as compensation, but again to no avail. 8. Aggrieved by the inaction of authorities and delayed response to his representations, on the advice of the advocate, land owner fi led a 166 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. complaint before Consumer Forum, Nagpur, which was withdrawn for want of jurisdiction. Thereafter, the land owner on 29.04.1992 fi led ‘Writ Petition No. 2022/1992’ before High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench praying the above said reliefs.
