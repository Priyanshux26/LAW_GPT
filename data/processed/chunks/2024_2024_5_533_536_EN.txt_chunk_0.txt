Digital Supreme Court Reports Case Arising From CIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Writ Petition (Civil) No. 255 of 2024 (Under Article 32 of The Constitution of India) Appearances for Parties Ms. Madhavi Divan, Sr. Adv., Divyansh Tiwari, Ms. Aishani Narain, Sameer Choudhary, Nirnimesh Dube, Advs. for the Petitioners. Ramji Srinivasan, Sr. Adv., Pramod Dayal, Nikunj Dayal, Ms. Namrata Saraogi, Advs. for the Respondents. / of the Supreme Court 1. The Chartered Accountant Examination for the Intermediate and final course is due to commence on 2 May 2024 and end on 17 May 2024. 2. The bone of contention in these proceedings under Article 32 of the Constitution pertains to two examinations which are scheduled to be held on 8 May 2024 and 14 May 2024. The grievance is that phase-wise polling during the General Elections is scheduled to take place on 7 May and 13 May 2024 and hence, the convening of the examination on the above two days (one day after the phase-wise polling) will cause severe hardship to candidates. 3. Ms Madhavi Divan, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that though there are 816 districts, there are only 290 centres where the examination is being held, as a consequence of which serious hardship may be caused to students coming from remote areas.
