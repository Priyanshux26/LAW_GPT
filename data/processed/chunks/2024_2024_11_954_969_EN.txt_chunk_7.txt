Aggrieved, the State of Rajasthan carried the matter to this Court. During its pendency [2024] 11 S.C.R. 965 Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar & Anr. v. Monika & ors. before this Court, an Hon’ble Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court ruled in the pending writ petition [WP No. 3235/2004] that the settlement entered into between the parties cannot be enforced due to the decision of the Supreme Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3).12 While this Court, no doubt, upheld the settlement deed wherein the respondent awarded bonus marks to the candidates for working in certain ad-hoc positions, it did so in the background of the complex and labyrinthine facts and circumstances that had played out before the Rajasthan High Court. There is no doubt in our mind that this case must be distinguished from the instant case as it does not lay down a general rule regarding the provision of experience marks while working in a contractual/non-regular post, but rather is limited to the enforcement of an already existing settlement agreement between the State and the concerned contractual employees. 18. In a different context, where promotion was the matter of concern before this Court in Union of India v. M. Bhaskar,13 it was held that: “15. The aforesaid decision has been challenged in this appeal by the Union of India by contending that 2 years’ period of experience has to be reckoned, not from 11- 10-1988, but from 21-9-1989. There is no dispute that the eligibility condition is 2 years’ experience in Grade II. Now, this respondent having really started working in Grade II pursuant to the of 21-9-1989, he could not have gained experience prior to the date he had joined pursuant to this . The mere fact that his promotion in Grade II was notionally made effective from 11-10- 1988 cannot be taken to mean that he started gaining experience from that day, because to gain experience one has to work. Notional promotions are given to take care of some injustice, inter alia, because some junior has come to be promoted earlier. But we entertain no doubt that the person promoted to higher grade cannot gain experience from the date of the notional promotion; it has to be from the date of the actual promotion.” (emphasis supplied) 12 [2006] 3 SCR 953 : (2006) 4 SCC 1 13 [1996] Supp. 2 SCR 358 : (1996) 4 SCC 416 966 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 19. Also, while not a decision related to service jurisprudence, in P Kumaraswamy v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal, Madras,14 this Court held that the rule that prescribes marks to applicants who have business or technical experience in the road transport service, did not make any distinction between passenger transport or lorry transport. Upon a perusal of the decision, it is clear that a literal reading of the applicable framework is essential for any determination. 20. Taking a cue from the aforesaid decisions, our observation is this.
