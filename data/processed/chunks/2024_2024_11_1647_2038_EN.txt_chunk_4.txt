1653 Aligarh Muslim University v. Naresh Agarwal & Ors. University was established by a minority for the purpose of promoting the interest of the community – The Court may on a holistic reading of the statutory provisions relating to the administrative set-up of the educational institution deduce if the minority character or the purpose of establishment was relinquished upon incorporation – The question is whether the regulatory measures wrest the administrative control from the founders of the institution – This is a question of fact which must be determined on the facts of each case – The Court must make that determination upon a comprehensive analysis of the administrative framework which includes host of factors such as the representation of the interests of the community in the administrative set-up. [Para 140] 3.7. Taken together, these are the main indicia which assist the Court in determining who established an educational institution under Article 30 – However, the complex nature of establishing an educational institution is not lost on us – Undoubtedly, there can be no straitjacket formula which may be applied – The above indicia of establishment must be considered as a whole, along with any relevant facts which are available to the Court – The matter must be considered in totality and competing factors must be weighed against each other depending on the facts and circumstances of each institution. [Para 141] 3.8. The above indicia must be proved through the submission of cogent material – Reliance must be placed on primary sources such as office documents, letters and resolutions or memorandums issued to implement the resolutions – Secondary sources must only be used to corroborate the primary sources – The onus to prove that the educational institution was established by a minority is on the claimants. [Para 142] 4. The declaration of an institution as one of national importance does not amount to a change in the minority character of the institution – This is for multiple reasons – First, Entries in the Lists in the Seventh Schedule delineate the legislative competence of Parliament and of the legislatures of the States – The State may regulate various aspects of education and educational institutions – The field of legislative competence over universities does not amount 1654 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports to a surrender of minority character – The distribution of legislative competence between Parliament and the State legislatures does not bear upon the minority character of the institution – Second, as a matter of principle, nothing prevents a minority educational institution from being an institution of national importance – The qualities denoted by the terms ‘national’ and ‘minority’ are not at odds with each other nor are they mutually exclusive – The former indicates that the institution has a pan-India or national character, as opposed to relatively more local or regional institutions – It is indicative of the importance of the institution on the national stage – The latter is evidence of the religious or linguistic background of the founders and the constitutional rights which vest in them – Each term indicates distinct attributes which are not antithetical to one another – A university may well be both national and ergo, of national importance, as well as minority in character – There is no reason why a minority educational institution cannot also be an institution of national importance – Third, Entries 63 and 64 provide Parliament with the power to declare an institution to be of national importance – An interpretation that an institution of national importance cannot be a minority institution would amount to rendering the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 30(1) subservient to the legislative power of Parliament – Parliament can in terms of Entries 63 and 64 declare any institution to be of national importance.
