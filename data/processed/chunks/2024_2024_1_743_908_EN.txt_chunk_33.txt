The Presiding Officer (Special Judge, Greater Mumbai) vide a common letter dated 22.03.2021 gave a negative opinion against the premature release of the remaining ten convicts, respondent Nos.4 to 13 herein. That thereafter, for one good year, their case was kept pending and only after 07.03.2022 the new Superintendent of Police, Dahod, gave a ‘no objection’ for the premature release of all the convicts by separate letters of the same date. The District Magistrate, Dahod, also gave a positive opinion in favour of the premature release of all the convicts. On 26.05.2022, a meeting of the Jail Advisory Committee of Gujarat was held and this time, all the members of the Committee gave a positive opinion. The Additional Director General of Police, Prisons and Correctional Administration vide letter dated 09.06.2022 this time gave a positive opinion and did not raise any objection for the release of the ten convicts. 794 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 7.13. That although the reference by the Jail Advisory Committee to the State Government, was only qua respondent Nos.4 to 13, the State Government erroneously recommended the name of respondent No.3 also, to the Central Government for remission even in the absence of any application pending before the State Government. 7.14. Learned counsel for the petitioner next submitted that the Presiding Judge’s reasoned negative opinion opposing the premature release was disregarded and this was contrary to the mandate of Section 432(2) of the CrPC. The remission s dated 10.08.2022 of respondent No.1 are in the teeth of the negative opinion of the Presiding Judge, Special Judge (CBI), Sessions Court, Greater Mumbai, dated 03.01.2020 and 22.03.2021, thereby, defeating the purpose of Section 432(2) of the CrPC. Further, the remission s dated 10.08.2022 are conspicuously silent about the opinion of the Presiding Judge to be mandatorily obtained under Section 432(2) of the CrPC. Not even a reference is made to the said opinion. This amounts to an erasure of record by removing from consideration a document that is statutorily mandated to be considered and judicially held to be determinative. Reliance was placed on Ram Chander to contend that the opinion of the Presiding Judge of the court that convicted the offender will ‘have a determinative effect’ on the exercise of executive discretion under Section 432 of the CrPC. Further, reference was made to the decision of this Court in V.Sriharan, wherein a Constitution Bench of this Court held that the procedure stipulated in Section 432(2) of the CrPC is mandatory and that the opinion of the Presiding Judge of the Court which had tried the convict is critical and an essential safeguard to check that the power of remission is not exercised arbitrarily. 7.15. It was next contended that the premature release was granted illegally as the imprisonment in default for the non-payment of fine was not served. The Trial Court while sentencing the respondents-convicts had also imposed a fine of Rs. 2,000/- on each of them, for each of the fourteen counts of murder and three counts of rape and in the event of default in payment of said fine, sentenced them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a further period of two years each for each count.
