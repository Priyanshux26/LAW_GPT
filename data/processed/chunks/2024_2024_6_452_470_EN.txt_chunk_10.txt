policy no.832471906………………………………………… …………. The opponent wrote letter dated 17.06.1997 in connection of complaint’s notice given through advocate dated 25.03.1997 and 21.04.1997. We have noted that the title of the letter is stated by the opponent that the title of the letter is stated by the opponent that “Re: Policy No. 832471906 addressed to Shri T.S. Nanavati, who gave two legal notices on behalf of the complainants, the opponent have shown their failings to pay exgratia payment sum insured only in full and final settlement of the dues under the aforesaid policy. At this juncture, we have to interpret the said all words used by the LIC i.e. Ex- gratia or basic sum insured only in full and final settlement of the dues under the · above policy all the said words are proving that the opponent have issued the policy and accepted the risk ……………............................................................ …………………………….….. We have also noted that the opponent has deliberately not examined any witness to prove that the decision to accept the proposal was taken by the opponent on 15.07.1996 and the death of the proposer has taken place on 14.07.1996, the contract could not be said to have been concluded and the contract was never in existence. We have noted that the contract was already concluded prior to the death of the policy holder Shri Narendra Kumar Modi, if the opponent were and are in possession of the documentary evidence to prove that the decision to accept the proposal was taken by the opponent on 15.07.1996, then definitely, the opponent would have produced oral or documentary evidence to prove the said facts as this is a crucial point, but the opponent has not taken . any action to produce oral or documentary evidence oat this point i.e. only defense of the opponent in the written statement which amounts to [2024] 6 S.C.R. 467 Mrs. Bhumikaben N. Modi & Ors. v. Life Insurance Corporation of India crush the object of LIC act and other prevailing act to give protection and risk coverage ………………………....…… ...........................................The opponent have not produced their own record to prove that after the receipt of the proposal and cheque of premium of Rs3388/- dated 09.07.1996, the decision to accept the proposal was not taken on 09.07.1996 or immediately within reasonable period 213 days and took only on 15.07.1996………….” 21. Obviously, the said First Premium Receipt contains the number of the policy as 832471906 and the next premium date was shown therein as 28.12.1996. In addition to the aforesaid recitals from the of the District Forum, we are of the view that certain other emerging aspects also assume relevance. 22. Though it is stated, as can be seen from the extracted portion, that the issue of the receipt is subject to the realization of the amount in cash and the terms and condition of acceptance printed overleaf, the printing on overleaf is conspicuously absent in Annexure B. So also, there is no case for the respondent that the cheque issued was dishonored. 23.
