Consequent to the directions dated 22.04.2014, the State Government had sent the requisite recommendation to the Central Government for grant of mining lease of the area in question. The Central Government, however, took the stand that having regard to the amendments in the MMDR Act, 1957, vide the Amendment Act, 2015 introducing Section 10-A, the request made by M/s Bhushan Power and Steel Limited stands invalidated. In view of the aforesaid stand, the Central Government had written letters to the State Government, with a copy sent to M/s Bhushan Power and Steel Limited. In the letter dated 13.05.2015, the Central Government had stated that the proposal for according the prior approval for grant of mineral concession was ineligible in terms of sub-section (1) to Section 10-A of the MMDR Act, 1957 and, therefore, should be treated as closed. However, the State Government might ascertain whether the proposal was safe from ineligibility under Section 10-A of the MMDR Act, 1957 and thereupon the State Government could take action accordingly. Similar view was also expressed by the Central Government in the letter dated 29.05.2015 therein. Consequent to these communications, the State government vide letter dated 09.07.2015 had informed M/s Bhushan Power and Steel Limited that their applications for grant of mining lease had become ineligible as per sub- section (1) to Section 10-A of the MMDR Act, 1957.

This Court in M/s Bhushan Steel and Power Limited15 (supra), specifi cally examined the contention whether in the facts of the said case, clause (c) to sub-section (2) to Section 10-A of the MMDR Act, 1957 could be invoked in view of the contention raised by M/s Bhushan Steel and Power Limited that the Letter of Intent was issued by the State Government for grant of mining lease and, therefore, their application stands protected. The submission was that the recommendation dated 24.05.2014, given by the State Government should be treated as a Letter of Intent by “whatever name called”, as it signifi es the intention to grant mining lease insofar as the State Government is concerned. It was also argued that under the new regime contained under Section 10-A of the MMDR Act, 1957, approval of the Central Government was not even required and the State Government could have proceeded further and granted the lease. 13. The aforesaid arguments did not fi nd favour of this Court in the case of M/s Bhushan Steel and Power Limited (supra) in spite of the earlier of this Court dated 14.03.2012 and the passed in the contempt petition dated 22.04.2014 with the observations therein that there was failure of the State Government to comply with the directions.
