In the result, we pass the following : (i) The appeal is allowed; (ii) The impugned and dated 1st November 2019 passed by the High Court is quashed and set aside; and (iii) The appellant is acquitted of all the charges levelled against him and is directed to be released forthwith if not required in any other case. 18.
