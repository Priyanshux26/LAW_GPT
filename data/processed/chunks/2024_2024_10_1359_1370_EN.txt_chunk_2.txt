The final decree was engrossed on the requisite stamp paper on 19.11.1990. To execute the same, the plaintiff preferred an Execution Petition bearing No.4 of 1991, in which, notice was ed to the defendants / debtors, but, they did not turn up. Ultimately, the Executing Court ed delivery of possession and accordingly, a portion of item no.4 plaint schedule property, as shown in Ex.C2 plan, was delivered to the plaintiff on 22.11.1994. 6. Thereafter, the aforesaid Raghuthaman preferred E.A.No.1 of 1995 in E.P. No.4 of 1991under XXI Rule 99 of the Civil Procedure Code6 for re-delivery of the property mentioned in Ex.C2 plan, claiming independent right, title and interest in the same. Along with this application, he also filed E.A.No.2 of 1995 seeking an of injunction restraining the plaintiff from committing waste till the disposal of EA No.1 of 1995; and E.A.No.3 of 1995 for recovery 3 Gregorian Calendar year 1919 4 Gregorian Calendar year 1945 5 Gregorian Calendar year 1949 6 For short, “CPC” [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1363 Renjith K.G. & Others v. Sheeba of damages to the tune of Rs.25,000/- from the plaintiff for having committed waste in the property. All the three applications were jointly heard and were dismissed, by a common dated 12.08.1997. 7. Aggrieved by the aforesaid passed in E.A. Nos.1 and 3 of 1995, the said Raghuthaman filed Execution First Appeals viz., EFA Nos.6 of 1998 and 7 of 1998, which came to be dismissed by the High Court, by dated 30.05.2007. Seeking to review the said , the respondents herein, who are the legal representatives of the said Raghuthaman, filed R.P.Nos.1107 and 934 of 2007, which came to be allowed, by dated 22.03.2010. Pursuant to the same, E.F.A Nos.6 and 7 of 1998 were re-heard and were eventually, allowed by the High Court, by the dated 11.11.2011 which is impugned herein. 8. The first and foremost contention of the learned counsel appearing for the appellants is that the predecessor of the respondents (Raghuthaman) did not establish his independent right, title or interest in the property in question and he was only a pendente lite transferee and therefore, he cannot resist the execution of a decree filed by the original plaintiff / decree holder.
