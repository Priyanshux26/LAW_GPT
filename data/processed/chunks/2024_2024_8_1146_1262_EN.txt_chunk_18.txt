Rs.33.00 crores. (emphasis added) 3.3.2 In terms of Articles 2 and 5 of the FSA, a Tripartite Agreement was executed between KECML, KPCL and M/s SGS India Private Limited22 on 20th June, 2008. M/s SGS was appointed as a third-party agency for purposes of sampling and analysis of the coal to be received at BTPS. 3.3.3 For the sake of completion of narration, it may be noted here that although the MoC had approved the Mining Plan submitted by KECML on 08th December, 2004 and the FSA referred to above was executed on 09th May, 2007, the actual mining and coal production could be commenced by KECML only in September, 2008 on account of the litigation initiated by M/s Central India Power Company23 against the MoC in relation to the coal block allocated to KPCL. In July, 2003 CIPCO filed a writ petition24 before the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court seeking reallocation of coal blocks allocated to KPCL. On 21st May, 2006, a status quo was passed by the High Court in the said petition and KECML and KPCL were also made parties. The said petition was finally dismissed by the High Court on 10th August, 2006 which dismissal was upheld by this Court on 05th January, 2007. Due to the status quo operating in all this duration, the coal production could commence at site only in September, 2008 and washed coal was supplied by KECML to the BTPS w.e.f. December, 2008. Due to non-supply of washed coal by KPCL as stipulated in Article 6(4) of the JVA and Article 10 of the FSA, KPCL imposed penalties on KECML for the delay. 22 In short ‘SGS’ 23 Hereinafter referred to as ‘CIPCO’ 24 Writ Petition No. 2923 of 2003 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1183 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v.
