DBT, by its letter dated 01.08.2022, also wrote to MoEF&CC for GEAC to consider the recommendation for environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 made in its 133rd GEAC meeting, in light of the biosafety data received from the applicant as well as reviewing the international evidence of safety of the concerned technology. 14.2.15 Thereafter, on 25.08.2022, at the 146th GEAC meeting, the applicant made a detailed presentation on all aspects of the proposal for environmental release of DMH-11. In this meeting of GEAC, it was recommended that an Expert Committee be constituted to examine the request letter dated 10.05.2022, with respect to availability of adequate evidence about impact of transgenic mustard on honey bees and other pollinators, in to assess the need for conducting field demonstration studies on honey bees and other pollinators. The composition of this Expert Committee was as follows: a. Dr. Sanjay Kumar Mishra, Chairman b. Dr. Ashok Kumar Singh, Member (Expertise in Molecular Genetics and Breeding) c. Dr. D.K. Yadav, Member (Expertise in Plant Breeding and Seed) [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2011 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. d. Dr. A.H. Prakash, Member (Expertise in Plant Physiology) e. Dr. K. Annapurna, Member (Expertise in Microbiology) f. Dr. S. J. Rahman, Member (Expertise in Entomology) g. Dr. Nitin K. Jain, Member (Present Member Secretary of RCGM) h. Dr. K. C. Bansal, Member (Expertise in Plant Biotechnology, Functional Genomics) i. Dr. Abhilasha Singh Mathuriya, Member Secretary. 14.2.16 First and second meeting of this Expert Committee were convened on 23.09.2022 and 30.09.2022 respectively. The recommendations of the Expert Committee constituted in 146th meeting were submitted to GEAC and were as under: “Based on the examination of scientific evidences available globally, and as per the recommendations of concerned ministries, it seems unlikely that the bar, barnase, and barstar system will pose an adverse impact on honey bees and other pollinators. Therefore, the Committee was of the view that GEAC may consider the environmental release of GE mustard and further evaluation to be carried out as per ICAR guidelines for release and notification. However, to generate scientific evidences in Indian agro-climatic situation and also as a precautionary mechanism, the Expert Committee suggests that the field demonstration studies with respect to the effect of GE mustard on honey bees and other pollinators, as recommended in the 136th GEAC meeting, may also be conducted post-environmental release, simultaneously by the applicant, within two years under supervision of ICAR and the report be submitted to the GEAC.” 14.2.17 Based on the comments of the DARE and the DBT, and recommendations of the sub-committee, GEAC, in its 147th meeting held on 18.10.2022, recommended environmental 2012 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, which was accepted by the Central Government on 25.10.2022. 14.3 It is clear from a bare perusal of the abovementioned events that the Union of India has taken the decision on the environmental release on the basis of the aforesaid procedure which was followed by GEAC.
