This Court, vide dated 26th October 2010 issued notice and stayed the operation of the impugned final and dated 14th October 2010. 2.19. This Court, vide dated 16th August 2011, granted leave in the matter. III. SUBMISSIONS: 3. We have heard Shri A.N.S. Nadkarni, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant and Shri Lokesh Sinhal, learned Senior Additional Advocate General (‘Sr. AAG’ for short) appearing on behalf of the respondent-State at length. 4. Shri Nadkarni, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that, firstly the findings given by the learned Special Judge in its and dated 22nd/24th February 2007, while convicting Ran Singh and acquitting Surjeet Singh, Angrej Singh and Mehar Deen, wherein adverse findings have been recorded against the appellant, are contrary to the principles of natural justice. It is submitted that no notice was given to the [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1053 Bharti Arora v. The State of Haryana appellant prior to recording of the adverse findings against her and the said findings were recorded ex-parte. 5. Shri Nadkarni submitted that, even on merits, the said findings were totally unwarranted. He submitted that the appellant had served as S.P., Kurukshetra only from 21st May 2004 to 18th March 2005. It is submitted that, during that period, the appellant was neither a part of the raiding team, search team, nor the investigating team, that carried out the operation against Ran Singh on 6th January 2005. It is submitted that even the charge-sheet was filed against the accused persons only after the appellant was transferred from Kurukshetra. It is therefore submitted that no act or omission could be attributed to the appellant covered by Sections 42, 43 and/or 44 of the NDPS Act. He submitted that, as such, on the basis of such bald allegations by the accused persons, at the stage of final hearing, the issuance of notice on the premise that the appellant had committed an offence punishable under Section 58 of the NDPS Act was itself not sustainable. 6. Shri Nadkarni further submitted that the findings of the learned Special Judge are totally contradictory. On one hand, the learned Special Judge came to a specific finding that there was no violation of Sections 42, 50 and 55 of the NDPS Act; on the other hand, the learned Special Judge has issued a notice on the premise that the appellant and the other officers are guilty of an offence punishable under Section 58 of the NDPS Act. It is further submitted that the very approach of the learned Special Judge in issuing notice under Section 58 of the NDPS Act merely two days after the and dated 22nd/24th February 2007 and thereafter rushing the proceedings in a hurried manner would show that the learned Special Judge was predetermined to convict the appellant.
