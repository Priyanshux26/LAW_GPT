Since the point has arisen in this case we think that this is a proper occasion when a larger bench can consider the entire aspect fully. We, therefore, direct that this case may be placed before Hon. The Chief 1948 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Justice for being heard by a bench of at least 7 judges so that S. Azeez Basha’s case may also be considered and the points that arise in this case directly as to the essential conditions or ingredients of the minority institution may also be decided once for all. A large number of jurists including Mr. Seervai, learned counsel for the petitioners Mr. Garg and learned counsel for respondents and interveners Mr. Dikshit and Kaskar have stated that this case requires reconsideration. In view of the urgency it is necessary that the matter should be decided as early as possible we give liberty to the counsel for parties to mention the matter before Chief Justice.” 97. The question of law, as noticed above, was referred to bench of seven Hon’ble Judges by a bench of two judges. It may be noted that Hon’ble CJI at that time was not a part of this bench of two Hon’ble Judges. The said group of matters in Anjuman [supra] were placed before a bench of 11 Judges and was heard along with other writ petitions which culminated into the of TMA Pai Foundation and Ors. v. State of Karnataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481. 98. The 11 Judges bench, inter alia, framed a question vide its dated 26.11.1981, which reads as under: “3(a) What are the indicia for treating an educational institution as a minority educational institution? Would an institution be regarded as a minority educational institution because it was established by a person(s) belonging to a religious or linguistic minority or its being administered by a person(s) belonging to a religious or linguistic minority?” 99. Finally, the larger Bench in TMA Pai [supra] opined that “this question need not be answered by this Bench, it will be dealt by a regular Bench.” Thereafter, the group of matters in case of Anjuman [supra] came to be disposed of vide dated 11.03.2003 D.3.
