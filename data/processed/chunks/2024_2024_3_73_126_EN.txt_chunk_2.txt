01.03.2022 – The balance period of limitation remaining on 15.03.2020 can be calculated by computing the number of days be-tween 15.03.2020 and 27.03.2021, which is the day when the limitation period would have come to an end under ordinary circumstances – The balance period thus comes to 1 year 13 days which became available to the petitioner from 01.03.2022, thereby meaning that the limitation period available to the petitioner for invoking arbitration proceedings would have come to an end on 13.03.2023 – Notice for invocation of arbitration having been issued by the petitioner within three years from the date of accrual of cause of action, the claims cannot be said to be ex-facie dead or time-barred on the date of commence-ment of the arbitration proceedings.
