13. Learned counsel submitted that allotment of symbols by the Appellants to the National Parties and free symbols shown in the Notifi cation for the present elections clearly shows that the same are in conformity with the 1968 . Thus, he submitted, the Appellants are precluded from blowing hot and cold that they cannot and should not be permitted to selectively, as per their whims and fancies, decide as to which provisions under the 1968 would be applicable and which provisions would not. It was submitted that a harmonious reading of Paragraphs 9, 10, 10(A) as also 12 of the 1968 would indicate beyond doubt that in the absence of anything to the contrary, the Appellants were required to be guided by the 1968 in toto, which was also the indication in the letter written by the ECI to R1 and the same view was taken by the Law Department in its Legal Opinion to the Appellants. ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION: 14. The relevant Paragraphs of the 1968 , attention to which was drawn by the learned ASG and the learned counsel for R1, are set out below: “9. Restriction on the allotment of Symbols reserved for State parties in States where such parties are not recognised.— A symbol reserved for a State party in any State— (a) shall not be included in the list of free symbols for any other State or Union territory, and (b) shall not be reserved for any other party which subsequently becomes eligible, on fulfi lment of the conditions specifi ed in paragraph 6, for recognition as a State party in any other State: UNION TERRITORY OF LADAKH v. JAMMU AND KASHMIR 79 NATIONAL CONFERENCE [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] Provided that nothing contained in clause (b) shall apply in relation to a political party, for which the Commission has, immediately before the commencement of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) (Amendment) , 1997, already reserved the same symbol which it has also reserved for some oth-er State party or parties in any other State or States. 10. Concessions to candidates set up by a State party at elections in other States or Union territories.— If a political party, which is recognised as a State party in some State or States, sets up a candidate at an election in a constituency in any other State in which it is not a recognised State party, then such candidate may, to the exclusion of all other candidates in the constituency, be allotted the symbol reserved for that party in the State or States in which it is a recognised State Party, notwithstanding that such symbol is not specifi ed in the list of free symbols for such other State or Union territory, on the fulfi lment of each of the following conditions, namely:— (a) that an application is made to the Commission by the said party for exclusive allotment of that symbol to the candidate set up by it, not later than the third day after the publication in the Offi cial Gazette of the notifi cation calling the election; (b) that the said candidate has made a declaration in his nomination paper that he has been set up by that party at the election and that the party has also fulfi lled the requirements of clauses (b), (c), (d) and (e) of paragraph 13 read with paragraph 13A in respect of such candidate; and (c) that in the opinion of the Commission there is no reasonable ground for refusing the application for such allotment: Provided that nothing contained in this paragraph shall apply to a candidate set up by a State party at an election in any constituency in a State in which that party is not a State Party and where the same symbol is already reserved for some other State Party in that State.
