No. 803/2019 and O.A. No. 178/2019, seeking directions to KPSC to expand the shortlist published for the post of Junior Health Inspector Grade-II in the Malappuram district (Category No. 137/2015). The appellants contended that the number of candidates included in the main list was limited to 81, owing to the unscientific criteria adopted by KPSC in the selection process. They argued that the preparation of separate rank lists for different districts under distinct notifications led to overlapping candidates being included in multiple lists. This resulted in the premature exhaustion of the rank lists due to non-joining of duty, relinquishment of claims, or candidates opting for postings in other preferred districts. Consequently, several vacancies remained unfilled. 5. The KAT, considering the extraordinary circumstances arising from the selection process and the subsequent exhaustion of the rank lists, disposed of the original applications through a common final dated 28.11.2022. The Tribunal directed the State Government to decide on the expansion of the rank lists, taking into account the 1152 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports observations made in its . The State was instructed to place its decision before KPSC within three months, along with appropriate recommendations. KPSC was directed to take further action within two months thereafter. Furthermore, the concerned respondents were directed to provisionally report 50 vacancies from each district to KPSC within two weeks of the . The interim restraining KPSC from advising the last candidate under the open competition quota in the ranked list was also extended until compliance with the Tribunal’s directives. 6. In compliance with the Tribunal’s directions, the appellants and other affected candidates were heard by the Secretary, Personnel and Administration Reforms Department of the Government on 25.01.2023. After considering the matter, the Government decided to recommend the expansion of the rank lists to fill the pending vacancies. Accordingly, a recommendation dated 15.03.2023 was submitted to KPSC for necessary action. However, KPSC, by its letter dated 04.04.2023, rejected the Government’s recommendation, stating that the rank lists had already included sufficient number of candidates based on the reported vacancies at the time of their preparation. KPSC relied on Rule 3 and Rule 4(iv) of the KPSC Rules of Procedure, which empower the KPSC to determine the number of candidates to be included in rank lists based on factors such as the number of vacancies reported and the nature of the post. KPSC also emphasized that the validity period of the rank lists had already expired and that further expansion would create a negative precedent, leading to similar demands in the future. 7. Aggrieved by KPSC’s decision, the appellants filed O.A. Nos. 878/2023 and 893/2023 before the KAT, challenging the letter dated 04.04.2023. The Tribunal, however, dismissed these applications through its dated 09.06.2023. Relying on the s passed by this Court in State of Punjab v. Manjhit Singh & Ors.3 and Ashok Kumar Yadav & Ors. v. State of Haryana4 among others, the Tribunal held that interference with KPSC’s decisions regarding the preparation of rank lists was unwarranted.
