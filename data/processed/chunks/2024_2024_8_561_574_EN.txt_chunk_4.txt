In view of that, according to the State, bond of one surety cannot be mixed up with the bond executed or to be executed in other cases against different crime numbers. Stating so, the State opposes the prayer of the petitioner. 12. Similarly, counter affidavit has been filed by the State of Rajasthan. The State points out that apart from the two FIRs mentioned above, there is one more FIR No. 230 of 2020 registered at Police Station Sadarpur, District Jodhpur, Rajasthan. The State contends that separate sureties are required and a common surety cannot be made liable to pay the amount in excess of the amount of bond that he or she furnishes. The State has also opposed the prayer of the petitioner. 13. Equally, the State of Uttarakhand has averred that separate personal bond and sureties ought to be furnished insofar as the sole FIR pending in the State is concerned. The Superintendent, Bhondsi Jail, Gurugram has also filed a counter affidavit opposing the prayer of the petitioner. 14. The petitioner has also filed an additional affidavit placing on record certain subsequent events pointing out that two more FIRs have been registered against him viz., FIR No. 608 of 2022 registered at Police Station, Vibhuti Khand, District Lucknow, U.P. on 13.09.2022 under Sections 406 and 420 of IPC and FIR No. 141 of 2023 dated 21.05.2023 registered at Police Station Tulsipur, District Balrampur under Section 3(1) of the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986. The petitioner has also averred that insofar as FIR No. 608 of 2022 registered at Police Station Vibhuti Khand is concerned, the petitioner had filed Writ Petition (Criminal) Diary No.20302 of 2024 in this Court. We noticed that the said proceeding is disposed of giving him liberty to approach the High Court. We say nothing more insofar as FIR No. 608 of 2022 is concerned. 15. A prayer is made that the bail granted in FIR No. 222 dated 08.09.2020 registered at P.S. Tulsipur, District Balrampur, U.P. be allowed to 568 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports enure to the benefit of the petitioner in connection with FIR No. 0141 of 2023 dated 21.5.2023 registered at PS Tulsipur, District Balrampur, U.P. We outrightly reject this prayer. The petitioner is at liberty to move appropriate proceedings which may be decided in accordance with law and uninfluenced by the present . We are in the present matter only concerned as to whether insofar as the eleven FIRs are concerned in which bail has already been granted, there could be any for consolidation of sureties and, if so, in what manner. Contentions: 16. We have heard Mr. Prem Prakash, learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned senior counsels and counsels appearing for the respective States. We have considered the documents on record and the arguments advanced by the parties. Analysis and Reasoning: 17. It is undisputed that in the 13 matters set out in the chart hereinabove, the petitioner stands enlarged on bail.
