Another significant fact is that interim relief had been directed and was made payable, to all employees, between 01.01.1996 and 29.03.2010. The issued on 09.04.2010 stated that “interim reliefs paid from 18.09.1996 to 31.12.2005 will not be recovered”. This B demonstrates that those who retired between these dates, and those who continued in service, form part of the same class. Further, there is also no distinction between those in service as on 01.01.2006 but retired before 29.03.2010 and those who continued thereafter. 32. This court held in State of J & K v. Triloki Nath Khosa12 that C “Discrimination is the essence of classification and does violence to the constitutional guarantee of equality only if it rests on an unreasonable basis”. The question is whether the classification, excluding employees who retired before 29.03.2010 and confining pay revision benefits (albeit with effect from 01.01.2006) result in discrimination. D 33. In Maharashtra Forest Guards & Foresters Union v. State of Maharashtra13 there was no quota reserved for the graduate Forest Guard for promotion to the post of Forester. Seventy-five per cent of the posts were to be filled through the regular promotion channel based on seniority and twenty-five per cent “by selection of suitable persons E from amongst the persons holding the post of Forest Guard, on the basis of common merit list prepared by the Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Administration Subordinate Cadre), Maharashtra State, Nagpur, on the basis of result of the “Limited Departmental Competitive Examination…”. A further condition for those attempting the limited departmental exam was imposed, i.e., that F only graduates could apply and appear; that condition was challenged. This court held that the condition was impermissible, as it amounted to creating a class within a class: “The challenge is on the further rigour put on the eligibility to appear in LDCE. The whole purpose of LDCE is to G encourage and facilitate the Forest Guards to get accelerated promotion on the basis of merit. Since seniority is the criterion for promotion to three-fourth of the posts, one- fourth is given a chance to compete in a competitive examination. It is also 12 [1974] 1 SCR 771; (1974) 1 SCC 19 13 [2017] 14 SCR 446; (2018) 1 SCC 149 H 1190 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A to be noted that there is no quota prescribed on the basis of higher educational qualification. The situation would have been different if, in the first place, there had been a classification wherein 75% of the posts have to be filled based on seniority and 25% reserved for graduates and again subject to inter se merit in the competitive examination. That B is not the situation in the present case. The LDCE is meant for selection for promotion from the entire lot of Forest Guards irrespective of seniority but subject to minimum five years of service. In that situation, introducing an additional restriction of graduation for participation in LDCE without there being C any quota reserved for graduates will be discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India since it creates a class within a class.
