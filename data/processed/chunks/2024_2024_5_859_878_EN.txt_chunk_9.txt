Reference may be had to the law laid down by this Court in Atma Ram Properties (P) Ltd. v. Federal Motors (P) Ltd. [(2005) 1 SCC 705].” This position was reiterated in Achal Misra (2) v. Rama Shankar Singh & Ors.9. 17.4 The power to grant stay on the execution proceedings which would then result into an for payment of mesne profit is what has been described as incidental or subject to the final outcome of the case. This Court has observed, in G.L. Vijain v. K. Shankar10 as under - “10. It must be borne in mind that incidental power is to be exercised in aid to the final proceedings. In other words an passed in the incidental proceedings will have a direct bearing on the result of the suit. Such proceedings which are in aid of the final proceedings cannot, thus, be held to be on a par with supplemental proceedings which may not have anything to do with the ultimate result of the suit. 11. Such a supplemental proceeding is initiated with a view to prevent the ends of justice from being defeated. Supplemental proceedings may not be taken recourse to in a routine manner but only when an exigency of situation arises therefor. The s passed in the supplemental proceedings may sometimes cause hardships to the other side and, thus, are required to be taken recourse to when it is necessary in the interest of justice and not otherwise. 9 [2006] Supp. 1 SCR 617 : (2006) 11 SCC 498 10 [2006] Supp. 9 SCR 583 : (2006) 13 SCC 136 874 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports There are well-defined parameters laid down by the Court from time to time as regards the applicability of the supplemental proceedings. 12. Incidental proceedings are, however, taken recourse to in aid of the ultimate decision of the suit which would mean that any passed in terms thereof, subject to the rules prescribed therefor, may have a bearing on the merit of the matter. Any passed in aid of the suit is ancillary power.” 17.5 This Court in Martin and Harris (P) Ltd. v. Rajendra Mehta11 speaking through one of us (J.K. Maheshwari, J.) observed that - “18. Thus, after passing the decree of eviction the tenancy terminates and from the said date the landlord is entitled for mesne profits or compensation depriving him from the use of the premises. The view taken in Atma Ram [Atma Ram Properties (P) Ltd. v. Federal Motors (P) Ltd., (2005) 1 SCC 705] has been reaffirmed in State of Maharashtra v. Super Max International (P) Ltd. [State of Maharashtra v. Super Max International (P) Ltd., (2009) 9 SCC 772 : (2009) 3 SCC (Civ) 857] by three-Judge Bench of this Court. Therefore, looking to the fact that the decree of eviction passed by the trial court on 3-3-2016 has been confirmed in appeal; against which second appeal is pending, however, after stay on being asked the direction to pay mesne profits or compensation issued by the High Court is in consonance to the law laid down by this Court, which is just, equitable and reasonable.
