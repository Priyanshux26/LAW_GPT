For ready reference questions framed thereunder and answer to those questions, are reproduced herein below : “Question No.1 : Whether the District Forum has power to extend the time for filing of response to the complaint beyond the period of 15 days, in addition to 30 days, as envisaged under Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act? Question No.2 : What would be the commencing point of limitation of 30 days under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986? xxx xxx xxx 62. To conclude, we hold that our answer to the first question is that the District Forum has no power to extend the time for filing the response to the complaint beyond the period of 15 days in addition to 30 days as is envisaged under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act; and the answer to the second question is that the commencing point of limitation of 30 days under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act would be from the date of receipt of the [2024] 9 S.C.R. 643 Ricardo Constructions Pvt. Ltd. v. Ravi Kuckian & Others notice accompanied with the complaint by the opposite party, and not mere receipt of the notice of the complaint.” 9.1 If we examine the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the same are in the line with the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. 10. Argument raised by the learned counsel for the appellant is that the copy of the complaint was not served upon him. The Commission had put onus on the appellant to have not made any attempt to get the copy of the complaint. However, the fact remains that the Commission has merely recorded in its dated 06.02.2024 that the notice was accepted by the counsel for the appellant in Court and he was granted time to file the vakalatnama and written statement. The does not record that copy of the complaint has been supplied by the counsel for the complainants to the counsel for the opposite party No.1/the appellant herein. Any such observation by the Commission in its would have clinched the issue. It is not a case where along with the notice, copy of the complaint was accompanied. Therefore, it may be too harsh to foreclose anyone’s right to file written statement merely on conjectures and surmises. 11. For the reasons mentioned above, the present appeal is allowed. The impugned passed by the Commission insofar it foreclosed the right of the appellant to file written statement is hereby set aside. The appellant is permitted to file written statement on or before 14.10.2024. The respondent Nos.1 to 31/complainants shall be at liberty to file replication, if any, by 06.11.2024 and the affidavit of evidence on or before 09.12.2024. The matter shall remain fixed on 09.01.2025 for the purpose already mentioned. The appellant is permitted to file written statement subject to payment of costs of ₹1,00,000/- each to respondent Nos.1 to 31/complainants. The payment of costs shall be a condition precedent for acceptance of written statement on record.
