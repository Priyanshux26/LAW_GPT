The dated 21 October 2022 was to be effective A from 1 November 2022. 20. Eventually, on 24 December 2022, another was issued by the Registrar of NCLAT in the following terms: “It is seen that appeals are e-filed from different parts of the B country where the appellant in some cases is located in far away places and time is taken to file physical copy. It is further seen that physical copy is filed within seven days of e-filing. Hence, with regard to computation of limitation in Appeals, following directions are hereby issued by the Competent C Authority: - (1) The F.No.10/37/2018-NCLAT dated 21.10.2022 is hereby withdrawn and superseded by this . (2) Limitation shall be computed from the date of e-filing. The hard copy has to be filed within 7 days of e-filing. However, the D competent authority is at liberty to notify to extend the period of filing hard copy in case of any unforeseen exigency. In a case where hard copy is filed after 7 days, the appeal will be placed before the Tribunal for appropriate . (3) The requirement of filing Appeals by electronic mode shall E continue along with mandatory filing of the Appeals as per Rule 22 of the NCLAT Rules, 2016. (4) This will be effective with immediate effect. All concerned shall ensure that Appeals are presented as per Rule 22 of the NCLAT Rules, 2016 within the period of limitation at the F filing counter.” 21. Hence, by the dated 24 December 2022, it was clarified that limitation shall be computed with reference to the date of e-filing while the physical copy would have to be filed within seven days of e- filing. The clarifies that the requirement of filing appeals by the G electronic mode shall continue together with the mandatory filing of appeals in terms of Rule 22 of the NCLAT Rules 2016. 22. Having regard to the above sequence of Rules and administrative s, it is evident that on the one hand, Rule 22 of the NCLAT Rules 2016 requires the presentation of an appeal at the filing H 1172 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A counter in the prescribed mode, but on the other, NCLAT also envisages e-filing of appeals. This is made evident in the SOP dated 3 January 2021 which mandates the filing of a physical copy of an appeal as per the procedure prescribed in the NCLAT Rules 2016, while referring to the procedure for the hearing of cases through the virtual mode, using the e-filing portal. The subsequent dated 21 October 2022 B acknowledges that there was an absence of clarity in regard to the period with reference to which limitation would commence. Hence, the purported to state that the period of limitation shall be computed from the date of the presentation of an appeal under Rule 22. Significantly, the above was to be effective from 1 November 2022. In the C present case, admittedly, the appeal was e-filed on 10 October 2022 and even a physical copy was lodged on 31 October 2022 prior to the date on which the of the Registrar dated 21 October 2022 was to come into effect.
