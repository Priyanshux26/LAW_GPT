4. Present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri Padmesh Mishra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents. H M/S. SHREE VISHNU CONSTRUCTIONS v. THE ENGINEER IN 339 CHIEF MILITARY ENGINEERING SERVICE [M. R. SHAH, J.] 4.1 It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing A on behalf of the respondents that as such the Hon’ble High Court has rightly dismissed the Section 11(6) application by observing and holding that the pre-amendment Arbitration Act, 2015 shall be applicable. 4.2 It is submitted that in the present case, admittedly the notice invoking the arbitration was issued on 20.12.2013, i.e., much prior to the B Amendment Act, 2015. It is further submitted that admittedly the application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 was preferred and filed on 27.04.2016, i.e., much after the Amendment Act, 2015 came into force. It is submitted that therefore, taking into consideration section 26 of the Amendment Act, 2015 and when the notice invoking the arbitration C was issued much prior to the Amendment Act, 2015, therefore, the arbitration proceedings can be said to have commenced on 20.12.2013 and therefore, pre-Amendment Act, 2015 shall be applicable and not the Amendment Act, 2015. 4.3 Now, insofar as the reliance placed upon the decision of this D Court in the case of BCCI (supra) relied upon on behalf of the appellant is concerned, it is submitted that the decision in the case of BCCI (supra) and the subsequent decisions following the BCCI (supra) are all with respect to the proceedings under Sections 34 and 36 of the Act, 1996. It is submitted that therefore, considering Sections 34 and 36 proceedings as judicial/court proceedings, this Hon’ble Court has interpreted Section E 26, bifurcating Section 26 into two parts and to that it is observed and held that with respect to judicial proceedings under Sections 34 and 36, the Amendment Act, 2015 shall be applicable. It is submitted that, however, on the other hand, there is a direct decision of this Hon’ble Court in the case of Parmar Construction Company (supra) dealing with the very F issue of application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 and in the said decision it is specifically observed and held that so far as the application under Section 11(6)of the Act, 1996 is concerned, in case the notice invoking the arbitration is invoked prior to the Amendment Act, 2015, pre Amendment Act, 2015 shall be applicable. It is submitted that as such the decision of this Court in the case of Parmar Construction G Company (supra), which is a Two Judge Bench decision has been subsequently considered and followed by a Three Judge Bench in the case of Pradeep Vinod Construction Company (supra). 4.4 It is further submitted that in the case of BCCI (supra), this Court has unequivocally held that from the scheme contained in Section H 340 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 26 of the Amendment Act, it is clear that the Amendment Act is prospective in nature and will only apply to those arbitral proceedings that commence in terms of Section 21 of the Act, on or after the Amendment Act, and to Court proceedings, which have commenced on or after the Amendment Act came into force.
