Sections 140(2) and (3) of the Act deal with resignation of auditors H 968 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A and Section 140(4) of the Act deals with giving of special notice at an AGM for appointment of an auditor other than the retiring auditor and the process in that regard. It is submitted that if an auditor of a company is acting directly or indirectly in a fraudulent manner or is abetting or colluding in fraud with the management of a company, Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 empowers either the Central Government or any person B concerned to approach the NCLT for recourse. Section 140(5) of the Act also enables the NCLT to take action suo motu against an auditor who has acted in the aforesaid manner. It is submitted that in addition, Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 has also two provisos and two explanations. It is submitted that therefore as per the first proviso to C Section 140(5), on an application made by the Central Government and if the Tribunal is satisfied that any change of the auditor is required, the Tribunal shall within fifteen days of receipt of such application make an that the said auditor shall not function as an auditor and the Central government may appoint another auditor in his place. It is submitted that second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act provides that an auditor, D whether individual or firm, against whom final has been passed by the Tribunal under section 140(5) shall not be eligible to be appointed as an auditor of any company for a period of five years from the date of passing of the and the auditor shall also be liable for action under Section 447. It is submitted that therefore merely because during the E pendency of the proceedings under Section 140(5) of the Act the auditor resigns, the proceedings under Section 140(5) do not come to an end. Still and after the final is passed, in that case, a further as per second proviso to Section 140(5) can be passed to render such a auditor ineligible to be appointed as an auditor of any company for a period of five years from the date of passing of the and even such F auditor shall also be liable for the action under section 447 of the Companies Act. It is submitted that therefore the High Court has materially erred in observing and holding that once the auditor has resigned thereafter the application under section 140(5) of the Act shall not be maintainable and/or is not required to be proceeded further.
