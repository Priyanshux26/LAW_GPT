The child cannot be used as a pawn to show that the mother of the child was living G in adultery. It is always open to the respondent husband to prove by other evidence, the adulterous conduct of the wife, but the child’s right to identity should not be allowed to be sacrificed.

APARNA AJINKYA FIRODIA v. AJINKYA ARUN FIRODIA 693 The s of the Court were delivered by A NAGARATHNA, J. Leave granted. 2. Indian Law has proceeded on the assumption that parents are persons who beget a child or who assume the legal obligations of B parenthood through formal adoption of child. Under the Indian legal spectrum, a husband is strongly presumed to be the father of a child born to his wife. Thus, there is a strong presumption regarding the paternity of a child. This presumption can be overcome only by evidence precluding any procreative role of the husband, such as by showing that C the husband and wife had no access to each other at the relevant time of possible conception. In the absence of proof of non-access, the law considers the husband’s paternity to be conclusively established if they cohabited when the child was likely to have been conceived. By allowing rebuttal with proof, that the husband could not have been the biological father, the marital presumption was implicitly premised, in part, on a D policy linking parenthood with biological reproduction and on an assumption about the probability of the husband’s genetic contribution.
