1) are here before this Court with E the present appeals. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS 20. Mr. R. Basant, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants vehemently submitted that the courts below committed a serious error in recording a finding that the properties in Schedule ‘J’ (1 to 8 F properties) were self-acquired properties of Late Shri Kumar Sahoo. According to Mr. Basant all the properties devolving upon the Plaintiff and Defendants are ancestral in nature. 21. It was submitted that there is nothing on record to indicate that Late Shri Kumar Sahoo had any independent source of income G through which, he during his lifetime had acquired certain properties which, does not form part of the ancestral properties. According to Mr. Basant, the J series properties (1 to 8 properties) were bought by Late Shri Kumar Sahoo with the aid of the income derived from the ancestral properties and in such circumstances, the J series (1 to 8 properties) H 38 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A would form part of the same nucleus of existing ancestral properties which could now be said to have been devolved on the Plaintiff and the Defendants as ancestral properties. 22. Mr. Basant, thereafter, addressed the Court on the effect of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 (for short, ‘the B Amendment Act, 2005’ or ‘2005 Amendment’) to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (for short, ‘the Act 1956’). He submitted that the Respondent should not be allowed to raise the plea of effecting rights under the amendment to Section 6 of the Act 1956 after these many years. He further submitted that assuming for the moment that the 2005 Amendment has altered the rights of the parties, more particularly, the sisters as co- C parceners, however, in view of the settlement deed, the rights of the Respondent No. 2 (herein Original Defendant No. 2) could be said to have been extinguished and transferred to the Appellants. He submitted that the transfer by the Defendant No. 2 of her entire share in favour of the Defendant No. 1 would be a disposition of her share/rights in the suit D properties. The disposition which took place in 1991 cannot be permitted to be unsettled in view of the 2005 Amendment. 23. He submitted that the retrospective effect of the 2005 Amendment would cause havoc to the alienation made between 1965 and 2005 and in such circumstances, the rights of the Respondent No. 1 E (Plaintiff), if any, would accrue to the heirs qua the unalienated/ encumbered ancestral property, as available with the nucleus of the joint family property with effect from 20.12.2004 only. 24. Mr. Basant submitted that as the alienations which might have been taken place prior to 20.12.2004 cannot be reopened in to ascertain which properties are available for partition, the matter should F be remitted to the Trial Court. 25. He further submitted that in accordance with the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the Act 1956 (as amended on 9.09.2005) no disposition or alienation including partition or testamentary disposition of property which took place before 20.12.2004 shall be invalidated or G set aside on account of the 2005 Amendment.
