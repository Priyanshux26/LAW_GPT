The words used in Section 271C(1)(a) are very clear and the relevant words used are “fails to deduct.” It does not speak about belated remittance of the TDS. The penal provisions are D required to be construed strictly and literally. The penal provision are required to be read as they are. Nothing is to be added or nothing is to be taken out of the penal provision. Therefore, on plain reading of Section 271C of the Act, 1961, there shall not be penalty leviable on belated remittance of the TDS after the same E is deducted by the assessee. Section 271C of the Income Tax Act is quite categoric. Its scope and extent of application is discernible from the provision itself, in unambiguous terms. When the non-deduction of the whole or any part of the tax, as required by or under the various instances/provisions of Chapter XVIIB would invite penalty under Clause 271C(1)(a); only a limited text, F involving sub-section (2) of Section 115O or covered by the second proviso to Section 194B alone would constitute an instance where penalty can be imposed in terms of Section 271C(1)(b) of the Act, namely, on non-payment. It is not for the Court to read something more into it, contrary to the intent and G legislative wisdom. [Paras 7.5, 7.6][393-A-G] 1.2 Wherever the Parliament wanted to have the consequences of non-payment and/or belated remittance/payment of the TDS, the Parliament/Legislature has provided the same H 384 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A like in Section 201(1A) and Section 276B of the Act. Section 201(1A) provides that in case a tax has been deducted at source but the same is subsequently remitted may be belatedly or after some days, such a person is liable to pay the interest as provided under Section 201(1A) of the Act. The levy of interest under Section 201(1A) thus can be said to be compensatory in nature B on belated remittance of the TDS after deducting the same. Therefore, consequences of non-payment/belated remittance/ payment of the TDS are specifically provided under Section 201(1A). Similarly, Section 276B talks about the prosecution on failure to pay the TDS after deducting the same. Section 271C C has been amended subsequently in the year 1997 providing Sections 271C(1)(a) and 271C(1)(b). As observed hereinabove, fails to pay the whole or any part of the tax would be falling under Section 271C(1)(b) and the word used between 271C(1)(a) and 271C(1)(b) is “or”. Section 276B provides for prosecution in case of failure to “pay” tax to the credit of Central Government. The D word “pay” is missing in Section 271C(1)(a). [Paras 7.7-7.9][393- H; 394-A-D] 1.3 CBDT’s Circular No. 551 dated 23.01.1998 as such favours the assessee. Circular No. 551 deals with the circumstances under which Section 271C was introduced in the E Statute, for levy of penalty. On fair reading of said CBDT’s circular, it talks about the levy of penalty on failure to deduct tax at source. It also takes note of the fact that if there is any delay in remitting the tax, it will attract payment of interest under Section 201(1A) of the Act and because of the gravity of the mischief involved, it F may involve prosecution proceedings as well, under Section 276B of the Act.
