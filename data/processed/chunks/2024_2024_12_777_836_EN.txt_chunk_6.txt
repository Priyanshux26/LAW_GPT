that the proceeding be stayed till a decision is arrived at in the case pending against Ashok Dixit before the CJM, Firozabad, concerning Case Crime No. 617 of 2007. The High Court vide its dated 25.08.2009 stayed the proceedings in Case No. 15003 of 2007 by observing as follows: “12. In the light of the above legal position, the Appellant who is a complainant in the criminal case in connection with Crime No.617 of 2007 registered against respondent No.2 at Firozabad has locus standi to file this petition under section 482 of Cr.P.C. Now legal aspect and circumstances of the case is to be considered. Suppose for the sake of argument, if respondent No.2 admits his guilt in the case of Excise Act pending in the Court of CJM Gwalior what will be its effect? He will have a good ground of alibi that at the time of alleged murder of Appellant’s brother he was not present at Firozabad but was present at Gwalior which is 160 Kms. away from Firozabad. So it will cause a great prejudice in that case and on the other hand, in the interest of justice, if proceedings pending in the court of CJM Gwalior are stayed, it will not cause any prejudice to respondent No.2. Moreover, it will avoid conflicting s of two Courts. Therefore, it is good case for invoking inherent powers of the court. 13. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, petition is allowed and further proceedings pending in the court of CJM Gwalior in connection with Excise. Act pending in the CJM Gwalior concerning Case No.15003 of 2007 are hereby stayed till disposal of the Criminal Case pending at Firozabad concerning Crime No.617 of 2007.” (emphasis supplied) 14. After a period of almost one year, on 25.10.2008, the IO at Dakshin, Firozabad recorded the statements of two persons i.e., Ramesh Yadav and Barelal under Section 161 CrPC. Both stated that they had witnessed the respondent no.1 being directly involved in the creation of a false case under Section 34 of the Excise Act in to provide the accused Ashok Dixit the benefit of an alibi. Soon thereafter, on 03.11.2008, a supplementary Charge Sheet No. 3A of 2008 in case Crime No. 617 of 2007 was filed against the respondent 786 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports no. 1 for the offence punishable under Sections 147, 148, 149, 307, 302, 201 and 120-B IPC respectively for being involved in hatching a conspiracy of murder that occurred in Firozabad. It was the case of the IO at Firozabad that the Charge Sheet was filed since he had found out that the respondent no. 1 was not posted at the Murar Police Station, Gwalior at the time of the arrest of Ashok Dixit for the offence under Section 34 of the Excise Act and therefore, the provision of sanction under Section 197 CrPC would not be attracted against the respondent no. 1. It is pertinent to observe here that it is the case of the respondent no.
