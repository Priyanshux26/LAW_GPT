The defendant extended the period of three months’ time by another week from that day and if he did not get any information from their side, he would give the site to some other party. Thereafter, after waiting 1352 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports for two more months, legal notice was given through Advocate to the plaintiffs on 18.11.1981 stating that, as he had failed to get the sale deed executed within three months after payment of balance amount of Rs.17,000/-, defendant no.1 has forfeited his earnest money; the agreement dated 24.05.1981 has come to an end, and; as such, he had lost all interest and right over the said property and had also lost the earnest money because of its forfeiture. It was also stated that he was not in a position to pay the balance amount of the sale price. 5. A reply was given by the plaintiffs through their Advocate on 02.12.1981 stating that the plaintiffs had not only given Rs.12,000/- as advance money but had further given additional Rs.2,000/-, for which no receipt was issued. Thus, the total advance amount was Rs.14,000/-. It was also stated that as per the agreement, although the period mentioned was three months, but there was a further stipulation that as there was restriction for registering the sale deeds pertaining to similar revenue sites, as such, it was only after cancelling of such restrictions by the Government that the sale deed was to be registered. As such, the agreement would be alive till the Government lifts the ban on registering the sale deeds pertaining to similar revenue sites. It further mentioned that as soon as registration of documents is opened, they would get the sale deed registered. It was also stated that forfeiture of the amount was without any right and the agreement could not be treated as cancelled. It was also denied that plaintiffs did not have money to pay the balance sale price. 6. In response to the above reply, defendant no.1, through his counsel, again replied on 11.12.1981 denying the payment of additional amount of Rs.2,000/-. It further stated that the contract had been entered because of urgent need of money by the defendants and the price for sale had been lowered to Rs.29,000/- because of urgency, even though the property was then valued at more than Rs.50,000/-. The balance amount was to be paid, in any case, within three months, which plaintiffs had failed to do, as such, the forfeiture had been rightly done. It was also stated that plaintiffs had been deliberately delaying and that they were never ready from the very beginning with the funds. Plaintiffs did not give any reply to the communication dated 11.12.1981. 7. After above correspondence, the defendants executed two sale deeds on 22nd April, 1983 and on 22nd June, 1983 in favour of defendant nos.6 and 7 of part of the land agreed to be sold to the plaintiffs.
