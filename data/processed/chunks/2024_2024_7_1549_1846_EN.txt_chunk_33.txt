2. Parliament enacted the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 19571 in exercise of its legislative powers under Article 246 of the Constitution. The subject which the legislation predominantly covers is relatable to Entry 54 of List I. The MMDR Act is a comprehensive code for the regulation of mines and development of minerals. Section 9 provides that the holder of a mining lease shall pay royalty in respect of any mineral removed or consumed from the leased area at the specified rates. In India Cement Ltd. v. State of Tamil Nadu,2 a seven-Judge Bench of this Court held that royalty is tax and the state legislatures lack competence to levy taxes on mineral rights because the subject- matter is covered by the MMDR Act. The Court also held that royalty cannot be used by the State legislature as a measure of tax on mineral-bearing lands under Entry 49 of List II. Later in time, in State of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Ltd.3 a Constitution Bench of this Court held that the decision in India Cement (supra) stemmed from an inadvertent error and clarified that royalty is not a tax. 3. In the aftermath of India Cement (supra) and Kesoram (supra), State legislatures exercised their legislative powers to impose taxes on mineral-bearing land in pursuance of Entry 49 of List II by applying 1 “MMDR Act” 2 [1989] Supp. 1 SCR 692 : (1990) 1 SCC 12 [34] 3 [2004] 1 SCR 564 : (2004) 10 SCC 201 [71] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1593 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. the mineral value or royalty as the measure of the tax.4 States such as Rajasthan5 and Uttar Pradesh6 also sought to impose environment and health cess and fees for transporting coal and coal-dust collected from mines. The constitutional validity of these levies was challenged before the High Courts on the ground that they were beyond the legislative competence of the State legislatures. The levies were also assailed on the ground that they were in violation of the law laid down in India Cement (supra). 4. One such matter is Civil Appeal No. 4056-64 of 1999, where the petitioners initially filed writ petitions before the High Court of Judicature at Patna challenging the validity of the Bihar Coal Mining Area Development Authority (Amendment) Act 1992 and the Bihar Mineral Area Development Authority (Land Use Tax) Rules 1994, which levied tax7 on land being used for mining. Relying on India Cement (supra), the High Court allowed the petition by holding that the tax was not within the scope of Entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule. The correctness of the High Court’s decision was assailed before this Court. On 30 March 2011, a Bench of three Judges noticed the divergence between India Cement (supra) and Kesoram (supra) and referred the following questions to a Bench of nine Judges to provide a decisive ruling: a. Whether ‘royalty’ determined under Sections 9/15(3) of the MMDR Act is in the nature of tax; b.
