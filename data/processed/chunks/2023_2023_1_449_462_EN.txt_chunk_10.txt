A the land for a purpose other than agriculture, would defeat the purpose of this Act. In the case of Ashok Madan and Another versus State of H.P. and Other9 the Himachal Pradesh High Court had laid down the following important observation with respect to Section 118 of the 1972 Act: B “12. The law is, therefore, clear that merely the nomenclature or the title of the document sill not determine what are the rights created by the document. The intention of the parties must be gathered on a combined reading of all the documents and the behaviour of the parties in the manner in which they treated the document. Section 118 was introduced with a view C to restrict the transfer of land in favour of non-agriculturist except to specified persons as contained in the Section itself. The purpose behind it was that the economically advantageous class does not take undue advantage of the small agriculturists by purchasing their small holdings. The provision was D introduced as rich persons who were not agriculturists were purchasing agricultural land in Himachal Pradesh at high price exploiting the local Himachali people. However, the section itself provided that in special cases permission can be granted for transfer of land to non-agriculturist. The constitutional validity of this Section was upheld in Smt. E Sudarshana Devi v. Union of India, ILR 1978 HP 355.” 19. Under the facts and circumstances of the case we do not find any scope for interference in the matter. Consequently, both the appeals stand dismissed. F Devika Gujral Appeals dismissed. (Assisted by : Shevali Monga, LCRA) G H 9 2011 SCC OnLine HP 3885
