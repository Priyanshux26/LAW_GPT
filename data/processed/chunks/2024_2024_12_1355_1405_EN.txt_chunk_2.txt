[Paras 6.1, 7, 8.11-8.15] Judicial deprecation – Marital dispute – Abuse of process of law – Criminal proceedings between spouses and their impact on marital ties: Held: Provisions in the criminal law are for the protection and empowerment of women but sometimes are used by certain women more for purposes that they are never meant for – In recent times, the invocation of ss.498A, 376, 377, 506 IPC as a combined package in most of the complaints related to matrimonial disputes is a practice condemned by this Court on several occasions – Wife and her family tend to use a criminal complaint with all the serious offences as a platform for negotiation and as a mechanism and a tool to get the husband and his family to comply with their demands, which are mostly monetary in nature – It is done in a fit of rage after a marital dispute, while at times it is a planned strategy in other cases – Unfortunately, it is not just the parties who are involved in this abuse of the process of law – Furthermore, Police personnel sometimes jump into action in selective cases and arrest the husband or even their relatives including aged and bedridden parents and grand-parents of the husband – Trial courts are hesitant in granting bail to the accused persons being swayed by the “gravity of the offences” mentioned in the FIR – Collective effect of this chain of events is often overlooked by the actual individual players involved, minor disputes between husband and wife tend to snowball into ugly prodigious battles of ego and reputation, eventually leading to the relationship turning sour to the extent that there remains no possibility of a reconciliation or cohabitation – Women to be careful about the fact that these strict provisions of law in their hands are beneficial legislations for their welfare and not means to chastise, threaten, domineer or extort from their husbands.
