It was further argued that the amount attached by the Income Tax Department was actually paid on 3rd August, 2020, from out of the earnest money deposited by the Auction Purchaser. While the Income Tax Department passed an lifting the attachment in respect of the subject property only on 27th August, 2020, the Auction Purchaser did not wait until then to pay the balance amount. The balance sale consideration was deposited by the Auction Purchaser through RTGS on 24th August, 2020, which was three days before the date the Income Tax Department passed the on 27th August, 2020. That being the position, the balance amount could have easily been paid by the Auction Purchaser in a similar manner (through RTGS) on or before 25th March, 2020, on the expiry of the period of 90 days, which it miserably failed to do. 42 [2022] 12 SCR 139 : (2022) 8 SCC 352 1284 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 27. Refuting the plea taken by the Auction Purchaser that under Section 281 of the IT Act, a sale shall be treated as void against any claim by the Income Tax Department which was a reason offered by it not to have paid the balance amount, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that such a plea is baseless inasmuch as the Auction Purchaser could have paid the balance amount by obtaining prior permission from the assessing officer. The Income Tax attachment did not stand in the way of payment of the balance sale consideration. A distinction was sought to be drawn between the expression ‘payment of sale consideration’ and ‘execution of sale deed’. The attention of the Court was also drawn to the letter dated 9th December, 2019 issued by the Liquidator to the Auction Purchaser in response to its communication dated 9th December, 2019 well before the date of auction, seeking a clarification. The Liquidator had clearly stated that the subject property was being sold under the IBC and the Income Tax Department could not have a priority in claim. In any case, the income tax dues were limited to a sum of ₹2,44,00,000/- crores (Rupees Two crore and forty four lakhs only) and the said amount could have been deposited with the Income Tax Department from out of the sale proceeds. It was on the basis of the aforesaid clarification furnished by the Liquidator that the Auction Purchaser had participated in the auction process and once having succeeded in the bid, it was under an obligation to deposit the balance sale consideration within 90 days from the date of the auction. 28. Questioning the stand taken by the respondents that Regulation 31A that requires constitution of a Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee by the Liquidator to advise on matters specified in the said Regulation, including sale of assets under Regulation 32, manner of sale, reserved price, amount of earnest money deposit, etc., was amended w.e.f. 25th July, 2019 and the Explanation in Regulation 31A made the said Regulation prospective, learned senior counsel for the appellant argued that the Liquidator could not have had the foresight to know that such an Explanation would be appended to Regulation 31A much later, vide Notification dated 28th April, 2022.
