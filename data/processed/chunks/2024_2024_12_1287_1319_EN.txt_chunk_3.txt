No. 3303 of 1997. 6 C.P No. 585 of Kamakshi Devi Rajneesh Goel i. dt. 21.11.2014 2024 in C.A. Avaru and ors. passed in I.A. No. 13 of No. 3306 of 2011 in C.A. No. 3303 of 1997 1997. ii. dt. 17.05.2022 in I.A. No. 98276 of 2021 in C.A. No. 3303 of 1997. The aforestated analogous petitions are taken up together and disposed of by this Common as they involve facts in common. 1.2 The petitioners in the aforestated contempt petitions have contended that the dated 21.11.2014 and 17.05.2022, including the dated 19.03.2024 is clear and explicit whereunder the respondent authorities have been directed by this Court to issue TDR as per TDR Rules in favour of the respective land owners whose land has been acquired for widening of Bellary and Jayamahal Roads and yet respondents have failed to do so and thereby they have wilfully disobeyed the directions and s passed by this Court. It is also contended that though Bengaluru Development Authority (for short BDA) and Bengaluru Bruhat Mahanagara Palike (for short BBMP) on the one hand were taking steps to issue TDR by calling for information from the petitioners, on the other hand Government of Karnataka passed an on 23.02.2021 expressing its difficulty to implement the s of this Court on the ground of financial hardship being caused to exchequer which itself is clear wilful disobedience. It is also contended that State has taken the benefit flowing from the dated 21.11.2014 and utilized the land owned by petitioners to widen the roads and has issued the Government dated 08.12.2022 after dismissal of the IA for modification on 17.05.2022, which amounts to over reaching the s of this Court. It is also contended that the positive direction issued by this Court to [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1293 Chaduranga Kanthraj Urs and Anr. v. P. Ravi Kumar and Ors. the respondents to issue TDR as per TDR rules in favour of complainants had not been complied which not only undermine the dignity of this Court but also the authority of this Court. It is further contended that market value determined for the subject land for issuing TDR by no stretch of imagination can be the market value prescribed under the provisions of Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, 1961 and the Karnataka Town and Country Planning (Benefit of Development Rights) Rules, 2016. It is also submitted that contemnors in the IA No.98276 of 2021 had filed for modification of the dated 21.11.2014 wherein they have clearly admitted that in the event of TDR is to be issued to the extent of 15 acres 39 guntas as per the s of this Court which is the extent of land acquired by the BBMP for widening of the roads, it would result in issuance of TDR valued at Rs.1,396 crores as per TDR rules and yet determined the value under the notices dated 10.06.2024 diametrically opposite to the stand already taken by them. Hence, contending that respondents are acting in violation of the s of this Court wilfully and as such they are liable to be proceeded with and punished for wilful disobedience of the dated 21.11.2014, 17.05.2022 and 19.03.2024.
