b. The report stated that the issue of unchecked immigration threatens to reduce the native Assamese population to a minority in the State of Assam. c. The Governor in his report was conscious of the fact that in the absence of any census being carried out to determine the number of illegal immigrants, precise and authentic figures regarding the same were not available.59 However, the Governor on the basis of estimates, extrapolations and various indicators indicated that the number of immigrants ran into millions. The Governor drew attention towards the speech of Mr. Indrajit Gupta, the then Home Minister of India, who, while making a speech in the Parliament on 06.05.1997, stated that there were ten million illegal immigrants residing in India.60 58 Governor of Assam Report to the President of India on Illegal Migration into Assam, D.O. No. GSAG.3/98, (Nov. 8, 1998). 59 Id. at para 13. 60 Id. at para 16. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1173 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 d. The report estimated the number of immigrants by considering the shortfall of population growth in Bangladesh. In 1970, the total population of East Pakistan was 75 million but in 1974 it had come down to 71.4 million. On the basis of 3.1 percent annual population growth rate during that period, the population of Bangladesh in 1974 should have been 77 million. The shortfall of about six million people could only be explained by large-scale immigration.61 83. The petitioners, placing reliance on a study titled “The Change of Religion and Language Composition in the State of Assam in Northeast India: A Statistical Analysis Since 1951 to 2001” 62 conducted by Dr. Bhupender Kumar Nath and Prof. Dilip Nath, submitted that the districts bing Bangladesh witnessed a significantly high growth of Bengali speakers post partition. The study indicated that from 1951 to 2011, the percentage of Bengali speaking population in Assam increased by 36.36% (from 21.2% to 28.91% of the total population of Assam), but during this period the proportion of Assamese speaking people in the State had declined by 30.18% i.e. (from 69.3% to 48.38% of the total population of Assam). However, rest of the districts did not experience a substantial change in linguistic composition. As far as the other languages are concerned, no major change was seen for Hindi, Nepali and other language groups.63 Dr. Bhupender Nath, while relying on the empirical analysis based on district-level census data, concluded that the proportion of Bengali-speaking and Muslim population rapidly rose between 1951-2001, more than any other religion and language.64 The same stands true as per the data available from the 2011 census as well. As per Dr. Nath, this unusually high growth could not be attributed to natural increase, and thus, could only be attributed to the influx of Bangladeshi immigrants into Assam. This could adversely affect the future of the Assamese language given the rate at which the immigration has been regularized.65 61 Id. at para 18(c). 62 Dr. Bhupendra Nath & Dilip C Nath, The Change of Religion and Language Composition in the State of Assam in Northeast India: A Statistical Analysis Since 1951 to 2001, 5 int.
