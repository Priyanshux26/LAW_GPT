17 (2) Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled Tribes specifi ed in a notifi cation issued under clause ( 1 ) any tribe or tribal community or part of or group within any tribe or tribal community...” 18 Offi cial Liquidator vs Dharti Dhan, AIR 1977 SC 740. 110 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. Section 9, RP Act and Section 11, Delimitation Act 71. The petitioners have adverted to these provisions, as an alternative route to incorporate the mandate of Articles 332 into the 2006 Notifi cation and 2008 . They seek a mandamus against the Election Commission generally in accordance with Article 332 for the Sikkim State Legislative Assembly, on the strength of Section 9of the RP Act and Section 11of the Delimitation Act. 72. Section 11 deals with the power of the Election Commission to maintain delimitation s up to date while Section 9 deals with the same power specifi cally in respect of the Delimitation 2008. The salient aspects of these provisions are: • Both the Sections use the word “may” in delineating the power of the Election Commission; • Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of each of the provisions pertains to correction of printing mistakes in the s generally and in the 2008 respectively, or any “error arising therein from inadvertent slip or omission”; and • Clause (b) of sub-section (1) deals with necessary amendments on account of alteration in the boundaries or names. 73. We have already addressed Section 9(1)(aa). The only other relevant clause for our purpose is clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 11of the Delimitation Act and Section 9 of the RP Act. Clause (a) deals with – fi rst, correction of printing mistakes in s or the 2008 respectively and second, correction of “any error arising therein from an inadvertent slip or omission”. 74. The invocation of this clause can take place only if we were to fi nd the non-inclusion of the Limboo Tamang Scheduled Tribes in the 2006 Notifi cation and 2008 as an “error” arising out of an inadvertent slip or omission. However, the non-inclusion of these Scheduled Tribes in the two s is attributable to the fact that the Constitution itself mandates the delimitation exercise to be carried out in accordance with the fi gures of the 2001 census alone and that the subsequent changes to the ST have not been accordingly assimilated with the 2001 fi gures. Consequently, PUBLIC INTEREST COMMITTEE FOR SCHEDULING SPECIFIC 1107 AREAS v. UOI [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] the delimitation exercise undertaken in 2006 could not account for the Amending Act of 2002. This was the specifi c issue that the Court addressed in Virendra Pratap (supra) by stating that the Election Commission may obtain the relevant fi gures that were de hors the 2001 census. 75. Thus, the non-inclusion of the Limboo Tamang STs is not attributable to a mere error arising out of an inadvertent slip or omission- which are the only grounds under which the s can be altered by the Delimitation Commission or the Election Commission.
