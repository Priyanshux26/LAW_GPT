The employer is required to prominently post the Certifi ed Standing s on special boards maintained for that purpose. This is the broad scheme of the Act. The Act also provides for exemptions. About that, later. The Act, as originally enacted, precluded the Certifying Offi cer from adjudicating upon the fairness or reasonableness of the Draft Standing s submitted by the employer but an amendment introduced in 1956 now casts a duty upon the Certifying Offi cer to adjudicate upon the fairness or reasonableness of the draft Standing s. The scheme of the Act UNION OF INDIA & ORS. v. K. SURI BABU 1059 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] has been suffi ciently explained by this Court in Associated Cement Co. Ltd. v. P.D. Vyas [AIR 1960 SC 665 : (1960) 2 SCR 974 : (1960) 1 LLJ 563 : 20 FJR 59] , Rohtak Hissar District Electricity Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P. [AIR 1966 SC 1471 : (1966) 2 SCR 863 : (1966) 2 LLJ 330 : 29 FJR 76] , and Western India Match Co. Ltd. v. Workmen [(1974) 3 SCC 330 : 1973 SCC (L&S) 531 : (1974) 1 SCR 434] .

We have already shown that the Industrial Employment (Standing s) Act is a special Act dealing with a specifi c subject, namely the conditions of service, enumerated in the schedule, of workmen in industrial establishments. It is impossible to conceive that Parliament sought to abrogate the provisions of the Industrial Employment (Standing s) Act embodying as they do hard-won and precious rights of workmen and prescribing as they do an elaborate procedure, including a quasi-judicial determination, by a general, incidental provision like Section 79(c) of the Electricity (Supply) Act. It is obvious that Parliament did not have before it the Standing s Act when it passed the Electricity Supply Act and Parliament never meant that the Standing s Act should stand pro tanto repealed by Section 79(c) of the Electricity Supply Act. We are clearly of the view that 106 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R.
