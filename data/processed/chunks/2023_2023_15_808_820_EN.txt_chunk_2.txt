The Enquiry Offi cer in the departmental proceeding found the charges proved and the Disciplinary Authority, by an of 31.03.2004, dismissed the appellant from service. The Appellate Authority also dismissed the appeal. Attempts to have the reviewed and the penalty reconsidered were also in vain. 6. At the criminal trial, the trial Court convicted the appellant for the off ence under Section 420 of the IPC and sentenced him to undergo three years’ imprisonment along-with a fi ne of Rs.5,000/-. However, the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Jodhpur [‘Appellate Judge’], vide dated 24.08.2007, allowed the criminal appeal and acquitted the appellant. 812 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 7. The appellant, thereafter, represented for his reinstatement. Subsequently, he fi led a writ petition in August, 2008 for quashing the dismissal dated 31.03.2004, the of the Appellate Authority, and the s refusing to review and reconsider the above-said s. 8. The learned Single Judge, by his dated 13.08.2008, dismissed the writ petition by holding that the standard of proof in a criminal proceeding and departmental proceeding is diff erent. The learned Single Judge found no infi rmity in the of the Disciplinary Authority. The writ appeal fi led by the appellant has also been dismissed by reiterating the fi ndings of the learned Single Judge and by further elucidating as to how the parameters for a judicial review against an in a departmental proceeding are limited and circumscribed. Being aggrieved, the appellant is in appeal before us. Questions for consideration: 9. The following two questions arise for consideration: a) Whether the dismissal of the appellant from service pursuant to the departmental enquiry was justifi ed? b) On the facts of the case, what is the eff ect of the acquittal, ed by the Appellate Judge in the criminal trial, on the of dismissal passed in the departmental enquiry? 10. We have heard Mr. Adarsh Priyadarshi, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. Vishal Meghwal, learned counsel for the State. Learned counsels have reiterated their contentions before the Courts below. Legal Position: 11. We have examined both the questions independently. We are conscious of the fact that a writ court’s power to review the of the Disciplinary Authority is very limited. The scope of enquiry is only to examine whether the decision-making process is legitimate. [See State Bank of India vs. A.G.D. Reddy, 2023:INSC:766 = 2023 (11) Scale 530]. As part of that exercise, the courts exercising power of judicial review are entitled to consider whether the fi ndings of the Disciplinary Authority have ignored material evidence and if it so fi nds, courts are not powerless to interfere. [See United Bank of India vs. Biswanath Bhattacharjee, 2022:INSC:117 = (2022) 13 SCC 329] RAM LAL V. STATE OF RAJASTHAN & ORS. 813 12. We are also conscious of the fact that mere acquittal by a criminal court will not confer on the employee a right to claim any benefi t, including reinstatement. (See Deputy Inspector General of Police and Another v. S. Samuthiram, (2013) 1 SCC 598).
