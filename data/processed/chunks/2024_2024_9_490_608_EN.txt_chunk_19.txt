To be noted, this dichotomy is not a mere erroneous application of law, and it needs no reappreciation of evidence. It is also an infract of section 18 of A and C Act which provides for equal treatment of parties. More importantly, the law of limitation being based on public policy, as already delineated supra, infract of the same would clearly vitiate the impugned award as one being in conflict with public policy of India.” 21. The learned Single Judge thereafter proceeded to observe that the counterclaim and heads of claim were so intertwined with each other that a decision on one, with no decision on the other, would vitiate the entire award. Further, it was observed, if the arbitral tribunal had taken the date of joint meeting (i.e., 19 April 2018), and the follow up offer dated 26 May 2018, as the starting point of limitation for the claim, the same would be the starting point of limitation for the counterclaim as well. And if the starting point of limitation is taken as 21 September 2015 (i.e., the date of completion of the work), the claim, which was filed on 2 May 2019, was well beyond three years and as such barred by limitation. Thus, according to the learned Single 518 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Judge there was inherent contradiction in the arbitral award which made it vulnerable to a challenge under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. Consequently, the learned Single Judge set aside the arbitral award. 22. Aggrieved by the and of the learned Single Judge, dated 23 December 2020, Enexio (R-1 herein) filed two appeals, namely, O.S.A. (CAD) Nos. 174 and 175 of 2021, before the Division Bench of the High Court, which came to be allowed by the impugned . IMPUGNED 23. The Division Bench of the High Court, inter alia, took the view that the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018, read with e-mail dated 26 May 2018, amounted to an acknowledgment of the dues payable to Enexio, thereby satisfying the ingredients of Section 18 of the 1963 Act for a fresh period of limitation to run from that date. It observed that when the last part of the minutes’ dated 19 April 2018 is read with subsequent communication dated 26 May 2018, it belies the stand of the counterclaimant that the counterclaims were admitted to the claimant. Thus, the Division Bench, inter alia, held that the view taken by the arbitral tribunal was a possible view and there was no patent illegality in the award meriting interference under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. Consequently, the of the learned Single Judge was set aside, and the arbitral award was restored. 24. We have heard Mr. Abhimanyu Bhandari for the appellants; Mr. Gaurab Banerjee for the claimant-respondent and have perused the record. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT(S) 25. The learned counsel for the appellants, inter alia, submitted: (i) The Arbitral Tribunal, in paragraph 16.03(d) of the award qua claims (i), (iv), (v) and (vi) (corresponding claim numbers A, D, E and F) of the claimant-respondent, observed: “As long as meaningful negotiations were ongoing between the parties, the period of limitation of three years had not begun to run.
