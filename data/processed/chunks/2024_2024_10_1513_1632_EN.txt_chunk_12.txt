Child marriage has been on a steady decline in India. The prevalence of child marriages in India has halved since the enactment of the PCMA in 2006 from 47% to 27% in 2015-16 and 23.3% in 2019-2021.13 The decline in child marriage in India is in line with the global trend. In the past decade, the proportion of girls married as children has dropped by 15%.14 Despite these enormous strides globally and in India, no region in the world is on track to attain the SDG-5 target.15 It is estimated that the progress in reducing child marriage would need to be twelve times faster than the rate observed in the past decade to achieve the SDG-5 target.16 6 United Nations (2015).

A child implies a person whose capacity to make legal decisions is not fully developed. On the other hand, marriage is an institution with legal standing. The law seeks to govern the legitimacy of sexual activity and marriage is the institution in which it is legitimised. Marriage dictates the framework rules of permissible and impermissible social behaviours. However, a child is incapable of understanding the broad and serious obligations expected from members of a marital union. Child marriage often deprives children of intellectual, social and psychological development and carries life-threatening risks. It therefore comes as a great tragedy that the term child marriage is normalised to a point where this blatant paradox is lost on most people. II. Procedural history and submissions 6.
