On the other hand, it was contended by the Municipal Corporation that Regulation 33 was not brought to the notice of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I and that by notification dated 16.11.2016 the Regulation was amended to restrict the benefit of additional TDR for development of amenities which was to cure a defect in the legislation. The said contention was considered in light of the amendment to Regulation 33 with effect from 17.06.2010, by which a clause was added to sub-regulation (1) and it was observed that the amendment to Regulation 33(1) was applicable to roads and not to any other amenity. Moreover, this portion of the amendment would not apply where the FSI granted in lieu of road is utilised and full occupation certificate was granted prior to 17.06.2010. Therefore, from 17.06.2010 in case of a [2024] 9 S.C.R. 847 Kukreja Construction Company & Others v. State of Maharashtra & Others land reserved for road or road widening which was surrendered, if the amenity of the road was constructed by the owner of the land surrendered, the additional FSI as provided in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 126 will be 25% from the area of the construction of the road. Therefore, for such amenity, in terms of Para 6 of Appendix-VII, the owner or a lessee will not get TDR equivalent to entire area of the road constructed by him. It will remain confined to 25% of the area. It was observed that Regulation 33(1) as amended on 17.06.2010 was not modified by the impugned notification dated 16.11.2016. Apurva Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd.: 6. In the case of Apurva Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra, Writ Petition No.203 of 2014 filed before the High Court, the surrender of land was in the form of deed of conveyance and handing over of possession was in February, 2007 and within three years from the surrender i.e. February, 2010, the writ petitioner/appellant herein requested an officer of MMRDA to recommend to the Mumbai Municipal Corporation to issue 100% additional TDR in respect of construction of amenity. In December, 2010, DRC of 25% of the amenity was granted. The balance 75% had not been paid. Hence, the writ petition was filed in October, 2013. Actually, within one month from the date of decision in the case of Godrej and Boyce I, the petitioner applied to the respondent-MMRDA for recommending to the Mumbai Municipal Corporation for grant of 100% TDR in respect of the amenity and the said application was acted upon and 25% FSI was granted in December, 2010. Therefore, the High Court held that conduct of the petitioner is not such that it will prevent the Writ Court from granting relief in terms of the decision in Godrej & Boyce I. Arvind Kashinath Dadarkar: 7.
