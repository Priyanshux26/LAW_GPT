64. We would only reiterate that the proviso creates a fi ne balance between individual liberty and adequate investigation. The time limit fi xed would help an accused person to come out of incarceration and thereafter lead to the faster conclusion of the trial, it also facilitates a proper investigation by way of police custody. 65. It is to protect the interest of an accused person by restricting the period of investigation, a failure of which would entitle an arrestee to be released. This again is yet another facet of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950. In Satender Kumar Antil (supra): “39. Section 167(2) was introduced in the year 1978, giving emphasis to the maximum period of time to complete the investigation. This provision has got a laudable object behind it, which is to ensure an expeditious investigation and a fair trial, and to set down a rationalised procedure that protects the interests of the indigent sections of society. This is also another limb of Article 21. Presumption of innocence is also inbuilt in this provision. An investigating agency has to expedite the process of investigation as a suspect is languishing under incarceration. Thus, a duty is enjoined upon the agency to complete the investigation within the time prescribed and a failure would enable the release of the accused. The right enshrined is an absolute and indefeasible one, inuring to the benefi t of suspect. 40. Such a right cannot be taken away even during any unforeseen circumstances, such as the recent pandemic, as held by this Court in M. Ravindran v. Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, (2021) 2 SCC 485 : (2021) 1 SCC (Cri) 876 : (SCC pp. 502-06, para 17) “II. Section 167(2) and the Fundamental Right to Life and Personal Liberty 17. Before we proceed to expand upon the parameters of the right to default bail under Section 167(2) as interpreted by various decisions 906 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. of this Court, we fi nd it pertinent to note the observations made by this Court in Uday Mohanlal Acharya v. State of Maharashtra, (2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760 on the fundamental right to personal liberty of the person and the eff ect of deprivation of the same as follows : (SCC p. 472, para 13) ‘13. … Personal liberty is one of the cherished objects of the Indian Constitution and deprivation of the same can only be in accordance with law and in conformity with the provisions thereof, as stipulated under Article 21 of the Constitution. When the law provides that the Magistrate could authorise the detention of the accused in custody up to a maximum period as indicated in the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167, any further detention beyond the period without fi ling of a challan by the investigating agency would be a subterfuge and would not be in accordance with law and in conformity with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, and as such, could be violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.’ 17.1.
