24. The 1926 Act did not prescribe any qualifications to be possessed by persons applying for admission as advocates. Under the 1926 Act, the Bar Councils prescribed qualifications, but the enrollment was carried out by the High Courts. Under the Advocates Act, the enrolment process is completely undertaken by the SBCs. The SBCs are mandated to maintain and prepare a State roll and admit persons as advocates on the roll if they fulfil the statutory prescriptions, along with any other qualifications laid down by the SBCs. Section 24(1) of the Advocates Act statutorily engrafts the minimum qualifications to be possessed by advocates seeking enrolment. The provision specifies the qualifications to be possessed by persons to be admitted as an advocate on a State roll. Additionally, the SBCs can also specify other conditions by rules. 30 Bar Council of U P (supra) [14] 1512 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 25. Section 24A provides that no person shall be admitted on a State roll if he is: (i) convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude; (ii) convicted of an offence under the provisions of the Untouchability (Offences) Act 1955; and (iii) dismissed or removed from employment or office under State on any charge involving moral turpitude. Section 25 provides that an application for admission as an advocate shall be made to the SBC within whose jurisdiction the applicant proposes to practice. Section 26 mandates the SBCs to refer every application for admission to their enrolment committee for decision. The SBCs are also empowered to remove the names of advocates from the State roll.31 Section 28 empowers the SBCs to make rules for the admission and enrolment of advocates. 26. The provisions of the Advocates Act indicate that it provides a complete machinery32 to deal with the admission and enrolment of advocates. The SBCs are vested with sufficient powers to ensure effectual and complete implementation of the enactment. In Dr Haniraj L Chulani v. Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa, this Court held that the Advocates Act provides a complete code for regulating the legal education and professional qualifications of an aspirant seeking entry into the legal profession.33 iii. Delegated legislation 27. The basic principle underlying the concept of delegated legislation is that the legislature cannot directly exert its will in every detail.34 It lays down the legislative policy and delegates the subsidiary or ancillary powers to the delegated or subordinate authorities to carry out the legislative policy.35 It is now a settled legal principle that the legislature cannot abdicate essential legislative functions to the delegated authority.36 The legislature can entrust subsidiary or ancillary legislation to the delegate. Before such delegation, the legislature should enunciate the policy and the principles for the 31 Section 26A, Advocates Act 32 See Girnar Traders v.
