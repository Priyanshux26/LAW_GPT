The Trial Court taking cognizance of the off ence, framed two charges. Charge against the accused Nos.1 to 3 was under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC. Charge was against the accused no.3 under Section 307 IPC. 2.7 The trial involved the examination of 14 witnesses, and the presentation of 18 documents and 9 material objects. While the accused nos.2 and 3 were acquitted due to lack of conclusive evidence against them, the accused no.1, i.e., the appellant herein was found guilty based on the weight of the testimonies and other documentary and material evidence. According to the Trial Court there was compelling evidence, particularly the recovery of the murder weapon and the consistency of the eyewitness testimonies, which duly proved the conviction of the appellant. 3. As already narrated earlier, by dated 05.10.2012, the Trial Court convicted the accused no.1, i.e., the appellant herein under Section 302 IPC and acquitted accused Nos.2 and 3 from all the charges levelled against them.

The appellant fi led Criminal Appeal No.151 of 2013 before the High Court at Madras. Vide dt. 22.04.2016, the High Court upheld the Trial Court’s and dismissed the appeal of the appellant concluding that the act of the appellant would squarely fall within the third limb of Section 300 IPC and the same would not fall under any of the Exception to Section 300 IPC and hence he is liable to be punished under Section 302 of IPC. 5. The appellant has fi led the present appeal against the aforementioned of the High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 151 of 2013 praying to set aside the of conviction on several grounds, inter alia, that the Trial Court held that accused no.1, all of a sudden, while the wordy quarrel 107 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. was going on, had stabbed the deceased in front of his daughter, son, his relatives and hence his act should come under Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC and would be guilty of Section 304 part 1 IPC and should be sentenced accordingly. 6. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent-State supported the s and s passed by the Trial Court and the High Court, opposing the arguments of the appellant. 7. Having heard the arguments of both the parties, we fi nd that the evidence presented before the Trial Court and the facts and circumstances of the case clearly establish beyond reasonable doubt that the wound caused by the appellant was the reason for the death of the deceased. The High Court also reaffi rmed this observation that the injuries with soori-knife caused by the appellant were the reason for the death of the deceased.
