PC which would reveal the position that once a warrant is issued it would remain in force until it 5 2004 SCC OnLine Guj 345 434 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports is cancelled by the Court which issued it or until its execution. There is no case for the appellants that either of such events had occurred in this case to make the warrants unenforceable. They also got no case that their application was interfered with by a higher Court. That apart, it is a fact that the appellants themselves on 23.08.2022, moved a bail-cum-surrender application before the Trial Court but withdrew the same fearing arrest. It is also relevant to note that in the case on hand even while contending that they were before a Court, the appellants got no case that in terms of the provisions under Section 438 (1-B), Cr. PC an for their presence before the Court was ed either suo motu by the Court or on an application by the public prosecutor. When that be the circumstance, the appellants cannot be allowed to contend that they were not hiding or concealing themselves from arrest or that they were not knowing that they were wanted in a Court of law. 21. To understand and consider another contention of the appellants it is worthy to extract ground No.3 raised by the appellants in SLP which reads thus: “III. Because the Hon’ble High Court has failed to appreciate that proclamation under section 82 Cr.P.C. was issued on 04.01.2023 by the Ld. Trial Court and thereafter process under section 83 Cr.P.C. have been initiated on 15.03.2023 whereas the application for anticipatory bail by the petitioner before the Hon’ble High Court was filed in November, 2022, however, the same was came for hearing on 04.04.2023. It is, therefore, evident that when the petitioners preferred filing of anticipatory bail before the Hon’ble High Court then none of the petitioner was declared absconder and process under section 82/83 Cr.P.C. were not initiated against them.” 22. The above extracted ground taken by the appellant constrains us to consider the question whether there could be any bar on the Trial Court for proceeding under Section 82 Cr.PC, merely because an anticipatory application for bail has been filed or because such an application was adjourned without passing any interim . We may hasten to add here that it is always preferable to pass s, either way, at the earliest. In the case on hand, application for anticipatory bail was filed by the appellants before the High Court in November, 2022 and brought up for hearing on 04.04.2023, on which day it was [2024] 3 S.C.R. 435 Srikant Upadhyay & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Anr. dismissed as per the impugned . The very ground, extracted above, would reveal that in the meanwhile, proclamation under Section 82 Cr.PC, was issued on 04.01.2023 and thereafter process under Section 83 Cr.PC was initiated on 15.03.2023. 23. There can be no room for raising a contention that when an application is filed for anticipatory bail, it cannot be adjourned without passing an of interim protection.
