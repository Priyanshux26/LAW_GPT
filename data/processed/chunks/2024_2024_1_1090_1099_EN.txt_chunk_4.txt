SUPREME COURT REPORT: DIGITAL not organized by the Society itself, and such acts on its part amounted to willful and deliberate violation of the dated 03.03.2010 passed in the first appeal. The Division Bench also took note of the fact that the application filed by the Society seeking leave to let out a portion of the suit premises had already been rejected. As the execution proceedings initiated by the Trust, the decree holder, stood stayed by virtue of the dated 03.03.2010, the Division Bench opined that justice would be subserved by vacating the said of stay of execution proceedings without initiating a proceeding for contempt. The Bench accordingly allowed C.P.A.N.2113 of 2013 and vacated the of stay granted in F.A. No. 229 of 2009. The Bench held that the decree would be executable at once, subject to the result of the pending appeal. 11. The appellant before us, viz., the contemnor, would contend that it was not open to the High Court to vacate the stay passed in the appeal in exercise of contempt jurisdiction. He would point out that no steps were taken by the Trust to seek such relief in the appeal and the High Court ought not to have resorted to such action in the contempt case. 12. On the contrary, the Trust would argue that the impugned does not warrant interference at this stage as the of stay dated 03.03.2010 in the appeal stood vacated automatically in terms of clause 7 thereof, as there was a default in the making of deposits as directed in the earlier clauses. It would point out that the Society was required to deposit a sum of ₹10 lakh with the Registrar General of the High Court within the stipulated time but such deposit was made only on 22.12.2010, well after the expiry thereof. It would also point out that the Society was required to deposit occupation charges @ ₹35,000/- per month during the pendency of the appeal and assert that the Society stopped making such deposits since February, 2020. It is however admitted by the Trust that no steps were taken to revive the execution proceedings on these grounds. 13. Now, a look at caselaw on the point. In Sudhir Vasudeva vs. M.George Ravishekaran1, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court observed as under, in the context of exercise of contempt jurisdiction: - 1 [2014] 4 SCR 27 : (2014) 3 SCC 373 [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1097 Amit Kumar Das, Joint Secretary, Baitanik, A Registered Society v. Shrimati Hutheesingh Tagore Charitable Trust “19. The power vested in the High Courts as well as this Court to punish for contempt is a special and rare power available both under the Constitution as well as the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.…… The very nature of the power casts a sacred duty in the Courts to exercise the same with the greatest of care and caution. This is also necessary as, more often than not, adjudication of a contempt plea involves a process of self-determination of the sweep, meaning and effect of the in respect of which disobedience is alleged.
