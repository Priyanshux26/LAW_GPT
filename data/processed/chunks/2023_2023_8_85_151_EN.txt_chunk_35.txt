In our view, the decision in the said has been given in the facts of the case and does not have any binding effect in case of the projects regulated by this Commission. Moreover, the SHR given in the bid are under test conditions and may vary from actual SHR. The Commission after extensive stakeholders consultation has E specified the SHR norms in the 2014 Tariff Regulations. Therefore, it would be appropriate to take SHR specified in the Regulations as a reference point instead of other parameters as suggested by MSEDCL. 31. In the present case, the Petitioner has considered SHR of F 2355 kcal/Kwh whereas, the Respondent MSEDCL has considered the Design Heat Rate of 2211 kcal/kWh as submitted in the RFP. It is pertinent to mention that the CERC norms applicable for the period 2009-14 and 2014-19 do not provide the norms for 300 MW units, but provide for a degradation factor of G 6.5% and 4.5% respectively towards Heat Rate over and above the Design Heat Rate. As the Design Heat Rate is 2211 kcal/ kWh, the gross Heat Rate works out to 2355 kcal/kWh (2211 x 1.065)and 2310 kcal/kWh (2211 x 1.045) for the period 2009- 14 and 2014-19 respectively. Accordingly, we direct that the SHR of 2355 kcal/kWh during the period 2009-14 and 2310 kcal/kwh during H MAHARASHTRA STATE ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION CO. LTD. v. 135 ADANI POWER MAHARASHTRA LTD. [B. R. GAVAI, J.] the period 2014- 19 or the actual SHR whichever is lower, shall A be considered for calculating the coal consumption for the purpose of compensation under change in law. The Petitioner and the Respondent MSEDCL are directed to carry out reconciliation on account of these claims annually. 32. In case of GCV, the Respondent has submitted that it should B be mid value of GCV band which should be applied on GCV measured on ‘as billed’ basis. In our view, on account of the grade slippage of the coal supplied by CIL, it would not be appropriate to consider GCV on ‘as billed’ basis. In the 2014 Tariff Regulations of the Commission, the measurement of GCV has been specified C as on ‘as received’ basis. Therefore, it will be appropriate if the GCV on ‘as received’ basis is considered for computation of compensation for Change in law.” 106. The CERC has referred to the of the learned APTEL dated 12th September 2014 in Appeal No. 288 of 2013 in the D case of M/s Wardha Power Company Limited v. Reliance Infrastructure Limited & anr. wherein the learned APTEL has held that it is not correct to co-relate the compensation on account of Change in Law due to change in cess/excise duty on coal to the coal price computed from the quoted energy charges in the financial bid and the heat rate and GCV of coal given in the bidding documents by the bidder E for the purpose of establishing the coal requirement. The learned APTEL has held that the coal price so calculated will not be equal to the actual price of coal and therefore, compensation for Change in Law computed on such price of coal will not restore the economic position of the seller to the same level as if such Change in Law had not occurred.
