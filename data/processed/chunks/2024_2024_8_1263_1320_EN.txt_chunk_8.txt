It was further submitted that the passed by the this Court and relied on by the Auction Purchaser in GPR Power Solutions Pvt. Ltd. v. Supriyo Chaudhuri,19 as also the dated 02nd March, 2020 and the dated 12th May, 2020 passed in Civil Appeal No. 1902 of 2020,20 could not have enured to its benefit for the reason that the said s applied to filing of petitions, applications, suits, appeals 17 [2013] 4 SCR 1 : (2013) 9 SCC 460 18 [1980] 1 SCR 1177 : (1980) 1 SCC 403 19 (2021) 17 SCC 312 20 Union Bank of India v. Rajat Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. and Others [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1275 V.S. Palanivel v. P. Sriram, CS, Liquidator, Etc. or other proceedings within the prescribed period of limitation. Citing the decision in Sagufa Ahmed v. Upper Assam Polywood Products Pvt. Ltd.21 learned senior counsel submitted that the passed by this Court on 23rd March, 2020 in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3/2020, was only intended for the benefit of vigilant litigants who were prevented from initiating proceedings within the period of limitation due to the pandemic and the lockdown. The Auction Purchaser was not a litigant before the Court and could not have availed of the said . The Auction Purchaser was neither required to approach the Adjudicating Authority, nor to file any petition before the Tribunal for remitting the balance sale consideration. 12. It was next canvassed on behalf of the appellant that the of attachment by the Income Tax Authorities in respect of the auctioned property is an irrelevant consideration insofar as it relates to deposit of the balance sale consideration by the Auction Purchaser within 90 days. Alluding to the terms and conditions of the auction, learned counsel argued that the e-auction was conducted on an ‘As Is Where Is’ basis and clause 12 of the said Notice of auction clearly stated that the sale would be subject to the IBC and the IBBI Regulations, 2016. Therefore, the Auction Purchaser cannot be heard to state that it was unaware of the Income Tax attachment . Having bid for the subject property and agreed to the condition that the balance sale amount had to be deposited within 90 days, the Auction Purchaser was under an obligation to comply with the terms of the auction and on failure to do so, the Liquidator ought to have cancelled the sale instead of accommodating the Auction Purchaser. 13. Lastly, learned counsel submitted that even assuming that the last date for making the payment towards the balance sale consideration was 25th March, 2020, as was urged by the other side, the period of limitation would have recommenced on 23rd July, 2020, since the Liquidator had moved an application22 seeking exclusion of the period between 23rd March, 2020 and 23rd July, 2020. In view of the above, there was no justification for the Auction Purchaser to have made the payment on 24th August, 2020 i.e. after a period of one month reckoned from the date when the exclusion period had ended.
