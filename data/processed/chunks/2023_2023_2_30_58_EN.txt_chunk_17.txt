It is B rather ironical that the irregularities noticed by the respondents in the Inspection Report dated 20th April, 2018, that made them withhold the vigilance clearance of the appellant were to their knowledge ten days before and yet they had issued a letter dated 11th April, 2018, giving him vigilance clearance. C 34. It is noteworthy that the appellant had challenged the proceedings initiated against him by the respondents on the basis of the inspections conducted on 29th and 30th November, 2017 in OA No.77 of 2018. In the said proceedings, the Tribunal had passed an interim on 2nd February, 2018 directing that the said proceedings will not come in the way of promotion, appointment and deputation prospects of the D appellant. Regardless of the above directions, the respondents not only denied vigilance clearance to the appellant on 20th April, 2018 they went a step ahead and proceeded to place his name in the “Agreed List” i.e., the list of suspected officers. This act of the respondents was also assailed by the appellant before the Tribunal in O.A. No. 279 of 2018. Ultimately, E both the captioned Original Applications were collectively decided by the Tribunal in favour of the appellant by a detailed judgement dated 6th March, 201, which has not been stayed by any superior Court. 35. Aggrieved by a separate Memo dated 30th January 2018 issued by the respondents on the basis of the aforesaid inspection of his office F conducted on 29th and 30th November, 2017 calling for his explanation in respect of some s passed by him in his judicial/quasi-judicial capacity as Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemption), the appellant had to file O.A. No.332 of 2018 that was decided by the Tribunal in his favour vide dated 28th May, 2019. In its , the Tribunal relied on the dated 15th May 2018, passed by the High Court in W.P. No.13390 G of 2018 (SB), declaring that the inspection conducted by the Department was without jurisdiction and that there was no justification for withholding the vigilance clearance of the appellant on the basis of the said inspection. Noting that the Memo dated 30th January 2018 issued by the respondents calling for an explanation from the appellant was premised on the very H 56 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A same inspection conducted by the Department, the Tribunal reiterated the string of findings returned by it in favour of the appellant in its earlier common dated 6th March 2019 [passed in O.A. No. 137 of 2018 and O.A. No. 279 of 2018] and proceeded to quash the Memo dated 30th January 2018 issued by the respondents. It was further held that the said will not adversely impact forwarding of the name of B the appellant as Member, ITAT, in terms of the recommendations made by the Selection Committee in its meeting held on 26th August 2018. 36. In the teeth of the series of s passed by the Tribunal and the High Court in favour of the appellant, the respondents elected to withhold his vigilance clearance, thereby compelling the appellant to file C contempt petitions against the concerned officers for non-compliance of the s passed.
