Subsequently, the FSA was amended and the quantum of coal assured by WCL was transferred to SECL. 12. It is also not in dispute that subsequently, on 21st June 2013, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (“CCEA” for short), in view of the persistent shortage of domestic coal, approved a revised mechanism for coal supply to power producers. H 92 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 13. Thereafter, the Government of India, through the Ministry of Coal, issued Office Memorandum dated 26th July 2013 (hereinafter referred to as “NCDP 2013”), thereby approving a revised arrangement for the supply of coal to the identified Thermal Power Stations (“TPPs” for short). The said Office Memorandum provided that FSAs will be signed for the domestic coal quantity of 65%, 65%, 67%, and 75% of B Annual Contracted Quantity (“ACQ” for short) for the remaining four years of the 12th Plan for the power plants having normal coal linkages. It further provided that to meet the balance FSA obligations towards the requirement of the said 78,000 MW TPPs, CIL may import coal and supply the same to the willing power plants on a cost-plus basis. It further C provided that the power plants may also directly import coal themselves, if they so opt, in which case, the FSA obligations on the part of CIL to the extent of import component would be deemed to have been discharged. 14. On 31st July 2013, the MoP issued a letter to the Central D Electricity Regulatory Commission (“CERC” for short) and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions to consider as pass-through in tariff the cost of alternate coal (procured to meet the shortfall in supply of domestic linkage coal) on a case to case basis. 15. Contending that on account of the Change in Law, APML E was entitled to compensation, APML filed a Petition bearing Case No.189 of 2013 on 17th December 2013 before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (“MERC” for short). 16. MERC, vide dated 15th July 2014, disposed the said Petition (i.e. Case No. 189 of 2013) by approving a framework for determination of compensatory fuel charge, in view of the CCEA decision F of 21st June 2013 and the MoP’s advice dated 31st July 2013. 17. In compliance with the MERC’s dated 15th July 2014, APML filed another Petition before the MERC bearing Case No. 140 of 2014 on 23rd July 2014, inter alia, for approving a mechanism for the determination of compensatory tariff. G 18. The MERC, vide its dated 20th August 2014, formulated a mechanism for the pass-through in tariff of the compensatory fuel charge that had been allowed in Case No.189 of 2013. 19. Subsequently, APML filed a Review Petition before the MERC H bearing Case No.159 of 2014. The same was disallowed by the MERC MAHARASHTRA STATE ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION CO. LTD. v. 93 ADANI POWER MAHARASHTRA LTD. [B. R. GAVAI, J.] as being devoid of merits except on the issue of the effectiveness of the A compensatory fuel charge. 20.
