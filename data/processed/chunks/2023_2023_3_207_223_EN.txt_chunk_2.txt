D The appellants before us are from the feeder cadre. There have been several rounds of litigations in the past as regards formulation of the seniority position and the which is under appeal before us, delivered by a Division of the High Court of judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench on 22nd July 2014 has in substance, sustained the seniority list of 25th October 2013. The appellants have taken out an E application (I.A. No. 163147 of 2021) for deletion of proforma respondent nos. 20 and 21. Respondent no. 21 has passed away on 7thJuly 2017. So far as the said respondent is concerned, the appeal has abated as against him. It has been pleaded in this application that the Registry has informed that there is no evidence of dasti services on the said two respondents. F In the office report of 15th December 2015 (annexed as A1 to the application), it has however been recorded that service of show-cause notice is complete with respect to respondent no. 20. This has been followed by the of the Court of Registrar dated 6th August 2018 (annexed as A3 to the application), in which also it has been recorded that the respondents have been duly served/represented. But no report G to that effect is available on records. In such circumstances, learned counsel for the appellants has not pressed this application before us.
