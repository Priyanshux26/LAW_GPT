967 of 2007 was registered, (b) the respondent no. 1 is 72 years old and no purpose would be served if the respondent no. 1 was made to face trial at this stage when the Case Crime No. 617 of 2007 was admittedly filed in the 2007, (c) the Trial Court has already convicted all the accused including Ashok Dixit by way of its in 10.07.2015, (d) respondent no. 1 has retired from Police service in 2015 and 9 years have passed since then, (e) No departmental inquiry was initiated against respondent no. 1 for the alleged act of registration of Case Crime [2024] 12 S.C.R. 793 Om Prakash Yadav v. Niranjan Kumar Upadhyay & Ors. No. 967 of 2007 at the Murar Police Station, Gwalior, and (f) there is nothing to indicate that the respondent no. 1 is related to the accused Ashok Dixit. 30. The counsel submitted that the charge sheet should be read as a whole and there exists no circumstance or evidence to warrant any assumption of involvement of respondent no. 1 in connection with Case Crime No. 617 of 2007 for the alleged offence of conspiracy to commit murder. This is so because there are only two statements of witnesses recorded under Section 161 CrPC and such statements were recorded after a period of one year i.e., on 25.10.2008 from the date of registration of case Crime No. 617 of 2007 i.e., on 12.10.2007. These two statements are the sole basis for instituting a prosecution against the respondent ro. 1. Furthermore, the said witnesses were not examined in the trial whereby the 12 accused including Ashok Dixit stood convicted vide dated 10.07.2015. 31. It was also submitted that there is a material contradiction in the case of the prosecution. The statements of the two witnesses i.e., Ramesh and Barelal suggest that the respondent no. 1 was seen with Ashok Dixit in Gwalior since they had verbatim deposed that they had heard respondent no. 1 telling Ashok Dixit that they would create a false plea of alibi. However, the eyewitnesses have all deposed that Ashok Dixit was present at the place of the incident in Firozabad where the firing had occurred. These two contradictory statements confirm the presence of Ashok Dixit in Firozabad and also in Gwalior and are therefore, ex-facie derogatory to each other. 32. The counsel submitted that Section 201 CrPC would not apply to the instant facts and circumstances. There is no allegation that the respondent no. 1 had conspired with the other co-accused persons for the offence of murder and the only allegation that surfaces from the charge sheet is that a false alibi was provided in to shield Ashok Dixit by registering an FIR under the Excise Act in Gwalior. The said alleged act was made after the commission of the offence of murder and there is nothing on record to even remotely suggest that the respondent no. 1 had knowledge about the incident of murder. 33. In light of the above, the counsel submitted that the impugned and of the High Court quashing the criminal proceedings against the respondent no.
