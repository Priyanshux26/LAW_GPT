Judged by these pronounced principles, the High Court clearly exceeded its jurisdiction under Article 227 in passing the impugned .” 32. In the more recent Garment Craft (supra), this Court put it C thus: “15. Having heard the counsel for the parties, we are clearly of the view that the impugned [Prakash Chand Goel v. Garment Craft, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 11943] is contrary to law and cannot be sustained for several reasons, D but primarily for deviation from the limited jurisdiction exercised by the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The High Court exercising supervisory jurisdiction does not act as a court of first appeal to reappreciate, reweigh the evidence or facts upon which the E determination under challenge is based. Supervisory jurisdiction is not to correct every error of fact or even a legal flaw when the final finding is justified or can be supported. The High Court is not to substitute its own decision on facts and conclusion, for that of the inferior court or tribunal. [Celina Coelho Pereira v. Ulhas Mahabaleshwar F Kholkar, (2010) 1 SCC 217 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 69] The jurisdiction exercised is in the nature of correctional jurisdiction to set right grave dereliction of duty or flagrant abuse, violation of fundamental principles of law or justice. The power under Article 227 is exercised sparingly in G appropriate cases, like when there is no evidence at all to justify, or the finding is so perverse that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a conclusion that the court or tribunal has come to. It is axiomatic that such discretionary relief must be exercised to ensure there is no miscarriage of justice.” H 850 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 33. Although the Impugned is a short one, for the additional reasons afore-enumerated, and keeping in view the principles enunciated in the preceding paragraphs, we do not deem it appropriate to tinker therewith. 34. On an overall circumspection of the facts and circumstances, B this Court does not find any infirmity in Impugned , and the s dated 04.02.2019 and 03.12.2021 passed by the Revenue Court. Interim dated 31.10.2022 is vacated. 35. Accordingly, this appeal stands dismissed. C 36. Any pending application(s) is/are closed. 37. Costs made easy. Ankit Gyan Appeal dismissed.
