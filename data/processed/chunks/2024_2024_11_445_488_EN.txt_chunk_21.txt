See MANDATE (1) 2. a written direction or command delivered by a government official, esp. a court or judge.” 43. The press release of 01.10.2009 certainly does not fulfil the meaning of the word “” as understood in legal parlance. As explained earlier, the Press Release with all its future eventualities and conditionalities is only a proposal and it is only after the undertakings were agreed to be given by the State Government that a final shape was given in the form of a Section 25 customs notification on 11.12.2009 and by the policy document of 14.12.2009. 478 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The press release announcing the cabinet approval of certain modifications envisaged in the existing Mega Power Policy is not law as defined in Clause 1.1 of the PPA. Further, the press release does not enact, adopt, promulgate, amend, modify or repeal any existing law or bring into effect any law. This aspect has been elaborated hereinbelow. Hence, the appellant’s would fail on the ground that the press release of 01.10.2009 is not law and as of 01.10.2009, the continuing legal regime was as per the notification of 01.03.2002 issued under Section 25 of the Customs Act and the Mega Power Policy of 07.08.2006 and there was no alteration of that legal regime on 01.10.2009. The change in law occurred only on 11.12.2009/14.12.2009, and the respondent no. 1 has rightly been held by the fora below to be entitled to the benefits, which ultimately will go to the consumers. 44. The argument feebly advanced by the appellant that no notice of change of law was issued by the respondent under Clause 13.3.1 and 13.3.2 does not impress us. The said clause expressly deals only with a seller having to issue the notice if it is beneficially affected by the change of law. In this case, PSPCL is the buyer. Further, post the change in law on 11.12.2009/14.12.2009 there is a change in cost with the reduction of customs duty which will enure to the benefit the appellant-seller and under 13.1.1. the benefit ought to be passed on to the respondent. 45. The words of clause 13.1.1 read with the definition of law in Clause 1.1 are plain and clear. For a change in law to occur, the following events ought to have happened seven days prior to the bid deadline that is on 02.10.2009 in our case; (i) the enactment brining into effect, adoption, promulgation, amendment, modification or repeal of any law or (ii) a change in interpretation of any law by a competent court of law, Tribunal or Indian Governmental instrumentality provided such court of law, Tribunal or Indian Governmental instrumentality is the final authority under law for such interpretation or (iii) change in any consents, approvals or licences available or obtained for the project, otherwise than for default of the seller, which results in any change in any cost or revenue from the business of selling electricity by the seller to the procurer under the terms of this agreement or (iv) any change in the (a) declared price of land for the project or (b) the cost of implementation of the resettlement and rehabilitation package of the land for the project mentioned in RFP or (c) the cost of implementing [2024] 11 S.C.R.
