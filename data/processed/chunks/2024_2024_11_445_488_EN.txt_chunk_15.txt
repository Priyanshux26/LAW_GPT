47 of 2015 of the appellant. Against the said [2024] 11 S.C.R. 469 Nabha Power Limited & Anr. v. Punjab State Power Coroporation Limited & Anr. of APTEL dated 04.07.2017, appellant has filed Civil Appeal No. 8694 of 2017. We have in this not touched upon the issues in Civil Appeal No. 8694 of 2017. 26. Coming back to the of the APTEL dated 30.06.2014, the APTEL while dismissing the appeal insofar as the first issue of the Mega Power Policy discussed therein was concerned held that the press release did not indicate the terms and conditions on which the Mega Power Status could be made available; that the press release cannot be construed as a statement of law in view of the disclaimer; that the notification dated 11.12.2009 modifying the customs duty and specifying the terms and conditions for Mega Power is what is law under the definition in the power purchase agreement and that the Mega Power Status was received only on 30.07.2010. Certain other findings have also been recorded which are not directly germane in view of the decision that we have ultimately taken in this Appeal. 27. Aggrieved by the of the APTEL on the issue of the Mega Power Policy, the appellants have filed Civil Appeal No. 8478 of 2014. Contentions: 28. In support of the appeal, we have heard Mr. C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned Senior Advocate and in opposition thereof we have heard Mr. M.G. Ramachandran, learned Senior Advocate for the respondent no.1. Submissions of the Appellant 29. Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant contends that the effect of the Cabinet Decision must be seen with respect to the contours of the definition of law in the Power Purchase Agreement; that the definition includes “any ” of any Indian Government instrumentality and hence it cannot be said that the decision of the highest constitutionally entrusted body for formulating binding national policy is not law for the purpose of the PPA; that the appellant could not be expected to ignore the decision of the Cabinet dated 01.10.2009 announced through the press release being a prudent bidder/businessmen; that even the respondent concedes that the Cabinet Decision could lead to promissory estoppel against the Government; that clause 2.7.2.1 of the RFP deems that the bidders have factored in all “Required information/factors that may have any effect on the bid” and that the Cabinet Decision is at least an information/factor for bidding purposes. 470 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 30. Learned senior counsel contended that the appellant factored in the fiscal benefits accruing from the Mega Policy in view of the Cabinet Decision of 01.10.2009; that the appellant informed PSPCL by way of letters dated 02.10.2009 and 06.10.2009 about the factoring in of the benefits; that the Mega Power Policy 2006 amendments stood approved on 01.10.2009 and hence the same amounted to law; that the implementing actions that followed the Cabinet Decision also accord the same understanding as would be clear from the Ministry of Power letter dated 03.12.2009, the Minutes of meeting dated 28.10.2009 annexed to the letter dated 03.12.2009, the Memorandum dated 14.12.2009 and the fact that each department was bound to carry out the policy in pursuance of the Cabinet Decision dated 01.10.2009.
