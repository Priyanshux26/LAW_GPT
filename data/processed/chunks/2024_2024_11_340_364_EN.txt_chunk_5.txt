IMPUGNED 3. As noted at the beginning, the Division Bench allowed the writ appeal. The second show cause notice was quashed upon application of section 56(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003.15 3.1 On the question of whether the first respondent was liable to pay the charges for minimum guaranteed consumption, the High Court relied upon the decision in Raymond Limited v. State of M.P.16 to observe that the first appellant was within its right to demand minimum guarantee charges but there also existed a corresponding duty upon such appellant to supply electrical energy to such an extent, fulfilment of which duty had not been proved in the present case. 3.2 The High Court then embarked upon the issue of limitation, i.e., whether the appellants could recover dues for the period between June, 1996 and May, 2000, vide the second show cause notice. The question before the High Court was whether the liability which accrued to the first respondent under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948,17 i.e., when the first show cause notice was issued, could be enforced after coming into effect of the 2003 Act, i.e., when the second show cause notice was issued. The pivotal difference between the two legislations is that while the former did not prescribe a limitation period for the recovery of dues, the 2003 Act specifically prescribed such a period in the form of section 56(2), providing as follows: 14 Contempt Petition No. 559/2009 15 2003 Act, hereafter 16 [2000] Supp. 4 SCR 668 : (2001) 1 SCC 534 17 1948 Act, hereafter [2024] 11 S.C.R. 349 The Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitran Company Limited & Ors. v. Bapuna Alcobrew Private Limited & Anr. Section 56. Disconnection of supply in default of payment – (1) *** (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no sum due from any consumer, under this section shall be recoverable after the period of two years from the date when such sum became first due unless such sum has been shown continuously as recoverable as arrear of charges for electricity supplied and the licensee shall not cut off the supply of the electricity. 3.3 The High Court observed that since the 2003 Act had not been enforced retrospectively, the liability would continue to accrue to the first respondent well after the 2003 Act came into force. However, this liability, w.e.f. 10th June, 2003 could not have been enforced beyond a period of two (2) years, keeping in mind section 56(2) read with section 174 of the 2003 Act. 3.4 Consequently, the High Court observed that the first respondent’s writ petition having been disposed on 21st June, 2006, a period of two (2) years therefrom would be 09th June, 2008 whereas the appellants had only issued the second show cause notice on 07th January, 2009, which was evidently beyond the period of limitation. 3.5 In the result, the Division Bench reversed the and dated 16th July, 2009 passed by the writ court and quashed the second show cause notice issued by the appellants.
