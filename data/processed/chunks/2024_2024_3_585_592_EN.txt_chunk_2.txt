I of 1894), as amended in its application to Uttar Pradesh, which for this purpose shall be subject to the modification specified in the Schedule to this Act. (2) If any land in respect of which betterment fee has been levied under this Act is subsequently required for any of the purposes of this Act, such levy shall not be deemed to prevent the acquisition of the land under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (Act No. I of 1894).” 8. In purported exercise of its powers under Section 28 of the Act, the appellant-Board issued a notice on 17.07.2004 (Annexure P-1) giving a description of the Scheme called as the Sultanpur Road Bhoomi Vikas Evam Grahsthan Yojna at Lucknow. The said notice vividly described the lands/properties which were to fall within the Scheme, the map of the area, particulars of the Scheme and the details of the land which was proposed to be acquired was notified to be available in the Office of the Housing Commissioner. It was further stipulated that the objections to the Scheme shall also be received by the Office of the Housing Commissioner (Land Acquisition Section) within 30 days from the date of publication of the said notification. 9. It is a matter of record that Khasra No.673 at village Hariharpur did not find any mention in the aforesaid notification dated 17.07.2004. 10. The case of the respondents is that Khasra Nos.672 and 673 were mutated in their favour on 10.10.1999, as can be seen from the entries in the revenue record, a copy whereof has been placed on record as Annexure P.6. 11. It is also not in dispute that the tenure holding/ownership of Khasra No.673 was later on changed in favour of one Chandrika S/o Harishchandra, Guruprasad S/o Jawahir, and the entries to this effect were reportedly made in the revenue record on 13.08.2003 and 09.02.2004. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 589 U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad v. Chandra Shekhar And Ors. 12. While the respondents pleaded that the entries in the revenue record were altered fraudulently behind their backs in collusion and connivance with Chandrika and others and the statutory procedure envisaged to make such changes was not followed, the case of the Board is that the notice proposing to acquire the subject-land was issued to Guruprasad, in whose favour the entries subsisted on the date immediate prior to the issuance of Notification under Section 28 of the 1965 Act. In other words, the appellant’s stand is that they were not obligated to serve any notice on the respondents as they were not amongst the interested persons as per the entries in the revenue record, and that such a notice was duly served on the persons who were recorded as the tenure-holders as per the revenue record. 13. The question whether the appellant-Board ought to have served individual notice upon the respondents under Section 29 of the 1965 Act, has been answered by the High Court vide the impugned in favour of the respondents for two sets of reasons.
