Digital Supreme Court Reports the terms of his remit under the statutory regulations – These regulations have been framed by the Municipal Corporation in exercise of powers conferred by s.65 of the 1976 Act as extended to the Union Territory of Chandigarh – Clause (10) of Regulation 6 provides for three eventualities in which a ballot can be treated as invalid – None of the said eventualities were fulfilled in the present case – The vote was cast by placing a rubber stamp on the upper half of the ballot and hence the ink mark which was placed on the bottom half by the Presiding Officer would be of no consequence – Presiding Officer made a deliberate effort to deface the eight ballots cast in favour of the appellant so as to secure a result at the election by which the eighth respondent would be declared as the elected candidate – Result which was declared by the Presiding Officer being contrary to law is quashed and set aside – Appellant is declared to be the validly elected candidate for election as Mayor of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation.
