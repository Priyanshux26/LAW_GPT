An , it was noted, was passed thereon on 06.04.2004 allowing the second respondent to carry out repair and overhaul operations B inter alia subject to certain conditions. Next, the learned Single Judge noted the letter dated 13.08.2004 by the General Manager of the District Industries Centre to the second appellant. It reads: “the Commissioner of Industries, Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad informed that M/s.Concast Ferro Inc, Dusi Village, Amadalavalasa C Mandal, Srikakulam District who have obtained IEM No. 2284/ SIA/IMO/2004 dt.25.06.2004 for establishing unit for the line of activity (1) Pig Iron (2) Granualated slag and (3) Coke Fines by acquiring the sick unit through official liquidator,High Court of Andhra Pradesh as a new Entrepreneur is entitled for availing 50% Exemption Duty exclusive under NIP 2000-2005 scheme.

In myconsidered opinion, petitioners B claiming benefit underG.O.Ms.No.103 dated 07.02.2001, while contendingthat the sale deed in question is for Land, Buildingsand Civil works only, but not plant and machinery,would be incongruous, because the intention of theGovernment in passing the above G.O., obviously, isto give benefit to ‘industrial units’.
