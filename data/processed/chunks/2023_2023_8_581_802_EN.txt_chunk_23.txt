But when it comes to private citizens who are not public functionaries, the right to privacy under Article 21 was held to trump the right to know under D Article 19(1)(a). This was in the case of Ram Jethmalani vs. Union of India8, which concerned the right to privacy of account holders. In Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India9, this Court struck a balance between the right of the media under Article 19(1)(a) with the right to fair trial E under Article 21. The argument that free speech under Article 19(1)(a) was a higher right than the right to reputation under Article 21 was rejected by this Court in Subramanian Swamy vs. Union of India, Ministry of Law10 in which Section 499 IPC was under challenge. The right to free F speech was balanced with the right to pollution free life in Noise Pollution (V.), in Re11 and the right to fair trial of the accused was balanced with the right to fair trial of the victim in Asha Ranjan vs. State of Bihar12. 4 (2013) 16 SCC 82 5 (1994) 6 SCC 632 G 6 (2003) 4 SCC 399 7 (1955) 1 SCR 608 8 (2011) 8 SCC 1 9 (2012) 10 SCC 603 10 (2016) 7 SCC 221 11 (2005) 5 SCC 733 H 12 (2017) 4 SCC 397 616 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A Question No. 2 (ii) There are some fundamental rights which are specifically granted against non-State actors. Article 15(2)(a) – access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment, Article 17 – untouchability, Article 23 – forced B labour and Article 24- prohibition of employment of children in factories, mines etc., are rights which are enforceable against private citizens also. Some aspects of Article 21 such as the right to clean environment have been enforced against private parties as well. The State is also under a Constitutional duty to ensure that the rights of its citizens C are not violated even by non-State actors and ensure an environment where each right can be exercised without fear of undue encroachment. In People’s Union for Democratic Rights vs. Union of India13, while rejecting the contention of the State that it was the obligation of the D private party i.e., the contractor to follow the mandate of Article 24 of the Constitution and the relevant laws, it was clarified that the primary obligation to protect fundamental rights was that of the State even in the absence of an effective legislation. In Bodhisattwa Gautam vs. Subhra Chakraborty (Ms.)14, interim compensation was awarded E holding that fundamental rights under Article 21 can be enforced even against private bodies and individuals. Public law remedy has been repeatedly resorted to even against non-State actors when their acts have violated the fundamental rights of other citizens. Award of damages F against non-State actors for violation of the right to clean environment under Article 21 was laid down in M.C. Mehta vs. Kamal Nath15.
