The appellant took admission in National Inter College, Barabanki on 25.07.1995 and thereafter since he could not pay his tuition fee, his name was removed as a student from the college register on 30.12.1995. The date of birth which was registered in the said school was 05.07.1980. The date of birth, however, was not taken to be the correct date of birth in the earlier fi ndings, since the appellant had not produced any certifi cate before the inquiry offi cer on the basis of which 276 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. the date of birth i.e., 05.07.1980 was registered in the school register of National Inter College. In the subsequent enquiry though he submitted the transfer certifi cate from the earlier school register but the same could not be verifi ed to the satisfaction of the inquiry offi cer and consequently the date of birth as claimed by the appellant (05.07.1980) was not accepted. In the latest enquiry, which has been conducted by the Additional Sessions Judge, Barabanki dated 28.09.2022, the appellant had produced relevant certifi cates of all three schools he had attended. 28. First is the certifi cate from Primary School Bhatgawan, Barabanki, which was the fi rst school attended by the appellant and where his date of birth recorded was 05.07.1980. The Sessions Judge himself has seen the school register of the school and had taken the statement of the principal of the school to consider the veracity of the school register. The other documents examined were the transfer certifi cates of High School, Kamela and National Inter College and the relevant registers of the said schools. The Additional Sessions Judge, who did not doubt the veracity of any of these documents which were placed before him, has given a categorical fi nding that what has been consistent is that, in all the schools that he has attended, his date of birth remains the same i.e., 05.07.1980. 29. However, there are two certifi cates which have not been considered by the Additional Sessions Judge in his latest report. The fi rst is the Family Register in which the year in which appellant was born is recorded as 1975. As deposed by the concerned Gram Panchayat Offi cer, there is no precise date of birth recorded in the Family Register and what has been recorded, is that the appellant was born in the year 1975. All the same this certifi cate will not have the same evidentiary value as the school certifi cates in the present case. Moreover, the entry is also not a precise entry. Under the 2007 Rules (i.e., Rule 12), the school certifi cates are given more importance than a Panchayat Register. The school leaving certifi cate of the fi rst school attended by the appellant which is Primary School, Bhatgawan will be a certifi cate that is liable to be considered and the certifi cate is a valid proof of evidence for determination of the age of the appellant.
