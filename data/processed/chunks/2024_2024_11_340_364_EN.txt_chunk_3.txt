IV. The first respondent sought permission from the appellants to install and run an 807 kVA biogas turbo generating set4 for captive use. On 30th May, 1996, the second appellant granted permission to the first respondent on the condition that the TG set does not run parallel with the appellants’ supply system, and that the TG set would be used only as a stand-by measure upon the failure of the appellants to supply power. Most importantly, in what would give birth to the dispute, the first respondent was bound to a monthly minimum consumption of units, with 35% load factor in case of no power cut, and 39% load factor in cases of power cut. V. A third supplementary agreement was executed by and between the appellants and the first respondent on 01st June, 1996, which provided for supply of an additional 560 kVA to the first respondent thereby increasing the total contract demand to 1170 kVA. VI. Alleging that the first respondent was running the TG set as a parallel source of power notwithstanding the supply of power provided by the first appellant, a notice dated 28th March, 20005 was served by the appellants upon the first respondent cancelling the permission accorded to the first respondent to run the TG set. VII. Challenging the cancellation notice, the first respondent knocked the doors of the High Court by invoking its writ jurisdiction. On the writ petition,6 the High Court passed an interim dated 04th May, 2000 staying operation of the cancellation notice, subject to the condition, inter alia, that the first respondent would deposit the ‘minimum guarantee charges’ payable as against the load of 807 kVA to be assessed by the appellants. 4 TG set, hereafter 5 cancellation notice, hereafter 6 W.P. No. 677/2000; first writ petition, hereafter 346 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports VIII. Consequently, the appellants issued a show cause notice7 dated 14th July, 2000 to the first respondent quantifying its liability in a sum of Rs 70,50,000/- (Rupees seventy lakh fifty thousand only). The first show cause notice provided a time of fifteen (15) days to the first respondent to submit a representation with respect to the notice. IX. The first respondent promptly challenged the first show cause notice by filing a miscellaneous petition8 in the first writ petition. The High Court, vide dated 14th February, 2001, disposed of the miscellaneous petition by holding the first respondent liable to pay the ‘minimum guarantee charges’, irrespective of whether the corresponding amount of electricity had been consumed or not. X. On 21st October, 2006, the first respondent withdrew the first writ petition, seeking to represent the matter before the appellants themselves on account of a change in the policy of the State Government, which no longer required a party to seek permission to install a T.G. set. XI. After a long interlude of two years, new life was breathed into the dispute by the appellants vide issuance of a show cause notice dated 07th January, 20099 through Rs 70,50,000/- (Rupees seventy lakh fifty thousand only) was once again quantified as the first respondent’s liability for not having utilised the minimum guaranteed consumption for the period between June 1996 and May 2000.
