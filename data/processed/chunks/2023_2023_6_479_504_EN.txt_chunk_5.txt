3.8 It is further submitted that the penalty leviable under sub- section (6) of Section 45 of the Act, is a statutory penalty and legislature has consciously used the word “shall” and even for interest the same language is employed in Section 47(4A) of the Act. That the assessee is G statutorily liable to pay the penalty and interest. That therefore, the High Court has committed a serious error in deleting the penalty and interest, mainly, on the ground that the amount of tax has already been paid by the assessee and that the assessee was under the bonafide belief that it was liable to pay the tax at rate of 2%. H 486 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 3.9 It is further contended by Ms. Mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State that the non-payment of penalty is met with consequences under Section 45 of the Act, 1969, and is recoverable as an arrear of land revenue. That it is well-settled that when non- compliance or violation of a provision is met with a consequence, then, the language of the provision is deemed to be mandatory in nature. It is B therefore submitted that the statutory penalty cannot be done away with. 3.10 It is submitted that in case the penalty is a statutory penalty, there is no requirement to prove mens rea or to consider the aspect regardingbonafide belief of the assessee while computing payment of penalty and interest. In support of the above submissions, learned counsel C appearing on behalf the State has heavily relied upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of State of Gujarat Vs. Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India Limited; (2022) 6 SCC 459andChairman, SEBI Vs. Shriram Mutual Fund and Anr. ; (2006) 5 SCC 361; Guljag Industries Vs. Commercial Taxes Officer (2007) 7 SCC 269; D Competition Commission of India Vs. Thomas Cook (India) Limited and Anr. (2018) 6 SCC 549,as well asthe decisions of the Gujarat High Court in the cases ofRiddhi Siddhi GlucoBiols Ltd. Vs. State of Gujarat; (2017) 100 VST 305 (Guj) and State of Gujarat Vs. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited; (2017) 97 VST 506 (Guj). E 3.11 It is submitted that mens rea can only be expressly included in the law by the legislature. The Court cannot fill in the gaps and purport the requirement of an intention or guilty mind of the assessee before levying penalty and interest where the same is not prescribed by the legislature. F 3.12 In so far as the decision of this Court in the case of Hindustan Steel Ltd. Vs. State of Orissa; 1969 (2) SCC 627 relied upon on behalf of the assessee is concerned, it is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State that the said decision shall not be applicable while considering penalty and interest levied under G Section 45(6) and 47(4A) of the Act, 1969. It is contended that even otherwise in the present case, the learned Tribunal had specifically recorded findings that the said decision shall not be applicable since there is nothing on record to prove that there was in fact a bonafide belief of the respondent - assessee.
