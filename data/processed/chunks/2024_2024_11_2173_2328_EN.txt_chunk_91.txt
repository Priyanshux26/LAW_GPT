The statutory safeguards, under the Arbitration Act provide a checklist and a counterbalance and thereby rule out inequality for the arbitrating parties. 34. The s in Voestalpine Schienen GmbH v. Delhi Metro Rail Corpn. Ltd12 (for short ‘Voestalpine’), TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd13 (for short ‘TRF’), Perkins Eastman Architects DPC v. HSCC (India) Ltd.14 (for short ‘Perkins’), and Central Organisation 12 2017) 4 SCC 665 13 (2017) 8 SCC 377 14 (2020) 20 SCC 760 2290 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports for Railway Electrification v. ECI-SPIC-SMO-MCML (JV),15 (for short ‘CORE’) have been discussed in detail in the respective s of my learned Brothers and therefore, only references to the said decisions to support the present opinion are being made. 35. In Voestalpine (supra), the issue before the bench of two judges was whether the panel of arbitrators prepared by DMRC violated Section 12 of the Arbitration Act. It was held that Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule does not bar retired government employees, from serving as arbitrators. It however held that in the case of a government contract where the authority to appoint arbitrators rests with a government entity, it is imperative to have a ‘broad-based’ panel to secure the principle of impartiality and independence of the Arbitrator. It is relevant to note that the basis on which such a panel was upheld in Voestalpine (supra) was that the persons who have been nominated are subject to the rigours of Section 12. 36. In Perkins (supra), the question before the 3-judge bench was whether the Managing Director of the Respondent, who is ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator under Section 12(5) read with Seventh Schedule, can nominate the sole arbitrator. Therefore, the Court was only concerned with the authority or power of the Managing Director and cannot be understood to conclude that unilateral appointments are impermissible. The distinction between ‘ineligibility’ and ‘unilateral’ appointments must be borne in mind. 37. Similarly, the question before the Court in TRF (supra) was in the context of the ineligibility of the arbitrator and should not be interpreted as conclusively deciding on the impermissibility of unilateral appointments. 38. In CORE (supra), the three-judge bench endorsed an arbitration clause that provided for current and former employees of one party to be appointed by the other party by asserting that such an appointment was balanced by an equal power of selection granted to the other party. As already noted by Justice Narasimha, the Court relied on Union of India Vs. Parmar Construction Company16 and Union of India vs. Pradeep Vinod Construction Company17but did not consider 15 (2020) 14 SCC 712 16 (2019) 15 SCC 682 17 (2020) 2 SCC 464 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2291 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company that these cases interpreted clause 34 of the General Conditions of Contract (GCC), prior to the 2015 amendment. The prescription for a broad- based panel as set out in Voestalpine (supra) was also not noted.
