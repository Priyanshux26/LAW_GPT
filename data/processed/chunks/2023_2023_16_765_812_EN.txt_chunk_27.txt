However, the appellants and the other accused followed them and went inside the house of Rizwan and fi red shot at Ram Kishan. As a result, Ram Kishan died on the spot. The accused persons also fi red shot at Rizwan and Rihan who tried to protect Ram Kishan. On their way to hospital, injured Masooq Ali, Rizwan and Rihan also died. It could thus be clear that, six deaths were caused on account of brutal fi ring by the appellants and other accused persons. The entire village and the people residing in the surrounding areas must have been shocked by such heinous and gruesome act. Not only that, one of the eye witnesses was also murdered during the pendency of the trial. The terror of the appellants and other accused persons was of such a high magnitude that even the witnesses who had received grievous injuries did not support the prosecution case and were required to be declared hostile. As such, we fi nd that four innocent persons were shot from behind. Two of them succumbed on the spot and two, who received serious injuries, tried to rush to the house of Rizwan to protect themselves. One innocent person, after hearing the sound of fi ring, came out and he was also brutally shot. Ram Kishan, who sought shelter in Rizwan’s house and Rizwan and Rihan who tried to protect Ram Kishan were also brutally killed. We are therefore of the considered view that the act of the appellants and the other accused would certainly be the one which shocked the collective conscience of the society and fall in the category of rarest of rare cases. 58. The next question that we will be called upon to answer is that, whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, imposition of death penalty on the appellants, would be warranted or not? 59.
