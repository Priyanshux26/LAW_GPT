The power of judicial review does not undermine the doctrine of separation of powers. Instead, it fosters it by ensuring a system of checks and balances to prevent constitutional transgression by any organ of the state. Separation of powers should be seen as a connection or link, rather than as a limitation or impediment; allowing the Court to ensure that the constitutional prevails.41 43. In the present case, the Respondents urged that the matter entails policy considerations, and hence, the Court should not step into it. 38 State (NCT of Delhi) v.

It is pertinent to iterate the language under Article 13(2) of the Constitution, which states that: "(2) The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.” The word “law” in Article 13 includes within its ambit, “any Ordinance, , bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law”. 45. Upon a perusal of the above, it becomes clear that though the term ‘policy’ is not expressly mentioned in Article 13, it becomes justiciable if it takes the shape of a law.42 In the event such a law is deemed void due to a violation of any fundamental rights outlined in Part III of the Constitution, it cannot be protected merely for being legislative policy. This view has been elucidated in A.L. Kalra v. Project & Equipment Corporation,43 wherein objections were raised on the grounds that the Court could not review the statute, as it entailed policy considerations. However, this Court, having taken these contentions into consideration, held that a legislative policy taking the concrete shape of a statute could be tested on the anvil of violation of fundamental rights. 46. It is, therefore, abundantly clear that courts possess the authority to scrutinize whether legislative or executive actions contravene the Constitution, and the designation of a decision as a policy choice does not serve as a fetter to the exercise of this judicial power. This aligns with the principle of separation of powers, which bestows upon the judiciary the authority to serve as a guardian against the actions of the legislature and executive, intervening to safeguard the interests of citizens when necessary. (b) Limits to judicial review 47. However, concurrently, it is imperative to acknowledge and respect the domain of the legislature and executive within the framework of the separation of powers.
