)]: Marriage as an institution is prior to the State, i.e., it precedes it – The status is still, not one that is conferred by the State (unlike the license regime in the US) – The marriage structure exists, regardless of the State, which the latter can utilise or accommodate, but cannot be abolished as a concept – Under this view, terms of marriage are set, to a large extent, independently of the State – Its source is external to the State – That source defi nes the boundaries of marriage – This implies that State power to regulate marriage does not sit easy with the idea of marriage as a fundamental right – There is no unqualifi ed right to marriage except that recognised by statute including space left by custom – Civil marriage or recognition of any such relationship, with such status, cannot exist in the absence of statute – An entitlement to legal recognition of the right to union – akin to marriage or civil union, or conferring legal status upon the parties to the relationship can be only through enacted law – A sequitur of this is that the court cannot enjoin or direct the creation of such regulatory framework resulting in legal status. [Paras 45, 47 and 149] – Held (per Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J.) (Concurring with S. Ravindra Bhat, J. ): Marriage is a social institution, and in our country, it is conditioned by culture, religion, customs and usages – The institutional space of marriage is conditioned and occupied synchronously by legislative interventions, customary practises, and religious beliefs – Given the nature of marriage as an institution, the right to choose a spouse and the right of a consenting couple to be recognized within the institution of SUPRIYO @ SUPRIYA CHAKRABORTY & ANR. v. 1211 UNION OF INDIA marriage, cannot but be said to be restricted – There is no unqualifi ed right to marriage guaranteed by the Constitution, that qualifi es it as a fundamental freedom – Right to a civil union or an abiding cohabitational relationship conferring a legally enforceable status cannot be situated within Part III of the Constitution of India – The right to marriage is a statutory right, and to the extent it is demonstrable, a right fl owing from a legally enforceable customary practice – In the exercise of such a right, statutory or customary, the State is bound to extend the protection of law to individuals, so that they can exercise their choices without fear and coercion – The claim of the right to marry, de-hors the existing statutory framework, is nothing but a claim to create a legally and socially enforceable status – Marriage laws do not stand in isolation, they interact in multifarious ways with succession, inheritance and adoption laws, to name a few – Creation of social institutions and consequent re-ing of societal relationships are ‘polycentric decisions’, which have “multiplicity of variable and interlocking factors, decisions on each one of which presupposes a decision on all others”, decisions that cannot be rendered by one stroke of the judicial gavel.
