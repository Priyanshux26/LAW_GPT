Without accessibility, individuals are effectively excluded from many aspects of society, whether that be education, employment, healthcare, or participation in cultural and civic activities. Accessibility ensures that persons with disabilities are not marginalised but are instead able to enjoy the same opportunities as everyone else, making it an integral part 19 “UDHR” 20 “ICCPR” 21 See also United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 14 on the Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health, UN Doc. E/C.12/2000/4, para. 12, 2000. 22 “EESC” 23 European Economic and Social Committee. (2014). Opinion on accessibility as a human right for persons with disabilities. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/GA/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52013IE3000 24 Ibid. 25 See CRPD, Article 9. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 985 Rajive Raturi v. Union of India & Ors. of ensuring equality, freedom, and human dignity. By embedding accessibility as a human right within existing legal frameworks, it becomes clear that it is an essential prerequisite for the exercise of other rights. iii. Accessibility Jurisprudence 23. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has consistently highlighted accessibility as a key issue in its dialogues with State parties reviewing their initial reports. Accessibility has also been a focal point in jurisprudence. In the case of Szilvia Nyusti, Péter Takács and Tamás Fazekas v. Hungary,26 the Committee emphasized that all public services must be accessible in accordance with Article 9 of the CRPD. The State party was specifically urged to ensure that blind individuals could access automatic teller machines (ATMs). 24. Similarly, the European Court of Human Rights27 has recognized the importance of accessibility in its s, ruling that public buildings should be equipped with facilities for PWDs.28 In 2022, EtCHR in Lárusson v. Iceland recognized that accessibility falls within the scope of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life.29 The case involved the lack of accessibility to cultural event venues in the applicant’s municipality, which hindered his participation in cultural and social activities, including attending events with his children.30 The Court acknowledged that accessibility is essential for individuals with disabilities to live independently and fully participate in society.31 The lack of accessibility affected the applicant’s personal development and ability to form relationships. 25. In Indian jurisprudence, several significant decisions have addressed accessibility within the built environment. This court in a catena 26 CRPD, Communication No. 1/2010, Views of 16 April 2013, Szilvia Nyusti and Péter Takács (represented by Tamás Fazekas, Hungarian Helsinki Committee) v. Hungary. 27 “EtCHR” 28 See Molka v. Poland, application no. 56550/00, decision of 11 April 2006; Zehnalová and Zehnal v. Czech Republic; Botta v. Italy. The complaint concerned the applicant’s inability to access the beach in a town that was not his hometown. 29 Lárusson v. Iceland, [43]. 30 Ibid, [43-46]. 31 Ibid, [46]. 986 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of decisions has reinforced the principle of accessibility in public infrastructure. In Disabled Rights Group v. Union of India,32 this Court directed all educational institutions run or aided by the Government to comply with their obligation to reserve 5% seats for the disabled and directed them to report their compliance with the same to authorities set up under the Act.33 This court also directed the setting up of a committee to suggest measures on how the physical infrastructure and methods of pedagogy adopted by educational institutions can be made accessible to the disabled within the stipulated time frame.
