On the H 44 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A said petition so filed on 22.06.2000, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Madurai (to whom it was made over) summoned K. Bhaskar Rao to appear before him on 17.07.2000. After broadly informing K. Bhaskar Rao of the consequences of his action, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate adjourned the matter to 18.07.2000. On 18.07.2000, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate read out the contents of his B confession statement and asked Bhaskar Rao whether it was voluntarily given by him after knowing the consequences. Once K. Bhaskar Rao answered the questions in the affirmative, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate passed an on 18.07.2000 granting pardon to K. Bhaskar Rao under Section 306 of the Code. Thereafter, the respondents filed a C final report on 16.07.2002 directly before the Special Judge for CBI cases, Chennai, without the case being committed by the Magistrate. Since the aforesaid K. Bhaskar Rao had already been granted pardon by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, the prosecution examined him as PW-16 before the Special Court for CBI cases and marked (i) the statement of K. Bhaskar Rao under Section 164 of the Code as D Exhibit P-44; (ii) the copy of the petition filed under Section 306 of the Code dated 22.06.2000 as Exhibit P-51; and (iii) the proceedings dated 17.07.2000 and 18.07.2000 of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Madurai, relating to the tender of pardon, as Exhibit P-52. 55. Appearing on behalf of A-7, Shri S. Nagamuthu, learned senior E counsel assailed the procedure so followed. According to the learned senior counsel, the Chief Judicial Magistrate/Metropolitan Magistrate is empowered to grant pardon during investigation, inquiry or trial and a Magistrate of first class is empowered to grant pardon while inquiring into or trying an offence. This is by virtue of sub-section (1) of Section F 306 of the Code. In the case on hand, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate granted pardon at the stage of investigation. Therefore, it is contended by the learned senior counsel that the approver, in cases covered by Section 306(1), should be examined twice, once before committal and then at the time of trial. The difference between the examination of an approver at these two stages is that the approver is G examined as a court witness before committal, but as a prosecution witness during trial. Therefore, the learned senior counsel contended that such examination of an approver twice, is a mandatory requirement of clause (a) of sub-section (4) of Section 306 and that it has been held by a catena of decisions that the non-compliance with Section 306(4)(a) H would vitiate the proceedings. It is the contention of the learned senior A. SRINIVASULU v. THE STATE REP. BY THE INSPECTOR OF 45 POLICE [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] counsel that if the Magistrate, who grants pardon, has failed to examine A him as a witness as soon as pardon is accepted by the approver, the evidence of the approver is liable to be eschewed from consideration.
