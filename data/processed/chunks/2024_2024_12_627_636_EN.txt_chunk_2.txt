Consequently, the CBI registered FIR RC0102022A0006 (Predicate FIR) on 09.06.2022, under Sections 7, 7A and 8 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PC Act), as well as Sections 120B, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC), against certain functionaries of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education, and one Ranjan@Chandan Mondal who was allegedly engaged in an unholy nexus with varied authorities, so as to facilitate appointments of primary school teachers in exchange for substantial sums of money. The said FIR was registered on the basis that the selection process of Assistant Teachers and Primary School Teachers had been conducted in a dubious manner, considering that the answer key for the TET was designed in a way that would deprive eligible candidates and, instead, facilitate back door entry to such ineligible candidates who submitted blank examination papers. 5.
