Is that so? It means not from just 1971 it can go to 1990. Therefore, there is a big lacuna. I hope the Minister seriously considers this aspect. Unfortunately, the wording of this clause is not happily or properly set.” (Emphasis supplied) 157. Shri P. Babul Reddy, Member of the Rajya Sabha from Andhra Pradesh, during the aforesaid discussion on the Bill remarked thus94: - “Then, I will point out one more defect. The Bill says, after ten years of detection they would be entitled to citizenship, not for ten years from detection. This starting point from “detection” is wrong. It must start from a particular date. Otherwise, it would lead to a lot of anomalies. The Hon. Minister may see the point I am making. Justice Baharul Islam, the Hon. Member, here has given the figure of 5,66,000 people fall in category two, that is, those who came after 1966 but before 1971. So, the Tribunal has to enquire about these 5,66,000 people. They have to be detected, and then they have to be registered. From the date of registration their rights would start. They would have all the rights of citizenship for what time? For ten years. From what date? From the date of detection. Suppose, in one man’s case detection takes place in 1985 and in another man’s case the detection takes place in 94 Session No. 136, Rajya Sabha Deb., Statement of Shri. P. Babul Reddy on The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 1985 at cols. 327-329 (Dec. 2, 1985). 1208 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 1988. So, the 1988 man will have to wait for another ten years. So, it should not be from the date of detection. This is a great anomaly. I have not seen this having been pointed out. And I am sure, I am not running on a slippery ground. It means that about 6,66,000 people you have to make enquiries. The Tribunal will detect one man today, another man five years afterwards. Because there is delay in detection, why should that man suffer after ten years for another five years? So, this date should also be amended. It should be from a particular date. You can give one date. Irrespective of when detection takes place, he should have citizenship right from that date. In all seriousness I submit that this requires particular attention.” (Emphasis supplied) 158. If the statutory construction that there is no time-limit within which the exercise of detection under Section 6A(3) is to be completed is accepted as correct, then it follows that an immigrant of the 1966- 71 stream, upon detection, can avail the benefit of Section 6A(3) even today by following the procedure prescribed under the rules. Thus, it follows that an immigrant who would have entered in the 1966-71 stream and who gets detected as a foreigner of the 1966-71 stream today, can register with the registering authority and his or her name will then be struck off from the electoral rolls for a period of 10 years starting today.
