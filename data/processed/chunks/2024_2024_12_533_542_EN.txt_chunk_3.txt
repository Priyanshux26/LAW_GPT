The court must endeavour to find out the truth. There would be “failure of justice” not only by unjust conviction but also by acquittal of the guilty as a result of unjust or negligent failure to produce requisite evidence. Of course, 3 [2013] 14 SCR 983 : (2014) 14 SCC 295. [Vide Nageshwar Shri Krishna Chobe v. State of Maharashtra [(1973) 4 SCC 23 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 664 : AIR 1973 SC 165], Shamnsaheb M. Multtani v.

Digital Supreme Court Reports the rights of the accused have to be kept in mind and safeguarded but they should not be overemphasised to the extent of forgetting that the victims also have certain rights. It has to be shown that the accused has suffered some disability or detriment in the protections available to him under the Indian criminal jurisprudence. “Prejudice” is incapable of being interpreted in its generic sense and applied to criminal jurisprudence. The plea of prejudice has to be in relation to investigation or trial and not matters falling beyond their scope. Once the accused is able to show that there has been serious prejudice caused to him with respect to either of these aspects, and that the same has defeated the rights available to him under legal jurisprudence, the accused can seek relief from the court.” 8.
