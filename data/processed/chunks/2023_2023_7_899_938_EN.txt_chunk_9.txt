H PRINCIPAL COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, CENTRAL-3 913 v. ABHISAR BUILDWELL P. LTD. [M. R. SHAH, J.] (vii) Section 153A(2) states that if an of assessment or A reassessment made u/s 153A(1) stands annulled in appeal or any other legal proceeding, the assessments and reassessments which had abated under the second proviso to Sub-Section 1 shall stand revived w.e.f. the date of receipt of the of such annulment. B (viii) This revival is notwithstanding anything contained under Sub-Section 1 of Section 153A or Section 153. The proviso to Section 153A(2) states that such a revival shall again cease to have effect if the of annulment which gave rise to said revival is set aside. C (vi) It is submitted that therefore the spirit of the Act, 1961 is to assess the total income. The earlier regime allowed parallel assessments namely regular assessment/reassessment independently and simultaneously allowed assessment of undisclosed income for the block period under Chapter XIV-B. D Whereas the new regime has abandoned the parallel assessment scheme and made it into one unified assessment, once a search gets initiated under section 132 or books or requisition under section 132A. It is submitted that in the absence of any search under section 132 or a requisition under section 132A, the assessment of ‘total income’ should be carried out under section 143, 144 and E 147, i.e., regular assessment, best assessment and reassessment.
