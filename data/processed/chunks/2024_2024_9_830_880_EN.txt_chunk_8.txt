Therefore, the amendment to Regulation 33(1) was applicable to reservation of road and not for any other amenity. It was also clarified that the amendment will not apply where the FSI granted in lieu of road had been utilized and full occupation certificate had been granted prior to 17.06.2010. Therefore, after 17.06.2010, in case of a land reserved for road or road widening which was surrendered, if the amenity being a road had been constructed by the owner on the land surrendered, the additional FSI as provided in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 126 of the MRTP Act will be 25% of the area of the construction of road. Hence, Para 6 of Appendix-VII to Regulation 34 would apply and the owner or the lessee will not get TDR equivalent to entire area of the road constructed by him but it will be confined to 25% of the area. 4.5 It was clarified that pursuant to notification dated 16.11.2016, Para 4.2 of the Schedule to the notification would be the only clause applicable to the grant of TDR against construction of amenity and that from 16.11.2016, Para 6 of Appendix-VII would not apply to the lands with amenity surrendered after that date. In other words, Regulation 34 stands substituted by the Schedule to the said notification. It was further observed by the High Court that the said notification dated 16.11.2016 did not have a retrospective operation and it also did not take away the basis of the decision in Godrej & Boyce I. 4.6 It was further clarified by the High Court that in the case of Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra, 2014 SCC Online Bom 495 (“Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd.”), 25% TDR was granted to the petitioner therein in the year 2006-2007. Subsequent to the decision of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I, the petitioner therein had filed a petition. On the facts of the case in Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd., it was observed that there was no delay or laches. The said decision of the High Court was sustained by this Court in Civil Appeal No.1748 of 2015. This Court had also rejected the argument that the in Godrej & Boyce I should apply prospectively. 842 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 4.7 Finally, it was held that additional FSI or TDR in terms of Para 6 of Appendix-VII as well as in terms of clause (1) of Regulation 33 becomes available on surrender of the land reserved with or without amenity, as the case may be. After 17.06.2010, if there is surrender of land reserved for road or road widening on which road is constructed by the owner or lessee, the FSI or TDR will be available in respect of amenity of road as per Regulation 33(1) as amended. Therefore, the right to get FSI or TDR accrues at the time of surrender. 4.8 Thereafter, the High Court went into the facts of each of the writ petitions.
