However, in the tabular form in the first page, against the query – ‘Mortgaged with Bank - Yes/No’, the answer was stated as ‘No’. There was, thus, an apparent contradiction in the application itself. In any event, approval was accorded by the AICTE on 17.08.2007 to start the ‘Business School of Delhi’. 4. Thereafter, the Society submitted another application to the AICTE on 27.10.2007 seeking to establish ‘Business School for Women’, offering PGDM course. A day later, on 28.10.2007, the Society filed yet another application seeking approval from the AICTE to start a third institute, named ‘International Business School of Delhi’. The first and third applications were moved on behalf of the Society by appellant No. 1, being its Chairman, while the second application was filed by appellant No. 2, as its Secretary. In the two later applications, the Society failed to mention that the leased land was mortgaged but it disclosed the fact that it had already been granted approval in the year 2007 to operate another institute from the same premises. By proceedings dated 29.05.2008, the AICTE granted approval for starting the ‘Business School for Women’ in an extent of 0.8 acres out of the said land. On 19.06.2008, the AICTE accorded approval to commence the ‘International Business School of Delhi’ in the leased land. 312 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 5. While so, it appears that an anonymous complaint was made to the Chief Vigilance Commissioner alleging that officials of the AICTE had shown undue favour to the Society. On the strength thereof, the Chief Vigilance Commissioner referred the matter to the CBI for investigation. In the first instance, the Regional Officer of the CBI at Kanpur addressed letter dated 24.07.2011 to the Station-in-charge, Police Station Greater NOIDA, to register a case for investigation but the District Police of Gautambudh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, opined that the complaint did not justify registering of a FIR and/or proceeding with investigation as no cognizable offence was made out. 6. However, on 30.11.2011, Case Crime No. 219 2011 (E) 0016 was registered on the file of PS CBI, EO-1, New Delhi, under Sections 420 and 120B IPC along with Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. This FIR was registered against the appellants and unnamed officials of the AICTE, alleging that the appellants had obtained approval by deceitful means from the AICTE, in violation of Section 4.2(iii) of the AICTE Approval Process 2006. As per this provision, the land approved for starting an educational institution ought not to be encumbered. After completion of the investigation, Charge Sheet No. 11 of 2012 was filed by the CBI for offences under Sections 420 and 120B IPC, naming only the appellants as the accused. No official of the AICTE was charged with criminality in granting approval to the Society’s institutions. 7. Aggrieved by their arraignment, the appellants approached the High Court at Allahabad under Section 482 Cr.P.C, vide Application U/S 482 No. 37398 of 2012, seeking quashing of the criminal proceedings against them.
