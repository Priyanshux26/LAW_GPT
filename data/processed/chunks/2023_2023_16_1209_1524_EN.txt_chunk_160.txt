SUPRIYO @ SUPRIYA CHAKRABORTY & ANR. v. 1431 UNION OF INDIA [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] heterosexual relationships.26 This is not to suggest that other imbalances of power do not exist within non-heterosexual unions. Nevertheless, non- heterosexual unions are not limited by the legally and socially sanctioned gendered power dynamic that can be present in heterosexual unions.27 32. Legal recognition aids social acceptance, which in turn increases queer participation in public spaces. Through the medium of legal recognition, queer persons will have a greater opportunity to be ‘seen’ and ‘heard’ in ways not previously possible. Queer expression will help facilitate an expansive social dialogue, cutting across communities and generations. This dialogue will help us reimagine all our relationships in a manner that emphasizes values such as mutual respect, companionship, and empathy. Conclusion 33. Is this the end where we have arrived? The answer must be an emphatic ‘no’. Legal recognition of non-heterosexual unions represents a step forward towards marriage equality. At the same time, marriage is not an end in itself. Our Constitution contemplates a holistic understanding of equality, which applies to all spheres of life. The practice of equality necessitates acceptance and protection of individual choices. The capacity of non-heterosexual couples for love, commitment and responsibility is no less worthy of regard than heterosexual couples. Let us preserve this autonomy, so long as it does not infringe on the rights of others. After all, “it’s my life.”28 26 Abbie E.
