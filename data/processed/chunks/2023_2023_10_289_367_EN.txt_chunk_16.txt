Therefore, it is prayed to treat the word “means” in the definition of “Sikkimese” as an G inclusive one and include Indian settlers within this fold. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Vishundas Hundumal Vs. State of M.P., (1981) 2 SCC 410. 7.2 Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the intervenors has, in addition, also relied upon the Parliamentary Report of the Parliament H 310 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A of India (Rajya Sabha Committee) in the 145th Report dated 06.08.2013 recommending that the ambit of Section 10 (26AAA) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which exempted “Sikkimese Subjects” from payment of Income Tax should also be extended to all the Indian citizens and their descendants, who have been residing in Sikkim prior to 26.04.1975. B 8. Now, so far as challenge to the Proviso to Section 10(26AAA), insofar as it excludes from the exempted category “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” is concerned, it is vehemently submitted by Shri K.V. Vishwanathan, learned Senior Advocate that the same is discriminatory and based on gender inequality, which is wholly violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of C India. It is submitted that there is no exclusion of a male Sikkim, who marries a non-Sikkimese person from the exemption granted under clause (26AAA) of Section 10 of the Income Tax Act. 8.1 It is submitted that a woman is not a chattel and has an identity of her own, and the mere factum of being married ought not to take D away that identity. Reliance is placed upon the decisions of this Court in the case of Anuj Garg & Ors. Vs. Hotel Association of India & Ors. (2008) 3 SCC 1 (paras 21, 22, 25, 26) and G. Sekar Vs. Geetha & Ors. (2009) 6 SCC 99 (paras 52, 54), in support to the prayer to strike down and/or hold the Proviso to Section 10(26AAA) of the Income E Tax Act is discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. 9. Shri N. Venkataraman, learned ASG has tried to justify the classification by submitting that a conscious decision has been taken by the legislature/Parliament to grant the benefit of exemption to only those “Sikkim Subjects”, whose names have been registered in the Register F maintained under the Sikkim Subjects Regulations, 1961. It is submitted that therefore the same may not be interfered with. However, he is not in a position to justify the classification and satisfy the Court how such a classification will achieve the object and purpose of granting exemption under Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act. He is not in a position G to explain and/or satisfy the Court any reasonable differentia and/or justification to exclude the Indians, who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975 from the purview of Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act. He is also not in a position to satisfy the distinguishing features and/or the intelligible differentia, which distinguishes the persons, who are left out of the group namely, H ASSOCIATION OF OLD SETTLERS OF SIKKIM AND ORS.
