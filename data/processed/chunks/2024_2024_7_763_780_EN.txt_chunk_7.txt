whether on the basis of seniority or merit) is only a statutory right and not a fundamental right, we cannot accept the proposition. We have already stated earlier that the right to equal opportunity in the matter of promotion in the sense of a right to be “considered” for promotion is indeed a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 16(1) and this has never been doubted in any other case before Ashok Kumar Gupta [Ashok Kumar Gupta v. State of U.P.11], right from 1950.” 19. A similar view has also been expressed earlier hereto in K.V. Subba Rao and Others vs. Government of Andhra Pradesh and Others,14 Union of India and Others vs. K.K. Vadera and Others,15 Sanjay Kumar Sinha-II and Others vs. State of Bihar and Others,16State of Uttaranchal and Others vs. Dinesh Kumar Sharma,17 Nirmal Chandra Sinha 6 (supra) and recently in Manpreet Singh Poonam 7 (supra). 20. In State of Bihar and Others vs. Akhouri Sachindra Nath and Others,18 it was held that retrospective seniority cannot be given to 12 (1997) 5 SCC 201 13 (1997) 6 SCC 538 14 [1988] 2 SCR 1118 : (1988) 2 SCC 201 15 [1989] Supp. 1 SCR 751 : (1989) Supp. 2 SCC 625 16 [2004] Suppl. 2 SCR 834 : (2004) 10 SCC 734 17 [2006] Supp. 10 SCR 1 : (2007) 1 SCC 683 18 [1991] 2 SCR 410 : 1991 Supp (1) SCC 334 774 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports an employee from a date when he was not even borne in the cadre, nor can seniority be given with retrospective effect as that might adversely affect others. The same view was reiterated in Keshav Chandra Joshi and Others vs. Union of India and Others,19 where it was held that when a quota is provided for, then the seniority of the employee would be reckoned from the date when the vacancy arises in the quota and not from any anterior date of promotion or subsequent date of confirmation. The said view was restated in Uttaranchal Forest Rangers’ Assn. (Direct Recruit) and Others vs. State of U.P. and Others,20 in the following words : “37. We are also of the view that no retrospective promotion or seniority can be granted from a date when an employee has not even been borne in the cadre so as to adversely affect the direct recruits appointed validly in the meantime, as decided by this Court in Keshav Chandra Joshi and Others v. Union of India and Other18 held that when promotion is outside the quota, seniority would be reckoned from the date of the vacancy within the quota rendering the previous service fortuitous. The previous promotion would be regular only from the date of the vacancy within the quota and seniority shall be counted from that date and not from the date of his earlier promotion or subsequent confirmation. In to do justice to the promotees, it would not be proper to do injustice to the direct recruits….… 38. This Court has consistently held that no retrospective promotion can be granted nor can any seniority be given on retrospective basis from a date when an employee has not even been borne in the cadre particularly when this would adversely affect the direct recruits who have been appointed validly in the meantime.” (emphasis added) 21.
