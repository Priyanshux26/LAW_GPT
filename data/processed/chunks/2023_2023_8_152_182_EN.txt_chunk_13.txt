Hence, what is the truth and whom to believe is difficult to infer from the record. Circumstance of Scientific Examination, in particular DNA Report of the Scientific Officer D 50. We may examine the case from yet another angle and that being, as to whether, even if the recovery on the search conducted on 13.6.2010, 16.6.2010 and 17.6.2010 is believed to be so, either on the basis of information obtained from the police during investigation or as a consequence of statement made by the appellant or any other material E obtained by the police during the course of investigation, the same stands linked to the appellant or not. 51. We find on this count the prosecution has not sufficiently proven the case. This is for two reasons : (1) If the alleged house of the appellant was thoroughly searched on 13.6.2010, as is evident from memo Ext.35 and recovery memo Ext.36, then the question of recovery of articles on F 16.6.2010 should not arise.The house is nothing but a small room of 8.5 feet x 6.5. feet (out of which a bathroom was 2.5 feet x 2.5 feet), as is evident from Ext.35. The police party in the absence of appellant had microscopically scanned the said room, and yet could not find any material allegedly recovered on 16.6.2010 vide memo Ext.48; (2) Even the G recovered articles, be it of the search conducted on 13.6.2010, 16.6.2010 and 17.6.2010, do not sufficiently link the appellant to the crime. For elaboration, we extract herein in a tabular form, the articles recovered, numbered, accepted and the scientific evaluation thereof. H PRAKASH NISHAD @ KEWAT ZINAK NISHAD v.

Only stains of semen were found on the nicker (brown) belonging to the prosecutrix and her vaginal swabs. 53. To establish clinching evidence against the appellant, the prosecution seeks reliance on communication dated 16.6.2010 whereby B PW 13 sent certain articles for analysis to the Director, Forensic Laboratory, Maharashtra. In terms of the aforesaid, the articles, be that of the appellant or that of the prosecutrix recovered on 12th, 13th and 14th of June, 2010, are as follows : C D E F G H 174 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A B C 54. Perusal of these documents reveals that samples of the blood and semen of the appellant were sent for forensic analysis. Importantly D though, there is nothing on record to establish as to who took such samples, on what date, on how many occasions and why were they not sent all at once, we notice that none of the police officials have testified to the formalities of keeping the samples safe and secure being complied with.
