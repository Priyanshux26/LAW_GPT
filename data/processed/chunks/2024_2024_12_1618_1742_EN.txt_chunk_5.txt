[Para 173] 2. Even in the absence of a registered notice of pendency in terms of the amended Section 52 of TPA the said provision will not be rendered ipso-facto inapplicable, at best it would preclude the party seeking benefit of this doctrine to claim it as a matter of right, but by no stretch would it mean that the third-party conversely would be able to as matter of absolute right claim inapplicability of this doctrine – It would be the discretion of the courts to see keeping in mind the peculiar facts of the case to ascertain whether such doctrine ought to be applied or not – Where the courts are satisfied that the third-party had genuinely purchased the subject-matter property after an exercise of a reasonable degree of care and caution and that it was otherwise unaware of the pendency of proceedings, the courts would be circumspect to displace the rights of such bona-fide third-party by a mechanical application of the doctrine of lis pendens – Even otherwise, in view of the peculiar facts of this case, more particularly the fact that the petitioner could not have registered the same being only an auction purchaser and that it was the duty of the Bank to register the notice of pendency which was not reasonably possible in view of the haste that was shown by the Borrower and the Subsequent Transferee in redeeming the mortgage and thereafter immediately transferring the Secured Asset, the non-registration of notice of pendency is 1626 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports not fatal to the application of the doctrine of lis pendens in the present case. [Para 174] 3. In the present case, it is not as if the Subsequent Transferee was not aware of what was happening however, when things went wrong, they now cry foul of not being impleaded as parties and heard by this Court in the Main Appeals – Even otherwise, assuming that the petitioner and the Bank herein deliberately chose not to implead the Subsequent Transferee herein in to mislead this Court in the Main Appeals, the same is immaterial as the Subsequent Transferee too failed to implead itself despite being aware of the pendency of the proceedings before this Court – If at all they were so concerned about the transfer of the Secured Asset in their favour, either they ought to have themselves attempted to implead itself before this Court or requested the Borrower to do the same – In view of the Doctrine of Pari Delicto i.e.., ‘in equal fault, the law aids neither party’, the Subsequent Transferee cannot seek any benefit from the fault of the petitioner or the Bank when it is itself equally at fault – In view of the aforesaid, the execution of the Assignment Agreement dated 28.08.2023 and the transfer of the Secured Asset in pursuance thereto in favour of the Subsequent Transferee is hit by lis pendens despite the fact that no notice of pendency was registered in terms of the amended Section 52 of the TPA.
