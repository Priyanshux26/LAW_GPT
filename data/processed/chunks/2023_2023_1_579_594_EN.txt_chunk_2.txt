The High Court held that the scheduled properties in question F were exempted from the provisions of SARFAESI Act in view of Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act on the ground that the revenue records and Pattadar pass-books and the title deeds show that the properties were agricultural properties / lands and that no evidence is produced by the secured creditor that these G properties are non- agricultural lands and have been put to non- agricultural use after obtaining permission from the competent authorities. Therefore, the High Court has shifted the burden upon the secured creditor to prove that the properties are non- agricultural lands. [Para 7][591-B-E] H 582 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 1.5 Only in a case where the secured property is actually put to use as agricultural land and solely on the basis of the revenue records / Pattadar and once the secured property is put as a security by way of mortgage etc. meaning thereby the same was not treated as agricultural land, such properties cannot be said to be exempted from the provisions of the SARFAESI Act B under Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act. When no evidence was led at all on behalf of the borrowers that the secured properties in question were actually put to use as agricultural land and/or any agricultural activity was going on, the High Court has committed an error in applying Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI C Act and quashing and setting aside the entire Possession Notice, Auction Notice as well as Sale etc. [Para 7.2][593-F-H] 1.6 The High Court also materially erred in shifting the burden upon the secured creditor to prove that the properties were not non-agricultural lands or have been put to non- D agricultural use. When it was the case on behalf of the borrowers that in view of Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act, the properties were agricultural lands, the same were being exempted from the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, the burden was upon the borrower to prove that the secured properties were agricultural lands and actually being used as agricultural lands and/or E agricultural activities were going on. Therefore, the High Court has materially erred in shifting the burden upon the secured creditor to prove that the properties are non-agricultural lands or have been put to non-agricultural use. [Para 7.3][594-A-C] 1.7 The impugned and passed by the High F Court is unsustainable and is quashed and set aside and the and passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal-I dismissing SA No.171/2016 is restored.
