Plaintiff himself has stated that defendant no. 1 was in possession of the subject property and had sought to transfer possession of the same to defendant no.2, thereby establishing that he himself was not in possession of the subject property. We are not inclined to accept the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent on this issue. We note that after the death of the life-estate holder in 2004, there was no attempt made by the original plaintiff to amend the plaint to seek the relief of recovery of possession. It is settled law that amendment of a plaint can be made at any stage of a suit34, even at the second appellate stage35. 34. In view of the above, the second issue is answered in the favour of the Appellants herein and against the Respondent. CONCLUSION 35. As evidenced from the discussion hereinabove, the impugned before us fails scrutiny at the threshold stage itself, i.e. on limitation as also maintainability of the suit. This being the case, the of the Trial Court in O.S. No. 726 of 1993 as also the First Appellate Court in S.C. Appeal Suit 47/99 FTC-II Appeal Suit 113/2002 which dismissed the suit of Gopalkrishnan on the grounds of limitation cannot be faulted with. 36. The impugned in Second Appeal No. 1926 of 2004 dated 27th September 2012 titled as Gopalakrishnan & Anr. v. Vasantha & Ors. is set aside. The appeal is allowed in the above terms. Pending application(s) if any, shall stand disposed of. The holding in the s of the Learned Trial Court as also the First Appellate Court are restored.
