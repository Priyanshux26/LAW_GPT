Pending the suit, both the parties entered into a compromise, based on which, the suit came to be decreed in favour of the appellant, on 30.11.2013 and the Respondent No.1 - State of Madhya Pradesh did not raise any objection nor filed any appeal against the said compromise decree. In terms of the said dated 30.11.2013, the appellant applied for mutation of the said land before the Tehsildar concerned, who in turn referred the case to the Collector of Stamps, District Dhar (M.P). Upon perusal of the records, the Collector of Stamps initiated proceedings under Section 33 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, and consequently directed the appellant to pay a sum of Rs.6,67,500/- towards stamp duty, by dated 23.08.2016. Challenging the said , the appellant preferred a revision, which was dismissed by the Board of Revenue, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, vide dated 12.02.2019. Aggrieved by the same, the appellant preferred Miscellaneous Petition No.3317 of 2019 to quash the said s passed by the Collector of Stamps as well as the Board of Revenue. By the impugned herein, the High Court dismissed the said Miscellaneous Petition, relying on its earlier dated 24.07.2019 passed in M.P.No.3634 of 2019,3 wherein, reference was made to (i)the decision of this Court in Bhoop Singh v. Ram Singh Major,4 in which, it was held that ‘if a compromise decree is obtained as a device to obviate payment of 2 Hereinafter referred to as “the subject land” 3 Siddhulal Kachi v. State of Madhya Pradesh and another 4 [1995] Supp. (3) SCR 466 : (1995) 5 SCC 709 1214 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports stamp duty and frustrate the latter requirement of registration, then such a decree is required to be registered under the Registration Act and as a consequence thereof, the stamp duty is also payable’; and (ii) the of the High Court dated 13.02.2017 in WP No.2170 of 2015;5 and ultimately, it was held that the consent decree obtained in the suit, through which, new right was created over the property, needs registration and for this reason, stamp duty is also required to be paid. Being dissatisfied with the same, this appeal came to be filed by the appellant before this court. 4. According to the learned counsel for the appellant, the issue involved in this matter is squarely covered by the of this Court in Mohd. Yusuf v. Rajkumar,6 wherein, the dated 13.02.2017 passed in W.P.No.2170/2015 relied on by the High Court in the dated 24.07.2019 passed in M.P.No.3634 of 2019, based on which, the impugned herein came to be passed by the High Court, has been set aside, by holding that a compromise decree does not require registration. It was further clarified in the said that ‘a compromise decree comprising immovable property other than which is the subject matter of the suit or proceeding requires registration, although any decree or of a court is exempted from registration by virtue of Section 17(2)(vi) of the Registration Act, 1908’. 4.1. Adding further, the learned counsel submitted that the High Court erred in placing reliance on its earlier dated 24.07.2019 made in M.P.No.3634/2019 (Siddhulal case), as the facts of the present case are clearly distinguishable from the facts of that case.
