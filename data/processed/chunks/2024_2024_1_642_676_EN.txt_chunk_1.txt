[Para 31] Income Tax Act, 1961 – s. 147 – Income escaping assessment – Expression “change of opinion” in terms of assessment proceedings: Held: Expression “change of opinion” would imply formulation of opinion and then a change thereof – In terms of assessment proceedings, it means formulation of belief by the assessing officer resulting from what he thinks on a particular question – Thus, before interfering with the proposed reopening of the assessment on the ground that the same is based only on a change of opinion, the court ought to verify whether the assessment earlier made has either expressly or by necessary implication expressed an opinion on a matter which is the basis of the alleged escapement of income that was taxable – If the assessment is non-speaking, cryptic or perfunctory in nature, it may be difficult to attribute to the assessing officer any opinion on the questions that are raised in the proposed reassessment proceedings. [Para 36] Income Tax Act, 1961 – s. 139 – Return of income – Obligation on assessee to disclose all material facts necessary for his assessment: 644 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: s.139 places an obligation upon every person to furnish voluntarily a return of his total income if such income during the previous year exceeded the maximum amount which is not chargeable to income tax – Assessee is under further obligation to disclose all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year fully and truly – While the duty of the assessee is to disclose fully and truly all primary and relevant facts necessary for assessment, it does not extend beyond this – Once the primary facts are disclosed by the assessee, the burden shifts onto the assessing officer. [Para 41] s. 139 – Return of income – When to be treated as invalid return: Held: U/s. 139(9), where the assessing officer considers that the return of income furnished by the assessee is defective, he may intimate the defect to the assessee and give him an opportunity to rectify the defect within fifteen days from the date of such intimation or within such further period, the assessing officer may in his discretion allow – Burden is on the assessing officer – If he does not exercise the discretion, the return of income cannot be construed as a defective return – If the defect is not rectified within the specified period or within the further period as may be allowed, the return shall be treated as an invalid return – In such an eventuality, it would be construed that the assessee had failed to furnish the return.
