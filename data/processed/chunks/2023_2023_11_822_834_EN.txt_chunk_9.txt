peculiar situation, the Court found that the termination was not simpliciter, but it was punitive 20. Similarly, in the case of Amar Kumar (supra), wherein the Court found that the appellant therein had instigated to do commotion/agitation/ protest and also raised slogans by spreading false rumours in connection with the death of one of the trainees, which was the foundation to pass the for termination. Thus, in the said case, the Court was of the opinion that the of termination cannot be simpliciter. In both the cases as referred above, the allegation of serious misconduct is common, unlike in the instant case, wherein, the foundation of discharge is not on any serious allegation or act of misconduct. The discharge was passed on the recommendation of the concerned supervisory authority of the Training Centre due to prolonged absence from training without any intimation. The authority found that the probationer constable has no interest in training, and no sense of responsibility, hence, he cannot prove himself a good, effi cient police offi cer. In view of above discussion, both the referred cases are distinguishable on facts. 21. For the reasons discussed above, we are of the considered opinion that the view taken by the High Court and also by the two courts below is completely erroneous in law and must be set-aside. The appeals are accordingly allowed. The s and decree passed by the High Court and also by the fi rst appellate Court and Civil Judge (Jr. Division) are set- aside, and the suit fi led by the respondent-plaintiff shall stand dismissed. No as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals allowed. Nidhi Jain
