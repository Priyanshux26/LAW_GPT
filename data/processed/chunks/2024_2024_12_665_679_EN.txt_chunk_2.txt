2.3.2 The dispute regarding the death of Mardan was resolved with the Court observing that he had indeed died prior to the coming into force of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. To return such a finding, reliance was placed on the evidence of PW1, Ugrasen PW2 and Karamaha PW3. It was further stated that DW1 himself, in his cross- examination, accepted such a fact. 2.3.3 Qua the possession of the suit property, it was held that post the death of Mardan in 1951, Puni Ram, father of the plaintiff, took possession. Any right possessed by Mardan would not have transferred over to his daughters as prior to the HSA 1956, a daughter does not receive any property upon the death of her father. 2.3.4 In conclusion, it was held that the defendants did not have any right of ownership over the property, which originally belonged to Mardan and that the successors of Puni Ram had the right over the said property. It was [2024] 12 S.C.R. 669 Tirith Kumar & Ors. v. Daduram & Ors. ed that the defendants would not interfere in the ownership of the plaintiffs. 2.4 The defendants, aggrieved by the findings summarised above, appealed the . The First Appellate Court agreed with the findings arrived by the Court below in as much as that both parties did indeed follow the Hindu Religion and that the death of Mardan was prior to coming into force of the HSA, 1956, and as a result, the daughters of Mardan had no right over the subject property. 2.5 Further aggrieved, the matter was carried to the High Court in the Second Appeal. The substantial questions of law framed are as under: 1. Whether the parties follow the principle of Hindu Law and have been following as on today? 2. Whether Mardan and Puni Ram in succession the property which they had received and from the said property the income which accrued from the same both Mardan and Puni Ram purchased other property? 3. Whether the death of Mardan was done in the year 1951 since then the property of Muni Ram in succession has received and at present the Plaintiffs are in use, occupation and possession of the said property? 4. Whether the defendants, in accordance with law, got their name entered and are in use, occupation and possession? 5. Assistance and expenses 6. Whether Mardan died before coming into force the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, in case yes and then the results? 2.6 The reasoning of the High Court in overturning the findings returned by the Courts below is that: 2.6.1 The Court noticed Section 2 (2) of the HSA, 1956 and the of this Court in Madhu Kishwar & Ors. v. State of Bihar,4 and held that HSA, 1956 does not apply 4 (1996) 5 SCC 125 670 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports to the parties as they are Sawara, a notified scheduled tribe within the meaning of Article 366(25), and there is no notification on record which de-notifies them or directs the application of HSA, 1956 to them.
