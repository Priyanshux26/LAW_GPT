The of the Trial Court dated 03.09.2001 has been upheld by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana as per dated 19.02.2014 in appeal. 2. A First Information Report was lodged on 23.10.2000 by Gian Chand (complainant), who is the father-in-law of appellant’s elder brother Pappu. It states that on 02.09.2000, Pappu requested the complainant to send his younger daughter (who is the present prosecutrix), to his house for taking care of her sister, who had just given birth to a girl child. It is alleged that the prosecutrix at the relevant time was 15 years of age. The prosecutrix was sent by her father to live for some time at her sister’s matrimonial house. More than a month later, the prosecutrix returned to her house, tells her mother that while she was in the house of her sister, the present appellant Manak Chand @ Mani who is the younger brother of Pappu, raped her and thereafter repeated the same off ence two to three times. Initially, considering MANAK CHAND @ MANI v. THE STATE OF HARYANA 77 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] the relations between the families, the matter was being “settled”, and the two families had even agreed for the marriage of the prosecutrix with the appellant Manak Chand @ Mani. But it is alleged that the family of the appellant later turned down the off er on 23.10.2000, which led to the lodging of an FIR at Police Station City Dabwali under Sections 376, 342 and 506 of IPC.
