(f) It cannot be termed as a substantive procedural provision nor is it a substantive penal provision. (g) At best, Section 6A of the DSPE Act was purely technical, procedural precondition, which was preliminary in nature and was to be exercised prior to the stage of investigation. 10.9. It is settled proposition that declaration of unconstitutionality renders a law to be non est, void ab initio or unenforceable, as the case may be, subject to the legislature to cure the basis of the said unconstitutionality. Reliance was placed upon the following s of this Court in his context: (1) Keshavan Madhava Menon Vs. The State of Bombay14; (2) Behram Khurshed Pesikaka Vs. The State of Bombay15; (3) M.P.V. Sundararamier and Co. Vs. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Another16; (4) Deep Chand Vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh and Others17; 14 1951 SCR 228 15 (1955) 1 SCR 613 16 1958 SCR 1422 17 1959 SCR Suppl. (2) 8 16 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. (5) Mahendra Lal Jaini Vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh and Others18; (6) Municipal Committee, Amritsar and others Vs. State of Punjab and Others19; (7) The State of Manipur & Ors. Vs. Surjakumar Okram & Ors.20; 10.10. The common opinion culled out from the various opinions rendered in the above s is that such declaration makes the law unenforceable and such unenforceability relates back. It was, thus, submitted that in the case of Subramanian Swamy (supra) relates back to the point when Section 6A was inserted in the DSPE Act. 10.11. Further submission is that a decision of this Court enunciating a principle of law is applicable to all cases irrespective of its stage of pendency as it is assumed that what is enunciated by this Court is in fact the law from inception. There can be no prospective overruling unless expressly indicated in clear and positive terms. If the Constitution Bench in the case of Subramanian Swamy (supra) had any intentions of declaring that the same would be prospective in application, then the same should have been specifi cally and discretely stated therein. In absence of such declaration, the natural assumption is that the same is retrospective applying the Blackstonian theory of precedence. 10.12. Reference was made by Shri Mehta to the cases of I.C. Golaknath & Ors. Vs. State of Punjab21and Anr. and Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad and Others Vs. B. Karunakar and Others22 for the proposition that prospective overruling is to be exercised as an exception in rare circumstances and such power should be seldom exercised. He has further placed reliance upon a of this Court in the case of M.A. Murthy Vs. State of Karnataka and others23 for the proposition that if prospective overruling is not specifi cally provided in the decision, it would not be open for Courts in future to declare such a decision to be prospective in nature.
