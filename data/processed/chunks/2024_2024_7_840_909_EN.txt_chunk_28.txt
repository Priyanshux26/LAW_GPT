22. In our considered view, the High Court has committed a manifest error in passing the impugned and adopting a mechanical process in appointing the arbitrator without any supportive evidence on record to prima facie substantiate that an arbitral dispute subsisted under the agreement which needed to be referred to the arbitrator for adjudication.” (Emphasis supplied) 78. It is pertinent to observe that in Antique Art (supra) the Court placed reliance on the decisions in Master Construction (supra) and New India Assurance (supra). Both these decisions were delivered before the insertion of Section 11(6-A) by the 2015 amendment to the Act, 1996. Thus, this Court in Antique Art (supra) failed to take into account the legislative intent behind the introduction of Section 11(6- A), which was also succinctly explained in Duro Felguera (supra). 79. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Mayavati Trading Private Limited v. Pradyut Deb Burman reported in (2019) 8 SCC 714 overruled the decision in Antique Art (supra) and clarified that the position of law existing prior to the 2015 amendment to the Act, 1996 under which referral courts had the power to examine the aspect [2024] 7 S.C.R. 881 SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Krish Spinning of “accord and satisfaction” had come to be legislatively overruled by Section 11(6-A) of the Act, 1996. The Court, while affirming the reasoning given in Duro Felguera (supra), observed thus: “10. This being the position, it is clear that the law prior to the 2015 Amendment that has been laid down by this Court, which would have included going into whether accord and satisfaction has taken place, has now been legislatively overruled. This being the position, it is difficult to agree with the reasoning contained in the aforesaid [United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd. (2019) 5 SCC 362 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 785], as Section 11(6-A) is confined to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement and is to be understood in the narrow sense as has been laid down in the in Duro Felguera, SA [Duro Felguera, SA v. Gangavaram Port Ltd. (2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764] — see paras 48 & 59 11. We, therefore, overrule the in Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd. [United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd. (2019) 5 SCC 362 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 785] as not having laid down the correct law but dismiss this appeal for the reason given in para 3 above.” (Emphasis supplied) 80. A two-Judge Bench of this Court in Uttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan Nigam Ltd. v. Northern Coal Field Ltd. reported in (2020) 2 SCC 455 was called upon to determine the scope of judicial interference at the stage of Section 11(6) petition wherein the plea of claims being time barred was taken by the defendant. Referring to the principal of competence-competence enshrined in Section 16 of the Act, 1996 and the legislative intent behind the introduction of Section 11(6-A) to Act, 1996 by the 2015 amendment, this Court held that the issue of limitation being a mixed question of law and fact should be best left to the tribunal to decide.
