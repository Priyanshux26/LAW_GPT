Despite the Arbitrator’s rejection of Claim Nos. 10 and 11, the appellant was awarded a sum of Rs. 1,44,83,830 (Rupees one crore, forty-four lakh, eighty-three thousand, eight hundred and thirty) towards Claim No. 12, along with an interest of 18% per annum under Claim No. 13 from 12th May, 1997 to the date of actual payment. The Arbitrator supported this award based on the undisputed fact that the delay in completing the work beyond the stipulated contract period was caused by the respondent and against the stipulated contract period of 12 months, the appellant was retained by the respondent for the execution of the work for an additional period of 3½ years leading to loss of the appellant’s profi t earning capacity during the said extended period. The loss of profi t was worked out based on a profi t allowance of 7½% per year, which the Arbitrator held to be reasonable in a civil works contract. Applying Hudson’s formula, the Arbitrator arrived at the fi nal compensation for loss of profi t, the computation of which is outlined below: Period of delay 42.5 months Contract value Rs. 5,45,27,386.00 Contract period 12 months 688 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R.

Therefore, evidence in respect of the said claim appears to be defi nitely not available on record.
