H 596 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 4.4 It is further submitted that as such while considering the application under VII Rule XI and the prayer for rejection of the plaint, only averments of plaint are material and can be taken into consideration and any evidence or averments made in the written statement cannot be considered. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Nusli Neville Wadia Vs. Ivory Properties B and Ors. (2020) 6 SCC 557. 4.5 Making the above submissions it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal. 5. We have heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the C respective parties at length. We have also gone through the averments made in the plaint. On going through the averments, it appears that the suit is essentially based upon the premise that there was an error in partition deed dated 11.03.1953 and in partition deed survey number 706/A9 was wrongly mentioned. Therefore, it is the case on behalf of the plaintiffs that Sarambee and other descendants including the vendors D of the appellants never had any right to effect transactions in respect of the land in survey number 706/A9. However, it is required to be noted that despite the above, very cleverly the plaintiffs have not sought any relief with respect to partition deed dated 11.03.1953. Deliberately and purposely, the plaintiffs have not prayed any relief with respect to partition E deed dated 11.03.1953 though it is the case on behalf of the plaintiffs that there was an error in partition deed dated 11.03.1953. It is to be noted that pursuant to the partition deed dated 11.03.1953, after the demise of the original land owner Nasyam Jamal Saheb, his five children namely, 1) Nasyam Jafar Saheb; 2) Nasyam Dasthagiri Saheb; 3) Nasyam Ibrahim Saheb; 4) Sarambee; and 5) Jainabee got partitioned the F properties under a registered partition deed dated 11.03.1953. Under the registered partition deed, predecessor in interest of plaintiffs, N. Ibrahim Saheb got 1 acre and predecessor in interest of vendors of the appellants Sarambee got 1 acre 16 cents. All the parties to the registered partition deed acted upon the said partition deed. That thereafter, further G transaction took place and Sarambee executed a registered gift deed dated 24.01.1968 in favour of her eldest daughter Kareembee – mother of the vendors of the appellants to an extent of lands measuring 58 cents. That thereafter, two sons of Kareebee who became co-owner on the death of Kareembee executed the registered sale deed dated 24.08.2010 in favour of the appellants in Survey No. 706/A9 to an extent H RAMISETTY VENKATANNA & ANR.
