The Board of Revenue recognized the rights of zamindars to the minerals, through Standing s. The Standing s also 313 S Sundararaja Iyengar (supra) 28. 314 ibid. 1708 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports governed the rights of the ryotwari pattadars with respect to minerals. For example, Resolution No. 277 of 1888315 declared that the State “lays no claim to minerals” in estates held on sanads of permanent settlement, enfranchised inam lands, etc. Moreover, for ryotwari lands it was declared that the right of the State in minerals is limited “to share in the produce of the minerals worked, commuted in a money payment, if thought necessary, by Government, in like manner with and in addition to the land assessment.” Thus, the colonial state did not claim subsoil rights with respect to lands held under permanent settlements, and only a limited right in lands held under ryotwari pattas. This system of law continued until Independence and even thereafter. 256. The regulation of mines and mineral development before Independence was governed by executive rules. In 1913, Rules for the grant by local governments of licences to prospect for minerals and of mining leases in British India were made by Resolution No. 7552-7581-121 dated 15 September 1913.316 Under these Regulations, prospecting licenses317 could only be granted with respect to minerals which were owned by the Government.318 The rules also required the licencee to pay royalty at a rate specified in Schedule A of the Regulations. The Madras Mining Manual of 1929 contained rules regarding mining and quarrying applicable to the Madras Presidency. Chapter V of the Madras Mining Manual stated that the State’s right to minerals varied according to the tenure on which the land was held. The Madras Mining Manual classified the land into three groups: Group A – Lands in which the State claimed no right to minerals. These included: (a) estates held on sanads of permanent settlement; (b) land held on title-deeds issued under the Waste Land Rules before 7th October 1879 in which no reservation was made of the right of the State to minerals; and (c) lands held on inam tenure. 315 See Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd. v.
