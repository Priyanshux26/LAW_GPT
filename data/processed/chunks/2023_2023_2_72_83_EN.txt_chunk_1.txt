It is also required to be noted that in fact Collector passed the dated 24.03.2021 pursuant to the directions issued by the High Court directing the Collector to take an appropriate decision on the representation/(s) made by the appellant. Under the circumstances the High Court has materially erred in holding that the dated 24.03.2021 passed D by the Collector cancelling the lease deed was without authority under the law. [Para 7.1, 7.2][80-E-G] 2. In the present case the Sub-Collector, Athagarh specifically directed not to issue the solvency certificate in favour of respondent no.1 herein in his individual capacity and specifically E directed to issue the certificate in the name of Trust. Under the circumstances it cannot be said that the original solvency certificate dated 07.12.2017 was issued in favour of respondent no.1 in his individual capacity by mistake. It appears that the respondent no.1 deliberately and willfully obtained the solvency certificate in F his own name though the property belonged to the Trust and the solvency certificate was required to be issued in the name of the Trust. He misused/used the solvency certificate dated 07.12.2017 for his own benefit illegally and submitted the same along with his bid and on the basis of the said solvency certificate he got the lease bid. Under the circumstances, the bid by using the solvency G certificate dated 07.12.2017 by respondent no.1 was non-est and void ab initio and therefore, the lease in his favour on the basis of such solvency certificate was rightly cancelled by the Collector.
