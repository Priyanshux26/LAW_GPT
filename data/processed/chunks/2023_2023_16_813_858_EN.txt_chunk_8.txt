Applications stand disposed of.” Summary of the Litigation before the High Court 4. A conspectus of the narration above would indicate that litigation emanated from three successive advertisements issued by the Selection Board/ Commission inviting applications for the post of JOA (IT). The fi rst advertisement is dated 13.02.2015 for 1421 posts (i.e., Post Code 447). The second is dated 18.10.2016 for 1156 posts (i.e., Post Code 556); and the third is dated 21.09.2020 for 1869 posts (i.e., Post Code 817). 5. Under the fi rst advertisement for Post Code 447, the advertised posts were fi lled with the aid of the dated 21.08.2017, which relaxed the advertised eligibility conditions. The litigation therein was initiated by two sets of candidates. One set comprised of those whose candidature got rejected because they failed to meet the eligibility criteria prescribed in the advertisement and the 2014 Rules. The other set comprised of those candidates who were aggrieved by relaxation of the eligibility criteria as it expanded the 828 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. zone of consideration and thereby reduced their chance of selection. They, therefore, questioned the validity of the of relaxation dated 21.08.2017 as also the selection made thereunder. The challenge laid by them was to the eff ect that once the 2014 Rules prescribed the essential qualifi cations, and the advertisement prescribed the same essential qualifi cations without reserving any power to relax the same at any later stage, how could there be a relaxation of these prescribed essential qualifi cations. Their prayer, therefore, was that the select list must comprise of only such candidates who hold the prescribed minimum eligibility qualifi cations by the last date for receipt of the application under the advertisement. Such a challenge was laid through Writ Petition No. 34 of 2019, which was originally fi led before the Tribunal as O.A. No. 5543 of 2017. 6. In respect of recruitment against the second advertisement for Post Code 556, challenge was laid by those who either held qualifi cations at variance from the one prescribed, or had certifi cate(s) / diploma(s) from such institutes that were not considered recognized.
