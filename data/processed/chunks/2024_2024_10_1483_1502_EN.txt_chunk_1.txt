[Para 21] Penal Code, 1860 – s.306 – Understanding of Courts – Unnecessary prosecutions: Held: The test that the Court should adopt in this type of cases is to make an endeavour to ascertain on the basis of the [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1485 Nipun Aneja and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh materials on record whether there is anything to indicate even prima facie that the accused intended the consequences of the act, i.e., suicide – Over a period of time, the trend of the courts is that such intention can be read into or gathered only after a full-fledged trial – The problem is that the courts just look into the factum of suicide and nothing more – Such an understanding on part of the Courts is wrong – In cases of abetment of suicide by and large the facts make things clear more particularly from the nature of the allegations itself – The Courts should know how to apply the correct principles of law governing abetment of suicide to the facts on record – It is the inability on the part of the courts to understand and apply the correct principles of law to the cases of abetment of suicide, which leads to unnecessary prosecutions – It is ultimately for the police and the courts of law to look into the matter and see that the persons against whom allegations have been levelled are not unnecessarily harassed or they are not put to trial just for the sake of prosecuting them.
