1 SCR 709 : (1992) Supp.1 SCR 709 5 [1992] Supp. 2 SCR 322 : (1992) Supp.2 SCR 322 6 [2020] 14 SCR 45 : (2020) 14 SCR 45 7 [2022] 11 SCR 1136 : (2022) 11 SCR 1136 8 [2022] 13 SCR 592 9 [1983] 2 SCR 287 : (1983) 2 SCR 287 10 [1981] 1 SCR 1024 : (1981) 1 SCR 1024 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1137 M/S Rewa Tollway P. Ltd. v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. 10. The next point raised by Shri Dave is that the aforesaid amendment was ultra vires, inasmuch as, the State had no legislative competence to bring in this amendment. Further, it was submitted that it was a colourable and excessive legislation and was a fraud on the Constitution of India, inasmuch as, the State itself in 2008 withdrew the Amendment of 2002. In support of his submission, he has relied upon the following : (1) Kunnathat Thathunni Moopil Nair Vs. The State of Kerala and another;11 11. The next submission of Shri Dave is that the Concession Agreement dated 15.09.2002 is not an instrument of lease and, as such, the demand of 2% stamp duty was totally uncalled for and illegal. According to him, the ownership of the project land has not been transferred by the State to the MPRSNN and, as such, MPRSNN could not transfer any ownership or interest to the appellants. The Concession Agreement was on the concept of public, profit, partnership (PPP mode). He has further elaborated his submissions by referring to Section 105 of the TP Act. According to him, in a lease, the following three ingredients must pre-exist: (1) There is a transfer of a right to enjoy such property. (2) It is made for a fixed time, express or implied or in perpetuity. (3) There has to be consideration of a price paid or promised. 12. According to Shri Dave, learned Senior Counsel for the appellants, lease means transfer of interest in the property to enjoy the property whereas, license means transfer of property but no interest in the property. According to him, in the present case, there was no transfer of interest in the property, as such, it would not fall within the definition of lease. He has further referred to various clauses of the Concession Agreement in support of his submission. 13. It was next submitted that MPRSNN is a 50% partner in the construction of the project which indicates that the Concession Agreement is a mutual contract and, as such, would not levy 2% stamp duty as imposed by the impugned s. According to him, out of a total project cost, 50% was to be paid by the MPRSNN. 11 [1961] 3 SCR 77 : (1961) 3 SCR 77 1138 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports According to him, respondent no.3, MPRSNN being a 50% partner in the entire road project meant that the appellant and respondent no.3 are equal stake holders and, as such, the unilateral imposition of 2% stamp duty of the entire project cost on the appellant was illegal and unwarranted.
