10. In the end, we must meet the argument raised by the Respondent No. 1 – Dinkar Venkatasubramanian, resolution professional for the Corporate Debtor – Amtek and the Respondent No. 2 – the CoC of the F Corporate Debtor – Amtek, that the present plea of the Appellant No.1 – Vistra to be treated as a financial creditor of the Corporate Debtor - Amtek should be dismissed on the grounds of delay, laches and acquiescence. The submission is that the Appellant No. 1 - Vistra had not objected to the resolution plan submitted by the erstwhile resolution applicant - LHG and, as a sequitur, its non-classification as a financial G creditor in the CoC of the Corporate Debtor - Amtek. Though this argument had appealed and had weighed with the NCLAT, in our opinion is untenable since the resolution plan submitted by erstwhile resolution applicant - LHG did not in any way affect the rights or interests of the Appellant No. 1 – Vistra as a secured creditor in respect of the pledged H 830 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A shares. Appellant No. 1 – Vistra has elaborately explained that LHG etc. were in negotiations with them so as to redeem the pledge and acquire the shares. 11. In view of our aforesaid findings, the impugned of the NCLAT affirming the view taken by the NCLT is partly modified in B terms of our directions holding that appellant no.1 – M/s. Vistra ITCL (India) Limited would be treated as a secured creditor, who would be entitled to all rights and obligations as applicable to a secured creditor in terms of Sections 52 and 53 of the Code, and in accordance with the pledge agreement dated 05.07.2016. C Present appeal is disposed of in the above terms without any as to costs. Nidhi Jain Appeal disposed of. (Assisted by : Shubhanshu Das, LCRA) D E F G H
