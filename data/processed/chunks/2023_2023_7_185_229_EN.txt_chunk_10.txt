It was noted that while the ‘pre-import condition’ was levied on duties collected under Sections 3 (7) and (9) of the Customs Tariff H 11 Supra note 1, para 27. UNION OF INDIA AND ORS. v. COSMO FILMS LIMITED 199 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] Act, 1975, in respect of the levies under Sections 3 (1), (3) and (5) A no ‘pre-import condition’ was imposed. The result was that if the importer wanted benefit of exemption from the levy of integrated tax and compensation cess, the fact that other levies were not subject to ‘pre-import condition’ was immaterial because the same inputs were subject to it. This resulted in inputs being subject to ‘pre-import condition’ B in respect of all the levies. The High Court then took note of the objects of the FTDRA and the FTP, and the subsequent Notification No. 01/ 2019-Cus dated 10-01-2019, whereby condition (xii) was omitted. The court held that the Union found it to be in public interest not to continue with the ‘pre-import condition’, for availing exemption from IGST and compensation cess leviable on material imported against an AA. This, C according to the impugned , vindicated the exporter/respondents’ stand. It was held accordingly that: “The condition of pre-import militates against the Advance Authorisation Scheme and therefore, the impugned condition (xii) in Notification No. 18/2015-Cus dated 1st April, 2015 D introduced vide Notification No. 79/2017 : MANU/CUST/ 0095/2017 dated 13th October, 2017 as well as the amendment in paragraph 4.14 of the Foreign Trade Policy made vide Notification No. 33/2015-2020 dated 13th October, 2017, to the extent the same imposes a “pre-import condition” E in case of imports under Advance Authorisation for physical export for exemption from the whole of the integrated tax and GST compensation cess leviable under sub-section (7) and sub-section (9) respectively, of section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act, do not meet with the test of reasonableness and are also not in consonance with the scheme of Advance F Authorisation”.12 14. The court also concluded that though paragraph 4.27 of HBP clearly permitted exports in anticipation of authorisation by endorsing the file number or authorisation number to establish co-relation of export/ supplies with authorisation issued, the Revenue wished to treat such G permissible imports made in anticipation of authorisation as replenishment. This was despite the fact that for the purpose of exemption from the other levies imposed under Sections 3(1), 3(3) and 3(5) of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 for decades the procedure was permitted, and continued 12 Supra note 1. H 200 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A to be permitted, (for the purpose of exemption from levy of IGST and compensation cess), yet, such imports were “suddenly” treated as “replenishment imports” which was held to be “incomprehensible”.13 The court held that that the impugned exemption notification and paragraph 4.14 of the FTP, to the extent they were impugned did not meet with the test of reasonableness and were held to be ultra vires the B scheme of the FTP.
