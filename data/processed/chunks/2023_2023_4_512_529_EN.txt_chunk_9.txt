shall operate and the matter shall stand closed. The appeals are A accordingly disposed of.” (Emphasis supplied) 28.Recently, this Court in Dhananjay Rai alias Guddu Rai v. State of Bihar13 (two-Judges) took noteof a rendered in B Bani Singh v. State of U.P.14, as under : “14. We have carefully considered the view expressed in the said two decisions of this Court and, we may state that the view taken in Shyam Deo case [(1971) 1 SCC 855 : 1971 SCC (Cri) 353 : AIR 1971 SC 1606] appears to be sound except for a minor C clarification which we consider necessary to mention. The plain language of Section 385 makes it clear that if the appellate Court does not consider the appeal fit for summary dismissal, it ‘must’ call for the record and Section 386 mandates that after the record is received, the appellate Court may dispose of the appeal after hearing the accused or his counsel. Therefore, the plain language D of Sections 385-386 does not contemplate dismissal of the appeal for non-prosecution simpliciter. On the contrary, the Code envisages disposal of the appeal on merits after perusal and scrutiny of the record. The law clearly expects the appellate Court to dispose of the appeal on merits, not merely by perusing the E reasoning of thetrialcourtinthe,but by cross- checking the reasoning with the evidence on record with a view to satisfying itself that the reasoning and findings recorded bythe trial court areconsistent withthematerialonrecord.” (Emphasis supplied) F 29.In a case with similar circumstance, we notice that the Allahabad High Court in Sita Ram & Others v. State15 has held that when the entire record was lost or destroyed and the reconstruction of the record was not possible, the Appellate Court shall retrial provided the time lag date of incident and the date of hearing of appeal is short. If the same is long and/or the FIR, statement, of witnesses under Section 161 G and other relevant papers are not available, the Appellate Court should not retrial. 13 2022 SCC Online 880 14 (1996) 4 SCC 720 15 1981 Cr.LJ, 65 H 526 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 30. In numerous s rendered by various High Courts, a similar view to the effect that a conviction cannot be upheld in the absence of the records of the Court below has been expressed. Taking note of Sita Ram (supra), the time elapsed between the occurrence of the offence and the appeal being finally decided, these courts have held that in the absence of essential documents such as the FIR or witness B statements, a retrial too cannot be said to be serving the ends of justice. [Khalil Ahmad v. State of U.P.16; Vir Pal v. State17; Hira Lal v. State of U.P.18 and Bhunda and Ors. V. State of U.P.19] 31.In the present case, the impugned of the High Court records the statement of the CBI that the records have “got lost”. The C “reconstructed” record consists of the following: i.
