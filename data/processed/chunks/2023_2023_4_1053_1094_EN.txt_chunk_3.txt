The petitioner seems to have developed a mall on the subject land and, as per the suggestions made in the referred communications, seems to have provided certain facilities to make it attractive but fact of the matter remains that the project has H BHASIN INFOTECH AND INFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATE LTD. 1057 v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH been implemented by the petitioner through private investment A and there is no participation of the State Government or any public sector undertaking or any instrumentality of the State therein. That being the position, claim of the petitioner to seek benefits flowing from the Office Memo dated 03.05.2016 falls flat and is knocked to the ground. [Para 15.3 & 15.4][1090-E-H; 1091-A- B C] 1.5. No SPV has been created in relation to the project of the petitioner with involvement of the State Government or any of its agencies/instrumentalities. Which particular agency is, then, to be termed as “working agency” for the purpose of the Office C Memo dated 03.05.2016 remains a question inexplicable. If the stretch of arguments of the petitioner seeking freehold land is taken into consideration, only UPSIDC could be termed as “working agency” for the present purpose but then, there is no partnership of UPSIDC in this project. [Para 15.4.1][1091-D-E] D 1.6. The subject land was specifically leased to the petitioner for a period of 90 years in terms of the allotment letter dated 05.08.2006 and then lease deeds were executed on 23.08.2006 and 30.03.2009. The construction was undertaken by the petitioner over part of the land in question where partial completion certificate was issued on 07.05.2011 and second E completion certificate was issued on 16.04.2015. Several significant consequences follow from this status of record. In the first place, when the land had already been leased to the petitioner and the petitioner is also holding the same as lessee under the lease deeds executed for the purpose, there does not appear any F reason, justification, logic or rationale that such leasehold rights be converted into freehold rights. Secondly, the amended policy which is sought to be relied upon by the petitioner came into existence only after second completion certificate had been issued to the petitioner and, as per the petitioner’s own assertions, the mall had been put into operation. No stipulation is found in the G original policy or its amendment that it could be applied with retrospective effect and to override the existing legal rights as also the existing legal obligations. [Para 15.5][1091-F-H; 1092- A] H 1058 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 1.7 Viewed from any angle, even on direct construction of the relevant clauses vis-à-vis the subject-matter of the present petition, it remains beyond a shadow of doubt that the policy in question with its amendment is of no application whatsoever in relation to the project in question. Therefore, the claim of the petitioner has rightly been rejected. [Para 15.6][1092-B-C] B 1.8. In relation to the relied upon letter dated 31.01.2015 sent by the Managing Director of UPSIDC, recommending the case of the petitioner to declare its multiplex, hotel and commercial construction as tourist destination, the same had been wholly baseless and rather unwarranted.
