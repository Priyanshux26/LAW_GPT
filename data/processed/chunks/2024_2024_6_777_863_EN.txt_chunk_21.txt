[2024] 6 S.C.R. 809 Shaji Poulose v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India & Others 4.8 Learned counsel for the petitioners have vehemently argued that in the absence of any statistics or data supporting the restriction on the number of tax audits and a related reasonable explanation justifying such a cap, this restriction could not be justified under Article 19(6) of the Constitution. Thereby, the petitioners have contended, that the limit on the number of tax audits a Chartered Accountant could accept has no reasonable nexus with the provisions of Section 44AB. 4.9 The petitioners have also drawn our attention to allegedly- identical Notification No.1/CA(7)/3/88 dated 13.01.1989 issued by the Council of the respondent-Institute in exercise of powers conferred under Clause (ii) of Part II of Second Schedule to the 1949 Act. It was highlighted that said Notification brought a restriction of the exact nature, function and importantly, restrictive effect wherein a ceiling limit of thirty tax audits was imposed under Section 44AB of the IT Act, 1961. The petitioners have placed most significant reliance on the fact that the said Notification was quashed and held to be ultra vires the Constitution by a of the Madras High Court dated 13.07.1998 in Writ Petition (C) No.5925 of 1989 and the same was affirmed by a Division Bench of the same Court. 4.10 The contention is that the respondent-Institute issued impugned Guidelines dated 08.08.2008 during the pendency of the challenge to the Madras High Court before this Court, solely to negate the binding dictum of of the Madras High Court. Neither was any permission of this Court sought by respondent-Institute nor was this Court informed on 01.04.2013 that new Guidelines were of identical nature as the Notification impugned therein. Importantly, the argument of the petitioners is that the respondent-Institute could not have issued notices or instituted disciplinary proceedings, as doing so would be in teeth of the dictum laid by the Madras High Court which had not been reversed on merits by this Court. Reliance was placed by learned counsel for the petitioners on Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd. vs. Union of India, (2004) 6 SCC 254 (“Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd.”), to contend that when the Madras High Court had quashed an identical Notification dated 13.01.1989, the same was in effect throughout the territory of India. It was held in Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd. as under: 810 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “22. The Court must have the requisite territorial jurisdiction. An passed on a writ petition questioning the constitutionality of a parliamentary Act, whether interim or final keeping in view the provisions contained in clause (2) of Article 226 of the Constitution of India, will have effect throughout the territory of India subject of course to the applicability of the Act.” 4.11 Challenge to procedural impropriety in issuance of the impugned Guidelines was also advanced by the petitioners. It was highlighted that impugned Guidelines were not issued in compliance with provisions of the 1949 Act as the Regulations made by the Council of the respondent-Institute were not notified in the official Gazette of India and despite the requirements of Section 30B of the Act, Impugned Guidelines were not laid before both Houses of Parliament.
