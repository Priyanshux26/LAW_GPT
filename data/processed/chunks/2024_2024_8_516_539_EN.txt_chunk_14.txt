The question of regularisation of the services of such employees may have to be considered on merits in the light of the principles settled by this Court in the cases above referred to and in the light of this . In that context, the Union of India, the State Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to regularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but 538 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports not under cover of s of the courts or of tribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are being now employed. The process must be set in motion within six months from this date. We also clarify that regularisation, if any already made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened based on this , but there should be no further bypassing of the constitutional requirement and regularising or making permanent, those not duly appointed as per the constitutional scheme.” 8. In light of the reasons recorded above, this Court finds merit in the appellants’ arguments and holds that their service conditions, as evolved over time, warrant a reclassification from temporary to regular status. The failure to recognize the substantive nature of their roles and their continuous service akin to permanent employees runs counter to the principles of equity, fairness, and the intent behind employment regulations.” (emphasis supplied) 31. As held in Vinod Kumar (supra), “the essence of employment and the rights thereof cannot be merely determined by the initial terms of appointment when the actual course of employment has evolved significantly over time.” 32. This Court fully associates with this principle and finds it wholly applicable in the present case, especially in light of the administrative s and Board proceedings referred to supra that have consistently treated the appellants as equivalent to regular government employees. The mere classification of employees as ‘temporary’ or ‘permanent’ is not merely a matter of nomenclature but carries significant legal implications, particularly in terms of service benefits and protections. 33. In the present case, the totality of circumstances indicates that despite their formal classification as temporary employees, the appellants’ employment bears substantial hallmarks of regular government [2024] 8 S.C.R. 539 Rajkaran Singh & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. service. The denial of pensionary benefits solely on the basis of their temporary status, without due consideration of these factors, appears to be an oversimplification of their employment relationship with the government. This approach runs the risk of creating a class of employees who, despite serving the government for decades in a manner indistinguishable from regular employees, are deprived of the benefits and protections typically accorded to government servants. 34. Thus, we are of the opinion that the denial of pensionary benefits to the appellants is not tenable or justifiable in the eyes of law as the same is arbitrary and violates the fundamental rights as guaranteed by Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
