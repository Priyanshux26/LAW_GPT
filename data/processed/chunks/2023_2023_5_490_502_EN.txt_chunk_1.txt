[Para 6.3][501-E-G] C 2. Now, so far as the appeals preferred by the original writ petitioners against the impugned and passed by the Division Bench of the High Court restricting the benefit of DCA at Rs.533/- per day from January, 2020, is concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that no cogent reasons have D been assigned by the Division Bench of the High Court to restrict the benefit of Rs.533/- per day from January, 2020 instead of 10.11.2016. Even otherwise, it is required to be noted that this Court as such delivered in the case of Grah Rakshak as far back in the month of March, 2015 and a further clarificatory E was passed on 04.05.2016. Even thereafter the Director General recommended on 10.11.2016 to pay DCA at Rs.533/- per day which was in consonance with the decision of this Court in the case of Grah Rakshak and the subsequent clarificatory dated 04.05.2016. Therefore, the Division Bench of the High F Court is not justified in restricting the benefit of the DCA at Rs.533/- per day from January, 2020. However, at the same time considering the fact that there were 17765 Home Guards working and even as observed by the Commander General / Director General in its recommendation dated 10.11.2016, there will be a financial implication of Rs.51,78,775/- on the Government per G day towards payment of DCA at Rs.293/- per day (Rs.533 – Rs.240) and the annual financial implication would come to Rs.189 Crores if they are engaged 365 days a year and taking into consideration such a huge financial burden, the court directs to H 492 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A restrict the benefit of DCA at Rs.533/- per day from the date of filing of the writ petition before the learned Single Judge which would be from 01.06.2018.
