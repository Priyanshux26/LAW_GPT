In Union of India v. Ashish Agarwal,29 this Court held that it was “in complete agreement with the view taken by various High Courts in holding” that “the benefit of the new provisions shall be made available even in respect of the proceedings relating to past assessment years, provided Section 148 notice has been issued on or after 1-4-2021.” However, the Court observed that the Revenue issued the reassessment notices under a “bona fide belief that the amendments may not yet have been enforced.” This Court exercised its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 142 in to balance the interests of the Revenue and the assesses and directed that the reassessment notices issued under the old regime shall be deemed to have been issued under Section 148-A(b) of the new regime. This Court issued the following directions: 25 See: Ashok Kumar Agarwal v. Union of India, 2021 SCC OnLine All 799; Vellore Institute of Technology v.
