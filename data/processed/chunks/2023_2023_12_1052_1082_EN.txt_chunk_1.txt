[Para 25] Companies Act, 1956 – ss.529A, 530 – Non-obstante nature of s.529A: Held: In view of the non-obstante nature of s.529A of the Companies Act, notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of the Companies Act or any other law for the time being in force on 24.05.1985, on winding up of a company, the debt due to the workmen and the debt due to secured creditors as specifi ed, rank pari passu and are to be paid 1054 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. in the manner prescribed therein in priority to all other debts – Provisions of s.529A of the Companies Act prevail over s.530 of the Companies Act – s.529A of the Companies Act, a non-obstante provision, is to be given primacy in case of confl ict, and consequently, in case of disharmony, this section will override the discordant provisions of the Companies Act and all other enactments in force and the debts are to be paid in terms of s.529A. [Paras 8, 10 and 11] Companies Act, 1956 – s.530(1)(a) – debts ‘due’ in the fi rst portion of clause (a) to s.530(1) and the words ‘become due and payable within the twelve months next before that date’ in the latter portion – Interpretation: Held: The words debt ‘due’ occurring in the fi rst part and the words debt ‘due and payable’ in the latter part of s.530(1)(a) of the Companies Act are diff erent expressions meant to convey diff erent and not the same meaning – Therefore, for a government debt to be covered under clause (a) to s.530(1), it must not only be a debt ‘due’, but it must also be a debt ‘due and payable’ within twelve months next before the relevant date – The requirements of the latter portion of clause (a) to s.530(1) are dual and cumulative, which is debt ‘due and payable’, and not one that is ‘due’ – The debt ‘due’ must have become payable at any time within twelve months next before the relevant date – The debt ‘due and payable’ prior to twelve months next to the relevant date is not a preferential debt in terms of s.530(1)(a) – Such debt will rank pari passu with ordinary or unsecured creditors, without any preferential treatment. [Paras 18] Companies Act, 1956 – s.530(8)(c) - ‘relevant date’: Held: As per sub-clause (i) to clause (c) to sub-Section (8) to s.530, the ‘relevant date’ in case where a company has been ed to be wound up compulsorily, shall be the date of appointment or fi rst appointment of a provisional liquidator, or if no such appointment is made, the date of the winding up , unless the company had commenced to be wound up voluntarily before that date – The present case is one of compulsory winding up and, therefore, the ‘relevant date’, in the absence of appointment of a provisional liquidator, would be the date on which the winding up was passed against the Company, 01.12.2003.
