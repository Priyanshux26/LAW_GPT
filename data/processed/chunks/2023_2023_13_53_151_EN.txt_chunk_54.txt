73. The Telangana High Court’s is in four parts. It takes the view as under: a. That amended Section 13(8) does not take away the right of redemption under Section 60 of the Act 1882 and for this proposition reliance was placed on the decisions in Concern Readymix (supra) and S. Karthik (supra). (Paras 37-40) b. Shakeena (supra) would not apply as it considered a litigation prior to the amendment to Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act and as such the observations made in it regarding the amended Section 13(8) were obiter dicta. Furthermore because S. Karthik (supra) is a subsequent decision of a three-Judge Bench, thus, Shakeena (supra) cannot be relied upon. (Paras 42-43) c. It placed reliance on Section 37 of SARFAESI Act which clarifi es that the provisions of the SARFAESI Act or the Rules made thereunder shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other 128 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. law for the time being in force. Thus, the amended Section 13(8) does not exclude the application of Section 60 of the Act 1882. (Paras 44 and 46) d. Right to property is a constitutional right and such an interpretation of the amended section 13(8) subserves the said constitutional right. (Para 50) 74. We are of the view that each of the foundation of the is incorrect for the following reasons: a. The reliance on S. Karthik (supra) is misplaced because:- (i) Amme Srisailam’s case relies on S. Karthik (supra) to overcome Shakeena’s case on the ground that the latter deals with the unamended s. 13(8). Interestingly the same point also applies to S. Karthik (supra). A careful reading of the facts in S. Karthik (supra) in Para 3-26 clearly indicates that the sale auction notice and the auction in the said case took place in the year 2012. Para 59 of S. Karthik (supra) clinches the issue on the said score as this Court has limited its examination to the validity of the fi rst sale notice dated 21.01.2012 i.e., the auction that took place before amendment of Section 13(8): “59. It can thus be seen that the properties at Items ‘B’ and ‘C’ in the schedule of properties in fi rst sale notice dated 21-1-2012 have been sold through a private treaty, and as such, the said sales are not impugned in the present appeals. It is only the properties at Items ‘A’ and ‘D’ in the schedule of properties in fi rst sale notice dated 21-1- 2012, which have been sold consequent to second sale notice dated 9-7-2012 by public auction in favour of the auction-purchaser, are impugned. We will therefore have to examine the correctness of the submission that since the second sale notice dated 9-7-2012 provided for a period of only 10 days, the auction-sale held on 20-7-2012 is vitiated in view of the law laid down by this Court in Mathew Varghese [Mathew Varghese v. M. Amritha Kumar, (2014) 5 SCC 610 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 254] .
