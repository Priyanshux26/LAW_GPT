5 on 11.08.2023. The statements of the appellant were recorded on 03.08.2023, 04.08.2023, 11.08.2023, 12.08.2023, 14.08.2023, 15.08.2023 and 30.08.2023. 22. The question that arises is when a person is in judicial custody/custody in another case investigated by the same Investigating Agency, whether the statements recorded (in this case the statements dated 03.08.2023, 04.08.2023, 11.08.2023) for a new case in which his arrest is not yet shown, and which are claimed to contain incriminating material against the maker, would be admissible under Section 50? 23. In Vijay Madanlal Choudhary (supra), addressing the scope of Section 50, following has been held:- “159….However, if his/her statement is recorded after a formal arrest by the ED official, the consequences of Article 20(3) or Section 25 of the Evidence Act may come into play to urge that the same being in the nature of confession, shall not be proved against him.’ (Emphasis supplied) The three-judge Bench in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary (supra) has apart from Article 20(3) also adverted to Section 25 of the Evidence Act. Section 25 of the Evidence Act reads as under:- 972 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “25. Confession to police officer not to be proved.- No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence. 24. Vijay Madanlal Choudhary (supra) though held that the authorities under the PMLA are not police officers, did anticipate a scenario where in a given case, the protection of Section 25 of the Evidence Act may have to be made available to the accused. The Court observed that such situations will have to be examined on a case- to-case basis. We deem it appropriate to extract Para 172 of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary (supra). “172. In other words, there is stark distinction between the scheme of the NDPS Act dealt with by this court in Tofan Singh (supra) and that in the provisions of the 2002 Act under consideration. Thus, it must follow that the authorities under the 2002 Act are not police officers. Ex-consequenti, the statements recorded by the authorities under the 2002 Act, of persons involved in the commission of the offence of money-laundering or the witnesses for the purposes of inquiry/investigation, cannot be hit by the vice of article 20(3) of the Constitution or for that matter, article 21 being procedure established by law. In a given case, whether the protection given to the accused who is being prosecuted for the offence of money-laundering, of section 25 of the Evidence Act is available or not, may have to be considered on case-to-case basis being rule of evidence.” (Emphasis supplied) 25. This Court in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary (supra) anticipated the myriad situations that may arise in the recording of the Section 50 statement and discussed the parameters for dealing with them. In Rajaram Jaiswal vs. State of Bihar, AIR 1964 SC 828, a quoted in extenso in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary (supra), this Court observed that the expression “police officer “ in Section 25 of the Evidence Act is not confined to persons who are members of the regularly constituted police force.
