It would then accordingly follow that if an institution was established and administered by minorities as on 26.01.1950, such an institution would be entitled to seek protection under Article 30. 109. We cannot therefore accept the Respondent’s contention that the Appellant’s claim should be disallowed merely because Article 30 did not exist at the time AMU was established. Applying such an interpretation would be absurd and legally unjust. While certain institutions might have been set up during the pre-Constitutional era, the Court cannot turn a blind eye to their rights that are duly protected by the Constitution. 65 SEBI v. Rajkumar Nagpal (2023) 8 SCC 274, para 98-102. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1815 Aligarh Muslim University v. Naresh Agarwal & Ors. 110. In this regard and especially in the context of Article 30, we find more than adequate support from a five-judge bench decision of this Court in Right Rev. Bishop S.K. Patro v. State of Bihar,66 which relied on the opinion proffered by the seven-judge bench in Kerala Education Bill (supra) and held: “7. […] The guarantee of protection under Article 30 is not restricted to educational institutions established after the Constitution: institutions which had been established before the Constitution and continued to be administered by minorities either based on religion or language qualify for the protection of the right of minorities declared by Article 30 of the Constitution. In Re the Kerala Education Bill, 1957 [(1959) SCR 995] Das, C.J., observed at p. 1051: “There is no reason why the benefit of Article 30(1) should be limited only to educational institutions established after the commencement of the Constitution. The language employed in Article 30(1) is wide enough to cover both pre-constitution and post-constitution institutions. It must not be overlooked that Article 30(1) gives the minorities two rights, namely, (a) to establish, and (b) to administer, educational institutions of their choice. The second right clearly covers pre-constitution schools just as Article 26 covers the right to maintain pre-constitution religious institutions.” [Emphasis supplied] 111. In conclusion, while Fundamental Rights cannot be applied retrospectively to disrupt pre-constitutional practices, the Appellant is not barred from asserting a claim under Article 30 as long as the necessary conditions of this provision are met. Individuals or institutions who qualify to be protected through a Fundamental Right as of 26.01.1950 are entitled to enforce these rights under Article 32. Therefore, the Appellant’s locus standi cannot be dismissed on this basis. 66 Right Rev. Bishop S.K. Patrov. State of Bihar (1969) 1 SCC 863 1816 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 112. In addressing the issue of locus, two more key questions arise: (i) whether a small group of individuals from a community can bring a claim under Article 30, as opposed to requiring the entire community to assert the claim collectively? ; and (ii) whether the Muslim community in the present case were presumed to be a ‘minority’ at the time AMU was established? Each of these points are analysed separately below. G.2. Locus of individuals from the minority community 113.
