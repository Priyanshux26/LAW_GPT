15. From the afore-stated state of aff airs, it appears that the extension of time granted by the court vide the dated 12.05.2020, which was self-limiting, had lapsed or expired at least by 30.04.2022 as per the version of the Appellant Bank. Thereafter, there was no passed by the court specifi cally extending the time limit. Signifi cantly, there is no clarifi cation made by the Applicant M/s. Sunview Assets Pvt. Ltd., as to how the deposit of Rs.34,41,50,000/- on 22.07.2022 and the deposit of Rs.7,17,02,859.45/- on 26.08.2022 made with the Appellant Bank were in due compliance of the s passed by the Court from time to time and particularly of the dated 12.05.2020. When the Court had passed the on 12.05.2020 extending the time to deposit the remaining amount till two months after lifting of the lockdown and to pay interest at the lending rate for the period starting from 20.03.2020 till the date of the deposit, it was incumbent on the part of the Applicant to state as to when exactly the lockdown was lifted, what was the lending rate of interest at the relevant time, and how much amount the Applicant was required to pay towards the balance sale price and towards the interest for the period starting from 20.03.2020 till the deposit was made. 16. Even if a lenient view is taken considering the s passed by this Court in the Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) No.3 of 2020 that the period of limitation had stood extended upto February, 2022 on account of the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, then also the Applicant was required to make deposit of the entire balance amount with interest within two months thereafter as per the passed by this Court on 12.05.2020 in M.A. No.922 of 2020, which the Applicant had failed to comply. 680 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. 17. The submission of the learned Senior Advocate Mr. Dushyant Dave for the Applicant that this Court should treat the deposits made by the Applicant on 22.07.2022 and on 26.08.2022 as due compliance of the dated 12.05.2020, extending the time limit by exercising the inherent powers of the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India or exercising the powers conferred on the court under Section 148 of the Civil Procedure Code, cannot be accepted in view of the statutory provision contained in Rule 9 of the said Rules. As per the sub-Rule (4) of Rule 9, the balance amount of purchase price payable has to be paid by the purchaser to the authorized offi cer on or before the fi fteenth day of the confi rmation of sale or such extended period as may be agreed upon in writing between the purchaser and the secured creditor, in any case not extending three months. Even if by liberal construction of the said sub rule, and in view of the s passed by this Court from time to time in the successive applications fi led by the Applicant, it is presumed that the time to deposit the balance amount with interest had stood extended two months after February, 2022, i.e., upto 30.04.2022, no further extension of time as such was granted by the Court nor was it permissible to extend under the said statutory provision contained in Rule 9 of the said rules.
