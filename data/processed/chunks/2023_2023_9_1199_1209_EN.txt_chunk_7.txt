Therefore, citing the table of E punishments listed under the Schedule appended to Regulation 448 to urge that for absence without leave or for overstaying leave, the normal punishment being rigorous imprisonment for three years or less to be undergone in military custody, punishment of dismissal from service could not have been inflicted on the appellant by the SCM, is unacceptable. F Sufficient discretion vests in the SCM to inflict a higher punishment in the given facts and circumstances of a case. Same is the position under Sections 72 and 73 of the Act. Both the sections leave it to the discretion of the Court Martial to award a particular punishment, depending on the nature and degree of the offence. There is no merit in the submission made by learned counsel for the appellant that the said provisions are G not applicable to a SCM. 17. For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any infirmity in the impugned passed by the AFT. The appellant had been taking too many liberties during his service and despite several punishments awarded to him earlier, ranging from imposition of fine to rigorous H EX SEPOY MADAN PRASAD v. UNION OF INDIA AND 1209 OTHERS [HIMA KOHLI, J.] imprisonment, he did not mend his ways. This was his sixth infraction A for the very same offence. Therefore, he did not deserve any leniency by infliction of a punishment lesser than that which has been awarded to him. 18. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed as meritless, while upholding the impugned . The parties are left to bear their own B costs. Ankit Gyan Appeal dismissed.
