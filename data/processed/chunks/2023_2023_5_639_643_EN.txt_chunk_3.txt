In our opinion, the concurrent view taken by the CERC & D APTEL cannot be said to be a view taken in ignorance of the mandatory statutory provisions nor can it be said that it is based on extraneous consideration. The view also cannot be said to be ex-facie arbitrary or illegal. As such, no interference would be warranted in the present appeal. 14. In the result, the appeal is dismissed. Pending application(s), if E any, shall stand disposed of. No costs. Divya Pandey Appeal dismissed. (Assisted by : Roopanshi Virang, LCRA) F G 2 2023 SCC OnLine SC 233 H
