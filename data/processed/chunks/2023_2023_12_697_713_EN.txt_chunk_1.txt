(NPD) (MD) No. 1342 of 2007, by which the revision of the plaintiff -respondent was allowed, the dated 20.12.2006 passed by the court of First Additional Sub Court, Tirunelveli in I.A. No. 207 of 2001 in O.S. No. 276 of 1992 was set aside, I.A. No. 207 of 2001 was allowed and the decree dated 21.11.1996 passed in O.S. No. 276 of 1992 was modifi ed. Factual Matrix 3. The respondent instituted an Original Suit (in short, “O.S.”) No. 276 of 1992 for declaring her as the exclusive owner of the property described in the second schedule of the plaint. Additionally, possession of the said property was sought. In the alternative, it was prayed that, if the court concludes that she is not the exclusive owner of the property, her share therein be declared one-sixth and the same be partitioned accordingly. 4. The plaint case is that,-- the suit property was of plaintiff’s grandmother Fathima Beevi, which the plaintiff purchased from her vide sale-deed dated 14.11.1990; the fi rst defendant (i.e., the appellant no.1) is the daughter-in-law of Fathima Beevi whereas defendant nos. 2 to 6 are her children; taking advantage of staying with Fathima Beevi, the husband of the fi rst defendant, namely, Khaja Mohideen, got a gift-deed executed in his favour from Fathima Beevi on 24.04.1982; the said gift-deed was obtained by exercising undue infl uence and coercion and was never acted upon and is therefore a nullity. In the alternative, it was pleaded that, if the gift-deed is accepted, since the husband of the fi rst defendant died on 31.05.1988 (i.e., before the death of his mother Fathima Beevi), Fathima Beevi had 700 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. one-sixth share in the property which would come to the plaintiff under the sale-deed dated 14.11.1990. 5. The appellants, who were defendants in the suit, contested the suit on various grounds. On the pleadings of the parties, inter alia, following issues came up for consideration: (i) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to ownership and possession of the entire second schedule property or only a one-sixth share therein?
