The respondent was working as an Executive Engineer in the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board, Mandya Division, Mandya during the period 1983 to 2007. On the basis of the Source Report dated 17.12.2007 submitted by the then Deputy Superintendent of Police, Bengaluru Rural Division, Karnataka Lokayukta, Bengaluru, a case being Crime No. 22 of 2007 (later numbered as Crime No. 62 of 2008) came to be registered against the respondent for the off ence under Section 13(1)(e) read with Section 13(2) of the said Act. It was alleged, inter alia, that the respondent- accused during his tenure in the offi ce as an Executive Engineer had amassed the wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income. On the completion of the investigation, the Investigating Offi cer had sent the papers to the State Government seeking sanction to prosecute the respondent as required in Section 19(1) of the said Act. The Government of Karnataka on the basis of the material placed before it, had accorded the requisite sanction by issuing the Government dated 13.09.2010. Thereafter the chargesheet came to be fi led in the Court of Principal District and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru Rural District at Bengaluru wherein it was alleged that respondent had abused his position as a public servant, had indulged into corrupt practices and had amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income. The said case was registered as Special Case No. 488 of 2011 before the said Court. 3. The respondent-accused fi led an application under Section 227 read with 239 of CrPC on 12.10.2011, seeking his discharge from the STATE OF KARNATAKA LOKAYUKTA POLICE v. 23 S. SUBBEGOWDA [BELA M. TRIVEDI, J.] case contending, inter alia, that neither the contents of the Source Report nor the other documents constituted any off ence as alleged, and that the sanction under Section 19(1) of the said Act was issued by the Government without any application of mind. The said application came to be dismissed by the trial court by passing a detailed on 01.02.2013. Being aggrieved by the said , the respondent preferred a Criminal Revision Petition being no. 287 of 2013 before the High Court. The said petition came to be disposed of by the High Court vide the dated 05.07.2013 directing the trial court to consider the documents made available by the respondent during the investigation and produced by the prosecution with the chargesheet, while framing the charge without being infl uenced by the dated 01.12.2013. 4. It appears that in view of the said passed by the High Court, the respondent-accused again fi led an application under Sections 227 and 239 of CrPC before the trial court seeking his discharge from the case by contending, inter alia, that the sanction passed by the Government lacked application of mind and was given mechanically and that the Investigating Offi cer had suppressed the material produced by the respondent off ering satisfactory explanations to the assets acquired, income derived and expenditure incurred by the respondent during period in question.
