In K. Sudheesh Kumar (supra), this Court had specifically dealt with Clause 8.1 of the MACPS and observed that the next financial 1 For short, “MACPS.” 2 (2020) 5 SCC 421. 3 For short, “ACP.” 4 CCS RP Rules. 5 (2021) 5 SCC 579. 6 (2022) 3 SCC 649. 7 (2022) SCC OnLine SC 1058. 1522 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports upgradation in terms of Section 1, Part-A of the First Schedule to the CCS RP Rules, was from Pay Band8-2 with Grade pay of ₹5400 to PB-3 with Grade Pay of ₹5400. The argument that the pay-scale and the Grade Pay of ₹5400 was common was rejected in view of the clear stipulation in Clause 8.1 of the MACPS. The effect thereof would be that a person given financial upgradation under the MACPS from PB-2 with Grade Pay of ₹5400 to PB-3 with Grade Pay of ₹5400 will be entitled to an increment at the rate of 3%. 7. In the case of Ex.HC/GD Virender Singh (supra), the issue which had arisen was as to whether the MACPS was applicable and was to be implemented with effect from 01.01.2006, the date on which the CCS RP Rules, were enforced or was to be applied, in terms of O.M. dated 19.05.2009. 8. Ex.HC/GD Virender Singh (supra), observes that the MACPS would be applicable with effect from 01.09.2008. Upon considering the reasoning in M.V. Mohanan Nair (supra), it was held that the earlier decision of this Court in “Union of India and others v. Balbir Singh Turn and another”,9 was effectively overruled. It is relevant to refer to this settled position, as the arguments in the present cases primarily arise from the fact that the CCS RP Rules were enforced with effect from 01.01.2006 and granted certain benefits to the respondents in the form of revision or higher pay scales after completion of two or four years of service, as the case may be. 9. Ex.HC/GD Virender Singh (supra), following M.V. Mohanan Nair (supra) reiterated that under the MACPS, the eligible Government employees are entitled to financial upgradation equivalent to the immediate next Grade Pay in the hierarchy of the Pay Bands, as stated in Section 1, Part-A of the First Schedule to the CCS RP Rules. 10. In the present case, upon implementation of the CCS RP Rules, some of the respondents who were working as Pharmacists in the Ordnance Factory, and the others, who were working as Superintendents in the Central Board of Excise, became entitled to non-functional upgradation, on completion of two or four years of service respectively, in PB-2 with Grade Pay of ₹4200 and PB-2 8 For short, “PB”. 9 (2018) 11 SCC 99. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1523 Union of India & Ors. v. N.M. Raut & Ors. with Grade Pay of ₹5400 respectively. The earlier pay scale, before the grant of non-functional financial upgradation, was with the Grade Pay of ₹2800 and ₹4800 respectively. 11. In to appreciate the controversy, we would refer to the factual position in the case of Devendra Saxena, one of the respondents before us: o He was appointed as an Inspector in the service on 16.09.1982.
