s.162 of the 1967 Act – On the allegations of raising funds for a terrorist act, there are mere third-party allegations that money has been directed to be sent to her – None of the materials reveal receipt of any funds by her or her direct role in raising or collecting funds – As regards the allegation against the appellant for committing an offence u/s. 184 of the 1967 Act are concerned, the materials collected so far, only reveal her participation in some meetings and her attempt to encourage women to join the struggle for new democratic revolution – These allegations, prima facie, do not reveal the commission of an offence u/s. 18 of the 1967 Act – There are no specific materials or statements produced by the prosecution which attribute acts of recruitment in banned organization by the appellant – Evidence of her involvement in any fund-raising activities for the CPI (Maoist) or her support to the said organisation has not transpired through any reliable evidence at this stage – Mere meeting of accused individuals or being connected with them through any medium cannot implicate one in Chapter VI offences under of the 1967 Act, in the absence of any further evidence of being associated with a terrorist organisation – On perusal of the evidences collected against her as also the allegations made by prosecution witnesses, there is no reasonable ground for believing that the accusations against the appellants for commission of the offences incorporated 272 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
