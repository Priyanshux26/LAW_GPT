We say so for the following reasons:- (i) Firstly, the original Complaint No. 515 was filed on 11.06.2009 when the Insurance Company had not taken any decision on the claim. H ASHOK KUMAR v. NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. 1251 [K. V. VISWANATHAN, J.] In fact, the Complainant had alleged that the Insurance Company was A lingering on with the issue and had complained of not rendering “sufficient service”; (ii) Secondly, pending that complaint, it was on 15.10.2009 that the repudiation letter was issued on purported breach of Condition Nos. 1 & 5 of the Policy; B (iii) Thirdly, we find that a separate proceeding has been drawn up recording the statement of only the lawyer of the Complainant. The statement of the lawyer stated that “I, Surender Kumar Gulia, Advocate, state that I do not want to proceed with my case. It may be dismissed”. C (iv) Fourthly, in the complaint filed on 06.03.2012, the appellant avers that since the lawyer for the opposite party – Insurance Company was taking numerous dates for arguments, his counsel getting annoyed with the attitude of the advocate of the opposite party withdrew the above said case by mistake. D (v) Fifthly, the appellant further avers that the withdrawal was unfortunate and he ought not to have prejudiced for the deeds of his lawyer. (vi) Sixthly, the finding of the National Commission is also factually erroneous, on this score. The learned counsel for the appellant drew our E attention to para 9 of the of the National Commission wherein the following erroneous finding was recorded. “9. It is not disputed that earlier also, the complainant had filed consumer complaint no. 515 of 2009 against the opposite party/ Insurance company on the same cause of action. Perusal of record F would show that aforesaid complaint filed by the complainant in respect of repudiation of insurance claim regarding the same theft was withdrawn by the complainant unconditionally on 22.11.2010. Copy of the relevant in CC No. 515 of 2009 is on the record. The is reproduced as under: G “Statement of learned counsel for the complainant for withdrawal of the complaint recorded separately. In view of the statement, the complaint of the complainant is hereby dismissed as withdrawn. File be consigned to record room after due compliance.” H 1252 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A It will be noticed that the National Commission was under the wrong impression that the original Complaint No. 515 of 2009 was filed in respect of repudiation of the insurance claim and it proceeded on the erroneous premise that having challenged the repudiation in Complaint No. 515, the withdrawal of the complaint unconditionally on 22.11.2010 was fatal to the appellant. The original Complaint No. 515 of 2009 was B filed on 11.06.2009 and the respondent-Insurance Company repudiated the claim only on 15.10.2009. 8) In view of the foregoing, it has to be reiterated that the complaint No. 515 was filed after theft due to non-settlement of claim by the Insurance Company.
