On account of the third wave of Pandemic, the aforementioned dated 23.09.2021 was finally modified on 10.01.2022, with a total period of approximately 716 days between 15.03.2020-28.02.2022 being excluded from the operation of limitation.45 44. The respondents submit that the s of this Court passed by this Court from time to time as referred to above, would not come to the aid of the appellants since these s saved only those actions and proceedings which were within the period of limitation as on 15.03.2020. They contended that the aforementioned s ought not to be construed in a manner to resuscitate actions and proceedings that were time-barred before the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. If the limitation period had already expired before the pandemic, such cases could not take shelter behind the general relief granted by this Court in In Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation (supra). The respondents buttressed their arguments by relying upon Sagufa Ahmed v. Upper Assam Plywood Products (P) Ltd.46 45. Sagufa Ahmed (supra) construed that the s passed In Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation (supra) were intended to benefit vigilant litigants who were prevented due to the pandemic and the lockdown, from initiating proceedings within the period of limitation prescribed by general or special law. We respectfully agree with the view taken in Sagufa Ahmed (supra). Consequently, the benefit of In Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation (supra) 43 2021 SCC Online SC 373, para 6-7. 44 2021 SCC Online SC 947, para 8. 45 (2022) 3 SCC 117, para 5. 46 [2020] 9 SCR 472 : (2021) 2 SCC 317, para 17. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1255 Delhi Development Authority v. Tejpal & Ors. can be availed by the appellants only in a case where the period of limitation expired between 15.03.2020 and 28.02.2022. D.5. Supreme Court frowning upon the filing of fresh SLPs 46. In addition to the above grounds, the appellants claim that they were unable to file the appeals before Shailendra (supra) came as this Court was discouraging them from filing fresh SLPs by dismissing such petitions in limine and imposing heavy costs. 47. We are not inclined to accept the above stated plea as a good ground to condone the delay. Even if the appellants’ contention is believed to be true that some of the SLPs were dismissed on the strength of the then governing law as laid down in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra)), this could not be an impediment for filing SLPs on time. Had it been so, this Court would not have had the opportunity to reconsider Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association (supra). That apart, some of the cases which are part of this batch were filed before Shailendra (supra), which belies the appellants’ stance. Instead, it is likely that the appellants took a careful, considered and conscious call of not agitating their claims as they perceived their chances of success to be bleak. D.6. Public interest and justice 48. As a final contention, the appellants have sought this Court’s indulgence asserting ‘public interest’ and the ‘larger cause of justice’.
