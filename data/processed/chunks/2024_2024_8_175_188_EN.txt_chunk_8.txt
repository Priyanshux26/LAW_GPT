However, this Court clarified that there would be a segregation as the two cadres would remain, which is indicative of a difference between the two. Ipso facto, benefits accorded to one would not accrue to the other unless so specified in the relevant Scheme, as may be framed by the employer i.e., State Government/University. 25. Accordingly, for the reasons aforesaid, these appeals succeed; the s in question, passed by the learned Single Judge and affirmed by the Division Bench, are set aside. It is held that the writ petitioners/ [2024] 8 S.C.R. 187 Rajasthan Agricultural University, Bikaner, Through Its Registrar v. Dr. Zabar Singh Solanki and Ors. private respondents are not entitled to benefits under the CAS, as notified by the Government of India vide Letter dated 22.07.1988. 26. Needless to state, if the two cadres are given exactly similar benefits under s of the Court, then it would amount to doing something indirectly which cannot be done directly. Moreover, this was substantially negated in the earlier round of litigation, referred to above. 27. We may however clarify that to direct for any recovery of monies which may have already been disbursed to the Respondents No.1 to 54 would amount to inequity at this late stage. Hence, the same shall not be recovered, but all the pay and emoluments for the purposes of retiral/service conditions and for post-retiral benefits shall be reckoned notionally without granting any benefit under the CAS. Assuming that the respondents are otherwise entitled to any benefit under any other Scheme/Policy, it is directed that the State Government or the appellant will not deprive the respondents thereof by virtue of the instant alone. 28. The Civil Appeals arising from SLP (C) Nos.22278/2011 and 22813/2011 are disposed of in the above fashion. 29. Onto the Civil Appeal arising from SLP (C) No.30963/2018, which traces its genesis to the dated 04.05.2018, passed by the Division Bench. This was tagged with SLP (C) No.22813/2011 by dated 30.11.2018 of this Court. In this case, respondents No.1 to 9, before their regular appointment as Assistant Professors in the University, served on an ad-hoc basis in other educational institutions and also in the University. These respondents preferred a writ petition with a prayer to reckon their services rendered in such ad-hoc capacity while determining their eligibility for the grant of senior pay-scale under the CAS. The relief claimed was granted by the learned Single Judge and affirmed by the Division Bench relying on the in State of Rajasthan v Milap Chand Jain, (2013) 14 SCC 562. This Court, while disposing of Milap Chand Jain (supra), relied on its earlier dated 10.03.2011 in Civil Appeal No.469/2007 entitled State of Rajasthan v Dr Suresh Chand Agrawal, which was dismissed in limine, leaving the question of law open. Review Petitions (Civil) No.2124-2125/2011 filed in Dr Suresh Chand Agrawal (supra) were also dismissed by this Court on 14.09.2011. In Milap Chand Jain (supra), the State of Rajasthan 188 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports had moved this Court in respect of the same impugned therein, against which appeals stood previously dismissed by this Court.
