CONCLUSION ...................................................................... 120* 1. I have had the benefit of reading a very erudite penned by my learned brother, Justice Surya Kant – holding Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (“the Citizenship Act”) to be constitutionally valid. However, with all humility at my command, I beg to differ with the views expressed by Justice Surya Kant on certain issues. 2. I have examined the matter from a different dimension, more particularly by applying the doctrine of temporal reasonableness. I propose to hold Section 6A of the Citizenship Act invalid with prospective effect, for the reasons I shall assign hereinafter in my . 3. However, before I proceed to express my views, I would like to highlight a few salient features of the penned by Justice Surya Kant. I. SALIENT FEATURES OF THE PENNED BY JUSTICE SURYA KANT. 4. Justice Surya Kant, in his , after giving an overview of the jurisprudence regarding the concept of citizenship and the associated statutory framework in India and various other international jurisdictions, has framed and discussed twelve issues. The first two issues are preliminary in nature and deal with the scope and extent of judicial review and the applicability of doctrine of delay and laches to the present case. The remaining ten issues pertain to the various challenges to the constitutionality of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act as raised by the Petitioners. 5. In the present , I have dealt with the issues pertaining to the manifest arbitrariness and temporal unreasonableness of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act. Hence, I do not deem it appropriate to express [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1149 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 my views on all the issues as framed by Justice Surya Kant in his . I have expressed my concurrence or disagreement, as the case may be, with the views taken by him, only where I deemed it to be completely necessary for the purposes of answering the questions framed by me in this . 6. On the first prefatory issue pertaining to the scope and extent of judicial review, Justice Surya Kant has held that it is well within the domain of this Court to examine the challenges raised by the petitioners against the vires of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act. He has considered and rejected the objections of the respondents that Section 6A, being in the nature of foreign policy, should not be examined on the touchstone of constitutionality.1 7.
