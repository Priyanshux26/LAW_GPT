This Court has also observed that Article 142 of the Constitution of India cannot be used to depart from the substantive law. It was submitted that even if the Auction Purchaser was permitted to take the benefit of the dated 17th November, 2021 passed by the Adjudicating Authority, it could take the last date for deposit upto 23rd July, 2020 whereas, the Auction Purchaser did not deposit the balance sale consideration till 24th August, 2020. 25. Coming next to the submission made by learned senior counsel for the respondents that model timelines for the liquidation process under Regulation 47 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 are directory in character and not mandatory, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the decisions cited by the respondents to substantiate the said submission, are distinguishable on facts. It was contended that this Court has itself held in Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited (supra) that the timelines mentioned in Sections 7(5), 9(5) and 10(4) of the IBC are directory in nature because they do not provide for any consequence if the period so mentioned is exceeded. However, the word used in Rule 12 of Schedule I under Regulation 33 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 is “shall”. The second proviso under 39 (2022) 15 SCC 569 40 [2023] 14 SCR 666 : (2023) 10 SCC 232 41 For short ‘SIE Rules, 2002’ [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1283 V.S. Palanivel v. P. Sriram, CS, Liquidator, Etc. Rule 12 provides for a consequence that in the event the amount is not paid within 90 days, the sale shall be cancelled. The decision in the case of Prakash Chandra Kapoor (supra) is also sought to be distinguished on the same grounds. Learned senior counsel submitted that in all the Rules under Schedule I, except for Rule 11, the word “shall” has been used and it has been held in Vidarbha Industries Power Limited v. Axis Bank Limited,42 that if one provision uses the word “may”, and another provision uses the word “shall”, then wherever the word “shall” has been used, will have to be treated as mandatory. Applying the said principle to the instant case, it was mandatory for the Auction Purchaser to have deposited the balance sale consideration in respect of the auctioned property within 90 days and at the outer date, on or before 23rd of July, 2020 when the period of the lockdown had come to an end. 26. As for the submission made by the Auction Purchaser that the Income Tax attachment was lifted only on 27th August, 2020 and therefore, there was no occasion for it to have paid the balance sale consideration before the attachment was lifted, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the Adjudicating Authority had passed an on 10th February, 2020, directing the Income Tax Department to lift the attachment and the said having been pronounced in open court, ought to have been in the knowledge of the respondents who cannot take a plea that the said was communicated to them much later and therefore, they were oblivious thereto.
