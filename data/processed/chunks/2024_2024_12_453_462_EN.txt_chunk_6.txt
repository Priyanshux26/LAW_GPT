Digital Supreme Court Reports compromise decree as an appeal and fresh suit are not maintainable under the CPC. 15. In view of this legal position, the High Court was not correct in curtailing the statutory remedy available to the appellant in the first place.11 In fact, when there is a statutory remedy available to a litigant, there is no question of a court granting liberty to avail of such remedy as it remains open to the party to work out his remedies in accordance with law.12 Therefore, there was no occasion for the court to deny liberty to file for restoration by its dated 14.07.2022 and the consequent dismissal of the recall application by the impugned on this ground alone does not arise. Further, as a matter of public policy, courts must not curtail statutorily provisioned remedial mechanisms available to parties. 16. It is also relevant that para 4 of the compromise deed dated 18.05.2022 recognises the appellant’s right to file for restoration of appeal in case of non-compliance. Further, para 7 stipulates that the compromise will be considered void in case of non-payment. Reading these clauses together, it is clear that the compromise deed itself recognises the parties’ right to approach the court to question its validity in certain circumstances. These clauses are in line with the public policy consideration of access to justice reflected in Section 28 of the Contract Act that stipulates that agreements which restrain a party from enforcing his rights through legal remedies are void. 17. In this view of the matter, we allow the appeal, set aside the impugned dated 19.10.2023, and remand the matter to the High Court to decide the application for recall on its own merits. Needless to say that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the matter. 18. No as to costs. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain 11 See Bhanu Kumar Jain v. Archana Kumar (2005) 1 SCC 787, paras 28 and 36. 12 See Shiv Shakti Coop. Housing Society, Nagpur v.
