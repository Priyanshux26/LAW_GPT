Till 17.06.2010, there was no entitlement to seek FSI under Regulation 33 for construction of an amenity and the amenity TDR was available only under Regulation 34 read with Para 6 of Appendix-VII. The amendment made on 17.06.2010 to Regulation 33 resulted in the owner, who had constructed the road, instead of TDR, to opt for FSI to be utilized on the remainder of the land. He would then be entitled to an extent of 25% of the FSI. But if the owner constructed an amenity but did not avail FSI benefit on the remainder land, the benefit was separated from the land and given in the form of TDR under Regulation 34 read with Para 6 of Appendix-VII. That Para 6 of Appendix-VII was not amended as such on 17.06.2010 after the decision of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I as no amendment was carried out as such. However, by the notification dated 16.11.2016, the entire Regulation 34 and Appendix-VII were substituted. As per the amended provision, the owner was eligible to obtain TDR for the land at the rate mentioned in Para 4.1 of the amended Regulations as the owner who developed the amenity thereon became eligible to receive TDR in terms of Para 4.2 but by this, Regulation 33(1) did not undergo any amendment. 3.1 It was contended that the aforesaid amendment should be construed to be prospective as otherwise it would apply to cases where amenity was developed and surrendered earlier, and hence would be unconstitutional. It was pointed out that subsequent to the of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I, in the case of Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay vs. Natwar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd., Civil Appeal No.1748 of 2015 (“Natwar Parikh”) this Court had rejected the prayer of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation to revisit the decision in the case of Godrej & Boyce I and had also rejected [2024] 9 S.C.R. 837 Kukreja Construction Company & Others v. State of Maharashtra & Others the prayer for declaring that the said would have only a prospective effect. In the said case, this Court had also rejected an argument of delay and laches. 3.2 It was further contended that the notification dated 16.11.2016 could not have a retrospective effect as the decision of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I could not have been nullified by taking away the vested right conferred, without altering the basis of the . 3.3 It was next contended that clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 126 of the MRTP Act, which was incorporated into the statute book with retrospective effect from 25.03.1991, would imply that prior to the said date, there was no provision for FSI/TDR for construction of a road by the owner. That for the first time w.e.f. 17.06.2010, provision was made for an additional 25% FSI for construction of DP Road. Since a road falls within the definition of amenity under the DCR as well as MRTP Act, compensation in the form of FSI/TDR for the construction of an amenity as provided by the relevant DCR ought to have been granted to the petitioners.
