The advantage is that procedural fairness 75 [1964] A.C 40 76 See In r HK (An Infant), (1967) 1 All ER 226 77 MP Jain & SN Jain, “Principles of Administrative Law” (7th ed. Vol I, LexisNexis) 352 1434 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports can be imposed on a large number of decision-making bodies without having to characterise their functions as quasi-judicial. This approach has resulted in applying hearing procedure to a large chunk of administrative process. The nexus between hearing and quasi-judicial no longer exists in administrative process. This approach does away with the conceptual approach of calling a function as quasi-judicial when not much of judicial element is discernible there. […] The emphasis is now placed on the element of injury to the concerned person by the administrative action in question to concede hearing to the affected person.” (emphasis supplied) 42. In AK Kraipak v. Union of India,78 a Constitution Bench renounced the distinction between quasi-judicial and administrative functions for the purpose of a compliance of the principles of natural justice. Relying on the of the Queen’s Bench Division in In re H.K (An Infant)79 and the constitutional imperative of the rule of law,80 the Constitution Bench held that the principles of natural justice will apply even to administrative decisions.81 The of the Constitution Bench in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India82 has cemented this interpretation.83 78 [1970] 1 SCR 457 : (1969) 2 SCC 262 79 (1967) 2 QB 617; “But at the same time, I myself think that even if an immigration officer is not in a judicial or a quasi-judicial capacity, he must at any rate give the immigrant an opportunity of satisfying him of the matters in the sub-section, and for that purpose let the immigrant know what his immediate impression is so that the immigrant can disabuse him.” In this context, also see the observations of Lord Parker C.J., in Reginal v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board Ex parte Lain (1967) 2 QB 684: “With regard to Mr Bridge’s second point, I cannot think that Atkin L.J., intended to confine his principle to cases in which the determination affected rights in the sense of enforceable rights. Indeed, in the Electricity Commissioners case the rights determined were at any rate not immediately enforceable rights. […] the remedy is available even though the decision is merely a step as a result of which legally enforceable rights may be affected.” 80 [1970] 1 SCR 457 : (1969) 2 SCC 262 [13] 81 “20. […] If the purpose of the rules of natural justice is to prevent miscarriage of justice one fails to see why those rules should be made inapplicable to administrative enquiries. Often times it is not easy to draw the line that demarcates administrative enquiries from quasi-judicial enquires. […] Arriving at a just decision I the aim of both quasi-judicial enquiries as well as administrative enquiries.” [emphasis supplied] 82 [1978] 2 SCR 621 : AIR 1978 SC 597 83 “The law must, therefore, now be taken to be well settled that even in an administrative proceeding, which involved civil consequences, the doctrine of natural justice must be held to be applicable.” Also see SL Kapoor v. Jagmohan, AIR 1981 SC 136 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
