[2024] 12 S.C.R. 2107 M/s Bhagwati Medical Hall & Anr. v. Central Drugs Standard Control Organization & Ors. 5.3. The Respondent authorities rely on the of the District Magistrate and the joint team’s inspections, which purportedly revealed the absence of necessary records and the availability of large stocks without any doctor’s prescription. They contend that their actions are within the powers conferred under Section 22 of the D&C Act, 1940, which allows inspection and necessary steps to prevent offenses under the Act. 5.4. It is the Respondents’ stance that, given the abuse and health ramifications, the High Court’s observation treating the tincture as a prohibited article, at least for practical purposes, does not suffer from legal error. They maintain that public interest and health considerations justify the restrictions imposed on the Appellants’ sale of the tincture, and no interference is warranted. 6. Having carefully considered the arguments advanced by both sides and upon a thorough examination of the materials on record, it is clear that the action taken by the Respondent authorities lacks a sustainable reasoning. 7. The aromatic tincture of cardamom at issue is governed by the D&C Act, 1940 and the rules framed thereunder. Under this statutory framework, the manufacture, sale, and distribution of drugs are subject to a carefully calibrated regulatory regime. The D&C Act, 1940 classifies drugs, prescribes licensing requirements, mandates compliance with quality standards, and delineates the respective powers of Central and State authorities. Crucially, the power to impose a prohibition or to declare a drug as banned or restricted for reasons of public interest lies exclusively with the Central Government, as provided in Section 26A of the D&C Act, 1940, which has been reproduced hereunder: “Section 26A: Powers of Central Government to regulate, restrict or prohibit manufacture, etc., of drug and cosmetic in public interest: Without prejudice to any other provision contained in this Chapter, if the Central Government is satisfied, that the use of any drug or cosmetic is likely to involve any risk to human beings or animals or that any drug does not have the therapeutic value claimed or purported to be claimed for it or contains ingredients and in such quantity for which there is no 2108 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports therapeutic justification and that in the public interest it is necessary or expedient so to do, then, that Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, [regulate, restrict or prohibit] the manufacture, sale or distribution of such drug or cosmetic.” 8. Section 26A of the D&C Act, 1940 empowers the Central Government, if satisfied that the use of any drug involves risk to human beings or animals, or that it lacks the therapeutic value claimed, or that it contains ingredients in a quantity for which there is no therapeutic justification, to regulate, restrict, or prohibit its manufacture, sale, or distribution by a notification in the Official Gazette. This is the sole statutory mechanism through which a drug, previously permissible, can be effectively taken off the market or subjected to special conditions.
