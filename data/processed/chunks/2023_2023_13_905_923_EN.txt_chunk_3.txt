6 Writ Petition No. 21009 of 2012 (cid:0) MANOJ MISRA, J. (cid:1) 910 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. High Court’s Findings 9. The High Court after considering the pleadings and the materials on record, concluded: “Having considered the submissions raised and applying the law laid down by the Apex Court, it is evident that the notice dated 26.02.1979 under section 10(5) of the Act which is said to have been served on 27.02.1979, as has been alleged in paragraph no. 4 of the counter affi davit, the same has been denied by the petitioner, but even assuming the same to be correct, the actual physical possession alleged to have been taken on 08.03.1979 could not be done as the period of 30 days had not expired. Even otherwise the document which has been fi led as Annexure No. 1 to the counter affi davit is a report and not the actual possession memo. It also records that Bashir, who is the father of the petitioner refused to sign on the proceedings while possession was taken and the petitioner was not present at the time. It is, therefore, clear that this was a sheer paper transaction prepared before the expiry of the statutory period of 30 days and if the petitioner had not handed over voluntary possession, the dispossession could have been possible only by complying with the provisions of section 10(6) of 1970 Act. No such procedure has been followed nor any such evidence is on record. It is therefore evident that the case taken in the counter affi davit of having taken over the actual physical possession is not in conformity with law nor actual possession appears to have been taken.” 10. Before concluding as above, the High Court took notice of various judicial pronouncements including of this Court, namely, (a) State of U.P. vs. Hari Ram7; (b) Raghbir Singh Sehrawat vs. State of Haryana and Others8 and (c) State of Assam vs. Bhaskar Jyoti Sarma & Others9. 11. We have heard Mr. Rana Mukherjee, learned senior counsel for the appellants and Mr. Ankur Yadav for the fi rst respondent. 7 (2013) 4 SCC 280 8 (2012) 1 SCC 792 9 (2015) 5 SCC 321 STATE OF U.P. & ANR. v. EHSAN & ANR. 911 Submissions On Behalf Of The Appellants 12. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that notice under Section 10(5) of the Ceiling Act, 1976 was served on the tenure holder on 27.02.1979. Pursuant thereto, possession was taken on 8.3.1979. However, since the original petitioner avoided signing the memorandum of possession, the Competent Authority went to the spot, took possession in presence of two co-sharers and prepared a memorandum to that eff ect. Following that, the name of the State stood entered in the revenue records on 17.3.1982. As such, the land stood vested in the State. Later, it was transferred to Saharanpur Development Authority on 26.5.2003. Consequently, benefi t of the Repeal Act, 1999 is not available to the original petitioner. 13. Appellants’ also questioned the maintainability of the writ petition on the following grounds: (i) There existed a serious dispute between the parties on a pure question of fact (i.e., whether actual possession was taken or not), which could appropriately be decided after taking oral evidence.
