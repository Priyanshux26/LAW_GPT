46. The Investigating Agency have also referred to ECIR No. 4 as a criminal antecedent. A reference was made to ECIR No. 4 of 2022 pertaining to illegal Stone Mining and related activities in Saheb Ganj, Jharkhand, where the petitioner was arrested on 25.08.2022 and the prosecution complaint was filed on 16.09.2022. Insofar as the bail pertaining to ECIR No. 4 of 2022, which is pending in this Court in SLP (Criminal) No. 691 of 2023, at the after notice stage, the merits of the bail in that case will be independently examined. Having examined the facts of the present case arising out of ECIR No. 5 of 2023 and in view of the findings recorded hereinabove, we do not think that the appellant can be denied bail based on the pendency of the other matter. We say so in the facts and circumstances of the present case as we do not find any justification for his continued detention. The appellant has already been in custody for over one year. The Trial is yet to commence. There is a reference to one more ECIR which the Investigating Agency refers to in their counter, namely, ECIR/RNZO/18/2022 but nothing is available from the record as to whether any proceedings have been taken against the appellant. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 983 Prem Prakash v. Union of India Through The Directorate of Enforcement Allegation of misuse of Jail facilities by the Appellant 47. Elaborate contentions have been made on the conduct of the appellant about certain facilities having been extended to him in jail. We do not comment on them and if at all there is any violation of the prison Rules, the Investigating Agency ought to take up with the higher officials of the Jail. On the facts of the present case, they are not reasons enough to deny the appellant his liberty. 48. For the reasons stated above, while allowing the appeal, we set aside the dated 22.03.2024 of the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi in B.A. No. 9863 of 2023. We clarify that the observations made in this are only for the purpose of disposing of the bail application and they shall not influence the Trial Court, which would proceed in accordance with law and on the basis of the evidence on record. Conclusion 49. In the result, we pass the following :- (i) The appeal is allowed and impugned dated 22.03.2024 is quashed and set aside. (ii) The Trial Court is directed to release the appellant on bail in connection with ED Case No. ECIR No. 5 of 2023 on furnishing bail bonds for a sum of Rs. 5 lakh with 2 sureties of the like amount. (iii) The appellant shall surrender his passport with the Trial Court and the appellant shall report to the Investigating Officer on every Monday and Thursday between 10 and 11 A.M. (iv) The appellant shall not make any attempt to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. Pending applications shall stand disposed of.
