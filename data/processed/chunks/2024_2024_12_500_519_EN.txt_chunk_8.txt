Therefore, the ratio therein is of little assistance to the appellant ”.26 15. It is true that the decision in Karmi (supra) neither analysed the provisions of the Act nor has considered the purpose and object of Section 14 and the precedents on this subject. However, the principle on the basis of which the Court in Karmi (supra) decided the case resonates in many subsequent decisions which have in fact followed it as a precedent. 16. A 1996 decision of this Court in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar and Ors. v. Idol of Sri Swaminathaswami Swaminathaswami Thirukoil and Ors27 is important for the reason that it is of a three Judge bench 23 Id no. 5- See para nos. 4 and 9. 24 (1989) 3 SCC 572 25 Id n 6 – See para 10 26 Ibid – See para 29 27 [1996] 1 SCR 1068 : (1996) 8 SCC 525 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 511 Tej Bhan (D) Through Lr. & Ors. v. Ram Kishan (D) Through Lrs. & Ors. and it identifies a discordant note in a subsequent case of a two Judge bench in Gumpha v. Jaibai,28 the court observed that : “28. In Gumpha case though the Will was executed in 1941 and the executor died in 1958 after the Act had come into force, the concept of limited right in lieu of maintenance was very much in the mind of the executor when Will was executed in 1941 but after the Act came into force, the Will became operative. The restrictive covenant would have enlarged it into an absolute estate; but unfortunately the Bench had put a restrictive interpretation which in our considered view does not appear to be sound in law.” 17. The above referred decision in Masilamani Mudaliar (supra) was followed in Bhoomireddy Chenna Reddy v. Bhoospalli Pedda Verrappa29 and V. Kalyanaswamy v. L. Bakthavatsalam, Nazar Singh v. Jagjit Kaur,30 Balwant Kaur (supra), Shakuntala Devi (supra), Santosh & Ors. v. Smt Saraswathibai & Anr,31 Jupudy Pardha Sarathy (supra) as well as the recent, Munni Devi Alias Nathi Devi (D) v. Rajendra Alias Lallu Lal (D)32 and Kallakuri Pattabhiramswamy (D) Through LRs v. Kallakuri Kamaraju & Ors33 are other decisions that have followed Tulsamma (supra). 18. The other stream of thought seems to have originated in a three-Judge bench of this Court in Karmi (supra) about which we have already mentioned. The conclusion in this decision is drawn from a different perspective of statutory construction, elucidation of which is seen in the subsequent decision of this Court in Bhura (supra). However, it is only in Gumpha (supra) that the principle of the alternate thoughts are formulated as under: 1. While qualifying the law relating to intestate succession, to become a complete code, the Act also deals with testamentary succession. In Section 28 [1994] 1 SCR 901 : (1994) 2 SCC 511 29 [1996] Supp. 9 SCR 332 : (1997) 10 SCC 673 30 [1995] Supp. 5 SCR 162 : (1996) 1 SCC 35 31 [2007] 12 SCR 375 : (2008) 1 SCC 465 32 [2022] 3 SCR 876 : (2022) 17 SCC 434 33 2024 INSC 883; in addition to Tulasamma this case also relied on Raghubar Singh v. Gulab Singh (1998) 6 SCC 314, Mangat Mal v. Punni Devi (1995) 6 SCC 88 and Jaswant Kaur v. Harpal Singh (1989) 3 SCC 572.
