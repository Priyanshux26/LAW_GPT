(5) Notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship, with the parties or counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator: 2306 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Provided that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub- section by an express agreement in writing.” 22. Two categories of challenge under Section 12. The effect of the 2015 Amendment is that there are now two separate categories for the parties to challenge the appointment of an arbitrator. First, a challenge under Section 12(3) to an appointed arbitrator based on justifiable doubts regarding his independence and impartiality, by using the procedure under Section 13. While Section 12(3) itself remains unamended, the insertion of Explanation 1 in Section 12(1), read with the Fifth Schedule, now enlists the circumstances that give rise to justifiable doubts as to an arbitrator’s independence and impartiality. The Fifth Schedule contains 34 entries that have been adopted from the Red and Orange Lists of the IBA Guidelines. A written disclosure on these grounds must be made in the form provided in the Sixth Schedule.51 22.1 The second category is under Section 12(5) which declares certain persons to be ‘ineligible’ to be appointed as arbitrators. These ineligibilities are enlisted in the Seventh Schedule. The provision itself stipulates that such ineligibility is notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary. In these situations, the ineligibility of the person to act as an arbitrator is a matter of law and goes to the root of their appointment.52 As they are de jure unable to perform their function, their mandate automatically terminates under Section 14(1)(a), and the appointment need not be challenged before the arbitral tribunal under Section 13. The parties can apply to the court under Section 14(2) for a decision on the termination of the arbitrator’s mandate and appointment of a substituted arbitrator.53 The only way for parties to by-pass such ineligibility, as provided in the proviso, is to enter into an express agreement in writing, subsequent to the disputes having arisen, to waive the applicability of Section 12(5).54 51 HRD Corporation (Marcus Oil and Chemical Division) v. GAIL (India) Ltd. (2018) 12 SCC 471, paras 11- 12; Chennai Metro Rail Ltd v. Transtonnelstroy Afcons (JV) (2024) 6 SCC 211, para 25. 52 Bharat Broadband Network Limited v. United Telecoms Limited (2019) 5 SCC 755. 53 ibid, paras 15-17; HRD Corporation (supra), paras 11-12; Chennai Metro Rail (supra), para 26. 54 ibid. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2307 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company 23. The difference between these categories is important to bear in mind. In the former situation, there is no bar to the appointment itself, but the appointment may later be challenged before the arbitral tribunal. On the other hand, in the latter situation, the Act places an express bar on the appointment of certain ‘ineligible’ persons as arbitrators, notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary.
