We take notice of the fact that “taxable goods” has been separately defi ned under Section 2(ai) of the UP VAT Act. The defi nition reads thus: “(ai) “taxable goods” means any goods except goods mentioned or described in column (2) of Schedule I;” GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR INTERPRETATION OF TAXING STATUTES 36. It is well accepted that a statute must be construed in accordance with the intention of the Legislature and the courts should act upon the true intention of the Legislation while applying law and while interpreting law. In the litigation on hand, we have been asked to interpret the provisions of a taxing statute. 37. Justice G.P. Singh, in his treatise Principles of Statutory Interpretation (14th Edn. 2016 p. 879) after referring to Micklethwait, In re;1 Partington v. Attorney General2, Rajasthan Rajya Sahakari Spg. & Ginning Mills Federation Ltd. v. CIT3, State Bank of Travancore v. CIT4 1 (1855) LR 11 Ex 452 : 156 ER 908 2 (1869) LR 4 HL 100 3 (2014) 11 SCC 672 4 (1986) 2 SCC 11 : 1986 SCC (Tax) 289 762 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. and Cape Brandy Syndicate v. IRC5, summed up the law in the following manner: “A taxing statute is to be strictly construed. The well-established rule in the familiar words of Lord Wensleydale, reaffi rmed by Lord Halsbury6 and Lord Simonds7, means: “The subject is not to be taxed without clear words for that purpose; and also that every Act of Parliament must be read according to the natural construction of its words.”” 38. In a classic passage Lord Cairns stated the principle thus: “If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed, however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the Crown seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of law the case might otherwise appear to be. In other words, if there be admissible in any statute, what is called an equitable construction, certainly, such a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute where you can simply adhere to the words of the statute.” 39. Viscount Simon quoted8 with approval a passage9 from Rowlatt, J. expressing the principle in the following words: (Cape Brandy case10, KB p. 71) ‘… in a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is no presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used.’” 40. It was further observed: “In all tax matters one has to interpret the taxation statute strictly. 5 (1921) 1 KB 64 6 Ed: Tennant v.
