(D.R.) Notification No. 161-Cus dated 22.06.1963 and M.F.(D.R.&I.) Notification No. 33-Cus., dated 27.04.1974 which entrusted functions of customs officer to police officers in a particular jurisdiction and officers of the B Security Force respectively. However, in the case of DRI officers, they would clearly fall under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Act, 1962 and the notifications conferring powers and duties are already on record. 33. Our attention was also drawn to Notification 161-Cus dated 22.06.1963 issued under Section 6 entrusting powers of search to DRI officers. As per Notifications GSR 214 and GSR 215 issued in the same year under Section 4 of the Act, 1962, all officers of DRI were appointed as officers of customs. Therefore, an inadvertent reference to Section 6 under Notification No. 161 dated 22.06.1963 should not lead to the drawing of any adverse inferences as at the highest, it may only be a case of misquoting of a Section. Secondly, till 11.05.2002, it was the Central Government which was the appointing authority under Section 4 for officers of customs as well as for entrustment under Section 6. It is only from 11.05.2002 that the powers under Section 4 were delegated to the Board since Notification No. 161 dated 22.06.1963 was issued prior to 11.05.2002 and the authority being the Central Government under both Sections, any incorrect reference to a provision would be totally inconsequential. 34. He submitted that by virtue of the aforesaid and also without reference to the Notification No. 44/2011 – Cus (N.T.) dated 06.07.2011, erroneous conclusions came to be rendered in paragraphs 17 to 23 230 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the decision under review. The findings in Canon India (supra) in paragraphs 13 and 14 respectively that DRI officers belong to a different department and therefore cannot become proper officers under Section 28, and if done so, would result in anarchical and unruly operation of the statute, too, is erroneous in light of the aforesaid submissions. 35. He further submitted that despite being a conceded position that issuance of a show cause notice under Section 28 is a quasi-judicial exercise of power, this Court fell in error in holding the same to be an administrative review in paragraph 15. The Court also erred in concluding that the expression “the proper officer” can only signify an officer empowered to undertake assessment and re-assessment under Section 17, by placing unfounded reliance on the decision in Consolidated Coffee Ltd. and Anr. v. Coffee Board, Bangalore reported in 1980 AIR 1468 as it relates to a totally different scenario envisaged under Article 286 read with Section 5 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. 36. After pointing out the aforesaid aspects as errors apparent on the face of the record, he prayed that the present review petition be allowed. ii. Why the decision in Sayed Ali (supra) requires reconsideration 37. He submitted that there are two fundamental errors in the dictum laid in Sayed Ali (supra) – (i) Firstly, it casts an obligation that an officer of customs who is empowered to undertake assessment or reassessment under Section 17 alone is qualified to become a proper officer under Section 28 for the purpose of raising demand of short levy, non-levy or erroneous refund.
