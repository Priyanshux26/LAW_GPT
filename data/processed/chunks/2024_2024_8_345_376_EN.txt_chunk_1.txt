[Paras 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 28, 31, 36-38, 46, 48] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.161, 162 – Police Constable-PW-12 claiming to be an eyewitness to the incident reported at the police station with the crime weapons however, he did not submit any report/complaint of the incident – Complaint lodged by PW-11-first informant who was deceased’s cousin brother came to be registered as FIR – Impermissibility: Held: First version of the incident as narrated by the PW-12 would be required to be treated as the FIR and the complaint lodged by PW-11 would be relegated to the category of a statement u/s.161, CrPC and nothing beyond that – The same could not have been treated to be the FIR as it would be hit by s.162 CrPC – Prosecution is thus, guilty of concealing the initial version from the Court and hence, an adverse inference is drawn against the prosecution on this count. [Para 21] Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.26, 21 – Confessions of the accused- appellants recorded by PW-2-Medical Officer while preparing their injury reports of the accused – Admissibility: [2024] 8 S.C.R. 347 Allarakha Habib Memon Etc. v. State of Gujarat Held: The so-called confessions are ex-facie inadmissible in evidence as the accused persons were presented at the hospital by the police officers after having been arrested in the present case – As such, the notings made by PW-2 in the injury reports of the accused would be clearly hit by s.26 – Therefore, the said admissions of the accused not accepted as incriminating pieces of evidence relevant u/s.21. [Para 41] Evidence – Seizure panchnama, FSL Reports – Reliance upon – When not proper – Seizure panchnama recorded that the accused threw away their weapons and fled away from the crime scene and that all the weapons were brought to the police station by police personnel – Reliance placed by Courts below on FSL reports to hold that blood group found on the crime weapons incriminated the accused for the crime as the same matched with the blood group of the deceased – Correctness: Held: Various infirmities create a doubt on the very process of seizure of the weapons – Seizure panchnama (Exhibit -38) does not bear the signatures of PW-12-police constable who admittedly collected the weapons from the crime scene and presented them to the police station – Thus, no credence can be given to seizure panchnama because it was not attested by the witness who had actually presented the weapons at the police station – Trial Court as well as the High Court heavily relied upon the FSL reports (Exhibits 111-115) for finding corroboration to the evidence of the eyewitnesses and in drawing a conclusion regarding culpability of the appellants for the crime however, the testimony of the so-called eyewitnesses is discarded being doubtful – Thus, even presuming that the FSL reports conclude that the blood group found on the weapons recovered at the instance of the accused matched with the blood group of the deceased, this circumstance in isolation, cannot be considered sufficient so as to link the accused with the crime – Further, the IO-PW18’s evidence on the aspect of disclosure statements made by the accused-appellant leading to the recoveries is perfunctory and unacceptable – The witness did not elaborate upon the words spoken by the accused-appellant at the time of making the disclosure statements.
