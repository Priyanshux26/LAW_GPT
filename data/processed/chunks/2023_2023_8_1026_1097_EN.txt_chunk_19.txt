Part-I (Challenge to the for de novo investigation) F 8. As we have pointed out earlier, de novo investigation has been ed by the High Court by its decision dated 31.10.2022 at the instance of one Devasagayam, who was the first person to lodge a complaint way back on 29.10.2015 alleging that one C. Palani working in the Transport Corporation received a sum of Rs.2,60,000/- for securing the job of a Conductor for his son and that he and his accomplices committed G offences punishable under Sections 406 and 420 read with Section 34 IPC. This complaint was registered as FIR No.441 of 2015. Despite the fact that the allegations of Devasagayam related to payment of money to an employee of the Transport Corporation for procuring a job for his son, the offences under the PC Act were not included in the FIR. H Interestingly, Devasagayam is a retired employee of the Railways. While Y. BALAJI v. KARTHIK DESARI & ANR. ETC. 1051 [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] he was happy about paying illegal gratification for procuring A employment for his son, he was not unhappy about the Police not including the offences under the PC Act in FIR No.441 of 2015. 9. This attitude of Devasagayam was responsible for an allegation being made against Devasagayam in a petition filed by another victim by name Gopi, in Criminal O.P. No.7503 of 2016, that Devasagayam had B been won over by the accused. 10. On Devasagayam’s complaint, the Investigating Officer filed a Final Report on 13.06.2017, which led to the registration of a Calendar Case in CC No.3627 of 2017. Even in this Final Report, the offences under the PC Act were not included. Devasagayam did not bother to C question the Police or move the Court as to why the offences under the PC Act were not included. 11. But fortunately, pursuant to the passed by the High Court in the petition filed by Gopi, another Calendar Case came to be registered in CC No.24 of 2021, on a further Report submitted by the Police under D Section 173(8) of the Code. In this CC No.24 of 2021, the Minister and his accomplices were included as accused and the offences under the PC Act were included. 12. This further Report under Section 173(8) of the Code which culminated in the registration of CC No.24 of 2021 was filed on E 08.03.2021. 13. The inclusion of the name of the Minister and his accomplices in the Final Report submitted under Section 173(8) and the inclusion of the offences under the PC Act seems to have bothered Devasagayam more than the Minister himself. Therefore, Devasagayam filed a petition F in Criminal O.P. No.15122 of 2021 in CC No.24 of 2021 seeking a direction to the Investigating Officer to conduct a de novo investigation. 14. The grounds on which Devasagayam sought de novo investigation were quite strange. In his petition seeking de novo investigation, Devasagayam stated that though his specific complaint G was against one Baskar and nine others, the Final Report filed under Section 173(8) included other persons, who, according to Devasagayam, had no connection with the case.
