By dated 09.12.2020, this Court transferred the writ petitions pending before various High Courts to this Court. That is how, these cases have been clubbed and were heard together and are being disposed of by this common . [2024] 6 S.C.R. 787 Shaji Poulose v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India & Others 1.2 The petitioners are, specifically, aggrieved by the mandatory ceiling limit imposed by Clause 6.0, Chapter VI of said Guidelines on the number of tax audits that a Chartered Accountant can accept in a financial year under Section 44AB of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as, “IT Act, 1961”). Additionally, and importantly, the petitioners seek a direction for quashing and/or setting aside of the disciplinary proceedings initiated by the respondent-Institute in pursuance of the Impugned Guideline. Clause 6.0, Chapter VI of Guidelines dated 08.08.2008 provides that a member of the Institute in practice shall not accept, in a financial year, more than the “specified number of tax audit assignments” under Section 44AB of the IT Act, 1961.
