What are those disturbing interrogatories?” 49 The Three Judges have given a very wide meaning to the term material resources, stating: “81……….. material resources of the community in the context of re-ing the national economy embraces all the national wealth, not merely natural resources, all the private and public sources of meeting material needs, not merely public possessions. Every thing of value or use in the material world is material resource and the individual being a member of the community his resources are part of those of the community. To exclude ownership of private resources from the coils of Article 39(b) is to cipherise its very purpose of redistribution the socialist way. A directive to the State with a deliberate design to dismantle feudal and capitalist citadels of property must be interpreted in that spirit and hostility to such a purpose alone can be hospitable to the meaning which excludes private means of production or goods produced from the instruments of production”.50 (Emphasis supplied) After Ranganatha Reddy, comes the unanimous decision of the Five Judge Bench of this Court in Sanjeev Coke where ‘material resources’ were held to be as follows:- 49 (1977) 4 SCC 471, para 40. 50 (1977) 4 SCC 471, para 81. 292 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “And material resources of the community in the context of reing the national economy embraces all the national wealth, not merely natural resources, all the private and public sources of meeting material needs, not merely public possessions. Every thing of value or use in the material world is material resource and the individual being a member of the community his resources are part of those of the community. To exclude ownership of private resources from the coils of Article 39(b) is to cipherise its very purpose of redistribution the socialist way.” It then goes on to say this: “We hold that the expression “material resources of the community” is not confined to natural resources; it is not confined to resources owned by the public; it means and includes all resources, natural and man-made, public and private-owned”.51 26.
