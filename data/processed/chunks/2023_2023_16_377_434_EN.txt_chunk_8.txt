He has indeed been an asset to Kannur University, an institution still in its infancy. The remarkable achievements of the university in academic rating is the result of the hard work put in by the faculty and staff of the University under the able leadership of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran. The NAAC has upgraded the status of the University from B to B. He was instrumental in digitizing the University by introducing Digital Document Filling System (DDFS) and enthusiastically directed the University to amend its status in tune with UGC Regulations, 2018. He also initiated steps for starting a separate Research Directorate with the aim of improving research standards in the University. During his tenure, the University signed several MOUs with reputed national and international organization. Under his stewardship, the University also started a Business incubation Centre and established an Institution’s Innovation Council to encourage the innovative potential of researchers and students. Kannur University under his able leadership, rose to eminence as one of the premier university in the country. It is therefore my considered opinion that Dr. Gopinath Raveendran may be allowed to continue for another term as Vice Chancellor. Its continuation will immensely benefi t Kannur University Section 10 (10) of Kannur University Act provides for the reappointment of incumbent Vice Chancellor for a second term and· does not stipulate any restriction on age. I request your Excellency to be pleased to cancel the notifi cation dated 27.10.20 appointing a Search-cum-Selection committee for identifying the person to be appointed as Vice Chancellor.
