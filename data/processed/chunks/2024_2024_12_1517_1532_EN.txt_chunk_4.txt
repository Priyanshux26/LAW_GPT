At the time of induction, his pay scale was ₹425-800, which was revised over time to ₹5500-9000. o In 1999, he was granted the first financial upgradation under the ACPS and he was given the promotional post scale of ₹6500-10500 with Grade Pay of ₹4200. o Pursuant to the Ministry’s letter dated 21.04.2004, he was then moved to the higher Grade Pay of ₹₹4800. Subsequently, on 18.07.2000, he was promoted to Superintendent, but his pay was not changed as he was already given the promotional scale of pay due to the upgradation under the ACPS, a year earlier. o Upon implementation of the CCS RP Rules, the post of Superintendent carried two pay scales. The first pay scale was in PB-2 with Grade Pay of ₹4800 and the second was PB-2 with Grade Pay of ₹5400. The Grade Pay of ₹5400 was applicable after four years of service in that post. As Devendra Saxena had already completed four years of service in the post of Superintendent, he was given PB-2 with Grade Pay of ₹5400 w.e.f. 01.01.2006. o Thereafter, on 16.09.2006, as he completed 24 years of service, he was granted his second financial upgradation under the ACPS by giving him the promotional post scale of ₹8000-13500 in PB-3 with Grade Pay of ₹5400. o In effect, he was given three financial upgradations in terms of Grade Pay in less than 30 years of service but was again granted a further upgradation on 16.09.2012, upon completing 30 years in service, by giving him the Grade Pay of ₹6600. This was clearly erroneous. 12. It would be relevant to reproduce the relevant clauses of the MACPS, which read as under: 1524 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports “1. There shall be three financial upgradations under the MACPS, counted from the direct entry grade on completion of 10, 20 and 30 years service respectively. Financial upgradation under the Scheme will be admissible whenever a person has spent 10 years continuously in the same grade-pay. 2. The MACPS envisages merely placement in the immediate next higher grade pay in the hierarchy of the recommended revised pay bands and grade pay as given in Section 1, Part-A of the first schedule of the CCS (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008. Thus, the grade pay at the time of financial upgradation under the MACPS can, in certain cases where regular promotion is not between two successive grades, be different than what is available at the time of regular promotion. ln such cases, the higher grade pay attached to the next promotion post in the hierarchy of the concerned cadre/organisation will be given only at the time of regular promotion. xxx xxx xxx 5. Promotions earned/upgradation granted under the ACP Scheme in the past to those grades which now carry the same grade pay due to merger of pay scales/upgradations of posts recommended by the Sixth Pay Commission shall be ignored for the purpose of granting upgradations under Modified ACPS. Illustration-1 The pre-revised hierarchy (in ascending ) in a particular organization was as under:- ₹5000-8000, ₹5500-9000 & ₹6500-10500.
