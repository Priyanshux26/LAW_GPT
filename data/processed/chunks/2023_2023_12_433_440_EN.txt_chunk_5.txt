Both the courts have appreciated the evidence on record threadbare in the right perspective and have found the appellant guilty for the off ence under Section 7 and Section 13(1)(d) r/w 13(2) of the PC Act. We do not see any valid ground to interfere with the well considered fi ndings recorded by both the courts below. 14. In that view of the matter, the criminal appeal being devoid of merits is dismissed. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal dismissed. Ankit Gyan
