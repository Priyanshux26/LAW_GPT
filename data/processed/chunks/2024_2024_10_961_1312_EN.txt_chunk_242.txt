In AK Gopalan (supra), the majority of this Court observed that the fundamental rights operate in mutually exclusive silos. In 1970, the decision in Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India,166 rejected this interpretation of Part III holding that fundamental rights are not water-tight compartments. Once this Court has held that fundamental rights are not water- tight compartments, rights which are not expressly subject to reasonable restrictions can be restricted to give effect to other fundamental rights.167 For example, Article 30 which guarantees the right to establish and administer educational institutions, similar to Article 29, is not subject to an express restrictions clause. This Court in numerous decisions has held that the absence of a subjection clause does not mean that a minority educational institution cannot be regulated.168 Thus, the observation in Jagdev Singh Sidhanti (supra) that the right guaranteed by Article 29 is absolute is no more good law is view of the subsequent developments on the interpretation of Part III of the Constitution. 99. It is in this backdrop that the issue of whether Section 6A is violative of Article 29(1) of the Constitution must be decided. The petitioners’ contention that Section 6A is violative of Article 29 is based on 163 For a detailed exposition on the positive and negative facets of a fundamental right, see Supriyo @ Supriyo Chakraborty v. Union of India, 2023 INSC 920 [Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, 156-158] 164 “25 […] Unlike Article 19(1), Article 29(1) is not subject to any reasonable restrictions. The right conferred upon the Section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any thereof to conserve their language, script or culture is made by the Constitution absolute” 165 AIR 1950 SC 27 166 [1970] 3 SCR 530 : (1970) 1 SCC 248; Also see Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) 1 SCC 248 167 See Indian Young Lawyers Association v. State of Kerala (2019) 11 SCC 1 [217] 168 See State of Kerala v. Very Rev. Mother Provincial (1970) 2 SCC 417; Ahmedabad St. Xavier’s College Society v. State of Gujarat (1974) 1 SCC 717; TMA Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka (2002) 8 SCC 481 1296 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the following premises: (a) conferring citizenship to migrants from Bangladesh to Assam will increase Bengali population in Assam; and (b) the increase in Bengali population affects the culture of the Assamese population. The premise of the petitioners argument is not that the effect of the provision is that the people of Assam are prevented from taking steps to conserve their culture neither is it that the State is not taking effective steps to create conditions to enable groups to take steps to conserve culture. The argument of the petitioners is that the culture of Assam is infringed by the large influx of Bangladeshi immigrants who are conferred citizenship and Section 6A to the extent that it allows the influx is unconstitutional. 100. I am unable to accept this argument. First, as a matter of constitutional principle, the mere presence of different ethnic groups in a State is not sufficient to infringe the right guaranteed by Article 29(1).
