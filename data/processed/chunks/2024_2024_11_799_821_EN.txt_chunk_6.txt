The factum of the respondent participating in the departmental proceeding or stating that he was due to superannuate on 30.10.2012 would be of no consequence. Further, payment of subsistence allowance by the appellant bank and acceptance of the same by the respondent would also not lead to extension of service of the respondent post 01.10.2010. 13.4. Learned senior counsel for the respondent therefore submits that the of penalty imposed by the appellant bank on the respondent is clearly void ab initio and the High Court had rightly interfered with the same. In support of his submissions, he has placed reliance on the following decisions: (i) UCO Bank Vs. Rajinder Lal Capoor;2 and (ii) UCO Bank Vs. M.B. Motwani,3 14. Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties have received the due consideration of the Court. 15. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and upon perusal of the materials on record, we may briefly refer to the relevant 2 [2007] 7 SCR 543: (2007) 6 SCC 694 3 [2023] 16 SCR 525 : (2023) SCC Online SC 1327 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 809 State Bank of India & Ors. v. Navin Kumar Sinha provisions of the statutes governing the service condition of the respondent. 15.1. In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-Section(1) of Section 43 of the State Bank of India Act, 1955, the Central Board of the State Bank of India has made the State Bank of India Officers (Determination of Terms and Conditions of Service) , 1979 (briefly ‘the Service ’ hereinafter) to determine certain terms and conditions of appointment and service of officers in the State Bank of India (SBI). 19 thereof deals with the age of retirement. Clause (1) of 19 says that an officer shall retire from the service of SBI on attaining the age of 58 years or upon the completion of 30 years’ service or 30 years’ pensionable service if he is a member of the Pension Fund, whichever occurs first. Thus, as per clause (1) of 19 of the Service , an officer of SBI shall retire from the service of the bank on the happening of three contingencies whichever occurs first. The three contingencies are: (i) on attaining the age of 58 years; or (ii) upon completion of 30 years of service; or (iii) completed 30 years of pensionable service, if he is a member of the Pension Fund. 15.2. Therefore, what this provision contemplates is that an officer of SBI shall retire from service on completion of any one of the three contingencies whichever happens first. The first proviso confers a discretion upon the competent authority to extend the period of service of an officer who has either attained the age of 58 years or has completed 30 years of service or has completed 30 years of pensionable service, if it is deemed that such extension is desirable in the interest of SBI. However, the extended period of service shall not be counted for the purpose of pension. 15.3. As per clause (2) of 19, no officer of SBI who has ceased to be in the service of SBI by virtue of any of the contingencies provided for in clause (1), shall be deemed to have retired from the service of the said bank for the purpose of the Pension and Guarantee Fund Rules or the Pension Fund Rules unless such cessation of service has been sanctioned on retirement for the purpose of either of the aforesaid two rules.
