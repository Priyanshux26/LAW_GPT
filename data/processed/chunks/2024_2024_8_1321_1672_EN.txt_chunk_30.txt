Seats were apportioned in specific proportions for Non-Brahmins (Hindus), Backward Hindus, Brahmins, Harijans, Anglo-Indians, Christians and Muslims.56 In State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan,57 a Constitution Bench of this Court held the reservation of seats in educational institutions on that basis to be unconstitutional and violative Article 29(2) which stipulates that no citizen shall be denied admission in any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language, or any of them. The Court observed that Article 29 does not contain an exception clause such as Article 16(4) which would permit reservation of seats in educational institutions. 52 See State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar, 1952 AIR 75 53 Chiranjit Lal Chowdhury v. Union of India (1950) SCC 833 [38,39] 54 Chiranjit Lal Chowdhury v. Union of India (1950) SCC 833 [38,39] 55 General Manager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari, AIR 1962 SC 36; CA Rajendra v. Union of India, AIR 1968 SC 507 56 Non-Brahmin (Hindus): 6; Backward Hindus: 2; Brahmins: 2; Harijan: 2, Anglo-Indians and Indian Christians (1); Muslims: 1. 57 [1951] SCR 525 1364 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 48. The State of Madras also notified that vacancies to the post of District Munsif would be filed on the basis of the Communal GO. In B Venkataramana v. The State of Madras,58 reservation of seats in services based on the Communal GO was challenged. The Constitution Bench observed that Article 16(4) permits the State to make provisions for ‘backward classes’ in the services if they are not adequately represented in the opinion of the State and that only Harijans and the backward Hindus can be considered as ‘backward classes’. The denial of admission to seats other than those reserved for Harijans and Backward Hindus, it was observed, would be a discrimination based on “caste,” violating Articles 16(1) and 16(2). 49. The above s adopted a formalistic and reservation-limiting approach in the reading of the constitutional provisions. In this approach, reservation was viewed as an exception to the principle of equal opportunity in Articles 15(1) and 16(1). This Court had recognized the principle of reasonable classification in Article 14 before the decision in Champakam Dorairajan (supra). However, it did not transpose the principle to the realm of reservation.59 Even in Venkataramana (supra), this Court held that reservation in services is permissible only because the Constitution expressly provides for it. Reservation or any other form of affirmative action was regarded as antithetical to the equality principle and not a re-statement of it. 50. The Constitution was amended by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act 1951 to include Clause (4) in Article 15 to overcome the in Champakam Dorairajan (supra). Despite the inclusion of Article 15(4), a formalistic reading of the equality code continued. In Balaji v. State of Mysore,60 this Court observed that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are special provisions (or in other words, an exception to the principle of equality) while prescribing a cap of fifty per cent on the total seats to be reserved.
