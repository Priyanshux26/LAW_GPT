F Disposing of the appeals, the Court HELD: 1. A bare reading of the of the Single Judge and the Division Bench would show that the most vital aspect has been lost sight of. Admittedly, the writ petitioners have G obtained consent to establish, from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. It is also admitted that the writ petitioners have obtained an Acknowledgment Certificate under Section 5(3) of the Kerala MSME Act. It is seen from Section 6(1) extracted above that an Acknowledgement Certificate shall have effect as if it is an approval as defined in Section 2(c). What is held against H 413 414 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A the writ petitioners today is the requirement of a permission under the Act of 1994. But Section 10 of the Kerala MSME Act not only confers overriding effect to the Act on other laws, but also makes a specific reference to the Act of 1994. The prayer made by the writ petitioners in their second writ petition, deserved to be granted, clearly in the light of the statutory prescription. [Paras B 8, 9, 10 and 11][417-G-H; 418-A, E, G; 419-E] 2. The Kerala MSME Act overrides the 1994 Act and a few other local enactments. This is why the writ petitioners have taken “consent” from the Pollution Control Board. Once consent is taken from the Pollution Control Board, the necessity for reading C down Section 10 of the Kerala MSME Act, for the purpose of protecting the environment, does not arise.
