162 – When an omission becomes a contradiction, the procedure provided in the proviso to sub-Section (1) of s.162 must be followed for contradicting witnesses in the cross examination – As per proviso to sub-Section (1) of s.162, the witness has to be contradicted in the manner provided u/s. 145 of the Evidence Act – Object of this requirement of confronting the witness by showing him the relevant part of his prior statement is to give the witness a chance to explain the contradiction – This is a rule of fairness – Furthermore, every contradiction or omission is not a ground to discredit the witness or to disbelieve his/her testimony – Minor or trifle omission or contradiction not sufficient to disbelieve the witness’s version – Only when there is a material contradiction or omission can the Court disbelieve the witness’s version either fully or partially – Material contradiction or omission depends upon the facts of each case – Whether an omission is a contradiction also depends on the facts of each individual case. [Paras 7-9] Penal Code, 1860 – ss. 141, 149 – Unlawful assembly – When: Held: s. 141 defines unlawful assembly as an assembly of five or more persons – U/s. 149, every member of an unlawful assembly is guilty of the offences committed in the prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly – Thus, to apply s. 149, there has to be an unlawful assembly – On facts, five appellants 22 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports were convicted for the offence punishable u/s. 302 with the aid of s. 149 and ultimately, the High Court held that only four accused were guilty – High Court did not hold that apart from the present appellants whose conviction was confirmed, others formed part of the unlawful assembly – Hence, there was no unlawful assembly within the meaning of s.141 – Appellants could not have been convicted for the offence punishable u/s. 302 with the aid of s. 149.
