Such observations do not lend support to the case of the appellant so as to shift the entire burden on the auction purchaser despite significant omission in the terms and conditions of sale. 22. In AI Champdany Ltd. (supra), the appellant had purchased G the assets of the company under liquidation and was subsequently served with notice by municipality for payment of arrears of property tax. Upon taking out a chamber summons with the prayer that appellant would only be liable for property tax after date of confirmation of sale, the application was dismissed on the ground that it was incumbent on the H 1114 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A purchaser to make enquiries regarding the liabilities attached to the assets before making an offer. The intra-court appeal was dismissed by the Division Bench. In the appeal before this Court, it was held that dues in relation to municipal tax in terms of the relevant provisions of the Companies Act did not create an encumbrance or charge on the property and was considered to be a personal liability. This Court, inter alia, B observed and held as under: - “10. Dues in relation to the municipal tax in terms of the provisions of the said Act do not create any encumbrance on the property. It does not create any charge. It is considered to be a personal liability. On the aforementioned premise, we have to construe the C terms and conditions of the sale… *** *** *** 12. The terms and conditions of the sale must be read as a whole. It must be given a purposive meaning. The word “encumbrance” in relation to the word “immovable property” carries a distinct D meaning. It ordinarily cannot be assigned a general and/or dictionary meaning. *** *** *** 15. The respondent municipality was an unsecured creditor. In E that capacity it cannot stand on a higher footing than an ordinary unsecured creditor who is required to stand in queue with all others similarly situated for the purpose of realisation of their dues from the sale proceeds. 16. The Companies Act or any other law does not impose any F additional obligation upon the purchaser to make an enquiry with regard to the liabilities of the companies other than those which would impede their value. *** *** *** 18. We may notice that Section 141 of the Bombay Provincial G Municipal Corporations Act provides the property taxes to be a first charge on the premise for which they are assessed. It is in that view of the matter, Section 100 of the Transfer of Property Act was found to be capable of being invoked therein, which reads as under: H OFFICIAL LIQUIDATOR v. UJJAIN NAGAR PALIKA NIGAM 1115 & ORS. [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] “100. Charges.—Where immovable property of one person A is by act of parties or operation of law made security for the payment of money to another, and the transaction does not amount to a mortgage, the latter person is said to have a charge on the property, and all the provisions hereinbefore contained which apply to a simple mortgage shall, so far as may be, apply to such charge.
