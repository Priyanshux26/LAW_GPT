2. Do the defendants prove that the transaction between late Gangaramiah and late Smt.

In the appeal fi led by the appellant against the and decree of the trial Court, following two questions were framed by the High Court: “1. Whether the trial Court was justifi ed in holding the document dated 20.12.1973 [registered on 24.12.1973] as sale deed and consequently rejecting the claim of the plaintiff that the said sale deed if read along with the agreement of buy back dated 24.12.1973 would not constitute mortgage of suit schedule property in favour of Smt. Rudramma?. 2. Whether the trial Court was justifi ed in dismissing the suit holding that the documents dated 20.12.1973 [registered on 24.12.1973] as absolute sale deed and consequently rejecting the prayer of the plaintiff for redemption of mortgage?” 20. Both the aforesaid questions were decided against the appellant by the High Court. 21. A perusal of the aforesaid questions framed by the High Court shows that, these are co-related. The core issue was as to whether the transaction between the parties was an absolute sale of the property or it was a mortgage. The issue of limitation, with reference to the challenge to the Sale Deed having been decided against the appellant by the trial Court, was not raised before the High Court, as is evident from the questions framed. Hence, this aspect could not be addressed before this Court. 22. The argument raised by Mrs. Kiran Suri, learned Senior counsel for the appellants, on the aforesaid issue was that on a perusal of the documents the Court can always opine as to whether the intention of the party was to get an absolute Sale Deed registered or it was a mortgage. The submission was that, both the documents were executed on the same day. Reconveyance of the property in favour of the vendor, father of the appellant, on the payment of the same amount of consideration within fi ve years, would clearly lead to an inference that the said transaction was a Mortgage Deed. Coupled with the fact that possession of the property had always remained with the appellant, otherwise the same would have been delivered to the vendee. 23. Before we appreciate the arguments raised at the Bar, we may refer to Section 58 of the 1882 Act4wherein the terms: “mortgage”, “mortgagor” 1044 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R.
