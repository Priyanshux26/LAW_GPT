A Development and Building Rules, 2019. Rule 74(3) of the 2019 Rules, is relied upon to contend that it creates a legal fiction that anything done under the Rules/Regulations, is deemed to have been done under the 2019 Regulations. Reliance is placed on in Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. State of Bihar and others17. The word ‘including’ extends and enlarges the scope of the Clause [See State of Jammu & B Kashmir v. Lakhwinder Kumar and others18]. If challenge to the Rules/ Regulations succeeds, it will also render the sanction of the development plans, illegal, which will necessitate petitioners applying afresh under the 2019 Rules, whereunder also, the prescription of 10 per cent land being gifted, exists. C 22. It is further contended that the Rules/Regulations, being part of the master plan, are statutory and being framed under the Statute, they operate as law under Article 300A. Reliance is placed on Pune Municipal Corporation and another v. Promoters and Builders Association and another19. Reliance placed by appellants on Pt. Chet D Ram Vashist (Dead) by Lrs. v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi20, is alleged to be misplaced. In the said case, there is no provision in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, under which, the Corporation could pass a Resolution to ask the appellant therein to transfer property free of cost. It is further contended that the Court may bear in mind that the Act replaced the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1920, E which was based on the British Town and Country Planning and Housing Act, 1909. From the Statements of Objects and Reasons, it is contended that the Act was based on the Model Town and Country Planning Bill, which was prepared by the Ministry of Health and Housing of the Government of India after a comprehensive study of various Town Planning Enactments in the western countries. The regional concept in F the Maharashtra Town and Country Planning Act, 1966 also made its presence felt. The Act is designed to serve legitimate state interest of planned development down to the regional limit.Crowded urban areas, create adverse living conditions. The reservation of open space for parks and playgrounds is universally recognised. The decision of this Court in G Bangalore Medical Trust v. B.S. Muddappa and others21, is relied 17(1955) 2 SCR 603 18 (2013) 6 SCC 333) 19(2004) 10 SCC 796 20(1995) 1 SCC 47 H 21 (1991) 4 SCC 54 ASSOCIATION OF VASANTH APARTMENTS’ OWNERS v. 1051 V. GOPINATH & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] upon. It is contended that the Act requires only the simple laying of A Rules and Regulations under Section 123 of the Act. The laying of the Rules, which is not mandatory, if not followed, will not affect the validity of the Rules/Regulations. The terms of Section 123(2) are relied upon to contend that the Rules will come into effect even before they are placed before the Legislative Assembly and any modification made by the B Assembly, will apply only from the date it is carried out.
