Therefore, where an is passed for payment of customs duty along with an of imposition of fine in lieu of confiscation of goods, it shall only be referable to sub-section (2) of Section 125 of the Customs Act. It would not attract Section 28(1) of the Customs Act which covers the cases of duty not levied, short- levied or erroneously refunded etc. The for payment of duty under Section 125(2) would be an integral part of proceedings relating to confiscation and consequential s thereon, on the ground as in this case that the importer had violated the conditions of notification subject to which exemption of goods was granted, without attracting the provisions of Section 28(1) of the Customs Act.” 9.6. We conclude by holding that Jagdish Cancer case is not an authority for the proposition that when the liability to pay customs duty has occasioned under Section 125, the calculation, determination or the assessment of such duty cannot be made under Section 28. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1201 M/s Navayuga Engineering Co. Ltd. v. Union of India & Anr. 10. Re: Whether the liability to pay such duty will include the liability to pay interest on delayed payment under section 28AB of the Act? 10.1. The text of Section 125(2) clearly provides that, where any fine in lieu of confiscation of goods is imposed under sub-Section (1), the owner of such goods shall be ‘liable to any duty and charges payable with respect to such goods’. The sub-section provides that the liability to any duty and charges, that are payable, shall be paid in addition to the fine. We have held that Section 28 would come into operation for assessing and determining the duty and other charges payable with respect to goods redeemed under Section 125(2). Once Section 28 applies for determination of duty obligation arising under Section 125(2), the interest on delayed payment of duty arises under Section 28AB. The said provision obligates payment of interest in addition to the duty. We thus answer the last issue by holding that the interest liability under Section 28 AB is also attracted. 11. Conclusion: For the reasons mentioned hereinabove, we uphold the decision of the High Court in Writ Petition Lodging No. 1387 of 2009 dated 29.08.2009 and dispose of the present Civil Appeal No. 1024 of 2014. No as to costs. Result of the case: Appeal disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
