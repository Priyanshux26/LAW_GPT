Only in H 1054 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A case of demand notice for the period prior to inserting Sub-section (6) of Section 1 of the Act, it can be said that the same provision has been applied retrospectively. Therefore, the High Court has committed a very serious error in observing and holding that even for the demand notices for the period subsequent20.10.1989 i.e., subsequent to inserting Sub- section (6) of Section 1 the said provision is applied retrospectively and B the High Court has erred in allowing the appeal and setting aside the demand notices even for the period subsequent to 20.10.1989. Sub-section (6) of Section 1 therefore, shall be applicable even with respect to those establishments, established prior to 31.03.1989/20.10.1989 and the ESI Act shall be applicable irrespective of the number of persons employed C or notwithstanding that the number of persons employed at any time falls below the limit specified by or under the ESI Act. 8. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeal succeeds. The impugned and passed by the High Court is hereby set aside and the demand notices for the period D post 20.10.1989 are hereby restored. Present appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.
