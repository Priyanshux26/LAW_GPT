When there are no recoveries from the sale of the charged properties, the entirety of the amount of default by RCom would be rendered in shortfall or deficiency and form part of the Corporate Debtor’s liability to pay. He pointed out that in the present case, the Corporate Debtor has not merely provided security for RCom’s dues but has also expressly undertaken to pay any shortfall or deficiency that may arise in the recovery of the amounts from RCom following the realisation from the sale of the security. Therefore, clause 5(iii) of the DoH contains the ingredients 6 2023 INSC 500 : (2023) 7 SCC 324 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2053 China Development Bank v. Doha Bank Q.P.S.C. & Ors. of a contract of guarantee under Section 126 of the Contract Act. Relying upon the definition of financial debt under Section 5(8) of the IBC, he submitted that the facility availed by RCom undoubtedly falls within the definition of financial debt and especially, clause (a) of sub-section (8) of Section 5 of the IBC. Therefore, the guarantee provided by RITL-Corporate Debtor for such a financial facility would be a financial debt, which would entitle the appellant to be classified as a Financial Creditor. 20. He submitted that a sentence or term in a document is not determinative of the real nature of the document and obligations thereunder. He relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of B.K. Muniraju v. State of Karnataka & Ors.7, to state that the nature of the document or transaction between the parties to the contract is to be read as a whole and is not to be determined by the nomenclature/title of a contract. He submitted that the rights flow from the contents of the document. He submitted that as held by this Court in the case of Union of India v. D.N. Revri & Co. and Ors.8, a contract must be interpreted in such a manner so as to give efficacy to the contract between the parties rather than to invalidate the same. Moreover, a contract must be read as a whole and attempts should be made to harmonise the terms. He submitted that as held in the case of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited v. Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission & Ors.9, the Court should not rewrite a contract in the guise of interpreting the terms thereof. 21. In reference to the argument regarding the extinguishment of the claim of the appellant due to the moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC, he submitted that Section 14 does not extinguish any right. The learned senior counsel also relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Limited v. Satish Kumar Gupta & Ors.10 He submitted that the provisions of the IBC ensure that successful resolution applicant starts running the business of the Corporate Debtors on a fresh slate. 7 2008 INSC 208 : (2008) 4 SCC 451 8 1976 INSC 208 : (1976) 4 SCC 147 9 2021 INSC 644 : (2022) 4 SCC 657 10 2019 INSC 1256 : (2020) 8 SCC 531 2054 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
