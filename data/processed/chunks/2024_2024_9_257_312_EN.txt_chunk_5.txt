The natural corollary, therefore, is that a person who is already in custody cannot have reasons to believe that he would be arrested as he already stands arrested. The pre-condition to invoke Section 438 CrPC is that the accused should have a reason to believe that he “may be arrested”. If the accused is already in custody, then he can have no reason to believe that he “may be arrested”. iii. The salutary provision of Section 438 of the CrPC was enshrined with a view to see that the liberty of any individual concerned is not put in jeopardy on frivolous grounds at the instance of unscrupulous or irresponsible person or officers who may be in charge of the prosecution. If such is the objective behind the enactment of Section 438 of the CrPC, then for a person who is already arrested there is no question of any humiliation being caused. iv. If an accused while being in custody in connection with one case, is granted anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the CrPC in connection with a different case, then it would not be possible for him to fulfill the requirement of the condition that may be imposed under Section 438(2)(i) of the CrPC i.e. to make himself/herself available for interrogation as and when required. In other words, a person in custody would not be able to meet or comply with the condition that may be imposed under Section 438(2)(i) of the CrPC. This being a material consideration for grant of anticipatory bail, it would be illogical to permit a person to seek anticipatory bail if he is unable to satisfy conditions that may be imposed under Section 438(2) (i) of the CrPC. v. If a person who is already in custody in connection with one case apprehends arrest in connection with a different case, then he is not remediless. In such circumstances, he can seek to [2024] 9 S.C.R. 265 Dhanraj Aswani v. Amar S. Mulchandani & Anr. surrender and pray for regular bail on the principle of “deemed custody” both in Magistrate as well as Sessions triable cases. 5. Mr. Luthra, with a view to fortify his aforesaid submissions, placed strong reliance on the following decisions: i. Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab, [1994] 2 SCR 375, (1994) 3 SCC 569 ii. Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia v. State of Punjab, [1980] 3 SCR 383, (1980) 2 SCC 565 iii. Sushila Aggarwal v. State (NCT of Delhi), [2020] 2 SCR 1, (2020) 5 SCC 1 iv. Sunil Kallani v. State of Rajasthan, 2021 SCC OnLine Raj 1654 v. Rajesh Kumar Sharma v. CBI, 2022 SCC OnLine All 832 vi. Tejesh Suman v. State of Rajasthan, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 76 vii. Bashir Hasan Siddiqui v. State (GNCTD), (2023) SCC OnLine Del 7544 viii. Narinderjit Singh Sahni v. Union of India, [2001] Supp. 4 SCR 114, (2002) 2 SCC 210. 6. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned Senior counsel prayed that there being merit in his appeal, the same may be allowed and the impugned passed by the High Court be set aside.
