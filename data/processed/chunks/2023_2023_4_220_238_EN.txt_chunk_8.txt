So, this disclosure and discovery made thereafter cannot be read against the present appellant. There cannot be a “discovery” of an already discovered fact! What remains is the discovery of currency notes, wrist watch, ‘Parna’ and hair. The forensic report of H 230 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A hair only says that it belongs to ‘human’. The currency notes cannot be really identified with the deceased. What remains is the watch and the ‘Parna’, which has been identified with the deceased. The second is the evidence of “last seen”. This is in the form of PW-10 Kartar Singh who is the neighbour of the complainant and who B had seen the appellant along with co-accused Mange Ram with the deceased on 08.05.2000 at about 7.30 PM in the evening. 9. The admitted position is that the body of deceased was discovered from the canal four days later i.e. on 12.05.2000 in the afternoon and the post-mortem was conducted at about 4.15 PM on the C same day i.e.12.05.2000. According to Post-mortem report the death had taken place more than 48 hours prior to the post-mortem, which would mean that death took place approximately before 4.00 PM on 10.05.2000. Although the autopsy reports normally do not give precise time of death, but only indicate an approximate time or duration, yet under normal circumstances in the present case, death should have been D on May 10, 2000 or May 9, 2000. All the same, the case of the prosecution is that the deceased was killed on May 8, 2000 itself. If this be so then it was the duty of the prosecution to explain as to how rigor mortis remained present in the body, even after four days of the death. The possibility of the rigor mortis remaining in the body for 90 hours cannot E be ruled out completely, but this was never explained by the prosecution. It was the duty of the prosecution to explain the unusual circumstances under which rigor mortis remained present in the body, even for 90 hours, in the month of May. The High Court has only relied upon the evidence of PW-4 Dr. Sumesh Garg who had conducted the post-mortem, who gave his opinion F that the death occurred more than 48 hours before the time of the post- mortem and therefore the deceased was killed by Mange Ram and present appellant on 08.05.2000 this is what has been said by the High Court: - “According to PW-4 Dr. Sumesh Garg, who alongwith Dr. G Ashok Kumar Sharma had conducted post-mortem examination on dead body of Gurmail Singh on 12.05.2000. The probable duration between injuries and death was within minutes and between death and post-mortem more than 48 hours. Thus, it comes out that Gurmail Singh was murdered H by accused-Mange Ram and Dinesh Kumar on 08.05.2000.” DINESH KUMAR v. THE STATE OF HARYANA 231 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] 10. The trial court was conscious of this aspect but then it did not A go into this aspect for the reason that no question was put on this by the defense, this is what was said by the trial court: - “I have gone through the post mortem report.
