Section 11 empowers the Election Commission to maintain delimitation s up-to-date. It provides as follows : “11. Power to maintain delimitation s up-to-date.—(1) The Election Commission may, from time to time, by notifi cation in the Gazette of lndia and in the Offi cial Gazette of the State concerned,— (a) correct any printing mistake in any of the s made by the Commission under Section 9 or any error arising therein from an inadvertent slip or omission; and (b) where the boundaries or name of any district or any territorial division mentioned in any of the said s are or is altered, make such amendments as appear to it to be necessary or expedient for bringing the s up-to-date, so, however, that the boundaries or areas or extent of any constituency shall not be changed by any such notifi cation. (2) Every notifi cation under this section shall be laid, as soon as may be after it is issued, before the House of the People and the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned.” 19. The position of the law relating to delimitation can be summarized as follows: 1. The Delimitation Commission is required to allocate seats to every State in the House of the People and the Legislative Assembly on the basis of the Census of 1971. The Commission has to determine the seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes based on the 2001 census. This exercise is required to be undertaken with due regard to the provisions of Articles 81, 170, 330 and 332 of the Constitution of India;and 108 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 2. This provision is in line with the Explanation to Article 330 of the Constitution. The Explanation stipulates that the reference to ‘population’ in Article 330 and Article 332 is to be construed as the population ascertained at the last preceding census of which the relevant fi gures have been published. However, the proviso states that the reference to the ‘last preceding census’ in the Explanation to Article 330 would be construed as a reference to the 2001 census until relevant fi gures for the fi rst census taken after 2026 have been published. Factual Context 20. The 2001 census figures indicate that the Scheduled Tribes constitute 5.50% and 20.60% of the total population of the States of West Bengal and Sikkim respectively. The fi gures are stated below: States Total Population Population of the Scheduled Tribes as Scheduled Tribes a percentage of the total population West Bengal 8,01,76,197 44,06,794 5.50% Sikkim 5,40,851 1,11,405 20.60% 21. The Union Government constituted the Delimitation Commission under the Delimitation Act 2002.
