In consequence, all the conditions prescribed, as above, have to be satisfied before products suitable for multiple uses can be treated as goods classifiable under Headings 3303 to 3307. 29. The Central Government was also conscious of the effects of the amendments made by the Act of 2005. Circular No. 890/10/2009- CX dated 03.06.2009 was issued by the Central Board of Excise and Customs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, in relation to classification of coconut oil packed in small containers. Thereby, the Board clarified that when ‘hair oil’ is printed on the container/ 914 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports label, there can be no dispute that it is classifiable as hair oil under Chapter 33 and not as edible oil under Chapter 15. The Board noted that Chapter Note 2 in Chapter 33 was modified with effect from 28.02.2005 and the amendment was carried out to align the Central Excise Tariff with the internationally accepted HSN. The Board further noted that in view of the amendment, the clarification issued, vide Circular dated 31.08.1995, required modification. Having said so, the Board strangely concluded that coconut oil packed in containers of up to 200 ml may be considered as generally used as hair oil and that this would bring uniformity in assessment of such oil sold in small containers, irrespective of whether its use as hair oil was indicated on the containers. The Circular dated 31.08.1995 was withdrawn and coconut oil in small quantities, up to 200 ml, was directed to be classified under Heading 3305. 30. However, this understanding of the Board was clearly not in keeping with the General Notes in Chapter 33 of the HSN. Perhaps realizing the same, the Board then issued Circular No. 1007/14/2015-CX dated 12.10.2015. Therein, it was noted that decisions had been rendered on the issue by Tribunals/Courts holding that, just because the retail packs of coconut oil were in sizes of 200 ml or less, the same could not be presumed to be meant for use as hair oil and the same would not be classifiable under Heading 3305. The Board, accordingly, withdrew the Circular dated 03.06.2009 and left the issue of classification of coconut oil packed in small containers of up to 200 ml to be decided in the field, taking into consideration judicial pronouncements and the facts of individual cases. 31. It is also relevant to note that in Heading 1513 in Chapter 15 in Section III of the First Schedule, there is no mention of the size, volume or weight of the packaging and coconut oil, whether or not refined, is classifiable under this heading as long as it is not chemically modified. On the other hand, whenever and wherever it was intended that the weight of the product was a factor to be considered for classification, the headings provided for the same. For instance, Heading 0902 in Chapter IX, titled ‘Coffee, Tea, Mate and Spices’, in Section II of the First Schedule deals with Tea, whether or not flavoured, and the sub- headings thereunder specifically detail the weight of the packaging for the purpose of classification.
