No sooner, the according sanction referred to above came on record, then the Special Court at Hyderabad took cognizance of the off ence enumerated above against the appellant herein and 13 other co-accused. It appears that the appellant herein questioned the legality and validity of the of grant of sanction before the High Court of Telangana by fi ling the Writ Petition No. 33297 of 2016. 10. A learned Single Judge of the High Court allowed the writ petition fi led by the appellant herein holding that the sanctioning authority once having declined to accord sanction could not have taken its earlier in review and granted fresh sanction to prosecute the appellant. The High Court ultimately by dated 30.10.2018 allowed the writ petition and quashed the of grant of sanction. A. SREENIVASA REDDY v. RAKESH SHARMA AND ANR. 937 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] 11. It appears that the CBI being aggrieved with the above referred passed by the learned Single Judge of High Court preferred the Writ Appeal No. 119 of 2019 and questioned the legality and validity of the and passed by the learned Single Judge. 12. The Intra-Court appeal fi led by the CBI failed vide dated 15.07.2019 and thereby the passed by the learned Single Judge came to be affi rmed. 13. The CBI accepted the passed by the High Court and thought fi t not to carry it further. 14. Pursuant to the s dated 30.10.2018 and 15.07.2019 respectively, referred to above, the appellant preferred a discharge application before the Special Court under Section 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short, ‘the CrPC’). 15. The Special Court at Hyderabad by its dated 30.08.2019 discharged the appellant herein from the prosecution under the PC Act, 1988 for want of sanction. The Special Court, however, declined to discharge the appellant for the off ences under the IPC. The Special Court relied on the decision of this Court in the case of Parkash Singh Badal and Another v. State of Punjab and Others reported in (2007) 1 SCC 1. 16. The relevant part of the passed by the Special Judge reads thus: “Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the s of the Hon’ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in W.P. No. 33279/16 dated:30.10.2018, the sanction proceedings issued against A2 for the off ences under Section 13(2) r/w 13(1)(d) of PC Act are set aside and as such A2 is liable to be discharged for the said off ence under 13(2) r/w 13(1)(d) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. As far as the off ences alleged against A2 under the provisions of IPC, the same are to be continued and the accused No. 2 is to be tried for the said off ence along with other accused since the sanction under Section 197 is not required to prosecute the accused No. 2 for the alleged off ences, in view of the above referred of Hon’ble Apex Court in Prakash Singh Badal’s case.
