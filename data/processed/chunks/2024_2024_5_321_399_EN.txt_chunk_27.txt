Section 22 of the Act must be interpreted giving a plain meaning to its contents. An enquiry in terms of Section 16 of the Act by the Board is permissible upon receipt of a reference. Thus, reference having been made on 27- 12-2001 and the suit having been filed on 17-12-2002, the receipt of a reference must be held to be the starting period for proceeding with the enquiry. 11. The effect of the provisions of the Act has been considered by a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Tata Motors Ltd. v. Pharmaceutical Products of India Ltd. [(2008) 7 SCC 619] wherein it, in no uncertain terms, held that SICA is a special statute and, thus, overrides other Acts like the Companies Act, 1956, stating: (SCC p. 635, paras 31-33) “31. SICA furthermore was enacted to secure the principles specified in Article 39 of the Constitution of India. It seeks to give effect to the larger public interest. It should be given primacy because of its higher public purpose. Section 26 of SICA bars the jurisdiction of the civil courts. 32. What scheme should be prepared by the operating agency for revival and rehabilitation of the sick industrial company is within the domain of BIFR. Section 26 not only covers s passed under SICA but also any matter which BIFR is empowered to determine. 33. The jurisdiction of the civil court is, thus, barred in respect of any matter for which the Appellate Authority [2024] 5 S.C.R. 361 Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v. M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited or the Board is empowered. The High Court may not be a civil court but its jurisdiction in a case of this nature is limited.” 12. If the civil court’s jurisdiction was ousted in terms of the provisions of Section 22 of the Act, any rendered by it would be coram non judice. It is a well-settled principle of law that a and decree passed by a court or tribunal lacking inherent jurisdiction would be a nullity. In Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan [AIR 1954 SC 340] this Court held: (AIR p. 342, para 6) “6. … It is a fundamental principle well established that a decree passed by a court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and even in collateral proceedings. A defect of jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it is in respect of the subject-matter of the action, strikes at the very authority of the court to pass any decree, and such a defect cannot be cured even by consent of parties.” (See also Chief Engineer, Hydel Project v. Ravinder Nath [(2008) 2 SCC 350 : (2008) 1 SCC (L&S) 940] , SCC p. 361, para 26. )” (Emphasis supplied) 82. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Raheja Universal Limited v. NRC Limited and Others reported in (2012) 4 SCC 148 undertook a comprehensive study of the various decisions of this Court on the interpretation of Section 22 of the 1985 Act to clarify the divergences and settle the position of law on the said provision.
