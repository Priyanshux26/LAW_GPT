The appellant-plaintiff had purchased the property by paying the full market price. A suit for pre-emption was filed by the appellant-plaintiff which was decreed. The decreetal amount was to be deposited by 10.10.1988. The appellant-plaintiff moved an application before the Trial Court along with pre-filled Treasury Challan seeking permission to deposit ₹ 7,600/-. It was on that application moved by the appellant-plaintiff, the court ed for depositing of ₹ 7,600/-, which was deposited by the appellant-plaintiff. The amount as such was not calculated by the court as it was the duty of the appellant-plaintiff to deposit the correct amount in terms of the decree, which was explicit. 5.1 On an application moved by the respondent-defendant for withdrawal of the amount of ₹ 9,214/- in terms of the decree, the office reported on 06.12.1988 that the amount deposited 6 [1989] Supp. 1 SCR 17 : (1989) 4 SCC 403 : 1989 INSC 265 7 [1964] 2 SCR 145 : AIR 1966 SC 1631: 1963 INSC 42 890 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports was merely ₹ 9,200/-. Immediately, thereafter an application was filed on 23.02.1989 by the respondent-defendant for dismissal of the suit on account of the non-compliance of the terms of the decree by the appellant-plaintiff. More than two years thereafter, the appellant-plaintiff moved an application seeking permission to deposit the balance amount of ₹ 14/- without explaining any reason for moving such an application at a belated stage. More than two months thereafter, an application was filed seeking condonation of delay in deposit of the amount. Even that also did not contain any reason. 5.2 Vide dated 09.01.1992, the Trial Court dismissed the application filed by the appellant-plaintiff seeking leave to deposit ₹ 14/- on account of non-deposit of the whole amount within the time permitted. The passed by the Trial Court was challenged by the appellants before the High Court. Initially, on a wrong premise the High Court allowed the revision petition and set aside the of the Trial Court. However, there being error apparent on the record, the Review Application filed by the respondents was allowed and after recalling the earlier passed in the Revision Petition, the High Court dismissed the same. 5.3 There is no error in the passed by the High Court. Even if the time granted by the court for deposit of the amount can be extended but there has to be sufficient reason for the same. In the case in hand, there is no reason, what to talk about sufficient reason. There was no fault of the Trial Court as the for deposit was passed on the same line as was prayed for by the appellants. 6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the paper book. 7. The respondents purchased the property in dispute from Jai Singh, Jai Kishan, Randhir and Shamsher Singh sons of Balbir Singh son of Dariyav Singh vide registered sale deed dated 06.08.1985. The appellants filed a suit for possession by way of preemption claiming that they being the co-sharers in the Joint Khewat had preferential right to purchase the property.
