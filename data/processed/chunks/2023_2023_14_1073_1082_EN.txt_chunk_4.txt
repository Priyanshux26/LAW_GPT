RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] go to jail; even as per dated 13.12.2018, this Court referred the matter to the Executing Court but nothing material could be done as the Petitioners were not appearing before the Executing Court and again in the regular bail matter15, this court granted them regular bail. Hence, even after so many rounds of litigation, and after 5 years, R2 is still remediless. Submissions on behalf of Petitioner 12. Mr. Hargovind Jha, learned counsel appearing for petitioner submitted that R2 obtained the maintenance only against her husband which can be recovered from the husband or from his assets. The Petitioner is not personally liable to R2 when her husband is alive. There is no law which can directly hold father-in-law to provide maintenance to the wife. 13. The petitioner further contended that the marriage between R2 and his son was dissolved by the divorce decree passed by the court in Australia and therefore, parents-in-law are not liable in this case. In fact, the petition fi led by R2 against petitioner is not maintainable under Section 1916 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereafter HMA) as it is not applicable in the present case. The prayer asked is in violation of Section 2517 of HMA; 15 SLP (Crl.) No. 3876-77 of 2020 16 19. Maintenance of widowed daughter-in-law. — (1)A Hindu wife, whether married before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be entitled to be maintained after the death of her husband by her father-in-law: Provided and to the extent that she is unable to maintain herself out of her own earnings or other property or, where she has no property of her own, is unable to obtain maintenance— (a) from the estate of her husband or her father or mother, or (b)from her son or daughter, if any, or his or her estate. (2) Any obligation under sub-section (1) shall not be enforceable if the father-in-law has not the means to do so from any coparcenary property in his possession out of which the daughter-in-law has not obtained any share, and any such obligation shall cease on the re-marriage of the daughter-in-law. 17 25. Permanent alimony and maintenance- (1)Any court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, that the respondent shall pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent’s own income and other property, if any, the income and other property of the applicant [the conduct of the parties and other circumstances of the case], it may seem to the court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent.
