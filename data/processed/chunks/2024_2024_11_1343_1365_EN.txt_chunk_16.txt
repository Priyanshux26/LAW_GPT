1365 Ramakant Ambalal Choksi v. Harish Ambalal Choksi & Others suit against the vendor. And it has been ruled there on the authority of Turner, LJ in Hadley v. London Bank of Scotland, reported in (1865) 3 De GJ & S 63 at 70 that if there is a clear valid contract for transfer, the Court will not permit the transferor afterwards to transfer the legal estate to third person, although such third person would be affected by lis pendens. Mr. Muhkerjee has drawn our attention to Dr. S. C. Banerji’s Tagore Law Lectures on Specific Relief (2nd Edition, page 592) where the decision in Promotha Nath (supra) has been approvingly referred to and also to Fry’s Treatise on Specific Performance (6th Edition) where the same rule has been enunciated as a general principle on the authority of Turner, L.J., in Hadley (supra). 47. Today, all that we say is that having regard to the nature of dispute between the parties and the materials on record, the property should not change hands any further. 48. In view of the aforesaid, this appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The impugned passed by the High Court is set aside. 49. The respondents herein shall maintain status quo as regards the suit property as on date and shall not create any further encumbrances over the same in any manner. 50. Any further transfer of the suit property pending the final disposal of the suit shall be subject to lis pendens under Section 52 of the T.P. Act irrespective of the fact whether such lis pendens has been duly registered by the plaintiffs with the competent authority or not. 51. Pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
