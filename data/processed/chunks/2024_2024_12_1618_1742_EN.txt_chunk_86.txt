The liability of a surety is coextensive with that of the principal debtor. In case there are more than one surety the liability is to be divided equally among the sureties for unpaid amount of loan. Once the sale has been confirmed it cannot be set aside unless a fundamental procedural error has occurred or sale certificate had been obtained by misrepresentation or fraud.” (Emphasis supplied) 215. In PHR Invent Educational Society v. UCO Bank reported in (2024) 6 SCC 579 it was again reiterated that an auction-sale which stands confirmed can only be interfered with when there was any fraud or collusion, and entertaining of issues regarding the validity of such auction would amount to reopening issues which have achieved finality. The relevant observations read as under: - “34. In our view, the High Court ought to have taken into consideration that the confirmed auction-sale could have been interfered with only when there was a fraud or collusion. The present case was not a case of fraud or collusion. The effect of the of the High Court would be again reopening the issues which have achieved finality.” 216. In V.S. Palanivel v. P. Sriram reported in 2024 INSC 659 this Court again reiterated unless there are some serious flaws in the conduct of the auction as for example perpetration of a fraud/collusion, grave irregularities that go to the root of such an auction, courts must ordinarily refrain from setting them aside keeping in mind the domino effect such an would have. The relevant observations read as under: - “36.14. This Court must underscore the well settled legal position that once an auction is confirmed, it ought to be interfered with on fairly limited grounds. (Refer: Valji Khimji 1738 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports and Co. v. Hindustan Nitro Product (Gujarat) Ltd. (Official Liquidator) MANU/SC/3408/2008 : 2008 : INSC:925 : (2008) 9 SCC 299 and Celir LLP v. Bafna Motors (Mumbai) Private Limited and Ors. MANU/SC/1042/2023 : 2023:INSC:838 : (2024) 2 SCC 1). Repeated interferences in public auction also results in causing uncertainty and frustrates the very purpose of holding auctions. (Refer : K. Kumara Gupta v. Sri Markendaya and Sri Omkareswara Swamy Temple and Ors. MANU/SC/0213/2022 : 2022 : INSC : 207 : (2022) 5 SCC 710). Unless there are some serious flaws in the conduct of the auction as for example perpetration of a fraud/collusion, grave irregularities that go to the root of such an auction, courts must ordinarily refrain from setting them aside keeping in mind the domino effect such an would have. Given the facts noted above, we shall refrain from cancelling the sale or declaring the Sale Deed as void. Instead, it is deemed appropriate to balance the equities by directing the Auction Purchaser to pay an additional amount in respect of the subject property.” (Emphasis supplied) 217. In the present lis, it is not the case of the Borrower herein that the 9th auction conducted by the Bank was a result of any collusion or fraud either at the behest of the Bank or the Successful Auction Purchaser herein.
