While the parties were awaiting for the DRT to pass appropriate an on on the redemption application, the borrowers went to the High Court and fi led the Writ Petition No. 9523 of 2023, seeking directions to the Bank to permit them to redeem the mortgage of the secured asset. 15. The writ petition was fi led on the premise that the borrowers had strong apprehension that the DRT may reject their redemption application and the entire matter would become infructuous more particularly, the Bank having accepted the entire amount from the appellant herein of the total bid. 16. Before the High Court, the borrowers expressed their willingness to pay a total sum of Rs. 129 crore for redeeming the mortgage by 31.08.23. The Bank which had earlier opposed the plea for redemption of mortgage before the DRT for some good reason expressed its willingness before 64 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. the High Court to accept the off er of the borrowers. The Bank perhaps got lured by the fact that the borrowers were paying almost Rs. 23.95 crore more than what was paid by the appellant herein and Rs. 5 crore more than the outstanding amount. 17.
