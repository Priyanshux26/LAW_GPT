JETHWA (SINCE 125 DECEASED THR. LRS.) OTHER CASE DETAILS INCLUDING IMPUGNED AND APPEARANCES CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 6375 of 2023. From the and dated 08.01.2021 of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in WP No.8475 of 2018. Appearances: Sudhir Chandra, Sr. Adv., Bhagabati Prasad Padhy, Achintya Dvivedi, Advs. for the Appellant. Vinay Navare, Sr. Adv., Kailash Pandey, Ranjeet Singh, Krishna Yadav, J. K. Mishra, Gaichangpou Gangmei, Advs. for the respondents. / OF THE SUPREME COURT SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J. 1. This appeal before us shows how the execution proceedings under XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as ‘CPC’), are being delayed, and the process is being abused in the execution proceedings, to the peril of the helpless decree holder. As long back as in 1872 (when the CPC of 1859 was in operation), it was observed by the Privy Council that, “the diffi culties of a litigant in India begin when he has obtained a decree”1. The situation, we are afraid, is no better even today. 2. The appellant is the landlord and the respondents are the tenants in a premises measuring about 3240 sq. ft. bearing C.T.S. No(s). 691/2, 691/3, 691/6, 691/7 and 691/8, situated at Mehra Industrial Compound, Andheri- Kurla Road, Sakinaka, Mumbai (hereinafter referred to as ‘suit property’). We will also be referring to them as the decree holder and the judgement debtors respectively. 1 Raj Durbhunga v. Maharajah Coomar Ramaput Sing, 1872 SCC OnLine PC 16 : (1871-72) 14 Moo IA 605 at page 612 126 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. The landlord, who is more than 70 years of age as of now, had fi led a suit for eviction which ultimately resulted in a consent decree on 11.06.2005 where inter alia, it was stipulated that in case the debtors (i.e., tenants) fail to pay the rent for two consecutive months, they could be evicted as the decree would become liable for execution. 3. The tenants evidently committed a default in payment of rent, and on an application moved by the decree holder, the court vide its dated 12.02.2013 allowed the application holding that the decree holder/ appellant is entitled to execute the decree.
