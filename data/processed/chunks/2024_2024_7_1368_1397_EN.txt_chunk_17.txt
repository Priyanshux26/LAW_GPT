3273 of 1982, 3380 of 1982, 3400 of 1982, 3489 of 1982 and 4119 of 1982. 43. The issue before the Division Bench was in relation to extending pensionary and other benefits in respect of such employees who have been promoted on pensionable posts after 1982. According to the Division Bench, in other words, the issue is whether the cutoff date of 1982 fixed by the UPSRTC basing upon the provisions of absorption rules and the regulations framed thereunder are rational having nexus with the object of denying the benefit of pension to the members of the RKSP. 44. The Division Bench has referred to two GOs dated 07.06.1972 and 05.07.1972. In the first GO, the Officers/employees of the Roadways and those working in the Transport Commissioner’s office and Head Office, whether permanent or temporary, shall be considered on deputation under existing terms and conditions of their service. After period of six months, the Corporation shall take steps for their formal appointment and prepare service rules and those who are willing to be absorbed shall be absorbed in the Corporation for which required number of posts, both permanent and temporary, shall be created. It was also provided in Clause (4) of the GO dated 07.06.1972 that on absorption their service conditions shall not be inferior to those under the Government immediately before the absorption and their tenure of government service shall be considered for their seniority, promotion, pay fixation, entitlement for leave and for the benefits of retirement in the same way as would have been under the Government service. 45. In the second GO dated 05.07.1992, the earlier GO dated 07.06.1972 was amended. The GO dated 05.07.1972 as is quoted in impugned 21 ‘RKSP’ [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1395 U.P. Roadways Retired Officials and Officers Association v. State of U.P. & Anr. passed in Special Appeal No. 780 (S/B) of 2013 has already been quoted in the preceding para 24. 46. The High Court referred to the above GOs as also the provisions of U.P. State Road Transport Corporation Employees (other than Officers) Service Regulations, 1981 to hold that in view of the clear provisions in the GOs that the Roadways employees sent on deputation shall enjoy the same service conditions and whenever rules are framed their service conditions shall not be inferior to the conditions as were available under the Government immediately before their absorption, therefore, in view of Regulation 39 of the Regulations, 1981 notified on 19.06.1981, the erstwhile employees of the Roadways who have been promoted on pensionable posts after 1982 are entitled for pension. 47. Ms. Garima Prasad, learned senior counsel appearing for the UPSRTC would argue that the High Court has completely misread the contents of GOs dated 07.06.1972 and 05.07.1972 as also the rules and regulations. She would submit that these GOs have not made any specific provision concerning admissibility of pension which is dealt with in the earlier GO dated 28.10.1960. She would thus submit that GOs dated 07.06.1972 and 05.07.1972 would not be applicable to the employees of the erstwhile Roadways insofar as entitlement of pension is concerned and the same is restricted to the government employees who were absorbed in the services of the Corporation.
