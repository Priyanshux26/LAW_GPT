The fi rst suit was decreed on 30.10.2010. 5. During the pendency of the aforesaid suit, the respondent-plaintiff fi led the suit in question in January 2020 claiming liquidated damages of ₹1,28,90,000/- payable towards illegal occupation from 01.01.1998 till31.12.2019along with interest @ 12% per annum from 01.01.1998 till realization. Future damages @ ₹30,50,000/- per month from 01.01.2020 till the date of handing over vacant possession of the property in dispute were also claimed. It is the case of the parties that possession was handed over by the appellants to the respondent-plaintiff in June 2022. 6. The argument raised by learned senior counsel for the appellants is that from the pleadings in the fi rst suit fi led by the respondent-plaintiff it is evident that it had touched the issue of damages for use and occupation of the property in dispute, which could be claimed at that time, the lease having expired on 31.12.1997. However, still in the fi rst suit fi led in January 2006 only possession was sought. The relief, which was available and not claimed, is deemed to be omitted for which no fresh suit lies. The plaint in the suit in question fi led by the respondent-plaintiff in the year 2020 was liable to be rejected under VII Rule 11(d) C.P.C., as the same was not maintainable. In the suit fi led subsequently, the claim of the respondent- plaintiff is also barred by law for the reason that in the second suit fi led in the year 2020, the claim is made for damages for use and occupation from the year 1998 onwards. To appreciate the contentions raised by the appellants-defendants, copy of the earlier suit and the therein have been placed on record by the respondent-plaintiff along with the subsequent suit. It is not that any pleadings of the appellants-defendants are to be considered. He further referred to the provisions of II, Rules2(2), (3) and especially(4) C.P.C. in terms of which without even seeking permission of the court, relief for damages for use and occupation of the premises can be joined in a suit for recovery of immoveable property. M/S BHARAT PETROLEUM CORPORATION LTD. AND ANR. v. 863 ATM CONSTRUCTIONS PVT. LTD. [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] In support of his arguments, reliance was placed upon the of this Court in Virgo Industries (Eng.) Private Limited v. Venturetech Solutions Private Limited4. 7. On the other hand, Mr. S. Nagamuthu, leaned senior counsel for the respondent-plaintiff submitted that the application fi led by the appellants- defendants was totally mis-conceived. It is the undisputed fact on record that the lease granted to the appellants expired on 31.12.1997. Despite that, they did not hand over vacant physical possession of the property in dispute to the lesser- respondent, who had purchased the same on 03.01.1997. The respondent-plaintiff did not have any choice but to fi le the fi rst suit in 2006. In that also, all kinds of frivolous pleas were raised by the appellants making the respondent to contest the litigation for over a decade.
