It discussed the dichotomy between interpreting statutes based on their plain language versus applying purposive construction. According to the Court, when the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, it speaks for itself, and there is no need for further interpretation. The natural and ordinary meaning of words should prevail unless the legal context necessitates a different interpretation to align with the legislative intent or to avoid absurd outcomes. 15.4.1. The Court further elucidated that legislative intent should guide the interpretation of statutes, with all parts of a statute considered together to discern the overall purpose. It stressed that words and phrases within a statute must be construed in context, taking into account the legislative objectives and the broader framework of the law. This holistic approach ensures that statutory interpretation remains faithful to the lawmakers’ intentions and avoids inconsistencies or injustices that may arise from a literal reading of isolated provisions. 15.4.2. The High Court emphasized that Section 143A should be interpreted plainly, without resorting to other rules of interpretation. It asserted that the term ‘drawer’ in Section 143A has a clear and unambiguous meaning, referring specifically to the person who issues the cheque. Referring to the Statement of Objects and Purposes of the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2018, the High Court noted that the purpose of Section 143A is to provide interim relief to payees of dishonoured cheques by imposing liability on the drawer. This, according to the High Court, aligns with the legislative [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1219 Shri Gurudatta Sugars Marketing Pvt. Ltd. v. Prithviraj Sayajirao Deshmukh & Ors. intent to curb frivolous litigations and expedite resolution of cheque dishonour cases. 15.4.3. The High Court rejected the inclusion of authorized signatories within the definition of ‘drawer’. It pointed out that the legislature’s choice of words in Section 143A specifically targets the drawer of the cheque, whether an individual or a company, and does not extend liability to authorized signatories. Drawing from established legal precedents, the High Court underscored that the term ‘drawer’ carries a specific legal meaning within the NI Act. It highlighted the cases where Courts consistently interpreted ‘drawer’ to refer strictly to the issuer of the cheque, reinforcing its decision to uphold this interpretation. The High Court relied on the following s to emphasise on the literal interpretation warranted in the present case: i. Nazir Ahmad v. King Emperor4 ii. Central Bank of India v. Ravindra5 iii. Noor Mohammed v. Khurram Pasha6 15.4.4. Contextually, the High Court stressed upon the finding that ‘drawer’ within the framework of the NI Act consistently refers to the party issuing the cheque. It dismissed the arguments seeking to expand this definition to include authorized signatories, citing the need for consistency in statutory interpretation. 15.4.5. The High Court also invoked principles of company law to support its interpretation. It affirms the separate legal identity of a company and its authorized signatories under the Companies Act, which prevents extending liability to signatories under Section 143A. 16. In conclusion, the High Court’s analysis underscores the critical distinction between individuals acting as authorized signatories and the legal entities they represent under the NI Act.
