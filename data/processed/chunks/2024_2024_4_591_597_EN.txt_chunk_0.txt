[Paras 3, 9] Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Special Court – Cognizance – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 200 to s. 204 – Procedure thereof: * Author 592 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: The only mode by which the cognizance of the offence under Section 3, punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA, can be taken by the Special Court is upon a complaint filed by the Authority authorized on this behalf – Section 46 of PMLA provides that the provisions of the Cr.PC shall apply to proceedings before a Special Court and for the purposes of the Cr.PC provisions, the Special Court shall be deemed to be a Court of Sessions – However, sub- section (1) of Section 46 starts with the words “save as otherwise provided in this Act” – Considering the provisions of Section 46(1) of the PMLA, save as otherwise provided in the PMLA, the provisions of the Cr.PC shall apply to the proceedings before a Special Court – Therefore, once a complaint is filed before the Special Court, the provisions of Sections 200 to 204 of the Cr.PC will apply to the Complaint – There is no provision in the PMLA which overrides the provisions of Sections 200 to Sections 204 of Cr.PC – Hence, the Special Court will have to apply its mind to the question of whether a prima facie case of a commission of an offence under Section 3 of the PMLA is made out in a complaint under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA – If the Special Court is of the view that no prima facie case of an offence under Section 3 of the PMLA is made out, it must exercise the power under Section 203 of the Cr.PC to dismiss the complaint – If a prima facie case is made out, the Special Court can take recourse to Section 204 of the Cr.PC.
