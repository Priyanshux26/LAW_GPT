As the next premium was not paid, the policy lapsed. The assured paid the next premium on 25.02.2014 and the lapsed policy was reinstated from that date. On 03.06.2014, the life assured committed suicide. 5. The Clause relevant for consideration is clause 9 of the Policy conditions and privileges and the terms and conditions mentioned therein. Clause 9 reads as follows: “9. Suicide: The Company will not pay any claim on death if the Life Assured, whether sane or insane, commits suicide within 12 months from the date of issue of this Policy or the date of any reinstatement of this Policy.” 6. From the documents on record in the case of Usha Soni, we find that the first cheque was issued on 26.09.2012. The policy issuance and commencement date in the Policy is mentioned as 28.09.2012. Further, the next premium due was on 28.09.2013. Grace period is 30 days under Clause 1(iv) of the terms and conditions. Clause 5 mentions that the policy would lapse. Clause 6 provides for reinstatement. However, since the renewal amount was not paid within the time allowed, the policy stood lapsed and subsequently, upon payment of the premium against the lapsed policy on 25.02.2014, the policy was reinstated from the said date. The life assured committed suicide on 03.06.2014, which was well within the period of 12 months. 7. On a perusal of the s passed by the District Forum, the State Commission, and the National Commission, we find that although clause 9 of the terms and conditions has been referred to but the aspect of reinstatement of a lapsed Policy has not been considered. They have wrongly taken the date of issue of policy only as the relevant date to count 12 months, i.e., from 28.09.2012. 8. Once it is mentioned in the Policy that the 12 months period is to commence from the date of the issuance of the policy or the date of any reinstatement of the policy, the reinstatement aspect ought to have [2024] 1 S.C.R. 69 RELIANCE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY LTD. & ANR. v. JAYA WADHWANI been considered. The date of reinstatement of the policy is clearly stated to be 25.02.2014 and that is also the date of commencement of policy, both the dates being the same. Thus, the date of incidence of suicide being 03.06.2014, it was well within 12 months. 9. Now, coming to the case of Jaya Wadhwani, the proposal form, no doubt, was submitted on 14.07.2012 with respect to the cheque dated 13.07.2012 of the premium amount wherein also it was mentioned that the receipt is issued subject to the clearance of the cheque and further that the insurance protection shall only be provided effective from the date of acceptance of the risk, which happened on 16.07.2012, when the policy was issued and the date of commencement was notified to be the same date. 10. 14th July 2012, therefore, cannot be taken to be the date of issuance of policy. It is only the date of issue of receipt of the initial premium.
