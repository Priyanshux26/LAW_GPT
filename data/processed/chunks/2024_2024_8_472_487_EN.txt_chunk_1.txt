The matters pertain to the issue whether or not the principle of stepping up of pay of an employee on the basis of the pay of his junior, is applicable in the present case, where the appellants are put on a lesser pay scale than the Assistant Professors who were appointed before them as ad hoc lecturers and subsequently regularized. The genesis of controversy goes back to the period of 1984-95 when 111 persons came to be engaged as Lecturers on ad hoc basis in various Government Colleges. The University Grants Commission1 has framed the Regulations of 1998, inter alia, providing for minimum length of service of four years for lecturers (Assistant Professor) with PhD and M. Phil and of six years for others to be eligible to move to Senior Scale (i.e., 10000-325-15200) and on completion of another five years of service, for being eligible to move to Selection Grade (i.e., 12000-420-18300). The said regulations also provided for counting of services during ad hoc period for grant of Senior Scale and Selection Grade Pay. 4. In view of the above regulations, the Education Department, issued a Government Resolution dated 17.06.1999 for considering previous services rendered by the ad hoc lecturers for the purpose of their placement in Senior Scale/Selection Grade. Subsequent to the said Resolution, the Government provided benefits to some of the ad hoc lecturers subject to conditions as provided therein. In 2001, some other ad hoc lecturers [1984-95 Group] approached the High Court for regularization of their services. However, the said Special Civil Application was dismissed against which LPA No. 485 of 2002 was preferred. 5. In the year 2001 itself, the appellants in the instant case came to be directly selected and appointed as Assistant Professors by the Gujarat Public Service Commission.2 1 UGC, hereinafter 2 GPSC, hereinafter [2024] 8 S.C.R. 475 Maheshkumar Chandulal Patel & Anr. v.
