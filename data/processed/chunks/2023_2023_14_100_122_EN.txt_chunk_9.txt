8. However, much water has fl own under the bridge since the year 2013. In the year 2020, a three-judges Bench of this Court answered a Reference of a Division Bench in Tofan Singh v. State of Tamil Nadu42 and re-examined the ratio of Kanhaiyalal33 (supra) and Raj Kumar Karwal35 (supra) to decide as to whether the offi cer investigating a matter under the NDPS Act would qualify as a ‘police offi cer’ or not. The other related issue which was examined by the larger Bench in Tofan Singh36 (supra) was whether the statement recorded by the investigating offi cer under Section 67 of the NDPS Act can be treated as a confessional statement or not even if the offi cer is not treated as a “police offi cer”. 9. After a detailed examination of the legal position in the light of the provisions of the NDPS Act, vis-à-vis revenue Statutes like the Customs Act, 1962 and the Central Excise Act, 1944 as also the Cr.P.C and Section 25 of the Evidence Act, the majority decision authored by Justice Nariman, arrived at the following conclusion: “155. Thus, to arrive at the conclusion that a confessional statement made before an offi cer designated under Section 42 or Section 53 can be the basis to convict a person under the NDPS Act, without any non obstante clause doing away with Section 25 of the Evidence Act, and without any safeguards, would be a direct infringement of the constitutional guarantees contained in Articles 14, 20(3) and 21 of the Constitution of India. 42 (2013) 16 SCC 31 114 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. 156. The in Kanhaiyalal [Kanhaiyalal v. Union of India, (2008) 4 SCC 668 : (2008) 2 SCC (Cri) 474] then goes on to follow Raj Kumar Karwal [Raj Kumar Karwal v. Union of India, (1990) 2 SCC 409 : 1990 SCC (Cri) 330] in paras 44 and 45. For the reasons stated by us hereinabove, both these s do not state the law correctly, and are thus overruled by us. Other s that expressly refer to and rely upon these s, or upon the principles laid down by these s, also stand overruled for the reasons given by us. 157. On the other hand, for the reasons given by us in this , the s of Noor Aga [Noor Aga v. State of Punjab, (2008) 16 SCC 417 : (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 748] and Nirmal Singh Pehlwan v. Inspector, Customs [Nirmal Singh Pehlwan v. Inspector, Customs, (2011) 12 SCC 298 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 555] are correct in law. 158. We answer the reference by stating: 158.1. That the offi cers who are invested with powers under Section 53 of the NDPS Act are “police offi cers” within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act, as a result of which any confessional statement made to them would be barred under the provisions of Section 25 of the Evidence Act, and cannot be taken into account in to convict an accused under the NDPS Act.
