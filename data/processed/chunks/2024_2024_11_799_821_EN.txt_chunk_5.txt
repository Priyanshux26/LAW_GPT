807 State Bank of India & Ors. v. Navin Kumar Sinha void-ab-initio. He had assailed the of penalty on various other grounds including on merit. Therefore, the High Court was not justified in allowing the challenge of the respondent on the unpleaded ground that the departmental proceeding was initiated against him after his superannuation. This aspect was also overlooked by the Division Bench. 12.3. Referring to the stand taken by the respondent in the departmental enquiry as well as before the appellate authority that he was due to superannuate on 30.10.2012, Mr. Singh submits that the same is binding on him. In fact, appellant bank had paid subsistence allowance to the respondent even after 01.10.2010 right upto the date of dismissal from service which the respondent had accepted. Therefore, it is not open to the respondent to now contend that his service with the appellant bank had come to an end on 01.10.2010. 12.4. Learned senior counsel also referred to Rule 19 of the Service Rules more particularly to sub-Rule (2) thereof and contends that there cannot be any automatic superannuation of an officer from the service of the appellant bank. Superannuation of an officer has to be sanctioned by the competent authority under Rule 19(2) of the Service Rules. 12.5. Finally, Mr. Singh, learned senior counsel submits that the departmental proceeding against the respondent was initiated before he had retired from service. Therefore, in terms of the Rule 19(3) of the Service Rules, respondent was deemed to have continued in service of the appellant bank for the purpose of such departmental proceeding. In this connection, he has placed reliance on the decision of this Court in SBI Vs. C.B. Dhall.1 13. Per contra, Mr. Vishwajit Singh, learned senior counsel for the respondent, submits that there is no error or infirmity in the impugned decision of the High Court. 13.1. Learned senior counsel submits that the issue involved in the present case is quite simple: whether the appellant bank could have initiated disciplinary proceeding against the respondent after his superannuation. 1 [1997] Supp. 6 SCR 416 : (1998) 2 SCC 544 808 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 13.2. He submits that respondent had completed 30 years of service in the appellant bank in the year 2003. Therefore in terms of Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules, he was due to superannuate on 26.12.2003. However, the appellant bank invoked the proviso to Rule 19(1) of the Service Rules and by recording reasons in writing extended the service of the respondent beyond 30 years from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. Thereafter, no further extension of service was granted by the appellant bank. As such, the respondent’s service in the appellant bank had ceased with effect from 01.10.2010. 13.3. Though appellant bank had issued notice dated 18.08.2009 to the respondent alleging irregularities and had suspended him from service on 21.08.2009, departmental proceeding was initiated against the respondent in terms of Rule 68(1) of the Service Rules only on 18.03.2011 when the charge memo was issued, which was clearly after 01.10.2010.
