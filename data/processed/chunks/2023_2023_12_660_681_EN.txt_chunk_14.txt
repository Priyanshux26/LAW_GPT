60. At this stage, we may notice that, though Section 19 of the 1957 Act declared that nothing contained in the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 or the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 or the Factories Act, 1948 or any corresponding law relating to investigation and settlement of industrial dispute in force in a State shall apply to members of the Force (RPF), there is no exclusion of the applicability of the provisions of the 1923 Act. 61. In light of the discussion above, we are of the considered view that despite declaring RPF as armed force of the Union, the legislative intent was not to take it out of the purview of the 1923 Act. Issue no. (i) is decided in terms above. Issue No. (ii): Whether, on account of availability of alternative remedy to apply for compensation under Sections 124 and 124-A of the 1989 Act, a claim under the 1923 Act is maintainable? 62. The answer to issue no. (ii) lies in Section 128 of the 1989 Act. According to which, notwithstanding the right to claim compensation under Section 124 or Section 124-A of the 1989 Act, the right of a person to claim compensation under the 1923 Act, or any other law for the time being in COMMANDING OFFICER, RAILWAY PROTECTION SPECIAL FORCE, 681 MUMBAI v. BHAVNABEN DINSHBHAI BHABHOR & OTHERS [MANOJ MISRA, J.] force, is specifi cally saved subject to the condition that he shall not be entitled to claim compensation more than once in respect of the same accident. 63. In the instant case, there is nothing to indicate that the respondents’ claim under the 1923 Act was made after receiving compensation for the same accident under any other Act or law. Hence, the application under the 1923 Act was not barred on account of there being an alternative remedy under the 1989 Act. Issue no. (ii) is decided accordingly. 64. For the reasons detailed above and in view of our answer to the issues framed above, we hold that the claim set up by the respondents under the 1923 Act was maintainable. The appeal lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed. The interim , if any, stands discharged. Parties to bear their own costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal dismissed. Divya Pandey
