164. But the Explanation under Section 90 makes it clear that no custody is improper if it is proved to have had a legitimate origin or the circumstances of the particular case are such as to render such an origin E probable. 165. In any case, the learned Judge was not dealing with a title suit. Assuming that the claim petitioners could not produce documents to prove flow of title, they were admittedly in possession and they were sought to be dispossessed through the District Court, Ranga Reddy District. F 166. When the entire claim of the appellants that the properties were Mathruka properties inheritable by the legal heirs had failed, the question of executing a decree on the strength of the plea that the property is a Mathruka property does not arise. G 167. It was argued by the learned senior counsel for the appellants that the High Court wrongly relied upon sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 86 of the Hyderabad Land Revenue Act, 1317 F. (1907 A.D.) to provide pattadar status to the claimants. It was pointed out by the learned senior counsel that sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 86 were omitted by the A.P. Adaptation , 1957. H M/s TRINITY INFRAVENTURES LTD. & ORS. ETC. v. M. S. 357 MURTHY & ORS. ETC. [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] 168. But the above argument does not advance the cause of the A appellants. The moment the claim of the appellants that it was a Mathruka property fails, the appellants lose their claim to property. It is only after they establish successfully their claim to title, that the burden shifts on the claimants. 169. An original Map of Hydernagar verified by the Survey and B Land Records Department was sought to be produced before us to show that the land in Survey No.172 could not have been sub-divided into 24/ 25 parts in the year 1978-79, as contended by the claim petitioners. But this Map, secured recently, was not before the learned Single Judge or the Division Bench. Therefore, we cannot look into the same to test the C correctness of the impugned . 170. Moreover, the argument that Survey No.172 could not have been sub-divided into 24/25 parts in the year 1978 is a self-defeating one. While setting up a claim to title, some of the appellants and their predecessors relied upon a report of the Receiver-cum-Commissioner D and an passed by the Trial Judge in Application No.139 of 1971 dated 31.01.1976. It was under this document that defendant Nos.50, 51 and 52 as well as defendant No.116 claimed title to some portions of the land sub-divided in Survey No.172.It is true that Cyrus/Goldstone/Trinity did not rely upon the in Application No.139 of 1971. They claim title from defendant Nos.157 and 206 but their claim could be traced E only to the scheme of partition prepared by the Receiver-cum- Commissioner. It was either based upon the division purportedly made by the Revenue Divisional Officer under s of the Collector in terms of Section 54 CPC or on the basis of the scheme submitted by the Receiver-cum-Commissioner.
