He would also be aware of the Bipartite Agreement and the consequences mentioned therein of his absence from duty. In the aforesaid letter, the workman had mentioned that from January 1984, his subsistence allowance had not been paid resulting in mental torture to him. His idea seemed to be to remain in practice of law and at the same time enjoy payment of subsistence allowance without working. The language of the letter also clearly suggests that the workman was legally trained. 12. His over-smartness is evident further from the contents of his letter where he claimed that as a consequence of non-payment of subsistence allowance, he had to pass his life on open road and his address for communication had been lost, thus making sure that he could take a plea that none of the communications from the Bank were received by him. In his subsequent letter dated 08.02.1984, in response to letters from the Bank dated 05.01.1984, 09.01.1984 and 30.01.1984, he again raised the issue regarding non-payment of his subsistence allowance but did not mention his address. He stated that he could not be compelled to report for duty at the Branch Offi ce, Bhagwantnagar, Unnao. The aforesaid communication from the workman clearly establishes the fact that he was in the know of the letters issued by the Bank to him regarding his voluntary absence from duty for over 90 days. He was directed to report for duty to the Manager, Branch Offi ce, Bhagwantnagar, Unnao vide dated 28.09.1983, but instead of submitting his joining, he continued corresponding with the Bank. 13. The conduct of the workman is further evident from the communication dated 06.03.1984, addressed by him to the Chairman of the Bank informing that he had gone on hunger strike from 06.03.1984 onwards on account of non-redressal of his grievances. Yet, he was smart enough not to furnish his address in the said letter. Though the period of 90 days had already expired after 28.09.1983 and the workman was U.P. SINGH v. PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK 901 absenting from duty without any application despite repeated notices served upon him, still a notice was sent by the Bank to the workman at his last known two addresses on 05.10.1984 referring to Clause XVI of the Bipartite Agreement specifi cally stating that in case of his failure to join duty within 30 days, he shall be deemed to have voluntarily retired from service. 14. Notice was also published in Lucknow and Allahabad Editions of North India Patrika on 08.10.1984. This was done as an abundant caution as the workman had not been furnishing his address in any of his communication though had been corresponding with the Bank. He was well aware of the communications sent by the Bank even after the aforesaid notice was issued to him. He sent another letter to the Bank on 17.10.1984, claiming payment of subsistence allowance from January 1984 onwards. He sent yet another letter dated 18.10.1984 to the Branch Manager, Shahjahanpur informing that in case any communication is received in his name from any other offi ce, the same may be served upon him but strangely enough he did not mention at what address.
