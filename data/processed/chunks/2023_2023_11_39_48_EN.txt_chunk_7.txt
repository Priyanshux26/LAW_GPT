This Court proceeded to observe that a Judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. Both are public duties. The law does not enjoin a duty on the prosecution to lead evidence of such character, which is almost impossible to be led, or at any rate, extremely diffi cult to be led. The duty on the prosecution is to lead such evidence, which it is capable of leading, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case. 30. In such circumstances referred to above, we are of the view that we should not disturb the impugned and passed by the High Court. 31. Accordingly the appeals are dismissed. 32. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals dismissed. Bibhuti Bhushan Bose
