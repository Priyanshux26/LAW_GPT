This omission was however overlooked which definitely was disappointing for those who failed to qualify in the written test. Since things can’t be undone, we expect all concerned to be mindful of their responsibility in future recruitments, to preserve the answer scripts till the selection process is successfully completed, to obviate similar such allegation of wrong doings. 10. As can be seen, the High Court condoned the allegation made by the writ petitioner(s) in Writ Petition (C) No.815 of 2011 about the selection being vitiated by publication of names of the selected candidates in the local newspaper, well before the official declaration of result. The learned judge concluded that this by itself will not warrant interference with the selection process. With such findings, the Writ Petition (C) No.815 of 2011 was partly allowed and the recommendation of the Review DPC, the notification dated 04.09.2011 and the related Government , were set aside with direction to the State-respondents to constitute a Review DPC to submit fresh recommendation strictly in accordance with the Notification dated 12.09.2006. The recommendations were directed to confine to only the unreserved, SC and ST categories. The candidates shortlisted in the OBC category were directed to be excluded altogether from the fresh select list. 11. The Writ Petition (C) No.620 of 2011 filed by the appellant Khunjamayum Bimoti Devi was disposed of on 29.03.2016 with the declaration that her case is covered by the and dated 6.10.2015 in the W.P (C) No.815 of 2011 and W.P (C) No.127 of 2012. This of the High Court is under challenge in the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (Civil) No. 15482 of 2016. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 29 Khunjamayum Bimoti Devi v. The State of Manipur & Ors. 12. When the challenge to the High Court dated 06.10.2015 came to be considered by this Court, an affidavit dated 11.03.2016 came to be filed on behalf of the State of Manipur, by Mr. H. Daleep Singh, Commissioner (Education/S). The said affidavit being of some relevance, is extracted herein below:- “An Affidavit on behalf of the Respondent No.4 I, H. Deleep Singh, IAS, now serving as Commissioner (Education/S) Government of Manipur, have gone through the contents of the I.A.
