However, “the CCTV video footage(s)/clip(S) having date stamp i.e. 13.12.2023 to 16.12.2023 were not found in the Hard disk Exh-H1 of the DVR Exh-1”. 32. Going by the above averments, it is clear that the mandate to install and ensure functionality of CCTV cameras in all police stations by virtue of this Court’s in the case of Paramvir Singh Saini(supra) has not been complied in letter and spirit by the concerned police officials. Even if we accept the fact that CCTV cameras were installed in some parts of Vesu Police Station and it is the DVR which was not functional, the fact remains that no CCTV camera was installed in the interrogation room of the police station which is an admitted position as evident from the record. However, we feel that these shortcomings should be dealt with at the departmental level rather than being made subject of these contempt proceedings. The contempt notice issued to contemnor-respondent No.3 is thus, discharged. 33. The language of the remand application filed by the Investigating Officer, Shri R.Y. Raval(contemnor-respondent No.4) would be relevant for dealing with his case and hence, the same is reproduced hereinbelow: - “To 5th Additional Senior Civil Judge and Additional Civil Judicial Magistrate, New Court Building, Surat City 268 [2024] 8 S.C.R.
