29. Shri Ajay Kumar Tomar, Commissioner of Police, Surat (contemnor- respondent No. 2) had no role to play in the investigation or the proceedings pertaining to the remand of the petitioner and thus, prima facie, he cannot be held responsible for the contumacious 266 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports acts. His role is limited to the aspect of non-functionality of the CCTV cameras, and we would be dealing with this aspect later. The contempt notice issued to contemnor-respondent No.2 is thus, discharged. 30. Shri Vijaysinh Gurjar, contemnor-respondent No. 3 being the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone-4, Surat has sworn an affidavit tendering unconditional apology for any of the acts/omissions which may have led to the of this Court being flouted. 31. We may note that the reply affidavit of this Officer (contemnor- respondent No.3) is relevant only in context of non-functioning of the CCTV cameras and the custodial torture allegedly meted out to the petitioner during police custody for the period between 13th December, 2023 and 16th December, 2023, wherein it is alleged that the petitioner was beaten in the presence of the said contemnor. The following averments are made in the reply affidavit filed by contemnor-respondent No. 3:- 31.1 At para 6 of the reply affidavit, it has been stated that the respondent was busy in the preparation and deployment on account of visit of the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India in Surat on 17th December, 2023. In connection with the said preparations, he had briefly visited Vesu Police Station on 13th December, 2023. He has denied having any role to play in the investigation of the FIR lodged against the petitioner. The issue regarding custodial violence allegedly meted out to the petitioner is subject matter of departmental proceedings and is also sub judice in proceedings of the criminal complaint filed by the petitioner. Thus, it is neither necessary nor justified to make any observation thereupon because the said aspect has no live link to the contempt proceedings. 31.2 Regarding the aspect of non-functioning of CCTV cameras installed at Vesu Police Station and storage thereof, the contemnor-respondent No. 3 has come out with the following details in para 7 of the reply affidavit:- 7. “That in so far as the CCTV footage of the Vesu Police Station for the period 13.12.2023 to 16.12.2023 is concerned, it is humbly that my office [2024] 8 S.C.R. 267 Tusharbhai Rajnikantbhai Shah v.
