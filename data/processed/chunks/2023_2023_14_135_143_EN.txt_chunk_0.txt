[2023] 14 S.C.R. 135 : 2023 INSC 960 CASE DETAILS SUDHIR SINGH AND OTHERS v. STATE OF U.P. AND OTHERS (Civil Appeal No. 7069 of 2023) OCTOBER 30, 2023 [VIKRAM NATH AND AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Claims of the appellants for recruitment on the posts of Village Development Offi cers if rightly rejected by High Court in view of lack of eligibility of being Ex-Servicemen at the time of the advertisement in question. Service Law – Basic eligibility/qualifi cation – To be adjudged as on the last date of submission of application forms, subject to any extension of such date: Held: Basic question on eligibility has to be determined on the basis of the cut-off date/point of time which stands crystalized by the date of the advertisement itself, being the last date of submission of application forms, unless extended by the authority concerned – In the present case, none of the appellants can be said to have been Ex-Servicemen at the time of the advertisement in question, as, undisputedly, they were still in service – Relevant rules and even the clarifi cation(s) to the advertisement do not indicate that the appellants can be deemed Ex-Servicemen from a prospective date, despite being in actual service on the relevant date – As such, in the case at hand, there is no concept of serving personnel being deemed Ex-Servicemen – Also, the advertisement clearly specifi ed a Course of Computer Concept as the essential qualifi cation however, the appellants despite opportunity to appear to show such equivalence, failed to do so – Impugned upheld. [Paras 14, 15, 17-19] Service Law – Certification given to a person indicating a prospective date till when he would be in employment, such date 135 136 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. indicated if can be taken as the date of being fi nally and actually relieved from service: Held: No – Even if a certifi cation is given to a person indicating a prospective date till when he would be in employment, circumstances could intercede between the date of such certifi cate and the prospective date of retirement/resignation/relieving indicated therein – Illustratively, if for any reason there is a proceeding/charge pending against the person(s) concerned and/or there are circumstances for which the person cannot be relieved from his post till conclusion of such proceedings or otherwise, such date indicated in the certifi cate cannot be taken as the date of being fi nally and actually relieved from service – However, in the present case, such date is also prospective and much later to the date on which the applications were invited and even till the last date of submission of the application forms – Thus, on this count alone, the appellants’ claim of a right to consideration under the Ex-Servicemen category fails.
