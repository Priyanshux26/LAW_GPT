19.4.2. The relevant observations and findings of the Appellate H Tribunal in regard to this aspect read as under: - M. K. RAJAGOPALAN v. DR. PERIASAMY PALANI 825 GOUNDER & ANR. [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] “101. Resolution Applicants ineligibility u/s 29A(e) of the A Code………. *** *** *** 105. The CoC was merely informed that one of the PRA21 charitable trusts was not authorised to take up this activity. B However, the rejected Trust was none other than the 2nd Respondent’s Trust, namely ‘Balaji Vidyapeeth’, which was never disclosed to the COC and has been deliberately suppressed. The IRP/ Resolution Professional should have informed the CoC that the 2nd Respondent had presented the Resolution Plan by competing with the said Trust. He has used the very same ‘’Trust’ C to support his credentials and creditworthiness in the Resolution Plan. The relevant portions of the Resolution Plan are extracted hereunder for ready reference: “3.5. Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth: Mr M.K. Rajagopalan is the founder and managing trustee D of Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth... 3.10. Financial Snapshot” The entities under the leadership of Mr. M.K. Rajagopalan have been growing rapidly while ensuring quality of service E to nation and public at large... These entities have achieved turnover of Rs.417.94 Crores in FY 2016-2017; Rs.500.03 Crores in FY 2017-2018; Rs. 679.23 Crores in FY 2018-2019 and Rs.860.59 Crores (estimated) for FY 2019-2020. F The above growth is ample testimony of the credentials of the RA as a competent business leader and his capability to manage and turn around various diverse businesses.” 106. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the 2nd Respondent has not gained any advantage from the charitable Trust. The case on G hand squarely falls within the ambit of Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act, and as such, the Resolution Plan is illegal. Since the said ‘Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth’ has already been declared as ineligible, the 2nd Respondent cannot act as its alter ego in implementing 21 Prospective Resolution Applicant. H 826 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A the Resolution Plan and attain any financial advantage or gain is barred by Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act. The said provision is extracted hereunder for ready reference.22 *** *** *** 108. It is illogical and fallacious to claim that the Resolution Plan B can be tested in terms of the provisions of IBC, 2016 and not under Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act. Therefore, it is submitted that even as per the provisions of IBC, a Resolution Plan shall be by the provisions of all other statutes, and the Resolution Plan mustn’t contravene the law of the land. In this regard, it is pertinent C to note Sections 30 and 61 of the Code, which reads as follows: “Section 30. Submission of Resolution Plan. – (2) The Resolution professional shall examine each resolution plan received by him to confirm that each resolution plan – … D (e) does not contravene any of the provisions of the law for the time being in force.
