The High Court also ignored the correct enunciation of the applicable law in the dated 18.04.2018, whereunder the respondents were directed to report at their parental zones as per the guidelines. As there is no dispute about the applicability of Section 82 even at the bar, the submission of Mr. G.V.R. Choudary that the modalities for allocation have not been decided cannot be accepted in light of the Agenda Note dated 16.08.2017. 15. We have also gone through the prayer in the writ petition of Mr. V.V. Brahma Reddy (respondent no. 1 in Civil Appeal No. 5267/2024), under which there is no challenge to the Agenda Note and its approval. The division bench of the High Court failed to note that the respondents who were on deputation were not absorbed in the deputed posts. In fact, their seniority is continued in their parental zones. 16. The High Court also did not consider the subsequent development when the respondents were in fact repatriated to their parent cadre as a consequence of the passed by the division bench on 18.04.2018. It is for this reason that this Court had, at the stage of [2024] 9 S.C.R. 85 Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation & Ors. v. V.V. Brahma Reddy & Anr. admission, stayed the of the division bench on 05.10.2020, which stay is continuing till date. The consequence is that the respondents have returned to this parent cadre in the State of Telangana. 17. For the reasons as indicated hereinabove, the decision of the division bench is unsustainable. We therefore, allow Civil Appeal Nos. 5267, 5268, 5269, 5270, 5271, 5272, 5273, 5274, 5275, 5276, 5277, 5278, 5279, 5280, 5281, 5282, 5283, 5284, 5285, 5286, 5287, 5288, 5289, 5290 and 5291 of 2024 and set aside the and passed by the High Court in Writ Appeal Nos. 260, 290, 291, 292, 303, 304, 306, 311, 312, 313, 318, 320, 321, 322, 323, 325, 328, 329, 354, 355, 356, 360, 386, 389 and 568 of 2018 dated 21.11.2019 and dismiss the Writ Petition Nos. 25880, 25881, 25886, 25196, 25198, 25201, 25214, 24825, 24849, 24870, 24872, 24874, 24891, 24941, 24987, 25139, 25170, 24605, 24609, 24690, 24697, 24723, 24773, 489 and 6065 of 2017 dated 10.11.2017. 18. There shall be no as to costs. Result of the case: Matters disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
