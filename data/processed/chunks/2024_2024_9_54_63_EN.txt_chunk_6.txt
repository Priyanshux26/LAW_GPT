This position is also admitted by the Respondent-Agency in its Counter Affidavit dated 19.04.2024. Moreover, the said was never challenged by the Revenue Authorities, and has, thus, attained finality. 22. Furthermore, the Appellant-Company had successfully claimed immunity from prosecution under the CA 1962, CE Act 1944, and IPC 1860 vide dated 21.08.2007. In such a circumstance, there was no fiscal liability on the Appellant-Company, and accordingly, the dated 01.08.2010 passed by learned Special Judge, taking cognizance against the Appellant-Company, ought not to have sustained. As the very basis of the allegation of offence against the Appellant-Company was found to be non-existent, it would have amounted to misuse rather abuse of the process of law. It may be added here that the prosecution sanction as sought against the [2024] 9 S.C.R. 63 Baccarose Perfumes and Beauty Products Pvt. Ltd v. Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr. officials of KASEZ, who were said to have committed the offences under PCA 1988, stood declined. In the light of this additional fact, the application for discharge, as moved by the Appellant-Company, ought to have been accepted by the learned Special Judge. 23. In light of the above, the present Appeal is allowed. The proceedings against the Appellant-Company are quashed by setting aside the Impugned dated 15.09.2023 passed by the High Court of Gujarat in CRA No. 783 of 2017 and the dated 01.06.2010 passed by the Special Judge in RC6(A)/2005. 24. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal Allowed †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
