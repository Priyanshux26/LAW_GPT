48. Per contra, Mr. Rakesh Khanna, learned senior counsel appearing for RKSP would submit that the High Court has correctly applied the GOs as also the rules and regulations while allowing the writ petition. He would also submit that the Division Bench has erred in directing, in the operative part of the , that the pension shall be calculated from the date, employee(s) of the Corporation became member of the cadre of the post which is pensionable. According to him, the entire length of service should have been calculated for the purpose of pensionary benefits. 49. We have already discussed the legal effect of the GOs dated 07.06.1972 and 05.07.1972 read along with Clause (4) of Regulation 39 of the Regulations, 1981. To reiterate, only those employees of the State Government working in the Roadways who have opted for services of the Corporation shall be entitled for pension and other 1396 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports retirement benefits in terms of GO dated 05.07.1972. However, other employees of the Corporation shall not be entitled to pension, but they shall be entitled to the retirement benefits mentioned in sub- Regulations (1) and (2) of Regulation 39. Thus, it is amply clear that only State Government employees absorbed in the Corporation shall be entitled to pension, “phrase that their service conditions shall not be inferior to the conditions as were available under the Government” would be applicable to the State Government employees for the purposes of according benefit of pension. The employees of Roadways who were not holding any pensionable post prior to their deputation or absorption in the Corporation, are not entitled to pension, as their service conditions in the erstwhile Roadways did not provide that they are entitled to pension. Thus, they have not been put to any inferior service conditions on their joining the services in the Corporation. In our considered opinion, the Division Bench of the High Court was not correct in holding that the members of the RKSP are entitled to pension even if they have been promoted after the cutoff date of 27.08.1982. 50. Insofar as the employees who were promoted in the UPSRTC on a pensionable post between 1972 to 1981, they are getting pension in view of GO dated 03.02.1984. This position has been admitted by Ms. Garima Prasad, learned senior counsel appearing for the UPSRTC. However, the members of the Union of RKSP for whose benefit the writ petition was preferred, who were promoted on a pensionable post after the cutoff date, are not entitled for pension. 51. Accordingly, we set aside the passed by the Division Bench and the learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court under the impugned (s). Accordingly, the appeals filed by UPSRTC being C.A. No. 895 of 2020, C.A. No. 896 of 2020, C.A. No. 897 of 2020, C.A. No. 898 of 2020 and C.A. No. (s) ________ of 2024 @ SLP (c) __________of 2024 @ Diary No. 10240 of 2020 are allowed and the appeals filed by Roadways Karamchari Sanyukta Parishad, UP being C.A.
