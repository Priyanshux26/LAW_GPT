[Para 16] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – s.9 – Duty of the Court in confi rming its own jurisdiction – Discussed – Maxims – “actus curiae neminem gravabit”. Practice and Procedure – Specialized forum under a statute, exclusion of a civil court: Held: When a specialized forum is made available under a statute, a civil court should normally entertain a dispute which would otherwise not be amenable before the said forum – Therefore, rights and liabilities of the parties arising from an enactment ought to be adjudicated upon in tune with the mechanism provided thereunder – The provisions of the enactment ought to be given eff ect to through such forums and therefore to MUMTAZ YARUD DOWLA WAKF v. M/S BADAM 987 BALAKRISHNA HOTEL PVT. LTD. & ORS. the exclusion of a civil court whose jurisdiction is otherwise to be inferred – As a principle of law, the powers of the civil court, being plenary in nature, the onus lies on the party who contends that it lacks jurisdiction – However, this does not take away the duty of the civil court to check its own jurisdiction, more so when a specialized forum has come into being as a creature of a statute.
