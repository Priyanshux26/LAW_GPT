It can be expected that the arbitration in India is conducted in accordance with the following views expressed by Justice Sabyasachi Mukharji in the case of Food Corporation of India (supra): 19 LAW COMMISSION OF INDIA Report No. 246 Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996, pg. 43 H 20 Paragraph No. 24, Report No. 246, Law Commission of India. M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 409 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [AJAY RASTOGI, J.] “7.We should make the law of arbitration simple, less technical A and more responsible to the actual realities of the situation, but must be responsive to the canons of justice and fair play and make the arbitrator adhere to such process and norms which will create confidence, not only by doing justice between the parties, but by creating a sense that justice appears to have been done.” B The above discussed approach of the legislature has been acknowledged by this Court. 67. In the case of Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Limited21, this Court explained the scope and effect of the changes brought in by the 2015 amendment in the following words: C “48….. From a reading of Section 11(6-A), the intention of the legislature is crystal clear i.e. the court should and need only look into one aspect—the existence of an arbitration agreement. What are the factors for deciding as to whether there is an arbitration agreement is the next question. The resolution to that is simple— D it needs to be seen if the agreement contains a clause which provides for arbitration pertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the parties to the agreement… 59. The scope of the power under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act was considerably wide in view of the decisions in SBP and Co. E [SBP and Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] and BogharaPolyfab [National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. BogharaPolyfab (P) Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC 267. This position continued till the amendment brought about in 2015. After the amendment, all that the courts need to see is whether an arbitration agreement exists— nothing more, nothing less. The legislative policy and purpose is F essentially to minimise the Court’s intervention at the stage of appointing the arbitrator and this intention as incorporated in Section 11(6-A) ought to be respected.” (Emphasis added) 68. This position was affirmed by a three-judge bench in Mayavati G Trading Private Limited v. Pradyuat Deb Burman22: “10. This being the position, it is clear that the law prior to the 2015 Amendment that has been laid down by this Court, which 21 (2017) 9 SCC 729 22 (2019) 8 SCC 714 H 410 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A would have included going into whether accord and satisfaction has taken place, has now been legislatively overruled. This being the position, it is difficult to agree with the reasoning contained in the aforesaid [United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd., (2019) 5 SCC 362], as Section 11(6-A) is confined to the examination of the existence of an arbitration B agreement and is to be understood in the narrow sense as has been laid down in the in Duro Felguera, S.A.…,” (Emphasis added) 69.
