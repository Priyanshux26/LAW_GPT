17. We have already taken note of the fact that while commuting the capital sentence to life imprisonment, the High Court had lost sight of the fact that despite conviction under Section 376 (2) (i) and under Sections 3/4, Sections 5(d)/6 of the POCSO Act, no separate sentences were imposed on the petitioner for the offence under Section 3/4 and 5(m)/6 of the POCSO Act by the Trial Court, [2024] 1 S.C.R. 121 Bhaggi @ Bhagirath @ Naran v. The State of Madhya Pradesh evidently, only on the ground that capital sentence is imposed on the petitioner for the offence under Section 376 AB, IPC. However, it is a fact that the said aspect escaped the attention of the High Court. That apart, in terms of the provisions under Section 376 AB, IPC when a sentence of imprisonment for a term not less than 20 years which may extend upto life imprisonment is imposed, the convict is also liable to suffer a sentence of fine which shall be just and reasonable to meet the medical expenses and rehabilitation of the victim which we quantify as Rupees One Lakh and the same shall be paid to the victim with respect to the conviction under Section 363, IPC. In that regard also, there is absolutely no consideration in the impugned . 18. It is submitted by the learned counsel, with reference to paragraph 1 of the impugned that the in paragraph 35 of the impugned that the conviction and sentence under Section 366, IPC is maintained, can also be in relation to the conviction under Section 363, IPC and the sentence imposed therefor. 19. We fully endorse the said contention as paragraph 1 of the impugned itself would reveal that the High Court had actually taken into consideration the fact that the petitioner-convict was convicted only under Section 376 AB, IPC as amended by Act No.22 of 2018 and under Section 363 IPC. In such circumstances, the conviction and sentence imposed on the petitioner-convict is confirmed. We have taken note of the fact that though the petitioner-convict was convicted for the offence under Section 3/4 and 5 (m)/6 of the POCSO Act, no separate sentence was imposed on the petitioner-convict by the Trial Court taking note of the provision under Section 42 of the POCSO Act. The said provision reads thus:- “42. Alternate punishment.—Where an act or omission constitutes an offence punishable under this Act and also under sections 166A, 354A, 354B, 354C, 354D, 370, 370A, 375, 376, [376A, 376AB, 376B, 376C, 376D, 376DA, 376DB], [376E, section 509 of the Indian Penal Code or section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000)], then, notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, the offender found guilty of such offence shall be liable to punishment only under this Act or under the Indian Penal Code as provides for punishment which is greater in degree.” 122 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 20. Since, even after the interference with the sentence imposed for the conviction of the petitioner-convict under Section 376 AB, IPC and modified sentence imposed on commutation by the High Court, we have awarded 30 years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rupees One Lakh, no separate sentence for the aforesaid offence under POCSO Act is to be imposed on the petitioner-convict.
