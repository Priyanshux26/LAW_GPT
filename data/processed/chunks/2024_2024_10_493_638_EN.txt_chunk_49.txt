In 1908, the Criminal Tribes Settlement Act was passed, “permitting the various provincial governments of India to make plans whereby tribes suspected of living by crime could be registered and supervised by the police, and those members of criminal tribes which had been convicted could be placed in settlements.”164 160 Criminal Tribes (Lower Provinces) Act Extension Act, 1876 161 Ibid 162 The Criminal Tribes Enquiry Committee Report (1949-50), https://ia802807.us.archive.org/11/items/dli. csl.944/944.pdf, p. 5 163 Ibid 164 John Lewis Gillin, Taming the Criminal: Adventures in Penology, Macmillan Company (1931), p. 110 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 565 Sukanya Shantha v.

The application of the Criminal Tribes Act was extended to the whole of British India.165 The Act amended the law relating to the registration, surveillance, and control of criminal tribes. It strengthened the power of the local government to declare any community as a “criminal tribe” without having to seek permission of any higher authority.166 However, the local government was still required to take s from the Governor General if it wanted to restrict the movements of any criminal tribe to any specified area or settle them in any place of residence.167 106. The 1911 amendment gave additional powers to the district magistrate or any officer to finger-impressions of a registered member of the designated tribe.168 The individuals belonging to such tribes were required to inform “any change or intended change of residence and any absence or intended absence from his residence”.169 Further, the 1911 Act reinforced the provisions for the registration of the members of the designated criminal tribes with the authorities170 and regular reporting.171 Similarly, the Act reiterated the “duty” of “every village-headman and village-watchman” and landowners to check the activities of these individuals.172 107. The Act also provided that the criminal tribes could be placed in any “industrial, agricultural, or reformatory settlements” to restrict their movements.173 The local government was also allowed to “separate and remove” children (between 6 and 18 years of age) from their parents or guardians and place them in any “established industrial, agricultural or reformatory schools”.174 These children were deemed as “youthful offenders” under Reformatory Schools Act, 165 Section 1(2), Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 166 Section 3, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 167 Section 11, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 168 Section 5(c), Section 9, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 169 Section 10 (b), Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 170 Section 5, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 171 Section 14, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 172 Section 26, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 173 Section 16, Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 174 Section 17 (3), Criminal Tribes Act, 1911. 566 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
