D the accused was last seen in the company of the deceased and the deceased was found dead shortly thereafter, the prosecution relies on the evidence of complainant TS (PW-3) and JS (PW-9). It appears to be improbable that, when appellant MK had herself threatened the deceased that he would no longer be alive, a real brother (PW-3) would permit the deceased to accompany her and E another accused and, that too, when the accused was carrying a gun with her. Though PW-9 has stated that on 03.09.1998, accused MK had exhorted co-accused PS that RS was alone and he should be done away with, when the death of the deceased had occurred on the very next day, he did not find it necessary to inform anyone F about it, including the police, till he was summoned to the Police Station on 10.09.1998. [Paras 14, 16 and 19][1044-G-H; 1045-G-H; 1046-D-E] 1.3 Though the dead body of the deceased was found on 4th September 1998, the statement of MS (PW-2) to whom the G alleged extra-judicial confession was made, was recorded on 9th September 1998. SI AS (PW-11) has admitted in his examination that MS (PW-2) was known to him. He has further stated that he did not know in how many cases of his Police Station MS was cited as witness. It is further to be noted that the statement of JS (PW-9) was recorded on 10th September 1998. As (PW-11) has H PRITINDER SINGH @ LOVELY v. THE STATE OF PUNJAB 1035 also admitted in his evidence that though the father of RS was A alive in those days, he did not record his statement by visiting his village. PW-11 further admitted that he also did not visit the house of the deceased RS to collect any evidence of motive or him leaving his house before the occurrence. The conviction on the basis of such evidence cannot be sustained. Apart from that, B it is to be noted that even according to PW-11, the gun which was recovered from the car had two empty cartridges (Ex. P10 and P11). Furthermore, the evidence of Dr. RKG (PW-5), who had conducted the post-mortem of the deceased, would show that there was no external exit wound, and wad and pellets were preserved and sealed. Apart from not collecting any evidence as C to whether the said gun belonged to the appellant MK, even the Ballistic Expert has not been examined to show that the wad and pellets were fired from the empty cartridges (Ex. P10 and P11). [Paras 20, 21 and 22][1046-E-H; 1047-A-C] 1.4 The present case is a case based on circumstantial D evidence. In view of the serious doubt with regard to the credibility of the witnesses on the issue of extra-judicial confession and last seen theory, the failure to examine Ballistic Expert would be a glaring defect in the prosecution case. The prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt and, as such, E the accused are entitled to benefit of doubt.
