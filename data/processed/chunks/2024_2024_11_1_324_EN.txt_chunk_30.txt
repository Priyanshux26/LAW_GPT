7. Having heard the counsel at length, we are of the opinion that the views expressed in Sanjeev Coke case [(1983) 1 SCC 147 : (1983) 1 SCR 1000] require reconsideration. Keeping in view the importance of the point in issue, namely, the interpretation of Article 39(b) it will be appropriate if these cases are heard by a larger Bench of not less than seven Judges.” (emphasis supplied) 24. Finally, the batch of cases was placed before a Bench of seven judges of this Court. The learned Solicitor General (at the time) brought the attention of the bench to an observation in the majority opinion in Mafatlal Industries Ltd vs. Union of India,25a decision by a bench of nine judges of this Court. In the majority opinion in Mafatlal, Justice Jeevan Reddy (speaking for himself and four other judges) observed: “[t]that ‘the material resources of the community are not confined to public resources but include all resources, natural and man-made, public, and private owned’ is repeatedly affirmed by this Court” and referred inter alia to the decisions of this Court in Ranganath Reddy and Sanjeev Coke to advance this proposition. 25 [1996] Supp. 10 SCR 585 : (1997) 5 SCC 536 : 1996 INSC 1514 42 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 25. In its dated 19 February 2002,26 the Bench of seven judges took the view that the interpretation of Article 39(b) requires reconsideration by a larger bench of nine judges. The bench expressed “some difficulty in sharing the broad view” that material resources owned by the community, the phrase employed by Article 39(b), includes privately owned resources. It was directed that the case be listed before a bench of nine judges after the hearing in IR Coelho vs. State of Tamil Nadu27 is concluded, as there appeared to be similar issues raised. The reference was made in the following terms: “5. Having given due consideration, we are of the opinion that this interpretation of Article 39(b) requires to be reconsidered by a Bench of nine learned Judges: we have some difficulty in sharing the broad view that material resources of the community under Article 39(b) covers what is privately owned. 6. Given that there is some similarity in the issues here involved and in I.R. Coelho v. State of T.N. [(1999) 7 SCC 580. Ed. : The nine-judge Bench decision therein is reported as I.R. Coelho v. State of T.N., (2007) 2 SCC 1.] which already stands referred to a larger Bench, preferably of nine learned Judges, we are of the view that these matters should be heard by a Bench of nine learned Judges immediately following the hearing in I.R. Coelho” (emphasis supplied) 26. The above seven-Judge Bench has resulted in the present reference before this bench of nine judges. iii. Scope of the present reference 27. During the course of the hearing, the learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the respondents,submitted that the reference made in the seven-judge bench only pertains to the interpretation of Article 39(b) and not the survival of Article 31-C.
