Consequently, the complaint, the chargesheet as well as the dated 28.03.2018 were set aside by the High Court vide the dated 25.11.2020. 9.

After condoning the delay, notice was issued.Thereafter, respondent No.2 filed counter affidavit. On perusal of the counter affidavit of the second respondent this 434 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports court in the proceedings held on 21.11.2023 noted that Annexure R-1 annexed to the said affidavit was a file noting recording the opinion of some officers that it was not a fit case to accord sanction under Section 197 Cr.PC to prosecute the second respondent. However, this Court noticed that there was no decision of the competent authority granting sanction. In such an eventuality, this Court directed the State to file an affidavit dealing with the aspect of sanction and to produce the relevant document. 11. Pursuant thereto respondent No. 1 i.e State of Karnataka has filed an affidavit. The affidavit says that the investigating officer had written to the Deputy Commissioner, Hassan, on 22.01.2018 seeking sanction to prosecute the village accountant Mallikarjun (Responsible No. 2). It is further seen that the Additional Deputy Commissioner, Hassan had informed the investigating officer vide letter dated 17.03.2018 that upon examination of the concerned file and considering the opinion of the legal advisor, sanction for prosecution of respondent No. 2 was not granted. 12. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the High Court was not justified in quashing the complaint as well as the chargesheet and the related cognizance . He submits that no sanction to prosecute was required qua respondent No. 2 as making of a fake document cannot be said to be carried out by respondent No. 2 in the discharge of his official duty. In support of his contention, he has placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Shambhoo Nath Misra Vs State of U.P., (1997) 5 SCC 326. 13. Learned State counsel supports the contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant. 14. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No. 2 supports the of the High Court and submits that the High Court had rightly quashed the complaint and the chargesheet. Without sanction to prosecute a public servant the latter cannot be prosecuted. This is a well-settled proposition and in this connection has placed reliance on a decision of this Court in D. Devaraja Vs. Obais Sanders Hussain, (2020) 7 SCC 695. 15. Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties have received the due consideration of this court. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 435 Shadakshari v. State of Karnataka & Anr. 16.

The competent authority has declined to grant sanction to prosecute.
