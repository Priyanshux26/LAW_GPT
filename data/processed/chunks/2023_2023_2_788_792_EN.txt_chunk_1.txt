However, thereafter relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. Vs. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki and Ors. reported in (2014) 3 SCC 183 and on the ground that the compensation has not been paid, the High Court has allowed the writ petition and has declared that the acquisition proceedings F with respect to the subject land are deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013. However, as the land in question was already put to use by the beneficiary Department, the High Court has directed that the original writ petitioner shall be entitled to the compensation under the New Act. G 2.1 Thus, even the High Court has accepted that the possession of the land in question was already taken over and even the land was put to use by the Department. Even the original writ petitioner also admitted the same and therefore prayed that he be paid the compensation under the Act, 2013. Once the possession of the subject land was taken over and in fact was put to use prior to 2013 Act came into force, as per the H 790 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A law laid down by this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and Ors. (2020) 8 SCC 129, there shall not be any deemed lapse of acquisition. In paragraph366 it is observed and held as under:- “366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the B questions as under: 366.1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on 1-1-2014, the date of commencement of the 2013 Act, there is no lapse of proceedings. Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of the 2013 Act. C 366.2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding the period covered by an interim of the court, then proceedings shall continue as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the 2013 Act under the 1894 Act as if it has not been repealed. D 366.3. The word “or” used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be read as “nor” or as “and”. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act takes place where due to inaction of authorities for five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the possession of land has not been taken nor compensation has been E paid. In other words, in case possession has been taken, compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse. Similarly, if compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no lapse. 366.4. The expression “paid” in the main part of Section 24(2) F of the 2013 Act does not include a deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is provided in the proviso to Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to majority of landholdings then all beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the G 1894 Act shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of the 2013 Act.
