[Paras 10, 11 and 14] Registration Act, 1908 – ss.17, 49 – Nature and character of possession – “collateral purpose” – Plea of the appellant relying upon Sevoke Properties Ltd. v. West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (2020) 11 SCC 782 that for establishing nature and purpose of possession, even an unregistered document could be looked into as that would come within the ambit of collateral purpose: Held: Sevoke Properties is not an authority for the proposition that nature and character of the possession in an unregistered lease deed could always constitute collateral purpose so that the Court could examine the deed for that reason – The purpose for which lease is granted forms an integral part of the lease deed in this case and this very issue forms one of the main disputes – The expression “collateral purpose” has been employed in proviso to s.49 to imply that content of such a document can be used for purpose other than for which it has been executed or entered into by the parties or for a purpose remote to the main transaction – Nature and character of possession contained in a fl awed document (being unregistered) in terms s.107, 1882 Act and ss.17 and 49, Registration Act can form collateral purpose when the “nature and character of possession” is not the main term of the lease and does not constitute the main dispute for adjudication by the Court – Transfer of Property Act, 1882 – s.107.
