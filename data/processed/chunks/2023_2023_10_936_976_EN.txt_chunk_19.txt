They are continuously recorded as Bhumidhar of the land in D question. The Chief Revenue Commissioner also held in his that from the dated 20.9.1999 of Additional District Magistrate (Land Acquisition) Lucknow and from the G.O.No. 376 dated 16.5.2002 issued by the Secretary, Uttaranchal Government all land acquisition E proceedings in respect of the land in question have come to an end and the Government has ed that the land be kept in the ownership and possession of the Bhumidhars i.e . Sri Ravi Kumar and Virendra Kumar.” (Emphasis Applied) F On the contrary, in the impugned judgement 05.11.2004 which arose from the 1983 Injunction Suit, the High Court noted – “In view of the amended section 131 of U.P.Z.A. & LR. Act, a lease holder would become a Sirdar on the date of enforcement of the Act viz. 1. 7.1969. The plaintiffs’ G predecessor Sri Manohar Lal got transferred the lease existing in the name of Mr. John Vaughan with the permission of the Commissioner Kumaon and he was in possession in July 1969 on the land in suit. Thus from the evidence on record it is established that the plaintiffs are the Bhumidhar, and are in possession over the land in H STATE OF UTTARAKHAND AND ANR. v. RAVI KUMAR 965 (DECEASED) THROUGH LRS AND OTHERS [SURYA KANT, J.] dispute and there is no material error in the finding arrived A at by both the courts below.” (Emphasis Applied) 37.Therefore, the High Court while deciding the issue of ownership in favour of Respondents on the strength of the Sale Deed, have come B to different conclusions as such to the nature of the instrument. In this respect, our attention is also drawn towards the contrary stands taken by the Respondents in their pleadings which have been brought on record. In the plaint filed by them in 1983 Injunction Suit, the Respondents claim to tenure holders who were later accorded the status of ‘Bhumidhar’ on the basis of Zamindari Notification. On the other hand, in the Second C Writ Petition, Respondents stated that the Sale Deed was actually in respect of the title per se. 38.Nevertheless, even if the clarification on behalf of Respondents which is taken for the first time at this stage is allowed, we must note that the tenor of the Sale Deed completely contradicts the said modified D stance. The relevant portion of the Sale Deed is as follows – “…….NOW THIS DEED WITNESSETH That in consideration of the sum of Rupees Fifty Five Thousand Rs.55000/- paid by the vendee to the vendor in the manner following i.e., Rs.5000/- five thousand acknowledged and E Rs.20000/- Twenty Thousand paid in cash before the Sub.
