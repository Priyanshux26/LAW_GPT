At that time, full conformity was not there between the First Schedule and the HSN and that was, perhaps, the reason why what was clarified in the General Notes in Chapter 33 of the HSN was directly incorporated in Chapter Note 2 in Chapter 33. Notably, in B.P.L. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. Collector of Central Excise, Vadodara,5 this Court held that for a product to be classified as a cosmetic under Chapter 33 in Section VI of the First Schedule, it must first be a cosmetic, i.e., it should be suitable for use as ‘goods falling under Headings 3303 to 3308’ and it must be put in packing with a label or literature or other indication, showing that it is intended for use as a cosmetic preparation. This decision was rendered in the year 1995 and was 5 [1995] 3 SCR 1235 : (1995) Supp. 3 SCC 1 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 913 Commissioner of Central Excise, Salem v. M/s Madhan Agro Industries (India) Private Ltd. in keeping with the then Chapter Note 2 in Chapter 33 of the First Schedule. 27. As already noted hereinbefore, Act 5 of 2005 was aimed at bringing about full conformity between the First Schedule to the Act of 1985 and the HSN and amendments were made accordingly in the First Schedule. Post the 2005 amendment, Chapter Note 3 in Chapter 33 in Section VI of the First Schedule was made a verbatim reproduction of the corresponding Chapter Note 3 in Chapter 33 in the HSN. However, as it is an admitted position that the Explanatory Notes in the HSN would also be binding once the entry in the HSN corresponds with the description of the goods in the First Schedule to the Act of 1985, the General Notes in Chapter 33 in the HSN would apply. In consequence, what was set out earlier in Chapter Note 2 in Chapter 33 of the First Schedule is now brought in by way of the General Notes in Chapter 33 of the HSN and the removal thereof from the Chapter Note in Chapter 33 of the First Schedule has no significance, except for the fact that it brought about complete parity between the First Schedule to the Act of 1985 and the HSN. 28. Therefore, it would not be sufficient to merely show that the products in question are suitable for use as goods falling under Headings 3303 to 3307 in Chapter 33 of the First Schedule and were put up in packings of a kind sold by retail for such use, but it must also be demonstrated that such products, which are suitable for other uses in addition to those described and classified in Headings 3303 to 3307, are in packings of a kind sold to consumers and are put up with labels, literature or other indications that they are for use as perfumery, cosmetic or toilet preparations or they are put up in a form clearly specialized to such use, for example - acetone put up in small bottles along with a brush for applying it, thereby indicating its use as nail polish remover.
