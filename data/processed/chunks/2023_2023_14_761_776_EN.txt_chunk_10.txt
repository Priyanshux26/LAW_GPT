Such a situation can only be contemplated when the implied term can be considered necessary to lend effi cacy to the terms of the contract. If the contract is capable of interpretation of its plain meaning with regard to the true intention of the parties it will not be prudent to read implied terms on the understanding of a party, or by the court, with regard to business effi cacy.” 36. In the present context, bearing in mind the background of the establishment of the fi rst respondent, and the shortfall of domestic gas for reasons beyond the control of the fi rst respondent, such a deviation from the plain terms is not merited and militates against business effi cacy as it has a detrimental impact on the viability of the fi rst respondent. 37. The execution proceedings pursuant to the above-mentioned execution petition before the APTEL be continued. 38. The appeal is dismissed. There shall be no as to costs. 39. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal dismissed. Nidhi Jain 14 (2018) 3 SCC 716, 729 para 26.
