[2023] 14 S.C.R. 683 : 2023 INSC 931 CASE DETAILS M/S UNIBROS v. ALL INDIA RADIO (Civil Appeal No. 6895/2023) OCTOBER 19, 2023 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT AND DIPANKAR DATTA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Arbitral award in question if in confl ict with the public policy of India and; whether a claim on account of loss of profi t is liable to succeed merely on the ground that there has been delay in the execution of the construction contract, attributable to the employer. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.34(2)(b) – “Public policy of India” – Appellant awarded work contract by the respondent – Disputes between the parties owing to the delay in work, referred to Arbitrator – Vide First Award, appellant was awarded sum towards loss of profi t (Claim No.12) – Award set aside by High Court, claims remitted to the Arbitrator – Second Award was passed maintaining the award for loss of profi t and interest to the appellant vide First Award – Respondent fi led petition u/s.34 for setting aside the second Award – Single Judge allowed the objection, rejected the appellant's claim inter alia holding that there was no suffi cient evidence presented by the appellant to establish the claimed loss of profi t – affi rmed by Division Bench: Held: Second Award is equally in confl ict with the public policy of India as the First Award – While remitting Claim No.12 for reconsideration, the Arbitrator was warned not to be infl uenced by the factors that weighed in his mind while making the First Award – Arbitrator was also required to proceed only on the basis of the evidence – However, the Arbitrator went on to ignore the judicial decision of the High Court with impunity – The factors which weighed in the Arbitrator’s mind in the fi rst round and the second round are one and the same – To avoid any charge of being branded 683 684 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. as a mirror image of the First Award insofar as Claim No.12 is concerned, the Second Award appears to have been expressed in language and form diff erent from the earlier one without, however, there being any change in substance – A judicial decision of a superior court, which is binding on an inferior court, has to be accepted with grace by the inferior court notwithstanding that the decision of the superior court may not be palatable to the inferior court – This principle, ex proprio vigore, would be applicable to an arbitrator and a multi-member arbitral tribunal as well, particularly when it is faced with a judicial decision (either u/s.34 or s.37 of the Act) ing a limited remand – In the wake of authority of judicial determination made by the Courts of law, any award of an arbitrator or a tribunal that seeks to overreach a binding judicial decision does confl ict with the fundamental public policy and thus, cannot be sustained – Further, a claim for damages, whether general or special, cannot as a matter of course result in an award without proof of the claimant having suff ered injury – Arbitral award in question is patently illegal in that it is based on no evidence and is, thus, outrightly perverse; therefore, again, it is in confl ict with the “public policy of India” as contemplated by s.34(2)(b) – No merit in the appeal.
