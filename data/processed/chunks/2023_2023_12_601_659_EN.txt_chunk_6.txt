Thereafter, acting upon the abovementioned GPA, M.A. Baksh sold a part of the Subject Land to private individuals between the period of January 1992 to October 1992 as brought to our notice by the parties through sale deeds placed on record. On perusal of these sale deeds, one crucial feature which is to be noted is that M.A. Baksh envisaged to divide the Subject Land into smaller plots akin to a residential colony as each sale deed has been allotted a unique plot number along with roads earmarked in the site plans attached thereto. 10. It seems that at the time M.A. Baksh was carrying out the process of the sale of the Subject Land as a residential colony, he came across the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers) Act of 1977 [Hereinafter, ‘1977 Act’] which prohibited transfer of land assigned to landless poor by the Government. Realizing the potential pitfall in carrying out the sales, he applied for clarifi cation through a letter dated 18.09.1992 to the concerned Mandal Revenue Offi cer and enquired about the applicability of the 1977 Act. The Mandal Revenue Offi cer vide a memo dated 23.09.1992, responded to M.A. Baksh’s query saying that:– “The petitioner Sri M.A. Baksh, G.P.A. Holder of Mr. Mylaram Jangaiah and others is informed that as per written permission issued by the Tahsildar, Hyderabad West vide reference No.A6/8524/80 to occupy an extent of 143-00 acres out of Sy.

Subsequently in 1965 the said land was made Laouni patta.in the name of the above 20 persons, and subdivided as Sy. No. 393/1 to 393/20 Ac.7-06gts., each individual. As per rule 9(g) of the Laouni rules 1950 the written permission in form (G) is issued only after confi rmation of sale; The sale of such lands is not hit by the provision of A.P. Assignment lands (Prohibition of Transfer) Act 1977.” (sic) (Emphasis Applied) 11.
