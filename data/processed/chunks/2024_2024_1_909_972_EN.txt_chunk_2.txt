Digital Supreme Court Reports by the bidders are not aligned to the prevailing market prices – It does not stipulate rejection of all the bids in the bidding process – If the contention that clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines will come into play, which permits the Evaluation Committee to reject “all” price bids and not “any” one of them is accepted, it will lead to absurdity – The Court, while interpreting a particular provision, will have to apply the principles of purposive construction – Such an interpretation would result in defeating one of the main objects of the enactment, i.e., protection of the consumer. [Paras 84, 87, 88 and 91] Interpretation of Statutes – Principle of purposive construction – Discussed. Electricity Act, 2003 – ss.62, 63, 79(1)(b): Held: The non-obstante clause advisedly restricts itself to s.62, there is no reason to put s.79 out of the way altogether – Either u/s.62, or 63, the general regulatory power of the Commission u/s.79(1)(b) is the source of the power to regulate, which includes the power to determine or adopt tariff – ss.62 and 63 deal with “determination” of tariff, which is part of “regulating” tariff – In a situation where the guidelines issued by the Central Government u/s.63 cover the situation, the Central Commission is bound by those guidelines and must exercise its regulatory functions, albeit u/s.79(1)(b), only in accordance with those guidelines. [Para 68] Alternate remedy – Electricity Act, 2003 – Constitution of India – Article 226 – Judicial review – Scope: Held: The Electricity Act is an exhaustive code on all matters concerning electricity – Under the Electricity Act, all issues dealing with electricity have to be considered by the authorities constituted under the said Act – The State Electricity Commission and the APTEL have ample powers to adjudicate in the matters with regard to electricity – These Tribunals are tribunals consisting of experts having vast experience in the field of electricity – In the present case, the High Court erred in directly entertaining the writ petition when the respondent No.1-the writ petitioner before the High Court had an adequate alternate remedy of approaching the State Electricity Commission – Although, availability of an alternate remedy is not a complete bar in the exercise of the power of judicial review by the High Courts but, recourse to such a remedy would be permissible only if extraordinary and exceptional circumstances are made out – While exercising its power of judicial review, the [2024] 1 S.C.R. 913 Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v. MB Power (Madhya Pradesh) Limited & Ors. Court can step in where a case of manifest unreasonableness or arbitrariness is made out – There was not even an allegation with regard to that effect – In such circumstances, recourse to a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in the availability of efficacious alternate remedy under a statute which is a complete code in itself was not justified. [Paras 93-95] Contract – Award of contract, a commercial transaction – Judicial Scrutiny – Scope: Held: The award of a contract, whether by a private party or by a public body or the State is essentially a commercial transaction – In arriving at a commercial decision, considerations which are paramount are commercial considerations – State can choose its own method to arrive at a decision – It can fix its own terms of invitation to tender and that is not open to judicial scrutiny – State can enter into negotiations before finally deciding to accept one of the offers made to it – Price need not always be the sole criterion for awarding a contract – State may not accept the offer even though it happens to be the highest or the lowest – However, the State, its corporations, instrumentalities and agencies are bound to adhere to the norms, standards and procedures laid down by them and cannot depart from them arbitrarily – Though that decision is not amenable to judicial review, the court can examine the decision-making process and interfere if it is found vitiated by mala fides, unreasonableness and arbitrariness – Only when the Court comes to a conclusion that overwhelming public interest requires interference, the court should intervene.
