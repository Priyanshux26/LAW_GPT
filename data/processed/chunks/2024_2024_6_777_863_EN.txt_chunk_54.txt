It was borne out during the course of arguments and through the submissions made in the Counter Affidavit that the tax audit monitoring mechanism was firstly, self-regulatory, wherein the disciplinary mechanism would kick in only on a complaint made/information received and not otherwise. Furthermore, the Tax Audit Monitoring Cell was created only after the CAG Report No. 32/2014, and even after that, initially notices were sent only selectively to Chartered Accountants who had completed more than two hundred audits not to all who had breached the impugned Guideline. 43. As a rule of statutory interpretation, we find that the aforesaid principles, in an equitable legal system, should be applicable to the present circumstances. Thereby, for the limited period of uncertainty, the rule against doubtful penalization as a principle could, in the interest of justice and equity, be made applicable and the benefit of uncertainty be given to those subjected to misconduct proceedings in the instant writ petitions and to also those Chartered Accountants who may have received notices from the respondent-Institute and who may not have approached any court of law or to other similarly situated Chartered Accountants who may not have been proceeded against. 44. Reference may also be made to of this Court in Jindal Paper & Plastics vs. Union of India, (1997) 10 SCC 536, (“Jindal Paper & Plastics”) wherein the question on merits was settled by a of this Court in Kasinka Trading vs. Union of India, (1995) 1 SCC 274, (“Kasinka Trading”), delivered on 18.10.1994 and a larger bench on 20.12.1996 concluded that the dated 18.10.1994 was good law. This Court allowed the petitioner’s prayer therein that for the period of uncertainty in law, i.e., until the law, on merits, was settled by this Court on 18.10.1994, a lesser interest rate of 12% be charged instead of 17.5%, as ed by the High Court. In these circumstances, this Court held as follows: “4. We are of the view that there was uncertainty about the law until the decision in the case of Kasinka [2024] 6 S.C.R. 859 Shaji Poulose v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India & Others Trading [(1995) 1 SCC 274 : JT (1994) 7 SC 362] was rendered on 18-10-1994, and that, therefore, interest from the date it became payable until 18-10-1994, should be payable at the rate of 12% per annum. Interest for the further period should be at the rate of 17.5% per annum, as ed by the High Court. Calculations shall be made accordingly and the balance and interest as aforesaid due by the appellants shall be paid to the respondents within 8 weeks.” (emphasis supplied) 45. We, therefore, find much force in the alternative plea made by the petitioners herein. In these circumstances, due to the uncertainty in law owing to quashing of the earlier Guideline and the pendency of the Special Leave Petition filed by the respondent-Institute before this Court and the enforcement of a fresh Guideline, we quash the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the petitioners herein.
