PC”, hereafter) are A unwittingly being transformed into processes for recovery of the quantum of money allegedly cheated and the courts driven to impose conditions for deposit/payment as pre-requisite for grant of pre-arrest bail. The present case is no different from the others and it is considered appropriate to remind the high courts and the sessions courts not to be unduly swayed B by submissions advanced by counsel on behalf of the accused in the nature of undertakings to keep in deposit/repay any amount while seeking bail under section 438 of the Cr. PC. and incorporating a condition in that behalf for deposit/payment as a pre-requisite for grant of bail. 3. The bare facts relevant for a decision on this appeal, gathered C from the impugned of the Delhi High Court, are these. The appellant before us is the owner of an immovable property. With an intention to re-develop the same, he had entered into three agreements with one Ashwani Kumar (“the builder”, hereafter) dated 10th and 19th December, 2018 and 30th January, 2019. In terms of the agreement dated 19th December, 2018, the builder was required to construct a multi-storied D building in which the appellant would have ownership rights in respect of the 3rd floor and the upper floor, apart from Rs.55,00,000/- (Rupees fifty- five lakh) to be paid to him by the builder, whereas the builder would have rights to deal with the 1st and the 2nd floors together with other rights as described therein. In pursuance of the aforesaid agreement, E the builder entered into an agreement to sell and purchase/bayana dated 14th December, 2018 with Vinay Kumar and Sandeep Kumar (“the complainants”, hereafter) in respect of the 2nd floor of the proposed building (without roof rights) but other rights as described therein for a sum of Rs. 60,00,000/- (Rupees sixty lakh). The complainants had allegedly paid to the builder Rs. 11,00,000/- (Rupees eleven lakh) [Rs. F 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh) as token money and Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees ten lakh) as earnest money], at the time of execution of the agreement dated 14th December, 2018. Thereafter, on the instructions of the builder, the complainants on different dates allegedly made payments of additional amounts to the appellant as well as the builder, in cash as well as by G cheques, totaling to Rs. 35,00,000/- (Rupees thirty-five lakh). 4. Allegedly, the complainants failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement dated 14th December, 2018 triggering institution of a civil suit by the builder against the complainants seeking cancellation of such agreement and forfeiture of the amount of Rs. H 1170 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A 13,00,000/- (Rupees thirteen lakh). This was purportedly upon invocation of clause 8 of the said agreement. It is also a matter of record that the builder has instituted another civil suit inter alia against the appellant for specific performance of the agreements dated 10th and 19th December, 2018. However, from the materials on record, we have failed to ascertain the dates of institution of the civil suits.
