The second of such s is passed on 4th August 20063. The D said basically pertains to banning the mining activities in the National Parks, Sanctuaries and forest areas. The Court laid down various pre- conditions wherein temporary working permits could be granted. 19. The next is passed on 4th December 20064. In the said , the Court expressed its anguish towards the various State E Governments for not responding to the letter issued by MoEF dated 27th May 2005 requiring them to initiate measures for identification of suitable areas and submit detailed proposals at the earliest. It will be relevant to refer to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the said , which read thus: “3. The earlier passed on 30-1-2006 [Goa F Foundation v. Union of India, (2011) 15 SCC 793] refers to the decision which was taken on 21-1-2002 to notify the areas within 10 km of the boundaries of national parks and sanctuaries as eco- sensitive areas. The Letter dated 27-5-2005 is a departure from the decision of 21-1-2002. For the present, in this case, we are G not considering the correctness of this departure. That is being examined in another case separately. Be that as it may, it is evident that the States/Union Territories have not given the importance 3 (2010) 13 SCC 740 4 (2011) 15 SCC 791 H 614 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A that is required to be given to most of the laws to protect environment made after Rio Declaration, 1992. 4. The Ministry is directed to give a final opportunity to all States/ Union Territories to respond to its Letter dated 27-5-2005. The State of Goa also is permitted to give appropriate proposal in B addition to what is said to have already been sent to the Central Government. The communication sent to the States/Union Territories shall make it clear that if the proposals are not sent even now within a period of four weeks of receipt of the communication from the Ministry, this Court may have to consider passing s for implementation of the decision that was taken C on 21-1-2002, namely, notification of the areas within 10 km of the boundaries of the sanctuaries and national parks as eco- sensitive areas with a view to conserve the forest, wildlife and environment, and having regard to the precautionary principles. If the States/Union Territories now fail to respond, they would do so D at their own risk and peril.” 20. It can be seen that this Court refers to its earlier dated 30th January 2006 wherein a reference is made to the decision dated 21st January 2002 to notify the areas within 10 kilometres of the boundaries of National Parks and Sanctuaries as ESZs. Though the records E that the letter dated 27th May 2005 is a departure from the decision taken on 21st January 2002, the Court observes that, in the said case, the Court was not considering the correctness of the said departure. The Court therefore directed the Ministry to give a final opportunity to all States/Union Territories to respond to its Letter dated 27th May 2005.
