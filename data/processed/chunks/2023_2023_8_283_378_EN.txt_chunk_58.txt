Without giving the sub-division numbers of Survey No.172 and without describing different parcels of land as per the allotment allegedly made by the Advocate Commissioner, the Memorandum of gift proceeds to mention mere boundaries. F Interestingly, Northern boundary is stated to be Nizampet village, Southern boundary is stated to be Bombay Highway and Western boundary is stated to be Survey No.28 belonging to Jeelani Begum. Therefore, the entire claim made by persons claiming under defendant No.52, appears to be a hoax. G 200. In fact, Shri V.V.S. Rao, learned senior counsel attempted to trace the title of the appellants, to the report of the Nazim Atiyat Court and the Muntakhab issued by the Commissioner of Survey, Settlements and Land Records. But as we have already pointed out, the suit was not one for title. H 368 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 201. Interestingly, the appellants in these appeals represented by Shri V.V.S. Rao, learned senior counsel, also attack the claim made by Goldstone/Trinity, on the ground that the sale deed dated 23.02.1967 executed by Nizam through his Constituted Attorney C.B. Taraporwala in favour of F.E. Dinshaw Company is not valid. The contention in this regard is that though the Nizam executed a power of attorney on B 17.11.1962, he became seriously ill and his condition deteriorated on 22.02.1967 and that he was put on oxygen. The sale deed by his power agent was prepared on 23.02.1967. The Nizam passed away on 24.02.1967. But the sale deed was presented for registration by Taraporwala on 17.03.1967. Therefore, according to the appellants, the C sale made by the Agent after the termination of his agency under Section 201 of the Indian Contract Act is wholly invalid. 202. If what the appellants say is true, no marketable title could have passed on from Nizam to Cyrus to Goldstone. Therefore, it is not merely those claiming under defendant No.52 but also Cyrus/Goldstone/ D Trinity, should sink together. 203. Appearing along with Shri V.V.S. Rao, learned senior counsel, for some of the appellants, it was contended by Shri K.S. Murthy, learned senior counsel that Hydernagar village came to be declared as a grant village and that it was covered by Altamagha which is a Royal decree. E The learned senior counsel also drew our attention to the Inam enquiry and the of the Revenue Board and the Muntakhab. 204. But as we have stated earlier, what was in hand was a suit for partition and all parties have not only created confusion but also started fishing in troubled waters. F 205. Shri V.V.S. Rao, learned senior counsel also appears for another set of appellants, namely Fareeduddin Khan and two others, who have come up with a challenge to the impugned . These appellants claim title to the land of the extent of acres 30.00 in Survey No.145/2, acres 62.00 in Survey No.145/1 and acres 30.00 in Survey No.163/3 of Hydernagar village. There are three appellants in these G four appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos.8888-8891 of 2022.
