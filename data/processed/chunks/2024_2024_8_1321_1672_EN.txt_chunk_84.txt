In other words, while the State may embark on an exercise of sub-classification, it must do so on the basis of quantifiable and demonstrable data bearing on levels of backwardness and representation in the services of the State. It cannot in other words merely act on its whims or as a matter of political expediency. The decision of the State is amenable to judicial review. When its action is challenged under Article 226 or before this Court under Article 32, the State must provide justification and 1434 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the rationale for its determination. No State action can be manifestly arbitrary. It must be based on intelligible differentia which underlie the sub-classification. The basis of the sub-classification must bear a reasonable nexus to the object sought to be achieved. b. The caste-class conundrum 191. One of the issues that arises is whether the State may provide special provisions for each caste within the class. In Indra Sawhney (supra), the State classified the Other backward Castes into two categories – the backward class and the more backward class. Thus, the class was only sub-divided into two categories. Is it permissible to classify the Scheduled Castes by providing preference or reservation in a percentage of seats to every caste? 192. Both Articles 15(4) and 16(4) do not enable reservation based on castes but only on classes. The absence of the use of “caste” in Articles 15(4) and 16(4) when coupled with its use in Articles 15(2) and 16(2) led the courts to hold that caste cannot be the sole basis of reservation.238 However, as Marc Galanter notes, the court had erroneously fused the two distinct usages of caste, as a unit or class, and as a criterion of backwardness.239 193. In Balaji (supra), the criterion for the determination of social and educational backwardness was in question. This Court held that caste is a relevant consideration for determining social backwardness. However, the Court observed that caste cannot be the sole basis for determining the beneficiary class because it would perpetuate the vice of castes. Disagreeing with the Nagan Gowda report, Justice Gajendragadkar writing for the Bench, held that economic backwardness and not caste is the ultimate cause of social backwardness. This interpretation of the permissibility of caste as a criterion to determine the backward class was approved in Chitralekha v. State of Mysore.240 In P Rajendran v. State of Madras,241 this Court deviated from the approach adopted in 238 Venkataramana v. State of Madras, AIR 1951 SC 226; Balaji v. State of Mysore, AIR 1963 SC 649 239 Galanter, supra, Pg. 189 240 AIR 1964 SC 1823 241 [1968] 2 SCR 786 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1435 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. Chitralekha (supra) and MR Balaji (supra) observing that caste is a class because it is a homogenous “unit”.242 The approach in P Rajendran (supra) was later approved by a nine-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney (supra), where this Court observed that to determine a socially backward class, a caste can be identified as a unit since it is homogenous and then the criteria for backwardness can be applied to it.243 194.
