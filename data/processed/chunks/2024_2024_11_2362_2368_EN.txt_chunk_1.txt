Case Arising From CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 12326 of 2024 From the and dated 29.02.2024 of the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur in WA No. 109 of 2024 Appearances for Parties Manish Kumar Gupta, Lave Kumar Sharma, Sharadprakash Pandey, Advs. for the Appellant. Vikrant Singh Bais, D.A.G., Vinayak Sharma, Ravinder Kumar Yadav, Kshitiz Aggarwal, Kritika Yadav, Advs. for the Respondents. / of the Supreme Court Leave granted. 2. The appellant in this case is a 27-year-old woman, with a seemingly strong commitment towards improving democracy at the grassroots level. Motivated by this vision, she contested the elections in 2020 for the position of Sarpanch of the Sajbahar Gram Panchayat in District Jashpur, Chhattisgarh, the village that she belongs to. She was subsequently declared elected with a substantial margin. 3. Having assumed the office of Sarpanch, the appellant undertook several measures towards development of the village, with the objective of bettering the quality of lives of its inhabitants. Pursuantly, after significant effort by the appellant, the Zila Panchayat, Jashpur sanctioned 10 construction projects for the Sajbahar village under the aegis of the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Industrial Park Scheme (RIPA). These construction works involved the development of industrial infrastructure, along with amenities such as roads and schools, which would not only improve the well-being of the villagers but also aid in making the village economically self-sufficient. However, the Chief Executive Officer of the Janpad Panchayat, despite lacking [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2365 Sonam Lakra v. State of Chhattisgarh & Ors. technical expertise regarding the time required for such projects, issued a Work on 16.12.2022, mandating completion of the development works within the limited duration of three months. This for reasons best known to the Chief Executive Officer was belatedly served to the Gram Panchayat on 21.03.2023, which ironically marked the end of the stipulated three-month period since the date of issuance of the work . 4. Subsequently, the delay in execution was unjustly attributed to the appellant, resulting in a Show-Cause Notice issued on 26.05.2023, followed by a chargesheet. In her response, the appellant clarified that there was no delay in the construction work. Despite her explanation, bureaucratic high-handedness led to her removal from office on 18.01.2024. 5. Aggrieved, the appellant sought relief from higher authorities and the High Court but faced rejection at every turn. Undeterred, she initiated the present proceedings. On 05.04.2024, this Court stayed the s of the Sub-Divisional Officer (Revenue), Pharsabahar, and the High Court, reinstating the appellant as Sarpanch and directing that she be allowed to perform her duties without any obstruction. 6. The respondent-State of Chhattisgarh has filed a counter-affidavit, containing mechanical contentions that “sufficient opportunity was afforded to the appellant to present her case” and that an inquiry was conducted in compliance with the provisions of the Chhattisgarh Panchayat Raj Adhiniyam, 1993, and the Chhattisgarh Panchayats (Appeal and Revision) Rules, 1995.
