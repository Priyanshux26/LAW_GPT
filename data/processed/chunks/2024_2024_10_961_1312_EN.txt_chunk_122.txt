350. Against this backdrop, the Court is confronted with deciding whether Section 6A is unconstitutional for being violative of Article 355. (a) Intention behind Article 355 351. In to comprehend the reason behind the inclusion of Article 355, it is vital to understand its intended objective. Article 355 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1135 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 states that it is the duty of the Union to protect every State against ‘external aggression’ and ‘internal disturbance’ and to ensure that the Government of every State is carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution. Article 355, expounded in Part XVIII of the Indian Constitution, which pertains to ‘Emergency Provisions,’ was initially not present in the Draft Constitution of 1948. However, it was subsequently introduced in 1949 by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee in the Constituent Assembly.219 At that time, Article 355 was denoted as Article 277A and was presented for discussion in the Constituent Assembly along with draft Articles 278 and 278A, now recognized as Articles 356 and 357 of the Indian Constitution. 352. In the context of the introduction of draft Article 277A, later designated as Article 355, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar elucidated its underlying purpose. He emphasized that despite the numerous provisions conferring overriding powers on the Center, the Indian Constitution was fundamentally federal, with States having primacy in legislating over their designated domains. Accordingly, if the Centre was to interfere in the administration of provincial affairs through Article 356 and 357 (draft Articles 278 and 278A of the Indian Constitution), there ought to be some obligation which the Constitution imposes upon the Center. It was emphasized that such an ‘invasion’ by the Centre of the Provincial field “must not be an invasion which is wanton, arbitrary and unauthorized by law.” Thus, it was succinctly stated that “in to make it quite clear that Draft Arts. 278 and 278A are not deemed as a wanton invasion by the Centre upon the authority of the provision, we propose to introduce Article 277A.” 353. Similar clauses appear in the Australian and American Constitutions. Dr. Ambedkar stated that Article 355 incorporated an additional clause to the principle enunciated in these other constitutions, namely, that it shall also be the duty of the Union to protect the Constitutional mandate in the Provinces. For context, Article 355 is seen to be borrowed from Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution of the United States and Section 119 of the Australian Constitution. Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution of the United States provides as follows: "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect 219 Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume 9, 03.08.1949 and 04.08.1949. 1136 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.” 354. Similarly, Section 119 of the Australian Constitution provides as follows: "The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence.” 355.
