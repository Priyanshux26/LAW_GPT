Thus, there was no concealment. In paragraph 30 of the written statement, apart from a denial of the averments made in the paragraph of the election petition under reply, there was a statement with regard to filing of two nomination papers along with two affidavits. 74 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 24. In the application seeking leave to file replication, the election petitioner stated that the returned candidate had, in paragraphs 1 (I) to (x), 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 19, 21 and 30, stated new facts of which a reply was required, therefore leave to file a replication be granted. In the replication, in paragraph 15, the election petitioner dealt with account number 920010008072418 maintained with the Axis Bank. Paragraph 16 of the replication dealt with account number 920010008661144, whereas paragraph 17 dealt with account numbers 920010008072418, 920010008661144. Similarly in paragraph 18 account number 910010004837498 was discussed and a report in respect of demand analysis and recoverability status was provided in a tabular form. In paragraph 19 account number 915020012865061 was discussed. Likewise, in paragraph 22, account number 264301001639 of the ICICI bank was discussed. In paragraph 23 again, account number 264301001639 was discussed. In paragraph 24, the registration of the vehicle in the name of the returned candidate was reiterated, and the claim that the vehicle was gifted in the year 2012 was denied. In paragraph 25, it was stated that whether the disclosure already made in respect of profession or occupation of spouse was proper or not, is for the Court to decide. Similarly, in paragraph 26 it was stated that the returned candidate was obliged to disclose the amount invested in the construction of residential house. 25. It is clear from above that the non-disclosure of bank accounts, alleged in the election petition, was sought to be explained by the returned candidate in his written statement. The replication only sought to meet that explanation. Similarly, the reply in the written statement in respect of other material facts pleaded in the election petition was sought to be dealt with, by way of explanation, in the replication. The replication does not seek to incorporate any new material facts or a new cause of action to question the election. It only seeks to explain the averments made in the written statement. Thus, in our view, leave to file replication was justified and well within the discretionary jurisdiction of the High Court. 26. We, therefore, find no merit in this appeal. The same is dismissed. There is no as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeal dismissed.
