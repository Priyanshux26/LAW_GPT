9. We are, therefore, of the view that the reason mentioned in the impugned that the application had been filed for extension without any valid basis as the sanction had already been granted, was not correct. 10. The High Court also fell in error in not taking into consideration the reasons given under section 43D(2) (b) were clearly made out and explained in the extension letter dated 07.11.2020 giving the details of the progress of the investigation as also the reasons for detaining the respondent. The Public Prosecutor had mentioned in the request that major investigation of the case had been completed and the draft chargesheet had been prepared. However, for want of remaining sanctions and FSL report some more time was required for completing the investigation. 11. Insofar as the reasons for detention are concerned, it was mentioned that during the course of investigation one Mr. Gurtej Singh had been arrested who had links with Pakistan based terrorists and had been planning to go to Pakistan for weapons training along with his associate respondent No.2 Rajkumar alias Lovely and others. 10 (2019)5 SCC 178 80 [2024] 1 S.C.R. DIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS 12. The High Court also failed to consider that after completing the investigation, Police report under section 173(2) CrPC had already been submitted prior to 30.11.2020 which was the last date of the extended period. 13. One more aspect to be considered is the nature of offence which involved terrorist activities having not only Pan India impact but also impact on other enemy States. The matter should not have been taken so lightly. 14. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The impugned passed by the High Court is set aside. The respondent No.2 be taken into custody forthwith, if not already in custody. Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan Result of the case: Appeal allowed.
