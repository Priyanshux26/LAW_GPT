15. Insofar as the relief for recovery of the unpaid amount under the purchase s was concerned, the Tribunal opined that it was not barred by limitation because meaningful negotiations were ongoing between the parties as evidenced by the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018, which was followed by a written offer of the purchaser/ employer, dated 26 May 2018, to pay Rupees three crores to the claimant as full and final settlement of the account. The relevant observations in that regard are found in paragraph 16.03 (d) of the award, which is extracted below: “16.03 (d) Based on the arguments of the Parties’ respective Counsel and with reference to the case law and statutes cited during the oral hearing in this arbitration, the Tribunal finds that as long as meaningful negotiations were ongoing between the parties the period of limitation of three years had not begun to run. Following the meeting held between the parties on 19th April 2018 the respondents made a written offer to settle the matter on 26th May 2018. Thus, the Tribunal finds that the period of limitation had not commenced until 26th May 2018 and consequently had not expired when the Request for Arbitration was received [2024] 9 S.C.R. 515 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. by the ICC Secretariat on 2nd May 2019. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that items A, D, E and F claiming payment of money are not time barred.” 16. Regarding the counterclaim for cost of repair/ replacement of gearboxes and fan modules as barred by limitation, the Tribunal reasoned thus: “16.04 Time Bar in relation to the Respondents’ counterclaims for the cost of repair/replacement of gearboxes and fan modules. There is no evidence that these counterclaims were included in the ongoing negotiations. The Tribunal has found that the Taking Over Certificate is deemed to have been issued on 21st September 2015. (See Section 13.13 above). On that date the Claimant is deemed to have completed its obligations and thus, that is the latest date from which the limitation period of three years must run. The Claimant’s liabilities are barred by limitation on or earlier than 21st September 2018. The Counterclaim was delivered on 15th July 2019 and is, thus, barred by limitation……….” CHALLENGE TO THE AWARD U/S 34 OF THE 1996 ACT 17. Two applications, namely, O.P. Nos. 533 and 562 of 2020, were filed by OPG (the appellant in the leading Civil Appeal) and Gita Power (appellant in the connected appeal and R-2 in the leading appeal) respectively, under Section 34 of the 1996 Act, for setting aside the award dated 13 July 2020. Grounds of Challenge 18. OPG and Gita Power laid challenge to the arbitral award, inter alia, on the following grounds: (i) Enexio’s (R-1’s) claim was made beyond the period of limitation prescribed by Articles 14 and 18 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act. The arbitration clause was invoked on 2 May 2019, well beyond three years from the date (i.e., 31 March 2014) when the work ought to have been completed as per the contract.
