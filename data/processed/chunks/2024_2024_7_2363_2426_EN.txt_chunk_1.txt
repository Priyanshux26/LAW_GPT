[Para 85] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2365 Arvind Kejriwal v. Directorate of Enforcement Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.19(1) – Preconditions to arrest under – Power to arrest – Judicial review – Plea of the respondent-Directorate of Enforcement that there should not be judicial scrutiny of the power to arrest as it will interfere with the investigation: Held: Rejected – The exercise of the power to arrest is not exempt from the scrutiny of courts – A decision-making error u/s.19(1) can lead to the arrest and deprivation of liberty of the arrestee – Courts have the power of judicial review and must examine that the exercise of the power to arrest meets the statutory conditions – The legislature imposed strict conditions as preconditions to arrest and was aware that the arrest may be before or prior to initiation of the criminal proceedings/prosecution complaint and did not exclude the examination of the said preconditions being satisfied in a particular case – This flows from the mandate of s.19(3) which requires that the arrestee must be produced within 24 hours and taken to the Special Court, or court of judicial/metropolitan magistrate having jurisdiction – The power of judicial review remains both before and after the filing of criminal proceedings/ prosecution complaint.
