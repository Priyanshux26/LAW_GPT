Gupta17 (v) K.P. Mohammed Salim v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Cochin18 B (vi) Raj Kumar Shivhare v. Assistant Director, Directorate of Enforcement and another19 54. The learned A.G. submits that the action under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act cannot be construed in a narrow compass. It is submitted that various factors, aspects and challenging C confrontations affecting the economic system of the country and its stability will have to be given due weightage while considering the validity of the action taken under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act. 55. The learned A.G. submits that the comparison of the action taken under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act with the 1946 D and the 1978 legislations is totally misconceived. It is submitted that, in any case, the 2017 Act not only addresses the issues relating to cessationof legal tender under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act, but also provides for exchange of bank notes in that Article 300A of the Constitution of India is complied with, and also extinguishes the liabilities E of the Issue Department of the RBI under Section 34 of the RBI Act. 56. The learned A.G. submits that if the construction as advanced by the petitioners is accepted, then the very purpose for which the provision is made shall stand frustrated. The learned A.G., relying on the of this Court in the case of C.I.T. v. S. Teja Singh20, submits F that it is a settled principle of law that the Courts will strongly lean against a construction of a provision which will render it futile.It issubmitted that the bolder construction, based on the view that Parliament would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result, is required to be accepted. G 57. The learned A.G. submits that the argument that the word “any” would not mean “all” is fallacious in nature. If the same is accepted, 16 (1970) 2 SCC 272 17 (1994) 1 SCC 243 18 (2008) 11 SCC 573 19 (2010) 4 SCC 772 H 20 AIR 1959 SC 352 VIVEK NARAYAN SHARMA v. UNION OF INDIA 49 [B. R. GAVAI, J.] the Government would technically be permitted to issue separate A notifications for each series but would be prohibited from issuing a common notification for all series. It is submitted that if such process is held to be permitted, it would lead to chaos and uncertainty. 58. The learned A.G. further submits that the word “any” has been used at two places in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act. B It is submitted that the word “any” preceding the words “series of bank notes” has to be construed to mean “all”, whereas the word “any” preceding the word “denomination” may be construed to be singular or otherwise. He submits that the same word used in the same provision twice could be permitted to have a different meaning. He relies on the C of this Court in the case of Maharaj Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh and others21 in support of his submission.
