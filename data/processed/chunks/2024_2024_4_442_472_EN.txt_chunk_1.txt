Digital Supreme Court Reports empowered officer proceeds on his personal knowledge – While the same is to be conveyed to the immediate official superior prior to the said search or raid, in case of any inability to do so, the s.42(2) provides that a copy of the same shall be sent to the concerned immediate official superior along with grounds of his belief as per the proviso hereto – This relaxation contemplated by virtue of s.42(2) was brought about through the Amendment Act of 2001 to the NDPS Act wherein prior to this position s.42(2) mandated the copy of the said writing to be sent to the immediate official superior “forthwith”. [Para 31] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.6 – “acts forming part of same transaction” – Search conducted at the residence of the Accused No.4 if was in continuance of action of the raiding party towards the search of the auto rickshaw based on the secret information received by PW-2 (Intelligence Officer/ Inspector): Held: No – The attempt towards raiding/searching the residence of Accused No.4 was not explicitly in pursuance of detaining the said accused – Testimonies of the members of the raiding party showcase the idea of search of the house to be an afterthought with an admitted time gap of 40-45 minutes between having raided the auto rickshaw which was alleged to be abandoned by the driver and Accused No.4 and subsequent search of the house of Accused No.4, wherein Accused No.1 was present – Moreover, it appears from the record that even the idea to search the house was for the purpose of recovery of more contraband and not to apprehend the said absconded accused at the first instance – Hence, the search conducted at the residence of the Accused No.4 was not a continuance of action of the raiding party towards the search of the auto rickshaw based on the secret information received by PW-2 – Accordingly, it does not appropriately fulfill the requirements of the test laid down in Gentela Vijyvardhan Rao and Anr. v.
