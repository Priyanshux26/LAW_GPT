34 of 2019 before the High Court. They are aggrieved by dismissal of their writ petition which sought: (a) quashing of the relaxation dated 21.08.2017; and (b) a direction upon HPSSC to prepare the merit-list by including only those candidates who possess essential minimum qualifi cations as specifi ed in advertisement No. 30 of 2015 dated 13.02.2015. ANKITA THAKUR & ORS. v. THE H.P. STAFF SELECTION 833 COMMISSION & ORS. [MANOJ MISRA, J.] Appellants herein are those candidates who failed to fi nd their name in the select list prepared after the recruitment exercise under the fi rst advertisement for Post Code 447. In this appeal, I.A. No. 56457 of 2022 has been fi led for bringing on record copy of the dated 29th March 2022 passed by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 113 of 2019 whereby the said writ petition was dismissed by a Single Bench of the High Court. Another I.A. No. 100627 of 2022 has been fi led by a bunch of candidates who claim to have possessed qualifi cations higher than the one specifi ed in the Advertisement for Post Code 447. According to them, they hold Degree instead of Diploma and Degree being higher than Diploma, they were eligible. Yet another I.A. No. 188852 of 2022 has been fi led to bring on record: (i) An RTI query report dated 02.07.2022. This is to the eff ect that the relaxation dated 21.08.2017 was not published in any Newspaper, E-Gazette or Offi cial website; and (ii) A chart containing reasons as to why some of the selected candidates were not qualifi ed/ eligible for consideration against Post Code 447. Note: It is not clear whether this chart was ever placed before the High Court. (D) Arising out of SLP (C) No. 9977 of 2022: This appeal is by those candidates who participated under the second advertisement and got selected for appointment against Post Code 556. They are aggrieved by the direction contained in paragraph 33 of the impugned . They apprehend that if the merit-list is re-drawn by including those who were otherwise ineligible under the 2014 Rules, they may go out of the merit-list. Their case is thus identical to the appellants in the appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 730 of 2022. In this appeal, I.A. No. 77624 of 2022 has been fi led to bring on record an application fi led by one of the candidates under the advertisement for Post Code 556 to initiate contempt proceeding against the State for non- compliance of the directions contained in the impugned of the High Court. 834 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. (E) Arising out of SLP (C) No. 17676 of 2022: This appeal is by those who have applied under the third advertisement dated 21.09.2020 qua Code 817. Their grievance is that if the direction given in paragraphs 33 and 34 of impugned is implemented, the number of posts advertised would get reduced thereby aff ecting their chances of selection.
