1078 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 16. In para 35 of the impugned , the High Court observed that the contemnors had not only violated the undertaking given to the court but had also taken undue advantage unto themselves, namely, the sale consideration having fl own from the purchasers to the contemnors. The High Court in this regard observed the following in para 35: “35. In the instant case the contemnors have not only violated the undertaking given to the Court but have also taken undue advantage unto themselves namely the sale consideration has fl own from the purchasers to the vendors i.e. the contemnors. Even according to the recitals found in the Sale Deeds referred to in the tabular column hereinabove, it is depicted as Rs.2,82,730/- (in respect of 11 Sale Deeds); in respect of 2 Sale Deeds executed in the year 2017-18, the consideration has been depicted as Rs.3,40,230/-. As per the index value, the consideration amount or proper market value in respect of 11 Sale Deeds would be Rs.67,38,432/-; whereas in respect of 2 Sale Deeds the consideration or proper market value as per index value would be Rs.76,05,666/-. In the reply affi davits fi led by contemnors Nos.3.1 to 3.4, there is not even a whisper with regard to consideration amount. They neither contend nor plead that the consideration that has fl own under the said Sale Deeds have not been received by them. On the contrary, the affi davit-in-rejoinder fi led on behalf of the petitioners against the reply fi led by respondent Nos.3.1 to 3.4, it has been specifi cally contended by the complainants that contemners in to hoodwink and overreach the process of law, an imaginary plea has been projected by way of defense that "cash" transaction of Rs.8,500/- took place for such sale in the year 2012 wherein no date is mentioned. In fact, the defence put-forth by contemnor No.3.1 to the eff ect that she is a housewife, has been denied in the rejoinder affi davit fi led by applicants by raising a specifi c plea that in Special Civil Suit No.130 of 1995 fi led before the 2nd Additional Senior Civil Judge, Surat, respondent No.4 in the cross-examination has deposed that respondent No.3.1 is engaged in the textile business and she is a Director of M/s. Surat Fabric Cap Company Limited and in the same breath he has deposed that all the members of the family were aware of the dated 14.10.2015 BALWANTBHAI SOMABHAI BHANDARI v. HIRALAL 1079 SOMABHAI CONTRACTOR (DECEASED) REP. BY LRS. & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] passed by this Court. Insofar as rejoinder affi davit to the reply affi davit fi led by respondent No.3.2, complainants have specifi cally contended that respondent No.3.2 was very well aware of the dated 14.10.2015 and same is the statement made in the rejoinder affi davit fi led against the reply fi led by respondent No.3.3 and 3.4. It is also contended that sale consideration depicted in the Sale Deeds are farce and to overreach the of the Court less consideration has been refl ected as against the real value.
