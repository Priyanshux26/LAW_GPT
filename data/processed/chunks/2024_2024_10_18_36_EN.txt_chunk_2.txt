The State of Manipur is represented by Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General and Mr. V. Giri and Mr. K. Parameshwar, learned senior counsel. Also heard Mr. Anupam Lal Das, learned senior counsel appearing for the already appointed candidates. 3. These matters pertain to the process of recruitment of, inter-alia, 1423 posts of Primary Teachers in the state of Manipur. The recruitment process commenced with the notification dated 12.09.2006 issued by the Employment Officer, Imphal West which required the aspirants to have their names sponsored through the Employment Exchange. The same notice also notified vacancies of 203 Primary Hindi Teachers and 46 Hindi Graduate Teachers, all in the Directorate of Education in Government of Manipur. At the outset, it is made clear that in this , we are dealing with the case of 1423 Primary Teachers only. 4. For the purpose of this , the records of Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (Civil) No. 15482 of 2016 together with the convenience compilation filed in the W.P (C) No.817 of 2016 are taken into account to narrate the salient circumstances of the case. 5. On 22.12.2006, the Board of Secondary Education, Manipur (hereinafter referred to as, “the Board”) conducted a written test and 22 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the result of the test was declared on 16.04.2007 by the Secretary of the Board indicating that 5322 candidates were successful in the written examination. The interviews for the short-listed candidates were held from 06.02.2009 and continued till August, 2009. At that stage a local daily in Manipur on 26.06.2010, published the result of the selection process when official results were yet to be declared for the subject recruitment. The said newspaper publication led to an Enquiry Committee being constituted by the Government of Manipur to determine whether any illegality has been committed by the Recruitment Committee (referred to as, “the DPC” by the authorities and courts) in the selection process pursuant to notification dated 12.09.2006. 6. Thereafter, on 07.03.2011, the Director (Education), Government of Manipur notified that 1051 Primary Teachers would be engaged on contract basis on remuneration of Rs.7600 per month. The breakup of the list of 1051 appointees was (Gen.-512, OBC–177, ST–322, SC–21 and PH–19). Since most of the names in the notification dated 7.3.2011 were amongst the names published in the local newspaper on 26.06.2010, the leakage of the select list received the attention of the Manipur Legislative Assembly when it was clarified by the Chief Minister of Manipur before the House that the appointments made through the notification dated 07.03.2011 was a temporary arrangement, since the academic session is to commence from April, 2011. 7. As the official result of the selection process was not declared despite the process having commenced on 12.09.2006, some of the aggrieved candidates moved the High Court and pursuant to the passed by the High Court on 27.07.2011, the result of the selection was notified on 04.09.2011 by the Director of Education, Government of Manipur indicating that 1423 candidates are selected for the 1423 posts of Primary Teachers, in pursuant to the recruitment process which commenced on 12.09.2006.
