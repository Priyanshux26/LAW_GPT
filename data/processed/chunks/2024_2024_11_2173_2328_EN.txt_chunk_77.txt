Mass 1998) 285 173 F.3d 933 2270 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports do not even prohibit Hooters from placing its managers themselves on the list. Further, nothing in the rules restricts Hooters from punishing arbitrators who rule against the company by removing them from the list. Given the unrestricted control that one party (Hooters) has over the panel, the selection of an impartial decisionmaker would be a surprising result.” The Court noted that arbitration is a system where disputes between parties are resolved by an impartial third party and allowing one party to control the arbitral tribunal was against the principles of arbitration.286 154. In McMullen v. Meijer,287 the issue before the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was whether the arbitration agreement provided the employee “an effective substitute for the judicial forum”. The agreement allowed the employer to unilaterally select a pool of at least five potential arbitrators. The employer and employee were required to mutually select a sole arbitrator from that pool of arbitrators by alternatively striking names until only one remained. The Court held that the process of selection of the arbitrator prevented the arbitration from being an effective substitute for a judicial forum because: (i) the employer exercised unilateral control over the entire panel; (ii) the arbitrator selection procedure allowed the employer to create a symbiotic relationship with its arbitrators, which promulgated bias; and (iii) the arbitrator selection procedure inherently lacked fairness and neutrality. iii. Public-private contracts and public policy of arbitration 155. Although arbitration law is an autonomous legal field,288 it functions within the boundaries prescribed by the state. For instance, adjudication of certain proceedings is reserved by the legislature exclusively for the courts as a matter of public policy.289 The non- arbitrable proceedings generally include disputes relating to rights and 286 Hooters of Am Inc (supra) 939 287 355 F.3d 485, 493 288 Cox and Kings (supra) [95] 289 Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. v.

Section 34 of the Arbitration Act specifies the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award.
