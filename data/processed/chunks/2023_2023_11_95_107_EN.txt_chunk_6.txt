of NCT of Delhi) v. Sunil [(2001) 1 SCC 652 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 248] and Ramjee Rai v. State of Bihar [(2006) 13 SCC 229 : (2007) 2 SCC (Cri) 626] has laid down recently in Kashmiri Lal v. State of Haryana [(2013) 6 SCC 595 : 2013 AIR SCW 3102] that there is no absolute command of law that the police officers cannot be cited as witnesses and their testimony should always be treated with 10 (2013) 6 SCC 588 104 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. suspicion. Ordinarily, the public at large show their disinclination to come forward to become witnesses. If the testimony of the police offi cer is found to be reliable and trustworthy, the court can defi nitely act upon the same. If, in the course of scrutinising the evidence, the court fi nds the evidence of the police offi cer as unreliable and untrustworthy, the court may disbelieve him but it should not do so solely on the presumption that a witness from the Department of Police should be viewed with distrust. This is also based on the principle that quality of the evidence weighs over the quantity of evidence. 23. Referring to State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) v. Sunil11, in Kulwinder Singh v. State of Punjab12 this court held that: – “23. … That apart, the case of the prosecution cannot be rejected solely on the ground that independent witnesses have not been examined when, on the perusal of the evidence on record the Court fi nds that the case put forth by the prosecution is trustworthy. When the evidence of the offi cial witnesses is trustworthy and credible, there is no reason not to rest the conviction on the basis of their evidence.” 24. We must note, that in the former it was observed:- “21… At any rate, the court cannot start with the presumption that the police records are untrustworthy. As a proposition of law the presumption should be the other way around. That offi cial acts of the police have been regularly performed is a wise principle of presumption and recognised even by the legislature… If the court has any good reason to suspect the truthfulness of such records of the police the court could certainly take into account the fact that no other independent person was present at the time of recovery. But it is not a legally approvable procedure to presume the police action as unreliable to start with, nor to jettison such action merely for the reason that police did not collect signatures of independent persons in the documents made contemporaneous with such actions.” 25. Recently, this Court in Mohd. Naushad v.State (NCT of Delhi13) had observed that the testimonies of police witnesses, as well as 11 (2001) 1 SCC 652 12 2015) 6 SCC 674 13 2023 SCC OnLine SC 784 SATHYAN v. STATE OF KERALA 105 [SANJAY KAROL, J.] pointing out memos do not stand vitiated due to the absence of independent witnesses.
