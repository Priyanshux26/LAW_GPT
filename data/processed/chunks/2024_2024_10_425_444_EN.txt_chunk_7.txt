It is pertinent to note that the Request For Bid (RFB) annexed to the NIT, contained “Instructions to Bidders” in Section II thereof. The Clause 2.1.6 of the said Instructions stated that non-compliance with any of the bidding instructions may lead to rejection of the Bid. Further, Clause 2.2.5 thereof specifically stated that the Bidder shall furnish the requisite documents listed in Paragraphs 9 and Paragraphs 10 of NIT. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 437 Banshidhar Construction Pvt. Ltd. v. Bharat Coking Coal Limited & Others 15. From the bare perusal of the afore stated Clause 10, it clearly transpires that the Bidders were required to furnish the information and the scanned copies of the documents relating to qualification criteria particularly to substantiate their Financial capacity. For the purpose of substantiating Financial Capacity, the Bidders were obliged to submit the scanned copies (self-certified and notarised/ certified) of the Audited Annual Reports for the last three financial years as chosen by the Bidder, comprising of the audited balance sheets and profit and loss accounts of the Bidder, along with other documents as stated therein. This was the mandatory requirement of the NIT, the same being related to the qualification criteria as also transpiring from Clause 2.2.5 of the RFB. 16. Admittedly, the Respondent No.8 had not submitted the scanned copies of its audited Annual Reports for the last three financial years, at the time of submitting/uploading the bid documents, before the last date fixed i.e 01.12.2023 and the same were submitted on 17.04.2024 only when the clarification was sought from the Respondent No.8, after the Technical bids were opened on 04.12.2023.
