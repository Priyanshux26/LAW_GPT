[Para 46] MUNNA PANDEY v. STATE OF BIHAR 1007 Practice and Procedure – Criminal Law – Duty of Presiding Judge – Evidence Act, 1872 – s.165: Held: In many sessions cases when an advocate appointed by the Court appears and particularly when a junior advocate not having much experience of the procedure of the Court, has been appointed to conduct the defence of an accused person, it is the duty of the Presiding Judge to draw his attention to the statutory provisions of s.145, Evidence Act – No Court should allow a witness to be contradicted by reference to the previous statement in writing or reduced to writing unless the procedure set out in s.145, Evidence Act has been followed – It is possible that if the attention of the witness is drawn to these portions with reference to which it is proposed to contradict him, he may be able to give a perfectly satisfactory explanation and in that event the portion in the previous statement which would otherwise be contradictory would no longer go to contradict or challenge the testimony of the witness – In a case like the present one, where the evidence given in Court implicates persons who not mentioned in the FIR or police statements, it is always advisable and far more important for the Trial Judge to look into the police papers in to ascertain whether the persons implicated by witnesses, at the trial had been implicated by them during the investigation. [Paras 47 and 48] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.53(1), 53A – Medical examination – Importance – Circumstantial evidence – Rape victim dead: Held: s.53(1) enables a police offi cer not below the rank of sub- inspector to request a registered medical practitioner, to make such an examination of the person arrested, as is reasonably necessary to ascertain the facts which may aff ord such evidence, whenever a person is arrested on a charge of committing an off ence of such a nature that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of his person will aff ord evidence as to the commission of an off ence – By Amendment Act 25 of 2005, a new Explanation was substituted u/s.53, in the place of the original Explanation – Simultaneously with the substitution of a new Explanation u/s.53, Act 25 of 2005 also inserted a new provision i.e. s.53A – Medical examination of an accused assumes great importance in cases where the victim of rape is dead and the off ence is sought to be established only by circumstantial evidence – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 376 – Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2005.
