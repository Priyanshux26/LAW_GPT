This of the High Court is challenged in the present appeals. CONTENTIONS OF THE COUNSEL 17.1 Assailing the legality of the dated 20.8.2020, Mr. D S.V. Raju, learned ASG, argues that for computation of the prescribed 60/90 day remand period, one of the days on either side of the remand period has to be excluded and in the present case, either the date of remand i.e. 14.5.2020 or the 60thday i.e. 12.07.2020 must be excluded for computing the eligibility for default bail. In support of the ED’s E contentions, Mr. Raju would place strong reliance, inter-alia, on Aslam Babalal Desai vs. State of Maharashtra10, State of MP vs. Rustam (supra) and Ravi Prakash Singh alias Arvind Singh vs. State of Bihar (supra). 17.2 An alternate argument is also made to the effect that even if F the period of 60 days as stipulated under the first proviso to Section 167 (2) of the CrPC expired on 12.7.2020, the same being a Sunday, the provisions of Section 10, General Clauses Act would come into play and as such the 60 day period which expired on Sunday will stand extended to Monday i.e. 13.7.2020. In support of such contention, Mr. Raju placed reliance on N. Sureya Reddy vs. State of Orissa11. G 17.3. The learned ASG additionally argued that the ratio in Chaganti (supra) was wrongly relied upon by the High Court to compute the period of default bail under the first proviso to Section 167 (2) of the 10 (1992) 4 SCC 272. 11 1985 Crl. LJ 939 (Ori) H 932 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A CrPC. Since the date of arrest is the same as the date of remand, the ratio in Chaganti (supra) according to the learned ASG has no application and was therefore wrongly applied by the High Court in the present facts. 18.1 Per contra, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, Mr. Kapil Sibal and Mr. Amit B Desai, learned Senior Counsels for the respondents, argue that the period envisaged under proviso (a) of Section 167 (2) of the CrPC must be calculated from the date of remand and exclusion of the first day of the Court’s gaze upon the accused would be illogical. The counsel have based their arguments on the ratio in Chaganti (supra) which was approved in several subsequent judgements such as CBI Special C Investigation Cell, New Delhi Vs Anupama Kulkarni (supra), Pragyna Singh Thakur Vs. State of Maharashtra12. The counsels for the respondents also rely on the decisions in State Vs. Mohd Ashraf Bhat (supra), S.Kasi Vs. State13, and Gautam Navlakha Vs. NIA (supra). DISCUSSION D 19. In the impugned , the learned Judge of the Bombay High Court had cited with approval, the of a coordinate Bench in Deepak Satyavan Kudalkar vs. State of Maharashtra,14 where all the previous s of the Supreme Court applicable for default bail were considered and analyzed. We may benefit from the opinion penned E down by Prakash D. Naik J., who had analyzed the applicable provisions of the CrPC in the following paragraph.
