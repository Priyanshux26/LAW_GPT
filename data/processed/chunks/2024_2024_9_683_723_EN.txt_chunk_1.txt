[Paras 17, 18, 20] [Per Surya Kant, J.] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.41A(3) – Penal Code, 1860 – s.477A – Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – s.7 – Whether there was violation of Section 41A(3) of the CrPC: Held: First, it is trite law that there is no insurmountable hurdle in the conversion of judicial custody into police custody by an of [2024] 9 S.C.R. 685 Arvind Kejriwal v. Central Bureau of Investigation a Magistrate – Thus, there is no impediment in terms of arresting a person already in custody for the purposes of investigation, whether for the same offence or for an altogether different offence – The appellant’s arrest by the CBI was thus entirely permissible, in light of the trial Court’s dated 25.06.2024 wherein the trial Court, after considering the reasons, allowed the CBI’s application for the appellant’s arrest – Second, Section 41A(3) allows for arrest, provided the reasons are recorded, justifying the necessity of such a step, and the police officer is satisfied that the individual should be arrested – In this context, the CBI, in their application dated 25.06.2024, clearly recorded the reasons as to why they deemed the appellant’s arrest necessary – These reasons were also summarized in the arrest memo dated 26.06.2024 – Third, s.41A(1), when r/w.s.41A(3) CrPC, does not impose an absolute prohibition on the arrest of an individual against whom there exists reasonable suspicion of having committed a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment up to seven years – This is evident from the language of the provision itself – S.41A(3) explicitly states that an arrest is permissible if the police officer believes it to be necessary and duly records the reasons for such arrest – This provision thus essentially carves out an exception to the general rule u/s. 41A, which mandates that an individual whose appearance is required should not be arrested u/s.41(1) of the CrPC. [Paras 25, 26, 27, 28] [Per Surya Kant, J.] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.41(1)(b)(ii) – Penal Code, 1860 – s.477A – Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – s.7 – Whether s.41(1)(b)(ii) of the CrPC is applicable: Held: Section 41(1)(b)(ii) of the CrPC clearly stipulates that an arrest under this provision can be made based on a complaint or credible information that an individual has committed a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, with or without a fine – However, such an arrest must be conducted subject to the satisfaction of specific conditions outlined in sub-sections (a) to (e) – The said provision is inapplicable to the vicissitudes of the present factual matrix – Here is a case where the court upon application of judicial mind accorded its approval to the appellant’s arrest for which necessary warrant was issued – There was thus no occasion for the arresting police officer to form an opinion regarding the existence of valid reasons of arrest – The competent court having undertaken such a task, the police officer cannot be expected to sit over the of the court.
