A The Union Government may then establish the SAT upon receiving a request, in terms of Section 4(2) of the Administrative Tribunals Act. The decision to establish an SAT is undoubtedly an administrative decision. Administrative decisions, unlike quasi-judicial decisions, may be reversed by the application of B Section 21 of the General Clauses Act.

The subject matter and the context of the Administrative Tribunals Act, too, B do not militate against the application of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act.

The Union Government in turn has the implied power to rescind the notification by which that SAT was established, thereby abolishing the SAT.
