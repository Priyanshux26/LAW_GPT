(Miscellaneous Application No.184 of 2023) In (Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.8553 of 2022) With (Civil Appeal No(s). 4591 of 2023) OCTOBER 19, 2023 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT AND ARAVIND KUMAR, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Whether revision of fee by an arbitral tribunal would terminate the mandate of the tribunal on the ground of ineligibility as per s. 12 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – ss. 12, 13 and 14 – Grounds and procedure of challenge – Failure or impossibility of the arbitrator or tribunal to act – Arbitration proceedings between the parties – Tribunal revised the hearing fee for each arbitrator fi xed at Rs 1,00,000/- per session to Rs 2,00,000/- per session of three hours – Respondent paid the revised fee for fi ve hearings – Application u/s. 14 by the appellant challenging the mandate of the tribunal that the payment of the disputed increased amount by one party, caused prejudice to the appellant and not be treated in an impartial manner by the tribunal, resulting in the tribunal to become de jure unable to perform its functions as required – Dismissal of the application by the High Court – Correctness: Held: Fixation of fee, is contractual, and wherever there is no prior arrangement or court , the tribunal has to fi x it at the threshold – Fee increase can be resorted to only with the agreement of parties; in the event 995 996 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. of disagreement by one party, the tribunal has to continue with the previous arrangement, or decline to act as arbitrator – By insisting that the increase of fee should prevail does not amount to a per se ineligibility, reaching to the level of voiding the tribunal’s appointment, and terminating its mandate – Plea of the applicant that the concept of de jure ineligibility because of existence of justifi able doubts about impartiality or independence of the tribunal on unenumerated grounds or other than those outlined as statutory ineligibility conditions in terms of s.12(5), cannot be sustained – Grounds other than those mentioned in the said schedule, occasioning an application in terms of s.12(3) cannot be conceived – In case, applicants plea is upheld, the consequences could well be an explosion in the court docket and other unforeseen results – Skipping the statutory route carefully devised by Parliament can cast yet more spells of uncertainty upon the arbitration process – De jure condition is not the key which unlocks the doors that bar challenges, mid-stream, and should “not to unlock the gates which shuts the court out” from what could potentially become causes of arbitrator challenge, during the course of arbitration proceedings, other than what the Act specifi cally provides for – Direction to the arbitrators to resume the proceedings and decide the case in accordance with law.
