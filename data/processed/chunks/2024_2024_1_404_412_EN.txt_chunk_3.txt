[2024] 1 S.C.R. 409 State of Haryana v. Mohd. Yunus & Ors. 10. During the course of trial, the prosecution examined the complainant/ eye-witness-Deenu (PW-1), injured eye-witness- Ahmad (PW-2), Dr. M.S. Ranga (PW-3), Constable Sarwan Kumar (PW-4), Head Constable Sunil Dutt (PW-5), Constable Raj Kumar (PW-6), Dr. Chander Kant (PW-7), ASI Siri Niwas (PW-8), Head Constable Hari Kishan (PW-9) and SI Daya Nand (PW-10). However, listed prosecution witnesses namely, Harun, Abdul Rashid, Mozam Khan, Rati Mohd. And Fattu were gave up being unnecessary. In defence, accused appellants submitted certified copy of complaint made by Ghasita (A3) against deceased-Akbar, PW Harun and others for offences punishable under Sections 379, 380, 411, 406, 407, 452, 120-B, 506, 427 and 403 IPC for illegal cutting and removal of 13 trees belonging to the Panchayat. A copy of pedigree showing 4th degree relationship between prosecution witnesses namely, Deenu and Ahmad as well as certified copy of statement of Ghasita (A3) as prosecution witness in trial “State vs. Tundal etc.” under Section 304 IPC were also submitted. 11. Upon their conviction by the Trial Court, Mohd. Yunus (A1), Mohd. Jamil (A2) and Ghasita (A3) preferred appeal before the High Court which was dismissed qua Mohd. Jamil (A2) and Ghasita (A3) whereas appeal preferred by Mohd. Jamil (A1) was allowed in part. In the separate trial, Akhtar Hussain (A4) was acquitted which was affirmed by the High Court against which there is no further appeal. 12. In the present Criminal Appeal No.1308 of 2012, we are required to consider the legality and validity of conviction imposed upon Jamil (A2) whereas in the Criminal Revision, the State has called in question Yunus (A1) acquittal under Section 302 IPC. 13. It was argued by the learned counsel for the appellant-Mohd. Jamil (A2) that the FIR is ante-timed and delayed; the conviction is based on the testimony of interested witnesses who are closely related to the deceased and the prosecution has failed to examine the independent witnesses namely, Harun and Deenu s/o Kalu. It is also argued that the presence of informant (PW-1) is doubtful considering the statement of Ahmad (PW-2) recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. in which he did not mention that Deenu (PW-1) was present at the spot; moreover, Deenu’s clothes were not smeared with blood, although Deenu deposed in his statement that after the deceased 410 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports suffered injuries he lifted him in an injured condition and put him in the tractor.
