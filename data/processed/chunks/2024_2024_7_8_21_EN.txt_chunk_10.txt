The alleged cheque of the prosecutrix’s mother given to the appellant or the bank statement to indicate transfer of such money have not been gathered by the police. In the absence of such materials, the entire sub-stratum of the prosecutrix’s case collapses. Thus, there is hardly any possibility of conviction of the appellant. As a matter of fact, it is not even a case which can stand trial. It appears to be a case of a consensual relationship which had gone sour leading to lodging of FIR. In the circumstances, Court is of the view that compelling the appellant to face the criminal trial on these materials would be nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court, result of the trial being a foregone conclusion. 25. From the factual matrix of the case, the following relevant features can be culled out: (i) the relationship between the appellant and the prosecutrix was of a consensual nature; (ii) the parties were in a relationship for a period of almost two years; and (iii) though there were talks between the parties and their family members regarding marriage, the same did not fructify leading to lodging of FIR. 26. That being the position and having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that it would be in the interest of justice if the proceedings are terminated at this stage itself. Consequently, impugned of the High Court dated 03.10.2019 and the of the Sessions Judge dated 24.04.2019 are hereby set aside and quashed. 27. Resultantly, proceedings in Sessions Trial No. 505/2018, pending before the 10th Additional Sessions Judge, Gwalior, are hereby quashed. 28. Consequently, the appeal is allowed. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
