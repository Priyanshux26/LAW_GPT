5 SCR 469 : (1998) 2 SCC 109 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1289 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 1958142 and the Assam Disturbed Areas Act 1955 was under challenge. ASFPA was enacted to confer special powers upon the members of the armed forces in the disturbed areas in Assam and Manipur. In terms of the Act, the Governor of the State had the power to issue a notification declaring the whole or any part of the State to which the Act applies as a disturbed area.143 The Act was amended by Act 7 of 1972 by which the power to issue a notification was also conferred on the Central Government. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the amendment Bill stated that it was important that the power to issue notifications is extended to the Central Government (in addition to the Governor) in view of the duty cast on the Union by Article 355.144 One of the contentions of the petitioners for challenging the constitutional validity of the enactment was that Parliament had the competence to enact laws with respect to ‘armed rebellion’ only in exercise of emergency powers under Articles 352 and 356.145 The Constitution Bench rejected this argument. Justice Agarwal, writing for the Bench observed that AFSPA was enacted to enable the Central Government to discharge its obligation under Article 355. The learned Judge observed that a proclamation under Article 356 had grave consequences and thus, it was open to Parliament to deal with external aggression and internal disturbances through legislation before the Governor exercises powers under Article 356.146 Further, this Court also observed that the power of the Central Government to issue a notification under AFSPA does not violate the federal structure in view of Article 355.147 85. In Naga People’s Movement of Human Rights (supra) and Sarbananda Sonawal (supra), this Court referred to Article 355 for the purpose of emphasising that one of the duties that is cast upon the Union is to protect States against external aggression and internal disturbance. In Naga People’s Movement of Human Rights (supra), the legislative object of the 1972 amendment to ASFPA was traced to Article 355. Similarly, in Sarbananda Sonawal (supra), the 142 “AFSPA” 143 AFSPA; Section 3 144 [1997] Supp. 5 SCR 469 : (1998) 2 SCC 109 [14] 145 [1997] Supp. 5 SCR 469 : (1998) 2 SCC 109 [28] 146 [1997] Supp. 5 SCR 469 : (1998) 2 SCC 109 [32] 147 [1997] Supp. 5 SCR 469 : (1998) 2 SCC 109 [41] 1290 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports legislative object of the IMDT Act and the IMDT Rules was traced to Article 355. Though the three-Judge Bench in paragraph 67 of the held that the IMDT Act and Rules were unconstitutional for violation of Article 355 of the Constitution, the scrutiny of the legislation and Rules was on Article 14 grounds. The reasons summarised in paragraph 82 of this elucidate that the framework of analysis was limited to a comparison of the provisions of the IMDT Act and Rules (applicable to Assam) and the Foreigners Act (applicable to the rest of India).
