13. However, if the charges in the departmental enquiry and the criminal court are identical or similar, and if the evidence, witnesses and circumstances are one and the same, then the matter acquires a diff erent dimension. If the court in judicial review concludes that the acquittal in the criminal proceeding was after full consideration of the prosecution evidence and that the prosecution miserably failed to prove the charge, the Court in judicial review can grant redress in certain circumstances. The court will be entitled to exercise its discretion and grant relief, if it concludes that allowing the fi ndings in the disciplinary proceedings to stand will be unjust, unfair and oppressive. Each case will turn on its own facts. [See G.M. Tank vs. State of Gujarat & Others, (2006) 5 SCC 446, State Bank of Hyderabad vs. P. Kata Rao, (2008) 15 SCC 657 and S. Samuthiram (supra)] Discussion: Validity of the Disciplinary proceeding – Question No. 1: 14. A brief analysis of the facts of the case is essential. The origin of this dispute, which does not inspire confi dence at all, is as follows. The appellant’s cousin Shravan Lal (PW-4 in the departmental enquiry and PW-6 in the criminal case), deposed as under before the enquiry offi cer :- “Stated on enquiry that about 13 months ago, I was operating engine at Well. On that day at about 3.00 p.m., Ramlal after drinking liquor, came at well and switched off the engine. Thereafter, Ramlal abused me and scuffl ed with me and said that today I will operate the engine and you cannot do anything to me. I have received job by fooling the Government. When I enquired him that how you did that, then, Ramlal told me that I have received job by altering my date of birth as 21.04.1972 in my marksheet, whereas, my date of birth was 21.04.1974. Thereafter I went to school and enquired about this fact, whereupon I came to know that his date of birth was 21.04.1974. Due to this reason, I produced an application before the Superintendent of Police, Ajmer and made one report to the Commandant, 9th Battalion, 814 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. RAC, Tonk and I also made one report to the Hon’ble Chief Minister and one report to DIG, RAC, Rajasthan, Jaipur…..” An F.I.R. was registered on 02.09.2002. A charge-sheet in the departmental proceeding was issued on 02.04.2003. It will be relevant to extract the two charges in the disciplinary proceedings: “Charge No.1 :- In the year 1991, an application for appointment on the post of constable was made by you, alongwith which, Marksheet of 8th pass issued by Government Secondary School, Tiloniya (Ajmer), bearing Roll No. 323 and Admission No. 2314, in which, your date of birth was mentioned as 21.04.1974, but you by altering it to 21.04.1972, fraudulently got recruited on the post of Constable. Charge No.2:- As a result of altering your date of birth from 21.04.1974 to 21.04.1972 in the Marksheet issued by the Government Secondary School, Tiloniya (Ajmer), Crime No.
