While interpreting any of these provisions, it shall always be advisable to examine the scope and impact of such interpretation on all the three constitutional aspects emerging from these Parts.” (Emphasis supplied) 42. The development of scientific temper is to be read with another limb of the DPSPs and Fundamental Duties enshrined in the Constitution that is Article 48A and Article 51A(g) respectively which speaks of protection of the environment. As already noticed above, these three parts forming the heart and soul of the Constitution have to be read as a whole and as such any and all considerations of modernising agriculture or building a scientific temper would also be required to necessarily consider and abide by the duty to protect the environment. 46 [2012] 4 SCR 971 : (2012) 5 SCC 1 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1949 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. 43. It is also to be noted that, similar to when a legislative body enacts a legislation there is a presumption of constitutionality unless proven otherwise, similarly, a policy decision when taken by the competent authority enters the fray of enforcement with a presumption in its favour of being in public interest, unless otherwise shown, demonstarted and proven to be among other grounds, manifestly arbitrary. This presumption extends, subject of course to just exceptions, to the authority having considered duties as discussed above in framing policies for GMOs. 44. It must be kept in mind that India is a global agricultural powerhouse and from an economic standpoint, rural India is still largely dependent on agriculture. This court has stated in Electrosteels (supra) that the Court cannot be oblivious to the economy. Therefore, informed agricultural policy decisions must be viewed in that conspectus, which is to further and supplement India’s development, growth and self-sustenance. The relevance of such policy decisions being that, for instance, as submitted by the Union of India, India has been dependent on imports to meet more than half of the edible oil demand [55.76%, 155.33 Lakh Tonnes (2022-23) – Rs.1,15,000/- crores in 2020-21]. Therefore, in my view, the use of GM technology has to be seen in this backdrop. 45. On numerous occassions, this Court has reiterated the view discussed in the preceding paragraphs. 45.1 This Court in State of U.P. v. Abhay Nandan Inter College47 (2-Judge Bench) observed: “36. A policy decision is presumed to be in public interest, and such a decision once made is not amenable to challenge, until and unless there is manifest or extreme arbitrariness, a constitutional court is expected to keep its hands off.” 45.2 In State of Punjab v. Khan Chand48 (5-Judge Bench), KK Mathew J. dissenting, observed: “23. … Courts and parties all assume that the Legislature always wants protection of the public interest, to serve public cause and do things for public good or to exercise 47 [2021] 10 SCR 693 : (2021) 15 SCC 600 48 [1974] 2 SCR 768 : (1974) 1 SCC 549 1950 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
