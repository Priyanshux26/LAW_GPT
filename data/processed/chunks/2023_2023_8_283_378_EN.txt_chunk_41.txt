Such a finding was recorded in the teeth of a categorical stand taken by defendant No.1 that Item Nos.38 and 39 are in the possession of the State Government. E 129. In fact, all the parties before us admitted that in one portion of the property there is a building housing the Hyderabad Metro Water Works and Sewerage Board. We do not know how despite such an admission, the Government can be said to be an interloper and a meddler. 130. As we have stated elsewhere, it can be seen from the Plaint F Schedule IV which was made part of the and decree dated 28.06.1963,that the property which is the subject matter of the litigation on hand, finds a place at Serial No.32 of Annexure IV to the and decree and it corresponds to Item No.38 of Plaint Schedule IV. The description of this property in the Plaint Schedule IV reads as follows:- G “Hydernagar patta lands. Compact area of 1210 acres” 131. What was included as Item No.38 of Plaint Schedule IV and enlisted at Serial No.32 of Annexure IV to the and decree, did not contain (i) either the survey numbers of Patta lands; or (ii) the boundaries of the land. Column No.4 of the table in Annexure IV to the H 346 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A and decree, contains details of the name of Mahalla or place. As against Hydernagar Patta lands, what was indicated in Column No.4 was “Hydernagar Taluk: Garbi”. Nobody knew and nobody cared to find out before the delivery of the dated 28.06.1963 as to whether Hydernagar was a village or Taluk and whether the whole of Hydernagar comprised of land, only of the total extent of 1210 acres or B something more. If the total extent of land available in Hydernagar was only 1210 acres, it would have been mentioned in the Plaint Schedule as “the whole of Hydernagar”. On the other hand, if what was included was only part of Hydernagar, the survey numbers and boundaries ought to have been mentioned. But it was not done. C 132. In fact, the in support of the preliminary decree contains a conundrum. The Court first recorded that 50 issues arose for consideration in the suit. Out of the 50 issues originally framed for consideration, Issue No.14(a) concerned Item No.38 (Hydernagar) specifically. This issue reads as follows:- D “14(a). Are the properties mentioned in Items 37 to 40 of Schedule IV, the maktas and inam properties and, if so, whether the civil court has no jurisdiction in relation to the same?” 133. The above Issue No.14(a) which directly concerned Item E No.38 of Plaint Schedule IV, was taken up by the learned Judge along with Issue No.13(c), which related to Item Nos. 35 and 36, in which certain office buildings in the possession of the Government were in existence. 134. On these two issues, namely Issue Nos. 13(c) and 14(a), F which were taken up together, the learned Judge rendered the following findings:- (i) that Item Nos.
