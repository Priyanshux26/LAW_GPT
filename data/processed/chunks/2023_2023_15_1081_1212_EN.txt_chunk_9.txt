This Court has been called upon to resolve an issue which arose in the context of three statutes – the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 19961, the Indian Stamp Act 18992, and the Indian Contract Act 1872.3 The Stamp Act imposes duty on “instruments”. An instrument which is unstamped or insuffi ciently stamped is inadmissible in evidence and cannot be acted upon in terms of its provisions. Arbitration agreements are often embedded in underlying instruments or substantive contracts. When an application is made for the appointment of an arbitrator, an objection is raised on the ground that the arbitration agreement is inadmissible because it is in an instrument which is unstamped or inadequately stamped. The primary issue that arises is whether such arbitration agreements would be non-existent, unenforceable, or invalid if the underlying contract is not stamped. A brief description of the context in which this question arises follows. 2. In N N Global Mercantile (P) Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd.,4 (hereinafter referred to as “N N Global 1”) a Bench of three Judges of this Court was called upon in a Special Leave Petition to determine the enforceability of an arbitration agreement contained in an unstamped work . The Bench, speaking through Justice Indu Malhotra, held that * Ed.
