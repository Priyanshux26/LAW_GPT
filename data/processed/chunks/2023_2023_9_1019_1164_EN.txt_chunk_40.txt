In respect of layouts whose total extent is above 10,000 sq.meters, it was made clear by the successive Government s that no charges in lieu of 10% of the area B can be accepted. This is borne out by— (1) G.O.Ms. No. 743, Housing and Urban Development, dated 10.5.1979, (2) G.O.Ms. No. 940, Housing and Urban Development, dated C 8.10.1982, (3) the Development Control Rules as of September, 2004 (hosted in the official website) and the Table contained therein under Rules 19(a) & 19(b), and (4) Regulation 29 and Annexure XX under the Development D Regulations of the year 2008.” We are fortified in our conclusion that the Rule in question was statutory in nature. Section 123 (2) contemplates that every rule made under the Act is to be laid as soon as may be on the table of the Legislative Assembly and it inter alia enables the Assembly to modify the rule and E if the Assembly decides that the rule should not be made or give it a modified operation or no effect, then such a decision of the Assembly will prevail. It is to be noticed that this is after providing that unless otherwise expressed, the rules come into force on the day on which they are published in the Gazette. This shows that the rule has life without reference to the Legislative Assembly. It is undoubtedly true that Section F 122 speaks of the power of the Government to make rules. While it is true that the Master Plan is to be prepared by the CMDA and the rules would form part of the Master Plan, the scheme of the rules would show that it is only with the approval of the Government that the rules along with the Master Plan come into force. We have already noticed G the effect of Section 32 as indeed it was considered by the learned Single Judge in the we have referred to. THE GIFT DEED IN VASANTH APARTMENTS CASE 45. The complaint about there being no rationale in allowing a developer who develops a layout which is between 3000 sq.m. and 10000 H ASSOCIATION OF VASANTH APARTMENTS’ OWNERS v. 1075 V. GOPINATH & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] sq.m. to pay the equivalent is to be found both in the circumstance that A it is permitted only when there is a physical complaint and also it is obvious that the local Authority would be expected to plough back the money equivalent into making available alternate facility by way of OSR in such cases. 46.
