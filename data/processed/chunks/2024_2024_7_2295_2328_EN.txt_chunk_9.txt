15.4. Merely because the challenge to the procedure has been made with respect to the registration, the submission of the defendants with respect to the delayed registration etc. gets washed out. 16. The said was assailed by way of Second Appeal by the respondent no.1, the subsequent purchaser (defendant no.2) only. No appeal was filed by the respondent no.2 (defendant no.1), vendor of the appellant. This appeal was registered as Second Appeal No.649 of 2019. 17. By the impugned dated 09.06.2022, the High Court has allowed the same and after setting aside the of the first Appellate Court, restored that of the Trial Court and dismissed the suit. It is this of the High Court, which is under challenge in the present appeal. The High Court framed the following substantial questions of law in paragraph 12 of the which are reproduced hereunder: - “12. The substantial questions of law raised in the appeal are: i) Whether execution of the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 at Exhibit 54 has been duly proved; ii) Whether the sale deed at Exhibit 54 conveys title in favour of plaintiffs; [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2309 Kaushik Premkumar Mishra & Anr. v. Kanji Ravaria @ Kanji & Anr. iii) Whether the findings of the first Appellate court on the issue of execution and validity of sale deed dated 02.12.1985 are not based on evidence on record and are perverse.” 18. The High Court recorded the following findings: 18.1. The sale deed in question dated 02.12.1985 could not be held to be invalid for the sole reason that the deed was signed only by the vendor and not by the vendees (in favour of plaintiffs). 18.2. The fact that the purchasers were minors would not per se affect the validity of the sale deed (in favour of plaintiffs). 18.3. It criticizes the findings of the first Appellate Court regarding the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 having been validly proved by the plaintiffs to be not based on consideration of material facts on record as discussed and considered by the Trial Court while holding that the sale deed was not validly proved. 18.4. It considered in great detail the provisions of the Registration Act to hold that the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 was not validly registered, as such, could not have been relied upon by the plaintiffs for any of the reliefs claimed by them or to maintain the suit. 19. We have heard Shri Vinay Navare, learned senior counsel for the appellants, Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for respondent No.2 and Shri Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior counsel representing respondent No.1. 20. The submissions of Shri Navare for the appellant may be summarized as under: 20.1. Respondent No.2 did not specifically deny execution of the sale deed in favour of appellant no.1 and his brother. He has only stated in the written statement that he does not recollect to have executed any such document. 20.2. Respondent No.2 did not cross-examine the appellant No.1 who had entered the witness box.
