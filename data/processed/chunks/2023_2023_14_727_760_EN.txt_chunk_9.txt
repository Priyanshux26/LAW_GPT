Such a power is essential for eliciting the truth as an obligation of oath could be. This is the reason the court also insists that the dying declaration should be of such nature as to inspire full confi dence of the court in its correctness.” 11.5.3 However, a note of caution has also been sounded. If such a declaration does not inspire confi dence in the mind of the court, i.e., there exist doubts about the correctness and genuineness thereof, it should not be acted upon, in the absence of corroborative evidence. 11.5.3.1 In Paniben v. State of Gujarat13 it was observed- “The Court has to be on guard that the statement of deceased was not as a result of either tutoring, prompting or a product of imagination.” A reference may also be made to K. Ramachandra Reddy v. Public Prosecutor14 11.6 The Court must be satisfi ed that at the time of making such a statement, the deceased was in a “fi t state of mind”. In Shama v. State of Haryana,15 a fi t state of mind has been held to be a prerequisite, alongside the ability to recollect the situation and the state of aff airs at that point in time in relation to the incident, to the satisfaction of the court. 11.6.1 In Uttam v. State of Maharashtra16, it was discussed that it is for the court to determine, from the evidence available 12 (2008) 17 SCC 190 [3 Judge Bench] 13 (1992) 2 SCC 474 [2 Judge Bench] 14 (1976) 3 SCC 618 [2 Judge Bench] 15 (2017) 11 SCC 535 [2 Judge Bench] 16 (2022) 8 SCC 576 [2 Judge Bench] 742 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. on record, the state of mind being fi t or not. 11.6.2 In to make a determination of the state of mind of the person making the dying declaration, the court ordinarily relies on medical evidence.17 However, equally, it has been held that if witnesses present, while the statement is being made, state that the deceased while making the statement was in a fi t state of mind, such statement would prevail over the medical evidence.18 The statement of witnesses present prevailing over the opinion of the doctor has been reiterated in Uttam (supra). 11.6.3 It has also, however, been held in Laxman (supra) that the mere absence of a doctor’s certifi cate in regard to the “fi t state of mind” of the dying declarant, will not ipso facto render such declaration unacceptable. This position had been once again recognised in Surendra Bangali @ Surendra Singh Routele v. State of Jharkhand19. 11.7 In case of a plurality of such statements, it has been observed that it is not the plurality but the reliability of such declaration determines its evidentiary value. The principle as held in Amol Singh v. State of M.P20 was:- “13. … it is not the plurality of the dying declarations but the reliability thereof that adds weight to the prosecution case. If a dying declaration is found to be voluntary, reliable and made in fi t mental condition, it can be relied upon without any corroboration [but] the statement should be consistent throughout.
