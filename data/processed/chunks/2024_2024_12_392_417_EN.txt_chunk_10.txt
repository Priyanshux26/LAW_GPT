In that case, the injury was caused with a knife blow to the stomach and it was inflicted with such force that the knife penetrated the abdomen of the deceased and caused injuries to the bowel. The expert opinion of the doctor therein stated on record that such an injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Further, in the absence of any evidence or circumstances to prove that the injury was accidental or unintentional, it was presumed that the accused had intended to cause such injury, thus making it fall under clause 3 of Section, 300 IPC. 25.5 It has been held by this Court in several cases such as Manubhai Atabhai vs. State of Gujarat,4 and Arun Nivalaji More vs. State of Maharashtra,5 that when the ocular evidence of eye witnesses are reliable and well corroborated by medical, and other evidence also inspires the confidence 3 [1958] SCR 1495 4 [2007] 7 SCR 1115 : (2007) 10 SCC 358 5 [2006] Supp. 4 SCR 301 : (2006) 12 SCC 613 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 407 Kunhimuhammed@Kunheethu v. The State of Kerala that the accused had the intention to cause such fatal injuries, then such evidence is enough to prove the charge of murder beyond reasonable doubt. This intention is to be gathered from a number of circumstances and evidence like the place of injury the nature of the weapon, the force applied while inflicting the injury, and other such considerations. Whether the accused had any intention to kill the deceased has to be judged upon taking into consideration the facts of each case. 25.6 This position has been elaborated by this Court in the case of Nishan Singh vs. State of Punjab,6 where the accused person had snatched the weapon carried by someone else and brutally inflicted injuries on the deceased. The Court stated that in such a case it cannot be said that he did not have the intention to cause death. 25.7 The prosecution established beyond doubt that these injuries were inflicted by the appellant–accused no. 1 using a knife, which was recovered during the investigation based on the appellant’s disclosure statement. PW-18, the Investigating Officer, corroborated this recovery, and the seizure report was further attested by PW-16, an independent witness. Further, the doctor PW-6 has stated that these injuries are sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. Cross-examination of these witnesses did not reveal any inconsistencies that could undermine the credibility of the evidence. Consequently, the courts have rightly concluded that the fatal injuries inflicted by the appellant were the direct cause of the deceased’s death. B. Intention to Commit Murder 25.8 The appellant’s primary defence has been the absence of intent to commit murder. However, intent can be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the act, including the nature and location of the injuries inflicted, the weapon used, and the actions of the appellant during the incident. The injuries were concentrated on the vital parts of the deceased’s body, such as the chest and ribs, which house critical organs like 6 [2008] 4 SCR 500 : (2008) 17 SCC 505 408 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
