v. P. Ravi Kumar and Ors. the relinquishment deed would be executed and registered and thereafter TDR would be issued, yet same was not issued though land owners complied with the demand made by BBMP; (ii). The State Government though passed a Government No. ma.aa.ee./269/MNY/2018 dated 17.07.2019 permitting issuance of TDR yet, same was not issued; (iii). Though a communication was addressed by the State Government to the Commissioner BBMP on 29.08.2019 to expedite the process of issuance of TDR yet, TDR was not issued;” 13. The above sequential events would clearly reflect that the State Government was projecting before this Court of its bona fides to implement the s of this Court and having failed in its attempt to seek modification of the dated 21.11.2014 on account of application for modification having been dismissed on 17.05.2022, yet during the interregnum arrived at a conclusion that the implementation of the of this Court would be neigh impossible and vide Government No. UDD269MNY2018 (Part-4) dated 23.02.2021 which was pursuant to the Cabinet decision taken on 18.02.2021 vide subject No.C.82/21 the State had dropped the proposal to widen the road and thereby had failed to comply with the s of this Court. 14. On present contempt petitions being filed in 2022 an attempt has been made by the authorities to project a picture as though all efforts were made to implement the s of the Court. Two stages in which there has been wilful disobedience of the s of this Court are: FIRST STAGE i. After the was passed on 21.11.2014 no steps were taken to implement the said in its letter and spirit which ought to have been at least till 2017 i.e., issuance of notification dated 05.04.2017 for carrying out widening of roads; ii. Though State Government issued on 17.07.2019 permitting BBMP to issue TDR to the concerned land owners, yet TDR was not issued despite all demands of BBMP were complied by land owners: 1308 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports iii. From the date of dated 21.11.2014 till an application namely IA No. 798276 of 2021 was filed for modification, the saga of pushing the file from table to table and keeping the same idle for a long period and conveniently ignoring the of this Court by not implementing the same in its true spirit had continued for years or atleast till 17.07.2019; SECOND STAGE iv. After the dated 17.05.2022 came to be passed rejecting the application for modification/ clarification yet the State and its authorities did not take steps to implement the s of this Court as expected of a prudent litigant i.e., by the State which should have acted as a model litigant. 15. In fact, this Court by dated 19.03.2024 with the hope that respondents would purge in the contempt by implementing the same in its letter & spirit had directed compliance of the dated 21.11.2014 and 17.05.2022. However, an additional condition was imposed or in other words s dated 21.11.2014 and 17.05.2022 was tweaked by this Court.
