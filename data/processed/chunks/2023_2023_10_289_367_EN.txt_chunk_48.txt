The Court further observed that, there existed no significant state interest to justify exemption of women from jury service. (d) In Hishon vs. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 104 S. Ct. 2229 (1984)the controversy was whether King & Spalding, the B law firm where Hishon was employed, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (for short, “CR Act, 1964”) by unfairly discriminating against Hishon on the basis of her sex by denying her admission to the partnership of the firm. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that Title VII of the CR Act, 1964 made C it illegal for an employer to discriminate against any employee on the basis of her sex. The Court observed that, the promise of equal consideration for partnership that went along with Hishon’s employment was contractual in nature and subject to the regulations of Title VII of the CR Act, 1964. The Court further observed that by preventing Hishon from obtaining partnership because of her D sex, the firm had discriminated against her and had breached the “terms, conditions or privileges of employment”. It was therefore held that the firm acted in direct violation of Title VII of the CR Act, 1964. (e) Another question before the Supreme Courtin United States E vs. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996)was whether the practice undertaken by the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) of offering education only to men and not women constituted a denial of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. In a 7:1 decision, the Court held that VMI’s male- F only admissions policy was unconstitutional. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was of the view that Virginia failed to show “an exceedingly persuasive justification” for VMI’s gender-biased admissions policy. The Court observed that the notion that admitting women would downgrade VMI’s stature and destroy the school’s adversity system, was hardly proved. The Court therefore G observed that, it violated the Fourteen Amendment’s equal protection clause. 61.
