[Paras 12 and 13][173-F-G; 176-E-F] Lohit Kaushal v. State of Haryana (2009) 17 SCC 106; Anil v. Administration of Daman & Diu (2006) 13 SCC 36 : [2006] 9 Suppl. SCR 466; Vishwanath Gupta v. State of Uttaranchal (2007) 11 SCC 633 : [2007] 4 E SCR 332; Vikram Singh v. Union of India (2015) 9 SCC 502 : [2015] 10 SCR 816 – relied on. 1.2 The Courts below, as is usual in kidnapping cases, have placed singular reliance on the testimony of PW-21 to prove the element of ‘threat to cause death or hurt’, or to determine whether F the appellants’ conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to death or hurt. The statement of PW-21 made to the police on 18.02.2000, i.e., two days after he had returned home from the captivity of appellants herein records that he was threatened at night by the appellants with a ‘revolver,’ G which was claimed to be possessed by them. The exact statement was, “One handkerchief and one black cloth were tied on the eyes and said to me they have revolver and they will kill him if [he] raises any voice.” However, the statement before the Trial Court dated 15.04.2002, nearly two years after the initial statement, includes a substantial detail that was omitted in the previous H 166 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A statement. After mentioning that the PW-21 was forcibly put inside the car and gagged, the statement reads, “The occupants threatened me with a knife and pistol and threatened me to kill.” Thus, three crucial changes may be noticed: first, a change in the exact timing of the threat; second, the specificity of the delivery of the threat to kill; and third, omission of the intent behind the B threat i.e. to prevent PW-21 from crying out. These details are crucial to proving the second ingredient of the charge under Section 364A and essential to bring home the guilt under this section namely, threat resulting in giving rise to a reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to death or hurt. It is C clear that this ingredient has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The Courts below did not thoroughly address this doubt before convicting the appellants. For proving the ingredient of threat, the intimidation of the child victim, for the purpose of making him silent, cannot be enough. If the sentence carrying a maximum sentence of death and a minimum sentence of life D sentence has such a low evidentiary threshold, the difference between punishments for kidnapping under 363, 364 and 364A shall become meaningless. [Para 15][179-F-H; 180-A-D] 2. This Court has wide power to alter the charge under Section 216 of the Cr.PC whilst not causing prejudice to the E accused. In the facts of the present case, the conviction of the appellants is unsustainable under Section 364A of the IPC. The conviction under Section 364A of the IPC is set aside. The s of the Trial Court and the High Court are modified to the above extent.
