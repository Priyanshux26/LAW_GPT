[2023] 8 S.C.R. 183 183 GMR WARORA ENERGY LIMITED A v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION (CERC) & ORS. (Civil Appeal No.11095 of 2018) B APRIL 20, 2023 [B. R. GAVAI AND VIKRAM NATH, JJ.] Electricity – Components to be considered as “Change in Law” events – Held: The term “Law” has been defined in the Power C Purchase Agreements – ‘Law’ would mean all laws including Electricity Laws in force in India and any statute, ordinance, regulations, s, Notification or code, rules, or any interpretation of any of them by an Indian Governmental Instrumentality and having force of law – It shall also include all rules, regulations, decisions and s of the CERC and the MERC – Thus, all such D additional charges which are payable on account of s, directions, Notifications, Regulations, etc., issued by the instrumentalities of the State after the cut-off date will have to be considered to be ‘Change in Law’ events – The Generators would be entitled to compensation on the restitutionary principle on such E changes occurring after the cut-off date – Revision of charges to be paid on Busy Season Surcharge, Development Surcharge and Port Congestion Charges from time to time by the ‘Railway Board’ would come within the ambit of ‘Change in Law’ – Notifications by which MoEF mandated power projects to use beneficiated coal with ash content lower than 34% would also amount to “Change in Law’ F – Further, change in NCDP would also amount to ‘Change in Law’ – With regard to forest tax, as on the cut-off date there was no Forest Tax applicable on coal mined and transported from South Eastern Coalfields Limited mines located in Forest area – For the first time, vide Notification of the Forest Department, Government G of Chhattisgarh a fee was levied – Said notification issued by the Forest Department of the Government of Chhattisgarh, which is an instrumentality of the State would also be a ‘Change in Law’ – No error in the finding of the APTEL in that regard – Also, ‘add on premium’ was required to be paid on account of cancellation of H 183 184 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A captive coal blocks and inordinate delay on account of Go-No-Go policy – As such, it cannot be said that the reasoning adopted by the APTEL is perverse and arbitrary – EFC imposed by CIL which is an instrumentality of the State, circular of CIL would also amount to ‘Change in Law’ – In the light of said findings, each of the appeals considered independently, dismissed – Electricity Act, 2003. B Electricity – Carrying cost – Grant of interest – Held: Once carrying cost has been granted, it cannot be urged that interest on carrying cost should be calculated on simple interest basis instead of compound interest basis – Grant of compound interest on carrying cost and that too from the date of the occurrence of the ‘Change in C Law’ event is based on sound logic – It aimed at restituting a party that is adversely affected by a ‘Change in Law’ event and restore it to its original economic position as if such a ‘Change in Law’ event had not taken place – In view of the consistent position of law and application of restitutionary principles and privity of contractual D obligations between the parties as contained in the Power Purchase Agreements, the view taken by the APTEL with regard to carrying cost warrants no interference – Electricity Act, 2003.
