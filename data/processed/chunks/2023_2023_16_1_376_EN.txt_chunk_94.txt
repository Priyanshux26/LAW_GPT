The state legislature can thereafter modify or repeal the law. In Clause 1 the expression “competent” is used to signify an empowerment; an entrustment of power. In Clause 2, the same expression is used to mean the constitutional capacity to make the law. 227. Article 356(1)(b) indicates that on a Proclamation being issued, the President may declare that the powers of the legislature of the state shall be exercisable by or under the authority of Parliament. Article 357 provides for what is subsumed, when by a declaration under Article 356, the powers of the legislature of the State are exercisable by or under the authority of Parliament. The text of the prefatory part of Article 357 is similar to the language of Article 356(1)(b). However, the prefatory part of article 357 refers to the entirety of Clause 1 of Article 356. The ambit of Article 356(1) (b) is clearly broader than the canvas of Article 357(1). Article 356(1)(b) would comprehend both law making and non-law making powers when it uses the expression “powers exercisable by the legislature of the state”. Clause (a) of Article 357(1) – and Clause (b) which refers to Clause (a) – on the other hand refer to the power of the legislature of the state to make laws. This is the legislative power referable to Articles 245 and 246. It would be diffi cult to read Article 357(1) as restricting the ambit of the conferment of power under Article 356(1)(b). The basic purpose of Article 357 is to ensure that while exercising the powers of the legislature of the State pursuant to a declaration under Article 356(1), Parliament, or as the case may be, the President are not impeded by an absence of competence which would have impeded the exercise of a similar power in the absence of a Proclamation under Article 356. The description in Article 357 of what could lie within the competence of Parliament or the President during a Proclamation which vests the powers of the State Legislature in Parliament cannot restrict the powers available under Article 356. Article 357 does not contain a non- obstante provision which overrides Article 356. Article 357 cannot be read to exclude everything apart from sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Clause 1 from the ambit of Article 356. To interpret Article 357(1) as a restriction on Article 356(1)(b) would be to read in a restriction which the plain terms IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 139 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] of the Constitution do not provide. To put it diff erently, acceptance of a contrary interpretation would require the court to read the expression “only” to precede the expression “competent” in the prefatory part of Article 357. This will amount to judicial rewriting of the text of the Constitution which is plainly impermissible. 228. A seven-Judge Bench of this Court in In re Presidential Poll203 held that the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly is not a ground for preventing the holding of the election on the expiry of the term of the President.
