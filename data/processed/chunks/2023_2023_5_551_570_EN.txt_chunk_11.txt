It was also held that the executing court was required to determine the question relating to when the appellants had objected to the execution of the decree as against those appellants who were not parties to the decree for specific performance. G 21. The decision in Brahmdeo Chaudhary (supra)cited by Mr. Chitambaresh, is also to the same effect. 13 (2020) 16 SCC 230 14 (1995) 1 SCC 6 15 (1995) 1 SCC 242 H 16 (1996) 3 SCC 154 JINI DHANRAJGIR & ANR. v. SHIBU MATHEW & ANR. ETC. 567 [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] 22. Considering the scheme of XXI Rules 97 to 106, this A Court in Silverline Forum Pvt. Ltd. v. Rajiv Trust & Anr.17 found it difficult to agree with the High Court that resistance or obstruction made by a third party to the decree put to execution cannot be gone into under XXI Rule 97. Referring to Rules 97 to 106, this Court further held that they were intended to deal with every sort of resistance or obstruction B raised by any person and that Rule 97(2) made it incumbent on the court to adjudicate upon such complaint in accordance with the procedure laid down. This Court also proceeded to observe: “It is clear that executing court can decide whether the resistor or obstructer is a person bound by the decree and he C refuses to vacate the property. That question also squarely falls within the adjudicatory process contemplated in 21, Rule 97(2) of the Code. The adjudication. mentioned therein need not necessarily involve a detailed enquiry or collection of evidence. Court can make the adjudication on admitted facts or even on the averments made by the resistor. D Of course, the Court can direct the parties to adduce evidence for such determination if the Court deems it necessary”. 23. The long line of precedents notwithstanding, it is indeed true that in terms of the ordainment of Rule 102 of XXI, Rules 98 and 100 thereof would not apply to resistance or obstruction in execution of E a decree for the possession of immovable property by a person to whom the -debtor has transferred the property after the institution of the suit in which the decree was passed. 24. The thrust of Mr. Divan’s argument has been that the Respondents are pendente lite transferees, the doctrine of lis pendens F applies, and in view of the clear terms of Rule 102, the objections were not maintainable; therefore, the Respondents are not entitled to the protection of having an adjudication of their claims in terms of Rule 98. 25. The argument, though attractive at first blush, pales into insignificance in view of the peculiar facts obtaining here. From the G factual narrative, it appears that the Suit instituted by Mrs. Cherian in 1987 was initially dismissed on 16th November 1989 and upon an appeal being preferred in 1991, the Suit was restored to the file of the trial court by the of the High Court dated 18th December 1998.
