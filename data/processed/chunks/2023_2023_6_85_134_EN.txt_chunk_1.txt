Therefore, in view of the enactment of IBC, it necessitated to exclude the applicability of Sections 326 and 327 of the Act, 2013 which cannot be said to be arbitrary. D [Para 6][111-E-F] 1.2. Sub-Section (7) of Section 327 shall be applicable in case of liquidation of a company under the IBC. In case of liquidation of a company under IBC, the provisions of Section 53 of the IBC and other provisions of the IBC shall be applicable as E the company is ed to be liquidated or wound up under the provisions of IBC. Therefore, merely because under the earlier regime and in case of winding up of a company under the Companies Act, 1956/2013, the dues of the workmen may have pari passu with that of the secured creditor, the petitioner cannot claim the same benefit in case of winding up/liquidation of the F company under IBC. The parties shall be governed by the provisions of the IBC in case of liquidation of a company under the provisions of the IBC. [Para 6.1][111-G-H; 112-A-B] 1.3. Section 53 of the IBC provides for distribution of the assets in case of liquidation of a company under IBC. As per G Section 53(1)(b) the workmen’s dues for the period of twenty- four months preceding the liquidation commencement date shall rank equally between the workmen and the secured creditor in the event such secured creditor has relinquished security in the H MOSER BAER KARAMCHARI UNION THR. PRESIDENT MAHESH 87 CHAND SHARMA v. UNION OF INDIA manner set out in Section 52. Therefore, workmen’s dues for the A period of twenty-four months preceding the liquidation commencement date shall have pari passu with the dues of secured creditor. At this stage, it is required to be noted that as per Section 36(4) of IBC, all sums due to any workman or employee from the provident fund, the pension fund and the gratuity fund shall not B be included in the liquidation estate assets and shall not be used for the recovery in the liquidation. Therefore, a conscious decision has been taken by the Parliament/Legislature in its wisdom to keep out of all sums due to any workman/employee from the provident fund, the pension fund and the gratuity fund from the liquidation estate assets [as per Section 36(4)] and that the C workmen’s dues for the period of twenty-four months preceding the liquidation commencement date shall rank equally between the workmen’s dues to the said extent and the dues to the secured creditor. Therefore, the same cannot be said to be arbitrary and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. [Para 6.2][112- D B-F] 1.4 As per the settled position of law, IBC is a complete Code and the object and purpose of IBC is altogether different than that of the Act, 1956/2013. The IBC is a new insolvency mechanism, therefore, the provisions under the IBC cannot be E compared with that of the earlier regime, namely, the Companies Act, 1956/2013. [Para 6.2][112-F] 1.5 The legislature has now removed clause (a) to Section 271 of the Companies Act, 2013, when a company is unable to pay the debts, and clause (d) to Section 271 of the Companies F Act, 2013, when a company is directed to be wound up under the Chapter XIX of the Companies Act, 2013.
