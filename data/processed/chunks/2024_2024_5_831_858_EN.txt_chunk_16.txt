The importance of the communication of public purpose as an ingredient of the notification for acquisition was reiterated by this Court in Munshi Singh v. Union of India (1973) 2 SCC 337 when acquisition proceedings were set aside since the public purpose was mentioned as “planned development of the area” which was observed to be wholly insufficient and conveyed no idea as to the specific purpose. Similarly, in Madhya Pradesh Housing Board v. Mohd. Shafi (1992) 2 SCC 168, wherein this Court quashed the acquisition proceedings on the ground that the public purpose was mentioned as “residential” which was too vague. 18 In State of U.P. v. Manohar (2005) 2 SCC 126, this Court held that payment of compensation is an integral part of the process of land acquisition. In M. Naga Venkata Lakshmi v. Visakhapatnam Municipal Corpn. (2007) 8 SCC 748, this Court held that wherever promised, compensation is ought to be paid. In NHAI v. P. Nagaraju (2022) 15 SCC 1, this Court held that compensation must be adequate and must be arrived at keeping in mind the market value of the acquired land. In Vidya Devi v. State of H.P. (2020) 2 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 853 Kolkata Municipal Corporation & Anr. v. Bimal Kumar Shah & Ors. 30.6. The Right to an efficient and expeditious process: (i) The acquisition process is traumatic for more than one reason. The administrative delays in identifying the land, conducting the enquiry and evaluating the objections, leading to a final declaration, consume time and energy. Further, passing of the award, payment of compensation and taking over the possession are equally time consuming. It is necessary for the administration to be efficient in concluding the process and within a reasonable time. This obligation must necessarily form part of Article 300A. (ii) Sections 5A(1), 6, 11A, and 34 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Sections 6(1A) and 9 of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952, Sections 4(2), 7(4), 7(5), 11(5), 14, 15(1), 16(1), 19(2), 25, 38(1), 60(4), 64 and 80 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 and Sections 3C(1), 3D(3) and 3E(1) of the National Highways Act, 1956, prescribe for statutory frameworks for the completion of individual steps in the process of acquisition of land within stipulated timelines. (iii) On multiple occasions, upon failure to adhere to the timelines specified in law, the courts have set aside the acquisition proceedings19. 30.7. The Right of conclusion: (i) Upon conclusion of process of acquisition and payment of compensation, the State takes SCC 569, this Court held that even though compensation is not expressly provided for under Article 300A of the Constitution, it can be inferred therein. In the American jurisprudence, payment of compensation has been made part of due process (See Sweet v. Rechel [159 US 380 (1895) : 40 L.Ed. 188], Delaware L. & W.R. Co. v. Morristown [276 US 182 (1928) : 72 L.Ed. 523] and United States v. Caltex (Philippines) [344 US 149 (1952) : 97 L.Ed.
