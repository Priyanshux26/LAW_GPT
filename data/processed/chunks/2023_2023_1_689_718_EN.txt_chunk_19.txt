It is of some significance to observe that when a separate charging section is introduced specifically, to assess the undisclosed income, C notwithstanding a provision in the nature of Section 4 already on the statute book, this move of the legislature has to be assigned some reason, otherwise, there was no necessity to make a provision in the form of Section 158-BA(2). It could only be that for assessing undisclosed income, the charging provision is Section D 158-BA(2) alone.” 10.1 Thus, with respect to assessment of undisclosed income for the block period including the filing of the return etc., the normal assessment proceedings including under Section 140 of the Income Tax Act shall not be applicable. Therefore, the submission on behalf of the E assessee that interest under Section 158BFA for the period prior to 01.06.1999 in view of insertion of the words “Section 158BC” in Section 140A w.e.f. 01.06.1999, shall not be chargeable, cannot be accepted. At this stage, it is required to be noted that it is the case on behalf of the assessee that the interest only follows the principal and in this case the F principal being the tax payable, there was no liability to pay the tax along with the return prior to 01.06.1999 which came to be introduced by insertion of the words “Section 158BC” in Section 140A and therefore the liability to pay interest cannot arise if there was no liability to pay the tax itself along with the return at the relevant time, has no substance. At this stage, it requires to be noted that neither Section 158BC nor Section G 158BFA required the assessee to pay tax along with the return. Liability to deposit the tax along with return arises only under Section 140A. However, at the relevant point of time Section 140A did not apply to Section 158BC and hence there was no liability to deposit tax along with the return. The said lacunae was noticed by the Parliament and by the H 714 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A Finance Act, 1999, the words “Section 158BC” have been inserted in Section 140A w.e.f. 01.06.1999. That does not mean that interest under Section 158BFA would not be leviable in case of late filing of return. The return under Section 158BC was required to be filed as per Chapter XIV-B and on the delay in filing the return, there shall be liability to pay interest leviable under Section 158BFA(1). B 10.2 At this stage, the Notes on Clauses and the memorandum explaining the said provision which is reported in (1999) 236 ITR (St) 141 and 187 are required to be considered and reproduced, which read as under: C “Clause 63 seeks to amend section 140A of the Income Tax Act relating to self-assessment. Under the existing provisions, if any tax is payable on the basis of any return required to be furnished under section 139 of section 142 or section 148, the assessee shall be liable D to pay such tax along with interest payable under the Act before furnishing the return and the return shall be accompanied by proof of payment of such tax and interest.
