It is submitted that even in the event, this Court permits L-5 bidder to supply 100 MW power and 160 MW power for medium term in pursuance to the passed by this Court on 26th September 2023, still the total would not be beyond 766 MW. Still the balance of 140 MW power would remain. 35. Dr. Singhvi submits insofar as contention of the appellants with regard to delay and laches is concerned, the same is without substance. He submits that only after the respondent No.1 came to know about the incapacity of L-3, L-4 and L-6 bidders to honour their offered capacity, the occasion to revalidate the claim of the respondent No.1 arose. The learned Senior Counsel, relying on clause 3.5.6 of the RFP, submits that the selection process shall continue till the requisitioned capacity has been achieved through the summation of the quantum offered by the “successful bidders” or when the balance of the requisitioned capacity is less than the minimum bid capacity. It is submitted that since there is still a gap of 140 MW, to comply with this Court’s dated 25th April 2018, the appellants are bound to enter into PPAs with the qualified bidders until the entire requisitioned capacity of 906 MW is met. 36. Dr. Singhvi relied on the following chart to show that the prices discovered in all medium and long term bids are much higher than the levelized price quoted by the respondent No.1-MB Power. 934 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “Prices discovered in all medium and long term bids since 2022 Procurer State 1st Year Levelized PPA Duration Quoted Tariff for 25 Tariff years Adani Mumbai– 2022 5.98 8.78 2.1 years Uttarakhand–2023 5.41 7.93 1.5 years Noida Power – 2022 5.15 7.46 3 years Mundra SEZ– 2023 5.00 6.69 15 years Haryana – 2022 5.70 to 5.75 8.36 3 years J & K – 2023 6.05 8.22 5 years Haryana – 2023 6.05 8.22 5 years NDMC – 2023 6.05 8.22 5 years Madhya Pradesh–2023 6.05 8.22 5 years Haryana – 2023 5.79 8.49 5 years Gujarat – 2023 5.18 to 5.69 6.81 15 years Uttarakhand–2023 7.97 11.72 3.5 years Noida Power – 2023 6.30 9.18 3 years” 37. Dr. Singhvi, therefore, submits that, if the directions as issued by the High Court are maintained, it will be in the interests of the consumers, who will be getting the electricity at lesser prices than what has recently been emerged as a levelized price in the bidding process. He submits that this is specifically so when indisputably even according to the appellants they are in dire need of power. Dr. Singhvi, therefore, prays for dismissal of the present appeals. 38. Shri C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned Senior Counsel also addressed similar arguments and prayed for dismissal of the present appeals. CONSIDERATIONS 39. For considering the rival submissions, it will be necessary to refer to some of the provisions of the Electricity Act, which are as under: “63. Determination of tariff by bidding process.
