The appellant relied on Allahabad High Court’s decision dated 8th September 2010, in the case of M/s. Pepsico India Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. & Anr v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors1. By the impugned , the High Court dismissed the petition filed by the appellant. Incidentally, the decision in the 1 2010 SCC OnLine All 1708 748 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports case of Pepsico India1 is the subject matter of challenge by the State of Uttar Pradesh in Criminal Appeal No. 476-478 of 2012. In this case, FIR was registered against the respondent on 11th August 2010, alleging the commission of offences under Sections 272 and 273 of the IPC. The allegation was of adulteration in the cold drinks manufactured by the respondent. The view taken in the case of Pepsico India1 was that, from 29th July 2010, when the FSSA came into force, the provisions thereof would have an overriding effect over the food-related laws, including Sections 272 and 273 of the IPC. Further, it was held that the police have no authority or jurisdiction to investigate a case under the FSSA. 4. Criminal Appeal No. 479 of 2012 takes an exception to the dated 15th September 2010, wherein the High Court declined to quash an offence punishable under Sections 272 and 273 of the IPC. In Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 1379 of 2011, the challenge is to the dated 3rd August 2010 of the Allahabad High Court by which a petition under Section 482 of CrPC filed by the appellant for quashing the FIR alleging commission of offences under Section 272 and 273 of the IPC was dismissed. 5. In Short, the controversy is whether the view taken in the case of Pepsico India1, which is the subject matter of challenge in Criminal Appeal No. 476-478 of 2012, is correct. In the said decision, it was held that after coming into force of the FSSA with effect from 29th July 2010, it would have an overriding effect on other food-related laws, including the PFA. Therefore, the High Court held that invocation of Sections 272 and 273 of the IPC concerning food adulteration pursuant to a Government dated 11th May 2010 was bad in law. SUBMISSIONS 6.
