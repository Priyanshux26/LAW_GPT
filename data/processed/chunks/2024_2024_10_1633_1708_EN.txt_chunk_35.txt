Digital Supreme Court Reports construction of implied repeal is whether the new or subsequent law is inconsistent with or repugnant to the old law. The inconsistency or repugnancy should clearly and manifestly reveal an intention to repeal the existing laws.104 The inconsistency or repugnancy must be such that the two statutes cannot be reconciled on reasonable construction or hypothesis. To determine whether a later statute repeals by implication an earlier statute, it is necessary to examine the scope and object of the two enactments by comparison of their provisions.105 Implied repeal should be avoided, if possible, where both the statutes can stand together.106 44. We now proceed to analyse the issues given the broad legislative and judicial background discussed above. E. Reading TOLA into the Income Tax Act i. First proviso to Section 149(1) of the new regime 45. The first proviso to Section 149(1)(b) provides thus: “149. (1) No notice under section 148 shall be issued for the relevant assessment year, - (a) If three years have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year, unless the case falls under clause (b); (b) If three years, but not more than ten years, have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year unless the Assessing Officer has in possession of books of account or other documents or evidence which reveal that the income chargeable to tax, represented in the form of asset, which has escaped assessment amounts to or is likely to amount to fifty lakh rupees or more for that year: Provided that no notice under section 148 shall be issued at any time in a case for the relevant assessment year beginning on or before 1st day of April 2021, if such notice could not have been issued at that time 104 Municipal Council Palai v. T J Joseph, 1963 SCC OnLine SC 55 [10] 105 State of M P v. Kedia Leather & Liquor Ltd. (2003) 7 SCC 389 [15] 106 Harshad S Mehta v. State of Maharashtra (2001) 8 SCC 257 [31] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1677 Union of India & Ors. v. Rajeev Bansal on account of being immediately beyond the time limit specified under the provisions of clause (b) of sub- section (1) of this section, as they stood immediately before the commencement of the Finance Act, 2021:” (emphasis supplied) 46. The ingredients of the proviso could be broken down for analysis as follows: (i) no notice under Section 148 of the new regime can be issued at any time for an assessment year beginning on or before 1 April 2021; (ii) if it is barred at the time when the notice is sought to be issued because of the “time limits specified under the provisions of” 149(1)(b) of the old regime. Thus, a notice could be issued under Section 148 of the new regime for assessment year 2021-2022 and before only if the timelimit for issuance of such notice continued to exist under Section 149(1)(b) of the old regime. 47. In CTO v. Biswanath Jhunjhunwalla,107 the Bengal Sales Tax Rules 1941 empowered the Commissioner to revise any assessment within four years from the date of assessment.
