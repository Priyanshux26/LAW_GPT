9 Whether the entire statement recorded under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C. can be exhibited, and canbe read in evidence is not the subject matter of the present appeal and we make no comments and observations on this aspect. 10 The exact date of filing the application is not available on record. 11 For short, ‘the application’. H 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A and the site maps (Exhibits P-13 and P-14), were drawn. It is alleged that the victim (PW-5) was tutored based on the videography of the scene of the crime shown to the victim a day prior to the preparation of the spot panchnama/Mauka Naksha and site maps on 22.08.2013. In this context, the application records that Ajay Pal Lamba, who was the then Deputy Commissioner of Police (West), Jodhpur, Rajasthan, in the B Book, has disclosed having recorded a video of the scene of the crime on his mobile phone on his first visit to the ‘Kutyia’ on 21.08.2013, which is a day prior to the drawing of the site maps (Exhibits P-13 and P-14) on 22.08.2013. The assertion in the application is that the site maps (Exhibits P-13 and P-14) are false and ought to be discarded. It is alleged C that there is a discrepancy between video recording (Article-15) and statement of the victim (PW-5) recorded under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C. dated 21.08.2013 (Exhibit D-2). If the description of the ‘Kutiya’, as given by the victim (PW-5), which, as per prosecution’s case, was made in her statement under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C. for the first time on 21.08.2013 (Exhibit D-2), is falsified and rejected, the prosecution’s case D wouldnot be able to link the victim (PW-5)’s presence with the respondent – Asharam @ Ashumal at the scene of the crime on 15.08.2013, the date when the offences were allegedly committed. 8. The impugned refers to quotes from a portion of the Book, wherein Ajay Pal Lamba has stated that on learning about the E offence, he had swung into action and had sent a police team to scan and examine the location. Ajay Pal Lamba had asked Sub-Inspector Madan Beniwal to seal and secure the entire campus until the investigation was completed. The impugned dated 10.02.2022, at the sametime, quotes Ajay Pal Lamba’s assertion in the Book – “In any case, one would not be very wrong to assume that not much of the F forensic evidence would be found at the [scene of the crime] because of...the sheer delay in filing the FIR...”, as the offence was stated to have occurred on 15.08.2013, while the F.I.R. No. 122 of 2013 (Exhibit P-106) was registered on 21.08.2013. Nevertheless, the application under Section 391 of the Cr.P.C. for summoning and recording evidence of G Ajay Pal Lamba has been allowed primarily relying on the following statement by Ajay Pal Lamba in the Book: “….. While I was there, I thought it would be prudent to film a video of the place on my mobile phone, should I need to refer to it at some point during the course of the investigation.
