[Paras 16,17, 48, 49, 50] Principle/Doctrine – uberrimae fidei – Insurance – Reciprocal duties: 726 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: Just as the insured has a duty to disclose all material facts, the insurer must also inform the insured about the terms and conditions of the policy that is going to be issued to him and must strictly conform to the statements in the proposal form or prospectus, or those made through his agents – Thus, the principle of utmost good faith imposes meaningful reciprocal duties owed by the insured to the insurer and vice versa. [Para 22] Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Protection of Policyholders’ Interests) Regulations, 2002 – A fact, whether material or not – Propositions: Held: Whether a fact is material will depend on the circumstances, as proved by evidence, of the particular case – It is for the court to rule as a matter of law, whether, a particular fact is capable of being material and to give directions as to the test to be applied – Rules of universal application are not therefore to be expected, but the propositions as set out are well established: (a) Any fact is material which leads to the inference, in the circumstances of the particular case, that the subject matter of insurance is not an ordinary risk, but is exceptionally liable to be affected by the peril insured against – This is referred to as the “physical hazard”; (b) Any fact is material which leads to the inference that the particular proposer is a person, or one of a class of persons, whose proposal for insurance ought to be subjected at all or accepted at a normal rate – This is usually referred to as the “moral hazard”; (c) The materiality of a particular fact is determined by the circumstances of each case and is a question of fact. [Para 26] Evidence Act, 1872 – Burden of proof and onus of proof – Consumer Fora: Held: Though the proceedings before the Consumer Fora are in the nature of a summary proceeding – Yet the elementary principles of burden of proof and onus of proof would apply – Section 101 of the Evidence Act states that whoever desires any Court to give as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist – When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person – Section 102 of the Evidence Act provides a test regarding on whom the burden of proof would lie, namely, that the burden lies [2024] 4 S.C.R. 727 Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali India Life Insurance Company Limited & another on the person who would fail if no evidence were given on either side – There are however exceptions to the general rule as to the burden of proof as enunciated in Sections 101 and 102 of the Evidence Act, 1872, i.e., in the context of the burden of adducing evidence: (i) when a rebuttable presumption of law exists in favour of a party, the onus is on the other side to rebut it; (ii) when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving it is on him (Section 106) – In some cases, the burden of proof is cast by statute on particular parties (Sections 103 and 105).
