The implementation of the 2013 Act enacted duly and empowering a downtrodden section of the society cannot be left unrealised, and especially not due to executive inaction. State Monitoring Committees 75. The State Monitoring Committees, like the CMCs, have a number of ex offi cio members such as the Chief Minister or a Minister nominated by him, the Minister-in-charge of the Scheduled Castes Welfare, representatives of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Safai Karamcharis, etc. as mandated by Section 26 of the 2013 Act. Similarly, the functions of the State Monitoring Committee are also broad under Section 27. However, it has been brought to the notice of this Court that the State Monitoring Committees are inactive which is in direct contravention of the statutory mandate under Section 26 of the 2013 Act.44 76. The data compiled by the Union and presented by the Amicus Curiae in tabular form evidences that the Committees either do not exist or have not met in the recent past. There is no material on record to show that steps have been taken at any stage to constitute the Committees and ensure that they are working. 44 See the extracted table for easy reference 112 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R.
