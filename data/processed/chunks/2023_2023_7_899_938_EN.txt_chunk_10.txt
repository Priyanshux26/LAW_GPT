It is submitted that prior to the new scheme, when a search gets initiated or a requisition happens, the normal assessment/reassessment was allowed to be carried on without any interference and a block assessment of undisclosed income F was allowed to be made independently. However, the new scheme brought w.e.f. 01.06.2003 has dismantled this structure and Section 153A conceives the following sequence: a. The jurisdictional exercise of power to initiate proceedings u/s 153A would commence only upon initiation of a search G u/s 132 or a requisition u/s 132A and not before that. b. Once a search gets initiated or a requisition is made, the assessment process under every other provision of the Income Tax Act would abate. H 914 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A c. This is clear by virtue of the expression employed in Section 153A(1) “Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 139, 147, 148, 149, 151 and 153.” Being a non-obstinate provision, Section 153A overrides all these provisions. It is submitted that to what extent does the override operate is B also brought clearly by Section 153A in the following manner: I. 153A(1)(b) allows assessment and reassessment of total income of Six assessment years immediately preceding the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which such a search is conducted or requisition is made C and for the assessment year/years. II. Parliament has chosen the expressions “asses” or “reassess” the total income. III. It is the total income and not the undisclosed income that requires to be assessed u/s 153A. The expression D “undisclosed income” which was defined under erstwhile scheme Section 158B(b) has not found a reference or mention under the new scheme. IV. Likewise, each year in the six years in question needs to be assessed independently and not as a block which E again was defined under the erstwhile scheme u/s 158B(a), which is conspicuous by its absence under the new scheme. V. Therefore, twin conditions need to be satisfied under Section 153A(1)- F A. Assessments have to be completed year wise and not for block period and B. Assessments have to be made for the total income and not just for the undisclosed income. G (vii) It is submitted that once this is evident and clear, the scope of interpretation of the second proviso to section 153A(1) read with Section 153A(2) becomes clear and unambiguous. It is submitted that as per the scheme of Section 153A of the Act, 1961, two parallel assessments have to be avoided. Therefore, any assessment under Section 143, 144 and 147 pending on the date H PRINCIPAL COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, CENTRAL-3 915 v. ABHISAR BUILDWELL P. LTD. [M. R. SHAH, J.] of initiation of search u/s 132 or making of requestion u/s 132A A has to abate, and the same needs to be subsumed into Section 153A(1). The second proviso using the expression “shall abate” should be read with the expressions “assessment” or “reassessment” employed in the very same proviso, i.e., it must be read with the expression employed in Section 153A(1)(b) B “assess or reassess the total Income” and finally with the expression “notwithstanding” appearing as the opening phrase u/ s 153A(1) of the Act.
