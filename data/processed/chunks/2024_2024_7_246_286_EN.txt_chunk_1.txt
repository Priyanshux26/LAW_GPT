[Para 72.2] Cinematograph Act, 1952 – Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 – Cinematograph (Certification) Rules 1983 – Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 2024 – Inclusion of subject matter experts to the Board and advisory panels: Held: On inclusion of subject matter experts to the Board and advisory panels, this Court believes that the field is sufficiently occupied by the Cinematograph Act and the certification Rules of 1983 and 2024 does not merit interference – Under the 1983 Rules, the Board may take steps to assess public reactions to films – The Examining Committee is supposed to include women as its members – The 1983 Rules and the 2024 Rules envisage consultation with a subject matter expert: the Examining Committee’s final report is forwarded to the Chairperson in 10 days, unless the Committee feels that expert opinion is necessary – In that case, it may submit a provisional report and seek expert opinion before submitting the final report – The 2024 Certification Rules go a step further and provide that a Regional Officer may invite subject matter experts for the examination of the film by the Examination Committee or Revising Committee. [Para 72.3] Cinematograph Act, 1952 – Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 – Cinematograph (Certification) Rules 1983 – Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 2024 – Disparaging portrayal of person with disabilities: 248 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: The Board must decide whether a disparaging portrayal stood redeemed by the overall message or not – No doubt this entails a complex balancing of interests – It would be ideal if the statutory bodies included subject matter experts – The 2024 Rules are a welcome acknowledgment of this principle and consultations with subject matter experts on disability would certainly better inform the perspective of the Board – The policy underlying the Act and the Rules already accounts for expert consultation – This Court cannot interfere merely because it could be better or that a better alternative is available, when the legality of such policy is not in question. [Para 72.5] Cinematograph Act, 1952 – Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 – Cinematograph (Certification) Rules 1983 – Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 2024 – The appellant has sought formulation of guidelines to restrict content that contravenes the Constitution and the RPwD Act 2016: Held: The guidelines under the Act are quite extensive and cover the field – Such directions are issued to fill legislative gaps – If allowed, such guidelines would be akin to reading the provisions of one statute that is, the RPwD Act 2016 into another statute, that is the Cinematograph Act, even though the latter does not suffer from a vacuum on the issue, and the statutory expert body is presumed to have account for the effect of the former anyway – Courts cannot trench into policy-making. [Para 72.6] Constitution of India – Art. 19 – Cinematograph Act, 1952 – Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 – Cinematograph (Certification) Rules 1983 – Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 2024 – Provision of a framework of the portrayal of persons with disabilities in visual media that aligns with the anti-discrimination and dignity affirming objectives of the Constitution as well as the RPwD Act – The framework is laid down is in line with findings in Vikash Kumar case where it was emphasised that fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution apply with equal rigour to persons with disabilities: Held: The representation of persons with disabilities must regard the objective social context of their representation and not marginalise persons with disability: (i) Words cultivate institutional discrimination – Terms such as “cripple” and “spastic” have come to acquire devalued meanings in societal perceptions about persons [2024] 7 S.C.R.
