Patil, Sr. Adv., Anirudh Sanganeria, Jyotirmoy Chatterjee, Advs. for the Respondent. / of the Supreme Court R. Mahadevan, J. 1. At the outset, it would be apposite to point out the observation of this Court in Swatantar Singh v. State of Haryana1 (SCC p. 17, para 6), which reads as under: “6….. Corruption is corroding, like cancerous lymph nodes, the vital veins of the body politic, social fabric of efficiency in the public service and demoralizing the honest officers. The efficiency in public service would improve only when the public servant devotes his sincere attention and does the duty diligently, truthfully, honestly and devotes himself assiduously to the performance of the duties of his post. The reputation of being corrupt would gather thick and unchaseable clouds around the conduct of the officer and gain notoriety much faster than the smoke.” 2.
