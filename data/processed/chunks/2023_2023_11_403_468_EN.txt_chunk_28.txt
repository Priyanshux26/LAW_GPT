440 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. Issue (A): - Relevance and admissibility of the FIR: 62. According to the general procedure, facts need to be proved by adducing evidence in the Court of law, and the evidence must be produced in accordance with the procedure mentioned in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The doctrine of judicial notice, as provided under Section 56, is an exception to this rule. 63. Section 56 of the Evidence Act says that “No fact of which the Court will take judicial notice need to be proved.” Section 57 of the Evidence Act goes one step further by providing that the Court has no other option but to take judicial notice of the facts mentioned in the list given in the Section as it uses the word “shall” and not “may”. Section 58 of the Evidence Act says that if the parties or their agents have agreed to admit a fact during the court proceeding or in writing before the hearing, then such fact need not be proved unless the Court believes that it needs to be proved. The aforementioned three Sections i.e. 56 to 58 of the Evidence Act are reproduced hereunder: “56.Fact judicially noticeable need not be proved.––No fact of which the Court will take judicial notice need be proved. 57.
