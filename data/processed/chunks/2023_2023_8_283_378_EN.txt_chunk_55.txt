On the basis of the liberty so granted, the State again filed an appeal in OSA SR No.3526 of 2000 against the preliminary decree. But the same was dismissed by the G Division Bench of the High Court on 07.02.2001. The Special Leave Petition arising out of the same in SLP (C) Nos.10622-23 of 2001 was dismissed by this Court on 16.07.2001. Therefore, it is contended by Shri V.V.S. Rao, learned senior counsel that a preliminary decree which had attained finality, cannot be challenged subsequently, as held by this H 364 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A Court in Venkata Reddy vs. Pethi Reddy18. The learned senior counsel also drew our attention to the observation made in Narayan Sarma (supra) that no appeal having been made against the preliminary decree, it had attained finality. 189. But as we have pointed out earlier, the and B preliminary decree dated 28.06.1963 and whatever happened subsequent thereto, were not in accordance with, (i) the procedure to be followed in a partition suit; and (ii) the scope of enquiry in a suit for partition. 190. A careful look at the way in which the proceedings in CS No.14 of 1958 progressed would show that the High Court followed a C separate Code for itself and not the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. 191. It must be remembered that XX Rule 18 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, lays down a procedure to be adopted by a Court while passing a decree in a suit for partition. There are two sub- rules to Rule 18 of XX. As per the first sub-rule, the Court passing a decree for partition may direct the partition or separation to be made D by the Collector or any gazetted subordinate deputed by him, if the decree relates to an estate assessed to the payment of revenue to the Government. This shall be done, after first declaring the rights of several parties interested in the property. Under the second sub-rule, the Court may, if it thinks that the partition and separation cannot be conveniently E made without further enquiry, pass a preliminary decree declaring the rights of several parties and giving such further directions as may be required, if the decree relates to any other immovable property not covered by sub-rule (1). 192. Obviously, the preliminary decree passed on 28-06-1963 in F CS No.14 of 1958 did not belong to the category indicated in XX Rule 18 (1). It belonged to the category mentioned in XX Rule 18 (2). 193. As to what should be done in such cases, is provided in XXVI Rule 13 of the Code. 26 Rule 13 provides that where a G preliminary decree for partition has been passed, in any case not covered by Section 54 {and XX Rule 18 (1)}, the Court should issue Commission to such a person as it thinks fit, to make partition and separation according to the rights as declared in such a decree.
