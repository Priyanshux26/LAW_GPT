41. In 2021, the Green Grids Initiative37 was launched in partnership with OSOWOG during the COP26 World Leaders’ Summit. The UK and India jointly adopted the One Sun Declaration which was endorsed by 92 countries.38 This represented a flagship area for climate collaboration and established the partnership between the two initiatives to tackle arguably the greatest global challenge to a clean powered future: how to build and operate electricity grids capable of absorbing ever greater shares of renewable energy while meeting growing power demands sustainably, securely, reliably, and affordably. 42. It is imperative for India to not only find alternatives to coal-based fuels but also secure its energy demands in a sustainable manner. India urgently needs to shift to solar power due to three impending issues.39 Firstly, India is likely to account for 25% of global energy demand growth over the next two decades, necessitating a move towards solar for enhanced energy security and self-sufficiency while mitigating environmental impacts. Failure to do so may increase dependence on coal and oil, leading to economic and environmental costs. Secondly, rampant air pollution emphasizes the need for cleaner energy sources like solar to combat pollution caused by fossil fuels. Lastly, declining groundwater levels and decreasing annual rainfall underscore the importance of diversifying energy sources. Solar power, unlike coal, does not strain groundwater supplies. The extensive use of solar power plants is a crucial step towards cleaner, cheaper, and sustainable energy. 43. The geographical landscape of Gujarat and Rajasthan, characterized by vast expanses of arid desert terrain and an abundance of sunlight, positions these regions as prime areas for solar power generation. 37 “GGI” 38 Ministry of New Renewable Energy, Green Grids Initiative-One Sun One World One Grid Northwest Europe Cooperative Event, (2022) <https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1763712> 39 See Invest India, ‘One Sun, One World, One Grid: Empowering Sustainability’, 10 January 2024. <https://www.investindia.gov.in/team-india-blogs/one-sun-one-world-one-grid-empowering- sustainability> 1346 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The arid climate of these desert regions ensures minimal cloud cover and precipitation, resulting in uninterrupted exposure to sunlight for prolonged durations throughout the year. The consistent and intense sunlight creates ideal conditions for photovoltaic (PV) solar panels to efficiently convert solar radiation into electricity. Additionally, the relatively flat topography of these areas facilitates the installation and operation of large-scale solar energy projects, further enhancing their suitability for solar power generation. By harnessing this natural advantage, India can significantly reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and transition towards cleaner energy sources. Solar power not only meets the country’s growing energy demands but also helps mitigate the adverse effects of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. IV. Climate change litigation in other jurisdictions 44. Climate change litigation serves as a pivotal tool in advancing rights- based energy transitions and promoting energy justice, intertwined with human rights principles.40 Article 3(1) of the UNFCCC underscores the imperative for parties to safeguard the climate system for the well-being of present and future generations, grounded in equity and is reflective of their differentiated responsibilities and capabilities. This obligation places a particular onus on developed countries to take the lead in addressing climate change and its adverse impacts.
