The complaint was about the appellant submitting the additional performance security beyond the two days stipulated as per Clause 2.22.0 (ix). This was the only grievance in the complaint of the fi rst respondent herein. On 19.04.2021, the Executive Engineer, in his letter to the Superintending Engineer, mentioned that 13.03.2021 was a Saturday and 14.03.2021 was a Sunday and also confi rmed that on 15.03.2021 since all the nationalized banks were non-operational due to strike, the appellant had made a request to him to extend the time till 17.03.2021. He further stated that since 15.03.2021 and 16.03.2021 were the days when banks were non-operational due to strike, and since the appellant deposited the additional performance security on 17.03.2021, the deposit seems to be proper and a request was made to accept the tender of the appellant. Not only this, the Branch Manager of the Appellant’s Bank, in his letter of 11.05.2021 also does not deny that there was a strike of bank employees on 15.03.2021 and 16.03.2021. 19. This is a case where the appellant has complied with the condition of furnishing the additional performance security at the earliest possible time, that it could possibly comply. That no one can be compelled to perform an impossible task - Lex non cogit ad impossibilia- is a well-accepted legal principle. 20. This Court in Raj Kumar Dey and Others vs. Tarapada Dey and Others, (1987) 4 SCC 398, while quoting, approving and applying the maxim to the facts of that case, had the following to say: “6. … The other maxim is lex non cogit ad impossibilia (Broom’s Legal Maxims – page 162) – The law does not compel a man to do that which he cannot possibly perform. The law itself and the administration of it, said Sir W. Scott, with reference to an alleged infraction of the revenue laws, must yield to that to which everything must bend, to necessity; the law, in its most positive and peremptory injunctions, is understood to disclaim, as it does in its general aphorisms, all intention of compelling impossibilities, and the administration of laws must adopt that general exception in the consideration of all particular cases.” (emphasis supplied) M/S OM GURUSAI CONSTRUCTION COMPANY v. 387 M/S V.N. REDDY & ORS. [K. V. VISWANATHAN, J.] 21. Applying the same maxim and highlighting its principle, this Court in HUDA and Another vs. Dr. Babeswar Kanharand Another (2005) 1 SCC 191 stated that every consideration of justice and expediency would require that the accepted principle which underlies Section 10 of the General Clauses Act should be applied in cases where it does not otherwise in terms apply [Para 5]. 22. Closer to the facts of the present case is the in Rosali V. vs. TAICO Bank and Others (2009) 17 SCC 690. In that case, an auction was held after 4.00 p.m. when the banks were closed. XXI Rule 84 of the Code of Civil Procedure mandates that “on every sale of immovable property the person declared to be the purchaser shall pay immediately after such declaration a deposit of twenty-fi ve per cent on the amount of his purchase-money to the offi cer or other person conducting the sale, and in default of such deposit, the property shall forthwith be re-sold”.
