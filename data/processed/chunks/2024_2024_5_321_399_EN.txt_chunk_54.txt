141. Thus, in view of our aforesaid discussion, we deem it fit to exclude the period commencing from the date when FCIL was declared to be a sick company under the 1985 Act going up to the date when it was discharged by the BIFR and declared to be no longer a sick industrial company from the purview of the applicability of the interest provision under the 1993 Act. Thus, while the applicability of the 1993 Act to the dues of the original plaintiff is not disputed, such interest shall not be calculated for the period between 06.11.1992 and 27.06.2013. E. CONCLUSION 142. The net effect of the aforesaid discussion and findings is as follows: I. The suit instituted by the original plaintiff before the trial court was not hit by the embargo envisaged under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. Thus, the decree awarded in favour of the original plaintiff by the trial court and modified by the High Court, cannot be said to be coram non-judice. II. The High Court committed no error in awarding 24% interest to the original plaintiff on its dues as per the provisions of the 1993 Act. However, the period during which the defendant company was a sick company as per the 1985 Act should be excluded for the purposes of calculation of interest. 143. As a result, the impugned and of the High Court is upheld subject to the modification of the period for which interest [2024] 5 S.C.R. 399 Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v. M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited may be granted as discussed aforesaid. To clarify, the interest will be calculated at 24% p.a. with monthly compounding. 144. The appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid terms. The final amount that may be determined in accordance with the final decree shall be paid to the original plaintiff within a period of 4 weeks from today, failing which interest at the rate of 36% p.a. with monthly compounding shall accrue. 145. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. 146. Parties to bear their own costs. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeals disposed of.
