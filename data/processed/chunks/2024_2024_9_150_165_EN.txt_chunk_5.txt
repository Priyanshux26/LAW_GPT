As regards the Chief Justice of the High Court individually taking a decision and addressing the letter to the Chief Justice of India, it was argued by Dr. Muralidhar that the resolution of the Supreme Court Collegium (4.01.2024) did not specify that the reconsideration of the petitioners’ names was to be in consultation with the other members of the High Court Collegium. Therefore, the High Court Chief Justice according to the learned counsel, could have made the reconsideration all by himself. 1 [2009] 10 SCR 921 : (2009) 8 SCC 273 2 [2013] 1 SCR 711 : (2013) 3 SCC 99 3 [2023] 1 SCR 463 : (2023) 5 SCC 661 4 [1993] Supp. 2 SCR 659 : (1993) 4 SCC 441 (Para 482) 5 Para 39-41, 43-44 and 71, 74 6 [2013] 1 SCR 711 : (2013) 3 SCC 99 (Para 17-20) 7 [2014] 4 SCR 77 : (2014) 11 SCC 547 (Para 25-26) 8 [2017] 11 SCR 154 : (2018) 12 SCC 377 (Para 17) 9 [2023] 1 SCR 463 : (2023) 5 SCC 661 (Para 10) 158 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports ISSUES 10. Going by the above submissions, the following questions arise for our consideration: A) Whether the writ petition is maintainable? B) Whether elevation for judgeship in the High Court has to be considered collectively by the High Court Collegium or whether the Chief Justice acting individually can reconsider the same? Issue A 11. At the outset, it is apposite to address the issue of maintainability of the writ petition and the limited scope of judicial review in such matters. This aspect was addressed by a nine-judge bench of this Court in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association. v. Union of India10 (for short “Second Judges case”). It was observed therein that the scope of judicial review in appointment of judges is limited as it introduces the ‘judicial element’ in the process and further judicial review is not warranted apart from some exceptions such as want of consultation amongst the named constitutional functionaries. In this regard, the following passage from the Second Judges case (supra) bears consideration: “482. This is also in accord with the public interest of excluding these appointments and transfers from litigative debate, to avoid any erosion in the credibility of the decisions, and to ensure a free and frank expression of honest opinion by all the constitutional functionaries, which is essential for effective consultation and for taking the right decision. The growing tendency of needless intrusion by strangers and busybodies in the functioning of the judiciary under the garb of public interest litigation, in spite of the caution in S.P. Gupta [1981 Supp SCC : (1982) 2 SCR 365] while expanding the concept of locus standi, was adverted to recently by a Constitution Bench in Krishna Swami v. Union of India [(1992) 4 SCC 605]. It is, therefore, necessary to spell out clearly the limited scope of judicial review in such matters, to avoid similar situations 10 [1993] Supp. 2 SCR 659 : (1993) 4 SCC 441 [2024] 9 S.C.R.
