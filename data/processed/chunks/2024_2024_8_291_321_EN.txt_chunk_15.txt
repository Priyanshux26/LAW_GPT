46 (2021) 19 SCC 214 310 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 9.1 In Fuerst Day Lawson v. Jindal Exports Ltd,47 the High Court relied on Forasol (supra) and analogised that the date on which the objections to the enforcement of the award are finally rejected and the foreign award becomes enforceable would be the date that it is deemed to be a decree under Section 49. Hence, this would be the relevant conversion date. 9.2 This case was followed in Progetto (supra), where the relevant date was held to be when this Court dismissed the SLP in the objections petition. The award debtor herein had deposited the entire amount only after the dismissal of the SLP by using the exchange rate as on the date of deposit, which was higher than the rate as on date of dismissal of SLP. Hence, the High Court while deciding the execution petition directed refund of the excess amount by using the date of this Court’s as the relevant date. In so far as the present appeal is concerned, we have already mentioned that the respondent was permitted to withdraw 7.5 crores during the pendency of the proceedings. 9.3 Similarly, in Trammo AG v. MMTC Limited,48 the date of dismissal of review by this Court in the proceedings to set aside the award was held to be the relevant date. 9.4 In Voith Hydro v. NTPC Limited,49 the award debtor had paid some part of the arbitral award amount during the pendency of proceedings to set aside the award. It paid 75% of the amount on 06.11.2018, against bank guarantees by the award holder, in accordance with a Niti Aayog Circular. Subsequently, this Court dismissed the SLP in the 22.09.2020. The High Court held that the exchange rate as on 06.11.2018 would apply insofar as 75% of the deposit is concerned as the claimant had received this part-payment and the exchange rate on 22.09.2020 was higher than on 06.11.2018. Relying on Forasol (supra), Renusagar (supra), and Fuerst Day Lawson (supra), it held that the exchange rate on 22.09.2020 would apply to the remaining amount. 47 2012 SCC OnLine Del 5647 48 2019 SCC OnLine Del 7337 49 2021 SCC OnLine Del 1325 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 311 DLF Ltd. (Formerly Known as DLF Universal Ltd) and Anr. v. Koncar Generators and Motors Ltd. 9.5 In Karamchand Thapar & Bros. (Coal Sales) Ltd. v. MMTC Ltd.,50 the date on which the arbitral award attained finality (when the SLP in the Sections 34 and 37 proceedings was dismissed) was determined as the relevant date for the exchange rate. Here, the award debtor had deposited an amount subsequent to the dismissal of the SLP at the exchange rate as on date of deposit, which was higher than the exchange rate when the SLP was dismissed. The High Court therefore also directed the award holder to refund the excess amount paid by the award debtor. This case does not involve deposit during the pendency of the objections.
