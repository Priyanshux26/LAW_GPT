2.6 The present respondents requested a 6-month extension under Article 2.5 of the PPA on 03.12.2016. This was approved by the appellant through a letter dated 02.03.2017. 2.7 However, by a letter dated 05.04.2017, KERC directed the DISCOMs that all requests for extensions must be filed before it. Pursuant to this letter, the respondents filed a petition before the KERC seeking extension of time for the commercial operation of the project and invoked the force majeure clause in the PPA (Article 8.3). 2.8 During the pendency of the petition, the respondents’ solar power project was commissioned on 24.08.2017, within the extended period of 24 months. 3. KERC’s : In its dated 18.09.2018, the KERC rejected the various causes of delay put forth by the respondents and held that the force majeure clause must be strictly interpreted. First, delay in approval of the PPA by KERC was held to have no bearing on the initial obligations of the SPD in applying for approvals, loans, etc as the respondents had not proved the same. Second, it found that the respondent had applied for conversion of land only on 18.02.2016, over five months after signing the PPA and paid the charges only on 27.12.2016, after which it was allowed on 07.01.2017. Hence, the delay in conversion of land use was attributed to the respondent. Third, the delay in disbursement of loan also did not delay the implementation as the respondent had commenced implementation from its own funds. Fourth, the respondent applied for the evacuation approval only on 25.02.2016, and the regular approval was finally granted on 22.08.2016. Hence, the respondent delayed the application and cannot attribute the same to the authorities. Similarly, the KERC also rejected delay on other grounds such as time taken for delivery of the breaker, and inspection of the project and grant of safety approval. 3.1 It also found that the respondents had not submitted a notice as contemplated under Article 8.3(b)(i) and hence, they are not entitled to invoke force majeure and claim an extension of time under Article 2.5. Since the KERC found that the delay in 1030 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports securing approvals and the consequent delay in commissioning was attributable to the respondents, it imposed liquidated damages under Articles 2.2 and 2.5.7 of the PPA. 3.2 Lastly, the KERC reduced the tariff payable to the respondent to Rs. 4.36 per unit for the term of the PPA by relying on Article 5.1 of the PPA. 4. APTEL’s impugned : The respondent’s appeal against the of the KERC was allowed by the APTEL by the impugned before us. The APTEL dealt with each ground of delay raised by the respondents. First, it took note that the respondent’s application for land conversion was on 16.02.2016, after which it had to procure several documents, including a PTCL certificate, as provided under Rule 106A of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act. Further, these documents must be secured from various government departments, which is a laborious process. The PTCL certificate was issued by the government only on 04.10.2016, although the respondent had applied for it even before signing the PPA.
