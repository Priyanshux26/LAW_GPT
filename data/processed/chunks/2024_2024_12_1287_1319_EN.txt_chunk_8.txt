In Civil Appeal No. 3303 of 1997, an interlocutory application came to be filed by the State of Karnataka seeking permission of this Court to widen the Bellary Road and Jayamahal Road and to complete the same by utilising 15 acres and 39 guntas of the Bengaluru Palace ground; and, to pay compensation to the above land as per the calculation made in the original award. Appellants in various appeals virtually conceded to the needs of the State to widen the road and expressed their willingness to accept the proposal of BBMP made in its letter dated 26.12.2009, whereunder BBMP had agreed to issue TDR for the extent of land acquired as per the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act and the TDR guidelines, subject to final decision of this Court. Having regard to the fact that the State did not grant its approval to the proposal mooted by the BBMP and had instead offered to pay compensation as per the rates relevant at the time of passing of the , this Court disposed of the said application by dated 21.11.2014 and permitted the road widening subject to the condition that the appellants would be given the TDR as per TDR Rules. dated 21.11.2014 reads: “10. In the above circumstances, having considered the submissions of learned counsel for the parties, including learned counsel for the parties in all the connected appeals, without prejudice to the rights of the parties, and keeping in mind the necessity of widening of the road, and the public interest, we think it just and proper to allow I.A. No. 13 of 2011 subject to condition that the appellants in 1300 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the present appeal and the connected appeals shall be given TDR for widening of the road as per TDR Rules.” (Emphasis Supplied by us) 5. The respondent-authorities were required to implicitly implement the aforesaid or in other words issue TDR as per the extant TDR rules. This Court in Rita Markanday v/s Surjit Singh Arora2 has taken the view that even if the parties have not filed an undertaking before the Court, but if the Court is induced to sanction a particular course of action or inaction on the basis of the representation of such a party and the Court ultimately finds that the party never intended to act on such representation or such representation was false then the party would be guilty of committing contempt of court.
