Obviously the two fact finding Courts did not consider these notices as they did not form part of cause of action and it also does not appear that the said facts were admitted to be brought on the record by way of amendment of plaint or otherwise. These notices would run their own course and we also do not want to take cognizance of these subsequent notices as it would be up to the authorities to take such steps as may be permissible in law in respect of the subsequent notices. The tenants shall also be entitled to question the legality thereof, if so advised. 18. We are conscious that the Revisional Court was examining a and decree already tested by the Appellate Forum and on facts, decree was made. Ordinarily the Revisional Court ought not to interfere with findings on fact. But in the under appeal, we find that the Revisional Court has fitted the facts with the legal provisions and found that there was mismatch on the basis of which the and decree were set aside. We have been taken through the of the Revisional Court and do not find any flaw that needs re-appreciation. We accordingly dismiss both the appeals. 19. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan Result of the case: Appeals dismissed.
