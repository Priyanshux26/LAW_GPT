Therefore, it is urged that necessity to arrest, in the case of arrest under Section 19(1), would be an additional factor required to be considered beyond the conditions and factors stipulated in Section 19(1) of the PML Act. 76. DoE submits that the test of “necessity to arrest” is satisfied in view of Arvind Kejriwal failing to appear despite the issuance of 9 summons dated 30.10.2023, 18.12.2023, 22.12.2023, 12.01.2024, 31.01.2024, 14.02.2024, 21.02.2024, 26.02.2024, and 16.03.2024. It is also submitted that arrest is a part and parcel of investigation intended to secure evidence, leading to discovery of material facts and relevant information as held in P. Chidambaram v. Directorate of Enforcement.62 77. On behalf of Arvind Kejriwal, it is submitted that there was no necessity to arrest on 21.03.2024. The RC/ECIR were registered in the month of August 2022. Further, most of the material relied upon in the “reasons to believe” are prior to July 2023. The statements under Section 50 of the PML Act and under Section 164 of the Code, or otherwise, of Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy, Raghav Magunta, Siddharth Reddy, etc., relate to the period prior to July 2023. Thus, it was not necessary to arrest Arvind Kejriwal on 21.03.2024 based on the said material. Lastly, in Pankaj Bansal (supra), this Court observed: “28. Mere non-cooperation of a witness in response to the summons issued under Section 50 of the Act of 2002 would not be enough to render him/her liable to be arrested under Section 19…” 78. As per the data available on the website of the DoE, as on 31.01.2023,63 5,906 ECIRs were recorded. However, search was conducted in 531 ECIRs by issue of 4,954 search warrants. The total number of ECIRs recorded against ex-MPs, MLAs and MLCs was 176. The number of persons arrested is 513. Whereas the number of prosecution complaints filed is 1,142. The data raises a number of questions, including the question whether the DoE has 62 [2019] 12 SCR 172 : (2019) 9 SCC 24 63 The data post 31.01.2023 has not been updated [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2423 Arvind Kejriwal v. Directorate of Enforcement formulated a policy, when they should arrest a person involved in offences committed under the PML Act. 79. We are conscious that the principle of parity or equality enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution cannot be invoked for repeating or multiplying irregularity or illegality. If any advantage or benefit has been wrongly given, another person cannot claim the same advantage as a matter of right on account of the error or mistake. However, this principle may not apply where two or more courses are available to the authorities. The doctrine of need and necessity to arrest possibly accepts the said principle. Section 45 gives primacy to the opinion of the DoE when it comes to grant of bail. DoE should act uniformly, consistent in conduct, confirming one rule for all. 80. One of the developments in the last decade is acceptance of the principle of proportionality, especially when fundamental rights such as right to life and liberty are involved.
