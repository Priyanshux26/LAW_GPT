105 R. K. Sidhwa, Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume 9, 11.08.1949. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1067 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 Whether the Parliament had the competence to specify different conditions under Article 11 136. There is no quarrel among the parties that the Parliament has the power to enact laws on citizenship. This power is provided by Entry 17 of List 1 of the Seventh Schedule, which reads “Citizenship, naturalisation and aliens”. Further, the present situation is also covered by Entry 19, which reads, “Admission into, and emigration and expulsion from, India; passports and visas”. However, the parties are discordant to the extent of such power and whether law made by the Parliament can derogate from Article 6 and other provisions of Part II. 137. In this regard, it is pertinent to consider the objective and scope of Article 11 of the Constitution, which provides Parliament with the power to make laws on any matter relating to citizenship. Upon perusal of the text of Article 11, which was reproduced before in paragraph 19 of this judgement, two important considerations come to light. First, the phrase “Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this Part shall derogate” clearly fortifies that Article 11 confers overriding powers upon the Parliament to make laws even when they are against other provisions of Part II. 138. This was also duly acknowledged by a 5-judge bench of this Court in Izhar Ahmed Khan (supra), where it was explicitly noted that Article 11 grants Parliament the sovereign right to make laws on citizenship and that such laws cannot be impeached on the ground that they go against Articles 5 to 10 of the Constitution. 139. Incidentally, the overriding effect of Article 11 is also clearly established by various speeches in the Constituent Assembly. They highlight that the provisions of Part II were only meant to enact the law on citizenship for the time being at the commencement of the Constitution and the Parliament was empowered to enact provisions in the future, including making altogether new provisions.106 As discussed in paragraph 16 earlier, this is consistent with the global practice of laying down only overarching principles of citizenship 106 Dr. B.

From the phrase “Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this Part shall derogate”, the judicial pronouncement of this Court in Izhar Ahmed Khan (supra) and the accompanying speeches in the Constituent Assembly, we can appropriately conclude that Article 11 gives the Parliament broad powers to enact laws on citizenship, notwithstanding any inconsistencies with any other provision in Part II of the Constitution. 141. The second important aspect of Article 11, which lends support to this conclusion, is that it grants the Parliament the power to make ‘any’ provision regarding citizenship.
