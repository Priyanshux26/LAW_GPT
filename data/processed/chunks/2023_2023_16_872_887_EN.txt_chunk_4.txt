9. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No. 1 submitted that fi ling of the suit for specifi c performance by the appellant seeking to enforce the MoU entered on 31.08.1998 was highly belated. In fact, the appellant had not approached the Court with clean hands. In the aforesaid MoU entered into between the parties, it was mentioned that a litigation is pending between the family members of respondent No. 1 in the High Court and the sale deed will be registered in favour of the appellant in case respondent No. 1 succeeds in litigation and absolute title comes in his favour. The consideration will be mutually agreed at that time. The aforesaid MoU was followed by an agreement executed between the parties on 02.09.1998 with reference to the same property, in which all the terms and conditions for sale of property in case it comes to the share of respondent No. 1, were reduced in writing. It is specifi cally mentioned in Clause (8) of the agreement 10 (1964)7 SCR 831 11 (1970) SCC 186 12 (2015) 11SCC 12: 2014: INSC:748 878 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. that pending litigation in the High Court is likely to be decided in favour of respondent No. 1, however, in case it is not decided favourably within one year from the date of fi rst MoU dated 15.04.1998, the second party, namely, the appellant will have right to get the earnest money back along with interest @ 18% per annum. The aforesaid agreement was deliberately concealed by the appellant while fi ling the civil suit. In terms of the agreement dated 02.09.1998, the only right which was available to the appellant was to get the refund of earnest money along with interest for which the limitation expired long back but no action was taken. 10. It was further argued that the appellant had even issued a notice dated 22.03.2001 for refund of earnest money. Even at the stage of fi ling suit for injunction, the relief of specifi c performance could very well be sought but the appellant failed to seek the same. The suit was not prosecuted by the appellant as the same was dismissed on 06.10.2010 and not disposed of, as claimed by the appellant. A separate suit on a part of cause of action which was already available to the appellant in a suit for injunction, was barred in terms of II Rule 2 C.P.C. The application fi led by respondent No. 1 was rightly allowed by the High Court. The facts, as have been stated by respondent No. 1, have not been disputed by the appellant. He further submitted that though respondent No. 1 expected that 3/4th part of the property will come to his share, however fi nally he got only 1/10th share on which house is constructed and he is living there. In support of his plea, reliance was placed upon Jayakantham and others v. Abaykumar13 and Vurimi Pullarao v. Vemari Vyankata Radharani.14 11.
