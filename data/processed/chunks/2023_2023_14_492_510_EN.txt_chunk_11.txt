12. One factor which has come to our notice in course of hearing is that one of the recovery certifi cates was issued on 08.09.2015. We have already held that the letter dated 29.01.2020 cannot by itself revive the debt though it could create an independent cause of action. A question that arises now is as to whether the debts in connection with the recovery certifi cate issued in the year 2015 could form subject matter of an application under Section 7 of the IBC fi led on 06.09.2019. In the case of Kotak Mahindra I (supra), it was held that CIRP could be brought within three years from the date of issue of recovery certifi cate. 13. What has been fi led before the NCLT is a composite application based on three recovery certifi cates, two of which have been instituted within the three-year period as postulated in Article 137 of the Limitation Act. The third recovery certifi cate was issued in the year 2015. Thus, there is more than three years gap between the date of issue thereof and the date of fi ling of the application before the NCLT. But a recovery certifi cate under the 1993 Act is also clothed with the character of a deemed decree. The provisions of Section 19 (22A) of the 1993 Act specifi es :- “Section 19 Application to the Tribunal: - ……….. (22A) Any recovery certifi cate issued by the Presiding Offi cer under sub-section (22) shall be deemed to be decree or of the Court for the purposes of initiation of winding up proceedings against a company registered under the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013) or Limited Liability Partnership registered under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 (6 of 2009) or insolvency proceedings against 508 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. any individual or partnership fi rm under any law for the time being in force, as the case may be. ]” Life of a decree is twelve years for enforcement as per Article 136 of the schedule of Limitation Act. The said provision stipulates:- “Description of application Period of Time from which period begins limitation to run 136. For the execution of Twelve [When] the decree or any decree (other than years. becomes enforceable or where a decree granting a the decree or any subsequent mandatory injunction) directs any payment of or of any civil money or the delivery of any court. property to be made at a certain date or at recurring periods, when default in making the payment or delivery in respect of which execution is sought, takes place: Provided that an application for the enforcement or execution of a decree granting a perpetual injunction shall not be subject to any period of limitation.” 14. There is authority for the proposition that the time for computing limitation period for fi ling an application under Section 7 of the IBC would be guided by Article 137 of the Limitation Act. That is the ratio of this Court in the case of Kotak Mahindra I (supra).
