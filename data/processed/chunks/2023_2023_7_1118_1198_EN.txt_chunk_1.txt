Disposing of the appeals, the Court HELD: 1. The Division Bench also referred to the F principles governing the grant or refusal of temporary injunction and pointed out that the directions given by the learned Single Judge for convening the meeting only with the joint consent of Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator was leading to a situation where the party as a whole would undergo irreparable hardship because there was no possibility of the appellant and the G respondent No.1 – OPS and EPS – acting jointly to convene the meeting. The Division Bench pointed out that the directions of the learned Single Judge would only further the “functional deadlock” already existing in the party. [Para 26.2][1191-B-D] H 1120 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A 2. The facts of the case make it abundantly clear that so far as convening of the meeting dated 23.06.2022 is concerned, the same had never been in doubt or in any dispute. The said meeting was indeed convened by the Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator jointly. They had been working in tandem until that stage. However, they seem to have fallen apart immediately thereafter, B particularly when a proposition for amendment of the byelaws and reverting to the system of single leadership was in the offing. In any case, the meeting dated 23.06.2022 was duly convened and the efforts to prevent the same did not meet with success in the Court. Even if the slated business was not transacted in the C meeting dated 23.06.2022, all that had happened in that meeting could not have been ignored. It remains undeniable that the plaintiff OPS and the persons standing with him were also very much present in the said meeting. The General Council is said to be consisting of 2665 members. If 2190 members out of these 2665 gave a requisition on 23.06.2022 for convening the General D Council meeting and the Presidium Chairman announced the date of this requisitioned meeting as 11.07.2022, in the given set of facts and circumstances, such announcement, at least at the present stage, cannot be dubbed as wholly redundant. At that point of time, when Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator were E shown to be not functioning jointly (for whatsoever reason), a functional deadlock came into existence for the party and a workable solution was required to be found. In the given scenario, the actions and steps taken by the requisitioning members as also by the Presidium Chairman cannot be declared as unwarranted or illegal at this stage. That being the position, F convening of meeting dated 11.07.2022 could not have been taken as an act unauthorised. The learned Single Judge while passing the dated 17.08.2022 seems to have fallen in serious error and said was clearly suffering from perversity when convening of the meeting dated 11.07.2022 was taken as an act G unauthorised. The Division Bench of the High Court, has rightly looked at the substance of the matter and realities of the situation. [Para 28.1][1192-A-G] 3. The other alleged infirmity about want of clear 15 days’ notice has also been rightly dealt with by the Division Bench of H the High Court in the impugned dated 02.09.2022.
