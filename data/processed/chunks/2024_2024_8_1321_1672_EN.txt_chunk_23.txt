In Indra Sawhney (supra),33 this Court held that it is constitutional to classify the backward class into the ‘backward’ and the ‘more backward’ class of citizens. The provisions of Articles 341, 342, and 342A are pari materia. That being the case, this Court has to analyse how a contrary conclusion to the effect that sub- classification is permissible within the Backward Class but not within the Scheduled Castes, could be reached. In Indra Sawhney (supra) the phrase “Backward Classes” in Article 16(4) was interpreted to include both socially and educationally backward classes and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes;34 28 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sinha, 104] 29 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sinha, 105] 30 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sinha, 112,113] 31 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sinha, 114] 32 [2020] 10 SCR 857 : (2020) 8 SCC 1 33 (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [Justice Reddy,803];[Justice Sawant, 524 and 525] 34 (2020) 8 SCC 1 [42] [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1353 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. b. The Scheduled Castes are not a homogenous class.35 Preferential treatment can be given to the most downtrodden of the class who are not adequately represented. Such a sub- classification is made to provide equality of opportunity, so as to achieve the purpose of reservation;36 c. It would be open to the State, under Article 16(4), to grant the benefits of reservation on a rational basis to certain castes within the Scheduled Castes by fixing a reasonable quota of the reserved seats for them if they are inadequately represented;37 and d. Preferential treatment to certain castes would not lead to the exclusion of other castes from the list prepared under Article 341.38 In Jarnail Singh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta,39 this Court observed that the exclusion of the “creamy layer” from the Scheduled Castes for securing the benefit of reservation does not tinker with the Presidential List under Article 341. All the castes included in the list of Scheduled Castes are given the benefit of reservation even if they are sub-classified. B. Submissions 19. The submissions of the counsel were restricted to the issue of whether the of this Court in Chinnaiah (supra) requires to be reconsidered since the High Court had held that the Punjab Act and the Haryana Notification were unconstitutional solely for the reason that they are contrary to the above . i. Submissions of Petitioners 20. Mr Gurminder Singh, Advocate General for the State of Punjab and Mr Shadan Farasat, Additional Advocate General made the following submissions: a. The in Chinnaiah (supra) erroneously treats the Scheduled Castes as an indivisible monolith/block; 35 Relied on the observation of Justice Reddy in Indra Sawhney (supra) 36 (2020) 8 SCC 1 [50] 37 (2020) 8 SCC 1 [52, 56] 38 (2020) 8 SCC 1 [35] 39 [2018] 10 SCR 663 : (2018) 10 SCC 396 1354 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports b. Preferential treatment promotes substantive equality. Chinnaiah (supra) is against the very idea of reservations which mandates protective discrimination based on relative backwardness; c. Justice SB Sinha’s in Chinnaiah (supra) is self- contradictory.
