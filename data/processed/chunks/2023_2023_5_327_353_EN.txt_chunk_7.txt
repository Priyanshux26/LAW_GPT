Both Pradeep Vinod Construction Company (supra) and Parmar Construction Company (supra) were cases relating to Section 11. However, neither of the case distinguished the second part D of Section 26 of the Amendment Act, 2015 as relating to judicial proceedings. It is further submitted that, in Parmar Construction Company (supra), reliance was placed on Aravali Power Company Private Limited Vs. Era Infra Engineering Limited, (2017) 15 SCC 32 (Para 22), to examine the effect of Section 21 of the principal Act read with Section 26 of the Amendment Act, 2015. It is submitted E that the reliance placed on Aravali Power Company Private Limited (supra) in the case of Parmar Construction Company (supra) is completely misplaced. Firstly, neither Section 21 of the principal Act nor Section 26 of the Amendment Act, 2015 were discussed in Aravali Power Company Private Limited (supra). Secondly, the decision in F Aravali Power Company Private Limited (supra) did not concern judicial proceedings but applications filed before the arbitrator challenging his qualification under Sections 12 and 13. It is submitted that therefore, the second part of Section 26 did not come for consideration at all. 3.8 It is submitted that similarly, the reliance placed in Parmar G Construction Company (supra) on S.P. Singla Constructions Private Limited Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh and Anr., (2019) 2 SCC 488 (Para 16) is again misplaced because in S.P. Singla Constructions Private Limited (supra) issue also involved was disqualifications of an arbitrator under Section 12 and consequent filing of Section 11 petitions prior to coming into force of the Amendment Act, H 2015. M/S. SHREE VISHNU CONSTRUCTIONS v. THE ENGINEER IN 337 CHIEF MILITARY ENGINEERING SERVICE [M. R. SHAH, J.] 3.9 It is submitted that on the other hand, this Court in Ssangyong A Engineering and Construction Company Limited Vs. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), (2019) 15 SCC 131 (Para 19), has held that, Section 34 as amended in 2015, will apply only to Section 34 applications that have been made to the Court on or after 23.10.2015, irrespective of the fact that the arbitration proceedings may B have commenced prior to that date and while doing so, this Court followed the in BCCI (supra). 3.10 It is submitted that in to get over the in BCCI (supra), the Parliament omitted Section 26 of the Amendment Act, 2015 w.e.f. 23.10.2015 by way of Section 15 of the Arbitration and Conciliation C (Amendment) Act, 2019, which was notified on 30.08.2019. It is further submitted that the validity of Section 15 was inter alia challenged in Hindustan Construction Company Limited and Anr. Vs. Union of India and Ors., (2020) 17 SCC 324 (Three Judge Bench). It is submitted that this Court held that, though the basis for the in BCCI (supra) was removed, but still found that Section 15 of the D Amendment Act, 2019 was unconstitutional as being manifestly arbitrary. What is noteworthy is that despite having noticed that the Justice Srikrishna committee report held that the Amendment Act, 2015 must apply to arbitrations, which commenced on or after 23.10.2015 and related court proceedings, the Court struck down the amendment and resurrected E the law as stated in BCCI (supra).
