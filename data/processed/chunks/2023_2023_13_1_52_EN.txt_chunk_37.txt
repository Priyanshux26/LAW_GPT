“28. The principles that can be deduced from the law laid down by this Court, as referred to above, are: I. A statute which is made by a competent legislature is valid till it is declared unconstitutional by a court of law. II. After declaration of a statute as unconstitutional by a court of law, it is non est for all purposes. III. In declaration of the law, the doctrine of prospective overruling can be applied by this Court to save past transactions under earlier decisions superseded or statutes held unconstitutional. IV. Relief can be moulded by this Court in exercise of its power under Article 142 of the Constitution, notwithstanding the declaration of a statute as unconstitutional. (emphasis supplied)” 43. From the above discussion, it is crystal clear that once a law is declared to be unconstitutional, being violative of Part-III of the Constitution, then it would be held to be void ab initio, still born, unenforceable and non est in view of Article 13(2) of the Constitution and its interpretation by authoritative pronouncements. Thus, the declaration made by the Constitution Bench in the case of Subramanian Swamy (supra) will have retrospective operation. Section 6A of the DSPE Act is held to be not in force from the date of its insertion i.e. 11.09.2003. 44. As indicated in the earlier part of this , this Court has not delved into the other issues and arguments not germane to the reference . 45. Accordingly, the matters may be placed before the appropriate Bench to be heard and decided on merits.
