41. To sum up, having sought quantified damages of ₹1,63,97,673/-, it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to adduce evidence in support of their claim for this pre-determined sum. However, no evidence whatsoever was produced by them in support of the land values relevant to any point in time, be it of the original final plot or the final plot that was ultimately given to them. In the absence of such crucial material, the plaintiffs’ prayer for compensation necessarily had to be negated. Further, as there was never any guarantee that a plot owner who surrendered his land pursuant to a Town Planning Scheme would be allotted any land after reconstitution of the plots, the plaintiffs cannot assert any vested right in that regard. 42. On the above analysis, we are of the considered opinion that the High Court was fully justified in allowing the first appeal filed by the Corporation and non-suiting the plaintiffs in entirety. The impugned does not brook interference on any count. The appeals are, therefore, bereft of merit and are accordingly dismissed. In the circumstances, parties shall bear their respective costs. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
