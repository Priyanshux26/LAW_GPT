Viswanathan, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. These cases highlight the complications that may arise if adequate caution and circumspection are not exercised, while passing interim s in judicial proceedings. The two appellants are colleges to whom the Director, Medical Education (hereinafter referred to as the [2024] 11 S.C.R. 703 Ramkrishna Medical College Hospital & Research Centre v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. ‘Director’) issued s dated 26.09.2023 directing them to keep one MBBS seat vacant in the appellant-colleges with a direction that the said seat will not be included in the College Level Counseling (CLC) Round for the academic year 2023-24. The direction was issued pursuant to the interim dated 22.09.2023 passed by the High Court in Writ Petitions filed by the respondent students. 3. In the first matter, the Writ Petition was dismissed on 04.03.2024 denying the relief to the Writ Petitioner-student (R-5 herein). In the second matter also, the Writ Petition was dismissed on 22.12.2023 denying the relief to the student-writ petitioner (R-4 herein). The appellant-colleges have been caught in the crossfire and their attempt to intervene having failed in the High Court, they are before us seeking a compensatory seat in the subsequent academic year.
