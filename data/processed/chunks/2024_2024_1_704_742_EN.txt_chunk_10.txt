In this background the objection of the State of Goa to the criteria of the FSI to identify the open forest that is 0.1 canopy density and the area above 1 (one) hectare would not stand to reason. Elaborating the submissions, he would contend that the ISFR has identified 552 square kilometres on the basis of criteria fixed by it and if the said criteria is not adopted it would reduce the open forest area in the State of Goa to an extent of 552 square kilometre. Hence, he prays for the petition being allowed. 35. As mentioned in the submissions of the Appellant in the preceding paragraphs, to summarise, the Appellant herein prays for revisiting the criteria for identification of private forest/deemed forest on private lands in the State of Goa, by using the parameters used by FSI, that is based on 0.1 density forest in an area of 1 (one) ha.

(S) 1,4,5,6,7 & 8 ALONG WITH CONTENTIONS OF THE IMPLEADING PARTY I.E., CREDAI. 36. The respondents have sought the modification and vacation of the above-mentioned in the IA No.40261 of 2017 filed by them, and further have made submissions and raised various grounds for the dismissal of the present Civil Appeal Nos.12234-12235 of 2018. The respondents have urged that the Stay dated 04.02.2015 of this Court, has continued to operate for over eight years, which is impacting several developmental works in the State of Goa. In addition to this, by way of their Counter Affidavit, and numerous submissions made during the hearing of the present appeals, the Senior Counsel has raised several grounds for the dismissal of the present appeals and for vacation of the dated 04.02.2015. 37.

In furtherance of this, the learned Senior Counsel for Respondent No. (s) 1,4,5,6,7 and 8 along with the learned Senior Counsel for the impleading party, i.e., CREDAI have raised various grounds and made elaborate submissions for the dismissal of the present appeals, which have been recorded by us in the subsequent paragraphs. 38. The respondent(s) contended that the criteria for identification of forest has attained finality and cannot be challenged on the principles of res judicata. It was submitted that the criteria for identification of forest on private land was determined in 1991 pursuant to the Judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 27.11.1990 in Shivanand Salgaonkar case (supra). 39. It was further submitted that the criteria for identification of forests, which forms the basis of the reports filed by the Sawant, Karapurkar and Sharma Reports, were first proposed by the Forest Department of the State of Goa, in 1991. The Forest Department had proposed a crown density of 40% and a minimum area of 5 (five) Ha since it was not viable in the long run for the forest department to conserve small patches of forest land, as is evident from the letter dated 04.10.1991, and from the Affidavit filed by the State of Goa before this Court on 21.08.2012.
