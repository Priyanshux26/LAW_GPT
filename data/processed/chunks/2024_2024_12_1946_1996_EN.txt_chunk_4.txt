which may be delegated to an authorised signatory – However, such authorisation would not render the authorised signatory as the maker of those cheques – It is the company alone which would continue to be the maker of these cheques, and thus also the drawer within the meaning of Section 7 of the NI Act – The authorised signatory is merely the physical limb that signs and makes the cheque on behalf of the company’s incorporeal personality – The company, for all purposes, continues to remain the drawer of the cheques. [Paras 45, 46] Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – Cheque drawn upon a joint account – Liability upon account holders of a joint account – Discussed: Held: A company vis-à-vis its authorised signatory stands on a completely different footing as compared to account holders of a joint account – In the former, it is only the company which holds an account with the banker, whereas in the latter, each joint account holder can be said to hold an account with the banker – Thus, while in the case of a cheque drawn on the account of the company the authorised signatory cannot be held to be the drawer, in the case of a cheque drawn upon a joint account, each account holder affixing his signature to the cheque may be said to have drawn such a cheque. [Para 47] Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 – “any debt or other liability” appearing in s.138 of the Act – Scope of: Held: Section 138 of the NI Act does not envisage that only those cases where a cheque issued towards the discharge of the personal liability of the drawer towards the payee gets dishonoured would come within the ambit of the provision – The expression “of any debt or other liability” appearing in Section 138 when read with the Explanation to the provision is wide enough to bring any debt or liability which is legally enforceable within its fold – Thus, the requirement under the provision is that the debt or any other liability has to be legally enforceable and the emphasis is not on the existence of such debt or other liability between the drawer and the payee – Even those cases where a person assumes the 1952 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports responsibility of discharging the debt of some other person, and in furtherance thereof draws a cheque on an account maintained by him, which subsequently gets dishonoured upon being presented before the drawee, would be covered by Section 138 if the payee is able to establish that there was some sort of an arrangement by way of which the debt was assumed by the drawer.
