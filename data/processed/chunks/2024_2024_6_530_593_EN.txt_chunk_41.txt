There is no room for any outside body between the Governor and the High Court.” 41 AC Thalwal v High Court of Himachal Pradesh (2000) 7 SCC 1; Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association v Union of India (1993) 4 SCC 441; Hari Dutt Kainthla v State of Himachal Pradesh, 1980 3 SCC 189 42 [1958] 1 SCR 533 : AIR 1957 SC 912 43 [2011] 12 SCR 496 : (2011) 10 SCC 1 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 589 Abhimeet Sinha & Ors. v. High Court of Judicature at Patna & Ors. 91. At this stage, it needs to be clarified that this Court is not tasked to authoritatively decide whether consultation with Public Service Commission should be “mandatory” or “directory” under Article 234 of the Constitution of India. The question that needs to be answered in these matters is whether the Rules would be rendered void, in case the Public Service Commission itself didn’t wish to be consulted? The letter dated 10.6.2005, written by the Joint Secretary of the Public Service Commission is relevant and is extracted as follows: - “Sir, With reference to the subject noted above, vide the Notification No. GK-2005-5-JSR-1982-994-D, dated 9/05/2005 of the Legal Department, the recruitment rules of instant post have been issued.

The above discussion persuades us to say that the Governor is under no compulsion to consult the Public Service Commission in case the Commission does not wish to be consulted. Such a course would be in consonance with the proviso to Article 320(3) of the Constitution. The concerned Gujarat Rules cannot, therefore, be declared to be void on this count. 94. For the Writ Petitioner, reliance has been placed by Mr. Pawanshree Agarwal on the decision of the Bombay High Court in Goa Judicial Officer’s Association v State of Goa44 to argue that the consultation 44 1997(4) BOM CR 372 590 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports with Public Service Commission is mandatory. While it is true that the Bombay High Court decided that the consultation is mandatory, a careful reading of the would show that the Court refused to grant any relief to the petitioner therein noting that this was an issue between the Government and the PSC and the petitioner could not claim any cause of action. The High Court specifically noted as under: “20.
