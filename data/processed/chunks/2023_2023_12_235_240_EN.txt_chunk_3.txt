8. It must be noted here that the State Government implemented the in the case of Shri N. Ramesh. In another passed by a learned Single Judge of Karnataka High Court on 30th July 2012, in Writ Petition no. 62679 of 2012 and other connected matters (Irayya & Ors. v. The Secretary & Ors. ), a direction was issued in favour of the similarly placed employees who were entitled to revised UGC pay scales with eff ect from 1st January 1996 along with all consequential benefi ts. The was confi rmed by a Division Bench by an dated 27th August 2013. 9. Along with the same application, the appellants have produced a copy of the dated 7th January 2014 in the case of one Shri K.C. Patil and Shri S.H. Hallur, who were retired librarians. By the said , the two librarians, who were similarly placed as the appellants, were granted the benefi t of the revised pay scale from 1st January 1996 along with consequential benefi ts in terms of the dated 15th November 1999. Therefore, not only in the case of Shri N. Ramesh but even thereafter in 2014, to the employees who were similarly placed as the appellants, the benefi ts of the revised UGC pay scale in terms of the Government dated 15th November 1999 were granted. 10. The State Government ought to have applied for review of the of this Court in the case of Shri N. Ramesh. However, the Government had allowed the said to become fi nal. Notwithstanding the Government 240 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. of 4th July 2008, as can be seen from the additional documents, the benefi t was granted to the employees who were similarly placed with the appellants even on 7th January 2014. It was a conscious decision of the State Government to accept the decision of the High Court in the case of Shri N. Ramesh. Now, the State Government cannot rely upon the Government dated 4th July 2008, which was not pointed out to the Courts which dealt with the case of Shri N. Ramesh as the State Government accepted the in the case of Shri N. Ramesh and granted benefi ts to him of the Government dated 15th November 1999. There is no reason why the appellants should be denied the same relief, especially when even as of 7th January 2014, the same benefi t was granted to the similarly placed employees. 11. Accordingly, the impugned dated 9th October 2017 is hereby quashed and set aside. We direct the State Government to extend the benefi ts under the Government dated 15th November 1999 to the appellants within a period of three months from today. The appeals are, accordingly, allowed on the above terms with no as to costs. 12. We make it clear that this will apply to all cases, pending before either the Administrative Tribunal or High Court, of similarly situated employees in which a similar relief is claimed. However, this shall not be used to fi le new cases by retired employees who have been denied the benefi t and who have not challenged the action till date.
