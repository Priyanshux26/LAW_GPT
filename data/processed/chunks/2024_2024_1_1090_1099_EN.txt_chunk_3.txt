We, further, restrain the defendant no.1 appellant from creating any third party interest in relation to the property-in-suit including granting of any licence in favour of any third party during the pendency of this appeal. With the aforesaid directions, the application for stay, filed under C.A.N. 7021 of 2009, is, thus, disposed of. We make no as to costs Let the hearing of the appeal be expedited……” [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1095 Amit Kumar Das, Joint Secretary, Baitanik, A Registered Society v. Shrimati Hutheesingh Tagore Charitable Trust 7. By dated 10.08.2010, the High Court is stated to have extended the time to deposit the sum of ₹10 lakh by a period of two months, but it is an admitted fact that the said deposit was made only on 22.12.2010. 8. Pertinent to note, the Society also filed CAN. 8838 of 2010 in its appeal seeking leave to let out a portion of the suit premises. However, by dated 07.03.2011, the High Court rejected the said application. 9. Developments thereafter led to initiation of contempt proceedings by the Trust, in C.P.A.N. 2113 of 2013, alleging violation of the condition set out in the stay dated 03.03.2010. More particularly, it was alleged that the Society had resorted to letting out the suit premises for holding exhibitions. While considering this allegation, a Division Bench of the High Court at Calcutta took note of the Report dated 06.06.2013 of the Sub-Inspector of Bhawanipore Police Station, confirming that Ms. Sofia Khatoon and Ms. Roommee Bhattacharya had jointly held an exhibition from 13.05.2013 to 19.05.2013 on the ground floor of the suit premises after paying a sum of ₹6,000/- to the Society towards rent. The Division Bench also noted that a receipt had been issued by the contemnor, viz., Amit Kumar Das, the Joint Secretary of the Society, as if it was a donation instead of rent for use of the suit premises. On his behalf, it was contended that the very purpose of the Society was to promote and spread the culture of Tagore amongst the public, through songs, dramas, dances and literary discussions, and even if any such events were held in the suit premises, there was no change in the character of the property. The Division Bench further noted that the inquiring officer had learnt that, after the of the High Court, the Society was collecting rent in the garb of donations by letting out the suit premises for holding exhibitions. 10. Observing that one of the conditions of the stay dated 03.03.2010 was that the Society must maintain status quo as regards possession of the suit premises pending the appeal and refrain from creating any third-party interest in relation thereto, including by way of grant of a licence, the Division Bench concluded that the Society had, in fact, granted licences for short terms to third parties for the purpose of exhibitions, dances and other functions on payment of donations. Further, the Division Bench noted that all the functions which were being held at the suit premises, in lieu of donations, were 1096 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
