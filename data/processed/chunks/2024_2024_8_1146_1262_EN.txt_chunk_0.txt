Central Bureau of Investigation on the Audit Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) or independently investigated the matter: Held: The file produced by the respondent-CBI reveals that premised on the Source Information Report (SIR) submitted by an Inspector from the Department pertaining to some irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks under the Government Dispensation Category allegedly in connivance with public servants, the matter was taken up by CBI for verification – The notings in the file states that it was not possible to verify the allegations discretely – Therefore, the SIR was directed to be registered as a PE – These records falsifies the suggestion made by the respondent-CBI that there was a SIR that disclosed irregularities in the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) executed between M/s. Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL) and KECML – The stand of the respondent-CBI that PE-5 was registered well before the Audit Report of the CAG and originated independently thereof, is also factually misleading because CBI’s own record shows that the scope of enquiry in respect of PE-5 registered on 28.09.2012, was entirely different and had no relationship with the JVA and other agreements executed by KPCL and KECML – Thus, the plea of the respondent-CBI that it conducted an investigation in the present case during the course of the inquiry in respect of PE-5 registered by it in the year 2012 is belied as the Source Information Report (SIR) was on a completely different aspect – CBI only got activated only on stumbling upon the Audit Report of the CAG submitted in 2013 – There is nothing brought on record to show to the contrary.
