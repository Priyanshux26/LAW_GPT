2 under the guise of the court’s . It is a matter of surprise for us that the High Court also could not notice the ill-intention of the respondent nos. 1 and 2 and disposed of the petition, permitting them to go ahead with the original tender, ignoring the reports of the independent committee and the observations made by the Single Bench in the dated 08.01.2021 with regard to the irregularities and illegalities committed by the officers of the respondent no. 1 HIMUDA. 13. The impugned having been passed without proper application of mind and without assigning any cogent reason for brushing aside the findings recorded by the Independent Committee and the observations made by the Single Bench in the dated 08.01.2021, the same deserves to be quashed and set aside. Since, we have found that the respondent no.1 HIMUDA, though ‘State’ within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India, had acted malafide and in collusion with the respondent no.2, and had taken the High Court for a ride, the present appeal deserves to be allowed with heavy cost. 14. In that view of the matter, the impugned passed by the High Court is set aside. The appeal is allowed with cost of Rs. 5,00,000/- to be deposited by the respondent no. 1 HIMUDA with the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association, within two weeks from today. However, it is clarified that the respondent no.1 shall be at liberty to initiate a fresh tender process in accordance with law and after following the due process of law.
