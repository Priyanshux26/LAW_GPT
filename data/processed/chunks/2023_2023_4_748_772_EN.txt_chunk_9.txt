In Shankar Kisanrao Khade (supra) the court fashioned ‘the crime’; ‘the criminal’ and ‘the E R&R test’ (rarest of rare test) which emphasized the need to look intensively into all factors. This court also highlighted that in many previous decisions, sentencing was resorted to without considering mitigating circumstances, and without any material on the possibility of reformation of the convict. F The decision in Sriharan 15. In Swamy Shraddananda (supra) this court had to decide the appropriate sentence to be imposed in a case, where two judges had differed on the issue of imposition of capital sentence. The court considered its previous Constitution Bench ruling in Gopal Vinayak G Godse v. State of Maharashtra22, observations in other s (such as Dalbir Singh v. State of Punjab23, Subash Chander v. Krishan Lal24; Shri Bhagwan v. State of Rajasthan25; State of Madhya 22 [1961] 3 SCR 440 23 [1979] 3 SCR 1059: (1979) 3 SCC 745 24 [2001] 2 SCR 864: (2001) 4 SCC 458 H 25 [2001] 3 SCR 656: (2001) 6 SCC 296 VIKAS CHAUDHARY v. THE STATE OF DELHI 761 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] Pradesh v. Ratan Singh26 and other cases). The court had, in Swamy A Shraddananda (supra), observed as follows [SCR, p. 143-144]: “65. […] The legal position as enunciated in Kishori Lal v. King Emperor, (1945) 58 LW 251 , Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra, (1961) 3 SCR 440; Maru Ram v. Union of India, (1981) 1 SCR 1196; State of M.P. v. Ratan Singh, B (1976) 3 SCC 470 and Shri Bhagwan v. State of Rajasthan, (2001) 6 SCC 296 and the unsound way in which remission is actually allowed in cases of life imprisonment make out a very strong case to make a special category for the very few cases where the death penalty might be substituted by the C punishment of imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term in excess of fourteen years and to put that category beyond the application of remission. 66. The matter may be looked at from a slightly different angle. The issue of sentencing has two aspects. A sentence may be excessive and unduly harsh or it may be highly D disproportionately inadequate. When an appellant comes to this Court carrying a death sentence awarded by the trial court and confirmed by the High Court, this Court may find, as in the present appeal, that the case just falls short of the rarest of the rare category and may feel somewhat reluctant E in endorsing the death sentence. But at the same time, having regard to the nature of the crime, the Court may strongly feel that a sentence of life imprisonment subject to remission normally works out to a term of 14 years would be grossly disproportionate and inadequate. What then should the Court do? If the Court’s option is limited only to two punishments, F one a sentence of imprisonment, for all intents and purposes, of not more than 14 years and the other death, the Court may feel tempted and find itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty.
