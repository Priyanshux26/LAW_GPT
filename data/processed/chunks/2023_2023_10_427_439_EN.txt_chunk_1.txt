On 14.06.1996, the Appellant was appointed for 6 months on probation on a consolidated pay of Rs.1000/- per month. F On 22.01.1997, Director of Local Bodies, West Bengal, issued a letter, wherein it was mentioned that as per dated 13.03.1996, casual workers who were engaged by different Urban Local Bodies up to 31.12.1991 and were still continuing as such will be eligible for absorption against sanctioned and vacant Group “C” and “D” categories of post depending upon their eligibility within the purview of approved staff pattern G of the respective Urban Local Bodies and as per the Board of the Councillors, subject to the fulfilment of terms and conditions. However, such absorption never actually happened. 5. In 1999, the Appellant herein along with 16 other casual workers of Respondent No. 3- Municipality filed Writ Petition No. 19555 (W) of H OM PRAKASH BANERJEE v. THE STATE OF WEST BENGAL 429 & ORS. [KRISHNA MURARI, J.] 1999 before the High Court, seeking a writ of mandamus directing A Respondent No. 3- Municipality herein to regularise and/or absorb in permanent vacancies in which they were discharging their duties as casual workers. On 09.03.2000, an office was issued by Respondent No.- 3 Municipality stating that in pursuance of his satisfactory performance since last 3 years, he is being appointed in the post of Clerk B in the dispatch section in the scale of Rs. 3350-6325/- plus usual admissible allowances with retrospective effect from February, 2000. On 20.06.2000, the High Court dismissed the aforementioned Writ Petition No. 19555 (W) of 1999. The relevant portion of the High Court’s is being reproduced hereunder :- C “By the dated 26th September, 1996 passed in C.O. No. 9662(W) of 1991, the respondent municipality was directed to consider the case of the writ petitioners for absorption in the permanent vacancy. Pursuant to the said , the case of the petitioners were considered and they were ultimately absorbed in permanent vacancies. Prior to such absorption, D the petitioners were serving as casual workers. Upon such absorption, the petitioners have been granted the regular scale of pay with effect from the date of their permanent absorption. Such permanent absorption was made considering the service of the writ petitioners as casual E workers in the respondent municipality for a considerable period of time and therefore, such permanent absorption in the regular vacancy did not relate to an appointment with a retrospective effect and as such the petitioners are not entitled to such a permanent and/or regular scale upon such absorption with a back date. F This writ petition does not submit any consideration. Hence, the case is dismissed.” Following this, the Appellant wrote several letters and reminders to the Respondents for considering his eligibility and gradation list for G absorption under the exempted category to the sanctioned posts; but to no avail. 6. On 15.12.2003, 60 employees including 4 Writ Petitioners in the aforementioned Writ Petition No. 19555 (W) of 1999, were regularised. However, the Appellant’s service has not been regularised H 430 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R.
