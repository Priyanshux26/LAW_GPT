Act was defeated – The claim petition was kept for 4 years and it was dismissed only on the ground of lack of jurisdiction – The High Court has fallen in error in not picking up the illegalities resulting in failure of justice and to resolve them appropriately – Considering the circumstances, the matter remanded back to the Tribunal, to proceed further and to decide the claim petition on merits. [Paras 17, 26, 28, 32] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – s.21 – Objection as to lack of territorial jurisdiction would not make a /decree nullity: Held: A bare perusal of Section 21, CPC would reveal that objection as to the place of suing is not to be entertained by any Appellate or Revisional Court if it was not taken in the Court of first instance at the earliest possible opportunity and unless there has been a consequent failure of justice – While looking into the object and reasons for the aforesaid provision it is very clear as to why lack of territorial jurisdiction by itself was not recognized under it as a reason to make a /decree a nullity – It is to be noted that it is quite different and distinct from inherent lack of jurisdiction which would strike at the very authority of the Court to try a case and pass a /decree and would make it a nullity – On a careful consideration of the provisions under Section 21, CPC, it would make it clear though taking of an objection as to the lack of territorial jurisdiction before the Court of first instance at the earliest opportunity is a condition required to raise that objection before an appellate or revisional Court satisfaction of such condition by itself would not make an award granting compensation a nullity inasmuch as in such cases there would not be inherent lack of 1206 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports jurisdiction in Court in regard to the subject matter – Therefore, in such cases, correction by a Court is open, only if it occasions in failure of justice – The provision thus, reflects the legislative intention that all possible care should be taken to ensure that the time, energy and labour spent by a Court did not go in vain unless there has been a consequent failure of justice.
