the Sri Thakur Nigamananda High School, Terundia. 9. Learned counsel submitted that facts have been duly verifi ed from the records of advertisement, resolution, appointment letter, attendance register and renewal register pertaining to the appellant by the competent authority; and in this background, he was approved by the dated 02.04.2005 as eligible to receive block grant. BICHITRANANDA BEHERA v. STATE OF ORISSA AND 409 OTHERS [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] 10. Learned counsel further submitted that the Inspector of Schools in his counter affi davit has clearly stated that there is no other appointee and also no record available, either in the School or in the Inspectorate, relating to the appointment of Respondent No.5. Thus, it was contended that the Tribunal has not given any fi nding with regard to the records relating to the appointment of Respondent No.5 and the High Court has also clearly erred in ignoring the relevant factual matrix as disclosed in the concerned contemporaneous records duly verifi ed by the competent authority of the State. It was further contended that the two fora below have wrongly interpreted the term ‘Competent Management’ in the dated 23.07.1999, which was only in reference to sending of a proposal with regard to the future reconstitution of the Managing Committee and has no relevance on the issue of appointment having been made by the Managing Committee constituted on 15.12.1992, which in no way can be said to be incompetent or illegal even on the principle of ‘de facto doctrine’, more so, when the Managing Committee constituted on 15.12.1992 had managed the school for six years and the High Court has not invalidated any action or decision taken by it during the said period. 11. It was contended that even on merit, on the day the Respondent No.5 is said to have been appointed i.e., 10.01.1993, he did not possess BPED or CPED qualifi cation and thus, could not have been appointed. He further submitted that the recommendation for renewal in favour of the appellant was sent every year as per the requirement and he was also assigned election duty on three occasions. SUBMISSIONS OF THE STATE: 12. Learned counsel for the State has fi led the counter-affi davit. The State has supported the case put forth by the appellant. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT No.5: 13. Learned counsel for Respondent No.5, per contra, submitted that the High Court in its dated 23.07.1999 has noted that the Managing Committee constituted on 28.12.1992 was the only competent Managing Committee which has appointed the Respondent No.5, hence the same is valid. It was submitted that the appellant, having been appointed by the Managing Committee constituted on 15.12.1992, could 410 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. not have been so appointed without lawful termination of the service of Respondent No.5 and most importantly, the dated 23.07.1999, having not been challenged, had attained fi nality. With regard to the qualifi cation of Respondent No.5 i.e., his non-fulfi lment of the criteria of appointment on 10.01.1993, learned counsel submitted that, later, on 03.06.1996, Respondent No.5 did acquire the training qualifi cation of B.P.Ed.
