We hold, therefore, that in the circumstances of the present case there was no sale and the purchasers acquired no rights at all.” 29. Relying on Manilal Mohanlal case [AIR 1954 SC 349] Rules 84, 85 and 86 of 21 were also held to be mandatory in Sardara Singh v. Sardara Singh [(1990) 4 SCC 90]. Similarly in Balram v. Ilam Singh [(1996) 5 SCC 705] this Court reiterated the legal position in the following words: (SCC p. 711, para 7) “7. … it was clearly held [in Manilal Mohanlal [AIR 1954 SC 349] ] that Rule 85 being mandatory, its non-compliance renders the sale proceedings a complete nullity requiring the executing court to proceed under Rule 86 and property has to be resold unless the -debtor satisfies the decree by making the payment before the resale. The argument that the executing court has inherent power to extend time on the ground of its own mistake was also expressly rejected.” 30. We may also refer to the decisions of this Court in Rao Mahmood Ahmad Khan v. Ranbir Singh [1995 Supp (4) SCC 275], Gangabai Gopaldas Mohata v. Fulchand [(1997) 10 SCC 387], Himadri Coke & Petro Ltd. v. Soneko Developers (P) Ltd. [(2005) 12 SCC 364] and Shilpa Shares and Securities v. National Coop. Bank Ltd. [(2007) 12 SCC 165], wherein the same position has been taken. 31. In the light of the above we see no reason to hold that Rules 57 and 58 of the Income Tax Rules are anything but mandatory in nature, so that a breach of the requirements under those Rules will render the auction non est in the eye of the law.” (emphasis added) 1308 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 35.7 In State of Bihar v. Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti,52 referring to Section 34(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, this Court has held that the absence of any consequences for infraction of a procedural provision implies that such a provision ought to be interpreted to be directory and not mandatory. Following are the observations made in the captioned decision : “19. It will thus be seen that Section 34(5) does not deal with the power of the Court to condone the non-compliance thereof. It is imperative to note that the provision is procedural, the object behind which is to dispose of applications under Section 34 expeditiously. One must remember the wise observation contained in Kailash [Kailash v. Nanhku, (2005) 4 SCC 480], where the object of such a provision is only to expedite the hearing and not to scuttle the same. All rules of procedure are the handmaids of justice and if, in advancing the cause of justice, it is made clear that such provision should be construed as directory, then so be it. xxxx 21. Section 80, though a procedural provision, has been held to be mandatory as it is conceived in public interest, the public purpose underlying it being the advancement of justice by giving the Government the opportunity to scrutinise and take immediate action to settle a just claim without driving the person who has issued a notice having to institute a suit involving considerable expenditure and delay.
