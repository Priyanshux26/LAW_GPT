[Para 15.1] Income Tax Act, 1961 – s.80P(4): Held: Sub-section (4) of s.80P in the present form is in the nature of an exception which states that the provisions of s.80P shall apply in relation to any co-operative bank other than a primary agricultural credit society or a primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank – The expressions co-operative bank and primary agricultural credit society as 320 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. well as primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank are defi ned in the Explanation as co-operative bank and primary agricultural credit society having the meanings respectively assigned to them in Part V of the BR Act, 1949 – Banking Regulation Act, 1949. [Para 15.2] Banking Regulation Act, 1949 – ss.5(b), (c), 22, 56(o) – ‘banking company’ – ‘banking’: Held: Banking company in s.5(c) means any company which transacts the business of banking in India – “Banking” is defi ned in s.5(b) to mean the accepting, for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or otherwise, and withdrawal by cheque, draft, or otherwise – Therefore, a banking company must transact banking business vis-à-vis the public – Thus, in the fi rst place a co-operative society must be engaged in banking business as defi ned in s.5(b) – For that, s.22 speaks about licence to be obtained by a bank to do banking business which is modifi ed as per clause (o) of s.56 which states that no cooperative society shall carry on banking business in India unless it is a co-operative bank and holds a licence issued in that behalf by the Reserve Bank, subject to such conditions, if any, as the Reserve Bank may deem fi t to impose – Secondly, a co-operative society must obtain a licence u/s.22, only if it functions as a co-operative bank and not otherwise – Thus, a co-operative society including a co-operative credit society which is not a co-operative bank does not require a licence to function as such. [Para 15.4] Banking Regulation Act, 1949 – ss.5(b), 56(c)(i)(cci): Held: If a co-operative society is not conducting the business of banking as defi ned in clause (b) of s.5, BR Act, 1949, it would not be a co- operative bank and not so within the meanings of a state co-operative bank, a central co-operative bank or a primary co-operative bank in terms of s.56(c) (i)(cci) – Whereas a co-operative bank is in the nature of a banking company which transacts the business of banking as defi ned in clause (b) of s.5 of the BR Act, 1949 – National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development Act, 1981 – ss.2(d), (u), (v)-(x). [Para 15.8] Income Tax Act, 1961 – s.80P(4) – Object and purpose – Discussed. Banking Regulation Act, 1949 – s.56 – Object: KSCARDB v. THE ASSESSING OFFICER, TRIVANDRUM 321 AND ORS. Held: Having regard to the Explanation to sub-section (4) of s.80P, it is necessary to consider Chapter V of the BR Act, 1949 which states that the said Act shall apply to co-operative societies subject to modifi cations made thereunder – s.56 begins with a non-obstante clause which states that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the provisions of the said Act, shall apply to, or in relation to, co- operative societies as they apply to, or in relation to, banking companies subject to certain modifi cations – The object of s.56 is to provide a deeming fi ction by equating a co-operative society to a banking company if it is a co-operative bank within the meaning of the said provision – This is because Chapter V of the BR Act, 1949, deals with application of the Chapter to co-operative societies which are co-operative banks within the meaning of the said chapter – For the purpose of these cases, what is relevant is that throughout the BR Act, 1949, unless the context otherwise requires, references to a “banking company” or “the company” or “such company” shall be construed as references to a co-operative bank – Therefore, while considering the meaning of a co-operative bank inherently, such a cooperative society must be a banking company then only it would be construed as a co-operative bank requiring a licence u/s.22 of BR Act, 1949 in to function as such a bank – Income Tax Act, 1961 – s.80P(4).
