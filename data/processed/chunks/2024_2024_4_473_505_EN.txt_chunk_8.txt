Clause 29.5.1 of the agreement shows that the termination ought to have been effected after 90 days from the cure notice plus 90 days in addition. Termination was thus effective only on 07 January 2013 and on this date, none of the defects were pending to be rectified by DMRC; 19 The 2002 Act 486 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 28.4. The sanction/certificate granted by CMRS was issued on a joint application by both the parties after thorough inspection of the operations. The terms of the agreement and the provisions relating to the CMRS process under the 2002 Act are intrinsically connected; 28.5. The Tribunal should have considered the binding effect of the CMRS sanction as the issue of speed was neither raised, nor deliberated before it and was irrelevant to the termination; 28.6. The line has been running since 1 July 2013. The speed of operations was sanctioned at 50kmph, and has been progressively increased to 60 kmph in January 2013, 80 kmph in August 2013, 90 kmph in July 2019, and ultimately 100 kmph and then 110 kmph in 2023. The metro was running at 80 kmph prior to the termination of the agreement. It is currently running at 120kmph for which a fresh sanction was obtained from the CMRS. The smooth operation of the metro line for five and a half years, until the date of the award was entirely ignored by the Tribunal, making the award perverse; 28.7. The running of the metro line shows that even if there were defects, they did not render the metro unviable nor did they interfere with DAMEPL’s obligations under the agreement. Thus, the award is perverse and patently illegal; 28.8. The tribunal ignored vital evidence, warranting the High Court’s interference under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. The miscarriage of justice principle is informed by the scheme of the Arbitration Act; 28.9. The High Court’s interference with the patent illegality was justified and this Court under Article 136 ought to have been slow to interfere with the decision of the Division Bench of the high Court. Miscarriage of justice in terms of the decision in Rupa Hurra vs. Ashok Hurra20 is linked with patent illegality. The High Court’s interference under Section 37 was justified because the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 34 was erroneous; and 28.10. The issue of the fitness of the line was a matter falling under the 2002 Act under which the Commissioner was the final 20 [2002] 2 SCR 1006 : 2002 4 SCC 388 [2024] 4 S.C.R. 487 Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v. Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. authority to decide on the safety of the metro. The certificate could not have been substituted by the Tribunal’s finding on safety of the line. 29. We have heard Mr Harish Salve, Mr Kapil Sibal, Mr JJ Bhatt and Mr Prateek Seksaria, learned senior counsel for the respondent. They have made the following submissions: 29.1. The curative petition is not maintainable as this Court cannot revisit the conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal; 29.2.
