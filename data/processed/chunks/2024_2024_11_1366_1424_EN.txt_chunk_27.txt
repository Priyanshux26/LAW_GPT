He cannot commit breach of the trust reposed in him by the people.” 29 [1996] Supp. 9 SCR 296 : (1996) 6 SCC 530 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1405 State of Andhra Pradesh and Others v. Dr. Rao, V.B.J. Chelikani and Others 45. In Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of Uttar Pradesh,30 this Court unequivocally rejected the argument of absolute discretion of the administrative authorities and immunity of their action from judicial review. The Court observed: “21. … In our opinion, it would be alien to the constitutional scheme to accept the argument of exclusion of Article 14 in contractual matters. The scope and permissible grounds of judicial review in such matters and the relief which may be available are different matters but that does not justify the view of its total exclusion. This is more so when the modern trend is also to examine the unreasonableness of a term in such contracts where the bargaining power is unequal so that these are not negotiated contracts but standard form contracts between unequals. xx xx xx 29. It can no longer be doubted at this point of time that Article 14 of the Constitution of India applies also to matters of governmental policy and if the policy or any action of the Government, even in contractual matters, fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness, it would be unconstitutional.” (emphasis supplied) 46. Thus, time and again, this Court has held that while the power to distribute and redistribute public assets and resources lie within the State’s discretion, such discretion is not absolute. Article 14 and the logic of equality impose fetters on the exercise of this discretionary power. Therefore, it cannot be questioned or contested that state policy and executive action must satisfy the rigours of Article 14. 47. This leads us to the subsequent inquiry – how do we ascertain whether a State policy or executive action has violated the fetters imposed by Article 14? In other words, what are the tests applicable to evaluate the legality of State conduct in terms of Article 14? Do GoM Nos. 243 and 244 dated 28.02.2005; GoM Nos. 420, 422-425 dated 25.03.2008 and GoM No. 551 dated 27.03.2008 pass the constitutional muster? 30 [1990] Supp. 1 SCR 625 : (1991) 1 SCC 212 1406 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 48. The test of reasonable classification, developed several decades ago, continues to be a dominant test permeating our constitutional discourse. It consists of two prongs: (i) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others that are left out of the group; and (ii) the differentia must have a rational relation with the object sought to be achieved by the statute/policy in question. 49. Referring to the two-fold classification test, a Constitution Bench of this Court in Subramanian Swamy v. Director, Central Bureau of Investigation,31 emphasised that there must be a nexus between the basis of the classification and the object of the legislation/ policy under consideration.
