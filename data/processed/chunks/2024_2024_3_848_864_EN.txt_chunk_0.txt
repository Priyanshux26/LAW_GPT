Justice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg (Raj Rani Jain) and Others receive the pension payable either under Part I or Part III of the First Schedule of the Act – Service which is rendered as a High Court Judge has to be cumulated with the service rendered as a member of the District Judiciary by treating it as service therein for computing the pension – s.14 not applicable as contended by the Appellant-Union of India – Explanation to s. 14 is exhaustive and it applies to a Judge who has not held any pensionable post either in the Union or the State or a person who having held a pensionable post has opted to receive the benefits of pension under Part I of the First Schedule – The Respondent who has not opted to receive the benefits of pension under Part I of the First Schedule would fall outside the purview of Explanation to s. 14 – Post-retiral pension to such a Judge would be governed by s.15 r/w Para 2 of the Part III of the First Schedule – Contention of the Appellant-Union of India that the Respondent has not completed twelve years as High Court Judge does not apply in view of s.14A which entitles a member of the Bar elevated as High Court Judge to the addition of ten years of service – A similar principle, as applicable to Judges appointed from the Bar, must be applied for computing the pension of a member of the District Judiciary, who is appointed to the High Court – Any other interpretation would result in plain discrimination between Judges of the High Court based on the source from which they have been drawn – Break in service must necessarily have no adverse implications in computing the pension of the Respondent for the reason that her service upon appointment as a High Court Judge was in pursuance of a recommendation which was made during her tenure as a judge of the District Judiciary.
