20. We may also note that Bhawna herself claimed that Nimish came to her brother’s wedding in 2012, but she has no details to off er with regard to any harassment for dowry being meted out to her by her mother-in-law and her brothers-in-law after 2009. As noted earlier, even for that period also, her allegations are mostly general and omnibus in nature, without any specifi c details as to how and when her brothers-in-law and mother-in-law, who lived in diff erent cities altogether, subjected her to harassment for dowry. 21. Most damaging to Bhawna’s case is the fact that she did nothing whatsoever after leaving her matrimonial home in February, 2009, and fi led a complaint in the year 2013 alleging dowry harassment, just before her husband instituted divorce proceedings. 22. Given the totality of the facts and circumstances, we are of the considered opinion that Bhawna’s allegations against the appellants, such as they are, are wholly insuffi cient and, prima facie, do not make out a case against them. Further, they are so farfetched and improbable that no prudent person can conclude that there are suffi cient grounds to proceed ABHISHEK v. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH 519 [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] against them. In eff ect, the case on hand falls squarely in categories (1) and (5) set out in Bhajan Lal (supra). Permitting the criminal process to go on against the appellants in such a situation would, therefore, result in clear and patent injustice. This was a fi t case for the High Court to exercise its inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the FIR and the consequential proceedings. 23. The appeals are accordingly allowed. FIR No. 56 of 2013 and Criminal Case No. 11954 of 2014 pending on the fi le of the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Indore, shall stand quashed insofar as the appellants, Kusum Lata, Abhishek Gour and Sourabh Gour, are concerned. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals allowed. Nidhi Jain
