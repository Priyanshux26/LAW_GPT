Accordingly, the third respondent in W.P. No. 583 of 12 Writ Petition No. 583 of 2011 13 Respondent No. 1 14 Original Application No. 821 of 2007 132 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 2011 was placed in the skilled grade only with effect from 6.1.1999 and third respondent in W.P. No. 584 of 2011 was promoted only with effect from 5.10.1998 whereas the petitioners in both the petitions were promoted to the skilled grade on 3.7.1998. 8. It is not in dispute that the Semi-Skilled grade is only has to complete the probation period satisfactorily and pass the requisite trade tests prescribed for the posts. In the present case, it is clear that due to extension of the probation period, the respondents were placed below the persons who were promoted to Skilled grade earlier than them. Even if the date of appointment is taken into consideration, the petitioners are seniors to the third respondent in these petitions. 9. That apart, the petitioners were promoted to the skilled grade in the year 1998 and to the highly skilled grade in the year 2003. But the third respondent in these petitions have chosen to file the original applications only in the year 2007 and no reason is forthcoming for the delay. 10. In view of the counter affidavit filed by the Department which is in favour of the petitioners and the fact that the petitioners are seniors to the third respondent in these petitions both as per the date of initial appointment and also the date of promotion to the skilled grade, we are of the view that revising the seniority list at the instance of the third respondent in the Writ Petitions in the guise of implementing the of the Tribunal, is illegal. Therefore, in our considered opinion, the of the Tribunal is to be interfered with. 11. For the aforesaid reasons, the writ petitions are allowed and the of the Tribunal is set aside. The respondents 1 and 2 are directed to restore the seniority of the petitioners confirming their original date of promotion to the Highly Skilled Grade. After revising the seniority, the respondents are further directed to consider the case of the petitioners for subsequent promotion on par with their juniors.” (quoted verbatim from the paper book) [2024] 10 S.C.R. 133 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others The dated 10th October, 2011 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is the subject matter of challenge in the instant appeal. Submissions on behalf of the appellant: 11. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant urged that the High Court premised its findings on a totally erroneous reasoning that the challenge laid by the appellant to the draft seniority list was delayed and that the private respondents herein(writ petitioners) were senior to the appellant as on the date of initial appointment. 12. Learned counsel contended that the draft seniority list in the appellant’s cadre was published in the year 2006 for the first time after the appointment of the appellant as well as the private respondents.
