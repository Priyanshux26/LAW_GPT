[…] When the Prohibition of 1950, was purported to be issued on 8th March, 1950, it was not laid down that it was being issued so as to supersede the earlier Prohibition of 1119. If it had been a valid , it would have covered the same field as the Prohibition of 1119, and, consequently, would have been the effective under which the rights and obligations of parties have to be governed. On the other hand, if it be held to be void, this will not have the effect of superseding the earlier of 1119.” 49 [1969] 3 SCR 40 : (1969) 1 SCC 255 : 1968 INSC 335 50 Ibid [4] (Bhargava J). [2024] 11 S.C.R. 69 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. Justice Bhargava observed that even if the 1950 Prohibition was held to be void, the consequence would merely be that the parties would have been governed by the earlier Prohibition 1119. Justice Bhargava held that if the later was found to be void, it would “not have the effect of superseding the earlier .”51 The learned Judge went on to distinguish the decision in ATB Mehtab Majid in the following manner: “7. … Learned counsel for the respondent, however, urged that the Prohibition of 1119, cannot, in any case, be held to have continued after 8th March, 1950, if the principle laid down by this Court in Firm A.T.B. Mehtab Majid & Co. v. State of Madras is applied…. […] 8. On that analogy, it was argued that, if we hold that the Prohibition of 1950, was invalid, the previous Prohibition of 1119, cannot be held to be revived. This argument ignores the distinction between supersession of a rule, and substitution of a rule. In the case of Firm A.T.B. Mehtab Majid & Co., the new Rule 16 was substituted for the old Rule 16. The process of substitution consists of two steps. First, the old rule is made to cease to exist and, next, the new rule is brought into existence in its place. Even if the new rule is invalid, the first step of the old rule ceasing to exist comes into effect, and it was for this reason that the court held that, on declaration of the new rule as invalid, the old rule could not be held to be revived. In the case before us, there was no substitution of the Prohibition of 1950, for the Prohibition of 1119. The Prohibition of 1950, was promulgated independently of the Prohibition of 1119 and because of the provisions of law it would have had the effect of making the Prohibition of 1119 inoperative if it had been a valid . If the Prohibition of 1950 is found to be void ab initio, it could never make the Prohibition of 1119 inoperative.” (emphasis supplied) 51 Ibid [7] (Bhargava J). 70 [2024] 11 S.C.R.
