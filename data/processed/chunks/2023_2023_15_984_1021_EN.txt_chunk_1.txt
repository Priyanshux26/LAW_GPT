[Paras 28-30, 32] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – s.47 r/w Or.XXI – Execution proceedings – Question involving jurisdiction – Availability of opportunity to raise said plea at an earlier point of time – Conduct of party signifi cant: Held: An Executing Court is enjoined with the duty to give eff ect to the decree – Any interference, including on a question involving jurisdiction, should be undertaken very sparsely as a matter of exception – The onus lies heavily on the -debtor to convince the Court that a decree is inexecutable – The conduct of a party assumes signifi cance – If a party is likely to have an undue advantage, despite the availability of an opportunity to raise a plea of lack of jurisdiction at an earlier point of time, it should not be permitted to do so during the execution proceedings – Further, a plaintiff shall not be made to suff er by the passive act of the defendant in submitting to the jurisdiction – One has to see the consequence while taking note of the huge pendency of the cases before various Courts in the country – There is no gainsaying that but for the adverse decree suff ered, a 986 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. -debtor would not have ventured to raise such a plea – It is clearly a case of an afterthought to suit his convenience – He cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate – Though this Court is conscious about the earlier precedents dealing with the stage at which such a plea can be raised, much water has fl own under the bridge in terms of the ground reality – Approbate and Reprobate. [Paras 14, 15] Practice and Procedure – Jurisdiction – Lack of jurisdiction to a forum vis-à-vis a case where two or more forums deal with the same issue along with the rights and liabilities of the parties: Held: There is a subtle diff erence when dealing with a case involving coram non-judice – The principle governing lack of jurisdiction to a forum may diff er from a case where two or more forums deal with the same issue along with the rights and liabilities of the parties – To make the position clear, one has to see as to whether there is any change in the rights and liabilities of the parties by choosing one forum as against the other – In a case involving same rights and liabilities but the question is only with respect to the forum being judicial or quasi-judicial, the issue of jurisdiction would pale into insignifi cance when it is sought to be raised as a last straw at a very belated stage – Therefore, when the process becomes the same for both parties who undertake the said route willingly, the question of jurisdiction cannot be put against each other after it has attained fi nality, unless it is demonstrated that the rights of the party who suff ered the decree are obliterated.
