The quality and degree of interest which each must have in the business of the other may be different; the interest of one in the business of the other may be direct while the interest of the latter in the business of the former may be indirect. After analysing the facts, this Court B came to the conclusion that there was no relationship.” 13. In Detergents India Ltd. (supra), this court examined both parts of the definition in Section 4(4)(c) and observed as follows: “Section 4(4)(c) is in two parts. The first part requires the department to apply a de facto test, whereas the second part C requires the application of a de jure test. “Relative” in the Companies Act, 1956 is defined as follows: ***************** *************** A reading of the definition of “relative” would show that the relative need not be a person who is so associated with the D Assessee that they have mutual interest in each other’s businesses. If that were the case, the expression “relative” in the second part would be otiose inasmuch as a relative would be subsumed within “person” in the first part. Thus, “relatives” would also be “persons” who are so associated E with the Assessee that they have a mutual interest in each other’s businesses. The legislature by application of a de jure test has extended the meaning of “related persons” to include the entire list of relatives per se without more as related persons. Similarly, holding companies and subsidiary companies by virtue of the exercise of control by a holding company over a F subsidiary company are similarly included by application of a de jure test. We have indicated that the Assessee argued that the price paid by Shaw Wallace and Company for the same/similar products as was sold by unrelated entities to it was even lower G than the price paid by Shaw Wallace to Detergents India Ltd. This being the case, it is clear that on facts here there is no “arrangement” between Shaw Wallace and Detergents India Limited to depress a price which is otherwise at arm’s length. Though this fact is pleaded expressly before the Commissioner H 628 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A as pointed out above, the Commissioner’s does not contain any finding based on this fact.” 14. The decision in Commissioner of Central Excise, Aurangabad v. Goodyear South Asia Tyres Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.6 is instructive. The assessee, a JV entity of Goodyear and CEAT (both of B whom had equal share in it), had borrowed substantial sums of money from both Goodyear and CEAT. Later, CEAT transferred its entire shareholding to Goodyear. The revenue alleged that the assessee and Goodyear were related persons, which was negatived by this court: “7. The expression ‘in the business of each other’ clearly C denotes that interest of the two persons have to be mutual, i.e., in each other, in to treat them as related persons. 8. We find from the of the Member Judicial that only on the ground that the two companies had given a loan of Rs.
