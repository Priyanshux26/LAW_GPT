His case was that he should have been given the liberty to be heard as an intervenor before the NCLAT. A Coordinate Bench of this Court entertained that application and held: - “We do believe that this controversy should be resolved by the NCLAT itself i.e. whether on the appellants seeking to withdraw the appeal, there can be any impediment in withdrawal of the appeal and is the NCLAT really required to comment on the merits of the of the NCLT at the behest of an intervener. We further make it clear that we are not expanding the array of parties before the NCLAT as a number of entities seems to have jumped into the picture as the matter has gone on before the Court. We make it clear that only the parties/existing interventionist before the NCLAT will have the right of hearing. In view of the s passed in Civil Appeal No. 9062/2022, this appeal will also to be listed before the Bench presided over by the Chairman. In view thereof, the final picture which would emerge would be before the NCLAT and to that extent the passed by us on 14.11.2022 would be kept in abeyance till the NCLAT resolves the issue.” Again, this was in the nature of a review by the applicant who was a party to the proceeding before the NCLAT. All the appeals before the NCLAT were disposed of without hearing him. The context is entirely different from the one in which the applicant has presently approached this Court. 17. The fourth on which the present applicant relied was passed on 12.08.2022 in the case of Supertech Limited -vs- Emerald [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1041 Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v. Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. & Anr. Court Owner Resident Welfare Association & Ors. [MA No.1918 of 2021 in Civil Appeal No.5041 of 2021]. The Coordinate Bench of this Court granted extension of time, as sought by the applicant therein, in effecting demolition of two building towers which were approved by the Court while disposing of the civil appeal. The power to extend time beyond that fixed by a Court on a legitimate ground is incorporated in Section 148 of the Code. If the time to do something requires to be extended, it would be within the inherent jurisdiction of this Court to go beyond the maximum period of 30 days prescribed in the aforesaid Section, after sufficient reason is shown. Section 112 of the Code itself provides that nothing contained in the Code shall affect the inherent powers of the Supreme Court under Article 136 or any other provision of the Constitution. 18. The fifth referred to by the applicant was passed on 23.07.2021 in the case of Union of India -vs- Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India and Ors. [MA No.83 of 2021 in MA (D) No. 9887 of 2020 in Civil Appeal No.6328-6399 of 2015]. A miscellaneous application had been filed for modification of the content of dated 1st September 2020 passed in M.A.
