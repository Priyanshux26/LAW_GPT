We do not think the principles laid down in Indra Sawhney case [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] for subclassification of Other Backward Classes can be applied as a precedent law for subclassification or sub grouping Scheduled Castes in the Presidential List because that very itself has specifically held that subdivision of Other Backward Classes is not applicable to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This we think is for the obvious reason i.e. the Constitution itself has kept the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes List out of interference by the State Governments.” 67. Justice H.K. Sema, J. concurring with Justice Hegde in E.V. Chinnaiah observed in Paragraph 48 as under: - “48. In Indra Sawhney v. Union of India [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] this Court observed at SCC p. 725 that the discussion of creamy layer is confined to Other Backward Classes only and has no relevance in the case of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.” 68. Justice S.B. Sinha also in his concurring opinion observed in paragraph 76 and 92 as under: - “76. Having regard to the decision of this Court in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] backward class citizens can be classified in four different categories — 1636 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (i) more backward, (ii) backward, (iii) Scheduled Caste, and (iv) Scheduled Tribe. A contention has been raised that in Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] the Court permitted a classification amongst Other Backward Classes and as such there is no reason as to why the said principle shall not be applied to the members of the Scheduled Castes. In Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] itself this Court categorically stated that it was not concerned with the question as regards members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. (SCC para 792 at p. 725) It is relevant to note that Question 5 formulated by Jeevan Reddy, J. was only in relation to the further division in the backward classes into backward and more backward categories. Advisedly, no question was framed as regards division of Scheduled Castes into more backward and backward Scheduled Castes. 92. The impugned Act as also the of the High Court are premised on the observations in Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] that there is no constitutional or legal bar for a State in categorising the backward classes as backward and more backward class. This Court, however, while referring to Article 16(4) of the Constitution stated that it recognised only one class viz. backward class of citizens in the following terms: (SCC p. 716, para 781) “781.
