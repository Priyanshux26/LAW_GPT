v. NASYAM JAMAL 597 SAHEB & ORS. [M. R. SHAH, J.] of land measuring 58 cents for a valid sale consideration. Since 2010, A the appellants are in possession of the land purchased vide registered sale deed dated 24.08.2010. Without challenging partition deed dated 11.03.1953 and even subsequent gift deed dated 24.01.1968, the plaintiffs have instituted the present suit with the aforesaid prayers which is nothing but a clever drafting to get out of the limitation. If partition deed dated B 11.03.1953 was to be challenged which as such, the plaintiffs are attempting to do virtually, the suit would be hopelessly barred by limitation having being instituted after lapse of 61 years from the partition deed. 5.1 In the case of T. Arivandandam (supra) in paragraph 5 while considering the provision of VII Rule XI, this Court has C observed as under: - “5. We have not the slightest hesitation in condemning the petitioner for the gross abuse of the process of the court repeatedly and unrepentantly resorted to. From the statement of the facts found in the of the High Court, it is perfectly plain that the suit D now pending before the First Munsif’s Court, Bangalore, is a flagrant misuse of the mercies of the law in receiving plaints. The learned Munsif must remember that if on a meaningful — not formal — reading of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, he should exercise his power under 7 Rule 11 CPC taking E care to see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, nip it in the bud at the first hearing by examining the party searchingly under 10 CPC. An activist Judge is the answer to irresponsible law suits.” F 5.2 In the case of Sopan Sukhdeo Sable Vs. Charity Commr., (2004) 3 SCC 137 in paras 11 and 12, this Court has observed and held as under: “11. In ITC Ltd. v. Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal [ITC Ltd. v. Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal, (1998) 2 SCC 70] it was G held that the basic question to be decided while dealing with an application filed under 7 Rule 11 of the Code is whether a real cause of action has been set out in the plaint or something purely illusory has been stated with a view to get out of 7 Rule 11 of the Code. H 598 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 12. The trial court must remember that if on a meaningful and not formal reading of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious and meritless in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, it should exercise the power under 7 Rule 11 of the Code taking care to see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. If clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, it has to be nipped in B the bud at the first hearing by examining the party searchingly under 10 of the Code.
