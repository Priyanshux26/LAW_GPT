A similar approach was adopted by the other experts. On the other hand, the surveyor has examined himself and adduced documents. Further, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the surveyor has made site-visits and the proof of that was part of the pleadings filed before us. 28. The submission that NHAI continuing the contract with respondent nos. 1 and 2 and they have, in fact, completed the contract does not impress us. The continuation of work by respondent nos. 1 and 2 could be due to various reasons. Even if the NHAI’s decision to continue is taken to be a valid economic decision, that by itself cannot be a reason for not applying the applicable clause of the contract if such applicability is otherwise proved by cogent evidence. 29. For the reasons stated above, we are of the opinion that the NCDRC fell into a clear error of law and fact in allowing the consumer complaint for multiple reasons. As we have not agreed with the preliminary objection of the appellant to reject the complaint and relegate the 374 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports respondents to civil court, we made extra efforts to examine the facts in detail. It is for this reason that the evidentiary value of the reports, their scope and ambit, and their contents were examined by us in some detail. 30. For the reasons stated above, we allow the appeal and set-aside the impugned dated 16.01.2023 passed by the NCDRC in Consumer Complaint No. 160 of 2019. 31. Pending applications, if any, shall be disposed of. 32. There shall be no as to costs. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
