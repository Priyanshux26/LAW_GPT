54 of the NDPS Act. [Para 39(vi)] Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 – ss.52A, 37 – The High Court solely on the ground of belated compliance of s.52A of the NDPS Act granted bail to the respondent – Correctness: Held: The High Court without considering as to whether the twin conditions mentioned in clause (b) sub-section (1) of s.37 were fulfilled or not, concluded without any material on record that s.37 was not attracted as there was non-compliance of s.52A of the said Act within reasonable time – The Appellant-NCB having opposed the bail application, it was obligatory on the part of the 1408 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports High Court to record a satisfaction on the cumulative conditions namely, that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the respondent- accused was not guilty of the alleged offences and that he was not likely to commit any offence while on bail, as contemplated in s.37(1)(b) of the said Act – The non-recording of such satisfaction which is mandatory in nature, has rendered the impugned of High Court fallacious and untenable – As far as s.52A is concerned, sub-section (2) of s.52A specifies the procedure as contemplated in sub-section (1) thereof, for the disposal of the seized contraband or controlled narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances – Any deviation or delay in making the application under subsection (2) by the concerned officer to the Magistrate or the delay on the part of the Magistrate in deciding such application could at the most be termed as an irregularity and not an illegality which would nullify or vitiate the entire case of the prosecution – It is settled that an irregularity may be overlooked or corrected without affecting the outcome, whereas an illegality may lead to nullification of the proceedings – Also, as per s.54 of the said Act, the courts are entitled to presume, unless and until the contrary is proved that the accused had committed an offence under the Act in respect of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance etc. for the possession of which he failed to account satisfactorily – An anomalous situation would arise if a non-compliance or delayed compliance of s.52A is held to be vitiating the trial or entitling the accused to be released on bail, though he is found to have possessed the contraband substance, and even if the statutory presumption is not rebutted by him – Such could not be the intention of the legislature – Thus, the impugned based on the inferences and surmises, in utter disregard of the statutory provision of the Act and in utter disregard of the mandate contained in s.37 of the Act, and granting bail to the accused merely on the ground that the compliance of s.52A was not done within reasonable time, is highly erroneous and deserves to be quashed and set aside.
