Royappa v. State of T.N24, where the Court while dealing with an allegedly discriminatory transfer noted as under: “85…….From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14, and if it effects any matter relating to public employment, it is also violative of Article 16. Articles 14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in State action and ensure fairness and equality of treatment. They require that State action must 23 Shayara Bano v Union of India 2017(9) SCC 1; Joseph Shine v Union of India (2019) 3 SCC 39; Lok Prahari v State of UP [Para 30,35,36,39] (2016) 8 SCC 389 24 [1974] 2 SCR 348 : (1974) 4 SCC 3 568 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports be based on valid relevant principles applicable alike to all similarly situate and it must not be guided by any extraneous or irrelevant considerations because that would be denial of equality. Where the operative reason for State action, as distinguished from motive inducing from the antechamber of the mind, is not legitimate and relevant but is extraneous and outside the area of permissible considerations, it would amount to mala fide exercise of power and that is hit by Articles 14 and 16. Mala fide exercise of power and arbitrariness are different lethal radiations emanating from the same vice: in fact the latter comprehends the former. Both are inhibited by Articles 14 and 16.” 51. Commenting on the principle of non-arbitrariness in the words of Article 14, another five-judge bench speaking through P.N. Bhagwati J. in Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi25, (for short “Ajay Hasia”) made the following pertinent observations: “16. …It must therefore now be taken to be well settled that what Article 14 strikes at is arbitrariness because any [ Under Article 32 of the Constitution] action that is arbitrary, must necessarily involve negation of equality. The doctrine of classification which is evolved by the courts is not paraphrase of Article 14 nor is it the objective and end of that article. It is merely a judicial formula for determining whether the legislative or executive action in question is arbitrary and therefore constituting denial of equality. If the classification is not reasonable and does not satisfy the two conditions referred to above, the impugned legislative or executive action would plainly be arbitrary and the guarantee of equality under Article 14 would be breached. Wherever therefore there is arbitrariness in State action whether it be of the legislature or of the executive or of an “authority” under Article 12, Article 14 immediately springs into action and strikes down such State action. In fact, the concept of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional scheme and is a golden thread which runs through the whole of the fabric of the Constitution.” 25 [1981] 2 SCR 79 : (1981) 1 SCC 722 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
