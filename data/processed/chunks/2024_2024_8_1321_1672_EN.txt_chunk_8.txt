[Para 84(ii)] 3. The reservation, if any, has to be limited only for the first generation or one generation and if any generation in the family has taken advantage of the reservation and have achieved higher status, the benefit of reservation would not be logically available to the second generation. [Para 84(iii)] 1332 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 4. Periodical exercise has to be undertaken to exclude the class of person who after taking advantage of reservation has come to march, shoulder to shoulder with the general category. [Para 84(iv)] Held (per Satish Chandra Sharma, J.) (Concurring): On the question of applicability of the ‘creamy layer principle’ to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, I find myself in agreement with the view expressed by Justice Gavai i.e., for the full realisation of substantive equality inter se the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the identification of the ‘creamy layer’ qua Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes ought to become a constitutional imperative for the State. [Para 2] Held (per Bela M. Trivedi, J.) (Dissenting): In so far as Article 15(4) and 15(5) are concerned, the use of the word “any” before the words “socially and educationally backward classes” and the use of the word “the” before “Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes” clearly indicate that the said provisions pertain to the “Other Backward Classes” which are socially and educationally backward, and that the said provisions also pertain to the “Scheduled Castes” and “Scheduled Tribes”, however the “Scheduled Castes” do not require any further identification once they are notified under Article 341 – As rightly held in Ashok Kumar Thakur, the “creamy layer” principle is one of the parameters to identify backward classes – The “Scheduled Castes” having already been specified in the Presidential List under Article 341, the said creamy layer principle cannot be applied to the “Scheduled Castes” for their identification as backward class.
