938 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. Therefore, the accused No.2 is discharged for the off ence under Section 13(2) r/w 13(1)(d) of the P.C. Act, in view of the s of the Hon’ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in W.P. No. 33297/16 dt.30.10.2018 and as far as the off ences under Section 120-B, 420, 468 and 471 of IPC are concerned the accused No.2 is liable to be prosecuted along with other accused.” 17. Feeling aggrieved with the aforesaid, the appellant herein went before the High Court by fi ling the Criminal Petition No. 6782 of 2019 with a prayer that he should be discharged from the entire prosecution or to put in other words, he should also be discharged for the off ences under the IPC as there is no sanction accorded by sanctioning authority under Section 197 of the CrPC. 18. The High Court adjudicated the Criminal Petition No. 6782 of 2019, fi led by the appellant herein and by its impugned dated 20.06.2022 rejected the same. 19. The relevant fi ndings recorded by the High Court, while rejecting the petition fi led by the appellant herein reads thus: “23. It is relevant to note that in the dated 30.08.2019 in C.C.No.17 of 2015, the trial Court has specifi cally mentioned that the discharge application vide Crl.M.P.No.519/2015 fi led by the petitioner herein for the IPC off ences is pending. During the course of arguments, the said facts were admitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner herein. Therefore, the petitioner herein cannot pursue parallel remedies. As discussed supra, the Investigating Offi cer has recorded the statements of 65 witnesses under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. and collected 545 documents. On consideration of the same only, he has laid charge sheet against the petitioner and other accused. The contents of the charge sheet constitutes the off ences alleged against the petitioner herein. The defences taken by the petitioner herein cannot be considered in a petition fi led under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. The petitioner herein has to face trial and prove his innocence. 24. In this regard, it is apt to refer to the decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kamal Shivaji Pokarnekar v. The State of Maharashtra (AIR 2019 SC 847), wherein the Apex Court has A. SREENIVASA REDDY v. RAKESH SHARMA AND ANR. 939 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] categorically held that quashing criminal proceedings was called for only in a case where complaint did not disclose any off ence, or was frivolous, vexatious, or oppressive. If allegations set out in complaint did not constitute off ence of which cognizance had been taken by Magistrate, it was open to High Court to quash same. It was not necessary that, a meticulous analysis of case should be done before trial to fi nd out whether case would end in conviction or acquittal. If it appeared on a reading of complaint and consideration of allegations therein, in light of the statement made on oath that the ingredients of the off ence are disclosed, there would be no justifi cation for High Court to interfere.
