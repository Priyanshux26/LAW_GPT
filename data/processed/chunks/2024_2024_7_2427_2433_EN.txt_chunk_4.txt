Once, it has been determined that the Manual of 1987-88 will be relevant for the instant case, it follows that the liability rested on the shoulders of the Respondents to enquire about the status of approval, and they could not have withdrawn from the auction after executing the agreement without bearing its consequences. The said consequences were clearly stated in Clause 2-D of the agreement dated 27.03.1998 and include forfeiture of security amount. 17. There is yet another relevant consideration that we have taken into account while reaching the final decision. It is the fact that in spite of repeated notices by the Appellants calling upon the Respondents to complete the work within a stipulated period, the Respondents failed to come forward and do the needful. Respondents came forward by filing a Writ Petition, only after the communication dated 17.01.2000 forfeiting the security amount. It reflects on the non-diligent and [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2433 Chief Conservator of Forest & Ors. v. Virendra Kumar & Ors. lackadaisical approach adopted by the Respondents which cannot be overlooked by this Court. 18. We thus hold that the security amount deposited by the Respondents rightly deserves to be forfeited by the Appellants. 19. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The impugned dated 11.01.2011 is, hereby, set aside and the notice issued by the Appellants dated 17.01.2000 is upheld as valid. 20. Pending application(s), if any, is/are disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Niti Richhariya, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Abhinav Mukerji, Sr. Adv.)
