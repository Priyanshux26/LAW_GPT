For commencement of proceedings, there must be initiation of proceedings. In other words, initiation of proceedings must precede commencement of proceedings. Without initiation G of proceedings under Chapter XIV, there cannot be commencement of proceedings before a Magistrate under Chapter XVI. The High Court, in our considered view, was not right in equating initiation of proceedings under Chapter XIV with commencement of proceedings under Chapter XVI.” H CARDINAL MAR GEORGE ALENCHERRY v. STATE OF 1027 KERALA & ANR. [BELA M. TRIVEDI, J.] 11. In Ramdev Food Products Private Vs. State of Gujarat2 A while drawing distinction between the provisions contained in Section 156(3) and Section 202(1) of Cr.PC, this Court examined the scheme of the said sections and after discussing various earlier decisions concluded as under:- “38. In Devarapalli Lakshminarayana Reddy v. V. Narayana B Reddy [(1976) 3 SCC 252: 1976 SCC (Cri) 380], National Bank of Oman v. Barakara Abdul Aziz [(2013) 2 SCC 488: (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 731], Madhao v. State of Maharashtra [(2013) 5 SCC 615: (2013) 4 SCC (Cri) 141], Rameshbhai Pandurao Hedau v. State of Gujarat [(2010) 4 SCC 185 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 801] , the scheme of Sections C 156(3) and 202 has been discussed. It was observed that power under Section 156(3) can be invoked by the Magistrate before taking cognizance and was in the nature of pre-emptory reminder or intimation to the police to exercise its plenary power of investigation beginning with Section 156 and ending with report or charge-sheet under Section 173. On the other hand, Section 202 applies at post- cognizance stage and the direction for D investigation was for the purpose of deciding whether there was sufficient ground to proceed.” 12. So far as facts of the present case are concerned, indisputably though the respondent-complainant had filed the first complaint in the court of JMFC, Maradu seeking prayer to direct investigation to the E police under Section 156(3) and 202 of Cr.PC, the said complaint was not prosecuted further. The concerned court had also not directed any investigation either under Section 156(3) or Section 202 of Cr.PC and the said complaint was dismissed for not having been prosecuted further. The Trial Court at Kakkanad, however, before the dismissal of the previous F complaint, had already taken cognizance by issuing summons to the appellant and others in the instant six complaint cases filed by the respondent no. 2 - complainant. 13. Though it is true that the respondent no. 2, in the instant complaints should have disclosed the full and correct facts more particularly with regard to the previous complaint filed by him against G the appellant and other accused in respect of the alleged fraudulent sale of the properties belonging to Archdiocese, mere non-disclosure of such facts, would not be a ground to set aside the summons issued by the Trial Court after applying its mind and having been prima facie satisfied 2 (2015) 6 SCC 439 H 1028 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R.
