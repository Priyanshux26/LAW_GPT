33. Section 71D provided for grant of periodical rest and Section 71E empowered the Central Government to make rules. 34. Section 71F clarifi ed that nothing in Chapter VI-A or the rules made thereunder shall authorize a railway servant to leave his duty where due provision has been made for his relief, until he has been relieved. 35. Section 71G provided for appointment of persons to be Supervisors of Railway Labour and Section 71H provided for penalty to any person under whose authority any railway servant is employed in contravention of any of the provisions of Chapter VI-A or of the rules made thereunder. The relevant provisions of the 1989 Act 36. The 1890 Act was repealed by the 1989 Act. Section 2 (34) as it existed originally defi ned railway servant as: COMMANDING OFFICER, RAILWAY PROTECTION SPECIAL FORCE, 673 MUMBAI v. BHAVNABEN DINSHBHAI BHABHOR & OTHERS [MANOJ MISRA, J.] “railway servant means any person employed by the Central Government or by a railway administration in connection with the service of a railway.” By Act No.51 of 2003, with eff ect from 1.7.2004, the defi nition of railway servant as provided in Section 2 (34) was amended as to read: “railway servant means any person employed by the Central Government or by a railway administration in connection with the service of a railway; including member of the Railway Protection Force appointed under clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957 (23 of 1957)”. (Emphasis supplied) 37. Chapter XIII of the 1989 Act talks about liability of railway administration for death and injury to passengers due to accidents. Section 124 provides for the extent of liability and Section 124A, which was inserted by Act No. 28 of 1994, with eff ect from 01.08.1994, provides for compensation on account of an untoward incident. Section 125 enables fi ling of an application for compensation under Section 124 or Section 124A before the Claims Tribunal. Section 127 provides for determination of compensation by the Claims Tribunal in respect of any injury or loss of goods. Section 2 (3) states that “Claims Tribunal” means the Railway Claims Tribunal established under Section 3 of the Railways Claims Tribunal Act, 1987 (54 of 1987). 38. What is interesting in Sections 124 and 124A of the 1989 Act is the explanation attached thereto. The explanation to Sections 124 and 124-A provides that, for the purposes of the section, “passenger” includes a railway servant on duty. However, Section 128 of the 1989 Act saves the right of any person to claim compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923, or any other law for the time being in force. For reference, Section 128 of the 1989 Act is reproduced below: “128. Saving as to certain rights.- (1) The right of any person to claim compensation under section 124 or section 124A shall not aff ect the right of any such person to recover compensation payable under the Workmen’s Compensation 674 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R.
