Schedule II List of Persons who, subject to the provisions of Section 2 (1) (n), are included in the defi nition of Workmen. “The following persons are workmen within the meaning of Section 2 (1) (n) and subject to the provisions of that section, that is to say, any person who is-- “(i) employed otherwise than in a clerical capacity or on a railway, in connection with the operation, repair or maintenance of a lift or a vehicle propelled by steam or other mechanical power or by electricity or in connection with the loading or unloading of any such vehicle; or xxxxxxxxxxxxx (xii) employed upon a railway as defi ned in clause (31) of Section 2 and sub-section (1) of Section 197 of the Railways Act, 1890 (9 of 1890), either directly or through a sub-contractor, by a person fulfi lling a contract with the railway administration; or (xiii) employed as an inspector, mail guard, sorter or van peon in the Railway Mail Service or as a telegraphist or as a postal or railway signaller, or employed in any occupation ordinarily involving outdoor work in the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department” The relevant provisions of the 1890 Act 27. The provisions of the 1890 Act are relevant because when the 1923 Act was enacted, the 1890 Act was in operation and the defi nition of a “workman” under the 1923 Act makes a reference to a railway servant. Therefore, defi nition of a “railway servant” as it existed in the 1890 Act becomes relevant. Likewise, Section 10 of the 1957 Act makes a reference to the 1890 Act, by stating that offi cers and members of the Force shall for all purposes be regarded as railway servants within the meaning of the 1890 Act other than Chapter VI-A thereof. It would therefore be useful to notice the defi nition of a railway servant as also the provisions of Chapter VI-A of the 1890 Act. 672 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 28. Section 3 (7) of the 1890 Act defi ned railway servant as: “railway servant means any person employed by a railway administration in connection with the service of a railway.” 29. Chapter VI-A of the 1890 Act provided for limitation of employment of railway servants. The said chapter comprised of Sections 71A, 71B, 71C, 71D, 71E, 71F, 71G and 71H. 30. Section 71A, inter alia, provided that unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context: (a) the employment of a railway servant is to be “essentially intermittent” when it has been declared to be so by the authority empowered in this behalf, on the ground that it involves a long period of inaction. 31. Section 71B clarifi ed that Chapter VI-A would apply only to such railway servants or classes of railway servants as the Central Government may, by rules made under Section 71E, prescribe. 32. Section 71C, inter alia, provided that a railway servant, other than a railway servant whose employment is essentially intermittent, shall not be deployed for more than sixty hours a week on the average in a month; whereas a railway servant whose employment is essentially intermittent shall not be deployed for more than eighty-four hours in any week.
