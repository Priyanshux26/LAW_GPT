Briefly, the facts available on record are that respondents No. 1 and 2 filed a suit3 for partition of the ancestral property belonging to their grand father pleading that no actual partition of the property has ever taken place. When the suit was at the fag end, an application was filed by respondents No. 1 and 2 seeking amendment of the plaint. 1 dated 18.08.2010 passed in W.P. No. 82086 of 2010 2 High Court of Karnataka, Circuit Bench at Gulbarga 3 Original Suit No. 151 of 2005 938 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The amendment sought was to add prayer in the suit for a declaration that an earlier compromise decree dated 14.10.2004 was null and void. As prayer was not made earlier, the court fee required thereon was also sought to be affixed. The ground on which the amendment was sought was that due to oversight and mistake, the respondents No. 1 and 2/plaintiffs were unable to seek the relief of declaration. No prejudice as such would be caused to the defendants as limited relief is for fair partition of the ancestral property. The Trial Court4 dismissed the application. However, when the 5 was challenged before the High Court, the same was set aside and the amendment prayed for by the plaintiffs was allowed subject to payment of costs. 3. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that in the case in hand, there was a family partition in Original Suit No. 401 of 2003 filed by Smt.
