M.P. Nos. 99512 of 2021 and 99514 of 2021, we deem it appropriate to observe that so far as the prayers for impleadment in W.P. (Crl.) No. 242 of 2019 and E for directions to the UPSIDC as regards execution of sub-lease deed or tripartite sub-lease deed are concerned, the same being not directly the subject-matter of this transferred case [T. C. (C) No. 82 of 2022], we would prefer leaving those aspects open for consideration at the appropriate stage in the appropriate proceedings. It may, however, be observed that the first prayer in Crl. M.P. No. 99514 of 2021, seeking F directions for converting the subject land from leasehold to freehold, is essentially the relief claimed in this transferred case and shall stand covered by this . In the given status of record, we have, of course, taken into consideration a few documents filed along with these applications, particularly the communications of the petitioner to UPSIDC G for conversion of land from leasehold to freehold. 10. While challenging the impugned rejection dated 24.01.2022, learned senior counsel for the petitioner has referred to the background features relating to the project undertaken by the petitioner on the subject land and has asserted on the rights of the petitioner to get H 1084 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A the benefits ensuing from the said policy of the State Government, including conversion of the subject land from leasehold to freehold. 10.1. With reference to the background facts about two contiguous pieces of land, admeasuring 40505 sq. mtrs. having been leased out to the petitioner under the aforesaid two separate lease deeds dated B 23.08.2006 and dated 30.03.2009, it has been submitted that the petitioner has made operational one combined project, on one part of the subject land, i.e., the portion leased out under the lease deed dated 23.08.2006, in the name and style “Grand Venice Mall”, which is housing several high-end brands. It has also been submitted that the said project is operational since the mid of 2016 inasmuch as undisputed possession C has already been taken by 301 buyers; and out of 220 allottees who have disputes with the petitioner, 97 have settled and the vacant units are awaiting possession by the remaining buyers/investors. 10.2. While assailing the impugned dated 24.01.2022, it has been strenuously argued by the learned senior counsel for petitioner that D the so passed by the Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary Industrial Development Section-4, Uttar Pradesh is devoid of any merit and is contrary to the stand taken by the respondents earlier and, therefore, suffers from grave infirmity and deserves to be set aside. 10.3. With reference to the terms of the policy formulated by the E Government of Uttar Pradesh in the year 2013 for promotion of tourism in the State, it has been submitted that clause 3 of the said policy clearly states that ‘Theme Park/Amusement Park can be established and operated by private sector, PPP or any authority by creating an S.P.V. In such a situation, all the decisions regarding the assessment of the desired land, the selection of the private investor and the F implementation of the project after the selection will be taken by the concerned authority/government body/public undertaking under its own rules.’ Therefore, the mall in question, which is a theme-based mall, is entitled to the benefits ensuing from the said policy for conversion of the land from leasehold to freehold; and the recommendation letter G dated 31.01.2015, was rightly issued by UPSIDC to the Department of Tourism of the Government of Uttar Pradesh, that the project in question be recognized as a tourist destination.
