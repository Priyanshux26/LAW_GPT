[Para 37] Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976 – Scheme – Chapter 5 – Town Planning Schemes – ss.40-76 – Discussed. Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976 – s.45 – Reconstitution of plots – Plaintiffs contended that the 1976 Act does not contemplate a second reduction in the reconstituted plot area: Held: Said argument does not merit acceptance – Section 45 deals with reconstitution of plots – A plot owner who has surrendered his original land for the purposes of the Town Planning Scheme is not even assured of allotment of a reconstituted plot in lieu thereof – In such an event, he is entitled only to compensation – Therefore, there is no guaranteed right vesting in a plot owner who surrendered his land in accordance with the Town Planning Scheme that he would [2024] 6 S.C.R. 597 Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation be allotted another plot of land in lieu thereof, much less, a plot of the same area – It is an admitted fact that, when the plaintiffs’ father surrendered an extent of 19823 sq. yds./16575 sq. mts., he was allotted a lesser extent of 15576 sq. yds./13023 sq. mts in two plots in the original Town Planning Scheme, with a deduction of 21.40% – As there was never any guarantee that a plot owner who surrendered his land pursuant to a Town Planning Scheme would be allotted any land after reconstitution of the plots, the plaintiffs cannot assert any vested right in that regard.
