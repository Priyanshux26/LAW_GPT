Z._____, 4A_115/2003; A.________, v. B.________ Ltd., 4A_376/2008; X.________ v. Y.________ Engineering and Y.________ S.p.A., 4A_450/2013. 732 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. corporate veil, alter ego, and waiver.53 In the recent decision in GE Energy Power Conversion v. Outokumpu Stainless, the US Supreme Court relied on equitable estoppel to hold that a non-signatory can compel arbitration where a signatory is relying on terms of the contract to make its claim against the non-signatory.54 American courts have also relied on implied consent,55 third party benefi ciary,56 and general contractual and agency law principles to hold that a non-signatory is a party.57 32. This comparative perspective makes it clear that a determination of parties to an arbitration agreement that is based on mutual intention can take place without reference to whether the non-signatory is a part of the group of companies. In fact, Bernard Hanotiau, an international arbitration scholar, argues that the award in Dow Chemical has been misinterpreted to give rise to the Group of Companies doctrine. Rather, he emphasises that the real implication of Dow is that it enables us to determine whether a non- signatory is a party by reference to its conduct that refl ects its consent. In this light, he argues that any reference to a group of companies is unnecessary as membership within the same group is not a determinative factor in the inquiry of who is a party to the arbitration agreement.58 33. The conclusions from the above analysis can be succinctly put forth as follows: i. Various jurisdictions use both consensual and non-consensual legal principles to determine whether a non-signatory is a party to an arbitration agreement.59 ii. The Group of Companies doctrine is applied irrespective of the distinct juridical identities of each member of the group when 53 GE Energy Power Conversion France SAS Corp., FKA Converteam SAS v.

The principle is based on mutual intention of all the parties to settle the dispute through arbitration.60 iii. The acceptance of the doctrine is highly contested across jurisdictions. The doctrine was developed in France and is applied there by emphasising mutual consent of the signatory and non-signatory companies.61 iv.
