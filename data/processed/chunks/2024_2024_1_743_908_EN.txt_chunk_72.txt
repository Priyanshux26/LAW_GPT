His second such application before the Gujarat High Court was also dismissed vide dated 13.03.2020. That when the said prisoner filed Writ Petition (Crl.) No.135 of 2022 before this Court, he did not disclose the following facts: (i) that within fourteen days of the dated 17.07.2019, he had approached the Government of Maharashtra vide application dated 01.08.2019; (ii) that the CBI had given a negative recommendation vide its letter dated 14.08.2019; (iii) that the Special Judge (CBI), Mumbai had given a negative recommendation vide his letter dated 03.01.2020; (iv) that the Superintendent of Police, Dahod, Gujarat had given a negative recommendation vide his letter dated 03.02.2020; and, (v) that the District Magistrate, Dahod, Gujarat had given a negative recommendation vide his letter dated 19.02.2020. 35.1. Further, the writ petitioner also made a misleading statement by referring to the dated 05.08.2013 of the Bombay High Court in juxtaposition to the of the Gujarat High Court dated 17.07.2019 to contend that there was a divergent opinion between the two High Courts, which aspect constrained him to file Writ Petition (Crl.) No.135 of 2022 before this Court. That the dated 05.08.2013 passed by the Bombay High Court was dealing with transfer of the convicts in Maharashtra [2024] 1 S.C.R. 847 Bilkis Yakub Rasool v. Union of India & Others jail to their parent State (State of Gujarat) that too, in the year 2013,when the issue of remission did not arise at all. But the said writ petitioner projected as if the two High Courts had contradicted themselves in their s and, therefore, he was constrained to file the writ petition invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution. 35.2. It was contended that on account of the suppression of facts as well as misleading this Court with erroneous facts, the dated 13.05.2022 is vitiated by fraud and is hence a nullity and the same cannot be binding on the parties to the said or to the petitioner Bilkis Bano who, in any case, was not arrayed as a party in the said writ petition. 36. It is necessary to highlight the salient aspects of the passed by this Court in the case of Radheshyam Bhagwandas Shah dated 13.05.2022 in Writ Petition (Crl.) No.135 of 2022. That was a petition filed by one of the convicts, respondent No.3 herein, seeking a direction to consider his application for premature release under the policy dated 09.07.1992 of the State of Gujarat which was existing at the time of his conviction. The relevant pleadings in the said writ petition are extracted as under: “Question of Law: A. Whether the policy dated 9.7.92, which was existing at the time of the conviction will prevail for considering the case of the petitioner for premature release? B. Whether in view of ‘State of Haryana Vs. Jagdish, (2010) 4 SCC 216’, a policy which is more liberal and prevailing would be given preference as compared to the policy which is sought to be made applicable at the time of consideration of the cases of premature release?
