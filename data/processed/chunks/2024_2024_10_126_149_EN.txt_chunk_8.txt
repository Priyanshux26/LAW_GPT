3, 4 and 5 138 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 25. The Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned dated 10th October, 2011 has recorded a categoric finding that even if the date of appointment is taken into consideration, the writ petitioners(private respondents herein) are senior to respondent No.3(appellant herein). This finding seems to be prima facie erroneous because admittedly, the appellant herein was placed at 7th position and the private respondents were placed at the 30th, 31st and 32nd positions in the of merit, as borne out from the record. Further, in writ petition25 filed by the private respondents before the High Court and the counter affidavit filed by the respondents herein before this Court, there is no averment that these respondents were placed above to the appellant at the time of initial appointment. Rather the sole ground taken by the writ petitioners(private respondents herein) to oppose the prayer of the appellant was that the appellant was not able to complete his probation period and pass the trade test on time and thus, he was placed below the private respondents in the draft seniority list. 26. Before we adjudicate upon the issue of inter se seniority amongst the litigating parties, we find it necessary to comment on the appellant’s approach towards filing his claim concerning his promotion in the highly skilled grade. 27. The appellant and the private respondents faced a common selection process and were appointed in the semi-skilled grade in the year 1996. The private respondents herein were promoted to the skilled grade on 11th January, 1998 and further promoted to the highly skilled grade on 20th May, 2003. On the other hand, the appellant was promoted to the skilled grade on 17th July, 1998(after completing his extended probation period of 6 months and clearing the mandatory trade test). Considering that the private respondents were promoted to highly skilled grade in May, 2003, the appellant in the normal course should also have been promoted to highly skilled grade by the end of the year 2003. However, as per the factual matrix, he was promoted to the highly skilled grade after around 5 years i.e. on 26th March, 2008. A tabular chart depicting the date of appointment and the date of promotion to skilled and highly skilled grade is placed below: - 25 Writ Petition No. 583 of 2011 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 139 V.

The appellant never questioned the denial of promotion to the highly skilled grade, till much after the publication of the draft seniority list.
