[Paras 48, 50, 52] Contract – DND Flyway project – Terms opposed to public policy – 'Total Cost of the Project' and its calculation methodology – Dissonance between Art.14 of the Concession Agreement read with the formula vis-à-vis public policy - Doctrine of Severability – Invocation of: Held: Contracts loaded with terms which are so unfair and unreasonable, that they truly baffle this Court, are undoubtedly opposed to public policy and must be adjudged void – The Court is always cautious when determining if a particular contract or action is opposed to public policy, but in doing so, it cannot shirk from its duty and approve helplessly the interpretation of a Statute or a document or of an action which is certain to subvert the societal goals and endanger the public good – To do so, the Court may invoke the Doctrine of Severability and sever the incurable parts of the contract from the whole – The Court can do so only when the rest of the contract can breathe and survive without the aid of its void covenants – The Court must ask itself whether the parties would have agreed to the valid terms of the agreement if they knew that the invalid terms would be removed – In the instant case, the High Court held that Art.14 of the Concession Agreement was perpetual in nature and it entitled NTBCL to recover user fees/ toll indefinitely – Such a clause, therefore, being opposed to public policy was unjust and arbitrary and liable to be severed from the Concession Agreement – There is no error in the analysis undertaken by the High Court – It is evident that, despite approval from various authorities, the formula used was far from [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2003 Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd. v. Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association and Others reasonable – The compounding nature of the formula granted NTBCL the right to collect user fees indefinitely; the absence of a cap on O&M expenses allowed for potential inflation of costs by including extraneous expenditures in the Total Project Cost; and the fixed, unrealistic return rate of 20% ensured that the Total Project Cost would escalate yearly without possibility of adjustment by the parties involved – The method used to calculate the Total Project Cost was fundamentally a mechanism for unjust enrichment by a select few and, as such was rightly deemed to be inherently arbitrary by the High Court – Accordingly, the formula outlined in the Concession Agreement is unreasonable and contravenes Art.14 of the Constitution – Given the extent of manipulation in the instant case, Art.14 of the Concession Agreement, read with the formula, is opposed to public policy and must be cut apart from the Concession Agreement. [Paras 57, 58, 63, 65, 77, 78] Contract – DND Flyway project - Recovery of Total Project Cost and returns – No justification for continued imposition or collection of user fees or tolls upon commuters using the DND Flyway: Held: No person or entity can be allowed to make an undue and unjust profit from public property, at the cost of the public at large – Since NTBCL has recovered the costs of the project and substantial profits thereon by virtue of imposition of user fees/tolls and given the existing position of law, there is no error in the High Court’s and its directions in restraining the imposition and collection of user fees/tolls.
