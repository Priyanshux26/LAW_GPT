In this regard, on perusal of the records we note that the High Court has in fact misdirected itself, has proceeded at a tangent and has therefore erred in its conclusion. 14. As already noted, the facts are almost similar in all four cases and as such for the purpose of narration a perusal of the promissory note dated 25.07.2012 (Annexure P/1) would inter alia record as follows: “…..hereby admit to have availed a loan amount shown above for the purpose of meeting my own family expenses and for higher education of my children by collecting the cash amount of Rs.20,00,000/- (In words: Rupees Twenty Lakhs only) for which I do hereby further agree to pay a monthly interest of Rs.2/- (In words: Rupees Two only) per month and fully understand hereby that I am bound by virtue of the promissory to repay the capital or principal loan amount as well as the agreed payable monthly interest amount within the date of December 2016 by ensuring the total payment to you or any of your assignees as directed by you by taking the payable amount to your home and pay it there...” (emphasis supplied) 15. A perusal of the above-extracted and emphasised portion would indicate that the promise is to repay the principal amount with the interest accrued within December, 2016. Hence, when the respondent had agreed to repay the amount within December, 2016, the cause of action to initiate proceedings to recover the said amount if not paid within December 2016 would arise only in the month of December, 2016. In that light, the limitation would be as provided under Article 34 to the Schedule in the Limitation Act, 1963. For the purpose of easy reference, the same is extracted here below: 422 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. THE SCHEDULE PERIODS OF LIMITATION Description of suit Period of limitation Time from which period begins to run PART II – SUITS RELATING TO CONTRACTS 34. On a bill of exchange Three years When the fixed or promissory note time expires. payable at a fi xed time, after sight or after demand. (emphasis supplied) 16. The provision would indicate that in respect of a promissory note payable at a fi xed time, the period of limitation being three years would begin to run when the fi xed time expires. Therefore, in the instant case, the time would begin to run from the month of December, 2016 and the period of limitation would expire at the end of three years thereto i.e. during December, 2019. In that light, the cheque issued for Rs.10,00,000/- which is the subject matter herein is dated 28.04.2017 which is well within the period of limitation. The complaint in CC No.681 of 2017 was fi led in the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on 11.07.2017. So is the case in the analogous complaints. Therefore, in the instant case not only the amount was a legally recoverable debt which is evident on the face of it, the complaint was also fi led within time.
