It is equally well settled that bail once granted, ought not to be cancelled in a mechanical manner. However, an unreasoned or perverse of bail is always open to interference by the superior Court. If there are serious allegations against the accused, even if he has not misused the bail granted to him, such an can be cancelled by the same Court that has granted the bail. Bail can also be revoked by a superior Court if it transpires that the courts below have ignored the relevant material available on record or not looked into the gravity of the offence or the impact on the society resulting in such an . In P v. State of Madhya Pradesh (supra)10 decided by a three judges bench of this Court [authored by one of us (Hima Kohli, J)] has spelt out the considerations that must weigh with the Court for interfering in an granting bail to an accused under Section 439(1)of the CrPC in the following words: “24. As can be discerned from the above decisions, for cancelling bail once granted, the court must consider whether any supervening circumstances have arisen or the conduct of the accused post grant of bail demonstrates that it is no longer conducive to a fair trial to permit him to retain his freedom by enjoying the concession of bail during trial [Dolat Ram v. State of Haryana, (1995) 1 SCC 349 : 1995 3 [2004] Supp. 3 SCR 584 : (2004) 7 SCC 525 4 (2004) 7 SCC 528 5 [2009] 6 SCR 1030 : (2009) 14 SCC 286 6 [2010] 12 SCR 1165 : (2010) 14 SCC 496 7 [2014] 12 SCR 453 : (2014) 16 SCC 508 8 [2017] 11 SCR 195 : (2018) 12 SCC 129 9 [2019] 14 SCR 529 : (2020) 2 SCC 118 10 [2022] 15 SCR 211 762 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports SCC (Cri) 237]. To put it differently, in ordinary circumstances, this Court would be loathe to interfere with an passed by the court below granting bail but if such an is found to be illegal or perverse or premised on material that is irrelevant, then such an is susceptible to scrutiny and interference by the appellate court.”” (emphasis supplied) 20. In State of Haryana v Dharamraj, 2023 SCC OnLine 1085, speaking through one of us (Ahsanuddin Amanullah, J. ), the Court, while setting aside an of the Punjab and Haryana High Court granting (anticipatory) bail, discussed and reasoned: “7. A foray, albeit brief, into relevant precedents is warranted. This Court considered the factors to guide grant of bail in Ram Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan Singh, (2002) 3 SCC 598 and Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan, (2004) 7 SCC 528. In Prasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee, (2010) 14 SCC 496, the relevant principles were restated thus: ‘9. … It is trite that this Court does not, normally, interfere with an passed by the High Court granting or rejecting bail to the accused. However, it is equally incumbent upon the High Court to exercise its discretion judiciously, cautiously and strictly in compliance with the basic principles laid down in a plethora of decisions of this Court on the point.
