The object is to eliminate any kind of political factors having a play in the matter of the disturbance in the Schedule so published by the President.”169 117. Unless amended in the manner prescribed under Article 341(2), the Presidential List notified under Article 341(1) is conclusive of which community is a Scheduled Caste and must be taken as it is. Article 341(2) prescribes the scope of permissible changes to the List published under Article 341(1) and exclusively vests the power to vary these lists in Parliament. 118. The prohibitions in Articles 341 (1) and 342 (2) are two-fold : first, specification as a Scheduled Caste is circumscribed by the territorial limits of the State or the region, specific to which a particular group has been notified.170 For instance, Entry 23 of Part I of the Scheduled Castes for the State of Andhra Pradesh enumerates: “Godagalli, Godagula (in the districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Vishakhapatanam)”. Hence, the enlisted communities (Godagalli and Godagula) are treated as a Scheduled Caste for the districts named in the entry and not for the entire State. In Marri Chandra Shekar Rao v. Dean, Seth GS Medical College,171 a Constitution Bench of this Court considered whether a member of the Gouda community, recognized as a Scheduled Tribe in Andhra Pradesh, could seek admission to a seat reserved for the Scheduled Tribes in Maharashtra. Answering it in the negative, this Court observed that since the social conditions of caste groups vary across the country, a caste or tribe could not be generalized as a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe for the whole country. It held that the expression “in relation to that State” in Articles 341 (1) and 342(1) 169 Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume 9, page 1636 (17 September 1949) 170 See Constitutional (Scheduled Castes) , 1950 [2,4] 171 [1990] 2 SCR 843 : (1990) 3 SCC 130 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1401 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. could not be rendered redundant by treating a caste specified as a Scheduled Caste in one State to be entitled to the benefits for Scheduled Castes in another State, where it was not so specified.172 In Bir Singh v. Delhi Jal Board,173 one of the issues before this Court was whether the power of the State to make provisions for affirmative action for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under Article 16(4) is impacted by the power of the President under Articles 341(1) and 342(1) of the Constitution. The Constitution Bench held that a State in exercise of its power under Article 16(4), cannot extend the benefits accorded to the Scheduled Castes to a caste which is not enumerated in the Presidential list notified under Article 341(1). The Court held that the enabling provision under Article 16(4) must be harmoniously read with Articles 341 and 342. Therefore, if a statute extends the policy of affirmative action to groups not enumerated specifically with respect to that State/ Union Territory, it would circumvent the mandate of Article 341(2) and would be an impermissible expansion of the List, contrary to the mandate of Article 341(1).174 Thus, this Court held that the benefit of reservation cannot be extended to a caste which is not enumerated as a Scheduled Caste in that State, though it finds a place in the Presidential List with respect to another State.
