16. In support of the aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the following case law: (i) Fakhrey Alam v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 2021 SCC OnLine 532 F (ii) Abdul Azeez P.V. and Others v. National Investigation Agency, (2014) 16 SCC 543 (iii) Chitra Ramkrishna v. Central Bureau of Investigation, (2022) SCC OnLine Del 3124 G (iv) Rambhai Nathabhai Gadhvi and Others v. State of Gujarat,(1997) 7 SCC 744 (v) Ashrafkhan v. State of Gujarat, (2012) 11 SCC 606 (vi) Bikramjit Singh v. State of Punjab, (2020) 10 SCC 616 H 18 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 17. In such circumstances referred to above, both the learned counsel prayed that there being merit in their appeals, those may be allowed and the accused persons be ed to be released on default bail. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE NIA/UNION OF B INDIA 18. Mr. Sanjay Jain, the learned ASG, on the other hand, while vehemently opposing both the appeals submitted that it is settled law that the indefeasible right under Section 167(2) of the CrPC accrues to an accused only if the chargesheet is not filed within the time prescribed C therein or within the time extended by a competent court under a special statute. He would submit that the right ceases to be available if the chargesheet is filed within the time indicated above or if the chargesheet is filed prior to preferring an application under Section 167(2) of the CrPC. Mr. Jain sought to fortify his submission by placing reliance on the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in the case of Sanjay Dutt D v. State reported in (1994) 5 SCC 410 (paras 48 and 53(2)(b)) and in the case of Serious Fraud Investigation Office v. Rahul Modi and Others reported in (2022) SCC OnLine 153 (para 16). 19. Mr. Jain vehemently submitted that there is no merit in the submission canvassed on behalf of the accused persons that a chargesheet E without requisite sanction under the UAPA or the 1908 Act is incomplete. In other words, according to Mr. Jain, there is no merit in the contention canvassed on behalf of the accused persons that although the chargesheet was filed within the period of 180 days, yet the same being without sanction, it could be said to be as good as not filing the chargesheet within the statutory time period. F 20. In the aforesaid context, Mr. Jain invited the attention of this Court to the following aspects: a. The act of grant of sanction for prosecution, in several statutes, is entrusted upon an authority other than the Investigating Agency and G as such it is not within the domain of the Investigating Agency to grant such Sanction. b. In the present case, at the time of filing of the first chargesheet by the State Investigating Agency (SIA), the SIA had already sought sanction for prosecution from the appropriate Governments.
