This clause is materially diff erent from Clause 25(viii), which, as we have LOMBARDI ENGINEERING LTD. v. UTTARAKHAND JAL 979 VIDYUT NIGAM LTD. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] seen, makes it clear that in all cases the deposit is to be 10 per cent of the amount claimed and that refund can only be in proportion to the amount awarded with respect to the amount claimed, the balance being forfeited and paid to the other party, even though that other party may have lost the case. This being so, this is wholly distinguishable and does not apply at all to the facts of the present case.” (Emphasis supplied) 63. In para 16 of ICOMM Tele Limited (supra), the court ultimately considered whether Clause 25(viii) could be said to be arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Para 16 reads thus: “16. Thus, it must be seen as to whether the aforesaid Clause 25(viii) can be said to be arbitrary or discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.” 64. Thereafter, the Court proceeded to observe that Clause 25(viii) therein could not be said to be discriminatory as the same applied equally to both the parties, however, arbitrariness could be said to be a separate and distinct facet of Article 14 of the Constitution. Saying so, the Court referred to and relied upon para 19 of this Court’s decision in A.L. Kalra v. Project and Equipment Corporation of India Ltd. reported in (1984) 3 SCC 316. Para 19 reads thus: “19. The scope and ambit of Article 14 have been the subject-matter of a catena of decisions. One facet of Article 14 which has been noticed in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu [(1974) 2 SCR 348 : (1974) 4 SCC 3 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 165 : AIR 1974 SC 555 : (1974) 1 LLJ 172] deserves special mention because that eff ectively answers the contention of Mr Sinha. The Constitution Bench speaking through Bhagwati, J. in a concurring in Royappa case [(1974) 2 SCR 348 : (1974) 4 SCC 3 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 165 : AIR 1974 SC 555 : (1974) 1 LLJ 172] observed as under: [SCC para 85, p. 38: SCC (L&S) p. 200] “The basic principle which, therefore, informs both Articles 14 and 16 is equality and inhibition against discrimination. Now, what is the content and reach of this great equalising principle? 980 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. It is a founding faith, to use the words of Bose, J., “a way of life”, and it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach. We cannot countenance any attempt to truncate its all- embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be “cribbed, cabined and confi ned” within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch.
