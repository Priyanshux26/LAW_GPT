[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1085 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 regional aspirations, political needs, and state-specific requirements. The Assam Accord, along with the introduction of Section 6A, is not the only instance of such political compromises. Historical records document numerous occurrences, such as Article 371A of the Constitution, which was inserted pursuant to the agreement between the Government of India and leaders of the Naga Peoples Convention.145 Similarly, Article 371G was incorporated pursuant to a memorandum of settlement between the Government of India, the Government of Mizoram and the Mizo National Front.146 Identical is the basis of Article 332(6), which was based on the agreement between the governments of India and Assam and the Bodo Liberation Tigers.147 These agreements and provisions are based on asymmetric federalism, recognizing that different States may have unique circumstances and requiring differentiated treatment. 193. Moreover, this conclusion is also supported by various decisions of this Court, which have held that based on the unique historical circumstances of each State, the States may be grouped under different classes for the purpose of reasonable classification under Article 14.148 194. We thus do not find any fault with the government, nor do we dictate that similar agreements should have been made with other States when Parliament entered into a political agreement with Assam alone based on its unique historical situation. 196. As against these considerations, the Petitioners have not been able to conclusively establish that other States were similarly placed. It is an established principle of law that there exists a presumption of constitutionality that underpins legislative enactments unless proven otherwise.149 With respect to Article 14 specifically, this Court has dismissed claims pertaining to discrimination when insufficient material was presented to support the claim.150 It has been repeatedly held that to succeed with a claim under Article 14, a mere plea regarding 145 The Constitution (Thirteenth) Amendment Bill, 1962, Statement of Objects and Reasons. 146 The Constitution (Fifty-Third) Amendment Bill, 1986, Statement of Objects and Reasons. 147 The Constitution (Ninetieth) Amendment Bill, 2003, Statement of Objects and Reasons. 148 Ram Krishna Dalmia v. S.R. Tendolkar, 1958 SCC OnLine SC 6, para 11; Gopi Chand v. Delhi Administration, 1959 SCC OnLine SC 29, para 11. 149 Id. ; Mohd. Hanif Quareshi v. State of Bihar, 1957 SCC OnLine SC 17, para 15. 150 Bhagwati Saran v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1961 SCC OnLine SC 170, para 15. 1086 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports differential treatment is insufficient, and the Petitioner must show that similarly placed classes were discriminated against unjustifiably.151 197. While Mr. Divan, learned Senior Counsel representing the Petitioners, argued that the burden would shift unto the State once the Petitioners established prima facie evidence of unequal treatment, this shift primarily occurs when the classification is ex facie arbitrary, such that the unjust discrimination is so apparent that no proof is required.152 In such circumstances, the onus must shift because the claimant cannot be burdened to disprove the absence of reasons when there are none.
