560 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (k) Enexio claimed that successful operation of the vacuum pump was carried out on 21 May 2015, which implies commissioning of the ACC unit. In response OPG asserted that three components of the ACC unit were defective. (l) On 2 July 2015, OPG issued a debit note towards modifications to the turbine generator building. Thereafter, on 24 August 2015, OPG issued two debit notes: (i) towards work related to lifting of the vertical duct; and (ii) towards liquidated damages permissible under the Supply Purchase and Erection Purchase for the delay in execution. (m) On 28 August 2015 Enexio wrote to OPG questioning the debit notes. (n) On 21 September 2015 Enexio informed OPG that the turbine generator was running at full load and, thereby, requested OPG to arrange for Performance Guarantee Test (PG Test). This request was repeated by e-mails dated 3 October 2015 and 8 October 2015. Later, on 9 October 2015, Enexio sent a letter to OPG attaching six protocols confirming commissioning of all relevant segments of the project. Not only that, on 20 October 2015, Enexio sent a procedure for the PG Test. But the PG Test was not undertaken. (o) On 12 January 2016, OPG issued debit note against OPG’s account for customs duty. (p) On 22 August 2016 OPG informed Enexio that fan assembly had detached. On 20 January 2017 Enexio sent an e-mail to OPG, saying: “Sir, This is further to our visit to your site on 7/1/2016. Considering the time availability and on the interest of closing the issue, we suggest the following: 1. Using in-situ machining agency, the shaft dia variation can be machined out after dismantling the hub and blade assembly alone. Gearbox will not be disturbed at all. We already obtained offer for this. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 561 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. 2. To match the machined out shaft dia and key way, existing fan hub bore and key way can be rebuild and machined after machining out existing bore by 5mm. 3. To start the work, the spare gearbox supplied by us at free of cost can be used and remaining seven gear boxes can be attended one or two at a time. 4. You being a valuable customer to us, we wish to execute the correction work even though this failure happened after our guarantee. We will depute our engineer to site for entire work. 5. But we could not bear the commercial implications since we already suffered loss and our money is also locked up in this project due to various reasons cited in our various earlier letters. 6. Hence, we request you to pay the correction cost and not to deduct the same from us. We request you for above proposal.” (q) On 2 March 2017 Enexio requested OPG to provide certificates for completion of Gummudipoondi as well as Gujarat project. The format of the desired certificate was sent by Enexio to OPG.
