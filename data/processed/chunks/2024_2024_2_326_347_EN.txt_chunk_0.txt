[2024] 2 S.C.R. 326 : 2024 INSC 109 Vasantha (Dead) Thr. Lr. v. Rajalakshmi @ Rajam (Dead) Thr.Lrs. (Civil Appeal No. 3854 of 2014) 13 February 2024 [Hrishikesh Roy and Sanjay Karol*, JJ.] Issue for Consideration The action that set in motion the instant dispute was in the year 1947, when a mother ‘T’ transferred property by executing First Settlement Deed in one form to her two sons and in another, to her daughter. Some forty-odd years later, the daughter’s husband ‘G’ filed a suit in respect of such property, in 1993. The issues arise for consideration are (i) Whether G’s suit for declaration based on the First Settlement Deed, eventually filed in the year 1993 barred by limitation; (ii) Whether the suit for declaration simpliciter was maintainable in view of s.34 of the SRA, 1963. Headnotes Limitation Act, 1963 – s.27, Arts.58 and 65 – Specific Relief Act, 1963 – s.34 – After First Settlement Deed, two sons of T executed a second settlement deed dated 31.07.1952 reverting the interest in properties back to their mother-T – Thereafter, T executed a third Settlement Deed dated 18.08.1952 bequeathing absolute interest in such properties only in favour of two sons – G filed a suit praying for a declaration as owner of the property as sole heir of T’s daughter in terms of First Settlement Deed – Trial Court held that G admitted execution of Second Settlement Deed and possession was handed over to T – The suit filed was barred by limitation – First Appellate Court confirmed the trial Court – However, the High Court held that G was entitled to half share a property according to the First Settlement Deed – Propriety: Held: If the period of limitation is to run from the date of the Second Settlement Deed, then the rights should be extinguished in 1964 – If the same were to run from either 1974 (when M, younger son * Author [2024] 2 S.C.R. 327 Vasantha (Dead) Thr.

Rajalakshmi @ Rajam (Dead) Thr.Lrs. of T executed settlement deed in favour of his adopted daughter V) or 1976 (when another deed was executed by M in favour of his wife P), then after 1986 or 1988 respectively, G had no right in the property on the plea of adverse possession – It is settled that a reversioner ordinarily must file a suit for possession within 12 years from the death of the limited heir or widow – That metric being applied to the instant facts, it is after the death of P, that the reversioner, or in this case the heir of the reversioner G ought to have filed the suit – The suit, the subject matter of appeal before this Court is a suit for declaration simpliciter and not possession – So, the possession still rests with heir of P – The 12 year period expired in 2016 with death of P in the year 2004 – Therefore, the suit filed in 1993 is barred by limitation – Also, Part III of the Schedule to the Limitation Act details the time period within which the declarations may be sought for – Art.58 of the Limitation Act governs the present dispute – In the instant case, the suit for declaration was filed in 1993 – This implies that the cause of action to seek any other declaration i.e.
