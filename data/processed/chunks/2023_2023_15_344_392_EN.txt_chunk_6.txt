We would also like to reproduce Rule 3 of the Rules10, interpretation of which is pivotal for the decision: “3. Requirements of Captive Generating Plant.—(1) No power plant shall qualify as a ‘captive generating plant’ under Section 9 read with clause (8) of Section 2 of the Act unless— (a) in case of a power plant— (i) not less than twenty-six per cent of the ownership is held by the captive user(s); and (ii) not less than fi fty-one per cent of the aggregate electricity generated in such plant, determined on an annual basis, is consumed for the captive use: Provided that in case of power plant set up by registered cooperative society, the conditions mentioned under paragraphs at (i) and (ii) above shall be satisfi ed collectively by the members of the co-operative society: 10 As amended upto 01.09.2023. 354 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Provided further that in case of association of persons, the captive user(s) shall hold not less than twenty-six per cent of the ownership of the plant in aggregate and such captive user(s) shall consume not less than fi fty-one per cent of the electricity generated, determined on an annual basis, in proportion to their shares in ownership of the power plant within a variation not exceeding ten per cent; (b) in case of a generating station owned by a company formed as special purpose vehicle for such generating station, a unit or units of such generating station identifi ed for captive use and not the entire generating station satisfy(ies) the conditions contained in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of sub-clause (a) above including— Explanation.—(1) The electricity required to be consumed by captive users shall be determined with reference to such generating unit or units in aggregate identifi ed for captive use and not with reference to generating station as a whole; and (2) The equity shares to be held by the captive user(s) in the generating station shall not be less than twenty-six per cent of the proportionate of the equity of the company related to the generating unit or units identifi ed as the captive generating plant. Illustration.—In a generating station with two units of 50 MW each namely Units A and B, one unit of 50 MW namely Unit A may be identifi ed as the Captive Generating Plant. The captive users shall hold not less than thirteen per cent of the equity shares in the company (being the twenty-six per cent proportionate to Unit A of 50 MW) and not less than fi fty-one per cent of the electricity generated in Unit A determined on an annual basis is to be consumed by the captive users. (2) It shall be the obligation of the captive users to ensure that the consumption by the Captive Users at the percentages mentioned in sub-clauses (a) and (b) of sub-rule (1) above is maintained and in case the minimum percentage of captive use is not complied with in any year, the entire electricity generated shall be treated as if it is a supply of electricity by a generating company.
