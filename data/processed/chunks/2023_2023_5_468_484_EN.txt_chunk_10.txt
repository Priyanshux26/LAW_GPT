Undisputedly, in the case of Energy Watchdog (supra) as well as in Adani Rajasthan case (supra) this Court has held that B on account of the Change in Law, the generating companies were entitled to compensation so as to restore the party to the same economic position as if such Change in Law had not occurred. Had the Change in Law not occurred, the generating companies would have been entitled to the supply as assured by the CIL/ C Coal Companies under the FSA.” 46. We are, therefore, of the considered view that no error could be found with the concurrent findings that AP(M)L was entitled to Change in Law relief for 100% of the contracted capacity i.e. 1386 MW, which is 70% of the installed capacity of 1980 MW of the Phase IV extension D of Mundra Project. In other words, the finding of the CERC and the learned APTEL is to the effect that AP(M)L would not be entitled to any benefit of Change in Law beyond 70% of the installed capacity i.e. 1386 MW. The said findings cannot be said to not be based on the material on record, or based on extraneous considerations. E 47. We are now left with the second issue with regard to methodology. 48. The grievance of Haryana Utilities is that the methodology for granting benefit on account of the Change in Law adopted by the CERC and affirmed by the learned APTEL is contrary to the one F which was previously arrived at in the earlier cases of GMR, DB Power etc. 49. Perusal of the passed by the learned APTEL would reveal that AP(M)L had proposed a methodology based on the methodology approved by the CERC in the GMR Kamalanga Energy G Limited and Another v. Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited and Others5 considering the quoted tariff under the PPAs as the base. H 5 Petition No. 79/MP/2013 dated 03.02.2016 UTTAR HARYANA BIJLI VITRAN NIGAM LTD. v. S ADANI 483 POWER (MUNDRA) LIMITED [B. R. GAVAI, J.] 50. The learned APTEL had referred to the Record of Proceedings A of the CERC dated 10th August, 2017, which read thus: “3. In response to the Commission’s query as to whether the methodology adopted by the Petitioner in the light of the methodology given in GMR case is acceptable to the Haryana Utilities, learned counsel replied in the positive.” B 51. The learned APTEL had also referred to the of the CERC dated 28th September 2017 in I.A. No.57 of 2017 in Petition No.97/MP/2017, which reads thus: “7…… Haryana Utilities who is the only respondent has not objected to the calculation made by the Applicant.” C 52. The learned APTEL had also referred to the dated 3rd December 2018 passed by the CERC in Review Petition bearing No.24/ RP/2018, which reads thus: “25... It is apparent from the above that the Commission, after D due consideration of the submissions of the Adani Power and Prayas had consciously decided on the methodology for computation of relief due to shortage of domestic coal under change in law for the period from 1.4.2013 to 31.3.2017 in Para 46 of the impugned .
