150 Crore furnished by the SRA – Impugned set aside. [Paras 90, 186, 187, 188] 2. The nature of the Conditions Precedent laid out under the Resolution Plan were such that several of them could not be fulfilled before the operationalization of the Corporate Debtor – The assertion that the Effective Date would kick in only upon fulfilment of all the Conditions Precedent and since the Appellants had challenged the fulfilment of the Conditions Precedent, such a date could not be said to have yet arrived not accepted – It was repeatedly declared by different fora that the Effective Date was frozen on 20.05.2022 and the obligation of the SRA to implement the Resolution Plan was absolute – All steps necessary should have been undertaken by the SRA, at least post the impugned of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2024 – To contend that its hands were tied since the Conditions Precedent were still being challenged before this Court is nothing but a reflection of the mala fide intention on the part of the SRA to not fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Resolution Plan under the garb of pendency of litigation. [Paras 97, 98] [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2041 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. 3. The Effective Date was frozen on 20.05.2022 – As per Clause 6.3.1(g) on the “Infusion of Funds and Timelines”, and Serial No.11 under Clause 7.7, the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore had to be made by the SRA, upfront, within a period of 180 days from the Effective Date – As per the Resolution Plan, this 180-day timeline otherwise would have expired on 16.11.2022 – Several extensions were granted to the SRA to infuse this amount, at different stages of this litigation, by the NCLT, the NCLAT and this Court (vide dtd.18.01.2024, 180 days time for infusion was extended up to 31.01.2024) as well. [Para 98] 4. Further, an adjustment of the PBG against the first tranche payment was also in violation of Regulation 36B(4A) of the 2016 Regulations – The PBG had to be kept alive until the complete implementation of the Resolution Plan as per Regulation 36B(4A) – This was also provided under Clauses 3.13.2 and 3.13.8 of the RFRP (Request for Resolution Plan) respectively wherein the PBG was required to be kept alive and was to be returned to the SRA only upon 100% completion of the implementation of the Resolution Plan – This binding nature of the RFRP was transferred onto the Resolution Plan through Clauses 7.3 and 9.4 respectively of the Resolution Plan – Even in light of the NCLAT’s own dated 26.05.2023, it does not follow that the PBG could have been adjusted by the SRA, mid-implementation, against its payment obligation. [Paras 104, 105, 107] 5.1 Once the Adjudicating Authority has approved the plan u/s.31(1) of the IBC, 2016, the Resolution Plan is binding on all the stakeholders including those stakeholders who are not direct participants of the CIRP – Therefore, there is absolutely no scope for modification of the terms of a Resolution Plan which has received the imprimatur of the Adjudicating Authority, be it by the Adjudicating Authority itself, the CoC or the SRA.
