This agreement was superseded by another agreement dated 01/12/2010 whereby the appellant became a licensee in respect of a warehouse on a monthly license fee of Rs.30 lakhs with an escalation clause. As there was default in payment of storage charges, the respondent gave a legal notice dated 27.11.2014 terminating the license, claiming dues towards storage charges, damages and directing the appellant to vacate the warehouse premises within two months. The appellant replied to the said notice on 18.12.2014 denying the dues and also raising some objections regarding extent of the building mentioned in the notice.
