17. In a recent pronouncement, relying on the Constitution Bench of this Court in In Re: Interplay between Arbitration Agreements under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 and the Indian 1 [2022] 13 SCR 660 : (2023) 2 SCC 539 2 [2023] 7 SCR 599 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 657 3 [2023] 15 SCR 909 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1683 538 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Stamp Act 1899,4 this Court in SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Krish Spinning reported in 2024 INSC 532, summarised the law on the scope and standard of judicial scrutiny that an application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 can be subjected to. The relevant parts are produced herein below: “114. In view of the observations made by this Court in In Re: Interplay (supra), it is clear that the scope of enquiry at the stage of appointment of arbitrator is limited to the scrutiny of prima facie existence of the arbitration agreement, and nothing else. For this reason, we find it difficult to hold that the observations made in Vidya Drolia (supra) and adopted in NTPC v. SPML (supra) that the jurisdiction of the referral court when dealing with the issue of “accord and satisfaction” under Section 11 extends to weeding out ex-facie non-arbitrable and frivolous disputes would continue to apply despite the subsequent decision in In Re: Interplay (supra). xxx xxx xxx 125. We are also of the view that ex-facie frivolity and dishonesty in litigation is an aspect which the arbitral tribunal is equally, if not more, capable to decide upon the appreciation of the evidence adduced by the parties. We say so because the arbitral tribunal has the benefit of going through all the relevant evidence and pleadings in much more detail than the referral court. If the referral court is able to see the frivolity in the litigation on the basis of bare minimum pleadings, then it would be incorrect to doubt that the arbitral tribunal would not be able to arrive at the same inference, most likely in the first few hearings itself, with the benefit of extensive pleadings and evidentiary material.” 18. The scope of inquiry under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 is limited to ascertaining the prima facie existence of an arbitration agreement. In the present case, the High Court exceeded this limited scope by undertaking a detailed examination of the factual matrix. The 4 [2023] 15 SCR 1081 : 2023 INSC 1066. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 539 Goqii Technologies Private Limited v. Sokrati Technologies Private Limited High Court erroneously proceeded to assess the auditor’s report in detail and dismissed the arbitration application. In our view, such an approach does not give effect to the legislative intent behind the 2015 amendment to the Act, 1996 which limited the judicial scrutiny at the stage of Section 11 solely to the prima facie determination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. 19. As observed in Krish Spinning (supra), frivolity in litigation too is an aspect which the referral court should not decide at the stage of Section 11 as the arbitrator is equally, if not more, competent to adjudicate the same.
