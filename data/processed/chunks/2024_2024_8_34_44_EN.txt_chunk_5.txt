[(1989) 1 SCC 164, 169 : 1989 SCC (Tax) 56] The use of the words “means and includes” in Rule 2(b) would, therefore, suggest that the definition of ‘college’ is intended to be exhaustive and not extensive and would cover 2 [1995] 2 SCR 1061 : 1995 Supp (2) SCC 348. 42 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports only the educational institutions falling in the categories specified in Rule 2(b) and other educational institutions are not comprehended. Insofar as engineering colleges are concerned, their exclusion may be for the reason that the opening and running of the private engineering colleges are controlled through the Board of Technical Education and Training and the Director of Technical Education in accordance with the directions issued by the AICTE from time to time.” 15. In the light of the above reproduced definition as provided for under Section 2(18) of the GVAT Act, it becomes obvious that the definition is enumerative and exhaustive. The use of the word “means” denote the intention of the legislature to restrict the scope of the “purchase price” to the categories enumerated in the definition itself. The purchase price, therefore, would be the amount of valuable consideration paid or payable for any purchase which would include amount of duties, levied or leviable under the two acts as has been provided for in this Section apart from the other charges as expounded therein. The scope has been limited to the two Acts mentioned in the Section itself. The same could not be expanded and therefore it can be safely said that the intention of the legislature was to exclude Value Added Tax from the ambit of purchase price as the same is not found mentioned in the categories of tax/duties enumerated thereunder. Sub-Section (32) of Section 2 of the GVAT Act defines turnover of purchases which reads as follows: - “2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, - [* * * * * *] 32. “turnover of purchases” means the aggregate of the amounts of purchase price paid or payable by a dealer in respect of any purchase of goods made by him during a given period after deducting the amount of purchase price, if any, refunded to the dealer by the seller in respect of any goods purchased from the seller and returned to him within the prescribed period.” 16. The above provision makes it amply clear that the purchase price would be the determinative factor for calculating the turnover of [2024] 8 S.C.R. 43 The State of Gujarat v. M/s Ambuja Cement Ltd. purchases, as stated above, the purchase price would be restrictive within the domain of Section 2(18). Section 11 of the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act deals with the tax credit. The relevant portion thereof reads as follows: 11. (1)(a) A registered dealer who has purchased the taxable goods (hereinafter referred to as the “purchasing dealer”) shall be entitled to claim tax credit equal to the amount of,- (i) tax collected from the purchasing dealer by a registered dealer from whom he has purchased such goods or the tax payable by the purchasing dealer to a registered dealer who has sold such goods to him during the tax period, or]; [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ] (b)The tax credit to be so claimed under this sub-section shall be subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2) to (12); and the tax credit shall be calculated in such manner as may be prescribed.
