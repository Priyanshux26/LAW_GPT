[Paras 19-26] Penal Code, 1860 – s. 300 exception 1 – Culpable homicide when not amounting to murder – Provocation when grave and sudden to bring the case under exception 1 to s. 300: Held: In to convert a case of murder to a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, provocation must be such that would temporarily deprive the power of self-control of a “reasonable person” – Provocation itself is not enough to reduce the crime from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder – Time gap between this alleged provocation and the act of homicide; the kind of weapon used; the number of blows, etc, is also to be seen – These are again all questions of facts – There is no standard or test as to what reasonableness should be in these circumstances as this would again be a question of fact to be determined by a Court. [Para 25] Criminal trial – Cross-examination of witness deferred by two months – Effect: Held: Such long adjournment after examination-in-chief, should never be given – This may affect the fairness of the trial and may even endanger, in a given case, the safety of the witness – As far as possible, the defence should be asked to cross examine the witness the same day or the following day – Only in very [2024] 7 S.C.R. 165 Surender Singh v. State (NCT of Delhi) exceptional cases, and for reasons to be recorded, the cross examination should be deferred and a short adjournment can be given after taking precautions and care, for the witness, if it is required – Courts should be slow in deferring these matters – This practice is not a healthy practice – Mandate of s. 231 Cr.PC and the law laid down on the subject to be followed in its letter and spirit – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 231.
