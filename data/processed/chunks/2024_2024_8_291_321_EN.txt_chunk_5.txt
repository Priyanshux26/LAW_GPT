It reasoned that such satisfaction required under Section 49 is complete only when the objections filed under Section 48 are finally decided, which was on 01.07.2014 in the present case (when the High Court dismissed the revision). It also observed that the appellants delayed execution of the award by initially filing under Section 34, despite such application not being maintainable and then filing an appeal against this and subsequently withdrawing it. The appellants cannot be permitted to benefit from the fluctuation in exchange rates when the delay is attributable to them. Therefore, the relevant date for conversion is 01.07.2014. 2.7 While issuing notice on the special leave petition filed by the appellant on 10.09.2018,9 this Court confined the issue to determining whether the foreign exchange rate as on 15.10.2010 would apply to the deposit of Rs. 8 crores. 3. Submissions: Learned senior counsel Mr. Pinaki Mishra appeared on behalf of the appellants. Initially, he submitted that 01.07.2014 would not be the relevant date for conversion for the entire amount and argued for using the exchange rate on 02.04.2011, when the Trial Court dismissed objections under Section 48. However, he later restricted his submissions to the exchange rate that applies when the amount of Rs. 8 crores was deposited by the appellants on 22.10.2010 as per the dated 15.10.2010. The crux of his argument is that the deposited amount stands converted as on the 6 2014 SCC OnLine Del 3348 7 SLP No. 27041/2014, dated 21.11.2014. 8 Section 49 of the Act reads: “49. Enforcement of foreign awards.—Where the Court is satisfied that the foreign award is enforceable under this Chapter, the award shall be deemed to be a decree of that Court.” 9 By 10.09.2018, this Court ed: “Issue notice, returnable within four weeks, limited to the conversion rate that would be applicable on 15.10.2010 insofar as the deposit of Rs. 7.5 Crores is concerned. The same will apply to the further deposit of Rs. 50,00,000/-.” [2024] 8 S.C.R. 299 DLF Ltd. (Formerly Known as DLF Universal Ltd) and Anr. v. Koncar Generators and Motors Ltd. date of its deposit, and this amount then cannot be converted again as per the exchange rate prevailing on 01.07.2014. He has submitted that the High Court passed an dated 15.10.2010 directing the appellants to deposit Rs. 7.5 crores on the consent of both parties, and also permitted the respondent to withdraw this amount on furnishing a bank guarantee in Indian rupee for the entire amount, to which the respondent had agreed at the time. He further submitted that the appellants cannot be faulted for the respondent not withdrawing the amount when it was deposited. In response to the respondent’s contention regarding their inability to furnish a bank guarantee of a scheduled Indian bank, he submitted that the respondent had agreed to this condition when the was passed, and in any case, it could have applied for a modification but did not do so. Since the respondent consented to the deposit of Rs. 7.5 crores and it was also permitted to withdraw the same, the amount stood converted as on the date of its deposit on 22.10.2010.
