[Para 65] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – Whether in the instant case, on a prima facie view, the SRG Group being a non- signatory to the Family Arrangement Agreement (FAA), can be referred to arbitration: Held: An important factor to be considered by the Courts and Tribunals is the participation of the non-signatory in the performance of the underlying contract – The intention of the parties to be bound by an arbitration agreement can be gauged from the circumstances that surround the participation of the non- signatory party in the negotiation, performance, and termination of the underlying contract containing such an agreement – Further, when the conduct of the non-signatory is in harmony with the conduct of the others, it might lead the other party or parties to legitimately believe that the non-signatory was a veritable party to the contract containing the arbitration agreement – However, in to infer consent of the non-signatory party, their involvement 896 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in the negotiation or performance of the contract must be positive, direct and substantial and not be merely incidental – Thus, the conduct of the non-signatory party along with the other attending circumstances may lead the referral court to draw a legitimate inference that it is a veritable party to the arbitration agreement – In the instant case, the clauses of FAA such as clause 2.1.4 read with Schedule 7, clause 2.1.6 read with Schedule 8, clause 2.1.7, gives an impression, though prima facie, that the SRG Group may be connected to the FAA and forms part of the settlement contemplated therein – However, this aspect needs to be looked into more closely by the Arbitral Tribunal – On bare perusal of the email exchanges produced by the petitioner, it appears prima facie that several contested questions of fact need to be first resolved – A detailed examination of numerous disputed questions of fact are imperative in deciding whether the SRG Group participated in the negotiation and performance of the underlying contract and can be bound by the arbitration agreement – There is a limited jurisdiction afforded under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 – This Court cannot conduct a mini trial and delve into contested or disputed questions of fact – Therefore, considering the complexity involved in the determination of the question whether the SRG Group is a veritable party to the arbitration agreement or not, it would be appropriate for the arbitral tribunal to take a call on the question after taking into consideration the evidence that may be adduced by the parties before it and the application of the legal doctrine as elaborated in the decision in Cox and Kings case.
