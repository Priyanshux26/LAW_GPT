On the other hand, in cases such as the one at hand, where the Rules were silent, it is open to the High Court to issue a Full Court Resolution. The High Court did so initially on 29 January 2013, but modified the Resolution on 30 November 2021 by prescribing that candidates for appointment to the Higher Judicial Service should have a minimum of 50% both in the written test as well as in the viva voce independently. The wisdom of the prescription is clear. A candidate should not just demonstrate the ability to reproduce their knowledge by answering questions in the suitability test, but must also demonstrate both practical knowledge and the application of the substantive law in the course of the interview. The Rules being silent, it was clearly open to the High Court to prescribe such a criterion as it did in 2013, when the 50% cutoff was prescribed on aggregate scores and also, in 2021, when the 50% cutoff was prescribed on the written test scores and the viva voce separately. 66. We are in agreement with the High Court that the State Government travelled beyond the remit of the consultation with the High Court by referring the matter to the Union Government. Any issue between the High Court and the State Government should have been ironed 30 State of West Bengal v. Nripendra Nath Bagchi, [1966] 1 SCR 771 : 1965 SCC OnLine SC 22; High Court of Punjab and Haryana v. State of Haryana, [1975] 3 SCR. 365 : (1975) 1 SCC 843, High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan v.

The State Government was bound to consult only the High Court in the manner elaborated by the abovementioned judgements. Any other exercise de hors such consultation would not be in accordance with the scheme of the Constitution. D. Conclusion 67. We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that the State Government was plainly in error in finding fault with the process which is being followed by the High Court and in concluding that the decision of the High Court amounted to an arbitrary exercise of power. Though the Solicitor General pointed out that the expressions “arbitrary” and “betrayal of trust” were used in the communication of the State Government placing reliance on an earlier of this Court, we would leave the matter at that while affirming the conclusion of the High Court. 68. For the above reasons, we hold that the impugned and of the High Court dated 20 December 2023 does not suffer from any legal or other infirmity. The appeals shall accordingly stand dismissed. 69. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Result of the case: Prastut Mahesh Dalvi, Hony. Associate Editor Appeals dismissed. (Verified by: Liz Mathew, Sr. Adv.)
