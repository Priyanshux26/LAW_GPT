The exceptions to the provisions contemplated under Article 370(1)(d), that is Article 1 and Article 370, were also noted in Puranlal Lakhanpal v Union of India.113 The route to modify Article 370 is through an under Article 370(3), which gives the power to the President to de-operationalize Article 370 or to make it operational subject to exceptions and modifi cations. 84. The same approach was followed even in the past to modify Article 370. For example, Article 370 of the Constitution of India, as originally enacted referred to “Maharaja” in the Explanation to Para (ii) of sub-clause (b) of Article 370. The reference to “Maharaja” was replaced by Sadar-i-Riyasat by C.O. 44. This was done under Article 370(3) on the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly which was in subsistence at the time. The other s referenced by the Respondents, such as C.O. 48 and C.O. 74 (which replaced Sadar-i-Riyasat with Governor), were merely clarifi catory and did not make any substantive amendments to Article 370. The direct eff ect of C.O. 272 is an amendment to Article 370(3) 85. Article 367(4) has been purportedly added under the President’s power to make modifi cations under Article 370(1)(d) when applying provisions of the Constitution of India. First, Article 367(4) is an interpretation clause whose purpose is to defi ne and give meaning to terms. If we allow Article 367(4) to be used to amend provisions of the Constitution, circumventing the procedure under Article 368 of the Constitution of India, or the procedure contemplated under other provisions, the eff ect would be disastrous. 86. Second, although the phrase “modifi cations” has not been defi ned in the Constitution, there are limits to every exercise of power. In this case, 113 (1955) 2 SCR 1101 IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 359 [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] the modifi cation is an addition that replaces one authority with another, but also changes the very core concept and nature of powers. The Constituent Assembly, is a constituent body and therefore, sovereign. A reference to a sovereign body cannot be construed as reference to Legislative Assembly. Dr. BR Ambedkar clearly underlined the importance of the constituent assembly being a non-partisan body as opposed to an elected legislative assembly where members would try to push a partisan agenda for the party. This has been captured in Jaganmohan Reddy J’s opinion in Kesavananda Bharati case.114 87. Thus, an exception or modifi cation cannot make a radical alteration that eff aces the fundamentals of the provision, as the substitution in C.O. 272 seeks to do. 88. Similarly, in Delhi Laws Act, In Re,115 the Court was examining the validity of Section 7 of the Delhi Laws Act, 1912, which provided as follows: “The Provincial Government may, by notifi cation in the Offi cial Gazette, extend with such restrictions and modifi cations as it thinks fi t to the Province of Delhi or any part thereof, any enactment which is in force in any part of British India at the date of such notifi cation.” (Emphasis supplied).
