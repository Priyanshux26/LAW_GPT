307 with the aid of s.34 of the IPC [Paras 32 and 33] Penal Code, 1860 – s. 34 – Common intention – Necessity: Held: To fasten liability with the aid of s.34 of the IPC what must necessarily be proved is a common intention to commit the crime actually committed and each accused person can be convicted of that crime, only if it is in furtherance of common intention of all – Common intention SUNIL v. STATE OF NCT OF DELHI 383 pre-supposes a prior concert, though pre-concert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary as common intention to bring about a particular result may develop on the spot – The question whether there was any common intention or not depends upon the inference to be drawn from the proven facts and circumstances of each case – The totality of the circumstances must be taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion whether the accused had a common intention to commit an off ence with which they could be convicted. [Para 29] Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 – Effect of not putting the incriminating circumstance of exhortation to the appellants while recording their statements u/s. 313 of the Cr.PC, 1973: Held: The legal position that emerges, inter-alia, is that to enable an accused to explain the circumstances appearing in the evidence against him, all the incriminating circumstances appearing against him in the evidence must be put to him – But where there has been a failure in putting those circumstances to the accused, the same would not ipso facto vitiate the trial unless it is shown that its non-compliance has prejudiced the accused – Where there is a delay in raising the plea, or the plea is raised for the fi rst time in this Court, it could be assumed that no prejudice had been felt by the accused – In the instant case, appellants were aware of the prosecution case against them as they were apprised of the FIR lodged by PW-2 which delineated their role as the ones who exhorted the main accused to fi re gunshots – Taking the above into account as also that the appellants were throughout represented by their counsel and had cross-examined the prosecution witnesses, yet they raised no such plea, either before the trial court or the High Court, it can safely be assumed that the appellants had suff ered no prejudice on that count.
