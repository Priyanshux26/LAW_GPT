185 of 1994 for the industrial establishments. The language of this GO is considered germane to the controversy and hence, the relevant portion thereof is extracted hereinbelow: - “With a view to overcome doubts in counting of seniority in respect of industrial employees who are working in trades listed at Annexure ‘A’ of SRO 185/1994 it has been decided to interpret rules relating to seniority in consonance with existing SRO provisions. Accordingly, the following rules for determining seniority may be followed in all OFs with immediate effect. 1) Semi-skilled posts are training post for skilled posts of trades listed at Annexure ‘A’ of SRO 185/1994. 2) Educational Qualification/Technical Qualification will not be deciding factor while counting seniority for trades listed at Annexure ‘A’ of SRO 185/1994. However, where passing of trade test/competency test or any other statutory certificate is required, the same must be adhered to and cannot be done away with. 3) Seniority will be counted from the date of promotion to Skilled grade and not from the date of induction/ entry/promotion in semi-skilled grade. 4)…… [2024] 10 S.C.R. 143 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others 5)…… 6) The above s are in consonance with the existing SRO provisions and various court s on the subject.” (emphasis supplied) 38. The validity of this GO31 was never assailed by the appellant at any stage either before the CAT or the High Court. A conjoint reading of SRO No. 185 of 1994 and the GO dated 24th December, 2002, which indisputably were applicable to the cadre of semi-skilled and skilled fitters in the respondent establishment32 at the relevant point of time would make it clear that the seniority in the skilled grade would have to be reckoned from the date of promotion to the skilled grade and not from the date of induction/entry in the semi-skilled grade and the candidate joining service in the semi-skilled grade would be mandatorily required to complete the probation period and also to clear the trade test for being promoted to the skilled grade. In the event of either of the two conditions not being met, the employee concerned would not be entitled to be promoted to the skilled grade. 39. The appellant, in support of his plea, has placed reliance on a GO dated 4th August, 2015, whereby the GO dated 24th December, 2002 has been superseded and it has been decided by the Competent Authority that “henceforth”, the seniority in respect of Industrial Establishments would be governed by the relevant clause of OM dated 4th November, 1992(reproduced supra). The said GO dated 4th August, 2015 is reproduced hereinbelow for the sake of ready reference: - “No. Per/I/Seniority/2015-16 Date: 04-08-2015 To The Sr. General Managers/ General Managers All Ordnance & Ordnance Equipment Factories Sub: Determination of Seniority in connection with direct Recruitment in the Industrial Establishment.
