Proceeding on the basis that the waqf dated 16.07.1934 was waqf-alal-aulad and which, in terms of Section C 2(2)(i), was not subject to the provisions of the 1936 Act, it was compulsorily registerable in view of Section 38(1). Any waqf which is registered under the 1936 Act would also be deemed to be registered under the 1960 Act. That is, though the 1936 Act did not apply to certain wakfs, but when it comes to registration under Section 38, it was mandatory for every wakf to be registered (i) D whether subject to the Act and ii) whether created before the Act or not. Thus, the registration of the Wakf dated 16.07.1934, was in fact compulsory under Section 38 of the 1936 Act. [Para 50][980- B-E] 1.13. It was found that there was a valid waqf from the E standpoint of the Shia law and the Consolidation Authorities also found that there was a waqf till the Deputy Director, Consolidation revisited the matter only on the basis of the compromise between the brothers, the terms of the waqf did contemplate a certain sum being set apart for charitable purposes. In this regard, the F stipulation in the deed that a sum of Rs. 500/- will be spent on charitable purpose such as Muazzin and lighting in the mosque and emambara, majlallse ashra of the sacred month of Moharram is noticed. No doubt, there is the residuary clause, which reveals that the wakif has provided that if descendants cease to exist, the income from the endowed property will be managed by a G Committee to be spent for charitable purposes. [Para 51][980-E- H; 981-A] 1.14. The extent of the income, which is set apart for the purpose, be it religious, pious or charitable, in the facts, cannot detract from the dedication of the whole property. [Para 53] H SABIR ALI KHAN v. SYED MOHD. AHMAD ALI KHAN AND 937 OTHERS 1.15. The fact that the property of the waqf has been dealt A with in a manner, which is illegal, or that it was not questioned, cannot deflect this Court from either finding that there was a valid waqf or that the property which remained of the waqf, must be dealt with in accordance with law. The compromise before the Deputy Director (Consolidation) and the based on the same B are in the teeth of Section 69 of the 1960 Act, therefore, the s passed by the Consolidated Officer and Settlement Officer about the Waqf would revive. [Para 54][982-G-H; 983-A] 1.16. The High Court proceeded on the basis that a Mutawalli may not be able to acquire title by adverse possession. C Equally, a trustee and a co-owner stand precluded in this regard. A beneficiary of a waqf, however, being neither a trustee nor a co-owner of waqf property, can acquire title through adverse possession even if it is the property of the waqf it is found. [Para 55][983-B-C] D 1.17. A beneficiary of a waqf cannot be described as a stranger to the waqf.
