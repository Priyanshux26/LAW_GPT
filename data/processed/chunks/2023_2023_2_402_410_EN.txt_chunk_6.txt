The time gap between the period when the deceased was last seen with the accused and the recovery of the corpse of the deceased being quite proximate, the non-explanation of the petitioner with regard to the circumstance under which and when the petitioner had departed the company of the deceased was a very crucial circumstance proved G against him. Having regard to the oral evidence of the witnesses, the enmity between the deceased and the petitioner had also surfaced. The corroborative evidence with regard to recovery of the weapon – axe alleged to have been used in the commission of crime from the petitioner, also substantiated the case of prosecution. H 410 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A 11. The entire oral as well as documentary evidence having been threadbare considered by the Sessions Court as also High Court while holding the petitioner guilty of the charged offence, this Court need not again reappreciate the same in the petition under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. Suffice it to say that the learned Senior Advocate Mr. Khurshid has failed to point out during the course of his arguments B any perversity or illegality in the impugned s passed by the courts below, which would shake the conscience of this Court warranting interference in the impugned s. 12. In that view of the matter, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned s and s passed by the courts below. The C Special Leave Petition stands dismissed accordingly. Ankit Gyan Appeal dismissed. (Assisted by : Bhavyata Kapoor, LCRA) D E F G H
