Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: Such cases can be considered only by the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code or in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution – Powers under Section 438 of the CrPC cannot be exercised once the contents of the complaint/FIR disclose a prima facie case. [Para 49] Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 – s.18 – “arrest of any person” – Significance – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.41, 60A: Held: s.18 bars anticipatory bail only in cases where a valid arrest of the accused person can be made as per Section 41 read with Section 60A of CrPC – An arrest cannot be made merely because it is lawful to do so – An arrest can be effected if there is a reasonable complaint, credible information or reasonable suspicion and the police officer has a reason to believe that such offence has been committed by the accused person and the arrest is necessary – The term ‘arrest’ appearing in the text of Section 18 is to be construed and understood in the larger context of the powers of police to effect an arrest and the restrictions imposed by the statute and the courts on the exercise of such power – Thus, the bar under Section 18 would apply only to those cases where prima facie materials exist pointing towards the commission of an offence under the 1989 Act because it is only when a prima facie case is made out that the pre-arrest requirements as stipulated under Section 41 of CrPC could be said to be satisfied. [Paras 41, 43, 44, 46] Interpretation of Statutes – Penal Statutes – Strict interpretation – Principles of statutory interpretation: Held: A penal statute must receive strict construction – A principle of statutory interpretation embodies the policy of the law which is based on public policy – The court presumes, unless the contrary intention appears, that the legislator intended to conform to this legal policy – A principle of statutory interpretation is a principle of legal policy formulated as a guide to the legislative intention.
