Sukumar Pyne9; 5 (1953) SCR 1188 6 (1963) 2 SCR 111 7 (1964) 4 SCR 630 8 (1964) 7 SCR 676 9 (1966) 2 SCR 34 14 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. (6) G.P. Nayyar Vs. State (Delhi Administration)10; (7) Soni Devrajbhai Babubhai Vs. State of Gujarat and Others11; (8) Securities and Exchange Board of India Vs. Ajay Agarwal12; 10.4. Referring to Section 6A of the DSPE Act, it was submitted that the same is not a penal provision and it does not create a new off ence nor does it increase the punishment for an existing off ence, which existed on the date of the commission of off ence. 10.5. Prior to insertion of Section 6A in the DSPE Act, similar provision was existing in Single Directive No.4.7(3) requiring prior sanction to investigation. This Court in the case of Vineet Narain and Others Vs. Union of India and Another13, amongst other larger issues was also testing the validity of the Single Directive No.4.7(3). This Court held in the said case that by administrative instructions the statutory powers could not be intermeddled or impeded. It accordingly declared Single Directive No.4.7(3)(i) as invalid. 10.6. As a result of such declaration Section 6A was introduced in the DSPE Act in the year 2003 vide Section 26(c) of the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 w.e.f. 11.09.2003. 10.7. Section 6A of the DSPE Act, undeniably does not create a new off ence nor does it obliterate the off ence. The Constitution Bench in Subramanian Swamy’s case (supra) noted that the classifi cation made in Section 6A neither eliminates public mischief nor achieves some positive public good and, therefore, the classifi cation was held to be discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution as it side-tracks the fundamental objects of the PC Act, 1988 to deal with corruption. 10.8. Shri Mehta commenting upon Section 6A of the DSPE Act enlisted the following short conclusions: (a) It is not a provision creating an off ence or providing immunity from an off ence under which anyone can be punished; 10 (1979) 2 SCC 593 11 (1991) 4 SCC 298 12 (2010) 3 SCC 765 13 (1998) 1 SCC 226 CBI v. R.R. KISHORE 15 [VIKRAM NATH, J.] (b) The said provision did not exempt applicability of anti-corruption laws to offi cers above the rank of Joint Secretary; (c) It was a mere executive safety mechanism; It was a mere initial protective net of a particular kind which this Hon’ble Court declared as unconstitutional; (d) The said provision did not seek to create individual rights or immunities rather was, as was the submission of the Union of India in Subramanian Swamy (supra), a provision which was aimed at protecting bona fi de actions for ensuring honest decisions/advice in governmental functioning. (e) It was not aimed as an immunity or substantive exclusion from application of laws, rather was a preliminary check provided in to ensure honest offi cials are not unnecessarily harassed.
