302, 364A, 120B, 201. [Paras 22, 27 and 39] Criminal Law – Investigation – Panchnamas and memos: Held: In the present case, the manner and method in which the panchnamas and memos were prepared leave the prosecution high and dry – The witnesses to the panchnamas and the seizures acted as mere attestors to the documents and did not disclose in their own words as to how these objects were discovered, i.e., at whose instance and how – No lawful validity attaches to these proceedings recorded by the police in the context of collection of all this evidence – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. [Para 31, 32] RAJESH & ANR. v. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH 3 Evidence – DNA evidence- hair, source and origin suspected – Non-reliance upon: Held: In the present case, DNA evidence was also relied upon by the prosecution, by projecting a scenario that the deceased had struggled with his assailant and in the course of that scuffl e, he managed to pull out some hair from the head of his assailant and they remained in his hand till the discovery of his body – DNA analysis of that hair proved that they were those of one of the appellant, ‘RY’ – However, on facts, this story is found to be bereft of logic – Further, as there is a doubt as to when ‘RY’ was taken by the police and as to whether his hair could have been pulled out by the police while he was in their control, the possibility of such evidence being introduced by the police themselves cannot be ruled out – Thus, as the source and origin of the DNA evidence, viz., the hair, is rendered suspect, the end result of that DNA analysis serves no real purpose in establishing the prosecution’s case.
