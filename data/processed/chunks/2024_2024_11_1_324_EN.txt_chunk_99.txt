Similarly, in cases such as Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India127 and Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corpn.,128 this Court expanded the interpretation of Article 21 in light of various Directive Principles and held that these principles are fundamental to“understanding the meaning and content of fundamental rights”. 147. In sum,the Directive Principles play an integral role in constitutional interpretation by this Court. Firstly, fundamental rights are to be interpreted harmoniously and in light of these Directive Principles. Secondly, they act as markers of reasonable restrictions on fundamental rights. Therefore, given the role of Directive Principles in constitutional adjudication by this Court, it cannot abdicate the task of interpreting Article 39(b). iv. Historical Context: Constituent Assembly Debates 148. Most counsel before us have sought to rely on the debates before the constituent assembly to buttress their understanding of Article 39(b). Both sides have drawn different inferences from the discussions of the 125 [1976] 1 SCR 906 : (1976) 2 SCC 310 : 1975 INSC 224 126 [2008] 4 SCR 1 : (2008) 6 SCC 1 : 2008 INSC 473 127 [1984] 2 SCR 67 : (1984) 3 SCC 161 [10] : 1983 INSC 203 128 [1985] Supp. 2 SCR 51 : (1985) 3 SCC 545 [33] : 1985 INSC 151 136 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports members of the Constituent Assembly. To address these arguments and understand the intention behind the introduction of Article 39(b) in the Constitution, we will review the debates and discussions in the assembly that are relevant to the issue at hand. a. Debates about the purpose of Directive Principles 149. On 4 November 1948, Dr BR Ambedkar moved a motion to introduce the draft constitution and delivered a landmark speech, explaining the intentions and ideas behind various provisions of the draft constitution. Dr Ambedkar elucidated the purpose behind including Directive Principles in the Constitution. He stated that they are a novel feature of our Constitution and the only other Constitution which embodies such principles is that of Ireland. He dismissed the criticism that such principles are merely ‘pious declarations’ which do not have any binding force. Dr Ambedkar observed: “If it is said that the Directive Principles have no legal force behind them, I am prepared to admit it. But I am not prepared to admit that they have no sort of binding force at all. Nor am I prepared to concede that they are useless because they have no binding force in law.” 150. According to Dr BR Ambedkar, the Directive Principles are akin to the ‘Instrument of Instructions’ issued to the Governor-General and the Governors of the colonies by the British Government under the Government of India Act 1935. The only difference was that the Directive Principles are in the form of instructions to the Legislature and the Executive. He stated that while future governments may not be answerable for a breach of such principles in a court of law, they would respect these principles, knowing that they are answerable for them before the electorate.
