A2, A3 and A5 – Exhibit- 96 being hit by s.25, Evidence Act cannot be read in evidence for any purpose whatsoever – The prosecution pinned the identity of A2, A3, and A5 as the assailants on the basis of the disclosure statement (Exhibit -96) of A1 – They were primarily convicted on the basis of the recoveries of knives and clothes – These so called incriminating articles allegedly recovered at the instance of the accused were never sent to the Serology expert for comparison of the blood groups existing thereupon with the blood group of the deceased – Evidence of the concerned police officials associated with the recoveries and their testimonies were highly doubtful – The knife which was recovered at the instance of A3 was found from a nala which is a place open and accessible to all – The knife attributed to A4 cannot be linked to him – Recoveries were highly doubtful and tainted – These 1180 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports recoveries in no manner can be treated to be incriminating in nature – Even if it is assumed that such recoveries were effected, the same did not lead to any conclusive circumstance in form of Serological report establishing the presence of the same blood group as that of the deceased and hence they do not further the cause of prosecution – Prosecution failed to lead the link evidence mandatorily required to establish the factum of safe keeping of the muddamal articles and hence, the recoveries became irrelevant. [Paras 26-28, 30, 34-36] Evidence – Confession of one co-a ccused against the other – Evidentiary value – Such statement not a substantive piece of evidence.
