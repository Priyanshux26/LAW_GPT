We take note of several s of this Court that have dismissed appeals arising out of similar s and similar facts.17 We find it necessary to state our reasons for dismissing the present appeals, to finally settle this issue. We will therefore analyse the submissions of the learned counsels in light of the scope of our jurisdiction and the reasoning and findings of the impugned . 8.1 At the outset, it is necessary to state that the learned ASG and learned senior counsel for the appellant have not proposed a substantial question of law for this Court to consider. Rather, they have argued on facts as to whether or not the delay is attributable to the respondents, and consequently whether force majeure is applicable. We will analyse the impugned , as well as the KERC’s , to determine whether there is any substantial question of law that calls for our interference. 9. Clauses of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA): Before discussing the s of the KERC and the APTEL, it is necessary to identify the relevant clauses of the PPA. Article 2.1 of the PPA imposes the obligation on the SPD to secure necessary approvals, clearances, and permits within 365 days. Liquidated damages can be imposed on the SPD under Article 2.2 in case of delay, provided that the delay is not attributable to the appellant or due to a force majeure event. 16 The requirement of ‘substantial question of law’ for this Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction under Section 125 has also been recognised in BSES Rajdhani Power Limited v. Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (2023) 4 SCC 788. 17 In Civil Appeal No. 3958/2020; Civil Appeal No. 897/2022; Civil Appeal No. 5134/2021; Civil Appeal Diary Nos. 32980/2022, 33053/2022 and 33572/2022. 1038 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 9.1 Article 2.5.1 permits the extension of the SCD in case the SPD is unable to fulfil its contractual obligations due to the appellant’s default or there are force majeure events that affect either the appellant or the SPD. The list of force majeure events is set out in Article 8.3(a), and sub-clause (vi) is the most relevant for us. A party can invoke the force majeure clause subject to the conditions set out in Article 8.3(b). 9.2 Article 2.5.7 provides that subject to the other provisions of the PPA, the SPD is liable to pay liquidated damages if it is unable to supply power to the appellant by the SCD. Therefore, the payment of damages under this clause is subject to an extension of time under Article 2.5.1. Article 5.1 provides for the tariff rate payable to the SPD as Rs. 8.40 per unit. However, in cases of delay, subject to extension of time under Article 2.5, it provides that the lower of Rs. 8.40 per unit and the varied tariff applicable as on the date of commercial operation will apply. A plain reading of Article 5.1 makes it clear that the lower tariff will not apply if there is an extension of time under Article 2.5.
