from survey nos. 8 and 5/1. Total area of the plot was 1500 sq.ft. It was sold @ Rs.l00/- per sq.ft. It has come on record that this plot was sold by one Usha Santoshrao Gole to Ashok Krushnarao Sapkal and Shalikram Ramkrushna Zamre. It is to be noted that this sale transaction has been made the basis for quantifying the enhanced compensation by the learned Presiding Officer of the Reference Court. The vendor and vendee are not concerned with the claimants in any manner. In our opinion, therefore, the contention of the respondents that this sale instance was brought into existence to claim excessive and exorbitant compensation by the claimants cannot be accepted. On a perusal of the oral evidence adduced by the claimants and supporting documentary evidence, we do not see any reason to discard and disbelieve this sale instance.” 107. Hence, the High Court ultimately confirmed the of the Reference Court relying upon Exh. 75 sale deed dated 12.02.1999 for Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. It expressly recorded that the vendor and vendee were not concerned with the claimants in any manner and that was also the admitted case of the State. Rejecting Exh. 76, Exh. 77 and Exh. 78, the High Court recorded that the sale deeds were executed by members of the family and as such it did not chose to rely upon the same. Findings: 108. We have already in this while dealing with Civil Appeal Nos. 6776-6777 of 2013 hereinabove, discussed the correctness of the and in LAC No. 209 of 2002, which reference concerned the present appellants. We have also discussed the law on reliance of exemplars of unrelated parties and related parties and as to how when there are two exemplars, one between unrelated parties at arm’s length and the other between related parties mentioning a [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2293 Kazi Akiloddin v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. higher value and when both are within reasonable time gap, prudence would dictate and common sense would command the acceptability of the exemplars involving unrelated parties. The same reasoning applies here also. 109. We have also therein discussed the law on the applicability of the development charges and also dealt therein the aspect of in what circumstances the value fetched by smaller plots can be applied in valuing larger tracts of land. Additionally, it has also to be borne in mind that while Rs.100/- per sq. ft. was awarded by the Reference Court for plotted area admeasuring 359684.44 sq. ft., for the open belt area admeasuring 108501.12 sq. ft., the enhanced compensation was only @ Rs. 50/- per sq. ft. Additionally, for the plot area created due to division admeasuring 28809.84 per sq. ft., the enhanced compensation was @ Rs. 25/- per sq. ft. For this reason also, additionally, we are not inclined to make any deduction in the amount of Rs.100/- per sq. ft. awarded for the plot area admeasuring 359684.44 sq. ft. In view of the above, both the Civil Appeals are dismissed.
