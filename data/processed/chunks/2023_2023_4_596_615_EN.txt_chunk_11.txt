In this respect, we may first refer to the of this Court in the case of Swiss Ribbons (supra). Section 12A of IBC permitted withdrawal of applications admitted under sections 7, 9 or 10 of IBC.But the said provision envisaged a situation where the withdrawal application would be filed after the CoC has been constituted, as it requires approval of 90 F per cent voting shares of CoC. There was no provision which would deal with withdrawal of proceedings before constitution of CoC. Even Regulation 30A, as it existed earlier, did not contemplate of consideration of an application for withdrawal filed before constitution of CoC. This issue was flagged by this Court in the case of Swiss Ribbons (supra) G in paragraph 82 thereof which is reproduced hereunder: “82. It is clear that once the Code gets triggered by admission of a creditor’s petition under Sections 7 to 9, the proceeding that is before the adjudicating authority, being a collective proceeding, is a proceeding in rem. Being a proceeding in rem, it is necessary H 612 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A that the body which is to oversee the resolution process must be consulted before any individual corporate debtor is allowed to settle its claim. A question arises as to what is to happen before a Committee of Creditors is constituted (as per the timelines that are specified, a Committee of Creditors can be appointed at any time within 30 days from the date of appointment of the interim B resolution professional). We make it clear that at any stage where the Committee of Creditors is not yet constituted, a party can approach NCLT directly, which Tribunal may, in exercise of its inherent powers under Rule 11 of NCLT Rules, 2016, allow or disallow an application for withdrawal or settlement. This will be C decided after hearing all the parties concerned and considering all relevant factors on the facts of each case.” This Court had required the NCLT to invoke its powers under Rule 11 of the NCLT Rules. 34. It was after the observations made by this Court in the case D of Swiss Ribbons (supra), as noted above and also considering the aspect that large number of s were being passed by this Court invoking Article 142 of the Constitution that IBBI Regulations which were framed by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India21 exercising powers conferred under sections 5, 7, 9, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 24, E 25, 29, 30, 196, 208 read with section 240 substituted section 30A vide notification dated 25.07.2019. The Board was conferred with powers to frame regulations for various purposes referred to insection 240 of IBC and the other allied sections. These regulations maybe subordinate in character but would still carry a statutory flavor and would be binding on the NCLT. The NCLT committed an error in holding that Regulation F 30A would have no binding effect. This would amount to defeating the very purpose of substituting Regulation 30A in IBBI Regulations on 25.07.2019 after the of Swiss Ribbons(supra) which was dated 25.01.2019.
