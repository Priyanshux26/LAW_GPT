In Chinnaiah (supra), this Court held that the Scheduled Castes cannot be further classified for the purpose of reservation because they constitute an internally homogenous class by virtue of their 104 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Hegde J,32] 105 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Hegde,37,43] 106 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Hegde,36] 107 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sema, 46-50] 108 Chinnaiah (supra) [Justice Sinha, 81] 109 ibid. 1378 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports inclusion in the Presidential list and thus, as a class, groups within the Scheduled Castes cannot be treated differently. In view of the already existing classification of the Scheduled Castes under the Constitution, further classification and consequent preferential treatment were held to violate Article 14, as it would amount to a constitutionally proscribed ‘micro-classification’. To appreciate the correctness of this view of Article 14 and micro-classification, we must analyze the contours of the equality guarantee and permissibility of sub-classification under Article 14. a. The contours of Article 14 78. Article 14 employs two expressions – equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. Both different in content and sweep.110 “Equality before the law”-, an expression derived from the English Common law, entails absence of special privileges for any individual within the territory. It does not mean that the same law should apply to everyone, but that the same law should apply to those who are similarly situated.111 The expression “equal protection of the laws” means that among equals, laws must be equally administered. It enjoins the State with the power to reasonably classify those who are differently placed. The mandate of “equal protection of laws” casts a positive obligation on the state to ensure that everyone may enjoy equal protection of the laws, and no one is unfairly denied this protection. In essence, the guarantee of equality entails that all persons in like circumstances must be treated alike. That there must be a parity of treatment under parity of conditions.112 Equality does not entail sameness. The State is allowed to classify in a manner that is not discriminatory. The doctrine of classification gives content to the guarantee of equal protection of the laws.113 Under this approach, the focus is on the equality of results or opportunities over equality of treatment.114 110 Indra Sawhney (supra) [Justice Reddy,643] 111 Gauri Shankar v.

[2024] 8 S.C.R. 1379 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. 79. The Constitution permits valid classification if two conditions are fulfilled. First, there must be an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons grouped together from others left out of the group. The phrase “intelligible differentia” means difference capable of being understood.115 The difference is capable of being understood when there is a yardstick to differentiate the class included and others excluded from the group.116 In the absence of the yardstick, the differentiation would be without a basis and hence, unreasonable.
