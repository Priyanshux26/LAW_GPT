there was inordinate and unexplained delay on the part of the police authority in submission of the same. ANALYSIS 11. Let us consider the first contention. According to the appellant, he is an Indian citizen. Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946 mandates that the onus of proving citizenship of a person is upon that person who claims to be a citizen of India. For better appreciation, Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946, is extracted below: “9. Burden of proof.—If in any case not falling under section 8 any question arises with reference to this Act or any made or direction given thereunder, whether any person is or is not a foreigner of a particular class or description the onus of proving that such person is not a foreigner or is not a foreigner of such particular class or description, as the case may be, shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), lie upon such person.” 11.1. In Sarbananda Sonowal v. Union of India,7 this Court pointed out that ‘there is good and sound reason for placing the burden of proof upon the person concerned who asserts to be a citizen of a particular country. In to establish one’s citizenship, normally he may be required to give evidence of his date of birth, place of birth, name of his parents, their place of birth and citizenship. Sometimes the place of birth of his grandparents may also be relevant. All these facts would necessarily be within the personal knowledge of the person concerned and not of the authorities of the State’. 11.2. In Lal Babu Hussein v. Electoral Registration Officer,8 it was held by this Court that ‘the question whether a person is a foreigner, is a question of fact which would require careful scrutiny of evidence since the enquiry is quasi-judicial in character’. 11.3. In the instant case, the appellant claimed that his grandparents are Indian citizens because of their birth. The provisions relating 7 [2006] Supp. 10 SCR 167 : (2007) 1 SCC 174 8 [1995] 1 SCR 877 : (1995) 3 SCC 100 428 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports to citizenship are enshrined in Part II of the Constitution of India under Articles 5 to 11. Section 4 of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, entitles the appellant’s father to be treated as a citizen by descent. The appellant is also entitled to citizenship by registration as per Section 5 of the Act. As per Section 5(1)(a), a person of Indian origin who has been an ordinary resident in India for seven years prior to the application and as per 5(1)(b), a person of Indian origin who is an ordinary resident of any country or place outside undivided India is entitled to citizenship. “Undivided India” has been defined in Section 2 (h) as “India, as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935” as originally enacted. The intention of the Central Government to award citizenship to minorities from neighboring countries has been spelled out by way of amendment to Section 2, by introducing Proviso in Section 2 vide Amendment Act No.47 of 2019 with effect from 10.01.2020, which states that the persons like the appellant herein are not be treated as “illegal migrants”.
