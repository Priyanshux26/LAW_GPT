Also there were regular disputes between the usage of the property [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1287 Bina Basak & Ors. v. Sri Bipul Kanti Basak & Ors. and common amenities and as such it became necessary to file a suit for their eviction. 3.11. The defendants to the suit filed written statement along with counterclaim praying for a decree that the lease deed dated 03.11.1975 be declared as invalid and inoperative in law and for appropriate injunction against the plaintiff. The written statement and the counterclaim were based on the fact that the three brothers constituted the joint family; the policy of the Government was to provide rehabilitation to the entire family and not to the individual; the request of the defendants to include their names in the lease deed had been positively considered by the Government; the house was constructed from the joint fund from the income of all the three brothers. 3.12. During the pendency of the suit, the Government had come up with policy of freehold and had accordingly issued freehold title deeds separately with respect to the family of the three brothers. It had further canceled the lease deed dated 03.11.1975 and the same was duly communicated to Smt. Hem Prova Basak vide communication dated 25.05.1995. In the said letter, it was clearly stated that as the freehold title deeds are going to be issued to the eligible beneficiaries, the lease deed No.7658 of 03.11.1975 has been cancelled and as such she was required to submit the original lease deed. 3.13. Smt. Hem Prova Basak instituted an Original Civil Suit No.68 of 1995 impleading the State of West Bengal and its officers as defendants challenging the cancellation of the lease deed No.7685. The relief claimed in the said suit was that a declaration be made that the notice dated 25.05.1995 issued by the office of Sub-Divisional Officer, Siliguri, as illegal, invalid and without jurisdiction with the further relief of permanent injunction against the defendants restraining them to act upon the said notice. 3.14. After a detailed inquiry, it was held that fresh freehold title deeds be issued as per calculation in paragraph ‘C’ of the said report in favour of the family members of all the brothers. The defendants to the suit of 1983 filed an amendment application under VI Rule 17, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, seeking amendment in the written statement in to incorporate the 1288 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports subsequent development regarding the cancellation of lease deed as also to issue freehold title deeds. Additionally, the plaintiff also sought amendment in the relief clause to the extent that the declaration be made that the freehold title deeds in favour of the defendants is not valid. They were void and not binding on the plaintiff. Both the amendments were allowed. 4. The Trial Court, after considering the material on record, dismissed the Original Civil Suit No.16 of 1983 and partially allowed the counterclaim declaring that the lease deed dated 03.11.1975 in favour of the plaintiff was illegal, inoperative, and invalid.
