1232 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (ix) We do not for a moment say that, the Closest Connection Test has no application whatsoever, where there is no express or implied designation of a place of arbitration in the agreement either in the form of ‘venue’ or ‘curial law’, there the closest connection test may be more suitable for determining the seat of arbitration. (x) Where two or more possible places that have been designated in the arbitration agreement either expressly or impliedly, equally appear to be the seat of arbitration, then in such cases the conflict may be resolved through recourse to the Doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens, and the seat be then determined based on which one of the possible places may be the most appropriate forum keeping in mind the nature of the agreement, the dispute at hand, the parties themselves and their intentions. The place most suited for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice may be determined as the ‘seat’ of arbitration. 72. Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, we have reached the conclusion that the present petition under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 is not maintainable as neither the seat of arbitration is India nor is the arbitration agreement governed by laws of India. 73. In the result, the present petition filed by the petitioner fails and is hereby dismissed. 74. The parties shall bear their own costs. 75. Pending application(s), if any, also stand disposed of. Result of the case: Petition dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
