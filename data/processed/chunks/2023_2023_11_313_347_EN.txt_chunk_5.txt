It is also pertinent to note that in the FIR, no date and time of the alleged incident has been stated. No plausible explanation was off ered by the fi rst informant as to why there was inordinate delay in lodging the FIR. 6. The appellants herein went before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad and fi led Criminal Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 15174 of 2022 and prayed for the quashing of the FIR in question. The High Court declined to entertain the writ application and rejected the same observing as under:- “Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned A.G.A for the State respondents. The relief sought in this petition is for quashing of the F.I.R. dated 19.09.2022, registered as Case Crime No. 0224 of 2022, under sections 395, 504, 506, 323 I.P.C., Police Station Mirzapur, District Saharanpur. Learned AGA opposed the prayer for quashing of the FIR, which discloses cognizable off ence. Perusal of the impugned fi rst information report prima facie reveals commission of cognizable off ence. Therefore, in view of the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Haryana and others vs. Bhajan Lal and others, 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335 and M/s Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 2021 SC 1918 and in Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No.3262/2021 (Leelavati Devi @ Leelawati & another vs. the State of Uttar Pradesh) decided on 07.10.2021, no case has been made out for interference with the impugned fi rst information report. Therefore, the writ petition is dismissed leaving it open for the petitioners to apply before the competent court for anticipatory bail/ bail as permissible under law and in accordance with law.” MOHAMMAD WAJID AND ANR. v. STATE OF U.P. 321 AND ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfi ed with the aforesaid, the appellants are before this Court with the present appeal.
