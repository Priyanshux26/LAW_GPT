Digital Supreme Court Reports 12 prohibits an employer from reducing, whether directly or indirectly, the wages of an employee to whom the Scheme applies or the total quantum of benefits in the nature of old age pension, gratuity, provident fund or life insurance to which the employee is entitled under the terms of his employment express or implied. The said section proceeds on the basis that if an employee is entitled to any benefit in the nature of old age pension under the terms of his employment the said benefit would not be denied to him on the application of the Scheme. It is not the case of the petitioners that on June 30, 1961, when the Provident Fund Scheme was made applicable to the Commission, the petitioners had become permanent and were entitled to pension. It cannot, therefore, be said that on the date of the application of the Provident Fund Scheme to the Commission, the petitioners were entitled to pension under the terms of their employment. They cannot, therefore, invoke the provisions of Section 12 of the Provident Fund Act.” 33. In the matter of Prabhu Narain vs. State of U.P.,19 (2004) 13 SCC 662, this Court held that to receive pension the employees must establish that they are entitled to pension under a particular rule or scheme. The following has been held in para 5: “5. No doubt pension is not a bounty, it is a valuable right given to an employee, but, in the first place it must be shown that the employee is entitled to pension under a particular rule or the scheme, as the case may be.” 34. In yet another rendered in Rajasthan Road Transport Corporation & Anr. Vs. Mohini Devi,20 it is held thus in para nos. 7, 8 & 9: “7. The Division Bench has considered the Regulations but failed to notice that there is apparent error in the passed by the learned Single Judge. Indisputably, the employees concerned retired from service in 1991 and 1992 19 (2004) 13 SCC 662 20 [2013] 3 SCR 464 : (2013) 11 SCC 603 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1391 U.P. Roadways Retired Officials and Officers Association v. State of U.P. & Anr. and after retirement they were paid CPF including the share of employer’s contribution. Hence, as per Regulation 3 of the Regulations, no right accrued to the appellants/employees to claim pensionary benefits without first depositing the amount and complying with the Regulations. 8. The matter was examined by this Court in Pepsu RTC v. Mangal Singh [(2011) 11 SCC 702 : (2011) 2 SCC (L&S) 322] wherein it was held as under: (SCC p. 722, paras 51-52) “51. The common thread which runs through all these appeals canvassed before us is that the respondents have failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Regulations, which govern the Pension Scheme. We have already considered the nature and effect of the Regulations, which are made under a statute. These statutory regulations require to be interpreted in the same manner which is adopted while interpreting any other statutory provisions.
