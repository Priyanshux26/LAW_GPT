Then, the prayers made in the freshly instituted civil suits, being CS Nos. 118 of 2022 and 119 of 2022, for preventing the meeting dated 11.07.2022 were declined by a learned Single Judge of the High Court on 11.07.2022, in the passed just before the scheduled time of the meeting. The said meeting dated 11.07.2022 was, F accordingly, held at the scheduled time and various resolutions were adopted therein but, the said dated 11.07.2022 as passed by the learned Single Judge was found to have been passed on wrong notion about the purport of the of this Court dated 06.07.2022 and hence, by an dated 27.09.2022, this Court remanded the matter for G reconsideration. Thereafter, the interim relief applications in the said newly filed civil suits were decided by a learned Single Judge of the High Court on 17.08.2022 granting certain interim reliefs and providing, inter alia, that status quo ante as existing on 23.06.2022 shall be maintained and there would be no Executive Council or General Council meeting without joint consent of the Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator. H THIRU K. PALANISWAMY v. M. SHANMUGAM & ORS. 1189 [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] The said dated 17.08.2022 was, however, set aside by the Division A Bench of the High Court by its impugned dated 02.09.2022. The question is as to whether the so passed by the Division Bench of the High Court calls for interference by this Court. 25. It is apparent from a close look at the dated 17.08.2022 B that grant of temporary injunction in these matters by the learned Single Judge was premised essentially on three factors: first and the foremost being that as per the byelaws of the party, the General Council meeting could have been convened only by the Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator and they having not done so, the meeting dated 11.07.2022 was wholly unauthorised. Additionally, the said meeting dated 11.07.2022 was not C convened by providing 15 days’ advance notice, as required by Rule 19(vii) of the byelaws. Secondly, the learned Single Judge was of the view that by not granting injunction, EPS, who convened the General Council meeting contrary to the provisions of the byelaws, would be in a more convenient position for having allegedly removed the plaintiff OPS D and few others from the party membership and they could not have even participated in the proposed General Secretary elections. According to the learned Single Judge, balance of convenience and irreparable injury in the given context were required to be visualised with reference to the viewpoints of the primary membersof the party. Thirdly, the learned Single E Judge was of the view that when OPS and EPS had successfully functioned jointly as Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator, how the party, with more than 1.5 crore cadre strength, suddenly decided to change the existing dispensation. The ultimate injunction issued by the learned Single Judge had been that of restoring status quoante as on 23.06.2022 and F further to that, it was ordained that the Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator have to function jointly, meetings have to be called with their joint consent and on being properly requisitioned, they would not refuse to convene the General Council meeting, and that they could approach the Court for necessary directions for conducting the General Council meeting.
