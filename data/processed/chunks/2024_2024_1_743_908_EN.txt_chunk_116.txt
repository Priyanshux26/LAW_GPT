They had lost their right to liberty once they were convicted and were imprisoned. But, they were released pursuant to the impugned remission s which have been quashed by us. Consequently, the status quo ante must be restored. We say so for another reason in the event respondent Nos.3 to 13 are inclined to seek remission in accordance with law,they have to be in prison as they cannot seek remission when on bail or outside the jail. Therefore, for these reasons we hold that the plea of ‘protection of the liberty’ of respondent Nos.3 to 13 cannot be accepted by us. 70. We wish to emphasize that in the instant case rule of law must prevail. If ultimately rule of law is to prevail and the impugned s of remission are set-aside by us, then the natural consequences must follow. Therefore, respondent Nos.3 to 13 are directed to report to the concerned jail authorities within two weeks from today. 908 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Conclusion: 71.
