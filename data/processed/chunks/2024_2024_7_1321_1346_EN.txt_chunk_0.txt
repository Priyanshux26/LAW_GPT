Viswanathan, JJ.] Issue for Consideration If there was any discrepancy in the pay scales of Sub-Deputy Inspectors of Schools/Assistant Basic Shiksha Adhikaris (SDI/ ABSA) and Deputy Basic Shiksha Adhikaris (DBSA) of the Basic Education Department, State of Uttar Pradesh vis-à-vis the Headmasters of Junior High Schools, as alleged. Whether the SDI/ ABSA and DBSA were entitled to the higher pay scale of 7500- 12000 with effect from 01.07.2001 or whether it was appropriately granted to them from 01.12.2008 onwards. Headnotes† Service Law – Uttar Pradesh Subordinate Educational (Sub Deputy Inspector of Schools) Service Rules, 1992 – Pay parity – Revision in pay scales – Of Headmasters w.e.f 01.07.2001 whereby pay scale was revised from 4625-7000 to 6500-10500, additionally, the Selection Grade was also revised to Rs. 7500-250-12000 however, no corresponding revision was made in the pay scales of Sub-Deputy Inspectors of Schools/ Assistant Basic Shiksha Adhikaris (SDI/ABSA) and Deputy Basic Shiksha Adhikaris (DBSA) w.e.f. 01.07.2001 making their pay scales lesser than that of the Headmasters (who were amongst the feeder cadre categories for appointment by selection against 10% posts of SDI/ABSA) – Multiple rounds of litigation, various s passed by Supreme Court and High Court – In the present round of litigation, Single Judge of the High Court directed grant of pay scale of 7500-12000 to SDI/ABSA and DBSA, w.e.f 2001 – Appeal thereagainst was dismissed by Division Bench on the ground of delay: Held: There was no pay parity between Headmasters and the SDI/ABSA etc. – It was a mere coincidence that the group of * Author 1322 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports these posts carried the same pay scale for a long time, till the State Government decided to grant a higher revised pay scale to the Headmasters – This led to an anomalous situation as the Headmasters were amongst the feeder cadre categories for appointment by selection against 10% posts of SDI/ABSA – The State itself acknowledged that there was some disparity in the pay scales that needed to be rectified and constituted the Rizvi Committee which made various recommendations like merger of cadres, re-designation and upgradation of posts, the introduction of new pay scales, with an assurance that the re-designated posts would be on a pay scale higher than that of the feeder cadre to redress the grievances of employees like the Respondents and the anomalies stood removed – Appellant-State on being directed by the High Court recalibrated and recompensed the employees like Respondents and put up a proposal before Supreme Court in the previous round of litigation which was approved – State then issued s granting restructured benefits to the employees like the Respondents who also got monetary benefits over and above the State’s proposal, in furtherance of the High Court decisions dtd. 06.05.02 and 02.02.18 – Now, most of them have retired from service and are senior citizens – The monetary benefits have already been utilised by them on their personal needs – Thus, remittance of the case to the High Court is not likely to bring quietus to the endless litigation – In the case of present nature involving protracted litigation and delay, Article 142 of the Constitution invoked in the larger interest of the administration of justice and to prevent manifest injustice – Directions issued for removal of discrepancy in the pay scales prescribed for SDI/ ABSA and DBSA – Respondents entitled to the pay scale, strictly in accordance with the 2011 , notionally from 01.01.2006 and actually from 01.12.2008 – Impugned judgement of the Division Bench set aside while that of the Single Judge of the High Court is set aside in part.
