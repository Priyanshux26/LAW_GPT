Learned counsel contended that any selective relaxation would cause enormous injustice to the non-applicants, who in compliance with the rule would not have applied for the reason that they did not possess the eligibility certifi cate on the last date for submission. To reinforce the submission, reliance was placed on Ashok Kumar Sharma (supra) and Yogesh Kumar vs. GNCTD, (2003) 3 SCC 548 wherein it was held that deviation from the Rules allows entry to ineligible persons and deprives, among others, who could have competed for the post. So, contending they prayed for dismissal of the writ petitions. DIVYA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 63 [K. V. VISWANATHAN, J.] Questions for Consideration: 38. In the light of the pleadings and the contentions set out above, the following main questions arise for consideration: a) What is the eligibility criterion for a candidate to stake a valid claim under the EWS Category as per the CSE Rules, 2022 read with OM dated 19.01.2019 and 31.01.2019? b) Was the UPSC justifi ed in prescribing the cut-off date for possession and for uploading of the I&AC certifi cates in the prescribed format to stake a valid claim under the EWS category, as done in the instant case? c) Are the CSE-Rules 2022 enforceable in law? d) Are Rules 13, 27(3) and 28 of the CSE-Rules 2022 constitutionally valid? e) Was the UPSC justifi ed in rejecting the claim of the petitioners for consideration under the EWS category?

Further, Rule 28 states that a candidate seeking reservation/relaxation benefi ts available for SC/ST/ OBC/EWS/PwBd/Ex-Servicemen must ensure that they are entitled to such reservation/relaxation as per eligibility prescribed in the Rules/Notice. The Rule further states that they should also be in possession of all the requisite certifi cates in the prescribed format in support of their claim as stipulated in the Rules/Notice for such benefi ts by the closing date of the application 64 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. for Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination-2022.
