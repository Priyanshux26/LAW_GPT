…..The trial court was also wrong in holding that the report given by the Forensic Science Laboratory with 926 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports respect to the contents of MO 44 was not admissible in evidence as it was signed by its Joint Director and not by the Director. On a true construction of Section 293(4) CrPC it has to be held that Joint Director is comprehended by the expression “Director”. The amendment made in clause (e) of Section 293(4) now indicates that clearly. If the Joint Director was not comprehended within the expression Director then the legislature would have certainly named him while amending the clause and providing that Section 293 applies to the Deputy Director or Assistant Director of a Central Forensic Science Laboratory or a State Forensic Science Laboratory. A Joint Director is a higher officer than a Deputy Director or an Assistant Director and, therefore, it would be unreasonable to hold that a report signed by Joint Director is not admissible in evidence though a report signed by the Deputy Director or Assistant Director is now admissible. In our opinion the High Court was right in holding that the report made by the Joint Director was admissible in evidence and that it deserved to be relied upon.” (Emphasis Supplied) Hence, the report Ex. P-42 is admissible even without the examination of Dr. K. P. Jayakumar. (See also Bhupinder Singh v. State of Punjab, (1988) 3 SCC 513 & State of H.P. v. Mast Ram, (2004) 8 SCC 660) viii) The evidence of the doctors PWs-10 & 19, who conducted the post-mortem of Latha & Chitra respectively, fixed the timing of death between 6-18 hours prior to 6.25 PM on 04.11.2005. Evidence of PW-25, Doctor who conducted post-mortem of Ramachandran stated that the death occurred 12-18 hours prior to 6:25PM. This synchronizes with the time that the accused made entry into the house. ix) The hair strands found on the body of Chitra were found to be similar and identical to the hair of the accused. In Ext.P41(b), which is the report of Dr. R. Sreekumar, Assistant Director (Biology) in the forensic laboratory, it is opined that the hairs in Item 45 (hairs from the belly of Chitra) are human scalp hairs which are similar to the sample scalp hairs in Item 58 (a tuft [2024] 3 S.C.R. 927 Navas @ Mulanavas v. State of Kerala of black hairs) which is the combed hair and cut hair of the appellant. Challenging the circumstances, Mr. Renjith B. Marar, learned counsel, contends that PW-27 Annamma John does not speak about the hair being seized and that there was no seizure memo spoken to in her 161 statement. This submission has no merit since Exhibit P-26 is the seizure mahazar of the objects collected by PW-27 on 04.11.2005, the day the sordid incident was unravelled. In the Inquest Report also PW-14 mentions about the collection of hair from the body of the deceased Chitra by PW-27. x) It is also important to note that the 2 (two) strands of hair found on one of the knives, was found to be Latha’s as per FSL Report (Ex.
