15. According to the petitioners, due to the injustice being meted out to the persons excluded from exemption from payment of income tax, even though they were clearly permanent residents of Sikkim, the matter was debated in the Sikkim State Assembly. On 24th March, 2011, F a Cabinet Memorandum was issued stating that the Government of Sikkim felt that it was appropriate to pass a Resolution in the ensuing session of the Assembly in favour of the left-out categories of persons (including persons such as the petitioners in W.P. (C) No. 1283 of 2021, whose fathers were in Sikkim Government Service before 31st December, 1969 G and who are continuously residing in the State of Sikkim) for income tax exemption by Government of India. The Resolution was accordingly passed on 26th March, 2011. 16.

[B. V. NAGARATHNA, J.] 2013, and granted interim relief to persons such as the petitioners herein A in respect of recovery proceedings at the instance of the Income Tax Department as also qua deposit of TDS. 17. In August 2013, the Rajya Sabha published its 145th Report of the Committee on the Petition, praying for protection of interest of bona fide Indian nationals living in Sikkim prior to its merger with India in the B year 1975. In its deliberations, the Committee clearly found that old Indian settlers of Sikkim are to be treated at par with Sikkimese and should have been included in the said definition. It was recommended that exemption be granted to such persons as well. 18. On 4th April, 2018, an was passed by this Court directing C the petitioners in Writ Petition No. 59 of 2013 to place on record a list of persons who were claiming benefit of Section 10 (26AAA) of I.T.
