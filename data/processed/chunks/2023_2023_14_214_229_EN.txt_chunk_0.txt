TRIVEDI AND DIPANKAR DATTA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issues for consideration: Whether the delay of about more than one year in registering the FIR could be said to be fatal to the case of prosecution; whether the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased had died due to administration of poison and the appellant- accused administered the poison in the liquor and made the deceased to drink it on the previous date of his death. Penal Code, 1860 – s.302 – Allegation of murder by poisoning – Delay in registering FIR – When not fatal: Held: FIR being only a corroborative piece of evidence and not a substantive piece of evidence, mere delay in registering the FIR could not be held to be a ground adverse to the case of prosecution – In the present case, though the FIR was registered against the appellant on 03.11.2004 in respect of the incident which had taken place on 22.07.2003, a part of investigation had already started on the death of the deceased and on the Merg intimation no.43/03 – The explanation off ered by the prosecution that the FIR was not registered as the cause of death was not stated by the Doctor who carried out the post-mortem and the report of Chemical examiner was awaited, seems to be reasonable and acceptable – It was the report of Chemical examination sent by the FSL, after one year, which caused the delay in the registration of the FIR – Thus, the entire delay as such could be attributed to the FSL which took almost one year in giving the report of Chemical examination of Viscera of the deceased – There was no mala fi de intention on the part of any of the witnesses or the police not to register the FIR or to delay the registration of FIR – Further, on facts, having regard to the scanty evidence, it is diffi cult 214 HARIPRASAD @ KISHAN SAHU v.

[Paras 17, 18, 26 and 28] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.32 – Dying Declaration: Held: Though a statement made by a person who is dying is made exception to the rule of hearsay and has been made admissible in evidence u/s.32 – It would not be prudent to base conviction, relying upon such dying declaration alone – In the instant case, even if the so-called dying declaration of the deceased is believed, at the most it could be said that the deceased on 22.07.2003 had consumed liquor along with ‘HR’ and others, and that in the third glass of liquor, ‘HR’ had mixed some herb, and made the deceased to drink it – There is no evidence to show as to what kind of herb was allegedly mixed by ‘HR’, and whether such herb was poisonous or not – Chemical examination report of the Senior Scientifi c Offi cer, FSL (Ex.
