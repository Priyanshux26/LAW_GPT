Counsel relied on the amendment to the C ADE Act, by Finance Act, 2001, which inserted Entry 8404.49 as the species of the genus “Chewing Tobacco” to read as under: “Chewing Tobacco and preparations containing Chewing Tobacco; Pan Masala Containing Tobacco D 8404.41…. 8404.49 Pan Masala Containing Tobacco” 35. A comparison of the above and the parent Entry 4 to the First Schedule to the CEA, 1944 shows that “Chewing Tobacco” was the E genus and “Pan Masala Containing Tobacco” commonly known as “gutkha” was a species of chewing tobacco. Therefore, it was always covered under the original definition and formed part of Entry 14 of the Schedule to the UPTT Act (as well as Sl. No. 22 of the Third Schedule to the DST Act). F 36. Mr. Agarwal argued that the levy of tax is under Section 3 of the UPTT Act while the rate of tax is provided in Section 3A. Section 4 of the Act empowers the State government to grant exemption. From a reading of Sections 3A and 3D it is manifest that the rate of tax on declared goods cannot be more than the rate which is provided in Section 15 of the CST Act. Legislatively, therefore, restrictions enacted under G Section 15 of the CST Act have been recognized in Sections 3A and 3D 24 Narottamdas v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors [1964] 7 SCR 820; Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vasantrao & Ors (2002) 7 SCC 657; and Girnar Traders (3) v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. [2011] 3 SCR 1 25 [1998] 2 Suppl. SCR 119: (1998) 7 SCC 228 H 1068 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A of the UPTT Act. It is important to note that the State has not relied on any notification prescribing rate of tax on “Pan masala containing tobacco” in these cases. “Pan masala containing tobacco” has been taxed as an ‘unclassified item’ or what can be termed as a ‘residuary entry’. Thus, the question posed was whether the pan masala containing tobacco i.e., “gutkha” is taxable as declared goods under Entry 14(ix) B of the CST Act or as an unclassified item or in the residuary entry. 37. It was submitted that “Pan masala containing tobacco” is a chewing tobacco for several reasons. One, the entry has to be read as widely as possible and any form of “chewing tobacco” including any of its preparations will form part of that entry. Two, gutkha is essentially a C preparation of chewing tobacco and what makes it distinct from plain Pan masala are its essential characteristics i.e., tobacco (which is in gutkha). Three, it is a settled principle of classification that it is not a percentage of a particular item in the commodity which will determine the nature of product. Four, undisputedly “gutkha” is sold by the appellant D PJ Aromatics under a brand name “Jeet”. Therefore, it was urged that it will fall in entry 2404.41 which is specifically covered under Section 14(ix). 38.
