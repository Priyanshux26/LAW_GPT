Ltd – accused No. 1. The said ICD were for Rs. 50,00,000/-, each to be repaid by 15th May H PRAKASH AGGARWAL v. GANESH BENZOPLAST LIMITED 847 AND ANOTHER [B. R. GAVAI, J.] 2000 and 5th June 2000. As per the ICD, security cover of 200% of the A ICD amount was to be maintained. Accordingly, the complainant/ respondent No.1 executed a Letter of Pledge (for short, “LoP”) in favour of accused No.1 Company, pledging 15,00,000 of its equity shares as security, with each share valued at Rs. 16/-, thereby amounting to Rs. 2,40,00,000/-. B 3.2. Prakash Aggarwal, Meera Goyal and Suresh Chand Goyal, appellants herein, who were Directors of accused No. 1 Company, were responsible for the management of its day to day affairs. They were arraigned as accused Nos. 2 to 4 in the original complaint. 3.3. On 3rd May 2000, accused No.1 Company issued a notice to C the complainant/respondent No.1 asking it to pledge additional shares as the value of the pledged shares had decreased to Rs. 1,24,50,000/- on account of depression in the financial market, thereby, resulting in a shortfall of Rs. 75,50,000/- from the agreed security cover i.e. 200% of the ICD amount. D 3.4. Due to financial hardship, the complainant/respondent No.1 was not in a position to repay the ICD amount on 5th June 2000, i.e. the due date, and therefore, it informed accused No.1 Company that it could sell the pledged shares to realize the due amount, and remit the excess amount to the complainant/respondent No.1. Thereafter, accused No.1 E Company assured the complainant/respondent No.1 that, as and when the shares were sold, the balance amount, if any, would be remitted to it. 3.5. On 25th August 2000, the complainant/respondent No.1 repaid the first ICD and the loan account was closed. 3.6. It is pertinent to note that the interest that was being charged F on ICD was being regularly recovered by accused No. 1 Company uptill 6th August 2001. In the meanwhile, the complainant/respondent No.1 was in constant communication with the accused No.1 Company, seeking the details of the sale of shares. However, these requests were rebuffed, with accused No.1 Company asking the complainant/respondent No.1 not to confuse the issue of sale of shares with the issue of interest on G ICD. 3.7. On 2nd August 2001, accused No.1 Company issued another notice to the complainant/respondent No.1, demanding the repayment of the ICD of Rs. 50,00,000/- as the value of the pledged shares had fallen to Rs. 44,25,000/-, failing which the pledged shares would be sold.

Subsequently, on 14th August 2001, complainant/respondent No.1 proposed to repay Rs. 25,00,000/- initially in five equal monthly installments, with the first installment to be paid on or before 25th August 2001. However, on the same day, accused No.1 Company invoked the arbitration clause in the ICD agreement and appointed a Sole Arbitrator, claiming the outstanding amount due from the complainant/respondent B No.1. 3.9.
