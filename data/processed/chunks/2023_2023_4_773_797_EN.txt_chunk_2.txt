M/s A.J. Infrastructures Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of H.P. and others CWP No. 306/2007 dated 7th September, 2007 – referred to. G 1.3 From the excerpt of the impugned and of the High Court dated 2nd January, 2008 it is clear that proceedings were not initiated upon notice to the defaulters and the sum they owed to the department had not been finally determined 28 in accordance with law. In view thereof, question H 776 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A of the State resorting to the provisions contained in Chapter VI of the HPLR Act for recovering the dues, if at all, as arrears of land revenue did not arise.The State and its department either overlooked or were ignorant of the requirement of law that section 16-B would be attracted only after determination of the liability and upon any sum becoming due and payable; and that, it is only B thereafter that the charge, if any, would operate. No relevant documentary evidence having been placed before the High Court, when CWP 306 of 2007 was being heard, to indicate that necessary steps under the HPGST Act had been initiated by the State and its officers, the third issue has to be answered by holding that the C State not having taken steps as required by law for realization of its dues, there was no determination of liability, a fortiori, question of taking recourse to the HPLR Act for recovery of dues as arrears of land revenue did not arise. Without such determination of liability, no red entry marks could have been inserted in the revenue records and the High Court was right in holding that the D State ought not to have refused mutation.The appellants (State and its officers) are not entitled to any relief except the declaration that section 16-B of the HPGST Act is not ultra vires any provision of law. In view of section 16-B having been outlawed by the High Court on 2nd January, 2008, this declaration shall E not enure to the benefit of the State in respect of cases that are old and have been closed but would be effective once again from this ay.
