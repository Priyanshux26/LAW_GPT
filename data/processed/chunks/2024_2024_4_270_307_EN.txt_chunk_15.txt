Digital Supreme Court Reports prevail, unless overcome or disproved by other evidence, and on the face of it, materials must show complicity of such accused in the commission of the stated offences. What this ratio contemplates is that on the face of it, the accusation against the accused ought to prevail. In our opinion, however, it would not satisfy the prima facie “test” unless there is at least surface-analysis of probative value of the evidence, at the stage of examining the question of granting bail and the quality or probative value satisfies the Court of its worth………” 23. We must point out here that Mr. Nataraj has taken a fair stand in this case and in response to our query on necessity of detention of the appellant at this stage, for further investigation, he has submitted that the prosecution at present would not require custody of the appellant for such purpose. He has simultaneously emphasised on gravity and seriousness of the offences alleged against the appellant and submitted that the question of entitlement of the appellant to be enlarged on bail would have to be examined in the light of the bail restricting clause of Section 43D (5) of the 1967 Act and on that basis, he has contested the appeal. We shall first examine the applicability of the offences contained in Chapters IV and VI in relation to the materials which have been disclosed before us and then go on to apply the normal principle of granting bail, only on our satisfaction that the materials disclosed before us do not establish reasonable grounds for believing that the accusations against the appellant under the bail restricting provisions of the 1967 Act are prima facie true.
