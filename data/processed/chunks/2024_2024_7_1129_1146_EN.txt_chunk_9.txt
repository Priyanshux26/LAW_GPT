6 SCR 512 : (2006) 8 SCC 381 17 [1996] Suppl. 2 SCR 662 : (1996) 5 SCC 268 1142 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports necessary, for the public good. This underscores the principle that while legitimate expectation warrants fair treatment, it does not preclude the government’s flexibility in policy-making. 23. Therefore, the doctrine of legitimate expectation serves only as a procedural safeguard ensuring fairness in administrative decisions and policy changes. It grants the expectant party the right to a fair hearing and an explanation but does not guarantee the realization of the expected benefit. The government’s authority to revise policies in public interest remains paramount, with the judiciary intervening only in cases of arbitrariness, unreasonableness, or lack of public interest. This balanced approach ensures that while individuals can expect consistent treatment based on past practices or promises, the government retains the flexibility to respond to evolving needs and priorities. 24. On the doctrine of promissory estoppel, since it is an equitable doctrine, it only comes into play when equity requires a party be estopped from withdrawing its promise. It has been well settled by this Court in several s that the principle of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked against the exercise of legislative power. In to avoid burden on the present , we are relying on the observations made by this Court in a recent dealing with the doctrine of promissory estoppel. The Bench in Hero Motocorp Ltd vs Union of India,18 while relying upon other s of this Court in this regard, observed thus (SCC pp. 414-415, para 68) “68. A common thread in all these s that could be noticed is that all these s consistently hold that there can be no estoppel against the legislature in the exercise of its legislative functions. The Constitution Bench in the case of M. Ramanatha Pillai (supra) has approved the view in American Jurisprudence that the doctrine of estoppel will not be applied against the State in its governmental, public or sovereign capacity. It further held that the only exception with regard to applicability of the doctrine of estoppel is where it is necessary to prevent fraud or manifest injustice. The analysis of all the s of this Court on the issue would reveal 18 [2022] 13 SCR 592 : (2023) 1 SCC 386 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1143 M/S Rewa Tollway P. Ltd. v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. that it is a consistent view of this Court, reiterated again in Godfrey Philips India Ltd. (supra), that there can be no promissory estoppel against the legislature in the exercise of its legislative functions.” 25. In light of the observations made by this Court in the above cited s and several others, it is an evident position of law that a prior executive decision does not bar the State legislature from enacting a law or framing any policy contrary to or in conflict with the previous executive decision in furtherance of larger public interest. Nor can it be canvassed that the law laid down by the legislature would be hit by principle of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation because earlier the executive had expressed its view differently.
