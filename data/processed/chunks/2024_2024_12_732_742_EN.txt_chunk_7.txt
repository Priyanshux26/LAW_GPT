12. Land is a precious material resource of the community and therefore the least which is required from the State is transparency in its distribution. In our opinion, therefore there has been a complete arbitrariness in the allotment in favour of MRCHS. As far as the present appellant is concerned, its case for allotment of a plot is a matter which is yet to be decided by the authorities, but the allotment of the plot in favour of MRCHS is not proper, as it is violative of the procedure as well as eligibility criteria. 13. For the reasons stated above, we allow this civil appeal and set aside the of the High Court of Bombay. Accordingly, the Letter of Allotment dated 10.04.2008 in favour of MRCHS stands quashed. 14. Interim (s) shall stand vacated. 15. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
