[2023] 14 S.C.R. 412 : 2023 INSC 811 CASE DETAILS K. HYMAVATHI v. THE STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH & ANR. (Criminal Appeal No.2743 of 2023) SEPTEMBER 06, 2023 [A. S. BOPANNA AND PRASHANT KUMAR MISHRA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: High Court if justifi ed in quashing the criminal proceedings fi led by appellant against respondent No.2-accused u/ss.138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 holding that it was a fi t case for quashing since the complaint fi led seeking prosecution was not in respect of a legally recoverable debt. Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – Debt if legally enforceable – Exercise of power u/s. 482, CrPC – Scope: Held: Whether the debt in question is a legally enforceable debt or other liability would arise on the facts and circumstance of each case and in that light, the question as to whether the power u/s.482, CrPC is to be exercised or not will also arise in the facts of such case – In the present case, High Court misdirected itself in holding that since the date of issuance of the cheque (2017) is beyond three years from the date of issuance of the promissory note (2012) so it is a time-barred debt – When the respondent had agreed to repay the amount within December, 2016, the cause of action to initiate proceedings to recover the said amount if not paid within December 2016 would arise only in the month of December, 2016 – Thus, the limitation would be as provided under Article 34 to the Schedule in the Limitation Act, 1963 – In respect of a promissory note payable at a fi xed time, the period of limitation being three years would begin to run when the fi xed time expires – Therefore, the time would begin to run from the month of December, 2016 and the period of limitation would expire at the end of three years thereto i.e. during December, 2019 – Thus, the cheque 412 K. HYMAVATHI v. THE STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH & 413 ANR. dated 28.04.2017 is well within the period of limitation – Complaint in CC No.681 of 2017 was fi led on 11.07.2017, as is the case in all the analogous complaints – Therefore, not only the amount was a legally recoverable debt, the complaint was also fi led within time – No occasion to exercise power u/s.482, CrPC to quash the complaint – impugned set aside – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.482 – Contract Act, 1872 – s.25(3) – Limitation Act, 1963 – Article 34. [Paras 12, 13, 15-17] Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – Debt/liability if barred by limitation, to be decided on evidence – Quashing u/s.482, CrPC justifi ed only if debt is non-recoverable: Held: Whether the debt or liability is barred by limitation is to be decided based on the evidence to be adduced since the question of limitation is a mixed question of law and fact – It is only in cases wherein an amount which is out and out non-recoverable, towards which a cheque is issued, dishonoured and for recovery of which a criminal action is initiated, the question of threshold jurisdiction will arise – In such cases, the Court exercising jurisdiction u/s.482, CrPC will be justifi ed in interfering but not otherwise – Entertaining a petition u/s.482, CrPC to quash the proceedings at the stage earlier to the evidence would not be justifi ed – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.482.
