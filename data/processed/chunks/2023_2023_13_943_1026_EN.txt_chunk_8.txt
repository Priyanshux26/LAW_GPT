22. In the last, it was argued that any passed by this Court under Section 11(6) of the Act 1996 cannot be treated as a binding precedent in view of the decision of this Court in State of West Bengal and Others v. Associated Contractors reported in (2015) 1 SCC 32. 23. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent prayed that there being no merit in the petition, the same be rejected. LOMBARDI ENGINEERING LTD. v. UTTARAKHAND JAL 955 VIDYUT NIGAM LTD. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] ANAYLSIS 24. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the following issues fall for the consideration of this Court: (i) Whether the dictum as laid down in ICOMM Tele Limited (supra) can be made applicable to the case in hand more particularly when Clause 55 of the General Conditions of Contract provides for a pre-deposit of 7% of the total claim for the purpose of invoking the arbitration clause? (ii) Whether there is any direct confl ict between the decisions of this Court in S.K. Jain (supra) and ICOMM Tele Limited (supra)? (iii) Whether this Court while deciding a petition fi led under Section 11(6) of the Act 1996 for appointment of a sole arbitrator can hold that the condition of pre-deposit stipulated in the arbitration clause as provided in the Contract is violative of the Article 14 of the Constitution of India being manifestly arbitrary? (iv) Whether the arbitration Clause No. 55 of the Contract empowering the Principal Secretary/Secretary (Irrigation), State of Uttarakhand to appoint an arbitrator of his choice is in confl ict with the decision of this Court in the case of Perkins Eastman (supra)? JURISDICTION OF THE COURT UNDER SECTION 11(6) OF THE ACT 1996 25. In the wake of a few decisions of this Court, the legislature thought fi t to add sub section (6A) to Section 11 of the Act 1996 by way of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as “Amendment 2015”). The same reads thus: “(6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under subsection (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6), shall, notwithstanding any , decree or of any court, confi ne to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.” (Emphasis supplied) 956 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 26. Taking cognizance of the legislative change, this Court in Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Limited reported in (2017) 9 SCC 729, noted that post the 2015 Amendment, the jurisdiction of the court under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 is limited to examining whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties - “nothing more, nothing less”. 27. The entire case law on the subject was considered by a three- judge bench of this Court in Vidya Drolia and Others v. Durga Trading Corporation reported in (2021) 2 SCC 1, and an overarching principle with respect to the pre-referral jurisdiction under Section 11(6) of the Act was laid down.
