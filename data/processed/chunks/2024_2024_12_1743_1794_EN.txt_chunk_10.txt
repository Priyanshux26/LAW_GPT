However, those accused persons are not accused in the FIR registered against the petitioner herein. In the absence 1758 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of there being any connection either with the accused against whom offences have been registered by the Gujarat State Police or with any Scheduled Offence being registered against the petitioner herein, Section 8 of the NIA Act could not have been invoked against the petitioner as if he had committed a Scheduled Offence. 4.2 Referring to Section 8, learned Senior Counsel Sri Dave submitted that the said Section would be available only when an accused who has been investigated for a Scheduled Offence can also be investigated for any other offence which the accused is alleged to have committed only if the other offence is connected with the Scheduled Offence. In the instant case, the petitioner was not being investigated by the Punjab State Police for any Scheduled Offence but for non-scheduled offences under the provisions of the NDPS Act. The petitioner was not being investigated in respect of FIR No.01/2018 dated 12.08.2018 registered at PS ATS, Ahmedabad, Gujarat which is also in respect of non-scheduled offences. However, while handing over the investigation of the aforesaid FIR to the NIA, the Central Government by dated 29.6.2020 invoked Sections 17 and 18 of the UAPA to connect the offences under the NDPS Act (non-scheduled offences) in to enable the investigation of the accused named in FIR No.1/2018 dated 12.08.2018 registered at PS ATS, Ahmedabad, Gujarat for offences under the NDPS Act as well as under Sections 17 and 18 UAPA Act which are Scheduled Offences. It appears that while carrying out the investigation pursuant to dated 29.6.2020 (Annexure P-4), the NIA forwarded reports to the Central Government with regard to FIR No.23/2020 dated 31.01.2020 at Police Station STF, District STF Wing, Amritsar, Punjab as well as FIR No.20/2020 dated 29.01.2020 registered at PS STF SAS Nagar, Mohali, Punjab against the petitioner herein and consequently, under Section 8 of the NIA Act, s at Annexures P-6 and P-9 have been passed by invoking the offences under the UAPA also against the petitioner herein. It was submitted that such a procedure is impermissible in the absence of there being any link or connection between the accused persons in FIR No.1/2018 dated 12.08.2018 at PS ATS, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, registered under certain provisions [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1759 Ankush Vipan Kapoor v. National Investigation Agency of the NDPS Act and FIR No.23/2020 dated 31.01.2020 at Police Station STF, District STF Wing, Amritsar, Punjab as well as FIR No.20/ 2020 dated 29.01.2020 registered at PS STF, SAS Nagar, Mohali, Punjab registered under certain provisions of the NDPS Act against the petitioner herein. 4.3 It was further submitted that offences alleged against the petitioner herein under the NDPS Act do not relate to the persons accused by the Gujarat State Police and therefore there is no connection of the petitioner with any Scheduled Offence. It was submitted that the Scheduled Offences have been invoked as against the persons accused by the Gujarat Police at the time of handing over of the investigation to the NIA but the same could not have been replicated insofar as the petitioner herein is concerned.
