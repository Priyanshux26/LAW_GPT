This implies that the said is per se per incuriam. (viii) This Court went on to hold that the High Court of Bombay had declined to interfere in Criminal Writ Petition No.305 of 2013 filed by the co-accused Ramesh Rupabhai by its dated 05.08.2013 without realising what the prayer in the said writ petition was, which was filed in the year 2013, as at that point of time, the issue of remission had not arisen at all. The Bombay High Court had declined to entertain the Writ Petition filed by one of the convicts by holding to consider his plea for transfer to a jail in State of Gujarat. (ix) Interestingly, no review petition was filed against the of this Court dated 13.05.2022 by the State of Gujarat for seeking a review of the said but the victim – petitioner in Writ Petition (Crl.) No.491 of 2022 – had filed a review petition which has been rejected by this Court. (x) that although the respondent No.3 who approached this Court as well as the State of Gujarat had termed the of the Gujarat High Court dated 17.07.2019 as “impugned [2024] 1 S.C.R. 855 Bilkis Yakub Rasool v. Union of India & Others ”, the said was not at all impugned or assailed in the proceedings before this Court. What was filed by the convict i.e., respondent No.3 before this Court was a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution seeking a direction to the State of Gujarat to consider his remission application; (xi) More significantly, while a reference has been made to Criminal Writ Petition No.305 of 2013 filed by one of the co-accused Ramesh Rupabhai in the year 2013 before the Bombay High Court seeking a direction for transfer of the convicts from Maharashtra Jail to Gujarat Jail, the reference to the of the Gujarat High Court dated 17.07.2019 dismissing the writ petition filed by respondent No.3 herein directing him to approach the Maharashtra State for remission was only in the context of the said being “diametrically opposite” to the view of the Bombay High Court without explaining and by suppression of the backgrounds under which the two writ petitions were filed before the respective High Court. (xii) In fact, there was no pleading or prayer for seeking setting aside of the Gujarat High Court dated 17.07.2019 nor was there any challenge to the said . That said had attained finality as no Special Leave Petition as against the said was filed by the writ petitioner, Radheshyam Bhagwandas Shah respondent No.3 herein before this Court; rather he had acted upon it. Curiously, in the writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, the dated 17.07.2019 has been set aside even in the absence of there being any prayer thereto nor any discussion of the same. (xiii) Further, contrary to Section 432 (7) and the judgements of the Constitution Bench and other benches of this Court, a writ of mandamus was issued to the State of Gujarat to consider the prayer of the writ petitioner for premature release in terms of its policy dated 09.07.1992.
