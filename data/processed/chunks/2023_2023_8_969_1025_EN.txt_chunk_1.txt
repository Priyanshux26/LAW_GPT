can be handed over to the beneficiary D company – If the lands in question are continued to be acquired by the beneficiary company, the control of the rivers would be with the said private company, which would violate the Doctrine of Public Trust – Further, there is a Wildlife Sanctuary, just adjacent across the road to the proposed university and the lands acquired – Therefore, large-scale construction for establishment of the proposed E university as observed by the High Court will also adversely affect the Wildlife Sanctuary, entire Eco system and the ecological environment in the locality – Even otherwise, there is non-application on part of the State Government on the requirement of the lands by the beneficiary company – From the material on record, it appears F that undue benefits were proposed / in fact offered and given to the beneficiary company providing undue largesse – It is not appreciable why the Government offered such an undue favour to one trust/ company – Thus, the entire acquisition proceedings and the benefits, proposed by the State Government were vitiated by favourism and violative of Art.14 of the Constitution – High Court was justified in G setting aside the entire acquisition proceedings, which was vitiated by non-compliance of the statutory provisions under the Act, 1894 and the Rules, 1963 and also vitiated by mala fides and favourism and is a clear case of the non-application of mind on relevant aspects – Constitution of India – Art. 14.
