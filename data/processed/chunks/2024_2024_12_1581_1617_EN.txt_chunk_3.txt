1,70,40,720.80 instead of Rs. 1,70,70,720.80, further clarifying that the above correction would form part of the award dated 16.12.1997. 7. Respondent filed an execution petition being Ex.P. No. 99/1998 under Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (briefly ‘the 1996 Act’ hereinafter) before the Single Bench of the High Court for execution of the arbitral award. Learned Single Judge vide the dated 26.08.2004 framed the following issue for consideration: Whether post award interest under Section 31(7) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 would be calculated on the principal sum adjudged or would it be calculated on 1586 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the principal sum plus interest on the principal sum which has accrued from the date of cause of action to date of passing of award, as under the new 1996 Act, award is enforced as a decree of the court. 8. Simultaneously, appellant also filed before the Single Bench a petition under Section 34 of the 1996 Act challenging the award dated 16.12.1997. By dated 08.01.2002, the petition of the appellant under Section 34 of the 1996 Act was dismissed. 9. Appellant then preferred an appeal under Section 37 of the 1996 Act before the Division Bench assailing the dated 08.01.2002 being FAO(OS) No. 89/2002. The said appeal was, however, dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court by the and dated 14.03.2002. 10. Being aggrieved by the dated 14.03.2002, appellant filed a special leave petition before this Court being SLP(C) No. 7474/2002. Though this Court had initially issued notice and granted limited stay qua execution of the award vis-à-vis claim Nos. 22, 25 and 26, the said special leave petition was subsequently dismissed by this Court on 03.02.2010. 11. Reverting back to the execution petition filed by the respondent, learned Single Judge vide the dated 26.08.2004 after framing the issue as above expressed the view that post-award interest under Section 31(7) of the 1996 Act affects a large volume of litigation before the court. Therefore, in to avoid proliferation of litigation and unnecessary appeals, learned Single Judge referred the matter to the Division Bench to clarify the position in this regard. 12. When the matter was placed before the Division Bench, respondent sought leave to approach the learned Arbitrator for seeking the clarification as to whether the interest awarded in the award was under Section 31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act or not? Division Bench vide the dated 03.01.2005 granted such permission to the respondent with the clarification that the permission so granted should not be understood to contain any expression of opinion of the Division Bench about payment of interest under Section 31(7)(a) or Section 31(7)(b) of the 1996 Act. 13. Pursuant thereto, an application was filed by the respondent before the learned Arbitrator seeking clarification in terms of the dated [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1587 North Delhi Municipal Corporation v. M/s. S.A. Builders Ltd. 03.01.2005. It was contended on behalf of the respondent that though under sub-Section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act interest can be awarded, Arbitral Tribunal, however, had not clarified as to whether the said interest was awarded under clause (a) of sub-Section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act or not.
