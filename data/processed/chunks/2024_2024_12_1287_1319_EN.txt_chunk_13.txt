Judicial s are to be properly understood and complied with, even negligence and carelessness can amount to disobedience particularly when the attention of the person is drawn to the Court’s and its implications. In the instant case respondents being aware of the consequences of non-implementation of the of this Court dated 21.11.2014 had sought for modification on the ground of financial 5 [2007] 3 SCR 816 : (2007) 11 SCC 374 1306 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports hardship and had also failed. Hence, they are estopped from feigning ignorance for not implementing the s of this Court or not being aware of the consequences of its implementations. 11. In the Writ Petition No. 6585 of 2020 aforestated which was pending before the High Court of Karnataka, the State Government dragged its feet by taking adjournment after adjournment on one pretext or the other and had projected a picture of its earnestness to implement the s of this Court, though parallelly it had resiled from its earlier dated 17.07.2019 by issuance of Government dated 23.02.2021 and later filed I.A. No. 98276 of 2021 on 12.08.2021 for modification of dated 21.11.2014 which ended in its dismissal also on 17.05.2022. It would be apposite to note that by Government No. UDD 269 MNY 2018 dated 08.12.2022 it was resolved to drop the proposal for widening of the roads itself and as such BBMP withdrew the proposal made to the State Government on 30.03.2009 in this regard which came to be accepted by Government dated 08.12.2022. Strangely and curiously it may be noted that the BBMP took a contrary stand before the High Court in the pending Writ Petition No.6585 of 2020 by filing affidavits which reflected about the progress of the steps taken by BBMP to widen the road or in other words, State and its authorities or instrumentalities were blowing hot and cold. On the one hand State was depicting a picture before the High Court of implementing the s of this Court and simultaneously State and its authorities were filing application for modification of the passed in 2014 and parallelly assuring the High Court that it was keen on implementing the s of this Court, though it was postponing the implementation and dragging its feet on one pretext or the other and eventually shelved the proposal to widen the road, though substantial progress had been made to widen the road for which purpose possession of land had also been taken. 12. Turning our attention to the core issue on hand namely as to whether there has been compliance of the dated 21.11.2014 and 17.05.2022 by the respondents, we will have to answer it in the negative and also further hold that there has been wilful disobedience, for the reasons assigned hereinbelow: “(i). In compliance of the dated 21.11.2014 a communication came to be issued by the Special Deputy Commissioner Land Acquisition and TDR BBMP requesting the applicants to provide an indemnity bond following which [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1307 Chaduranga Kanthraj Urs and Anr.
