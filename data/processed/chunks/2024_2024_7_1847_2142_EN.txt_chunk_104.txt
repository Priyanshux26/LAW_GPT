In the 134th meeting of GEAC dated 21.03.2018, the proposal was referred back to GEAC for re-examination. GEAC also advised the applicant to undertake field demonstration on transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 in an area of five acres at two-three different locations, with a view to generate [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2021 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. additional data on honey bees and other pollinators and on soil microbial diversity. x. The proposal came up for re-examination by GEAC in its 136th meeting dated 20.09.2018, wherein GEAC accorded permission for conducting field demonstration studies at two locations of up to five acres each in PAU, Ludhiana and IARI, New Delhi. xi. In the 137th meeting of GEAC dated 20.03.2019, GEAC deferred field demonstration studies to the seasons 2019-20 and 2020-21. xii. Thereafter, Prof. Deepak Pental, vide letter dated 10.05.2022 requested the MoEF&CC to okay the environmental release of GE mustard. xiii. GEAC sought comments from the DBT and the DARE. Both opined that GEAC may consider exempting additional field demonstration studies. xiv. In the 146th meeting of GEAC held on 25.08.2022, GEAC recommended that a nine-member expert committee be constituted to examine the request letter dated 10.05.2022 with respect to availability of adequate evidence about the impact of transgenic mustard on honey bees and other pollinators in to assess the need for conducting field demonstration studies. xv. The abovesaid sub-committee met on 23.09.2022 and 30.09.2022 and submitted recommendations to GEAC, stating that the field demonstration studies may be conducted even after the environmental release of GE mustard. xvi. Finally, GEAC, in its 147th meeting held on 18.10.2022, recommended environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, which came to be accepted by the Central Government on 25.10.2022. 16.4 It is further averred that the production of seeds of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 would take place under the supervision of ICAR, as per existing guidelines and other extant rules and regulations. As a precautionary measure, the data with regard 2022 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports to the impact of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 on honey bees and other pollinators is to be generated during these two years of supervision by ICAR and approval could be revoked under Rule 13 (2) of the 1989 Rules, if any harmful effects are found. In addition, during the period of approval, a PRMC would visit the growing sites at least once during each season and submit its report to GEAC. Only after this elaborate process would the commercial cultivation of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 start. Commercial cultivation, too, shall be subject to the Seeds Act, 1966 and the rules and regulations made thereunder.
