The Investigating Agency and the trial court, thus, failed to observe the mandate of law, and acted in a manner which was manifestly C arbitrary and violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the accused. 34.Even at the cost of repetition, we find it pertinent to mention that the right of default bail under Section 167(2) of the CrPC is not merely a statutory right, but a fundamental right that flows from Article D 21 of the Constitution of India. The reason for such importance being given to a seemingly insignificant procedural formality is to ensure that no accused person is subject to unfettered and arbitrary power of the state. The process of remand and custody, in their practical manifestations, create a huge disparity of power between the investigating authority and the accused. While there is no doubt in our minds that arrest and remand E are extremely crucial for the smooth functioning of the investigation authority for the purpose of attaining justice, however, it is also extremely important to be cognizant of a power imbalance. Therefore, it becomes essential to place certain checks and balances upon the Investigation Agency in to prevent the harassment of accused persons at their F hands. 35.With the above findings and conclusions, the interim of bail passed in favor of the accused is made absolute, and the present writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of.
