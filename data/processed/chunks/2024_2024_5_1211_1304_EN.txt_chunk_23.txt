The appellants in this regard placed reliance on various decisions of this Court including Collector (LA), Anantnag v. Katiji,14 G. Ramegowda v. Spl. Land Acquisition Officer,15 State of Manipur v. Koting Lamkang,16 and Sheo Raj Singh v. Union of India.17 (e) The appellants could not file the appeals on time because the Court was frowning upon the filing of multiple fresh SLPs despite the law having been settled in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra), and was imposing costs while dismissing such SLPs. (f) In various cases such as Imrat Lal v. LAC,18 this Court has held that delay can be condoned in the interest of justice. In the present case also, the Court should condone the delay in public interest and subserve the cause of justice as the acquisition proceedings were undertaken for projects of eminent public importance like the expansion of the metro, construction of flyovers, hospitals, etc. 13 [2008] 13 SCR 421 : (2008) 14 SCC 171, para 35. 14 [1987] 2 SCR 387 : (1987) 2 SCC 107, para 3. 15 [1988] 3 SCR 198 : (1988) 2 SCC 142, para 17. 16 [2019] 13 SCR 565 : (2019) 10 SCC 408, para 8. 17 [2023] 13 SCR 743 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1278, para 11. 18 (2014) 14 SCC 133, para 11. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1241 Delhi Development Authority v. Tejpal & Ors. 6. Per contra, the respondent-land owners vociferously argued that the appellants have failed to showcase sufficient cause in filing the appeals and applications with enormous delay and that: (a) It is false to claim that the landowners had suppressed material facts during the proceedings in the High Court. Alternatively, even if some of the landowners did suppress the facts, these were only a handful of instances that could not be used for condoning delay in all the appeals and applications. (b) Delay cannot be condoned based on subsequent change of law. If it were to be allowed as a legitimate ground for condonation of delay, no proceedings would ever reach finality because cases could be re-opened whenever a question of law were to be interpreted differently. Further, Shailendra (supra) and Manoharlal (supra) could not be applied retrospectively, since overruling of cases relying on Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association (supra) took away only their precedential effect and did not re- open the lis between the parties in those cases. The respondents have in this regard relied upon various decisions of this Court including Neelima Srivastava v. State of UP19 and Natural Resources Allocation, In re, Special Reference 1 of 2012.20 (c) There should be parity between private parties and government entities with respect to the yardstick to be applied for condonation of delay and no leeway should be granted to the latter (relied on, inter alia, Postmaster General v. Living Media India Ltd)21. (d) This Court has made it clear in Sagufa Ahmed v. Upper Assam Plywood Products (P) Ltd.,22 that the relaxation on account of COVID-19 can be granted only in those cases where the limitation period expired during COVID-19.
