The Companies Act, 1956 and subsequent 10 Press Information Bureau, Press Release, July 23, 1999 11 (1897) AC 22, 38 SHAKTI YEZDANI & ANR. v. JAYANAND JAYANT 713 SALGAONKAR & ORS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] amendments as parliamentary legislations are rooted in Entry 43, List I of Seventh Schedule, which deals with incorporation, regulation and winding up of corporations. There is no mention of nomination and/or succession within the provisions or the statement of objects & reasons or any other material pertaining to the Companies Act, 1956. Same is also not seen in subsequent amendments to the Act. 23. Reading the provision of nomination within the Companies Act, 1956 with the broadest possible contours, it is not possible to say that the same deals with the matter of succession in any manner. There is no material to show that the intent of the legislature behind introducing a method of nomination through the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1999 was to confer absolute title of ownership of property/shares, on the said nominee. 24. In fact, while interpreting other enactments that are similar in nature by virtue of the fact that the provision of nomination within the statute begins with a non-obstante clause and/or is armed with the term ‘vest’ such as the (Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Government Savings Certifi cate Act, 1959 and/or the Employees Provident Fund Act, 1952), multiple courts have rejected the argument that the nominee would become the absolute owner to the exclusion of the legal heirs. To hold otherwise would, in our opinion, exceed the scope and extent of S. 109A of the Companies Act, 1956. NOMINATION UNDER VARIOUS LEGISLATIONS 25. In an illuminating list of precedents, this Court as well as several High Courts have dealt with the concept of ‘nomination’ under legislations like the Government Savings Certifi cate Act 1959, the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Life Insurance Act, 1939 and the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. It would be apposite to refer to what the Court said on nomination, in reference to these legislations: Case Law/Precedent Held Sarbati Devi & Anr. v.
