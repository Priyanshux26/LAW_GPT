10. Whether the other benefi ts as provided by ISO certifi ed Companies are justifi ed to be provided to the workmen of this Company?” 11. A perusal of the aforesaid issues which were referred by the Labour Commissioner to the Labour Court shows that these pertain primarily to the wages and allowances which exclusively fall within the jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal, in case more than 100 workmen are to be aff ected. 12. In this light, the stand taken by the appellants-Management is that in the establishment of the appellants-Management, there were more than 100 workmen, hence, reference of the dispute to the Labour Court was without jurisdiction and consequently, any award passed by the Labour Court is not sustainable. When the matter was being adjudicated by the Labour Court, the appellants-Management raised a preliminary objection regarding its jurisdiction, for which an additional issue was also framed, which reads as under: “1. Whether this court has not got jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate this matter since there being employed more than 100 workmen in the factory of Party on Second Part?” 13. Some evidence was led by the appellants-Management in terms of which from the year 2001 to 2005, there were 92 workmen employed in the establishment. However, there was categoric admission made in the cross-examination of Kishori Lal Sharma, who appeared as a witness on 434 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. behalf of the workmen, stating that there are more than 100 workmen in the factory but in their Union only 85 of them are members. The Labour Court found that there being less than 100 workmen, the dispute was rightly referred to the Labour Court. Final Award was passed on 10.02.2006. The same was challenged by the appellants-Management before the High Court by fi ling the writ petition7. The argument raised before the High Court was that there was a jurisdictional error in the passed by the Labour Court as the Management had a strength of more than 100 workmen. It was prayed that the writ petition may be disposed of with liberty to the Management to approach the Labour Court for correction of factual error. The writ petition was disposed of vide dated 06.01.2010 with liberty as prayed for. Review Petition8 was fi led by the respondents-workmen against the aforesaid . However, the same was dismissed on 12.03.2010. Thereafter, the matter was taken up before the Labour Court. 14. The appellants-Management fi led an application before the Labour Court bearing I.A. No.1/2010 submitting various documents showing that the Management had employed more than 100 workmen from 1999-2000 till 2009-2010. These were in the form of the documents from Employees State Insurance Corporation, Life Insurance Corporation, Employees Provident Fund Organisation etc. After hearing counsel for both the parties, the Labour Court vide 30.06.2010, admitted the application and permission was granted for annexing the documents. It was noticed in the that in case the appellants-Management employed more than 100 workmen, the Labour Court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issue.
