But given the facts and circumstances of the case and considering that the Appellant is a registered medical practitioner, along with the fact D that the quantity of medicines which have been seized is extremely small, a quantity which can be easily found in the house or a consultation room of a doctor, no offence is made out in the present case. In fact, an exception has been created under Schedule ‘K’ read with Rule 123 to the rules, the appellant ought to have been given the benefit of these provisions and such a E registered medical practitioner should not have been allowed to face a trial where in all likelihood the prosecution would have failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. [Paras 8, 9][922- A-F] 1.2 What the High Court failed to consider, however, is the F provisions contained in Rule 123 read with Schedule ‘K’ to the 1945 Rules and when admittedly it is not the case of the prosecution that the drugs which were seized were being sold in an open shop across the counter. Since this was not being done, and an exception is created under the law in favour of the medical G practitioner where the drugs given in Schedule ‘K’ would be exempted from the purview of Chapter 4 of the Act, prosecution against the Appellant is unwarranted. The sanction for prosecution given in the present case appears, prima facie, to suffer from the vice of non-application of mind. There is no reference to any of the documents, evidence or the submissions H 916 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R.
