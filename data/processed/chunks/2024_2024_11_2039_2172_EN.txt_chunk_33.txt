37. This Court had directed a cash payment of Rs. 150 Crore on or before 31.01.2024 and the SRA had admittedly failed to remit the same. Realizing that this would lead to the initiation of the consequences under the Resolution Plan, Respondent No.1 had applied for an extension before this Court which was declined outright as being misconceived vide dated 02.02.2024. Therefore, the SRA having failed to make the payment and having breached this Court’s dated 18.01.2024, the NCLAT ought to have concluded that the Resolution Plan had failed. 38. In the alternative, the ASG argued that, assuming without admitting that the non-compliance of this Court’s Judgement dated 18.01.2024 would only have the consequence of bringing a closure to the offer made in the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 and not have any effect on the Appeal that was pending before the NCLAT, the NCLAT while passing it’s final dated 12.03.2024 ought to have insisted on the payment of Rs. 150 Crore in cash. That would have been in tune with the specific direction that was issued by this Court & the intent with which the direction was issued, and the SRA having not paid the same, had committed a breach of the Resolution Plan. The NCLAT went to the extent of swapping the conditions laid out in the Resolution Plan by directing the adjustment of the PBG first and the execution of the mortgage on the three Dubai properties later i.e., within 30 days from its dated 12.03.2024. It was submitted that even the extension that was allowed for the execution of mortgage expired on 11.04.2024 and the SRA continues to be a defaulter in this regard as well. 39. The ASG vehemently contended that, there has been a triple breach on the part of SRA – Firstly, breach of the Resolution Plan; secondly, violation of the directions issued by this Court dated 18.01.2024 and; thirdly, the failure to execute the mortgage of the three Dubai properties before 11.04.2024. 40. The ASG submitted that the impugned of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2024 at Para 129, granted 30 days’ time to the SRA for the creation of charge over the Dubai properties and directed the SRA 2092 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports to bear all the necessary expenses. It was submitted that there was complete inaction on the part of the SRA for 29 days from the date of the impugned and on 10.04.2024 at 16:38 hours, the SRA sent an email stating that they are willing to proceed with the security creation of the Dubai properties and also informed that since its value had reduced by Rs. 14 Crore, they would bridge the gap with an additional property or a cash security. On the same date, another email was sent by the SRA at 17:18 hours stating that an account balance of Rs. 76.07 Lakh is available with the Appellants and the same may be used to execute the mortgage. The ASG submitted that the Appellants replied to the said communication on the same day at 19:18 hours stating that: (a) The assenting financial creditors on 13.10.2023 have appointed Mashreq Bank to act as the agent for creation of the mortgage in terms of the prevailing law in Dubai and the necessary amount required to be paid to them had not yet been received.
