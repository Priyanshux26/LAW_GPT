Case Arising From CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave Petition (Civil) Diary No. 56230 of 2024 From the and dated 11.06.2024 of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in IA No. 2748 of 2021 in Review Petition (L) No. 7558 of 2021 Appearances for Parties Randhir Kumar Ojha, Adv. for the Petitioner. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2115 Pandurang Vithal Kevne v. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited & Anr. / of the Supreme Court Rajesh Bindal, J. 1. The present Special Leave Petition has been filed impugning the dated 11.06.2024 vide which the High Court1 was pleased to disallow the petitioner’s Application for condonation of delay2 and rejected the Second Review Petition.3 2. This Special Leave Petition before us is yet another stark example of the blatant misuse and abuse of the judicial process. The petitioner, seemingly blinded by his own sense of grievance, has embarked on a relentless and frivolous litigation spree, dragging this Court and the High Court through multiple meritless review petitions, appeals, and motions, all stemming from his well-reasoned removal from service. This is one of the reasons which results in choking the dockets in courts. 3. Before delving into the specifics of this case, it is imperative to underscore that the right to access the courts is a cornerstone of our democracy. However, this right is not absolute and must be exercised responsibly. When litigants, like the petitioner before us, engage in forum shopping, file repetitive and meritless pleas, and deliberately delay proceedings, they erode the very foundation of our legal system. 4. Now, turning to the facts of this case in brief, as is evident from the material on record, the petitioner was employed as an Examiner with the respondent No. 1 organization since 1977. In December 1997, respondent No. 1 issued him a charge sheet for misconduct due to his frequent and prolonged absence from duty, without prior permission or intimation. Following a departmental inquiry, the petitioner was found guilty and was removed from service w.e.f. 14.07.2000. His statutory appeal was dismissed by the appellate authority. The petitioner then raised an industrial dispute, which was referred to the Central Government Industrial Tribunal (CGIT) at Mumbai. 1 High Court of Bombay, Maharashtra 2 I.A. No. 2748 of 2021 3 R. P. No. 7558 of 2021 2116 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 5. On 22.12.2006, the CGIT passed a final award upholding the petitioner’s removal from service. It ruled that the petitioner’s absences qualified as misconduct as these were “habitual” and without prior permission. Even if respondent No. 1 later regularized his absences, it did not change the fact that he had been absent without permission. The CGIT also noted that he did not seem interested in adhering to rules and regulations or exhibiting devotion to his duty. The respondent No. 1 also got a police investigation done after the domestic enquiry was initiated, which revealed that the petitioner was running a business in the name of his wife, at his native place while being employed under respondent No.
