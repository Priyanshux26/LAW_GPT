Shri Rohtagi placed reliance upon the following three s of this Court in support of his submissions: 1. Shatrughan Chauhan and anr. v Union of India & Ors.3; E 2. V. Sriharan alias Murugan v. Union of India & Ors.4; and 3. Navneet Kaur v. State (NCT of Delhi) and anr.5 9. On the other hand Shri K.M.Natraj, learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that the petitioner having expressed in specific terms F that he has no faith in the judiciary of this country and that he did not regret at all being part of the crime and further has used contemptuous terms before the High Court which have been duly recorded, he does not deserve any mercy in view of his conduct. It is further submitted that till date the petitioner himself has not submitted any Mercy Petition. G The Mercy Petition dated 25.03.2012 attached with the petition is by the SGPC under Article 72 of the Constitution of India. The communication 3 (2014) 3 SCC 1 4 (2014) 4 SCC 242 5 (2014) 7 SCC 264 H 272 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A dated 27.09.2019 by the Ministry of Home Affairs, referred to above, is only a request to the state government to send a proposal for commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment under Article 72 of the Constitution of India. It is submitted that once the petitioner has not filed any Mercy Petition himself, there is no question of granting any relief as claimed. Reliance is placed upon a of the Guwahati High Court in the B case of Kusumbala Tarun Das v. Union of India6. Another objection taken by learned ASG is to the effect that Criminal Appeals filed by the co-accused are still pending before this Court, as such consideration of any Mercy Petition would arise only after disposal of those appeals. Details of three Criminal Appeals filed by two co-accused Lakhwinder C Singh and Jagtar Singh Hawara and also one Criminal Appeal filed by the CBI against the commutation of the sentence of Jagtar Singh Hawara, are as follows: D E 10. According to learned ASG, the decision in these appeals pending before this Court would be a relevant material and while considering the Mercy Petition the same could have a bearing. As such it would be F appropriate to await the decision of the pending appeals. In support of his submission, reliance is placed upon a of this Court in the case of Harbans Singh v. State of U.P.7 11. Shri Natraj, learned ASG further made a submission that there is no delay in consideration of the Mercy Petition. According to Shri G Natraj, it is only after 27.09.2019 that the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, required the state government to send the proposal for commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment under Article 72 6 (2011) SCC Online Gau 370 H 7 (1982) 2 SCC 101 BALWANT SINGH v.
