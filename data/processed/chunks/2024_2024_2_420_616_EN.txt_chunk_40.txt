44. The presumption of constitutionality is based on two premises. First, it is based on democratic accountability, that is, legislators are elected representatives who are aware of the needs of the citizens and are 58 For this purpose, the petitioners referred to the representation-reinforcement model of judicial review propounded by John Hart Ely in his book Democracy and Distrust: A Theory of Judicial Review (Harvard University Press, 2002) and the of this Court in Subash Chandra v. Delhi Subordinate Service Selection Board, [20102 S9CR ]97 8 : (2009) 15 SCC 458 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 479 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. best placed to frame policies to resolve 18717, Second, legislators are privy to information necessary for policy making which the Courts as an adjudicating authority are not. However, the policy underlying the legislation must not violate the freedoms and rights which are entrenched in Part Ill of the Constitution and other constitutional provisions. It is for this reason that previous s of this Court have held that the presumption of constitutionality is rebutted when a prima facie case of violation of a fundamental right is established. The onus then shifts on the State to prove that the violation of the fundamental right is justified. In Dharam Dutt v. Union of India®, a two-Judge Bench of this Court elucidated the principle in the following terms: “49. In spite of there being a general presumption in favour of the constitutionality of the legislation, in a challenge laid to the validity of any legislation allegedly violating any right or freedom guaranteed by clause (1) of Article 19 of the Constitution, on a prima facie case of such violation having been made out, the onus would shift upon the respondent State to show that the legislation comes within the permissible limits of the most relevant out of clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution, and that the restriction is reasonable. The Constitutional Court would expect the State to place before it sufficient material justifying the restriction and its reasonability. On the State succeeding in bringing the restriction within the scope of any of the permissible restrictions, such as, the sovereignty and integrity of India or public , decency or morality etc. the onus of showing that restriction is unreasonable would shift back to the petitioner. Where the restriction on its face appears to be unreasonable, nothing more would be required to substantiate the plea of unreasonability. Thus the onus of proof in such like cases is an ongoing shifting process to be consciously observed by the Court called upon to decide the constitutional validity of a legislation by reference to Article 19 of the Constitution.” 59 See State of Bombay v.
