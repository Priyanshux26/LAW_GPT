But with Nation States gradually moving from laissez faire governance to welfare governance, the role of the State is ever expanding, which justifies the shift. (ix) While the South African Constitution has adopted a horizontal D application by providing in Section 9(4) of the Bill of Rights of Final Constitution of 1996 that no person may unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds in terms of sub-Section (3) which sets out the grounds that bind the State, the judiciary itself has E adopted a direct horizontal effect, in Ireland as could be seen from the decisions in John Meskell vs. Córas Iompair Éireann30 and Murtagh Properties Limited vs. Cleary31. In John Meskell (supra), the Irish Supreme Court granted damages against the employer who dismissed the employee for not joining a particular union after serving a due notice F to persuade him. In Murtagh Properties Limited (supra), the High Court recognized and enforced the right to earn livelihood without any discrimination based on sex against a private employer. Countries like Canada and Germany have developed indirect horizontal application, meaning G thereby that the rights regulate the laws and statutes, which in turn regulate the conduct of citizens; 30 1973 IR 121 31 1972 IR 330 H 622 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A (x) In the Indian context, direct horizontal effect has limited application as can be seen from Articles 15(2), 17 and 24; (xi) Paradigm cases of horizontality should be distinguished from ordinary cases. For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Shelly vs. Kraemer32 a covenant contained in a contract B prohibiting the sale of houses in a neighbourhood to African- Americans, as unenforceable, for they have the effect of denying equal protection under the laws. The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany took a similar view in Lûth33 case (1958) where a call for boycott of a film directed by a person who had worked on anti-semitic Nazi propaganda C was challenged. The German Court held that there was an objective of values that must affect all spheres of law; (xii) It has been repeatedly held by this Court that the power under Article 226 is available not only against the D Government and its instrumentalities but also against “any person or authority”. A reference may be made in this regard to two decisions namely Praga Tools Corporation vs. Shri C.A. Imanual34 and Andi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotasav E Smarak Trust vs.V.R. Rudani35; (xiii) There are several instances where this Court has issued writs under Article 32 against non-State actors. Broadly those cases fall under two categories, namely, (i) private players performing public duties/functions; and (ii) non-State actors performing statutory activities that impact the rights F of citizens. Cases which fall under these two categories have been held by this Court to be amenable to writ jurisdiction as seen from several decisions including M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India36. Absent any of these parameters, the Court has refused to exercise writ G jurisdiction as seen from Binny Ltd. vs. V. Sadasivan.37; 32 334 U.S. 1 (1948) 33 Luth (1958) BVerfGE 7, 198 34 (1969) 1 SCC 585 35 (1989) 2 SCC 691 36 AIR 1987 SC 1086 H 37 (2005) 6 SCC 657 KAUSHAL KISHOR v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS.
