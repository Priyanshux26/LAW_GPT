Such an interpretation would be regressive, anti-divorced Muslim woman and contrary to Articles 14 and 15(1) and (3) as well as Article 39(e) of the Constitution of India. Therefore, inspite of an option of seeking maintenance under the provisions of the 1986 Act, Section 125 of the CrPC is applicable to a divorced Muslim woman. 29. Similarly, the expression “notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this Act or any other law for the time being in force” in sub-section (1) of Section 4, is indicative of the fact that the Magistrate can for maintenance of a divorced Muslim woman being entitled to maintenance as per the provisions of the said Act. Further, sub-section (1) of Section 4 takes into consideration the period after the iddat period while sub-section (1) of Section 3 deals with a period which is within the iddat period. This Section is akin to Section 125 of the CrPC for a reasonable and fair provision of maintenance to be made. 30. In my view, the rights created under the provisions of the 1986 Act are in addition to and not in derogation of the right created under Section 125 of the CrPC, and the same is the basis for this Court’s conclusion in Danial Latifi to save the 1986 Act from the vice of unconstitutionality. This is because nowhere in the of this Court in the aforesaid case is there a reference to any bar under the provisions of the 1986 Act and neither has this Court created any such bar in the aforesaid for a divorced Muslim woman to approach the Court under Section 125 of the CrPC for maintenance. Thus, the non-obstante clause in Sub-section (1) of Section 3 cannot result in Sections 3 and 4 of the 1986 Act whittling down the application of Section 125 of the CrPC and other allied provisions of the CrPC to a divorced Muslim woman. Therefore, if a divorced Muslim woman approaches the Magistrate for enforcement of her rights under Section 125 of the CrPC, she cannot be turned away to seek relief only under Sections 3 and 4 of the 1986 Act as is sought to be contended by the appellant herein. In other words, such a divorced Muslim woman is entitled to seek recourse to either or both [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1297 Mohd. Abdul Samad v. The State of Telangana & Anr. the provisions. The option lies with such a woman. The Court would have to ultimately balance between the amount awarded under the 1986 Act and the one to be awarded under Section 125 of the CrPC. 31. In this context, I note that the learned senior counsel for the appellant, Sri Qadri relied upon the language of Sections 5 and 7 of the 1986 Act to argue that the Parliament intended to give the 1986 Act an overriding effect over the secular law on maintenance, i.e. Sections 125 to 128 of the CrPC. Sections 5 and 7 are reproduced for immediate reference: “5.
