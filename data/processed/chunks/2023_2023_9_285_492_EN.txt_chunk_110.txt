16.6. The learned Amicus Curiae points out that a Court exercising G power under Section 11(6A) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 is not a 10 Law Commission of India, ‘Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996’ (246th Report, August 2014) Available at (https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/ s3ca0daec69b5adc880fb464895726dbdf/uploads/2022/08/2022081615.pdf) <Last accessed on 19.3.2023> H 432 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A Court as defined in Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 which has the authority to ‘receive evidence’. In some sense, under Section 11(6A), the Court is to only form a prime facie opinion. 16.7. Significantly, the parties are not under an obligation to file an original arbitration agreement and only the copy can be annexed which B however is not an “instrument” as provided in Section 2(14) of the Stamp Act, 1899. The reading of Section 33 or 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899 would pointedly suggest that these provisions are not concerned with the copy of the instrument. Validity is always open to examination at the post-referral stage. [Jupudi Kesava Rao v Pulavarthi Venkata Subbarao and others11, Hariom Agrawal v Prakash Chand C Malviya12] 17. Projecting the contrary view, Mr. Gagan Sanghi, learned Counsel for the appellant makes the following submissions: 17.1. Section 35 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 bars admission D of unduly stamped “instrument” in evidence “for any purpose” and also “acting upon it”. In Govt. of AP. v P. Laxmi Devi13, it was held that “shall” in Section 33 of Stamp Act, 1899 is mandatory and unstamped document must be impounded. 17.2. Even assuming that stamp duty is not payable on an arbitration E agreement under Stamp Act, 1899, when arbitration agreement is contained as a clause in an instrument on which stamp duty is payable, such arbitration agreement as an instrument, attracts the bar of Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899. 17.3. The learned counsel argues that separation of agreement F from the substantive contract is a legal fiction created by Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. Section 16 of Arbitration Act, 1996 cannot be an exception to Section 35 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.

N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 433 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] 17.4. According to Mr. Sanghi, Doctrine of Separability and A Kompetenz Kompetenz has no bearing on the issue of enforceability of an arbitration agreement when proper stamp duty is not paid on the instrument containing the arbitration agreement. The learned counsel relied on the decision of UK Supreme Court in Enka Insaat v OOO Insurance Company17 where it was held that an “arbitration clause B is nonetheless part of bundle of rights and obligations recorded in the contractual document”.
