which was permissible for in-service candidates as per Rule 16 of the Orissa Education (Recruitment and Conditions of Service of Teachers and Members of the Staff of Aided Educational Institutions) Rules, 1974. In this connection, reliance was placed by learned counsel on the decision in Bibekananda Das v State of Orissa, 1997 (II) OLR 122, holding that a teacher appointed prior to 18.12.1993, without having the training/qualifi cation for the post, cannot be terminated or denied approval, but such employee was to be allowed to undergo training in course of his employment and on completion of the training, he/she would become entitled to trained scale of pay. Thus, it was submitted that Respondent No.5’s appointment cannot be said to be illegal for lack of training/qualifi cation at the time of appointment and moreover, it was submitted that in the counter-affi davit fi led on behalf of the Board of Secondary Education, Orissa, it has been stated that both the appellant and the Respondent No.5 were untrained at the time of their respective appointments and thus, no benefi t on this score can accrue to the appellant. Even apropos the stand of the appellant and the Inspector of Schools showing that Respondent No.5 was continuing in service from 04.01.1995 to 18.08.2002 in the Sri Thakur Nigamananda High School, Terundia, it was contended that the same is false and fabricated as the said school obtained permission only in 2000 and recognition was granted in 2002. On this issue, it was submitted that at best, even if the Respondent No.5 was appointed in some other school, still his appointment in the present school would not be nullifi ed, as there can be, possibly, a charge of misconduct, for which proceedings can be or could have been initiated, but no such proceedings have in fact been initiated. Insofar as the stand taken by the appellant that he has continuity on the post is concerned, learned counsel submitted that continuing in service for a long period would not make an ab initio invalid appointment valid. BICHITRANANDA BEHERA v. STATE OF ORISSA AND 411 OTHERS [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION: 14. Having considered the matter, the Court fi nds that in the face of competing submissions and rival claims of the appellant and the Respondent No.5, a balanced view is to be taken of the events which have actually taken place, keeping in mind the law. 15. On the factual scenario, the appellant was appointed by the Managing Committee constituted on 15.12.1992 and given appointment on 14.05.1994 during the time when a stay granted by the High Court in favour of the Managing Committee constituted on 15.12.1992 was continuing i.e., since 11.01.1993. Thus, the appointment made by the said Managing Committee (constituted on 15.12.1992) of the appellant cannot be labelled illegal per se nor termed void ab initio. From the record it also transpires that the then incumbent, namely Kapil Sasmal, who was appointed as PET in the School, continued till 15.10.1993, when he was terminated by the Managing Committee for absence vide resolution No.39 dated 15.10.1993.
