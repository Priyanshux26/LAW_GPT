Subsequently in the of this Court in the case of Supertech Limited-vs- Emerald Court Owner Resident Welfare Association & Others [(2023) 10 SCC 817], a two-Judge Bench of this Court examined the maintainability of miscellaneous applications “for clarification, modification or recall” and was pleased to observe the following in the context of that case:- “12. The attempt in the present miscellaneous application is clearly to seek a substantive modification of the of this Court. Such an attempt is not permissible in a miscellaneous application. While Mr Mukul Rohatgi, learned 1038 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Senior Counsel has relied upon the provisions of LV Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013, what is contemplated therein is a saving of the inherent powers of the Court to make such s as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court. LV Rule 6 cannot be inverted to bypass the provisions for review in XLVII of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013. The miscellaneous application is an abuse of the process.” The authorities which were cited in the said by the Coordinate Bench are the cases of State (UT of Delhi) -vs- Gurdip Singh Uban and Others [(2000) 7 SCC 296], Sone Lal and Others -vs- State of Uttar Pradesh [(1982) 2 SCC 398], Ram Chandra Singh -vs- Savitri Devi and Others [(2004 12 SCC 713], Common Cause -vs- Union of India and Others [(2004) 5 SCC 222], Zahira Habibullah Sheikh and Another -vs- State of Gujarat and Others [(2004) 5 SCC 353], P.N. Eswara Iyer and Others -vs- Registrar, Supreme Court of India [(1980) 4 SCC 680], Suthendraraja alias Suthenthira Raja alias Santhan and Others -vs- State through DSP/CBI, SIT, Chennai [(1999) 9 SCC 323], Ramdeo Chauhan alias Raj Nath -vs- State of Assam [(2001) 5 SCC 714], Devendra Pal Singh -vs- State (NCT of Delhi) and Another [(2003) 2 SCC 501] and Rashid Khan Pathan in re, [(2021) 12 SCC 64]. These authorities broadly stipulate that multiple attempts to reopen a of this Court should not be permitted. Hence, we do not consider it necessary to deal with these authorities individually. 13. Rule 6 of LV of the 2013 Rules stipulates: - “6. Nothing in these rules shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent powers of the Court to make such s as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court.” The maintainability of the present application cannot be explained by invoking the inherent power of this Court either. The applicant has not applied for review of the main . In the contempt action, it failed to establish any willful disobedience of the main and on account of non-payment of LPS. Now the applicant cannot continue to hitchhike on the same by relying on the inherent power or jurisdiction of this Court. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1039 Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v.
