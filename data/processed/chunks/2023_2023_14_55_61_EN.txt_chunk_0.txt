[2023] 14 S.C.R. 55 : 2023 INSC 955 CASE DETAILS BHISHAM LAL VERMA v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH AND ANOTHER (Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 7976 of 2023) OCTOBER 30, 2023 [C.T. RAVIKUMAR AND SANJAY KUMAR, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration : Is a second petition maintainable u/s. 482 Cr.P.C. on grounds that were available for challenge even at the time of fi ling of the fi rst petition thereunder. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 482 – A complaint case was registered u/ss. 409, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120B of IPC r/w. ss. 7 and 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – Petitioner was amongst the accused named therein – The State Government accorded sanction to prosecute the petitioner – Upon completion of investigation, charge- sheet was prepared and cognizance was taken – In 2018, Petitioner fi led petition u/s. 482 Cr.P.C. and challenged only Government’s sanction and same was disposed of with liberty to approach Trial Court – In 2022, the petitioner again fi led petition u/s. 482 Cr.P.C. with prayers to quash charge-sheet and the cognizance – Propriety: Held: Though it is clear that there can be no blanket rule that a second petition u/s. 482 Cr.P.C. would not lie in any situation and it would depend upon the facts and circumstances of the individual case, it is not open to a person aggrieved to raise one plea after the other, by invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court u/s. 482 Cr.P.C., though all such pleas were very much available even at the fi rst instance – Permitting the fi ling of successive petitions u/s. 482 Cr.P.C. ignoring this principle would enable an ingenious accused to eff ectively stall the proceedings against him to suit his own interest and convenience, by fi ling one petition after another u/s. 482 56 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. Cr.P.C., irrespective of when the cause therefor arose – Such abuse of process cannot be permitted – In the instant case, the fi ling of the charge sheet and the cognizance thereof by the Court concerned were well before the fi ling of the fi rst petition u/s. 482 Cr.P.C., wherein challenge was made only to the sanction – That being so, the petitioner was not at liberty to again invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to the charge sheet and the cognizance at a later point of time.
