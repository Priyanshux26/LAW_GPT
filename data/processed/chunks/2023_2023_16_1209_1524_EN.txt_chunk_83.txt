This Court held in the affi rmative and traced the right to Article 21 and the Preamble of the Constitution. Jeevan Reddy, J. writing for the majority observed that education is of transcendental importance in the life of an individual without which the objectives set forth in the Preamble cannot be achieved. It was further emphasised that the Constitution expressly refers to education in Articles 41, 45, and 46 of 141 State of Kerala v. NM Thomas, 1976 SCR (1) 906 142 Olega Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation, 1985 SCC (3) 545 143 Hussainara Khatoon v. Home Secretary, (1980) 1 SCC81 144 Unnikrishnan v. State of AP, (1993) 1 SCC 645 145 Also see Mohd. Hanif Qureshi v. State of AP, 1959 SCR 629 146 (1993) 1 SCC 645 SUPRIYO @ SUPRIYA CHAKRABORTY & ANR. v. UNION 1327 OF INDIA [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] the Constitution which indicates the importance conferred to it. However, this Court limited the scope of the right to education in view of Article 45 which states that the State shall endeavour to provide free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years. Thus, this Court held that the Constitution guarantees a right to free education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years. 156. In the second facet, the Courts read fundamental rights to include both negative and positive postulates independent of the Directive Principles of State policy. YV Chandrachud, C.J. writing the opinion for the majority in Minerva Mills v. Union of India,147 observed that fundamental rights deal with both negative and positive postulates. In Indibily Creative Private limited v. Government of West Bengal148, one of us (DY Chandrachud, J. as he then was) observed that Article 19 imposes a negative restraint on the State to not interfere with the freedoms of all citizens and a duty on the State to ensure that conditions for the free and unrestrained exercise of the freedom are created. In Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) (supra), a nine-Judge Bench of this Court held that the Constitution guarantees the right to privacy. This Court expressly held that the right to privacy includes both negative and positive postulates. The negative postulate consists of the right to be left alone and the positive postulate places a duty on the State to adopt measures for protecting and safeguarding individual privacy.149 157. The second facet on the scope of fundamental rights is now cemented in Indian constitutional jurisprudence. Fundamental rights consist of both negative and positive postulates preventing the State from interfering with the rights of the citizens and creating conditions for the exercise of such rights respectively. This understanding of fundamental rights is unique to Indian constitutional jurisprudence. Fundamental rights have been construed in this wide manner by Indian Courts because of the constitutional conception of the role of the State. Viewing fundamental rights purely as negative rights runs the risk of undermining the role of the State. 158. Fundamental rights are not merely a restraint on the power of the State but provisions which promote and safeguard the interests of the 147 AIR 1980 C 1789 148 (2020) 12 SCC 436 149 Plurality opinion authored by Justice DY Chandrachud (paragraph 158) 132 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R.
