19. For the above reasons, it is held that exclusion of the petitioner and other like candidates, on the ground of their securing less than 75% in the qualifying examination, was unwarranted and discriminatory. The reference to, and incorporation of clauses giving eff ect to such criterion is held unenforceable and void. This court is alive to the fact that allocation for admission to all but one seat has been completed. By this court’s interim , dated 08.08.2023, the respondent was restrained from fi lling the left- over seat(s) which had to be fi lled after the last round (of admission process) scheduled on 10.08.2023. In view of the fi ndings, it is hereby directed that the remaining seat or seats shall be fi lled by application of the standards spelt out in the sports policy of the UT of Chandigarh, as applied by the respondent university to determine inter se sports merit of the candidates who had applied, but whose candidature was rejected on the ground of ineligibility due to their securing less than 75% marks in the qualifying examination. These candidates however should have qualifi ed in terms of the immediately preceding academic year’s criterion, applicable for the balance sports quota seat(s). At the same time, candidates who have been selected and given admission are concerned, shall not be disturbed. The process of fi lling the remaining vacant seat(s)- in the sports quota shall be completed within two weeks. Nothing said in this shall result in invalidation of admission of candidates in other (non-sports) categories. 20. The impugned is, resultantly, set aside. The appeal is allowed in the above terms. In the circumstances, there shall be no on costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Ankit Gyan
