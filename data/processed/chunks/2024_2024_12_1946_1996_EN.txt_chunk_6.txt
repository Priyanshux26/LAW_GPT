[2024] 12 S.C.R. 1955 Bijoy Kumar Moni v. Paresh Manna & Anr. A. FACTUAL MATRIX 5. The facts giving rise to this appeal may be summarised as under: a. The case of the complainant is plain and simple. According to him, for the purpose of operating his trade loan account, he would frequently visit the U.B.I. Raghunathpur Branch and it is during one such visit sometime in the month of January, 2006 that he came to be introduced to the accused by one Ashoke Mondal who was the Manager of the said branch. Thereafter, the accused maintained amicable relations with the complainant through telephonic conversations. b. In February 2006, the accused was in need of some financial assistance and in such circumstances, he approached the complainant with a request that a particular amount may be lent to him with a promise to repay on demand. c. Accordingly, the complainant issued a bearer cheque for an amount of Rs.7,00,000/- (Rupees Seven Lakh only) which indisputably was encashed by the accused. d. Upon the complainant requesting the accused to repay the amount referred to above, he issued a cheque dated 28.04.2006 drawn on the Standard Chartered Bank, N.S. Road, Kolkata for the amount of Rs.8,45,000/- (Rupees Eight lakh forty five thousand only). It is the case of the complainant that Rs. 7,00,000/- was lent by him by way of a bearer cheque and Rs. 1,45,000/- was subsequently lent in cash. That is how the accused issued a cheque of Rs. 8,45,000/- for the purpose of discharging his debt towards the complainant. e. However, the said cheque was signed by him in his capacity as a Director of Shilabati Hospital Pvt. Ltd. and was drawn upon the bank account maintained in the name of the hospital. f. There is a stamp of Shilabati Hospital Pvt. Ltd. on the cheque and beneath the signature of the accused there is a stamp of the Director. g. It is not in dispute that the cheque in question came to be dishonoured for want of sufficient funds. 1956 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports h. In such circumstances, the complainant issued a statutory notice to the accused under Section 138 of the NI Act dated 14.08.2006 calling upon him to make the payment within 15 days of the receipt of the notice.
