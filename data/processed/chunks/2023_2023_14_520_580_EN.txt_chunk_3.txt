Under the registered sale deed dated 2.3.1970, two and a half bigha land was fi rst purchased and under the second registered sale deed dated 16.3.1970, another half bigha land was purchased from one Lal Khan. The plaintiff and the defendant nos. 2 to 4 thereby became joint khatedars of the said three bighas of purchased land. While the purchasers were in peaceful possession of the land bearing Khasra no.211/81 and 239/83, the defendant no.1 i.e. the Urban Improvement Trust, Bikaner started making claim over this land projecting that they had acquired the said land. Initially, the suit was fi led seeking permanent injunction to restrain the defendant no.1 from trespassing into the land and initiating any acquisition process but later when the defendant no.1 was trying to obtain forceful possession of the land during the pendency of the suit, the plaintiff amended the suit on 11.11.2002 to secure restoration of possession through mandatory injunction. It was also pleaded that on the basis of a dated 26.2.1998(WP 2243/95) in Bhanwarlal v State of Rajasthan, concerning some other land, the defendant no. 1 had taken possession of the plaintiff ’s land and that the plaintiff was enjoying possession till 9.6.1998 during the pendency of civil suit.

GORDHAN 525 DASS (D) THROUGH LRS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] of land through 2 sale deeds dated 2.3.1970 and 16.3.1970, and those sale deeds are registered in the offi ce of Sub-Registrar, Bikaner. The defendant no.1 also admitted that the plaintiff submitted an application before District Magistrate to convert one bigha land to non-agricultural category on which the District Magistrate issued NOC since the said land was needed to set up a petrol pump. Projecting their right over the concerned land, the defendant no.1 in the written statement claimed that they had acquired 24 Bigha 12 Biswa land comprising Khasra No.294/82 and requisite compensation was paid to the original khatedar. Therefore, no compensation is payable to either the plaintiff or the defendant nos.2 to 4 who had purchased the 3 Bigha land. 3. The Trial Court on the basis of the rival contentions framed the following issues: “(i) Whether properties mentioned in paras 1, 1 (a), 1 (b) of the plaint are under the ownership of plaintiff and defendant no.2 to 4? (ii) Whether out of the above-stated lands, two bigha land has been wrongly acquired by the defendant no.1? (iii) Whether defendant no.1 has wrongly got possession over suit land according to para no.9 of the plaint, plaintiff is entitled to get the same restored? (iv) Whether compensation has already been paid to the concerning people having acquired 24 Bigha 12 Biswa suit land comprising Khasra No.294/83 adopting lawful process according to para No.115 of written statement? (v) Relief (s) ?” 4.
