Digital Supreme Court Reports Council; for them there is no binding to secure minimum percentage in graduation level or equivalent examination.

The appellant applied for the post of Teacher under the said advertisement. It is undisputed that the appellant had 44.58% marks in his graduation. It is also undisputed that the appellant secured admission in the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) course on 23.10.2009 i.e. the date on which he deposited the fee. This fact is admitted in the counter affidavit of the State filed before this Court in Para 7 and in the written submissions filed by the State in Para 1. The appellant, being admittedly from the reserved category, the qualifying percentage required for admission to the B.Ed Course was 40% marks in graduation (45% for general category) as is clear from the 12.04.2019 Press Release. The appellant fulfilled this criteria and obtained admission. 6. When the matter stood thus, the appellant’s name did not appear in the provisional list of selected candidates despite securing 44.58% marks, which was way above the cut-off marks. The appellant contends that he was informed that his candidature was rejected for the reason that he had secured less than 45% marks in his graduation. 7. Being aggrieved, the appellant filed S.B. Civil Writ No. 16005 of 2018 and one Rakesh Gaur, who was similarly situated, also filed S.B. Civil Writ No. 14129 of 2018 [Rakesh Gaur vs. The State of Rajasthan]. Both the writ petitions were dismissed on 27.11.2018. Undeterred, the appellant filed D.B. Spl. Appl. Writ No. 997 of 2019. Rakesh Gaur filed D.B. Spl. Appl. Writ No. 224 of 2019. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 223 Manilal v. The State of Rajasthan & Ors. 8.
