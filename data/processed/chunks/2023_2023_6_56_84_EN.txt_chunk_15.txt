(xii) In a Departmental note put up on 28.12.1995, it was mentioned B clearly that the Recreation Ground was developed by appellant No.1 as per the approval of Superintendent of Gardens. (xiii) On 02.01.1996, a DRC (Development Rights Certificate) was issued to appellant No.1, with respect to the surrendered land. (xiv) It is only thereafter that appellant No.2 who is a partner of C Mayfair Housing jumped into the fray and sought permission to maintain the Recreation Ground, through a letter dated 20.11.1996. On the said letter dated 20.11.1996, there is an endorsement of the Joint Municipal Commissioner made on 26.11.1996 that the plot had come to BMC under TDR and that, “he had spent Rs.1.25 crores on this RG and developed it”. D (xv) On the said letter dated 20.11.1996 of Mayfair Housing, a note was passed by the Deputy Municipal Commissioner stating that there was no clarity about the nature of the activities to be carried out by Mayfair and that the same needed to be part of an agreement. E (xvi) Thereafter appellant No.1 executed two deeds of power of attorney, both dated 24.12.1996 in favour of appellant No.2 and his wife. By one power of attorney, appellant No.1 authorised their duly constituted attorneys to deal with the TDR already granted to them under the Development Rights Certificate issued on 02.01.1996. By the other deed of power of attorney, appellant No.1 authorized their duly constituted F attorneys to seek the grant of “Amenity TDR” also known as Additional TDR. Interestingly, this deed authorized appellant No.2 and his wife to apply for getting permission from the authorized department for the construction of Recreation Ground in accordance with the plans/specifications. G (xvii) It is important to note that both the deeds of power of attorney were executed by appellant No.1 on 24.12.1996, after appellant No.2 representing Mayfair Housing made a representation on 20.11.1996 seeking permission for the development of Recreation Ground.

(xix) Thereafter, a communication was issued to Mayfair Housing, B with reference to the letter of appellant No.2 dated 20.11.1996, informing them that the development and maintenance of the Recreation Ground on payment of nominal fee has been sanctioned, subject to certain conditions, one of which was that no TDR will be given. (xx) All the above correspondence culminated in the letter of C request dated 17.04.1998 issued by appellant No.2 on behalf of appellant No.1 for the grant of additional TDR. 39. The entire correspondence that began with a letter dated 14.07.1994 sent by Worthy Enterprises, the Architects of appellant No.1 to the Chief Engineer (DP) of the Municipal Corporation and culminating D in the letter of appellant No.2 dated 17.04.1998 seeking the grant of additional TDR, can be split into two time zones.
