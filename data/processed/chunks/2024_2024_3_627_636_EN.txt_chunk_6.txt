Digital Supreme Court Reports 22. The above-referred facts speak for themselves, and that is the reason why the Tribunal has come to a conclusion that the denial of regularization of the 13 workmen is wholly unjustified. As stated previously, we do not find any grounds in the artificial distinction asserted by the appellant. However, as the case was argued at length we thought it appropriate to give reasons for rejecting the appeals. What we have referred to hereinabove are all findings of fact by the Tribunal as affirmed by the High Court. In view of the concurrent findings of fact on the issue of nature of work, the continuing nature of work, continuous working of the workmen, we are of the opinion that there is no merit in the appeals filed by the appellant. 23. This is a case of wrongful denial of employment and regularization, for no fault of the workmen and therefore, there will be no restricting their wages. 24. With respect to payment of backwages, we are of the opinion that the workmen will be entitled to backwages as observed by the Industrial Tribunal. However, taking into account, the long-drawn litigation affecting the workmen as well as the appellant in equal measure and taking into account the public interest, we confine the backwages to be calculated from the decision of the Tribunal dated 23.05.2002. This is the only modification in the of the Tribunal, and as was affirmed by the of the High Court. 25. For the reasons stated above, the appeals arising out of the final and of the High Court in W.P. (C) No. 2002/2002 and in Review Petition No. 77/2017 are dismissed with the direction that the concerned workmen shall be entitled to backwages with effect from 23.05.2002. There shall be no as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Result of the case: Aishani Narain, Hony. Associate Editor Appeals dismissed (Verified by: Madhavi Divan, Sr. Advocate) with directions
