20(1): Held: Person cannot be punished for an offence which was not an offence at the time it was committed, nor can he be subjected to a sentence which is greater than the sentence which was applicable at the relevant point of time – Art. 20 (1) does not prohibit this Court, to award a lesser punishment in a befitting case, when this Court is of the opinion that a lesser punishment may be awarded since the new law on the penal provision provides a lesser punishment i.e. lesser than what was actually applicable at the relevant time – Prohibition contained in Art. 20 is on subjecting a person to a higher punishment than which was applicable for that crime at the time of the commission of the crime – There is no prohibition, for this Court to impose a lesser punishment which is now applicable for the same crime.
