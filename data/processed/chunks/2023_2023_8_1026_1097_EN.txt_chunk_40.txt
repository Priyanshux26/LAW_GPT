vs. Indian Young Lawyers Association22, Asgar Ali vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir23 and Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community vs. State of Maharashtra24. 82. Contending that when the very initiation of proceedings by the D ED was without the existence of jurisdictional facts, all subsequent actions, like a pack of cards should fall, the learned senior counsel relies upon the latin maxim sublato fundamento cadit opus meaning that “if initial action is not in consonance with law, all subsequent and consequential proceedings fall through”. In support of this contention, E the learned senior counsel has relied upon the following decisions: (i) Badrinath vs. Government of Tamil Nadu25; (ii) State of Kerala vs. Puthenkavu N.S.S. Karayogam26;and (iii) State of Punjab vs. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar27. 83. Shri C.A. Sundaram, learned senior counsel appearing for one of the accused, adopted a different line of argument. Instead of F attacking the correctness of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary, the learned senior counsel contended:- 18 2022 SCC Online Del 514 19 Crl. Appeal No.1254/2022 dt.16.08.2022 20 SLP (C) No.13103 of 2019 G 21 WP (C) No.366/2022 dated 12.05.2022 22 (2020) 9 SCC 121 23 2022 SCC Online SC 3095 24 2023 SCC Online SC 129 25 (2000) 8 SCC 395 26 (2001) 10 SCC 191 27 (2011) 14 SCC 770 H 1078 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A (i) that the object of PMLA is to prevent money-laundering; (ii) that to constitute an offence of money-laundering, a person should have involved himself in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime; (iii) that ED can assume jurisdiction only after identification of the B proceeds of crime; (iv) that the mandate of ED does not extend to the prosecution of any one for offences other than money-laundering; (v) that this is why Section 66(2) obliges the Director to share the information available with him with other authorities, whenever such C information discloses the contravention of the provisions of any other law; (vi) that without the identification of a property which represents the proceeds of crime, a jurisdictional fact for the initiation of proceedings does not get triggered; D (vii) that no summons can be issued under Section 50 without registering an information report; (viii) that the power to issue summons under Section 50(2) can be exercised only during the course of any investigation or proceeding under E the Act; (ix) that in the case on hand, no property representing the proceeds of crime has been identified; (x) that this is why the High Court questioned the ED as to how Section 3 got invoked; and F (xi) that therefore the initiation of proceedings by the ED cannot be sustained even within the contours of law interpreted in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary. 84. Lastly, it is contended by Shri C.A. Sundaram, learned senior counsel for one of the accused that though the High Court allowed the G prayer of the accused for reasons other than those argued now, the party successful before High Court can always seek to sustain the , on grounds other than those stated in the impugned .
