54. The scenario that emerges is that there was a legal regime operating, which continued to have force since there was no repeal of the notification of 01.03.2002 or the supersession of the Mega Power Policy document of 07.08.2006 on 01.10.2009. The press release clearly mentioned as to what was envisaged and the conditions that were to be replaced and removed. 55. In our considered opinion, the press release did not alter/amend/ repeal the existing law as on 01.10.2009. It was at best the announcement of a proposal approved by the Cabinet which had to be given shape after fulfilment of the conditions mentioned therein. Some of the conditions were that the power purchasing States were to undertake to carry out distribution reforms as laid down by the Ministry of Power and admittedly in that regard there was a meeting held on 28.10.2009; an undertaking was sought from the States in the prescribed formats and the four distribution reform measures 482 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports required to be undertaken were part of the undertaking. Those four measures are (a) timely release of subsidy as per Section 65 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (b) Ensure that discoms will approach SERC for approval of annual revenue requirement/tariff determination in time according to SERC regulations (c) Setting up of Special Courts as provided in the Electricity Act, 2003 to tackle the related cases and (d) ring fencing of SLDCs. 56. It was thereafter on 11.12.2009 in due compliance with the provisions of Section 25 of the Customs Act that the amendment notifications were issued which expressly specified the condition that the power purchasing States ought to have undertaken to carryout distribution reforms as laid out by the Ministry of Power. It is only with the promulgation of the 11.12.2009 notification that entry 400 of the 01.03.2002 notification issued earlier in 2002 was substituted to cover goods required for setting up of any Mega Power Project (as now defined and set out in the notification of 11.12.2009 and elaborated in the policy document of 14.12.2009) did the ‘change in law’ happen. 57. Could the appellant has assumed that the Press Release of 01.10.2009 ordained a new legal regime? We think not and we hold accordingly. The press release is a summary of the Cabinet decision. Even the press release makes it clear that it was a proposal that was envisaged and which was to come into force in future. 58. Certainty is the hallmark of law. It is one of its essential attributes. It is an integral component of the rule of law. What was certain on 01.10.2009 in the context of our case was only the prevalent customs notification of 01.03.2002 issued under section 25, duly notified and gazetted as well as the Mega Power Policy document admittedly promulgated on 07.08.2006. 59. The press release summarizing the Cabinet decision and beset with several conditions created no vested rights on any party to the power purchase agreement vis-a-vis the other party on 01.10.2009.
