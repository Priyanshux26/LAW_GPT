12.1. However, it is not evident from records, as to how the appellant was issued with a Scheduled caste community certificate earlier. But for the requirement under the Declaration in Sl. No 2 in the application for the post of UDC, the denova enquiry would not have happened. It is settled law that an illegality cannot be perpetuated. In this regard, it will be useful to refer to the following s of this Court, wherein it was held that the State was well within its power to take appropriate action, when it comes to its knowledge that a certificate was obtained by fraud. 1518 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (i) State of Maharashtra v. Ravi Prakash Babulalsing Parmar13 “23. The makers of the Constitution laid emphasis on equality amongst citizens. The Constitution of India provides for protective discrimination and reservation so as to enable the disadvantaged group to come on the same platform as that of the forward community. If and when a person takes an undue advantage of the said beneficent provision of the Constitution by obtaining the benefits of reservation and other benefits provided under the Presidential although he is not entitled thereto, he not only plays a fraud on the society but in effect and substance plays a fraud on the Constitution. When, therefore, a certificate is granted to a person who is not otherwise entitled thereto, it is entirely incorrect to contend that the State shall be helpless spectator in the matter.” (ii) Food Corporation of India v. Jagdish Balaram Bahira14 “56. Service under the Union and the States, or for that matter under the instrumentalities of the State subserves a public purpose. These services are instruments of governance. Where the State embarks upon public employment, it is under the mandate of Articles 14 and 16 to follow the principle of equal opportunity. Affirmative action in our Constitution is part of the quest for substantive equality. Available resources and the opportunities provided in the form of public employment are in contemporary times short of demands and needs. Hence, the procedure for selection, and the prescription of eligibility criteria has a significant public element in enabling the State to make a choice amongst competing claims. The selection of ineligible persons is a manifestation of a systemic failure and has a deleterious effect on 13 [2006] Supp. 8 SCR 105 : (2007) 1 SCC 80 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 5 : 2006 SCC OnLine SC 1130 14 [2017] 11 SCR 271 : (2017) 8 SCC 670 : (2017) 2 SCC (L&S) 708 : 2017 SCC OnLine SC 715 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1519 C. Selvarani v. The Special Secretary-Cum-District Collector and Others good governance. Firstly, selection of a person who is not eligible allows someone who is ineligible to gain access to scarce public resources. Secondly, the rights of eligible persons are violated since a person who is not eligible for the post is selected. Thirdly, an illegality is perpetrated by bestowing benefits upon an imposter undeservingly.
