The conduct of the appellants by not including respondent no. 1 in the merit list is not in consonance with the said advertisement. 18. The merit list was prepared in terms of Rule 5, read with Rule 11 of Rules 2014, which has been presented at the beginning of the . Rules 5 and 11 deal with the process of Recruitment, appointment, recruitment procedure, and Residual matters. Nowhere in such rules there is mention of any minimum qualifying marks required out of a total of 100 marks. 978 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 19. The appellants have argued that doubts and ambiguities in Rules 2014 can be successfully cleared using an Executive without tinkering with the original Rule. In the present case, the Executive is dated 16.07.2007 which is much earlier to the Rules which are of 2014. Therefore, the Executive of 2007 is in no way clarificatory or explanatory with respect to the Rules of 2014. The Division Bench rightly discarded the applicability of the Executive dated 16.07.2007. The only criteria for minimum qualifying marks have been mentioned in the Rules 2014 and the advertisement, which states that 32 % for women is the minimum qualifying marks for the written test (70 marks) and not out of 100 marks as interpreted by the appellants. 20. The in the case of Employees’ State Insurance Corporation vs. Union of India & Ors.,2 relied upon on behalf of the appellants has no application in the facts of the present case. In the above one of the issues was whether the executive decision will prevail or the statutory regulations. This Court, relying upon the settled law, held that the statutory regulations will prevail. In the present case the view taken by the High Court is also giving primacy to the Rules 2014 as compared to an earlier executive decision dated 16.07.2007. In fact the above helps respondent no. 1. 21. Respondent no. 1 received 22.5 marks out of 70, 32.14 per cent, above the minimum qualifying marks of 32 per cent as per the advertisement. Therefore, the appellants were not right by denying her a place on the merit list. Impugned judgement does not warrant any interference. 22. Accordingly, these appeals are dismissed. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan 2 [2022] 1 SCR 373 : (2022) 11 SCC 392
