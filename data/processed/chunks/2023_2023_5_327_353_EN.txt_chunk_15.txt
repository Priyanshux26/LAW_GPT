As on 1-1-2016, the 2015 Amendment Act was gazetted and according to Section 1(2) of the 2015 Amendment Act, it H M/S. SHREE VISHNU CONSTRUCTIONS v. THE ENGINEER IN 347 CHIEF MILITARY ENGINEERING SERVICE [M. R. SHAH, J.] was deemed to have come into force on 23-10-2015. Section A 21 of the 1996 Act clearly envisages that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a dispute shall commence from the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent and the plain reading of Section 26 of the 2015 B Amendment Act is self-explicit, leaves no room for interpretation. Sections 21 and 26 of the 1996 Act/the 2015 Amendment Act relevant for the purpose are extracted hereunder: “21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings.—Unless C otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent. *** D 26. Act not to apply to pending arbitral proceedings.— Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act, before the commencement of this Act unless the parties otherwise agree but this Act E shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of this Act.” 26. The conjoint reading of Section 21 read with Section 26 leaves no manner of doubt that the provisions of the 2015 Amendment Act shall not apply to such of the arbitral proceedings which have commenced in terms of the provisions F of Section 21 of the principal Act unless the parties otherwise agree. The effect of Section 21 read with Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act has been examined by this Court in Aravali Power Co. (P) Ltd. v. Era Infra Engg. Ltd. [Aravali Power Co. (P) Ltd. v. Era Infra Engg. Ltd., (2017) 15 SCC G 32 : (2018) 2 SCC (Civ) 642] and taking note of Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act laid down the broad principles as under : (SCC p. 53, para 22) “22. The principles which emerge from the decisions referred to above are: H 348 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 22.1. In cases governed by the 1996 Act as it stood before the Amendment Act came into force: 22.1.1. The fact that the named arbitrator is an employee of one of the parties is not ipso facto a ground to raise a presumption of bias or partiality or lack of independence on B his part. There can however be a justifiable apprehension about the independence or impartiality of an employee arbitrator, if such person was the controlling or dealing authority in regard to the subject contract or if he is a direct subordinate to the officer whose decision is the subject- matter of the dispute. C 22.1.2. Unless the cause of action for invoking jurisdiction under clauses (a), (b) or (c) of sub-section (6) of Section 11 of the 1996 Act arises, there is no question of the Chief Justice or his designate exercising power under sub-section (6) of Section 11.
