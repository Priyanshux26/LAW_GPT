Thereupon, the petitioner’s counsel sought liberty to approach the Trial Court by way of an appropriate application challenging the sanction. Accepting that plea, the High Court disposed of the application, vide dated 15.12.2020, granting liberty to the petitioner to approach the Trial Court and challenge the sanction . Signifi cantly, at the time of fi ling of this fi rst petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the charge sheet was very much on record and the learned Sessions Judge, Rampur, had already taken cognizance. 7. However, it was only in the year 2022 that the petitioner felt inspired to fi le a second petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C., viz., Criminal Misc. Application No. 2014 of 2022. His prayers therein were to quash the charge sheet dated 30.04.2015; the cognizance dated 12.06.2015; and the proceedings in Special Case No. 19 of 2016, insofar as he was concerned. This application was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court, vide dated 20.02.2023. Therein, the High Court noted that the petitioner had earlier fi led Criminal Misc. Application No. 8465 of 2018 under Section 482 Cr.P.C. with a limited prayer - to quash the sanction dated 30.12.2013. Holding that it was not open to the petitioner to go on challenging the proceedings one by one and as he had not felt aggrieved by the charge sheet or the of cognizance when he had fi led the fi rst petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the High Court concluded that the subsequent petition challenging the same would not be maintainable and dismissed the application. It is against this that the petitioner approached this Court by way of the present case. 8. On behalf of the petitioner, Mr. Pradeep Kumar Singh Baghel, learned senior counsel, would argue that a second petition is maintainable under Section 482 Cr.P.C.. He relied on the of this Court in Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Aff airs, West Bengal vs. BHISHAM LAL VERMA v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH 59 [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] Mohan Singh and others1. Therein, it was held that a subsequent application under Section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, presently Section 482 Cr.P.C, would be maintainable in changed circumstances. It was affi rmed that a subsequent application, which is not a repeat application squarely on the same facts and circumstances, would be maintainable. To the same eff ect was the more recent decision of this Court in Anil Khadkiwala vs. State (Government of NCT of Delhi) and another2. Earlier, in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. Neeta Bhalla and another3, this Court held that when the fi rst petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C was withdrawn with liberty to avail remedies, if any, available in law, the High Court would not be denuded of its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. on being petitioned again and the principle of res judicata would not stand attracted. Again, in Vinod Kumar, IAS. vs. Union of India and others4, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court observed that dismissal of an earlier petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C would not bar fi ling of a subsequent petition thereunder in case the facts so justify.
