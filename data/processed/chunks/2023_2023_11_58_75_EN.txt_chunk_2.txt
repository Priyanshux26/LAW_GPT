The relief sought in this petition is for quashing of the impugned FIR dated 11.08.2022 registered as Case Crime No.175 of 2022 under Section 506 IPC Police Station Mirzapur, District Saharanpur. Further prayer has been made not to arrest the petitioner in the aforesaid case. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned FIR has been lodged on false/ vexatious/ mischievous allegations, and no off ences are made out against the petitioner. Learned AGA opposed the prayer for quashing of the FIR, which discloses cognizable off ence. Perusal of the impugned fi rst information report prima facie reveals commission of cognizable off ence. The correctness of the allegations would have to be tested on the basis of the materials collected during the course of investigation as by insertion of notifi cation No.1058/79-V-1-19-1 (Ka)- 20-2018 dated 6th June 2019 and therefore, in view of the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Haryana and others vs. Bhajan Lal and others, 1992 Supp.
