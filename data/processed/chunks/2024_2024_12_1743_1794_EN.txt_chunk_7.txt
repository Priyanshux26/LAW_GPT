20/2020 under Sections 21, 25, 27-A, 29, 61, 85 of the NDPS Act and under Sections 30, 54, 59 of the Arms Act. Similarly, Chargesheet was filed in FIR No.23/2020 under Sections 21, 25, 27-A, 29, 61, 85 of the NDPS Act. Both the above chargesheets were, inter alia, against the petitioner herein. Notably, in both Chargesheets, at column 2 i.e. ‘Accused who were not challaned’ one “Simarjeet Singh Sandhu” is mentioned. 3.6 The Central Government upon receipt of information regarding FIR No.01/2018 registered with PS ATS, Ahmedabad, Gujarat formed an opinion that a Schedule Offence has been committed and Sections 17 and 18 of the UAPA – (Scheduled Offence under the NIA Act) – are attracted and therefore the Central Government in exercise of powers under Section 6(5) read with Section 8 of the NIA Act directed NIA to take up the investigation by dated 29.06.2020. This is the first impugned in this writ petition. 3.7 It is pertinent to note that although the offences attracted in the FIR and Chargesheet fall under various sections of the NDPS 1754 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Act, the Central Government was of the opinion that Sections 17 and 18 of the UAPA were are also attracted. Consequently, FIR No. 01/2018 dated 12.08.2018 was renumbered and reregistered as FIR No. RC 26/2020/NIA/DLI dated 02.07.2020. It is crucial that after two years of the first FIR i.e. FIR No.01/2018 registered with PS ATS, Ahmedabad, Gujarat and some months after the registration of the FIR No.20/2020 and FIR No.23/2020 in Punjab, the NIA was directed to investigate FIR No.01/2018. The re-numbered FIR dated 02.07.2020 registered by NIA notes the following as wanted accused persons under column no.7: “x x x x Wanted accused persons: (9) Sahid Kasambhal Sumra, Res Mandvi, Bandar Road, Bachu Harji na vada, Kutch-West.

Therefore on 07.08.2020, Chargesheet was dispatched by NIA under Section 120-B IPC, Sections 8(c), 21(c), 24, 25, 27(A) and 29 of the NDPS Act and Sections 17 & 18 of the UAPA in the Court of Special Judge at [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1755 Ankush Vipan Kapoor v. National Investigation Agency Ahmedabad, constituted under NIA Act, 2008. The aforesaid Chargesheet listed Simarjeet Singh Sandhu as wanted accused No.2 as allegedly substantial quantity of heroin was delivered to his aides at a rented godown of Simarjeet Singh Sandhu at Aithor Village, near Unjha, Gujarat, where it was hidden for further transport to Amritsar, Punjab.
