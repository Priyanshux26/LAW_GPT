Thus, the question whether Constitutional morality can be equated with equality, fraternity and non-discrimination needs consideration. [Para 24][310-B-E] C Conclusion: 4.1. The exercise of balancing the rights under Article 26(b) with other rights under Part III and in particular Article 21 was not undertaken by the Constitution Bench in the case of Sardar D Syedna. This question is substantially in issue before the Bench of nine Judges in Sabrimala Temple Review -9JJ. Moreover, the question of whether the protection can be given by Article 26(b) to the practice of ex-communication also is to be tested on the touchstone of the concept of Constitutional morality as the said right is subject to morality and this is an important and emergent E issue. Thus, making these questions, two main grounds on which the said decision may need reconsideration by a larger Bench. [Para 32][315-A-C] 4.2.
