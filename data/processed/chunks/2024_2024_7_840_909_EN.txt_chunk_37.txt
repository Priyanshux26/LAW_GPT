These are matters which require a thorough examination by the Referral Court. The secondary inquiry that may arise at the reference stage itself is with respect to the non-arbitrability of the dispute. 26. As a general rule and a principle, the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred first authority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability. As an exception to the rule, and rarely as a demurrer, the Referral Court may reject claims which are manifestly and ex facie non-arbitrable [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. (2021) 2 SCC 1, para 154.4 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] […] 27. The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-arbitrability of a claim is only prima facie. Referral Courts must not undertake a full review of the contested facts; they must only be confined to a primary first review [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. (2021) 2 SCC 1, para 134 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] and let facts speak for themselves. This also requires the Courts to examine whether the assertion on arbitrability is bona fide or not. [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] The prima facie scrutiny of the facts must lead to a clear conclusion that there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is non-arbitrable. [BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd. (2021) 5 SCC 738, para 47 : (2021) 3 SCC (Civ) 352] On the other hand, even if there is the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the dispute to arbitration [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. (2021) 2 SCC 1, para 154.4 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549].” (Emphasis supplied) 894 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 91. The justification given in NTPC v. SPML (supra) for allowing the scrutiny of arbitrability at the stage of Section 11 petition was that the referral court is under a duty to protect the parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably non-arbitrable, and any interference by the referral court preventing such ex-facie meritless arbitration could be termed as legitimate. It was observed thus: “28. The limited scrutiny, through the eye of the needle, is necessary and compelling. It is intertwined with the duty of the Referral Court to protect the parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably non- arbitrable . It has been termed as a legitimate interference by Courts to refuse reference in to prevent wastage of public and private resources [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. (2021) 2 SCC 1, para 139 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549]. Further, as noted in Vidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549], if this duty within the limited compass is not exercised, and the Court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may undermine the effectiveness of both, arbitration and the Court [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. (2021) 2 SCC 1, para 139 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549].
