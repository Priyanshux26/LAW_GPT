CONCLUSION ................................................................. 49 I. INTRODUCTION 1. India is home to thousands of community-protected forests known as ‘Sacred groves’. These areas are patches of forest or clusters of trees that hold deep cultural or spiritual significance for the local communities that protect and sustain them. 2. As defined by Collins Dictionary, the term “sacred” describes ‘something that is sacred is believed to be holy and to have a special connection with God’, while “grove” refers to a ‘group of trees that are * Ed.

Sacred groves, therefore, symbolize a harmonious blend of natural and spiritual elements, embodying both ecological and cultural value. 3. Sacred groves are conserved by the local residents for a variety of reasons, ranging from belief in a forest deity to the protection of a spring or as sacred space where ancestors are buried.1 The size of sacred groves ranges from very small plots of less than 1 hectare to larger tracts of land of several hundred hectares.2 In some cases, these fragments of sacred groves represent the sole remaining natural forests outside of protected areas and, therefore making them some of the last locations with potential for the conservation of flora and fauna. 4. Sacred groves, like Living Root Bridges of Meghalaya (a UNESCO recognised World Heritage Site), locally recognized as Jingkieng Jri, show the deep connection between people and nature. The Living Root Bridges, built by the Khasi tribes, are an incredible example of traditional knowledge, where Ficus trees are carefully grown to form strong, living structures.
