[Paras 4, 19, 20] Societies Registration Act, 1860 – Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950 – Whether the 7 Objectors were entitled to a notice for the meeting of 08.09.2002 in view of their disqualification u/s. 15 of the Registration Act: Held: It is not in dispute that all the Objectors were in arrears of their membership fee for a period of more than three months – This fact is admitted as is recorded by not only the High Court but all the three authorities – The specific language used in s. 15 of the Registration Act is that such members in default of membership fee would not be entitled to vote and would not be counted as members of the Society – If they were not entitled to vote and they were not to be counted as members, there would be no illegality or for that matter any prejudice being caused by not issuing any notice as the same would be an exercise in futility. [Para 22] Societies Registration Act, 1860 – Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950 – Whether lack of notice to the said 7 Objectors would vitiate the entire election meeting of 08.09.2002: Held: It is true that in the bye-laws of the present Society or the Rules of the Society, there is no provision of automatic cessation of membership where a member goes in default of payment of membership fee for more than three months – However, the effect of the proviso to Section 15 of the Registration Act which admittedly is applicable to the Society, the Objectors have to be treated as suspended members and therefore, would not be entitled to any notice as they had no right to vote or to be counted as members 1064 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports – Once they are not to be counted as members, there was no occasion to give them notice as such Non-issuance of notice to the Objectors would not vitiate the proceeding of the special meeting held on 08.09.2002. [Para 26] Societies Registration Act, 1860 – Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950 – Whether invalid members had signed the requisition dated 20.08.2002 and had been elected to the Executive Committee: Held: The signatories at serial nos. 12 to 16 of the requisition dated 20.08.2002, had been duly admitted in the General Body Meeting on 11.11.2001 – The said resolution of the meeting was never challenged – The same is on record as Exhibit 131 and one of the Objectors DVS was a signatory in the said proceeding – With respect to the objections relating to signatory nos. 4 to 7, the explanation is that were of the category of Employee Members – In due course they had retired from service – However, even after their retirement, they had continued to pay their subscription – As their membership(s) have continued, at this stage, objection(s) with regard to the validity thereof is not being examined in detail, given the lack of clarity and absence of material facts on this aspect.
