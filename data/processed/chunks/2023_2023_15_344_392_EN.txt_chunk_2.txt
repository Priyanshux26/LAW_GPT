DAKSHIN GUJARAT VIJ COMPANY LTD. v. M/S. GAYATRI 347 SHAKTI PAPER AND BOARD LTD. Power w.r.t proportionality requirement agreed with, elaborated by referring to the clarifi cations and the illustrations provided on behalf of the appellant – Interpretation given checks, “gaming”, by owners, which would amount to misuse and abuse of the r.3(1)(a) of the Rules – Instances of gaming are where a 1% or an insignifi cant shareholder of the CGP disproportionately uses the electricity generated, in which case he should not be treated as a group captive user and, therefore, should be denied the benefi ts that are given under the Act to the captive users. [Paras 42, 43 and 45] Electricity Act, 2003 – s.2(8) – Categories of Captive Generating Plants (CGPs) – Electricity Rules, 2005 – Proviso to r.3(1)(a) – Group captive users which are not registered cooperative societies, to comply with the test of proportionality: Held: s.2(8) of the Act recognises two categories of CGPs, single captive users and group captive users – For group captive users, only two categories of users are recognised, that is, a cooperative society and association of persons – The fi rst proviso to r.3(1)(a) of the Rules creates an exception for cooperative societies – It requires members of the cooperative society to only collectively satisfy the minimum ownership and electricity consumption requirements specifi ed under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of r.3(1) (a) of Rules – The second proviso to r.3(1)(a), which refers to association of persons, requires such captive users to satisfy the minimum ownership and electricity consumption requirements specifi ed under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of r.3(1)(a) of Rules – Additionally, it also requires such captive users to consume electricity generated by the CGP, which shall not be less than 51%, in proportion to their individual shares in the ownership of the CGP, which shall not be less than 26% - Thus, under the Rules, all group captive users which are not registered cooperative societies are required to comply with the test of proportionality specifi ed in the second proviso to Rule 3(1) (a) – Second proviso to r.3(1)(a) of the Rules is not case specifi c – It is to be treated as corollary to the interpretation embedded under s. 2(8) of the Act, that is, “primarily for its own use” – In make the enactment under s. 2(8) of the Act workable in any instance where group captive users are not registered cooperative societies, the rule of proportionality under the second proviso to r.3(1)(a) of the Rules should be read as a mandatory condition 348 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. – Second proviso to r.3(1)(a) of the Rules is in furtherance of s.2(8) of the Act. [Paras 61-63] Electricity Rules, 2005 – Second proviso to r.3(1)(a) – Change in ownership or shareholding of the CGP, applicability of the second proviso of r.3(1)(a): Held: In case of change of ownership, shareholding, or consumption, the principle of weighted average should be applied to ensure compliance of the proportional electricity consumption requirement stipulated under the second proviso to Rule 3(1)(a) – The weighted average shareholding method is applied by taking average shareholding held by particular shareholder for the year for the purpose of calculating proportionate electricity required to be consumed by it in terms of the second proviso of Rule 3(1)(a) – Weighted shareholding and proportionate consumption of electricity is the fair, equitable and the correct method to determine whether the essential requirements of the second proviso to Rule 3(1)(a) are satisfi ed.
