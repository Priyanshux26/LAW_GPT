In the complaint filed by the deceased complainant on 17th April2000, in the form of his F statement recorded by the Anti- Corruption Bureau, he has stated that pursuant to the application dated 6th May 1996, a meter was installed in his shop and after a few months, he found that the meter was removed. However, the Special Court has observed in paragraph 19 of the impugned that a complaint regarding a stolen electricity meter G was registered at the instance of the complainant on 25th April 2000. Thus, the grievance regarding stolen meter was made by the complainant 8 days after the alleged demand for bribe. In fact, PW-7 admitted that the complainant did not produce a copy of the application made by him for providing electricity meter. PW-7 further stated that the complainant did not clearly tell him that he had given such application. In absence of H NEERAJ DUTTA v. STATE (GOVT. OF N.C.T. OF DELHI) 1013 [ABHAY S. OKA, J.] proof of making such application, the prosecution’s case regarding demand A of bribe for installing new electricity meter becomes doubtful. Moreover, till 24th April 2000, the complainant did not register a complaint regarding commission of offence. This makes the prosecution’s case regarding the demand of gratification on 17th April 2000 for installing a new electricity meter extremely doubtful. B 19. In the present case, there are no circumstances brought on record which will prove the demand for gratification. Therefore, the ingredients of the offence under Section 7 of the PC Act were not established and consequently, the offence under Section 13(1)(d) will not be attracted. C 20. Hence, the appeal must succeed. We set aside the impugned and the of the Special Court and set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant. The bail bonds of the appellant stand cancelled. Appeal is allowed. D Nidhi Jain Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Yash Chavan and Tamana, LCRAs) E F G H
