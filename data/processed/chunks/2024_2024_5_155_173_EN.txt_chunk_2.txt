The main issue that arises in this case is whether the High Court was justified in passing a drastic in the exercise of writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India permitting the 1st and 2nd respondents (writ petitioners) to construct a compound wall under police protection. The passed by a Division Bench of the High Court on 16th March 2022 is in terms of the “Minutes of ” tendered to the Court by the advocates representing the parties duly signed by them. The practice of passing s based on “Minutes of ” submitted by the advocates representing the parties prevails perhaps only in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay (for short, ‘the Bombay High Court’).

One petition was filed by the 1st respondent against one Urvaksh Naval Hoyvoy and others. Taz Naval Nariman and another filed the other petition. Consent terms were filed in the Arbitration Petition preferred by the 1st respondent. It appears that during the pendency of the proceeding of the Arbitration Petition, Urvaksh Naval Hoyvoy was arrested by police based on a First Information Report. In terms of the consent terms dated 28th April 2018, the learned Single [2024] 5 S.C.R. 159 Ajay Ishwar Ghute & Ors. v. Meher K. Patel & Ors. Judge passed an dated 30th April 2018. Further, dated 10th May 2018 passed by the learned Single Judge records that the process of handing over possession of the suit property by the respondents to the 1st respondent has commenced. The dispute in the Arbitration Petitions related to the lands of Parsi Dairy Farm. 3. The 7th respondent in Arbitration Petition No. 451 of 2018 filed an interim application in the disposed of Arbitration Petitions more than two years after filing consent terms.
