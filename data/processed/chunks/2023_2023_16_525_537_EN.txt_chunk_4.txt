The suspension was revoked, however, the departmental inquiry remained pending till superannuation. In any case, reference in the aforesaid was made to Rajender Lal Capoor-I (supra) and not to the views expressed by a Three-judge Bench of this Court in Canara Bank (supra), which upheld the views expressed by a Two-Judge Bench in Rajinder Lal Capoor -II (supra). 12. He further submitted that the 1979 Regulations do not provide for any procedure to be followed for inquiry or the punishment which can be imposed. For this, the disciplinary authority will have to refer to the 1976 Regulations, which provide that after retirement of an employee, the only punishment which could be awarded is with reference to the retiral benefi ts and not termination from service. 13. It was further submitted by learned counsel for the respondent no.1 that even if the amendment to Regulation 20 of the 1979 Regulations as proposed by the Bank had been approved by the Reserve Bank of India and thereafter by the Government of India and adopted by the appellant- Bank on 17.04.1986, however, any amendment in the Regulations would take eff ect only after its publication in the Offi cial Gazette in terms of the amendment made in Section 19(1) of the 1970Act.10 Admittedly, the idea behind the publication in the Offi cial Gazette is to make the aff ected people aware about the changes in law.

On failure of publication in the Offi cial Gazette, the amended provisions of Regulation 20 could not be enforced against the respondent no.1. The counsel for the respondent no.1 referred to the of this Court in B.K. Srinivasan v. State of 10 The Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970. 532 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. Karnataka, (1987) 1 SCC 658 and Rajendra Agricultural University v. Ashok Kumar Prasad, (2010) 1 SCC 730. He further submitted that even prior to the of this Court in Rajender Lal Capoor-II (supra), this Court in United Bank of India Offi cers Association v. United Bank of India, 1987 (1) LLJ 104, had struck down the 1979 Regulations. 14. He further submitted that even the Government of India vide letter dated 15.12.1988, addressed to all Nationalised Banks, requested that the Regulation 20 of the 1979 Regulations having been held to be ultra vires by this Court in United Bank of India Offi cers Association’s case (supra), the same should not be invoked by the Banks. 15. While concluding the argument, counsel for the respondent no.1 submitted that, the respondent no.1 had expired on 30.12.2012. He is now represented by his legal representatives. No retiral dues were paid to the employee (i.e., respondent no.
