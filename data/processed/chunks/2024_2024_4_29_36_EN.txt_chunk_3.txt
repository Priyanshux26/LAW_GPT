6 (1970) 3 SCC 694 7 [2002] Supp. 2 SCR 350 : (2002) 8 SCC 87 8 [1954] 1 SCR 1144 : AIR 1954 SC 397 34 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 10. We notice that this Court in Vishnu Dutt Sharma vs. Daya Sapra (Smt. )9, had observed as under: “26. It is, however, significant to notice a decision of this Court in Karam Chand Ganga Prasad v. Union of India (1970) 3 SCC 694, wherein it was categorically held that the decisions of the civil court will be binding on the criminal courts but the converse is not true, was overruled therein…” This Court in Satish Chander Ahuja vs. Sneha Ahuja10 considered a numerous precedents, including Premshanker (supra) and Vishnu Dutt Sharma (supra), to opine that there is no embargo for a civil court to consider the evidence led in the criminal proceedings. The issue has been laid to rest by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Iqbal Singh Marwah vs. Meenakshi Marwah11 : “32. Coming to the last contention that an effort should be made to avoid conflict of findings between the civil and criminal courts, it is necessary to point out that the standard of proof required in the two proceedings are entirely different. Civil cases are decided on the basis of preponderance of evidence, while in a criminal case, the entire burden lies on the prosecution, and proof beyond reasonable doubt has to be given. There is neither any statutory provision nor any legal principle that the findings recorded in one proceeding may be treated as final or binding in the other, as both the cases have to be decided on the basis of the evidence adduced therein. While examining a similar contention in an appeal against an directing filing of a complaint under Section 476 of the old Code, the following observations made by a Constitution Bench in M.S. Sheriff v. State of Madras [1954 SCR 1144 : AIR 1954 SC 397: 1954 Cri LJ 1019] give a complete answer to the problem posed: (AIR p. 399, paras 15-16) 9 [2009] 7 SCR 977 : (2009) 13 SCC 729 10 [2020] 12 SCR 189 : (2021) 1 SCC 414 11 [2005] 2 SCR 708 : (2005) 4 SCC 370 [2024] 4 S.C.R. 35 Prem Raj v. Poonamma Menon & Anr. “15. As between the civil and the criminal proceedings, we are of the opinion that the criminal matters should be given precedence. There is some difference of opinion in the High Courts of India on this point. No hard-and-fast rule can be laid down but we do not consider that the possibility of conflicting decisions in the civil and criminal courts is a relevant consideration. The law envisages such an eventuality when it expressly refrains from making the decision of one court binding on the other, or even relevant, except for certain limited purposes, such as sentence or damages. The only relevant consideration here is the likelihood of embarrassment. 16. Another factor which weighs with us is that a civil suit often drags on for years and it is undesirable that a criminal prosecution should wait till everybody concerned has forgotten all about the crime.
