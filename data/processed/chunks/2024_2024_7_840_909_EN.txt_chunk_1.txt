[Paras 59, 93, 135, 136] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – Arbitration agreement contained in a substantive contract, if survives even after the underlying contract is discharged by “accord and satisfaction”: Held: Arbitration for the purpose of resolving any dispute pertaining to any claim which has been “fully and finally settled” between the parties can only be invoked if the arbitration agreement survives even after the discharge of the substantive contract – Arbitration agreement, by virtue of the presumption of separability, survives the principal contract in which it was contained – Even if the contracting parties, in pursuance of a settlement, agree to discharge each other of any obligations arising under the contract, this does not ipso facto mean that the arbitration agreement too would come to an end, unless the parties expressly agree to do the same – Intention of the parties in discharging a contract by 842 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “accord and satisfaction” is to relieve each other of the existing or any new obligations under the contract – Such a discharge of obligations under the substantive contract cannot be construed to mean that the parties also intended to relieve each other of their obligation to settle any dispute pertaining to the original contract through arbitration – Although ordinarily no arbitrable disputes may subsist after execution of a full and final settlement, yet any dispute pertaining to the full and final settlement itself, by necessary implication being a dispute arising out of or in relation to or under the substantive contract, would not be precluded from reference to arbitration as the arbitration agreement contained in the original contract continues to be in existence even after the parties have discharged the original contract by “accord and satisfaction”.

SPML’s case that the jurisdiction of the referral court when dealing with the issue of “accord and satisfaction” u/s. 11 extends to weeding out ex-facie non-arbitrable and frivolous disputes would continue to apply despite the subsequent decision in In Re: Interplay’s case.
