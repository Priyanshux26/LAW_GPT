23. Similar was the case with reference to the accused nos. 2 & 3, namely, Rajesh Gupta and Dinesh Gupta, appellants before this Court. Their incomplete addresses have been mentioned reflecting them to be the residents of Sector 20, Gautam Budh Nagar. The position is same in the case of Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech. Though the complainant had invested crores of rupees in equity of the aforesaid two companies based at New Delhi, knowing well their place of business, yet in those cases, incomplete addresses showing them at Sector 20, Gautam Budh Nagar, was deliberately mentioned. It is sufficiently clear that the idea was to falsely create jurisdiction in Gautam Budh Nagar which did not actually lie there. 24. The falsehood in the complaint, filed with reference to the addresses of the accused, was established at the time of filing of charge-sheet. Whereas in the FIR, the addresses of all the accused given were incomplete merely mentioning the address as ‘Sector 20, Gautam Budh Nagar’, in the charge-sheet addresses of not only the appellants, namely, Rajesh Gupta and Dinesh Gupta, were found to be ‘D-393, New Friends Colony, New Delhi, even Sushil Gupta and Baljeet Singh were also found to be residents of New Delhi. The following are the addresses of the parties involved in the matter: Sr. Party Party Name Address No. 1. Complainant Karan N-56, Panchsheel Park, Gambhir New Delhi, 110017. 2.
