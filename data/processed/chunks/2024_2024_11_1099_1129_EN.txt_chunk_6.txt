It has come on record that the buyer, despite being present in Coimbatore, falsely represented in her reply dated 18th March, 2006 that she was out of station and, hence, was disabled to respond immediately. The conduct of the buyer, therefore, does not inspire confidence and certainly such conduct was sufficient to deny her equitable relief. 8.4. Fourthly, Mr. Dwivedi contended that the buyer was never ready and willing to perform her part of the bargain and hence she was not entitled to the relief of specific performance. To show the reluctance of the buyer to go ahead with the transaction, various communications by and between the parties were referred to. The reply dated 24th February, 2006 was first referred wherefrom it would be evident that the buyer was aware of the fact of vacation of the property by the last remaining tenant. Vide telegram dated 11th March, 2006, the sellers called upon the buyer to hand over the pay and gave time till 24th March, 2006 to pay the balance sale amount and register the sale deed. Despite this, the buyer did not initiate any positive action as evidence of her readiness and willingness. Again, vide letter dated 23rd March, 2006, the sellers informed the buyer that they had applied for the encumbrance certificate, even though provision of such certificate was not a term of the Agreement. The sellers again called upon the buyer to execute the sale deed within 7 (seven) days from the date of receipt of the certificate. Even then, the buyer did not take steps to complete the sale. The sellers sent the encumbrance certificate as requested vide letter dated 06th April, 2006, and asked the buyer to execute the sale deed within 5 (five) days; however, even then, the buyer did not do the needful. Ultimately, having no other option, the sellers finally had to cancel the Agreement vide letter dated 26th April, 2006. Thereafter, the buyer maintained silence for four months. There is no reasonable justification for such silence. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1109 R. Kandasamy (Since Dead) & Ors. v. T.R.K. Sarawathy & Anr. 8.5. Fifthly, Mr. Dwivedi submitted that the buyer has nowhere pleaded that she had purchased the stamp papers for execution of the sale deed. This further suggests that the buyer was not ready and willing to perform her part of the obligations under the Agreement. 8.6. Sixthly, Mr. Dwivedi argued that the buyer had taken prevaricating stands and, therefore, is not entitled to the discretionary relief of specific performance. He drew our attention to the letter dated 24th February, 2006 wherein the buyer stated: “It appears that only few days ago, the tenant has vacated and the portion is kept under lock and key.” This shows that the buyer was aware of the fact of vacation of the property by the last tenant days prior to 24th February, 2006. However, in her letter dated 18th March, 2006, she stated that: “You have vacated all the tenants only on 02.02.2006 and it has been officially intimated to me only on 04.03.2006 by your letter dated 02.03.2006”.
