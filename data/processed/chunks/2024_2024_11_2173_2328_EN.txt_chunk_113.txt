Despite there being no express statutory proscription against unilaterality in matters of appointment, in one of its decisions, the Massachusetts District Court remarked that “both the parties to a dispute must have an equal right to 94 Born (supra), 1878. 95 Judgement of 26 November 2002, DFT 4P_129/2002. 96 Philipp Bros. v. Icco, 1990 Rev. 880,883; Raffineries de Petrole d’Homs et de Banias v. Chambre de Commerce Internationale, 1985 Recv. Arb. 141,146 97 of 31 January, 2002, 2003:2 Cahiers de l’Arbitrage 303. 98 Judgement of 11 November 1981, DFT 107 Ia 155,158 (Swiss Fed. Trib.). [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2321 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company participate in the appointment process.”99 Similarly, in another case,100 the Supreme Court of Alabama invalidated an arbitration agreement as being unconscionable for the reason that it excluded one party from the appointment process. Further, in Hooters of America, Inc. v. Phillips,101 the arbitration clause was held to be against rules of neutrality and the award refused enforcement because one party was given exclusive control over the panel of potential arbitrators from which the other party could select its nominee arbitrator. It was observed that: “In this case, the challenge goes to the validity of the arbitration agreement itself. Hooters materially breached the arbitration agreement by promulgating rules so egregiously unfair as to constitute a complete default of its contractual obligation to draft arbitration rules and to do so in good faith. Hooters and Phillips agreed to settle any disputes between them not in a judicial forum, but in another neutral forum -- arbitration. Their agreement provided that Hooters was responsible for setting up such a forum by promulgating arbitration rules and procedures. To this end, Hooters instituted a set of rules in July 1996. The Hooters rules when taken as a whole, however, are so one-sided that their only possible purpose is to undermine the neutrality of the proceeding.” Further, on the question of unilateral composition of panel, the court remarked: “The Hooters rules also provide a mechanism for selecting a panel of three arbitrators that is crafted to ensure a biased decisionmaker. Rule 8. The employee and Hooters each select an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators in turn select a third. Good enough, except that the employee’s arbitrator and the third arbitrator must be selected from a list of arbitrators created exclusively by Hooters. This gives Hooters control over the entire panel and places no limits whatsoever on whom Hooters can put on the list. Under 99 Rosenberg v. Merril Lynch, Pierce, Fennner & Smith, Inc. 995 F.Supp. 190,208. 100 Harold Allen’s Mobile Home Factory Outlet, Inc. v. Butler, 825 So.2d 779,783-85 (Ala. 2002) 101 39 F. Supp. 2d 582 (D.S.C. 1998). 2322 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the rules, Hooters is free to devise lists of partial arbitrators who have existing relationships, financial or familial, with Hooters and its management. In fact, the rules do not even prohibit Hooters from placing its managers themselves on the list.
