Hence, even if Respondent 2 complainant is of the opinion that the monetary demand or claim is incorrect and not payable, given the failure to prove the requirements of Section 405 IPC, an offence under the same section is not constituted. In the absence of factual allegations which satisfy the ingredients of the offence under Section 405IPC, a mere dispute on monetary demand of Rs 6,37,252.16p, does not attract criminal prosecution under Section 406IPC.” 10. The same view was expressed by this Court in the cases of Prof. R.K. Vijayasarathy and Anr. -vs- Sudha Seetharam and Anr. [(2019) 16 SCC 739] and Vijay Kumar Ghai and Ors. -vs- State of West Bengal and Ors. [(2022) 7 SCC 124]. The of this Court in the case of Dalip Kaur and Ors. -vs- Jagnar Singh and Anr. [(2009) 14 SCC 696] has also been cited in support of the appellant’s case and in this decision it has been, inter-alia, held:- “10. The High Court, therefore, should have posed a question as to whether any act of inducement on the part of the appellant has been raised by the second respondent and whether the appellant had an intention to cheat him from the very inception. If the dispute between the parties was essentially a civil dispute resulting from a breach of contract on the part of the appellants by non-refunding the amount of advance the same would not constitute an offence of cheating. Similar is the legal position in respect of an offence of criminal breach of trust having regard to its definition contained in Section 405 of the Penal Code.” [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1145 Sachin Garg v. State of U.P. and Anr. This goes for allegations relating to Section 406 of the 1860 Code. 11. So far as the allegations of commission of offence under Sections 504 and 506 of the 1860 Code are concerned, we have gone through the petition of complaint as well as the initial depositions. The allegations pertaining to the aforesaid provisions of the 1860 Code surfaces in the last portion of the petition of complaint. The complainant, in his initial deposition has not made any statement relatable to criminal intimidation. But his father made the following statement at that stage under Section 202 of the 1973 Code:- “…With effect from 18.07.2019, the Opposite Party had fixed rate of job work as Rs.1.65/- per piece with the company of my son, which remained continued till December, 2019 and Opposite Party used to make payment of job work to my son, also on this rate and an amount of Rs. 9,36,693.18/- of my son was due for payment on the Opposite Party, due to which, he demanded the Opposite Party to make payment, but, Opposite Party did not make payment and after doing calculation on less rates, he said that no amount is due for payment and on demanding money, the Opposite Party has abused my son with filthy language and has threatened him to kill. An amount of Rs.
