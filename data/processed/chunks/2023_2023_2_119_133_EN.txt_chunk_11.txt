H PREMCHAND v. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA 133 [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] 29. The appeal stands allowed to the extent indicated above. No A costs. 30. Before parting, we observe that this is a case where the police should have investigated the injuries suffered by the appellant too. The appellant also did not pursue any available remedy to right the wrong. However, in view of little less than a decade having passed since the B incident took place, any direction to investigate at this distance of time may not yield any fruitful result. We, therefore, refrain from issuing such direction. Ankit Gyan Appeal allowed. C (Assisted by : Aarsh Choudhary, LCRA) D E F G H
