Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, Adv. for the Respondents. / of the Supreme Court Vikram Nath, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. By means of this appeal, the accused has assailed the correctness of the and dated 11.08.2022 passed by the Calcutta High Court in CRA No.222/2020 whereby the High Court allowed the appeal filed by the complainant (respondent no.2) and after setting aside the acquittal recorded by the Trial Court on 31.09.2020, remanded the case to proceed in a manner whereby the Trial Court would first decide the application under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19731 and thereafter proceed to decide the trial. Brief facts relating to the present case are: 3. That the First Information Report2 was lodged by respondent no.2 alleging that the appellant had tried to kidnap him which was registered under sections 366/323/506(II) of the Indian Penal Code, 18603 with section 25(1)(B)(a) of the Arms Act, 1950 as FIR No. 125 on 11.10.2017. After investigation, a charge-sheet was submitted on 08.02.2019 under the aforesaid sections. 4. During the trial the Examination-in-Chief of the victim (respondent no.2) PW1, her mother Sabiya Rahaman (PW 2) and her father Aslam Shaikh (PW 3) were recorded. However, their cross-examination was deferred on an application made by the accused-appellant. The Examination-in-Chief was conducted on 29.02.2020. On 07.03.2020 an application under section 319 CrPC was filed by respondent no.2 for further summoning the father and mother of the accused-appellant. Thereafter it appears that the above three prosecution witnesses did 1 CrPC 2 FIR 3 IPC 914 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports not appear before the Trial Court for their cross-examination despite having received the summons. On 14.09.2020 again an adjournment was sought on behalf of PWs 1, 2 and 3 whereupon the Trial Court recorded that despite the specific repeated s, the prosecution witnesses are not coming forward for cross-examination and that the witnesses as such are wilfully disobeying the s of the Court. The Trial Court directed that the cross-examination of the witnesses is fixed for the next date and s would be passed on the application under section 319 CrPC after the examination of all the witnesses are over.
