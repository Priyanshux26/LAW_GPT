Under Section 102 of the Evidence Act, the burden of proof rests on the party who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side. Where the defendant admits the facts alleged by the plaintiff but contends that the plaintiff is not entitled to any part of the relief which he seeks, it is the defendant who gets the right to begin. 17. XVIII of the Code of Civil Procedure in terms speaks of the ‘hearing’ of a suit and not the trial of the suit. A court is concerned with the trial of a suit from the time when it is instituted. The hearing of a suit is only a part of the trial of the suit. The determination of the question as to which party has a right to begin is an integral part of the hearing itself. 18. XVIII Rule 1 indeed provides for plaintiff’s right to begin the evidence but not the court’s obligation to ask the plaintiffs to begin first. There is no impediment for the court to call upon either party to lead evidence first, depending upon the facts and circumstances [2024] 12 S.C.R. 651 Jami Venkata Suryaprabha and Anr. v. Tarini Prasad Nayak and Ors. of the case and the nature of the issues framed. Neither party can insist that the other one should be asked to lead it first. It all depends upon what the Court deems proper in the circumstances. Where it finds that defendant’s plea strikes of the root of the case, there would be no hitch in asking him/her to prove such plea first which can lead to disposal of the case. There can be no watertight compartmentalisation in matters of justice and all rules of procedure are designed and directed to achieve and secure ends of justice. 19. In such circumstances, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned passed by the High Court. 20. With these observations, the SLP stands disposed of. 21. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of. Result of the case: SLP disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
