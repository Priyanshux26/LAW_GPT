That it is well settled that the legislature is well competent to legislate retrospectively. That though, retrospectivity of an enactment may not be presumed, the same can be done through express enactment or by necessary implication. Therefore, if the legislature is competent and the intention of the legislature to expand G the scope of the statute can be gathered, whether expressly or by necessary implication, the same shall be given effect to. In support of the above submission, reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Government of Andhra Pradesh Vs. Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd., (1975) 2 SCC 274 (para 10) and Lily Thomas Vs. Union of India (2013) 7 SCC 653 (para 21). H 770 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A 4.10 It is further submitted by Shri Nataraj, learned ASG that the High Court has erred in holding that the respondents have a “vested right” and the amendment to Section 153C of the Act, 1961 affects such vested substantive right of the respondents. That no such substantive rights are vested in the respondents. Once the conditions enumerated in Section 153C are satisfied, no liability is fastened ipso facto. It is B submitted that the authorities issued a show cause notice and thereafter proceedings were initiated in accordance with law. Therefore, the High Court has erred in quashing the proceedings at the initial stage of show cause notice by holding that substantive rights of the respondents are affected. C 4.11 Making above submissions, it is vehemently submitted that the High Court has committed a grave error in holding that Section 153C as amended by the Finance Act, 2015 w.e.f. 01.06.2015, though a machinery provision, will only apply to search proceedings initiated after the amendment in Section 153C. D 4.12 Making above submissions, it is prayed that the present appeals be allowed and the impugned common and passed by the High Court be quashed and set aside. 5. While opposing the present appeals, the counsel appearing on behalf of the respective assessees have vehemently submitted that the E controversy in the present group of appeals is with respect to the point of applicability of the extant law in search cases, i.e., whether Section 153C of the Act, 1961 as amended with effect from 01.06.2015 would be applicable to cases where search is initiated prior to that date. 5.1 It is submitted that the issue has arisen because with effect F from 01.06.2015, i.e., after the date of the search, but before the issuance of Section 153C notice, the law has been amended vide the Finance Act, 2015 to expand the scope of third parties covered by the search to include a new set of assessees. It is submitted that on the basis of this amendment, notices under Section 153C of the Act, 1961 were issued to assessees, who were not included within the scope of the provision as it G stood on the date of the search. 5.2 It is further submitted on behalf of the respective assessees that it is the case on behalf of the Department that as Section 153C of the Act, 1961 is a procedural and machinery provision, the amendment, though made with effect from 01.06.2015, is retrospective and, thus, H INCOME TAX OFFICER v.
