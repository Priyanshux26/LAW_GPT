When Section 6 was incorporated in the text of the HSA, 1956 as it was originally enacted, Parliament was aware of the pre-existing provisions of Section 16 of the HMA 1955. When Section 6 was substituted by Act 39 of 2005, Parliament was aware of the substitution of Section 16 of the HMA 1955 by Act 68 of 1976 with eff ect from 27 May 1976. 47. At this stage, it would be material to take notice of the provisions of Section 3(j) of the HSA 1956 which defi nes the expression ‘related’ in the following terms: “(j) “related” means related by legitimate kinship: PROVIDED that illegitimate children shall be deemed to be related to their mother and to one another, and their legitimate descendants shall be deemed to be related to them and to one another; and any word expressing relationship or denoting a relative shall be construed accordingly” 48. The proviso to Section 3(j) indicates that illegitimate children ‘shall be deemed to be related to their mother and to one another’. This provision will not come in the way of an individual who is protected by Section 16(1) or (2) of the HMA 1955 in seeking a share in the estate of his or her parent in terms of Section 6(3) of the HSA in the manner which has been interpreted earlier in this . Once legitimacy has been conferred upon such an individual under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of Section 16 of the HMA 1955, the proviso to Section 3(j) which deals with “illegitimate children’’ ceases to apply to children covered under Section 16(1) and Section 16(2). 49. The interplay between the provisions of Section 16(3) of the HMA 1955 and Section 6 of the HSA 1956 has been elaborately discussed in an illuminating of a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court 362 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. in Shantaram Tukaram Patil v. Dagubai Tukaram Patil47. Justice R A Jahagirdar speaking for the Division Bench observed: “21… We have already held above that the legitimacy conferred by section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act was there even prior to the 1976 amendment. Only it was extended to some more persons. The Hindu Succession Act is no doubt an Act which is later to the Hindu Marriage Act. One must proceed on the assumption that the Parliament was aware of the provisions contained in section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act — an earlier law — and despite this it did not exclude the children who were made legitimate under section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act from the class of legitimate heirs under the Hindu Succession Act. In fact one would assume that if the Parliament wanted to exclude the “legitimate children” of section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act from the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act, it would have defi nitely provided for that eff ect. The legitimacy, therefore, created by section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act must be read into as a part of the defi nition in section 3(1) (j) of the Hindu Succession Act.
