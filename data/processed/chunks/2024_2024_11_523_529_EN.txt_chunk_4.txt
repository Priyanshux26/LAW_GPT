[2024] 11 S.C.R. 529 Devendra Kumar & Ors. v. State of Chhattisgarh 20. Taking into consideration all these aspects, the possibility of offence being committed by the appellants without premeditation in a sudden fight in a heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel cannot be ruled out. From the nature of the injuries sustained by the deceased, it cannot be said that the appellants have taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. 21. In that view of the matter, we find that the appellants would be entitled to benefit of doubt and the conviction under Section 302 IPC needs to be altered to the one under Part I of Section 304 IPC. 22. We are, therefore, inclined to partly allow the present appeal. 23. In the result, we pass the following : (i) The appeal is partly allowed. (ii) The conviction of the appellants under Section 302 IPC is altered to the one under Part I of Section 304 IPC. (iii) The appellants have already undergone a sentence of more than 12 years prior to their release on bail by the of this Court dated 17th February 2015. We find that the said sentence would subserve the ends of justice. Therefore, the appellants are sentenced to the period already undergone. (iv) The bail bonds, if any shall stand discharged. 24. We place on record our deep appreciation to Mr. Vikrant Narayan Vasudeva, learned Amicus Curiae for the valuable assistance rendered. Result of the case: Appeal partly allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
