However, the aforesaid entry was introduced only in 2002 vide an amendment15, wherein the reference to maize was explicitly removed. Prior to that amendment, Exemption Entry No. 8 which included maize was applicable. G f) It is settled law that the power under Section 28-A of the Act cannot be exercised contrary to the statutory scheme 13 (1990) SCC OnLine Mad 777 14 T.C. (R) 902/1999 15 The TNGST (Fourth Amendment) Act, 2002 H 110 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A of the Act, more particularly when the issue of classification has been settled by a court of law. This is evident from the State’s consistent practice to treat maize starch as exempt from tax, as confirmed by way of a series of circulars issued over time categorically exempting maize starch from tax liability. Having regard to the clarifications issued in favour B of exemption, the Circular dated 8th October, 1998 requiring the recovery of taxes retrospectively is a mere change of opinion without cogent reason and, therefore, is liable to be quashed. g) In any event, the aforesaid Circular cannot have a C retrospective effect and will take effect only from the date of issue, i.e., on and from 8th October, 1998. 5. Finally, submitting that for the assessment year 1998-1999 the appellant is entitled to exemption from tax on maize starch in accordance with Exemption Entry No. 8, Mr. Mani prayed that the s under D challenge be set aside by declaring the appellant’s entitlement to exemption; consequently, the appeals be allowed. 6. Mr. C. Kranthi Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the respondents while supporting the impugned , contended as follows: E a) Firstly, in the Assessment Year 1998-1999, maize starch will fall under Taxation Entry No. 61, categorized as ‘sago and starch of any kind’, and will be subject to a 4% tax rate. The term ‘starch of any kind’, encompasses all types of starch, including maize starch. The decision in Associated Cement Company Ltd. vs. Commissioner F of Customs16was relied on to support the contention that the words ‘any kind’ ought to be interpreted in an inclusive manner to include all kinds of goods within its ambit. b) Secondly, the Exemption Notification gained statutory support starting only from 1st April, 1994, through an amendment G that introduced Exemption Entry No. 8 exempting products of millets. However, Taxation Entry ‘sago and starch of any kind’ had already existed since 1993 and hence, was the applicable entry. H 16 (2001) 4 SCC 593 SANTHOSH MAIZE & INDUSTRIES LIMITED v. THE STATE 111 OF TAMIL NADU & ANR. [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] c) Thirdly, Exemption Entry No.8 modified the exempting A provision as provided under the Notification and omitted the word ‘like’ which restricted the benefit of the exemption only to the items specified therein. The decisions of this Court in Union of India vs. Tulsiram Patel17 and B. Shankara Rao Badami vs. the State of Mysore18 B were placed in support of the maxim expressum facit cessare tacitum.
