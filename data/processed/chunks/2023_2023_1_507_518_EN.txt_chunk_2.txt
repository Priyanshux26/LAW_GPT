This is the second round of litigation on the same issue. 2. This appeal by the State of Maharashtra is against the of the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay at Nagpur1, whereby the High Court has reduced the ‘irrigation restoration B charges’ which the Respondent herein has contracted to pay, from Rs.1,00,000 per hectare to Rs.50,000 per hectare. This has the effect of reducing the total liability of the Respondent towards irrigation restoration charges from Rs. 232.18 Crores to Rs.116.09 Crores. 3. The matter before us concerns the levy of ‘irrigation restoration C charge’ by the Appellant as per Government Resolution dated 01.03.2009. The Respondent and other similarly placed companies use water for industrial purposes, which is otherwise reserved for irrigation of agricultural land. The usage of water for industrial purposes is seen as loss of water for irrigation, and in to compensate for the same, the D said charge is levied and collected by the Appellant. These charges are levied after taking into account the total number of hectares which will be deprived of irrigation due to the diversion of water for industrial use. 4. The other cost levied by the Appellant is the ‘capital expenditure charge’. This charge is used towards the construction and maintenance E of dams. The payment of this charge is optional. Therefore,in the present case, we are not concerned with the levy and payment of the ‘capital expenditure charge’. Facts: F 5.
