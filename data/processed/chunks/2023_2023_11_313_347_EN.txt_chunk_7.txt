5. It is submitted that after the change of Government in the State of Uttar Pradesh in the year 2017, the ruling party came to power and immediately after the change of the Government the Petitioners along MOHAMMAD WAJID AND ANR. v. STATE OF U.P. 323 AND ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] with their family members were falsely implicated in more than 30 criminal cases at the behest of the ruling party. The Petitioners are being unnecessarily harassed by the State machinery including the Police. Although the Respondent State is heavily relying upon the criminal cases registered against the Petitioners and their family members to show that they are habitual off enders but till date the petitioners have not been convicted by any Court of law and moreover every time the Petitioners or their family members gets protection (anticipatory bail or stay of arrest) from either this Hon’ble Court or the Hon’ble High Court, the local police immediately registers false cases against them. 6. It is submitted that the alleged Look Out Notice dated 10.05.2022 was issued much prior to the registration of the present FIR No. 224 of 2022 which was registered on 19.09.2022 and as such is inconsequential. 7. It is respectfully submitted that the alleged First Information Report has been maliciously instituted at the behest of the present ruling party in the State of Uttar Pradesh to wreak vengeance and to settle political scores with Petitioner No. 2 Mohd. Iqbal alias Bala as he belongs to a rival political party and he was also a Member of Legislative Council from the period 2011 to 2016. Petitioner No. 2 Mohd. Iqbal alias Bala belongs to a respectable family of Saharanpur and he is running several Charitable Institutions. 8. The allegations made in the First Information Report do not prima facie constitute any off ence or make out a case under Sections 395, 504, 506 and 323 IPC against the Petitioner and thus, the FIR is liable to be quashed. It is pertinent to mention that even after the charge sheet has been fi led, the petition for quashing of a FIR is well within the powers of a Court of law [Please see: Anand Kumar Mohatta and another VS. State (NCT of Delhi), Department of Home & Another (2019) 11 SCC 706 at paragraph 14 & 16] 9. For the reasons mentioned above, the Special Leave Petition may be allowed and the of the Hon’ble High Court refusing to quash the FIR No. 224 of 2022 dated 19.09.2022 be set aside.” 324 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R.
