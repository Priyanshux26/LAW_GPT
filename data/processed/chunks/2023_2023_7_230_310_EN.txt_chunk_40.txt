1 except that H Respondent No. 1 substituted JKSL pursuant to AAIFR ; BISHAMBHAR PRASAD v. M/s. ARFAT PETROCHEMICALS 287 PVT. LTD. AND ORS. [SURYA KANT, J.] (e) the non-applicability of second part of Rule 12 was reinforced A when transfer lease deeds were executed in favour of Respondent No.1 in 2007 by the State Government through the Collector and not by RIICO; (f) We are informed that even lease rent has also been deposited by Respondent No. 1 continuously for years post 2007 with the B Tehsildar, Kota, and not with RIICO; and (g) There has been no formal agreement as lessee and sub-lessee between RIICO and Respondent No. 1 with the concurrence of State Government. 56. Another argument raised by Respondent No. 1 was that the C transfer lease deeds were signed pursuant to the requirement of Rule 9(iv) of the 1959 Rules, which necessitates a sign off by the State Government for transfer of land from one company to another, when the entity that possessed the lease is declared a sick company. Rule 9 in its entirety has been reproduced in para 6 of this . D 57. We are, once again, unmoved by this submission. If the 1959 Rules were not even applicable to begin with, there would have been no need to comply with Rule 9(iv) at all. Rather, the very fact that compliance with this provision was necessary, is sufficient indication that Respondent No. 1 was fully aware that the State Government had ownership, title, and control of LIA, Kota. E 58. Having held so, there is no alternative but to conclude that the relationship of lessor and lessee between State and Respondent No. 1 has been validly subsisting at all times and RIICO was never authorised either by Government dated 18.09.1979 or under Rules 11A and 12 of the 1959 Rules, to by-pass the State Government and assume the F self-styled role of the lessor in respect of LIA, Kota. Since, the 1967 and 2007 lease deeds in favour of JKSL and Respondent No. 1, respectively, were executed by the State Government in terms of Rule 2 of the 1959 Rules, RIICO had no authority whatsoever to permit Respondent No. 1 to change the land use or allow for the sub-division of plot without the prior approval of the State Government, which is the G sole competent authority to accord such permission in exercise of its power under Rule 8 of the 1959 Rules. The contrary view taken by the High Court is plainly erroneous in law and is based on a misconstruction of the provisions of 1959 Rules read with the binding bilateral contracts between the parties. H 288 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A 59. Not that we are dependent in any manner upon the understanding of the Government dated 18.09.1979 or Rules 8, 9, 11A and 12 of the 1959 Rules, by the State Government or RIICO. Irrespective of their inconsistent stand taken before different forums with respect to the status of RIICO qua LIA, Kota, we have drawn our conclusion primarily on the basis of plain reading of the said Government B and the 1959 Rules.
