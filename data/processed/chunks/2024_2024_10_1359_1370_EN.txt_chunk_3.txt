Additionally, the learned counsel submitted that the decision in Chiranji Lal (D) by LRs. v. Hari Das (D) by LRs.7 relied on by the High Court is not applicable to the facts of the present case. 9. The learned counsel appearing for the contesting respondent, on the other hand, submitted that the final decree was passed on 09.03.1970; it was engrossed on the stamp paper on 19.11.1990; the execution petition seeking delivery of possession of the property under the decree was preferred only on 13.03.1991, which was clearly barred by limitation as per Article 136 of the Limitation Act. That apart, the predecessor of the respondents under XXI Rule 99 CPC is entitled to raise the question of limitation for the execution of the decree, which has become time-barred. Accordingly, the High Court set aside the dated 12.08.1997 passed in EA Nos.1 and 3 of 1995 and remanded the matter to the trial Court for fresh consideration, by the impugned herein, which does not call for any interference at the hands of this Court. 7 [2005] Supp. 1 SCR 359 : (2005) 10 SCC 746 1364 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 10. We have considered the rival submissions made by the learned counsel on either side and perused the records carefully and meticulously. 11. The facts narrated above are not disputed. Concededly, in the suit filed by the original plaintiff, preliminary decree was passed on 23.10.1958; final decree was passed on 09.03.1970 and it was engrossed on stamp paper on 19.11.1990; and the Execution Petition seeking delivery of possession of the suit properties, came to be filed only on 13.03.1991. It is also to be noted that in the final decree, there was no directing the parties to furnish stamp papers for the purpose of engrossing the decree. 12. Seemingly, the predecessor of the respondents claimed right, title and interest qua 78.5 cents forming part of item no.4 of the plaint schedule property, by virtue of the assignment deed dated 01.12.1964 bearing No.3669 executed by the Defendant No.10. Pursuant to the of the Executing Court, he was dispossessed from the subject property, in which, he was occupying and the possession was handed over to the plaintiff / decree holder. After repeated challenge, the applications preferred by the predecessor of the respondents seeking re-delivery of possession and damages, contending inter alia that the Execution Petition was barred by limitation, came to be allowed and the matter was remanded to the trial Court for fresh consideration, by the impugned herein. 13. It was the specific plea of the appellants that the predecessor of the respondents being a pendente lite transferee, is not entitled to file an application under XXI Rule 99 CPC and raise the question of limitation of the Execution Petition, so as to deprive the right of the appellants to enjoy the fruits of the decree. 14. On a reading of XXI Rule 99 CPC, it is lucid that where any person other than the debtor is dispossessed of immovable property by the holder of a decree for the possession of such property, or where such property has been sold in execution of a decree, by the purchaser thereof, he may make an application to the Court complaining of such dispossession.
