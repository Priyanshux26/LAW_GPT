[2024] 7 S.C.R. 2221 Army Welfare Education Society New Delhi v. Sunil Kumar Sharma & Ors. Etc. 47. In Satimbla Sharma (supra), this Court held that the unaided private minority schools over which the Government has no administrative control because of their autonomy under Article 30(1) of the Constitution are not “State” within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. As the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution is available against the State, it cannot be claimed against unaided private minority private schools. 48. The Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Roychan Abraham v. State of U.P., AIR 2019 All 96, after taking into consideration various decisions of this Court, held as under:- “38. Even if it be assumed that an educational institution is imparting public duty, the act complained of must have direct nexus with the discharge of public duty. It is undisputedly a public law action which confers a right upon the aggrieved to invoke extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Article 226 for a prerogative writ. Individual wrongs or breach of mutual contracts without having any public element as its integral part cannot be rectified through petition under Article 226. Wherever Courts have intervened in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226, either the service conditions were regulated by statutory provisions or the employer had the status of “State” within the expansive definition under Article 12 or it was found that the action complained of has public law element.” (Emphasis supplied) 49. We may refer to and rely upon one passed by this Court in S.K. Varshney v. Principal, Our Lady of Fatima Higher Secondary School (2023) 4 SCC 539, in the Civil Appeal No. 8783-8784 of 2003 dated July 19, 2007, in which the dispute was one relating to the retirement age of a teacher working in an unaided institution. This Court, while dismissing the appeal preferred by the employee, held as under:- 2222 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “4. Both the petitions were dismissed by the learned Single Judge on the ground that no writ would lie against unaided private institutions and the writ petitions were not maintainable. 5. Aggrieved thereby, writ appeals have been filed before the Division Bench without any result. The Division Bench held [S.K. Varshney v. Our Lady of Fatima Higher Secondary School, 1999 SCC OnLine All 908] that the writ petitions are not maintainable against a private institute. Aggrieved thereby, these appeals have been filed. 6. The counsel for the appellant relied on a decision rendered by this Court in K. Krishnamacharyulu v. Sri Venkateswara Hindu College of Engg. (1997) 3 SCC 571. He particularly relied on the observation made by this Court in para 4 of the that when an element of public interest is created and the institution is catering to that element, the teacher, being the arm of the institution, is also entitled to avail of the remedy provided under Article 226. 7.
