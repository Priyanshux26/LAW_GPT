Accordingly, we find that Impugned neither secured the ends of justice nor prevented an abuse of process of law, thus we find that the Impugned was erroneous and contrary to principles laid down in Gian Singh (Supra). 13. With the aforesaid observations, the appeal is accordingly allowed, and the Impugned is set aside. The proceedings emanating from FIR i.e., Case No. 1288 of 2003, stand restored to the file of the Trial Court, with a direction to the Trial Court to dispose of the same expeditiously, preferably, within a period of one year, in view of the fact that the FIR pertains to the year 1999. 14. Pending application(s), if any, are disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Result of the case: Adeeba Mujahid, Hony. Associate Editor Appeal allowed. (Verified by: Liz Mathew, Sr. Adv.)
