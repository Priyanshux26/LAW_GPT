[2024] 6 S.C.R. 471 : 2024 INSC 367 Chaitra Nagammanavar v. State of Karnataka & Ors. (Civil Appeal Nos. 6772-6773 of 2023) 02 May 2024 [Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha* and Aravind Kumar, JJ.] Issue for Consideration For the selection in question, whether the Bangalore University was bound to comply with the 2001 Rules which was to be the mode/ method of selection as per its advertisement; whether respondent No. 7 was entitled to be appointed as per the 2001 Rules; whether the aforesaid advertisement issued by the University intending to follow the 2001 Rules made under the Karnataka State Civil Services Act, 1978 suffered from any illegality. Headnotes† Karnataka SCs, STs and OBCs (Reservation of Appointments etc.) Act, 1990 – ss.4(1A), 2(2), 2(3)(vi) – Karnataka State Civil Services (Unfilled Vacancies Reserved For Persons Belonging to the SC’s and ST’s) (Special Recruitment) Rules, 2001 – Karnataka State Universities Act, 2000 – ss.53, 54, 78 – Karnataka State Civil Services Act, 1978 – Filling up of backlog vacancies of SCs and STs as per the advertisement issued by the Bangalore University – Applicability of the 2001 Rules to appointments by the University governed by the Universities Act, 2000 – Appellant and respondent No.7, both ST candidates were eligible for appointment to the solitary post of Assistant Professor (English) reserved for a candidate belonging to the STs – While the appellant was higher in merit, respondent no.7 was within the age bracket of 29-40 years, and thus, a preferential candidate under the 2001 Rules which was to be the mode/ method of Selection as per the advertisement – However, the university following its own procedure appointed the appellant on the basis of merit – High Court held that respondent No.7 is entitled to be appointed as per the 2001 Rules – Correctness: Held: The controversy about filling up backlog vacancies of SCs and STs by the university came to an end with the insertion of Sec. 4(1A) of the Reservation Act, 1990 – In fact, the provocation * Author 472 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
