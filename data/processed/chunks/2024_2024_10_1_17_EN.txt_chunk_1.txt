The present appeal mounts a challenge to the and dated 30.04.2021 of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court in Criminal R.C. (MD) No.533 of 2020. By the said , the High Court has, by a cryptic , and long after final arguments had been concluded on 19.10.2019 in the trial court, ed further investigation in the matter. The aggrieved accused is before this Court with a grievance that the direction was not justified in law particularly when already an attempt by the wife of the deceased to summon certain witnesses under Section 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (Cr.P.C.) had been rebuffed by the Trial Court and the High Court as early as in December 2019. 3.
