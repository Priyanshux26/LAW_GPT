Balakrishna Mudaliar v. M. Satyanarayana Rao [(1993) 2 SCC 740]. Considering the F provisions of Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 a Bench of two learned Judges of this Court speaking through Kasliwal, J., endorsed (in para 10 of the SCC) the statement of law flowing from the decision of Sakalaguna Nayudu [Sakalaguna Nayudu v. Chinna Munuswami Nayakar, AIR 1928 PC 174 : 55 IA 243 : 32 CWN 850] as G well as the decision of Beaumont, C.J., speaking for the Bombay High Court in the case of Vishweshwar Narsabhatta Gaddada v. Durgappa Irappa Bhatkar [AIR 1940 Bom 339 : 42 Bom LR 653 : ILR 1940 Bom 674] . The statement of law 8 (1997) 7 SCC 452 H INDIRA DEVI v. VEENA GUPTA & ORS. 383 [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] which got imprimatur of this Court in para 9 of the Report runs A as follows: ‘The Privy Council in Sakalaguna Nayudu v. Chinna Munuswami Nayakar [Sakalaguna Nayudu v. Chinna Munuswami Nayakar, AIR 1928 PC 174 : 55 IA 243 : 32 CWN 850] has held that the benefit of a contract of B repurchase which did not show that it was intended only for the benefit of the parties contracting, could be assigned and such contract is enforceable. Beaumont, C.J. in Vishweshwar Narsabhatta Gaddada v. Durgappa Irappa Bhatkar [AIR 1940 Bom 339 : 42 Bom LR 653 : C ILR 1940 Bom 674] held that both under the common law as well as under Section 23(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, an option given to repurchase the property sold would prima facie be assignable, though it might also be so worded as to show that it was to be personal to the grantee and not assignable. On the particular facts of that case, it was held D that the contract was assignable. In Sinnakaruppa Gounder v. M. Karuppuswami Gounder [AIR 1965 Mad 506 : ILR (1965) 2 Mad 20 : In our view, generally speaking, the benefits of a contract of repurchase must be assignable, unless the terms of E the contract are such as to show that the right of repurchase is personal to the vendor. In the latter case it will be for the person who pleads that the contract is not enforceable, to show that the intention of the parties thereto was that it was to be enforced only by the persons F named therein and not by the assignee. 16.From the statement of law as has been approved and followed by this Court in two decisions in Habiba Khatoon [(1997) 7 SCC 452] and T.M. Balakrishna Mudaliar [(1993) 2 SCC 740] , unless the contents of the document in question and evidence in relation G thereto are so clear to infer a prohibition against assignment or transfer, the right of repurchase has to be held to be assignable or transferable and cannot be treated as personal to the contracting parties. 17.
