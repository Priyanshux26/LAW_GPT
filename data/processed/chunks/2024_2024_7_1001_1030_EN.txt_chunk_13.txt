Governor of Delhi (2008) 9 SCC 177 17 [2013] 4 SCR 978 : (2013) 5 SCC 427, para 13 1020 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 28. Those respondents who clandestinely got executed sale deeds with or without collusion with the Registering Authorities after the acquisition process had commenced and/or whose names were not recorded in the revenue records before issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act, are thus denuded of any cause of action under Section 5A to object against the acquisition proceedings. In the present batch, NOIDA has taken a categorical and unrebutted stand that respondents in Civil Appeals Nos. 8057, 8062, and 8064 of 2019 fall under this category. That being so, no cause of action ever accrued in favour of the respondents in these cases to invoke writ jurisdiction of the High Court. D.1.3. Respondents who have accepted the compensation 29. In addition to the plea that several landowners did not file objections and/or are subsequent purchasers, NOIDA/State have contended that some of the respondents had filed objections, but subsequently, they accepted compensation without any demur. Indeed, it is largely undisputed that Respondent No. 1 in the lead case was paid INR 1.54 cr. on 28.11.2016, and the balance amount of INR 2.61 cr. was deposited with District Judge, Gautam Budh Nagar under Section 31 of the Act on 05.12.2016. Similarly, in Civil Appeal 8050 of 2019, the landowner was paid INR 5.81 cr. on 04.07.2016. On this plank, it was strenuously urged on behalf of NOIDA/State that such of the landowners who have accepted compensation, partly or fully, without any protest, are estopped by their act and conduct from pursuing their objections under Section 5A. Secondly, possession of the acquired properties having been taken through the possession letters dated 20.06.2016, and the acquisition process being complete in all respect, the issue of procedural lapses under Section 5A has been rendered infructuous. 30. As regard to the question whether the landowners can still pursue their claims under Section 5A, we are of the considered opinion that NOIDA or the State can draw no milage out of the fact that possession of the acquired land had since been taken. We say so for the reason that the landowners cannot forcibly resist the delivery of possession to the beneficiary, namely, NOIDA. Such a state action cannot impinge upon their legal right to challenge the acquisition for non- compliance of the procedure prescribed under Section 5A. However, [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1021 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. Darshan Lal Bohra & Ors. if a landowner receives compensation volitionally subsequent to filing of the objections under Section 5A and does not preserve the right to pursue such objections, it may constitute a valid ground to implied consent to the acquisition.
