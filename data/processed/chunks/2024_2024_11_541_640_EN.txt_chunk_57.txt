In State of M.P. v. Narmada Bachao Andolan,57 this Court reiterated: “67. Thus, “per incuriam” are those decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some statutory provision or authority binding on the W.P. (C)Nos.7785, 7851, court concerned, or a statement of law caused by inadvertence or conclusion that has been arrived at without application of mind or proceeded without any reason so that in such a case some part of the decision or some step in the 56 [2004] Suppl. 1 SCR 444 : (2004) 13 SCC 217 57 [2011] 11 SCR 678 : (2011) 7 SCC 639 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 629 M/s Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rambha Devi & Ors. reasoning on which it is based, is found, on that account to be demonstrably wrong.” 107. Subsequently, in Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. v. Jindal Exports Ltd.58 this Court observed: “A prior decision of the Supreme Court on identical facts and law binds the Court on the same points of law in a later case. In exceptional instances, where by obvious inadvertence or oversight a fails to notice a plain statutory provision or obligatory authority running counter to the reasoning and result reached, the principle of per incuriam may apply. Unless it is a glaring case of obtrusive omission, it is not desirable to depend on the principle of ‘per incuriam’. It has to be shown that some part of the decision was based on a reasoning which was demonstrably wrong, for applying the principle of per incuriam.” [emphasis supplied] 108. In State of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer,59 the legal dilemma was noted as under: “10. … Easy course of saying that earlier decision was rendered per incuriam is not permissible and the matter will have to be resolved only in two ways — either to follow the earlier decision or refer the matter to a larger Bench to examine the issue, in case it is felt that earlier decision is not correct on merits.” 109. In Sundeep Kumar Bafna v. State of Maharashtra,60 the Court expanded the definition of per incuriam in the Indian context and noted that: “A decision or can also be per incuriam if it is not possible to reconcile its ratio with that of a previously pronounced of a Co-equal or Larger Bench; or if the decision of a High Court is not in consonance with the 58 [2001] 3 SCR 479 : (2001) 6 SCC 356 59 (2003) 5 SCC 448 60 [2014] 4 SCR 486 : (2014) 16 SCC 623 630 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports views of this Court. It must immediately be clarified that the per incuriam rule is strictly and correctly applicable to the ratio decidendi and not to obiter dicta.” 110. In a recent decision in Shah Faesal v. Union of India,61 a five judge bench of this Court reiterated that the principle of per incuriam only applies on the ratio of the case. 111. After having examined the above decisions, when dealing with the ignorance of a statutory provision, we may bear in mind the following principles.
