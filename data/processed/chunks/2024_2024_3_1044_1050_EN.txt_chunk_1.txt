In our opinion, the impugned dated 07.02.2020 passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal2, New Delhi, which upholds the dated 27.09.2019 passed by the National Company Law Tribunal3, Mumbai Bench, Mumbai, is legally flawed and unsustainable in view of the of this Court in “Ebix Singapore Private Limited v. Committee of Creditors of Educomp Solutions Limited and Another”4. 4. This Court in Ebix Singapore Private Limited (supra), has inter alia held that the resolution applicant cannot withdraw or modify the resolution plan, after the same is approved by the Committee of Creditors. It is immaterial that post approval by the Committee of Creditors, there is consideration under Section 31(1) of the Code by the adjudicating authority for final approval. 5. The in Ebix Singapore Private Limited (supra) elaborates and sets out several reasons why the resolution applicant cannot be permitted to withdraw or modify the resolution plan after approval by the Committee of Creditors, and before an under Section 31(1) of the Code is passed. These reasons include delay, consequences of the delay and the uncertainty and complexities that would arise in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process, which are unacceptable and not contemplated in law. Even the terms of the resolution plan, will not permit withdrawal or modification in the absence of a statutory provision, that allow withdrawal or amendment in the resolution plan after approval by the Committee of Creditors.
