Shri Ramachandran submits that the CERC as well as the learned APTEL have grossly erred in granting Change in Law relief for B the shortfall in the availability of 100% coal. He submits that AP(M)L’s bid and the PPA were admittedly premised both on domestic coal and imported coal in the ratio of 70:30. As such, the relief could be granted only insofar as the shortfall in the 70% domestic coal is concerned. He submits that AP(M)L has submitted the bid on the premise that 30% of C the coal would be imported, while 70% of the coal would be procured indigenously. He submits that the effect of the s passed by the CERC and the learned APTEL is that AP(M)L has been granted benefit on the consideration that its bid was premised on 100% domestic coal.
