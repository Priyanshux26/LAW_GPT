C This application for enhancement was rejected by DGFT, which also rejected a similar application for increased capacity by the contesting respondent, Rain CII. The relevant part of the rejection , dated 22.04.2019 is extracted below: “7. The committee also observed that M/s Rain (CII) has D drawn attention to DGFT’s Office Memorandum No. 01 /93/ 180/03/AM-1 O/PC-2(A)/P-12485 dated 5th December, 2018. The Committee decided that in view of the of the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated 28.1.2019 (as detailed in para. 5 in this minutes), the above communication dated 5th December, E 2018 is infructuous. 8. In case of M/s Sanvira Industries Ltd. also, the Committee noted that the additional capacity of 1,30,000 MT was created after the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s dated 9.10.2018 as per the official record. Hence, the request for additional quantity for the new capacity was rejected by the Committee.” F 8. The decision not to increase capacity, dated 22.04.2019 was challenged before the Delhi High Court in writ proceedings, by Sanvira by way of WP(C) No 4485/2019. On 29.04.2019, at Sanvira’s request, the writ petition was adjourned to enable it to secure necessary clarification from this court. For this purpose, Sanvira filed another G application IA 73242/2019 reiterating that its capacity had been wrongly recorded as 200,000 MTPA whereas it ought to be 330,000 MTPA. It was contended in that application that: “(xiii) It is most humbly submitted that the issue that a total production capacity of 330,000 MTPA of CPC had been H 142 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A installed by the Applicant prior to dated 9.10.2018 passed by this Hon’ble Court was not ,.pleaded before this Hon ‘ble Court in the Applicant’s IA No.12291 of 2019 as such contention had earlier never been raised by the DGFT. 9. On 08.07.2019, this court rejected Sanvira’s application (I.A. B No. 73242/2019) in the following terms: “INTERLOCUTORY APPLICATION NO. 73242/2019 (APPLNS. FOR DIRECTIONS ON B/0 SANVIRA INDUSTRIES LTD.) Our is clear. No further clarification is required. C This application is disposed of.” 10. After the above , Sanvira moved its pending writ petition before the Delhi High Court (WP No. 4485/2019). The High Court noticed the of this court, rejecting Sanvira’s contentions. The respondents in the writ proceeding i.e. DGFT were required, by the D of the Delhi High Court, (dated 06.12.2019) to consider the representation of Sanvira and pass a reasoned . Sanvira’s writ petition was therefore disposed of. On 13.02.2020, the Union Ministry of Commerce by its decision, recorded in the Minutes of Meeting rejected Sanvira’s request, stating inter alia, that: E “6. [..] The Committee observed that the contention of M/s Sanvira Industries Ltd. that the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s dated 28.01.2019 merely states that outer limit for import of RPC had already been fixed and any prayer seeking enhancement of that limit cannot be entertained and that the F said made no observation, as to whether the enhanced production capacity of the existing calciners were to considered or not is baseless. The Committee was of the view that the prayer before the Hon’ble Supreme Court (as in Para 1) was “to enhance/increase the import limit of 1.4 Million MT of RPC by an additional amount of 488,000 MT per G annum for manufacturing CPC at the Applicant’s SEZ Unit and accordingly direct the DGFT and other authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, to allocate this additional RPC to the Applicant.
