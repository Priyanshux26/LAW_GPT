Allowing the appeals, the Court HELD: 1. A plain reading of the proviso to sub-section (1) F of Section 256 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 would indicate that where the Magistrate is satisfied that the personal attendance of the complainant is not necessary, he can dispense with the attendance of the complainant and proceed with the case. Such a situation may arise where complainant’s/prosecution’s G evidence has been recorded and to decide the case on merits, complainant’s presence is not necessary. [Para 10][188-A-B] 2. The trial court as well as the High Court did not take into consideration that the complainant’s cross-examination had H 183 184 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A been over in three complaint cases and the cross-examination in the above three complaint cases was adopted in other cases that remained. Both the courts below thus failed to consider whether in the facts of the case under the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 256, the court could proceed with the matter after dispensing with the attendance of the complainant. [Para 13][189- B D-E] 3. Further, if the complainant had not appeared to press the application under Section 311 of the Code, the Magistrate could have rejected the application under Section 311 of the Code and proceeded with the case on basis of the available evidence. C [Para 13][189-F] 4. The Magistrate was not justified in straight away dismissing the complaint(s) and ing acquittal of the accused on mere nonappearance of the complainant. The High Court too failed to take notice of the said aspects. Thus, the s impugned D are liable to be set aside. [Para 13][189-F-G] Associated Cement Co. Ltd. v.
