Thus, taking into account that it was a case of night occurrence, the body of the deceased was found at an open place near a temple; a named FIR was lodged not by any villager of the place where the deceased was assaulted, but by PW-9 i.e., the village Chowkidar of the neighbouring village, who admits that no eye witness had informed her; and the body was found at a distance of 300 feet from the place where the deceased was allegedly assaulted, we are of the view that this is a fi t case where the accused are entitled to the benefi t of doubt. 25. At this stage, we may observe that though the prosecution relied on seizure of lathis and clothes at the instance of the accused but these HARILAL ETC. v. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH 149 (NOW CHHATTISGARH) [MANOJ MISRA, J.] incriminating circumstances have been denied and the serologist report could not confi rm the origin of blood stains found thereon. That apart, next to the dead body of the deceased, a lathi was found. This lathi alone could have caused the injuries found on deceased’s body. Unexplained presence of the lathi is of signifi cance when it is not the case of the prosecution that the deceased had used the lathi in self-defence. For all the reasons above, we do not consider seizure of lathi and clothes from the accused as a clinching circumstance warranting conviction. 26. The appeals are accordingly allowed. The and of the High Court as well as of the Trial Court are set-aside. The appellants are acquitted of the charge for which they have been tried. The appellants are reported to have been released on bail during the pendency of this appeal. Their bail bonds are discharged. They need not surrender. In case they are not on bail, they shall be released forthwith unless wanted in any other case. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals allowed. Nidhi Jain
