The other Appeal is filed challenging the dated 02.04.2024 passed in Criminal Miscellaneous Recall Application No.3/2020, whereby the High Court had rejected the said application. 6. Vide the dated 17.05.2024, this Court had issued Notice to the Respondent nos. 1 & 2 on the application seeking condonation of delay as well as on the SLPs, making it returnable after eight weeks. The Registry vide the office report dated 29.07.2024 submitted [2024] 9 S.C.R. 779 Bhagwan Singh v. State of U.P. & Ors. that a letter dated 09.07.2024 was received from Bhagwan Singh (in vernacular language) wherein it was stated that he had not filed any SLP before this Court and the same was falsely filed in his name. It was also stated in the said office report that an email dated 29.07.2024 was received from Mr. Rishi Kumar Singh Gautam, Advocate that he was appearing on behalf of the appellant- Bhagwan Singh. 7. When the matter was listed on 30.07.2024, Mr. Nikhil Majithia, learned advocate appearing along with the AOR Mr. Rishi Kumar Singh Gautam, drew the attention of the Court to the office report dated 29.07.2024 and the letter dated 09.07.2024 received by the office from the appellant-Bhagwan Singh and submitted that the appellant was personally present in the Court and was confirming the contents of his letter dated 09.07.2024. We, therefore called for the original papers from the Registry to verify the signature of Shri Bhagwan Singh on the ‘Vakalatnama’ filed in the SLP. One Mr. R.P.S. Yadav, an Advocate who was present in the Court on the said date stated that he had an instruction to appear on behalf of Mr. Anubhav, Advocate on Record, who had signed on the ‘Vakalatnama’ identifying and attesting the signature of Bhagwan Singh as the petitioner-appellant on the Vakalatnama. Since the AOR Mr. Anubhav was not present in the Court, the matter was adjourned to the next date i.e. 31.07.2024. 8. On 31.07.2024, the AOR Mr. Anubhav, remained present before the Court. Since on 30.07.2024, the learned Advocate Mr. R.P.S. Yadav had stated that the ‘Vakalatnama’ was signed by the appellant-Bhagwan Singh in his presence, and on 31.07.2024 he had changed his version by stating that he had received the ‘Vakalatnama’ with the signature of the appellant-Bhagwan Singh from one lawyer named Mr. Karan Singh practicing in the Allahabad High Court, the Court had directed the Registry to issue notice to the said Advocate Mr. Karan Singh for remaining present before the Court on 09.08.2024.
