Certain other reasons based on the provisions of Section 90 and 110 of the Evidence Act, were also assailed for not acting upon the registration copy of Ext.A1. 28. In the aforesaid context it is relevant to note that the sons of Vellaiya Thevar, named above, sold the property having an extent of 2 acres and 61 cents comprised in Survey No. 845/1 of Thimmarasanayakanur Village to Puliyankaladi in the circumstances specifi cally mentioned thereunder, as per registered sale deed No. 1209/ 1928 dated 27.08.1928. It is nobody’s case that the siblings of Vellaiya Thevar challenged Ext.A1 in any court of law till 15.07.1963, the day on which Puliyankuladi as per Ext.A5 sale deed No.1759/1963 of SRO Andipatti sold it to appellant/plaintiff . Add to it, its execution is not in dispute, as noted earlier. Evidently, what was sold under Ext. A5 registered sale deed by Puliyankaladi to the appellant/plaintiff is the same property comprised in Survey No.845/1 of Thimmanayakanur village of Madurai District having an extent of 2 acres and 61 cents as disclosed under the said sale deed. In short, what is discernible from the materials on record is that both Exts.A1 and A5 sale deeds were not subjected to any kind of challenge till today. At any rate, no document revealing successful challenge against those registered documents are brought on record by the respondent- defendant. 29. Having regard to all the aforesaid circumstances and in the light of the various provisions of the Evidence Act mentioned hereinbefore we will fi rstly consider the question whether the appellant/plaintiff had succeeded in 540 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. proving the contents of Ext.A1. Going by Section 65(e) when the original of a document is a public document within the meaning of Section 74, secondary evidence relating its original viz., as to its existence, condition or contents may be given by producing its certifi ed copy. Ext.A1, indisputably is the certifi ed copy of sale deed No. 1209/1928 dated 27.08.1928 of SRO Andipatti. In terms of Section 74(2) of the Evidence Act, its original falls within the defi nition of public document and there is no case that it is not certifi ed in the manner provided under the Evidence Act. As noticed hereinbefore, the sole objection is that what was produced as Ext.A1 is only a certifi ed copy of the sale deed and its original was not produced in evidence. The hollowness and unsustainability of the said objection would be revealed on application of the relevant provisions under the Evidence Act and the Registration Act, 1908. It is in this regard that Section 77 and 79 of the Evidence Act, as extracted earlier, assume relevance. Section 77 provides for the production of certifi ed copy of a public document as secondary evidence in proof of contents of its original. Section 79 is the provision for presumption as to the genuineness of certifi ed copies provided the existence of a law declaring certifi ed copy of a document of such nature to be admissible as evidence.
