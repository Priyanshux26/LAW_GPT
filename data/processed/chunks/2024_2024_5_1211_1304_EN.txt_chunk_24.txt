Such relaxation would not be available in the present case as the period of limitation for filing the appeals had expired much before the pandemic. 19 [2021] 8 SCR 167 : 2021 SCC Online SC 610, para 29. 20 [2012] 9 SCR 311 : (2012) 10 SCC 1, para 48. 21 [2012] 1 SCR 1045 : (2012) 3 SCC 563, para 28. 22 [2020] 9 SCR 472 : (2021) 2 SCC 317, para 17. 1242 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (e) Delay cannot be condoned on the grounds of the Court frowning upon the filing of fresh SLPs as no sufficient material to substantiate such a plea has been placed on record. (f) The grounds of public interest or cause of justice cannot be invoked to condone the delay, for even if the law of limitation produces a harsh outcome, it ought to be followed. The respondents have buttressed this plea by citing Pundlik Jalam Patil v. Executive Engineer, Jalgaon Medium Project,23 in which this Court held that delay cannot be condoned solely on the ground of public interest and to do justice because third- party rights may have been created during the prolonged delay and it would be unfair for such parties if the delay is condoned and the settled position is reversed. C. Law on Condonation of Delay 7. Since the issue in this batch of appeals concerns the condonation of delay, it would be worthwhile to briefly allude to the law of limitation. The Limitation Act, 1963 (“Limitation Act”) is a statute of repose founded on considerations of public policy and expediency. The dominant objective underlying the law of limitation is that the title to property, and matters of rights in general, cannot be kept in a state of constant uncertainty, doubt or suspense. Public interest requires that finality should be put to litigation. The Limitation Act, thus, prescribes the specific points of time from which the period of limitation begins to run for the institution of actions. On expiry of such period, no action can be initiated save and except where the court condones the delay for a sufficient cause. A party who is insensible to the value of civil remedies, and who does not assert his claim with promptitude is denied the ability to enforce even an otherwise rightful claim. This position is reflected in the Latin maxim, vigilantibus et non dormientibus jura subveniunt, i.e., the law aids the vigilant and not those who sleep on their rights. 8. The Bombay High Court in Kumudini Ramdas Shah v. K.M. Mody24 aptly exposited the philosophical pillars supporting the concept of limitation: (i) the sword of prosecution ought not to be hanging over an individual for an indeterminate period; (ii) those who have been 23 [2008] 15 SCR 135 : (2008) 17 SCC 448, para 30. 24 Kumudini Ramdas Shah v. K.M. Mody & Ors., AIR 1985 Bombay 320, para 4. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1243 Delhi Development Authority v. Tejpal & Ors. lethargic in safeguarding their interests should not expect the law to come to their rescue; and (iii) a defendant ought not to suffer for lost evidence owing to the passage of time.
