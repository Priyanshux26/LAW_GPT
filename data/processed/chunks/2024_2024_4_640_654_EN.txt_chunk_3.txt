Submission on behalf of Respondent:- 15. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent, vehemently and fervently urged that the view taken by the High Court while interfering with the dated 7th April, 2022 is the only permissible and legal view in the extant facts and circumstances. He referred to the Gazette Notification dated 29th April, 2011 and urged that a Special [2024] 4 S.C.R. 645 The State of West Bengal v. Jayeeta Das Court has already been notified by the Central Government for the State of West Bengal and as such, all s passed and actions taken by the Chief Judge and the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate pertaining to the offences under the UAPA are illegal and without jurisdiction. 16. As a consequence, the High Court was justified in exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC in quashing the patently illegal dated 7th April, 2022 and all subsequent proceedings sought to be taken in furtherance thereof. He urged that the impugned dated 11th May, 2023 is just and legal and does not warrant any interference. However, on the aspect of the grant of default bail to the accused, learned counsel candidly conceded that no prayer was ever made on behalf of the accused either in the Sessions Court or the High Court seeking default bail. The plank contention advanced on behalf of the respondent was that the proceedings before the Chief Judge and the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate are vitiated because both the Courts did not have the jurisdiction to proceed under the provisions of NIA Act and UAPA in light of the fact that Special Court had already been constituted for the State of West Bengal by the Central Government vide Gazette Notification dated 29th April, 2011 which was functioning. 17. Learned counsel implored the Court to reject the instant appeal. Discussion and Conclusion: 18. For the sake of convenience, we would like to advert to the issues for determination formulated by the learned Single Judge of the High Court in the quashing petition:- "i. Whether the court of sessions was entitled to entertain an application for extension of the period of remand in terms of the proviso to Section 43D (5) of the UAPA when no special court had been notified by the State of West Bengal under Section 22(1) of the National Investigating Agency Act, 2008. ii. Whether the petitioner could have been remanded by the learned Magistrate after offences under UAPA had been added.” 19. Since the validity of the dated 7th April, 2022 is the main issue requiring adjudication in the case, we would like to reproduce the said for ready reference:- 646 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
