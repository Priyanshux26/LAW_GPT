These findings of the Arbitral Tribunal were supported by the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s9 Certificate dated 08.11.2005 and Minutes of Meeting dated 05.04.2007, based on which, all the invoices were reconciled and it was agreed that future invoices would be calculated in the same manner. C The Arbitral Tribunal found that this agreement was the basis of all the future invoices and the said invoices were both approved and paid by the Government of Goa up to March 2013 and a part of April 2013. It was also held that this issue of downrating capacity should not be reagitated having already been settled by the parties. Learned counsel would submit D that the High Court has erroneously proceeded to draw an adverse inference against the claimant owing to its failure to produce the OEM’s recommendation and has erroneously entered into the process of interpretation of the Minutes of Meeting dated 05.04.2007. Learned senior counsel, while relying on the decisions of this Court in Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. v. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.: (2022) E 1 SCC 131 and Haryana Tourism Ltd. v. Kandhari Beverages Ltd.: (2022) 3 SCC 237, has submitted that in the appeal under Section 37 of the Act, re-appreciation of evidence was not permissible at all. 9.5. In regard to the question of variable charges on 4 MW power, it has been argued that the issue before the Arbitral Tribunal was as to F whether the Government of Goa was justified in claiming credits for 4 MW in computing tariff heat rate for arriving at the fuel cost variable charges from January, 2009 to 30.08.2014. This claim was made by the Government in reference to the letters dated 02.01.2009 and 19.01.2009. It has been contented that the Arbitral Tribunal, after appreciating the G evidence including the said letters, concluded that Government of Goa was exempted from payment of only fixed cost with regard to this 4 MW power permitted to be supplied to the other consumers; and the said letter dated 19.01.2009, in no way, affected the committed power 9 ‘OEM’, for short. H 404 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A supply by the claimant to the Government. Moreover, the Government had maintained its right to revert to take the said 4 MW power in future with all the terms and conditions of PPA remaining the same; and variable charges billed to the Government for supply to them were as per PPA. According to the learned counsel, the High Court erroneously re- appreciated the letters to substitute its own view with that of the Arbitral B Tribunal. 9.6. With respect to the issue related to supply of backup power by the Government to the claimant in case of a scheduled outage (when the plant was shut between May and August, 2014), the Government claimed its entitlement to 1.25 times the approved rate of Rs. 3.78 per C unit which was agreed to in the letter dated 18.09.2014. Learned senior counsel has submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal rightly came to the finding that the rate per unit was a fixed amount since determination of average cost of energy had become irrelevant, by relying on office memorandums dated 13.08.2014 and 18.09.2014.
