b) Whether Civil Court has jurisdiction to grant injunction as Section 207 of the Tenancy Act,1955 bars jurisdiction of Civil Court in respect of agricultural land? 3 (2003)5 SCC 365 4 (1968) 3 SCR 3 662 5 (1964) 2 SCR 2 273 530 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. c) Whether plaintiff ’s suit for injunction is maintainable without seeking Declaration in a Civil Court? D. Notice requirements in land acquisition proceedings i) Constitutional right to property and procedural justice 11. This is a case of compulsory acquisition of land where the land owner has no choice in the matter. The respondent purchased the concerned land for valuable consideration and was in peaceful possession of the land. At that stage, the appellant attempted to dispossess the respondent. Acquisition of land for public purpose is permitted by law, but the acquiring authority is required to ensure adherence to the statutory regime for compulsory acquisition. Only by strict adherence to the procedure, a measure of protection is aff orded to the landowners and the interested persons, and implicit therein is fairness in the procedure. After all, one is concerned with protection of constitutional rights under Article 300A of the Constitution. 12. In the context, the recent observations of this Court in Sukh Dutt Ratra v. State of H.P6., would bear consideration where the Court traced the recognition of the right to property since the 1700s and reiterated the high threshold of legality that ought to be satisfi ed, to dispossess an individual of their property: “13. While the right to property is no longer a fundamental right [“Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978”], it is pertinent to note that at the time of dispossession of the subject land, this right was still included in Part III of the Constitution. The right against deprivation of property unless in accordance with procedure established by law, continues to be a constitutional right under Article 300-A. 14. It is the cardinal principle of the rule of law, that nobody can be deprived of liberty or property without due process, or authorisation of law. The recognition of this dates back to the 1700s to the decision of the King’s Bench in Entick v. Carrington [Entick v. Carrington, 1765 6 (2022) 7 SCC 508 URBAN IMPROVEMENT TRUST, BIKANER v. GORDHAN 531 DASS (D) THROUGH LRS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] EWHC (KB) J98 : 95 ER 807] and by this Court in Wazir Chand v. State of H.P. [Wazir Chand v. State of H.P., (1955) 1 SCR 408 : AIR 1954 SC 415] Further, in several s, this Court has repeatedly held that rather than enjoying a wider bandwidth of lenience, the State often has a higher responsibility in demonstrating that it has acted within the confi nes of legality, and therefore, not tarnished the basic principle of the rule of law. 15. When it comes to the subject of private property, this Court has upheld the high threshold of legality that must be met, to dispossess an individual of their property, and even more so when done by the State.” 13.
