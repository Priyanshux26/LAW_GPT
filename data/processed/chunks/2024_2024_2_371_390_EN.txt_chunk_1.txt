Being aggrieved by dated 10.08.2018 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh, the appellant/Chandigarh Housing Board has preferred this appeal. 3. Briefly stated, the facts pertinent to the adjudication of the present appeal are that the appellant herein, vide advertisement dated 28.06.1983, had called for applications for allotment of houses exclusively for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and a total of 35 houses in the HIG (Upper) and HIG (Lower) categories were reserved for that purpose. This advertisement was issued pursuant to Regulation 25 of the Chandigarh Housing Board (Allotment, Management and Sale of Tenements) Regulations, 1979 which makes a provision for reservation of 12.5 % of the total number of dwelling units for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. One of the conditions stipulated for the applicants was that they should be a domicile of Union Territory (U.T.) of Chandigarh or should have been a bona fide resident of U.T. of Chandigarh for a period of at least three years on the date of submission of the application. The 374 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports respondent submitted his application and the draw of lots was held on 09.09.1983. The list of successful applicants was published on 12.09.1983 wherein thirty houses were allotted. 4. Due to administrative confusion about the separate reservation for the Scheduled Tribes within the reserved dwelling units, four houses, two each in HIG(Upper) and HIG(Lower) categories were kept in abeyance out of 35 houses since there were only four applicants from the Scheduled Tribes category. A clarification was sought from the Chandigarh Administration by the appellant owing to the fact there was no Scheduled Tribe community which had been notified by the President of India with regard to U.T.
