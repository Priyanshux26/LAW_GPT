Permission was granted by the Superintendent. In terms of such permission of the Superintendent, who was the proper officer, appellant had shifted the goods to under the shed to prevent further damage of the goods. It was contended that the goods were still under the bonded warehouse and could not be said to have been cleared. In this connection, reference to and reliance was placed on Section 15 of the Customs Act. This position was clarified by Sh. Yashwant Singh Bisht in his statement recorded on 07.08.1992. The appellant, therefore, requested the authority to drop the proceedings. 14. It may be mentioned that the Central Warehousing Corporation (for short ‘the Corporation’ hereinafter) had also submitted its reply dated 19.12.1993. In the reply it was stated that an open area of 2,000 sq. meters in the premises of the appellant having fencing and a gate with locking arrangement was approved by the customs and central excise authorities as a public bonded warehouse. Appellant vide letter dated 30.08.1989 sought permission from the Superintendent, Customs and Central Excise, Range-III, Pithampur for unloading the cargo covered by Bond No.T-1592 dated 31.05.1989 outside the said warehouse on account of heavy rains, etc. It was pointed out that the trailers carrying the consignment could not enter the said warehouse because those got stuck in the soil outside the said warehouse as the soil had got sluggish due to heavy rains. The Superintendent gave permission for unloading the cargo outside the warehouse but within the factory premises on the body of the letter itself. The machinery parts had to be shifted to a shed outside the bonded warehouse but within the factory premises to protect those parts from further rusting and corrosion. 15. Commissioner by his adjudication dated 28.08.1996 did not accept the reply of the appellant and confirmed the demand and interest. It was ed as under: [2024] 3 S.C.R. 897 M/s. Bisco Limited v.

Appellant would also suffer duty of Rs.39,03,821.00 plus interest at the time of their ultimate clearance.
