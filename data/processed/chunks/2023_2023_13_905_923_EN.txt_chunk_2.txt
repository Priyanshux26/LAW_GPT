A copy of this may be given to the petitioner within 24 hours on receipt of usual charges.” 4. Taking advantage of the observations made by the High Court in its dated 3.1.1986, the original petitioner fi led objections before the Competent Authority, which were rejected, vide dated 27.03.1987, while observing that, -- (a) 5499.29 square meter of land was declared surplus on 26.11.1977; (b) the notifi cation under Section 10(1) was published on 09.1.1978; (c) the notifi cation under Section 10(3) was made on 15.01.1979, (d) the appeal of the original petitioner before the District Judge was rejected on 12.07.1979; (e) the objection with regard to jurisdiction of the Competent Authority, on the ground that land is agricultural and outside the master plan, is unsustainable because, according to the report, it fell in a residential area within the purview of the Master Plan; (f) the possession of the surplus land had already been taken. 5. The aforesaid dated 27.03.1987 was questioned before the High Court through writ petition No.9702 of 1987 wherein, on 20.08.1987, an interim was passed in the following terms: “Issue Notice. In the meantime, the petitioner shall not be dispossessed from the land declared to be surplus with him.” 6. The said writ petition remained pending for over a decade and was decided on 28.02.2001, after the Repeal Act, 1999 was notifi ed. The dated 28.02.2001 is reproduced below: “Heard the learned counsel for the parties. This petition related to the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 as repealed in 1999. In Pt. Madan Swarup Shrotiya, Public STATE OF U.P. & ANR. v. EHSAN & ANR. 909 Charitable Trust Vs. State of U.P. & others J.T. 2000(3) SC 391 it has been held by the Supreme Court that if the possession has been taken over by the State Government, then the proceedings under the Act will not abate but if the possession has not been taken then the proceeding will abate. We make it clear that the word possession means actual possession (note: some words appear to be missing here) has not been taken over the proceedings shall not abate otherwise they will abate. The petition is disposed of accordingly.” (Note: supplied) 7. In the year 2012 a third writ petition6 was fi led by the fi rst respondent claiming, inter alia, that actual possession of the surplus land was never taken; he continues to remain in possession of the land and is, therefore, entitled to a declaration that ceiling proceedings qua him stood abated by virtue of Section 4 of the Repeal Act, 1999. The cause of action for fi ling the third writ petition was that, when on 25.10.2012 the original petitioner applied for an extract of the Khatauni (i.e., record of rights) of 1414 to 1419 Fasli, he discovered that name of the State was entered in the records pursuant to a letter dated 20.05.2009. Therefore, to correct the same, the writ petition had to be fi led. 8. Refuting original petitioner’s case, on behalf of the State and the Competent Authority (i.e., the appellants herein), a counter affi davit was fi led claiming, inter-alia, that,-- (i) the original petitioner had fi led a statement under Section 6(1) of the Ceiling Act, 1976, in pursuance thereof, a draft statement proposing 5499.29 square meter of land as surplus was issued under Section 8(3) on 30.06.1977; (ii) on 26.11.1977 the Competent Authority confi rmed the draft statement; (iii) on 09.01.1978 a notifi cation under Section 10(1) was published, which was followed by publication of a notifi cation under Section 10(3) in the offi cial Gazette on 15.1.1979, thereby vesting the land in the State; (iv) on 27.02.1979 a notice dated 26.02.1979, under Section 10(5), was served on the land holder and, pursuant thereto, physical possession of the surplus land admeasuring 5499.29 square meter was taken on 08.03.1979; (v) the benefi t of the Repeal Act, 1999 is not available to the petitioner.
