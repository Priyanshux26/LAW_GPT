The obligation to pay is complete by tendering the amount under Section 31(1). The landowners who had refused to accept compensation or who sought reference for higher compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act. 366.6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act is to be treated as part of Section 24(2), not part of Section 24(1)(b). 366.7. The mode of taking possession under the 1894 Act and as contemplated under Section 24(2) is by drawing of inquest report/memorandum. Once award has been passed on taking possession under Section 16 of the 1894 Act, the land vests in State there is no divesting provided under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act, as once possession has been taken there is no lapse under Section 24(2). 366.8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are applicable in case authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for five years or more before the 2013 Act came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending with the authority concerned as [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1191 Government of NCT of Delhi & Anr. v. M/s BSK Realtors LLP & Anr. on 1-1-2014. The period of subsistence of interim s passed by court has to be excluded in the computation of five years. 366.9. Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of enforcement of the 2013 Act i.e. 1-1-2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.” 36. Soon after the decision in Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra) was pronounced, applications for recall of the in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) came to be filed. By an dated 16th July, 2020 in Pune Municipal Corporation v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki [Recall ],20 a Bench of three Hon’ble Judges allowed such applications, thereby recalling the in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra). 37. The net result of the aforesaid judicial decisions is that the in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) loses its precedential value, having been recalled, although the said decision would be binding inter partes. We are informed that applications to recall the dated 16th July, 2020 have since been filed but are yet to be considered. Be that as it may. 38. At this stage, we may advert to the factual scenario of the cases in hand. These cases can be, in a way, further categorized as pre-Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra). On the other hand, the cases which fall in Groups C, are where SLPs were dismissed in limine in the first round and/or such SLPs are pending in the second round. These cases, given the binding nature of the law laid down in Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra), are covered by that decision against the landowners.
