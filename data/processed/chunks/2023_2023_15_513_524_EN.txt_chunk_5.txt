The authorities were conscious of this fact and it is for this reason the cut off CRs of the Women Offi cers were corresponding to the male batches and not their latest CRs.” 17. Annexure R-8 to the counter affidavit filed by the Union Government contains a comparison between the cut off CRs which have NITISHA AND OTHERS v. UNION OF INDIA 521 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] been taken into reckoning for women offi cers and for male offi cers of corresponding batches. The tabulated statement indicates the position for various regiments of the Indian Army. Of them, we are concerned with the fi rst, namely, the Army Ordnance Corps (AOC). For the AOC, the tabulated statement indicates the following position: Corresponding Ser No Arm/Services Batch Cut-off -CR Wos Male Batch Cut-off -CR 1995 31 May 12 31 May 12 1996 31 May 13 31 May 13 1997 31 May 13 31 May 13 1998 31 May 14 31 May 15 1999 31 May 15 31 May 15 4. AOC 2000 31 May 16 31 May 16 2001 31 May 17 31 May 17 2002 31 May 18 31 May 18 2003 31 May 19 31 May 19 2004 31 May 20 31 May 20 2005 31 May 21 31 May 21 18. The above tabulation shows that the same cut off has been adopted for batches of the women offi cers who were considered in Special No 3 SB as for corresponding batches of male offi cers. For example, for the 1995 batch, the cut off for both the women offi cers and the corresponding male offi cers is 31 May 2012. For the succeeding batches right up to 2005, the tabulated chart shows that the same cut off has been applied. The manner in which the cut off has been applied for reckoning CRs of the women offi cers for empanelment as Colonels is arbitrary because it is both contrary to the principles which were laid down by this Court in its in Nitisha and contrary to the policy framework which has been enunciated by the Indian Army itself. 19. We are conscious of the fact that the in Nitisha deals with the grant of PC, whereas in the present case the Court is concerned with the empanelment of offi cers who are granted PC for promotion as Colonels by 522 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. selection. In that regard, the policy framework which has been set out by the letter dated 7 October 2002 which has been set out in the earlier part of this makes it abundantly clear that CRs after nine years’ reckonable service were required to be taken into consideration. Subsequently, after the Quantitative Assessment System came into existence, it was clarifi ed by the policy circular dated 17 March 2011that the consideration of CRs for various SBs will be as per the policy in vogue at the time of consideration. The policy circular dated 23 December 2017 indicates the primacy which is attributed to CRs, which carry 89 out of a total of 100 marks.
