Aggrieved by the impugned 1 of the Allahabad High Court, the appellant has approached this court with a simple question of law, as to whether the High Court erred in modifying the arbitral award to the extent of reducing the interest, from compound interest of 18% to 9% simple interest per annum. Facts 2. The dispute between the appellant and Union of India (hereafter ‘respondent-state’) arose from a contract entered into pursuant to being awarded the tender. In the course of work, certain disputes arose. On 22.04.1997, the respondent-state referred the dispute to arbitration, and the proceedings closed on 24.10.1998. The tribunal published its award on 21.01.1999 and directing the fi rst four respondents to pay 18% pendente lite and future compound interest on the award in respect of Claim Nos. 1-8. 3. The respondent-state challenged the award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereafter ‘the Act’). The district court2, dismissed the challenge on the ground that it could not sit in appeal over the award and since the respondent-state had failed to fi le any proof of the grounds alleged. Aggrieved, the respondent-state, preferred an appeal before the High Court in 2003.
