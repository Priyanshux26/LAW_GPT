On a plain reading of section 294 CrPC and its interpretation by this Court in the above s, we do not find any error in the of the Trial Court and particularly considering the facts of the present case where the defence repeatedly continued to admit the genuineness of the prosecution documents exempting them from formal proof. 6 [2009] 5 SCC 771 : (2009) 13 SCC 722 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1735 Shyam Narayan Ram v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. Etc. 22. In our opinion, the High Court fell in error. Moreover, reliance by the High Court on the case of Munna Pandey vs. State of Bihar7 was misplaced, because in that case the issue was of fair trial and not of the application of section 294 CrPC. In the case of Munna Pandey (supra), prosecution witnesses were not confronted with their statements under section 161 CrPC for purposes of contradiction and in such a situation this Court had held that if the same be put to witnesses under section 145 of the Evidence Act, 1872 it would have a bearing and, therefore, remitted the matter to the Trial Court for further examination/cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. 23. For all the reasons recorded above, we allow these appeals, set aside the impugned and of the High Court and restore the criminal appeals before the High Court to be heard and decided afresh on merits on the basis of material on record. 24. Considering the fact that the incident is of 1998, we request the High Court to make an endeavour to decide the appeals afresh on the basis of the evidence led during the trial as early as possible. 25. The private respondents in all the three appeals who stand convicted under the of the Trial Court, would surrender within six weeks before the Trial Court and it would be open for them to apply for suspension of sentence before the High Court on admissible grounds in accordance to law, which application would be considered on its own merits uninfluenced by any observations made in this . We further make it clear that the evidence has not been appreciated by us. Result of the case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Gaurav Upadhyay, Hony.
