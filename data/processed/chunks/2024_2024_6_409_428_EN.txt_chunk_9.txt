For, without a clear understanding of the said expression, the Magistrate would not be in a position to determine whether the obligation cast on the police officer has been properly complied with. In this background, the expression ‘shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate’ occurring in sub- section (3) of the Section 102 requires to be examined. 19. The meaning of the word ‘forthwith’ as used in Section 102(3) has not received judicial construction by this Court. However, this Court has examined the scope and contours of this expression as it was used under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971; Preventive Detention Act, 1950; Section 157(1) of the Cr.P.C. ; and Gujarat Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act, 1985 in the case of Sk. Salim v. State of West Bengal24, Alla China Apparao and Others v. State of Andhra Pradesh25 and Navalshankar Ishwarlal Dave v. State of Gujarat26. 20. This Court, in Rao Mahmood Ahmad Khan v. Ranbir Singh27, has held that the word ‘forthwith’ is synonymous with the word immediately, which means with all reasonable quickness. When a statute requires something to be done ‘forthwith’ or ‘immediately’ or even ‘instantly’, 24 [1975] 3 SCR 394 : (1975) 1 SCC 653 (para 10 and 11) 25 [2002] Supp. 3 SCR 175 : (2002) 8 SCC 440 (para 9) 26 [1993] 3 SCR 676 : 1993 Supp (3) SCC 754 (para 9) 27 [1995] 2 SCR 230 : 1995 Supp (4) SCC 275 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 423 Shento Varghese v. Julfikar Husen & Ors. it should probably be understood as allowing a reasonable time for doing it28. 21. The expression ‘forthwith’ has been defined in Black’s Law Dictionary, 10th Edition as under: “forthwith, adv. (14c) 1. Immediately; without delay. 2. Directly; promptly; within a reasonable time under the circumstances; with all convenient dispatch” Wharton’s Law Lexicon, 17th Edition describes ‘forthwith’ as extracted: Forthwith, When a defendant is ed to plead forthwith, he must plead within twenty four hours. When a statute or rule of Court requires an act to be done ‘forthwith’, it means that the act is to be done within a reasonable time having regard to the object of the provision and the circumstances of the case [Ex parte Lamb, (1881) 19 Ch D 169; 2 Chit. Arch. Prac., 14th Edition] 22. From the discussion made above, it would emerge that the expression ‘forthwith’ means ‘as soon as may be’, ‘with reasonable speed and expedition’, ‘with a sense of urgency’, and ‘without any unnecessary delay’. In other words, it would mean as soon as possible, judged in the context of the object sought to be achieved or accomplished. 23. We are of the considered view that the said expression must receive a reasonable construction and in giving such construction, regard must be had to the nature of the act or thing to be performed and the prevailing circumstances of the case. When it is not the mandate of the law that the act should be done within a fixed time, it would mean that the act must be done within a reasonable time.
