A for the year 2016-17 was never communicated to the petitioner even till the DPC met. Therefore, as per the law laid down by this Court in catena of decisions more particularly, as observed and held by this Court in Rukhsana Shaheen Khan (supra); Sukhdev Singh (supra) and Dev Dutt vs. Union of India and Ors, (2008) 8 SCC 725 uncommunicated adverse ACRs may be even with “Good” entry which B can be said to be adverse in the context of eligibility for promotion is not to be relied upon for consideration of promotion. Therefore, uncommunicated ACR for the year 2016-17 having the grading “Good” could not have been relied upon for consideration for promotion. C 6.5 Similarly so far as the ACR gradings for the year 2019-2020 is concerned, admittedly the same was communicated to the petitioner on 08.04.2021, just one day before the DPC met on 09.04.2021. The petitioner was having 15 days’ time to make the representation against the ACR grading for the year 2019-2020. Before the 15 days were over, D the DPC met on 09.04.2021 and considered the case of the petitioner for promotion. The submission on behalf of the High Court that the other candidates who were also communicated the ACRs for the year 2019- 2020 on 08.04.2021 submitted their representations on 09.04.2021 and therefore the petitioner also could have submitted the representation on 09.04.2021 like other candidates is concerned, it is neither here nor there. E The fact remains that the petitioner was having 15 days’ time from 08.04.2021 to make a representation. Therefore, either the DPC could have been postponed or the ACR for the year 2019-2020 ought not to have been considered and the same ought to have been treated as uncommunicated ACR. F 6.7 The sum and substance of the aforesaid discussion would be that as the ACR Grading of “Good” for the year 2016-17 was not communicated till the DPC met, the same is to be ignored and/ or be not relied upon for consideration of promotion. Similarly, the grading for the year 2019-2020 also is to be excluded and/or be not relied upon for consideration for promotion as the same was communicated on G 08.04.2021 and the petitioner was granted 15 days’ time to make representation and before the representation could be made the DPC met on 09.04.2021 and considered the case of the petitioner for promotion. 6.8 At this stage the averments made in para 23 of the counter on behalf of the High Court deserves to be noted.
