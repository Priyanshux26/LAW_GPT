[Paras 39, 40] Law relating to agency – Exclusion of servants and independent contractors: Held: ‘Agent’ denotes a relationship that is very different from that existing between a master and his servant, or between a principal and principal, or between an employer and his independent contractor – Although servants and independent contractors are parties to relationships in which one person acts for another, and thereby possesses the capacity to involve them in liability, yet the nature of the relationship and the kind of acts in question are sufficiently different to justify the exclusion of servants and independent contractors from the law relating to agency – Term ‘agent’ should be restricted to one who has the power of affecting the legal position of his principal by the making of contracts, or the disposition of the principal’s property; viz. an independent contractor who may, incidentally, also affect the legal position of his principal in other ways – This can be ascertained by referring to and examining the indicia mentioned in clauses (a) to (d) in paragraph 8 of this – It is in the restricted sense in which the term agent is used in Explanation (i) to s.194-H of the Income Tax Act, 1961. [Para 41] 1006 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Doctrine/Principles – Doctrine of presumption against doubtful penalisation: Held: The deduction of tax provisions should be programmatically and realistically construed – In case of a legal or factual doubt in a given case, the assessee can rely on the doctrine of presumption against doubtful penalisation – Whether or not the said doctrine should be applied will depend on facts and circumstances of the case, including the past practice followed by the assessee and accepted by the department – When there is apparent divergence of opinion, to avoid litigation and pitfalls associated, it may be advisable for the Central Board of Direct Taxes to clarify doubts by issuing appropriate instruction/circular after ascertaining view of the assesses and stakeholders.
