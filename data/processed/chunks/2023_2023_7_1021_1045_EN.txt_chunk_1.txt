Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – ss.3(27), 18(f), D 25(2)(a) – “property”, “asset” – CIRP was initiated against the Corporate Debtor – Interim Resolution Professional claimed that the development rights held by the Corporate Debtor formed part of its intangible assets and therefore, must be included in the Information Bulletin and protected – Held: Definition of the E expression “property” u/s.3(27) includes “every description of interest, including present or future or vested or contingent interest arising out of or incidental to property” – Since the expression “asset” in common parlance denotes “property of any kind”, the bundle of rights that the Corporate Debtor has over the property in question would constitute “asset” within the meaning of s.18(f) and F s.25(2)(a), IBC – Income Tax Act, 1961 – s.102(2). Indian Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Explanation u/s.18; s.25 – Appellants challenging the impugned s of the NCLT and NCLAT argued that by virtue of the Explanation u/s.18, the disputes between the Corporate Debtor and the third-party lessee/licensee are not G amenable to the jurisdiction of the authorities under the Code – Held: Explanation u/s.18 begins with a caveat “for the purposes of this Section” – Therefore, the exclusion of assets owned by a third- party, but in the possession of the Corporate Debtor held under contractual arrangements, from the definition of the expression “assets”, is limited to s.18 – The Explanation u/s.18 does not extend H to s.25. VICTORY IRON WORKS LTD. v. JITENDRA LOHIA & ANR. 1023 Dismissing the appeals, the Court A HELD: 1.1 Section 3(27) of the IBC defines the word “property”. But the word “asset” is not defined either in Section 3 or in Section 5 or in Section 79 of the Code, though Section 79(14) defines the expression “excluded assets”. However Section 3(37) of the Code states that words and expressions used B but not defined in this Code but defined in the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872), the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (9 of 1932), the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956), the Securities Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992), the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, C 1993 (51 of 1993), the Limited Liability 15 Partnership Act, 2008 (6 of 2009) and the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013), shall have the meanings respectively assigned to them in those Acts. The word “asset” is not defined, either in IBC or in any of the seven enactments referred to in Section 3(37) of the Code. But the word “asset” is defined in Section 102(2) of the Income Tax Act, D 1961 to include “property or right of any kind”. Though Section 102 applies as such to Chapter X-A of the Income Tax Act, the definition throws light on the fact that property or right of any kind is considered to be an asset. [Paras 19, 20 and 26][1033-E, G-H; 1034-A-B; 1038-B-C] E 1.2 A bundle of rights and interests were created in favour of the Corporate Debtor, over the immovable property in question.
