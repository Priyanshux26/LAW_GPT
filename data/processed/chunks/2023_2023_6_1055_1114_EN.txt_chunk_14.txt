The reasoning and the finding of the Inquiring Judge in his report of 12th March 2019 were in the following terms:- “38) So far as the inquiry directed to be conducted by this D Court is concerned, at the outset, the relevant provisions of law with regard to the inquiry as to juvenility has to be mentioned for reference. The provisions under the Act have been mentioned above. 39) As per section 2(35) of the Act, Juvenile means a child E below the age of 18 years. The authorities referred above, specifically referring to retrospectivity as to consideration of the application of present law to the fact of juvenility is concerned, there cannot be any dispute about it. Hence, Section 9(2) of the Act is a relevant provision on the basis of which the petitioner has filed a petition before the Hon’ble F Supreme Court of India for declaration that he was a child under the Act. The said provision is reproduced above. In the case of “Raju -vs- State of Haryana [(2019) 14 SCC 401] “ there is a reference to Rule 7 A of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules 2007. The said rule deals G with making of inquiry by the Court in the claim of juvenility. Sub-Rule 3 of Rule 12 of the said Rules has stated about the procedure to be followed for age determination. After the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 came into force, the relevant provision relating to the procedure to be followed is U/sec.9 of the Act. Similarly, section 94 of H 1076 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A the Act deals with presumption and determination of age. For ready reference, all these provisions have been reproduced above. 40) The authorities of “Surendra Kumar -vs- State of Rajasthan [(2008) SCC OnLine Raj 138]” and “Shah Nawaz B -vs- State of Uttar Pradesh and Another [(2011) 13 SCC 751]” are relevant with reference to the school record.
