11. At this stage, it would be apposite to refer to the grounds under which the exercise of the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has been held to be justified. The locus classicus on this issue is State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal 7 which considers Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre,8 and has been subsequently referred to and relied upon in Neeharika Infrastructure v. State of Maharashtra;9 and Peethambaran v. State of Kerala.10 The factors to be considered are well enumerated requiring no reiteration here. 12. In particular, the second factor enumerated in Bhajan Lal (supra) is that the FIR or any other document enclosed therewith does not disclose a cognizable offence; and the seventh factor, which stipulates that where a criminal proceeding is initiated with manifest mala fides, ulterior motives or with a view to spite, are important in the present facts. 13. As noted above, the FIR was registered under Section 406 IPC which prescribes a punishment for a criminal breach of trust. Section 405 defines the said offence and provides for the ingredients that are required to be fulfilled for the offence to be made out. 7 [1992] Supp. 3 SCR 735 : (1992) Supp. 1 335 8 [1988] 2 SCR 930 : (1988) 1 SCC 692 9 [2021] 4 SCR 1044 : (2021) 19 SCC 401 10 [2023] 4 SCR 1144 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 553 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 749 Mulakala Malleshwara Rao & Anr. v. State of Telangana & Anr. This Court in Prof. R.K. Vijayasarathy & Anr. v. Sudha Seetharam & Anr.11 identified the ingredients required for a charge under Section 406 to be justified: “13. A careful reading of Section 405 shows that the ingredients of a criminal breach of trust are as follows: 13.1. A person should have been entrusted with property, or entrusted with dominion over property; 13.2. That person should dishonestly misappropriate or convert to their own use that property, or dishonestly use or dispose of that property or wilfully suffer any other person to do so; and 13.3. That such misappropriation, conversion, use or disposal should be in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract which the person has made, touching the discharge of such trust.” 14. In view of the facts of this case, the very first ingredient itself is not made out, for there is no iota of proof on record to show that the complainant had entrusted the ‘stridhan’ of his daughter to the appellants which allegedly was illegally kept by them. That apart, the second ingredient, i.e., the dishonest misappropriation or conversion for own use, also stands unfulfilled, for there is nothing on record to substantiate that the complainant’s daughter’s former in-laws converted the ‘stridhan’ allegedly kept in their custody, for their own use, more so, when the parties in matrimony had never ever raised ‘stridhan’ as an issue either in the subsistence of the marriage or thereafter, especially during the time of settlement of all issues.
