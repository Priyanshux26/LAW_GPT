Kurian v. State of Kerala and others68 and Manohar s/o Manikrao Anchule v. State of Maharashtra and another69. 242. The power to be exercised by the Central Government under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act is for effecting C demonetization. The said power has to be exercised on the recommendation of the Central Board. As already discussed hereinabove, the RBI has a pivotal role in the matters of monetary policy and issuance of currency. The scheme mandates that before the Central Government takes a decision with regard to demonetization, it would be required to consider the recommendation of the Central Board. We find that, in the D context in which it is used, the word “recommendation” would mean a consultative process between the Central Board and the Central Government. 243. In our view, therefore, the enquiry would be limited as to whether there was an effective consultation between the Central E Government and the Central Board before the decision was taken. Reference in this respect would be made to the following observations of this Court in the case of State of Gujarat and another v. Justice R.A. Mehta (Retired) and others (supra): “25. In State of Gujarat v. Gujarat Revenue Tribunal Bar F Assn. [(2012) 10 SCC 353 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 1229 : (2013) 1 SCC (Cri) 35 : (2013) 1 SCC (L&S) 56 : JT (2012) 10 SC 422] (SCC p. 372, para 34), this Court held that the object of consultation is to render its process meaningful so that it may serve its intended purpose. Consultation requires the meeting of minds between the parties that are involved in the consultative G process on the basis of material facts and points in to arrive at a correct or at least a satisfactory solution. If a certain power can be exercised only after consultation such consultation must 68 (2001) 4 SCC 215 69 (2012) 13 SCC 14 H 120 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A be conscious, effective, meaningful and purposeful. To ensure this, each party must disclose to the other all relevant facts for due deliberation. The consultee must express his opinion only after complete consideration of the matter on the basis of all the relevant facts and quintessence. Consultation may have different meanings in different situations depending upon the nature and purpose of B the statute. (See also Union of India v.
