[2023] 13 S.C.R. 706 : 2023 INSC 882 CASE DETAILS COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX 14 v. JASJIT SINGH (Civil Appeal No. 6566 of 2023) SEPTEMBER 26, 2023 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT AND ARAVIND KUMAR, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: In search and seizure, the Assessing Offi cer was of the opinion that some documents and material “belonging to” the respondents(s) assessee, were involved – Notice was issued by the concerned jurisdictional A.Os. to the said assessees who contended that the period for which they were required to fi le returns, commenced only from the date the materials were forwarded to their A.Os. Income Tax Act, 1961 – s.153C – The Revenue urged that the date (relatable to the period for which six years returns were to be fi led by the assessee) was to be from the date when the search and seizure proceedings were conducted, in respect of the main assessee u/s. 132 – The Revenue argued that the proviso [to Section 153(c)(1)] is confi ned in its application to the question of abatement. Held: It is evident on a plain interpretation of Section 153C(1) that the Parliamentary intent to enact the proviso was to cater not merely to the question of abatement but also with regard to the date from which the six year period was to be reckoned, in respect of which the returns were to be fi led by the third party (whose premises are not searched and in respect of whom the specifi c provision under Section 153-C was enacted) – The revenue’s argument is insubstantial and without merit – It is quite plausible that without the kind of interpretation which SSP Aviation adopted, the A.O. seized of the materials - of the search party, u/s. 132 - would take his own time to forward the papers and materials belonging to the third party, to the concerned A.O – In that event if the date would virtually “relate back” as is sought to be contended by the revenue, (to the date of the seizure), the 706 COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX 14 v. JASJIT SINGH 707 prejudice caused to the third party, who would be drawn into proceedings as it were unwittingly (and in many cases have no concern with it at all), is dis-proportionate.
