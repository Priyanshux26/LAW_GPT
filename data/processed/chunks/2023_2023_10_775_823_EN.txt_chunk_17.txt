The points that the RBI urged in the counter affidavit filed before the High Court have E been reiterated, which we have noticed above. That apart, perusal of paragraphs 3-7 of the ‘Additional Affidavit’ dated 19th January, 2023 and 10-13 of the ‘Further Affidavit’ dated 30th January, 2023 of the RBI reveal reference to issuance of instructions on ‘Reservation in promotion’ under section 34 of the PwD Act, 2016 by the GoI in pursuance of the directions contained in the dated 28th September, 2021 (supra) and F further that the RBI has adopted the same for itself vide its circular dated 08th December, 2022; that considering the above instructions, in relation to the examinations conducted for Panel Year 2022 vide circular dated 8th December, 2022, 16 (sixteen) vacancies were reserved for persons with disabilities and though the last date for expression of G willingness to participate in the same was 30th September, 2022, Mr. Nair did not participate; and also that the qualification for Asst. Manager Grade ‘A’ post has undergone changes and the Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) between the RBI and the Employee’s Association has been implemented vide revised qualification criteria w.e.f. 2013. H 798 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED BY THE APPELLANTS: 34. We have noticed that in the appeals, the RBI and the GoI have each raised 3 (three) questions of law which they claim are substantial questions. In essence, the questions are common but obviously differently worded and not in the same sequence. To put the matter in B the proper perspective, the appellants essentially have sought for answers in the negative to the following questions: (i) Whether the modification made by paragraph 5 of the Office Memorandum dated 3rd December, 2013 to paragraph 14 of the Office Memorandum dated 29th December, 2005 is to be applied C retrospectively with effect from 29th December, 2005? (ii) Whether the High Court was justified in holding that the RBI has to apply reservation in promotion for persons with disabilities in respect of Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’ posts? And D (iii) Whether the High Court is justified in holding that the decision in National Confederation of Development of Disabled(supra) is applicable to the present case? ANALYSIS AND DECISION: E 35. Regard being had to the narrative of facts leading to presentation of these appeals, the rival contentions advanced at the Bar on behalf of the parties and in the light of exposition of law by this Court in the decisions referred to above in regard to rights of persons with disabilities in employment under the appropriate Government or in an establishment qua matters of promotion, we are of the considered opinion F that the aforesaid 3 (three) questions have been rendered purely academic. We may briefly give our reasons therefor. 36.The decision in Rajeev Kumar Gupta (supra) considered the legality of the impugned Office Memoranda dated 18th February, 1997 and 29th December, 2005, issued by the DoPT, denying to employees of G Prasar Bharati, having disabilities, of the statutory benefit of 3 (three) per cent reservation in identified posts falling in Groups ‘A’ and ‘B’.
