On 12.04.2004 I read in the newspaper regarding murder at Kaithal in the surrounding area in which I was changing the stepney. On 13.04.2004 in the morning, I was going to Chandigarh through Kaithal and I saw a police vehicle standing on Karnal by pass Chowk in the area of Kaithal. I saw police inspector along with 4/5 police officials and saw the same accused along with police. Then I stopped and told the police regarding occurrence on 10.04.2004. Police recorded my statement on the spot.” If the statement of PW-11 is to be accepted, which the prosecution wants us to believe, then the arrest had already taken place by 13.04.2004 and therefore the accused were seen in the presence of the police on that day. If this is true, then there is no doubt in our mind that the extra judicial confession on 17.04.2004 is false and unbelievable. The evidence of this witness that is PW-11 is strongly relied on by the prosecution. In fact, the Trial Court as well as the High Court proceeded on the basis of this witness’s statement to convict and sentence the Appellant. This is perhaps the reason why the High Court did not consider it appropriate to rely on the evidence of PW-10 and proceeded to confirm conviction and sentence on the basis of other evidence. There are some other aspects which Mr. Mullick has relied on to cast a doubt about evidence of PW-10 but we are of the opinion that the above referred factors are sufficient to reject the version of PW-10. 18. PW-11 – His evidence is relied on by the Trial Court as well as the High Court. He is admittedly a chance witness. In fact, he chances the episode twice over, first on 10.04.2004 at about 10.30 PM when he was going from Chandigarh to Hisar. His version is that at about 1.5 kilometres near Karnal bypass, his car tyre got punctured and when he was putting the stepney, he saw four people on motorcycle armed with dandas. He noticed blood stain on the deceased’s pant and also records the registration number of the motorcycle. Secondly, he again chances the police party standing with the accused on his way back to Chandigarh. He stops and gets the incidence of 10.04.2004 recorded by the Police. 19. This witness is completely unreliable. It is his own statement that he started from Chandigarh at 6 PM on 10.04.2004. The distance 314 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports between Chandigarh and the place of occurrence is about 120 kilometres and takes about 2 hours to cover the distance even by car. There is no explanation as to how he took more than four hours to reach the scene of offence. This uncertainty is compounded when he admits his ignorance about the person in whose name the car is registered. Further, upon being questioned about where he stayed in Chandigarh the night of 09.04.2004, his answer is simply that he does not remember the name of the lodge.
