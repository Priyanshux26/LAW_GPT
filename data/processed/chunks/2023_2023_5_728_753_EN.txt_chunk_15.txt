On the same day, Court granted him permission subject to making a cash deposit for part and for the balance he E had to furnish the security. Thereafter, on the 31.08.1977, he moved the Application under IX Rule 13 to set aside the ex-parte decree. He also deposited the cash on 31.08.1977. On the basis of a defect pointed in the security bond on 21.09.1977, the Court directed the appellant to supply the defect, which consisted of deficient stamp in the security bond. The appellant complied with F the said . It was in these facts, the Court took the view that the Application of the appellant was wrongly rejected on the basis that there was a legal infirmity in the bond as instead of it being stamped under the Stamp Act it was stamped with court fee of Rs.2/. G OUR FINDINGS 18. When a Decree is passed by a Court of Small Causes ex- parte, inter alia, under the proviso to Section 17 of the Act, the applicant, who files an Application to set aside the ex-parte Decree is bound to do the following: H 748 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A a. He must deposit in the Court, the amount due under the Decree; b. In the alternative, he should give security for the performance of the Decree ‘on a previous Application’ made by him in this behalf; B 19. In view of the of this Court in Kedarnath (supra), the words ‘on a previous application’ in proviso to Section 17, have been understood to be an application, which may be made along with the application under IX Rule 13 of the CPC. On 06.05.2014, on the same daythe Court ed notice to be issued fixing 19.07.2014 as the C date.The execution proceeding was stayed till 19.07.2014. It could indeed be said, that even notice being issued was permissible only after compliance with the proviso to Section 17 of the Act.The appellants had filed an Application under IX Rule 13 of the CPC and Section 17 of the Act, on the same day. If the Application under Section 17 was accompanied with a cash deposit, then, the Application under IX D Rule 13 would have been, indeed, maintainable.The controversy arises as in the Application dated 06.05.2014, filed under Section 17, the appellants sought for permission to deposit/furnish surety for a sum of Rs.50,000/- out of a total sum of Rs.98,624/-. No was passed on the said Application. On 12.05.2014, appellant moved an Application E (14C). Therein, the appellant sought to furnish security in the form of a shop room of which the Proforma Respondent in this Appeal, Shri Abhishek Dixit was the tenant, but the owner was the Municipal Corporation, Lucknow. On the said Application, the Court passed an on 24.05.2014. It reads: “ F 24.05.2014 Today application has been filed on behalf of the debtor Dr. Aarti Dikshit for taking on record surety. passed. Allowed”. G 20. The contention of the appellants appears to be that the Application dated 06.05.2014, was in as it was filed along with the Application under IX Rule 13 and it accords with the law laid down in Kedarnath (supra).
