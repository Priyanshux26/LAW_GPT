Section 10(2) of the Act clearly demonstrates the intention of the Legislature that the s under Sections 8 and 9 published under Section 10(1) were to be treated as law which was not to be questioned in any court. 21. It is true that an under Section 8 or 9 published under Section 10(1) is not part of an Act of Parliament, but its eff ect is to be the same. … 33. In the instant case the provision of Section 10(4) of the Act puts s under Sections 8 and 9 as published under Section 10(1) in the same street as a law made by Parliament itself which, as we have already said, could only be done under Article 327, and consequently the objection that the notifi cation was not to be treated as law cannot be given eff ect to.” 55. The 2006 Notifi cation, having the force of law under Article 327, is protected also by virtue of Article 329 of the Constitution, which reads as follows: “Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution (a) the validity of any law relating to the delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such constituencies, made or purporting to be made under Article 327 or Article 328, shall not be called in question in any court;” 110 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 56. Thus, in view of Article 329 of the Constitution, the Delimitation Notifi cation of 2006 cannot be called into question. Any changes to the 2006 Notifi cation, could only have been made in accordance with the Delimitation Act. The Act envisages changes/suggestions only until the publication of the fi nal notifi cation, consequent to which, the notifi cation assumes the force of law in supersession of any other law for the time being in force. In view of Article 329, it is beyond the realm of judicial review. 57. The Delimitation Act only provides for changes prior to the fi nal notifi cation. Once published, the Notifi cation cannot be amended even by the Delimitation Commission under the 2002 Act. The question is thus answered in the negative. Whether the Election Commission can Amend the 2008 to incorporate those changes The Scope of powers of the Election Commission under Article 324 of the Constitution of India 58. Article 324 vests wide-ranging powers in the Election Commission. The expressions “Superintendence, direction and control” as well as “elections” have been interpreted widely to mean the entire process of elections which comprises several stages.11The power under this Article, though plenary, is not untrammeled, but is conditioned by the provisions of the statutes governing the fi eld.12 59. In Mohinder Singh Gill v. The Chief Election Commissioner,13 a Constitution Bench of this Court in the context of the Election Commission’s power to a re-poll and cancel a poll, clarifi ed that that while the Commission has plenary powers under Article 324, this power is subject to competent legislation enacted by Parliament under Article 327 of the Constitution. The Election Commission cannot, the court held, act in a manner that is contrary to the letter of the law and it is subject to scrutiny 11 Shambhu Prasad Sharma vs Charandar Mahant, 2023 11 SCC 390.
