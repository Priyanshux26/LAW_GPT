Nuney Tayang filed Election Petition No. 01(AP) of 2019 before the Itanagar Bench of the High Court of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh, seeking a declaration that the election of Karikho Kri was void on the grounds mentioned in Sections 100(1) (b), 100(1)(d)(i) and 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (for brevity, ‘the Act of 1951’). He also sought a consequential declaration that he stood duly elected from the said constituency. 3. By and dated 17.07.2023, a learned Judge of the Itanagar Bench of the High Court allowed the election petition in part, declaring the election of Karikho Kri void under Sections 100(1) (b), 100(1)(d)(i) and 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act of 1951, but rejecting the prayer of Nuney Tayang to declare him duly elected, as he had not led any evidence to prove the allegations levelled by him against Dr. Mohesh Chai, the candidate with the second highest number of votes.
