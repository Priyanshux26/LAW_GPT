He referred to the history of the AMU in 1920 and the amendments made in 1951. 234. In response, on the same day, Mr. Anthony raised the issue how the Government had on affidavit claimed that the Article 30 would not apply to the AMU in the proceedings before the Supreme Court [purportedly in a petition challenging the Ordinance preceding the 1965 amendment]. Mr. Anthony, on 01.09.1965, made a detailed speech claiming that the right under Article 30 has two elements – 2022 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports establish and administer – which can be used disjunctively. In his opinion, establishment was not a necessary pre-condition. Mr. Anthony thereafter refers to his own understanding of history of the AMU and refers to the MAO College as the ‘nucleus’ and asserted that the 1920 Act vested administration with the minority community. 235. Mr. J. Chagla responded to this on 02.09.1965 quippingly claiming that he was ‘no longer a practicing lawyer and perhaps my law has become rather rusty. But still I know a little bit of law, particularly constitutional law. I entirely disagree with him [Mr. Anthony]’. Mr. J. Chagla stated that the AMU was neither established nor administered by the Muslim community. He stated that the AMU was created by a statute, the 1951 amendments and the presence of the AMU in Entry 63, List I of Seventh Schedule makes the same crystal clear. He further gave numerous examples of how the administration of the institution was not technically with the minority community. He again claimed that the AMU was a national institution and the sovereign legislature had the right to amend the clause. He also remarked that through history, the British ensured that the institution which was financed by Indian money, was open to all communities. 236. The sparring between the two continued on 03.09.1965 as well. Mr. Anthony clearly claimed that he equated establishment with foundation and with ‘who founded it. If the minority community founded it, then giving legislative recognition will merely be as I said and I repeat, giving legislative sanction’. Mr. J. Chagla stated that in law the Parliament cannot make a classification on the basis of religion and therefore, both the AMU and the BHU enactments were amended in 1951. Finally, on 06.09.1965, after short closing speech by Mr. J. Chagla, the amendment was passed. The 1965 Amending Act effected a notable amendment by demoting the Court from its status as the ‘supreme governing body’ of the University to a consultative body for the Visitor of the University, namely, the President of India. 237. The 1972 amendment made additions to the definition clause. Critically, it added a clause to Section 5 which provides the University with the power to promote the study of religion, civilisation and culture of India. It amended Section 17 to provide that the Chancellor shall be appointed by the Visitor in such manner as may be prescribed by the Statutes and amended Section 19 made him the principal [2024] 11 S.C.R.
