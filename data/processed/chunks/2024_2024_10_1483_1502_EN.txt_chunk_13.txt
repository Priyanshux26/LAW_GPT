(c) Is it a case of threatening the deceased with dire consequences, such as harm to his family or severe financial ruin to the extent that he believed suicide was the only way out? (d) Is it a case of making false allegations that may have damaged the reputation of the deceased & push him to commit suicide due to public humiliation & loss of dignity. 24. The aforesaid are just illustrations that could be considered as abetment under the law in the facts & circumstances of a given case. 25. In the overall view of the matter, we are convinced that putting the appellants to trial on the charge that they abetted the commission of suicide by the deceased will be nothing but abuse of process of law. In our opinion, no case worth the name against the appellants is made out. 26. In the result, this appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The impugned passed by the High Court is set aside. The proceedings of Criminal Case No 11428 of 2007 pending in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow are hereby quashed. 27. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
