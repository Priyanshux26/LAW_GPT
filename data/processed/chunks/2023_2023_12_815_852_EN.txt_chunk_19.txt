The burden would be of a comparatively lighter character. In view of Section 106 of the Evidence Act there will be a corresponding burden on the inmates of the house to give a cogent explanation as to how the crime was committed. The BALVIR SINGH v. STATE OF UTTARAKHAND 841 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] inmates of the house cannot get away by simply keeping quiet and off ering no explanation on the supposed premise that the burden to establish its case lies entirely upon the prosecution and there is no duty at all on an accused to off er any explanation. xxx xxx xxx 22.

The accused preferred an appeal against their conviction before the High Court and the State also fi led an appeal challenging the acquittal of the accused for the charge of murder.
