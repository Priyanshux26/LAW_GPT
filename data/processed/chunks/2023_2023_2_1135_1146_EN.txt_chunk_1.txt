However, that principle has no role to play in the case on hand. Tenant did not stop short at executing the partnership agreement dated 01.01.1985 (Exh.48) but went on to execute the assignment agreement dated D 15.01.1985 (Exh.49), whereby he assigned his hotel business in the leased premises to a third person and received earnest money also. The very act of execution of this document was sufficient in itself to complete the breach of the lease condition and the statutory mandate and did not require anything further.
