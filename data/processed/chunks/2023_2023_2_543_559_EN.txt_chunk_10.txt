This Court in Hemani C Malhotra v. High Court of Delhi [(2008) 7 SCC 11 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 203] has held that in recruitment process changing rules of the game during selection process or when it is over are not permissible.” 28. The aforesaid would certainly govern the issue, D therefore, the decision of the Division Bench in holding the aforesaid decision as having no application to the facts of the present case cannot be sustained. In fact, the case we are dealing with, stands on a better footing than the facts governing the aforesaid case, wherein the selection process was not completed when a decision to reduce the marks was made. The Division Bench is also not correct in not following the earlier E decisions of the Co-ordinate Bench in Prajapati Ishwarbhai Joitaram v. State of Gujarat, Letters Patent Appeal No.1350 of 2012 dated 20.03.2013, which dealt with the issue of reduction in cut-off marks to accommodate horizontal reservations. 29. Much argument has been made based upon the decision of F this Court in K. Manjusree v. State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr., (2008) 3 SCC 512 and the reference pending before the Constitution Bench in Tej Prakash Pathak v. Rajasthan High Court., (2013) 4 SCC 540. On the facts of the case, we do not think that the said issue has any bearing, as held by this Court, while dealing with a case of arbitrary change in criteria, in Ramjit Singh Kardam v. Sanjeev Kumar, (2020) G 20 SCC 209, “Was the Chairman competent to take policy decisions like “selection criteria” or “mode of selection”? 51. As per the notification extracted above it is the Commission, which “shall devise the mode of selection and fix the criteria for H SURESHKUMAR LALITKUMAR PATEL v. STATE OF 557 GUJARAT [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] selection”. The said power has to be exercised in a reasonable A and fair manner to advance the purpose and object of selection. Even if it is assumed for the sake of the argument that the Commission can change the criteria of selection from time to time, the said power has to be exercised not in an arbitrary manner. 52. We may in this context refer to the three-Judge Bench B of this Court in T.N. Computer Science B.Ed. Govt. Welfare Society (1) v. Higher Secondary School Computer Teachers Assn. [(2009) 14 SCC 517 : (2010) 1 SCC (L&S) 367] In the above case computer instructors were appointed on contract basis to various schools. The Government decided to hold a special C test by the Teacher Recruitment Board for selection of computer instructors. On 10-10-2008 the State Government took decision that minimum qualification marks would be 50%. Special recruitment test was announced as 12-10-2008. On the night of 12-10-2008 a list of candidates for appointment to the post of computer instructors based on the special recruitment test was D put on the internet. While publishing the said marks of the candidates, it was made clear that all candidates who have secured 35% marks in the test would be called for certificate verification.
