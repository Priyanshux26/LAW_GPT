It appears that the attempt of the appellant association is to grab all the posts available even those apportioned for the candidates promoted from subordinate services. In our view, the said attitude is totally unequitable. 26. In any case, any interference at this stage is likely to undo the settled position which has been prevalent almost for a period of last 18 years. As already held hereinabove, the continuation of the appellants as Assistant Engineers would not amount to encroaching upon the 75% posts apportioned for the members of the appellants’ association. We may gainfully refer to the following observations of this Court in the case of Narpat Singh and Others v. Jaipur Development Authority and Another8: “10. ….The exercise of jurisdiction conferred by Article 136 of the Constitution on this Court is discretionary. It does not confer a right to appeal on a party to litigation; it only confers a discretionary power of widest amplitude on this Court to be exercised for satisfying the demands of justice. On one hand, it is an exceptional power to be exercised sparingly, with caution and care and to remedy extraordinary situations or situations occasioning gross failure of justice; on the other hand, it is an overriding power whereunder the Court may generously step in to impart justice and remedy injustice. The facts and circumstances of this case as have already been set out do not inspire the conscience of this Court to act in the aid of the appellants. …..” 27. Following the aforesaid, we find that equity demands no interference to be warranted in the impugned in the facts and circumstances of the case. 28. In the result, the appeals are dismissed. 29. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. 8 [2002] 3 SCR 365 : (2002) 4 SCC 666 : 2002 INSC 222 560 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Civil Appeal Nos. 4372, 4890, 4891 and 5747 of 2023 30. Learned counsel for the parties agree that the writ petitions being WP No. 3617 of 2017 and 35161 of 2019 filed before the Madras High Court were decided by it without even adverting to the facts and the rival submissions and they therefore made a request for remanding the matter to the High Court for consideration afresh. 31. In the result, the appeals are allowed. The impugned s dated 3rd August 2022 in WP No. 3617 of 2017 and dated 17th March 2022 in WP No. 35161 of 2019 are quashed and set aside and the matters are remanded back to the Madras High Court for consideration afresh in accordance with law. 32. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. No costs. Headnotes prepared by: Result of the case: Niti Richhariya, Civil Appeal Nos. 4886 to 4889, 4892 Hony.
