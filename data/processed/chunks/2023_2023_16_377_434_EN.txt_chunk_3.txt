v. THE 381 CHANCELLOR KANNUR UNIVERSITY Administrative Law – Principle: Held: It is a well settled principle of administrative law that if a statute expressly confers a statutory power on a particular body or authority or imposes a statutory duty on the same, then such power must be exercised or duty performed (as the case may) by that very body or authority itself and none other – If the body or authority exercises the statutory power or performs the statutory duty acting at the behest, or on the dictate, of any other body or person, then this is regarded as an abdication of the statutory mandate and any decision taken on such basis is contrary to law and liable to be quashed – It is important to keep in mind that, in law, it matters not that the extraneous element is introduced (i.e., the advice, recommendation, approval, etc. of the person not empowered by the statute is obtained or given) in good faith or for the advancement of any goal or objection howsoever laudable or desirable – The rule of law requires that a statutory power vests in the body or authority where the statute so provides, and likewise, the discharge of the statutory duty is the responsibility of the body or authority to which it is entrusted – That body or authority cannot merely rubberstamp an action taken elsewhere or simply endorse or ratify the decision of someone else. [Para 71] Writ – Writ of Quo Warranto: Held: Quo warranto is a remedy or procedure whereby the State inquires into the legality of the claim which a party asserts to an offi ce or franchise, and to oust him from its enjoyment if the claim be not well founded, or to have the same declared forfeited and recover it, if, having once been rightfully possessed and enjoyed; it has become forfeited for mis-user or non-user – It is now well settled that a writ of quo warranto lies if any appointment to a public offi ce is made in breach of the statute or the rules – In the case on hand, this Court is not concerned with the suitability of the respondent No. 4 – The “suitability” of a candidate for appointment to a post is to be judged by the appointing authority and not by the court unless the appointment is contrary to the statutory rules/ provisions.
