186. In Natural Resources Allocation, In Re Special Reference No. 1 2of0 12,'*' a Constitution Bench of this Court referred to McDowell (supra) to observe that a law may not be struck down as arbitrary without a constitutional infirmity. Thus, it was held that a mere finding of arbitrariness was not sufficient to invalidate a legislation. The Court has to enquire whether the legislation contravened any other constitutional provision or principle. b. Beyond Shayara Bano: entrenching manifest arbitrariness in Indian jurisprudence 187. In Shayara Bano ४. Union of India,'*? a Constitution Bench of this Court set aside the practice of Talaq-e-Bidaat (Triple Talaq). Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Act 1937 was also impugned before this Court. The provision provides that the personal law of the Muslims, that is Shariat, will be applicable in matters relating to marriage, dissolution of marriage and talaq. Justice R F Nariman, speaking for the majority, held that Triple Talaq is manifestly arbitrary because it allows a Muslim man to capriciously and whimsically break a marital tie without any attempt at reconciliation to save it. Thus, Justice Nariman applied the principle of manifest arbitrariness for the purpose of testing the constitutional validity of the legislation on the touchstone of Article 14. 188. Justice Nariman traced the evolution of non-arbitrariness jurisprudence in India to observe that McDowells (supra) failed to consider two binding precedents, namely, Ajay Hasia (supra) and KR Lakshmanan (supra). This Court further observed that McDowells (supra) did not notice Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India,'% where this Court held 190 [2030 S4CR ]98 2 : (2004) 4 SCC 311 191 [2091 S2CR ]31 1 : (2012) 10 SCC 1 192 [2091 S7CR ]79 7 : (2017) 9 SCC 1 193 [1927 S8CR ]62 1 : (1978) 1 SCC 248 544 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports that substantive due process is a part of Article 21 which has to be read along with Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution. Therefore, Justice Nariman held that arbitrariness of a legislation is a facet of unreasonableness in Articles 19(2) to (6) and therefore arbitrariness can also be used as a standard to strike down legislation under Article 14. It held McDowells (Supra) to be per incuriam and bad in law. 189. Shayara Bano (supra) clarified RIn Ree Sfpecieal rencNoe. 1 of 2012 (supra) by holding that a finding of manifest arbitrariness is in itself a constitutional infirmity and, therefore, a ground for invalidating legislation for the violation of Article 14. Moreover, it was held that there is no rational distinction between subordinate legislation and plenary legislation for the purposes of Article 14. Accordingly, the test of manifest arbitrariness laid down by this Court in Indian Express Newspapers (supra) in the context of subordinate legislation was also held to be applicable to plenary legislation. In conclusion, this Court held that manifest arbitrariness “must be something done by the legislature capriciously, irrationally and/or without adequate determining principle.” It was further held that a legislation which is excessive and disproportionate would also be manifestly arbitrary.
