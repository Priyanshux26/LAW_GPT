Section 6 of the Act, 1962 117. This Court in Canon India (supra) made certain observations on the purport of Section 6 of the Act, 1962 and held that the Notification No. 40/2012 dated 02.05.2012 which empowered the DRI officers to perform functions under Section 28 was invalid. The relevant portion of the is reproduced below: “21. If it was intended that officers of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence who are officers of Central Government should be entrusted with functions of the Customs officers, it was imperative that the Central Government should have done so in exercise of its power under Section 6 of the Act. The reason why such a power is conferred on the Central Government is obvious and that is because the Central Government is the authority which appoints both the officers of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence which is set up under the Notification dated 04.12.1957 issued by the Ministry of Finance and Customs officers who, till 11.5.2002, were appointed by the Central Government.
