The attempt to by-pass the payment of statutory fee would be an unjust enrichment to the Resolution Applicant, thus, contradicting Section 34(2)(d) of the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as “SEZ Act, 2005”). 11. The Appellant even challenged the fair and liquidation valuation of the Corporate Debtor being conducted by the two valuers. It was so challenged on the ground that no physical inspection of the property [2024] 11 S.C.R. 495 Noida Special Economic Zone Authority v. Manish Agarwal & Ors. in question was carried out by the said valuers. A reference in this regard was made to Regulation 35(1)(a) of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations 2016 (hereinafter referred to as “IBBI Regulations 2016”), which required physical verification of the Corporate Debtor. 12. At the cost of reiteration, the Appellant invariably pressed over and over again assignment of only INR 50 Lakhs as against the admitted claim of INR 6,29,18,121/- (Rupees Six Crores Twenty Nine Lakhs Eighteen Thousand and One Hundred Twenty One only). 13. The learned Senior Advocate appearing for the Appellant has vehemently put forth the submissions as recorded above and has also referred to the statutory provisions before this Court. On considering the same, going through the impugned dated 14.02.2022 passed by the NCLAT and the records, we are not persuaded to take a different view. 14. As regard the fair value and liquidation value of Corporate Debtor, as derived by the valuers is concerned, this Court in Duncans Industries Ltd. v. State of U.P. and Others1 held that the question of valuation is basically a question of facts, which does not call for any interference if it is based on relevant material on record. As stated above, the average of the two closest estimates given by the valuers were taken into consideration as fair value and liquidation value respectively, which were found to be just and reasonable. This would be, keeping in view Section 35C of IBC 2016, where the powers and duties of the liquidator have been laid down. Since due process appears to have been followed no fault is found requiring interference. 15. Sections 30 and 31 of IBC 2016, which deal with the submission of the Resolution Plan has rightly been evaluated and analysed NCLAT as per the ratio laid down by this Court in Maharashtra Seamless Limited v. Padmanabhan Venkatesh and Others,2 Ghanashyam Mishra and Sons Private Limited v. Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited and Others,3 and K. Sashidhar v. Indian Overseas Bank and Others,4 reference 1 (2000) 1 SCC 633 2 [2020] 2 SCR 1157 : (2020) 11 SCC 467 3 [2021] 13 SCR 737 : (2021) 9 SCC 657 4 [2019] 3 SCR 845 : (2019) 12 SCC 150 496 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports thereof has been made by the NCLAT in extenso. Conclusion as culled out and elucidated is correct that all the dues, including statutory dues owned by the Central Government, State Government and local authority, which is not the part of the Resolution Plan shall stand extinguished and no proceedings in respect of such dues for the period prior to the date on which the Adjudicating Authority had approved the Resolution Plan could be pressed into service or continues.
