27. As already noted above, a Policy Interpretation Committee was constituted. The said committee held a meeting on 07.10.2002, chaired by the DGFT. One of the agenda items deliberated upon in the said meeting was the claim of the respondent regarding inclusion of excise duty component in the price quoted before the project authority as a case of deemed export and refund of the same through the duty drawback route. The Policy Interpretation Committee discussed the case of the respondent and opined that in case any such firms were still competitive and able to supply goods at international prices despite including the component of excise duty in the price quoted before the project authority, the deemed export benefit could not be denied to such firms. Hence, the committee decided to permit deemed export benefit even in cases where the excise duty component was factored in the pricing quoted provided other conditions of deemed export benefit were adhered to. 27.1. From a perusal of the minutes of the meeting of the Policy Interpretation Committee held on 07.10.2002, it is evident that the committee had opined to extend the deemed export benefit to those firms which included excise duty component in the tender pricing quoted before the project authority such as the respondent. There is nothing in the minutes to indicate that such benefit was being extended to the respondent as a one off case or by way of concession. 28. Based on the minutes of the Policy Interpretation Committee meeting held on 07.10.2002, DGFT issued letter dated 01.11.2002, a copy of which was marked to the respondent, superseding the previous rejection dated 21.06.2002 and allowing duty drawback to be [2024] 2 S.C.R. 105 Union of India and Ors. v. M/S. B.T. Patil and Sons Belgaum (Construction) Pvt. Ltd. paid to the respondent for materials/goods, such as, steel, cement etc., used in the civil works of Koyna Hydro Electric Project. The amount of drawback refundable to the respondent was quantified at Rs.2,05,79,740.00. In the said letter, it was, however, mentioned that grant of drawback should not be treated as a precedent. It was thereafter that cheques were issued paying the aforesaid amount of duty drawback to the respondent. At that stage, respondent submitted representations contending that there was delay in the refund of drawback and therefore, it was entitled to interest from the relevant date at the rate of fifteen percent in terms of the notification No.22/95 dated 29.05.1995 (we may mention that the respondent had placed reliance on the aforesaid notification which fixed interest at the rate of fifteen percent for delayed refund of duty under Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act). However, such representations were rejected by the DGFT on 10.07.2003 and 06.08.2003 respectfully. In the rejection letter dated 10.07.2003, respondent was informed by the office of DGFT that there was no provision for payment of interest on the deemed export duty drawback. Therefore, the request for payment of interest could not be agreed upon. 29. Learned Single Judge referred to the circular dated 05.12.2000 and observed that pursuant thereto appellants had paid the duty drawback to the respondent.
