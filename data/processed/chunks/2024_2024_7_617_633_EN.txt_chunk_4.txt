The DDA underscored those certain powers, such as summoning high-ranking officials and conducting detailed inquiries, were traditionally within the domain of Supreme Court and High Court having plenary powers. They argued that the CIC, as an administrative body, should not exercise such powers as it would blur the lines between administrative and judicial functions. However, the High Court expanded its examination beyond this specific challenge. It delved into the broader issue of the CIC’s authority under Section 12(4) of the RTI Act, ultimately questioning and declaring the Regulations framed by the CIC as ultra vires. 6. The High Court framed the following questions to determine the issues at hand: "I. Whether the Central Information Commission has the authority, under the RTI Act and the Rules made thereunder, to appoint a committee comprising individuals other than the Commission’s members to investigate the implementation of obligations imposed on a public authority, such as the DDA, by Section 4 of the RTI Act? II. Whether the Chief Information Commissioner possessed the power to enact the Central Information Commission (Management) Regulations, 2007 under Section 12(4) of the RTI Act, particularly concerning the provisions in Chapter IV, which address ‘registration, abatement, or return of appeals’?” III. Whether the Central Information Commission had the authority to mandate the appearance of the Vice-Chairman, DDA, in its proceedings?” 624 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 7. The High Court, after examining the matter at length, came to the following conclusions on the aforementioned three questions: a) Regarding the first question, the High Court concluded that the CIC does not have such power. The Court held that the CIC’s authority is confined to the provisions explicitly stated in the RTI Act, which do not include the power to delegate its inquiry responsibilities to a committee. b) On the second question, the High Court found that the CIC exceeded its jurisdiction. The Court determined that Section 12(4) of the RTI Act does not confer legislative power on the CIC to frame such Regulations, especially those that go beyond procedural management and touch upon substantive matters. c) As for the third question, the High Court concluded that such powers are reserved for a judicial authority, specifically the Supreme Court or the High Court. The Court held that the CIC does not possess the jurisdiction to summon high-ranking officials such as the Vice-Chairman of the DDA, thereby overstepping its statutory limits. 8. We have heard Learned Attorney General of India, Mr. R Venkataramani, appearing for the appellant, Mr. Nitin Mishra, learned counsel for DDA which is the Respondent No. 1 and have perused the submissions of Mr. Sarbajit Roy, Respondent No. 2. 9. The arguments of the Attorney General on behalf of the appellant are briefly summarized hereunder: I. The Central Information Commission (CIC), under the authority granted by Section 12(4) of the RTI Act, framed the Central Information Commission (Management) Regulations, 2007, to manage the affairs of the CIC effectively. Section 12(4) of the RTI Act confers upon the CIC the power of ‘general superintendence, direction, and management of the affairs of the CIC’.
