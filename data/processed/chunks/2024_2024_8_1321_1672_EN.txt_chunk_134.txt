But care must be taken to see that classification is not pushed to such an extreme point as to make the fundamental right to equality cave in and collapse (see observations in Triloki Nath Khosa v. State of J&K [(1974) 1 SCC 19 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 49 : (1974) 1 SCR 771] . Ray, C.J., in Kerala v. Thomas [(1976) 2 SCC 310, 331, 332, 333, 334 : 1976 SCC (L&S) 227, 248 249, 250, 251 : (1976) 1 SCR 906, 926-29] epitomised the position in a few passages: [SCC pp. 331, 332, 333 & 334: SCC (L&S) pp. 248, 249, 250 & 251, paras 21, 24, 27, 28, 30 & 31 “Articles 14, 15 and 16 from part of a string of constitutional guaranteed rights. These rights supplement each other. Article 16 which ensures to all citizens equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment is an incident of guarantee of equality contained in Article 14. Article 16(1) gives effect to Article 14. Both Articles 14 and 16(1) permit reasonable classification having a nexus to be the object to be achieved. * * * [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1511 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. Discrimination is the essence of classification.... Classification is, therefore, to be founded on substantial differences which distinguish persons grouped together from those left out of the groups and such differential attributes must bear a just and rational relation to the object sought to be achieved. * * * There is no denial of equality of opportunity unless the person who complains of discrimination is equally situated with the person or persons who are alleged to have been favoured. Article 16(1) does not bar a reasonable classification of employees or reasonable tests for their selection (State of Mysore v. V.P. Narasing Rao [AIR 1968 SC 349 : (1968) 1 SCR 407]). This equality of opportunity need not be confused with absolute equality.... Under Article 16(1) equality of opportunity of employment means equality as between members of the same class of employees and not equality between members of separate, independent class.... The rule of parity is the equal treatment of equals in equal circumstances. The rule of differentiation is enacting laws differentiating between different persons or things in different circumstances. The circumstances which govern one set of persons or objects may not necessarily be the same as governing another set of persons or objects so that the question of unequal treatment does not really arise between persons governed by different conditions and different sets of circumstances.... A classification in to be constitutional must rest upon distinctions that are substantial and not merely illusory. The test is whether it has a reasonable basis free from artificiality and arbitrariness embracing all and omitting none naturally falling into that category.” 1512 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The learned Chief Justice relied upon earlier decisions to substantiate this proposition. In Triloki Nath Khosa v. State of J&K [(1976) 2 SCC 310, 337 : 1976 SCC (L&S) 227, 254 : (1976) 1 SCR 906, 932] this Court had held that the State may make rules guided by realities just as the legislature “is free to recognise degrees of harm and it may confine its restrictions to those classes of cases where the need is deemed to be the clearest”.
