[Para 28] Administration of Justice – Administration of Criminal Justice – Conduct of a fair trial – Constitution of India – Articles 14, 21 – Absence of a fair trial violates fundamental rights: Held: A fair trial would include due compliance of the procedure with adequate opportunities for all the stakeholders – Such procedural safeguards and compliance are to be kept in mind by the Court, as any deviation might either impact the prosecution or the defence in a given case – A fair trial is the heart and soul of criminal jurisprudence – It is not only a statutory right, but also a human right, which would be violated when the safeguards 632 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports provided under the Statute are not followed – The absence of a fair trial would seriously impair and violate the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 – The right to fair hearing is a part of Article 21 – A trial should be a real one and, therefore, not a mere pretence – There shall never be an impression over the decision of a Court that it has predetermined and pre-judged a case even before starting a trial, or else, such a trial would become an empty formality – Principle of presumption of innocence and concept of speedy trial, discussed. [Paras 7, 9, 10] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.238, 207: Held: Section 238 mandates that while dealing with a warrant case instituted on a police report, the Magistrate shall satisfy himself that he has complied with the provisions of Section 207 – In all these cases, due compliance is to be done when the accused is produced or appears before the Magistrate – Therefore, Section 238 reiterates the bounden duty of a Magistrate and, if not done, to be complied with at the time of commencement of the trial – Such a reiteration would only reinforce a renewed emphasis on due compliance being a facet of fair play – An accused shall be put to notice on the incriminating materials leading to the charges framed against him – The obligation so imposed is not only on the supply of the relevant documents, but such compliance should be at the appropriate stage so that it does not brook any delay – The idea is to enable an accused to face the trial by thoroughly understanding the case stated against him – However, a mere non-supply of a part of the documents would not lead to the trial being vitiated, unless an accused substantiates before the Court that it has caused prejudice to him – It is ultimately for the Court to come to an appropriate conclusion by an adequate assessment of facts placed before it. [Para 16] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.465 – Rigour of, when not applicable: Held: If the Appellate Court is of the view that there is a continued non-compliance of the substantial provisions of the CrPC, 1973 then the rigour of Section 465 of the CrPC, 1973 would not apply and, in that case, an of remand would be justified – This provision is meant to uphold the decision of the trial court, even in a case where there is an apparent irregularity in procedure – If the evidence available has been duly taken note of by the Court, then such a decision cannot be reversed on account of a mere technical error – This is based on the principle that a procedural [2024] 5 S.C.R.
