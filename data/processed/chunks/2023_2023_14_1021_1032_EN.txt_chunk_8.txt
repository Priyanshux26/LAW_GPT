The High Court was therefore not justifi ed in applying the same to the facts arising herein. 17. As noted, we have indicated that the contention of the respondent in the present facts that it would amount to non-disclosure and therefore a defect of substantial character cannot be accepted and since in that circumstance it is not a case of improperly accepted nomination, it certainly has not materially aff ected the result of the election as contemplated in Section 100(1)(d)(i) (iv) of the RP Act, 1951. Further, even if the object with which this Court in Union of India vs. Association for Democratic Reforms (2002) 5 SCC 294 has required the disclosure of assets is kept in view, the facts involved herein would indicate that the allegation herein cannot be taken as non-disclosure 103 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. though it could have been open for the appellant to indicate this aspect in the affi davit but in any event, it is not a substantial defect so as to materially aff ect the result of the election in the facts and circumstances herein. 18. Therefore, for all the above-stated reasons the and dated 25.04.2023 passed by the Gauhati High Court, Itanagar Bench in Election Petition No.3 of 2019 is set aside and the Election Petition No.3 of 2019 is consequently dismissed. The appeal is accordingly allowed, however with no as to costs. 19. Pending application, any, shall also stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Divya Pandey
