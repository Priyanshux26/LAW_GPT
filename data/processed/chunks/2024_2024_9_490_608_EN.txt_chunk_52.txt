……(para 13.08 (e) of the award) 6). The tribunal accepts that delays by the Claimant in submitting its invoices, in providing the backup materials and in crediting payment to its account would be included in the times computed by the claimant between the date of the invoice and the date of payment as included in its tabulation of its invoices. However, examination of Exhibit C-21 indicates that for invoices paid before 12 November 2013, over 90%, were paid in less than 50 days from the invoice date. Whereas, for invoices paid after 12 November only about 30% were paid within 50 days. Indeed, about 25% of the invoices dated after 12 November 2013 were not paid for 100 days or longer. These percentages satisfy 564 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the tribunal that the introduction of payment by letter of credit, as it was arranged by Respondent no.1, was more onerous than could reasonably have been anticipated by the claimant when it entered into the contracts. …..(para 13.08 (g) of the award) 7). Respondent no.1 decided that the original design of the Hot well drain pump was unnecessarily large and changed the specified pump to a smaller pump on 21st November 2013. As a result, both the pump and the electric motor, which was required to drive the pump, had to be re- ed. The claimant asserts, and respondent no.1 does not deny, that the original pump and motor would have been delivered to site on or about 17th February 2014. ……..(para 13.10 (a) of the award) 8). It was agreed at the hearing in this arbitration that the actual delivery date of the motors (which arrived a few days after the pump) could be taken as on or about 7th May 2014. Thus, there was a delay of approximately 79 days in delivery. ……(para 13.10 (b) of the award). 9). On balance, the Tribunal is satisfied that the drain pump together with its motor, although a low value component, was a necessary part of the ACC unit and the decision by Respondent no. 1 to replace it at a late stage risked delaying the project. The time elapsed between the original estimated delivery date, and the assumed actual delivery date was 79 days. ……. (para 13.10 (e) of the award) 10). The tribunal finds the following facts to be significant: (i) The ACC unit could not be connected to the turbine generator flange until the turbine generator was in place to have the connection made. Thus, welding of the ACC unit to the turbine flange was dependent on both completion of the horizontal duct and pressure balancing bellows by the claimant and the installation of the turbine on behalf of Respondent no.1. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 565 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. (ii) The ACC unit could not be commissioned, nor could the PG test be conducted without a flow of turbine exhaust steam. The turbine must be operational to provide the necessary flow of exhaust steam.
