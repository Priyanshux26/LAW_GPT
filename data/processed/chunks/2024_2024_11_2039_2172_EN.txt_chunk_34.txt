(c) That, instead of remitting the amount for creation of security as already advised, the SRA was sending an email that it had “no objection with the MC lenders immediately proceeding with the security creation of the Dubai properties”. (d) It was also brought to the notice of the SRA that 11.04.2024 would be the last date for complying with the impugned of the NCLAT and that the SRA was well aware of the fact that the cost of creation of securities is Rs. 2,36,00,767 and not Rs. 76.07 lakh. This shows the SRA’s clear disinclination to execute the mortgage. It was further brought to the SRA’s notice that they had failed to comply with the Resolution Plan and the impugned of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2024.

Consequently, even in terms of the impugned of the NCLAT, there has been a total breach on the part of the SRA which only indicates that they have no inclination worth the name to implement the Resolution Plan. Consequently, in terms of Clause 9.4 of the Resolution Plan and Clause 3.13.7(iii) of the RFRP respectively, the Appellants are entitled to invoke the PBG automatically without any reference to the SRA. ii.
