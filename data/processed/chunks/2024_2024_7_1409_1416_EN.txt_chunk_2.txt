On 25.01.2017, the Registrar (Listing) submitted his report stating that the case appeared to have been disposed of on 01.03.2000 and that the matter was listed as ‘to be mentioned’ on 17.01.2017 in terms of the instructions received from the High Court. On 30.01.2017, the Court directed the suit to be listed in February, 2017. This led to the respondent filing application G.A. No.693/20172 in the suit, seeking extension of time to file Written Statement, along with a copy thereof. 6. Ejectment Suit No.34/2018 was filed by TUG Developers seeking ejectment of the appellant from the premises. 7. The High Court on 21.04.2023 asked for a report from its Registry as to how the suit was shown as disposed of to which the Registrar (Original Side) responded by submitting a report on 11.05.2023 stating that there were no details of any s available in the file prior to 17.01.2017. On 12.06.2023, the learned Single Judge dismissed G.A. No.693/2017. Contempt Case No.331/2001 was also disposed of on 13.06.2023 on a statement by the appellant that the same had become infructuous. 8. Aggrieved by the learned Single Judge’s dated 12.06.2023 supra, the respondent preferred A.P.O. No.147/2023 before the Division Bench of the High Court, which, by dated 22.03.2024 allowed the appeal. This of the Division Bench is assailed in the instant appeal. 9. By the Impugned dated 22.03.2024, the Division Bench found sufficient cause on the ground of the confusion relating to pendency of the suit as also the principle that matter is best adjudged on merits rather than being thrown out on technicalities and the aim of the Court to do substantial justice between the parties rather than disposing of the matter on technical grounds unless a party is guilty of gross negligence or whatever, as described hereinabove; took 2 For clarity, G.A. No.693/2017 was later re-numbered as G.A. No.4/2017. In the context of the suit, both refer to one and the same application. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1413 PIC Departmentals Pvt. Ltd. v. Sreeleathers Pvt. Ltd. note of Chapter XXXVIII Rule 463 of the Rules of The High Court at Calcutta (Original Side), 1914 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Rules’), and; permitted the Written Statement of the respondent to be taken on record subject to payment of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) to the appellant as costs. Resultantly, the Registry of the High Court on 15.04.2024 accepted the Written Statement of the respondent in the suit. However, though costs of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) were tendered by the respondent to the appellant, it was refused to be accepted. SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANT: 10. Learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the respondent was served with summons on 28.01.2000, yet it chose not to file any Written Statement. It was submitted that an application seeking extension of time to file Written Statement was filed only in the year 2017, which clearly deserves to be dismissed. It was further contended that the Rules do not permit condonation of delay in filing of Written Statement beyond a period of 21 days.
