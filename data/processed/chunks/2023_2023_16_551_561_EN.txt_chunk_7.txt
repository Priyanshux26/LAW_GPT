Thus, when the off ence was committed, the provisions of the FSSA were not on the statute book. Therefore, the issue of confl ict between the penal provisions under the PFA and the FSSA did not arise before this Court. That is the reason why this Court had not adverted to Section 89 of the FSSA, which deals with a situation where there is a confl ict between the provisions of the PFA and the FSSA. As noted earlier, we are dealing with a case where the alleged act of misbranding was committed when the relevant provisions of the FSSA, and in particular, Section 52 thereof, were already brought into force. Therefore, we are dealing with a situation where the act of misbranding will attract penal provisions both under the PFA and the FSSA. Thus, Section 89 of the FSSA comes into the picture which did not apply to the fact situation in the case of Hindustan Unilever Limited3. 21. In paragraph 19 of the impugned , the High Court has committed an error by holding that there is no inconsistency between the penal provisions relating to misbranding under the PFA and FSSA. Hence, in our view, the High Court ought to have quashed the proceedings of the prosecution of the appellant under Section 16 of the PFA. Accordingly, the impugned and dated 13th May 2016 is hereby set aside. The proceedings of Criminal Case No. 15830 of 2011 pending before the Special Judicial Magistrate, Indore, are hereby quashed. However, this will not prevent the authorities under the FSSA from taking recourse to the provisions of Section 52 thereof in accordance with the law. 22. The appeal is allowed on the above terms.
