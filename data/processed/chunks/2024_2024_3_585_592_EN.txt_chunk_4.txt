Unfortunately, Khasra Nos. 672 and 673 are conspicuously missing in the public notice dated 17.07.2004. No individual notices were indisputably served on the respondents for the reason that they were not recorded as tenure-holders of the subject land immediately before the issuance of a notice under Section 29 of the 1965 Act. In the absence of any public or individual notice proposing to acquire Khasra No.673, we find merit in the cause espoused on behalf of the respondents. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 591 U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad v. Chandra Shekhar And Ors. 17. Nevertheless, we are equally conscious of the fact that there is a combative title dispute between the respondents on one hand, and Chandrika and others on the other. We, therefore, decline to hold or declare the respondents to be the true tenure-holders of the subject land. All that we say is that in the absence of any public or individual notice proposing to acquire Khasra No. 673, the observations made by the High Court to the extent that the respondents have been denied an effective opportunity to submit objections to oppose the acquisition in question, appears to be correct and based upon the record. That being so, the impugned to the extent it holds that the acquisition process qua Khasra No.673 stands vitiated on account of non-compliance with the prescribed procedure, does not call for any interference. 18. Having held so, the question that falls for further consideration is as to what should be the future course of action for the appellant-Board, so that neither the public interest to utilize the subject-land for the Scheme that has been substantially developed is frustrated nor the true tenure holders are deprived of the adequate compensation for their land. It may be seen from Section 55 of the 1965 Act that the compensation for the acquired land was required to be assessed in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act 1894, which stood repealed w.e.f. 01.01.2014 by the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as “the 2013 Act”). Section 55 of the 1965 Act cannot be given effect unless it is declared by way of a deeming fiction that instead of 1894 Act which now stands repealed, the compensation shall be assessed in accordance with the provisions of the 2013 Act. We hold accordingly. Since the acquisition could not attain finality before 01.01.2014, we are of the considered opinion that the Acquiring Authority/Board are obligated to pay compensation to the ex-propriated owners, as is to be assessed in accordance with Section 24(1) of the 2013 Act. 19. Consequently, we hold that the tenure-holders/owners of Khasra No.673, which was still under the acquisition process when 2013 Act came into force, shall be entitled to be paid compensation in accordance with Section 24(1) of the 2013 Act. 20. We may hasten to add that the procedure prescribed under Chapter-II of the 2013 Act, mandates to carry out the Social Impact Assessment 592 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
