M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. proceedings were listed for hearing submissions on whether or not the should be given prospective effect. B. Submissions 2. Mr R Venkataramani, Attorney-General for India, Mr Tushar Mehta, Solicitor-General of India, Mr Harish Salve, Mr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Mr Mukul Rohatgi, and Mr Arvind Datar, senior counsel, made the following submissions: a. India Cement (supra) held the field for thirty-five years before it was overruled in MADA (supra). Demands for tax under state legislation pertaining to Entries 49 and 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule have been stayed in terms of the law laid down in India Cement (supra). The affected parties (which include public sector undertakings) have factored in the state levies which were valid and applicable at the relevant point of time and passed them on to the end consumers. If State legislatures are allowed to renew the tax demands, end consumers will ultimately bear the burden; b. After the decision in India Cement (supra), the levies collected by the States were protected because of validation legislation enacted by Parliament. If a ruling creates or renews a liability for the assesses, there is no protection against retrospective demands; c. Since 2015, entities bidding for mineral concessions have submitted their financial bids on the basis of the legal position in India Cement (supra). If MADA (supra) is given retrospective effect, it will rewrite commercial bargains underpinning the mineral auctions. This Court ordinarily does not disturb past or concluded transactions in tax matters; d. The doctrine of prospective overruling is well-established in Indian constitutional jurisprudence. MADA (supra) should be given prospective effect because it lays down new constitutional principles; and e. Where enforcement of taxing legislation was either partially or completely interdicted by judicial s, it should be directed that no new tax demand be made for the period before the in MADA (supra), that is, before 25 July 2024. 550 [2024] 8 S.C.R.
