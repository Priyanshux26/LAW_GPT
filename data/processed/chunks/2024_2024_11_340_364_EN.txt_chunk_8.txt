The liability to pay electricity charges is a statutory liability. The Act provides for its consequences. Unless therefore, the 2003 Act specifically introduced the bar of limitation as regards the liability of the consumer incurred prior to coming into force of the said Act; in our opinion, having regard to Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, the liability continues. (emphasis supplied) 12. This decision has been affirmed by a decision of three (3) Judges in K.C. Ninan (supra) and is the sheet-anchor of the argument of Ms Mathew. There, this Court affirmed the principle that liabilities which arose prior to the 2003 Act coming into force would escape the limitation period prescribed by section 56(2) of the 2003 Act: “130. Before we deal with the implication of Section 56(2) on the civil remedies available to a licensee, it is important 22 [2008] 9 SCR 752 : (2008) 13 SCC 213 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 353 The Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitran Company Limited & Ors. v. Bapuna Alcobrew Private Limited & Anr. to clarify that when the liability incurred by a consumer is prior to the period when the 2003 Act came into force, then the bar of limitation under Section 56(2) is not applicable. In Kusumam Hotels Pvt Ltd. v. Kerala State Electricity Board, this Court has held that Section 56(2) applies after the 2003 Act came into force and the bar of limitation under Section 56(2) would not apply to a liability incurred by the consumer prior to the enforcement of the Act. In terms of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, the liability incurred under the previous enactment would continue and the claim of the licensee to recover electricity would be governed by the regulatory framework which was in existence prior to the enforcement of the 2003 Act. 134. The period of limitation under Section 56(2) is relatable to the sum due under Section 56. The sum due under Section 56 relates to the sum due on account of the negligence of a person to pay for electricity. Section 56(2) provides that such sum due would not be recoverable after the period of two years from when such sum became first due. The means of recovery provided under Section 56 relate to the remedy of disconnection of electric supply. The right to recover still subsists.” (emphasis supplied) 13. As settled by this Court, section 185(5) of the 2003 Act read with section 6 of the 1897 Act would lead to the inescapable conclusion that the limitation period of two (2) years prescribed for recovery of dues under section 56 of the 2003 Act would apply to liabilities arising under the 2003 Act, and not prior to the enforcement thereof. Thus, we hold that the Division Bench manifestly erred in holding that the liability incurred by the first respondent prior to the enforcement of the 2003 Act would still be barred by the provisions of section 56(2) thereof. 14. The first question is, thus, answered against the first respondent.
