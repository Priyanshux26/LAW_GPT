He admits to have prepared some document in relation to the keys recovered from the accused however no such fact is recorded in his diary. In fact, such fact is not found recorded in the Panchnama prepared by G him. The basis for the Investigation Officer (PW-19) to have arrived at the guilt of co-accused is missing in his statement. In fact, he does not even state to have suspected co-accused of having committed any crime. The sole basis for the Investigation Officer (PW-19) to have arrested the Appellant for having H committed the crime is his extra judicial confession (Ex. P.11) PRADEEP KUMAR v. STATE OF CHHATTISGARH 685 which, apart from becoming inadmissible, is of no use as it has A not led to recovery of any new fact – be it the place of the grocery shop; prevailing tension between the accused and the deceased; recovery of the body of the deceased near the Dodki drain: All these facts were known to the police from before and as far as recovery of money and keychain is concerned we have already B discussed issue. [Para 22][692-C-H; 693-A-B] 6. In the present case, the circumstances present, taken together, do not establish conclusively only one hypothesis, that being the guilt of the accused-appellant. The presumption of innocence remains in favour of the accused unless his guilt is proven beyond all reasonable doubts against him. [Babu v. State C Kerala, (2010) 9 SCC 189]. The cherished principles or golden threads of proof beyond reasonable doubt which runs through the web of our law should not be stretched morbidly which was done by the Courts below. In the present case, this Court finds neither the chain of circumstances to have been completely D established nor the guilt of the accused alone, having committed the crime to be proven, much less beyond reasonable doubt.
