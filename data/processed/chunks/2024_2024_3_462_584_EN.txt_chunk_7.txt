471 Sita Soren v. Union of India interests of the public or if it is inconsistent with the legal philosophy of the Constitution – In cases involving the interpretation of the Constitution, this Court would do so more readily than in other branches of law because not rectifying a manifest error would be harmful to public interest and the polity. [Paras 33, 188.1] Interpretation of Constitution – Interpretation of a provision of the Constitution: Held: Court must interpret the text in a manner that does not do violence to the fabric of the Constitution. [Para 92] Interpretation of Constitution – Marginal note to the Article – Importance of: Held: With reference to Articles of the Constitution, a marginal note may be used as a tool to provide some clue as to the meaning and purpose of the Article – However, the real meaning of the Article is to be derived from the bare text of the Article – When language of the Article is plain and ambiguous, undue importance cannot be placed on the marginal note appended to it – Furthermore, marginal note to a Section in a statute does not control the meaning of the body of the Section if the language employed is clear. [Para 173] Interpretation of statutes – Principles of statutory interpretation – Illustrations appended to s. 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act – Relevance: Held: Illustrations appended to a Section are of value and relevance in construing the text of a statutory provision and they should not be readily rejected as repugnant to the Section – Illustration to the first explanation of s. 7 of the PC Act aids in construing the provision to mean that the offence of bribery crystallizes on the exchange of the bribe and does not require the actual performance of the act – Similarly, in the formulation of a legislator accepting a bribe, it does not matter whether she votes in the agreed direction or votes at all – At the point in time when the bribe is accepted, the offence of bribery is complete – Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
