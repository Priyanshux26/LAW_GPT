Though the Bench recorded, in its dated 05.10.2017, the questions that were submitted by the learned amicus curiae, the Three Member Bench did not frame any particular question, but directed the matter to be placed before the G Constitution Bench. 2. At this juncture, a Special Leave Petition (Diary) No.34629 of 2017 arising out a of the Kerala High Court came up before the same Three Member Bench. Finding that the questions raised in the said SLP were also similar, this Court passed an on 10.11.2017, H 610 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A directing the said SLP also to be tagged with Writ Petition (Criminal) No.113 of 2016. 3. Thereafter, the Constitution Bench, by an dated 24.10.2019, formulated the following five questions to be decided by this Court:- “…1) Are the grounds specified in Article 19(2) in relation to B which reasonable restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed by law, exhaustive, or can restrictions on the right to free speech be imposed on grounds not found in Article 19(2) by invoking other fundamental rights? 2) Can a fundamental right under Article 19 or 21 of the C Constitution of India be claimed other than against the ‘State’ or its instrumentalities? 3) Whether the State is under a duty to affirmatively protect the rights of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India even against a threat to the liberty of a citizen by the acts or D omissions of another citizen or private agency? 4) Can a statement made by a Minister, traceable to any affairs of State or for protecting the Government, be attributed vicariously to the Government itself, especially in view of the principle of Collective Responsibility? E 5) Whether a statement by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under Part Three of the Constitution, constitutes a violation of such constitutional rights and is actionable as ‘Constitutional Tort”? …” II. A brief backdrop F 4. Without a brief reference to the factual matrix, the questions to be answered by us may look abstract. Therefore, we shall now refer to the background facts in both these cases. 5. Writ Petition (Criminal) No.113 of 2016 was filed under Article G 32 of the Constitution praying for several reliefs including monitoring the investigation of a criminal complaint in FIR No.0838/2016 under Section 154 Cr.P.C., for the offences under Sections 395, 397 and 376-D read with the relevant provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short, ‘POCSO Act’) and for the trial of the case outside the State and also for registering a complaint against the H KAUSHAL KISHOR v.
