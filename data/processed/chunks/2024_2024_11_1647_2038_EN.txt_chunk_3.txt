[Para 136] 3.3. The third test is tracing the steps taken towards the implementation of the idea – Information on who contributed the funds for its creation, who was responsible for obtaining the land, and whether the land was donated by a member of the minority community or purchased from funds raised by the minority community for this purpose or donated by a person from some other community specifically for the establishment of a minority educational institution are elements that must be considered – Similar questions must be asked of its other assets – Other important questions are: who took the steps necessary for establishing the institution (such as obtaining the relevant permissions, constructing the buildings, and arranging other infrastructure). It is also important to note that the state may grant some land or other monetary aid during or after the establishment of the educational institution – If the land or monies were granted after the establishment, the grant would not have the effect of changing the minority character of the institution – Minority institutions are not barred from receiving aid save at the cost of their minority status – If the land or monies are granted at the time of establishment, the circumstances surrounding the establishment must be considered as a whole to determine who established the institution – The presence of a grant must 1652 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports not be automatically interpreted as leading to the erasure of a claim to minority status. [Para 137] 3.4. An educational institution is a minority educational institution if it is established by a religious or linguistic minority – It is not necessary to prove that administration vests with the minority to prove that it is a minority educational institution because the very purpose of Article 30(1) is to grant special rights on administration as a consequence of establishment – To do otherwise, would amount to converting the consequence to a pre-condition – The right to administer is guaranteed to minority educational institutions to enable them to possess sufficient autonomy to model the educational institution according to the educational values that the community wishes to emphasise – It is not necessary that the purpose can only be implemented if persons belonging to the community helm the administrative affairs – This is so particularly because a minority institution may wish to emphasise secular education. [Para 138] 3.5. The test to be adopted by the Court is whether the administrative set up of the educational institution affirms the minority character of the institution – If the administrative structure of the educational institution does not reflect its minority character or when it does not elucidate that the educational institution was established to protect and promote the interests of the minority, it may be reasonably inferred that the purpose was not to establish an educational institution for the benefit of the minority community – [Para 139] 3.6. The test of administration should be evaluated in praesenti, that is, on the date of the commencement of the Constitution – An institution to be a minority institution must satisfy the criteria of being ‘administered’ as a minority institution on the date of commencement of the Constitution, and being a minority institution on the date of formation – Even if an educational institution was established by the minority for the purposes of the community, one must assess the impact of any subsequent events that altered the character of the institution before the commencement of the Constitution – The statutory incorporation of the institution does not ipso facto amount to a surrender of the minority character of the institution – The Court must pierce the veil to identify if the [2024] 11 S.C.R.
