The Trial Court vide dated 07.04.2017 ed that the CFSL Report dated 29.11.2010 with reference to the electronic devices was inadmissible in evidence in the absence of a certifi cate under Section 65-B of the Act. Though, according to the prosecution, the original devices being already on record (as a primary evidence), there was no requirement of a certifi cate under Section 65-B of the Act. Still, as a matter of abundant caution, a certifi cate under Section 65-B of the Act was obtained and when M. Krishna (PW-189) was further examined in chief on 27.04.2017, a certifi cate under Section 65-B of the Act was sought to be produced. Objection was raised by the counsel for the accused. Vide dated 20.06.2017, the Trial Court opined that the certifi cate issued under Section 65-B of the Act produced on 27.04.2017 was not admissible in evidence. Thereafter an application was fi led in the court to allow the prosecution to recall M. Krishna (PW-189) and to produce the certifi cate under Section 65-B of the Act in evidence. The application was rejected by the Trial Court holding the same to be delayed. The of the Trial Court was upheld by the High Court. It is the aforesaid which is under challenge before this Court. 4. Mr. Aman Panwar, Additional Advocate General, appearing for the appellant-State, in his brief argument submitted that in the case in hand, which shocked the whole country as such, serial bomb blasts in Bangalore were master minded by the accused. The courts below should have considered the application in that light. What was sought to be produced by the prosecution was not something, which was created later on. Rather it was merely a certifi cate under Section 65B of the Act. The primary evidence in the form of electronic devices was already on record along with the report from CFSL. It is only because the accused raised an objection to the production of that report and not to take any chances, the prosecution fi led an application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. to resummon M. Krishna (PW-189) and produce the certifi cate under Section 65-B of the Act in evidence. There was no delay as immediately after the court rejected the 234 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. report dated 29.11.2010 of CFSL on 07.04.2017, an application was fi led on 16.12.2017 seeking to produce the certifi cate under Section 65B of the Act dated 27.04.2017. The learned courts below should have appreciated the fact that by denying the prosecution opportunity to produce the certifi cate under Section 65-B of the Act, great injustice would be caused to the appellant. In support of the arguments that a certifi cate under Section 65-B of the Act can be furnished/produced at any stage of proceedings, reliance was placed on the s of this Court in Anvar P.V. v. P.K. Basheer, (2014) 10 SCC 473 and Arjun Panditrao Khotkar v. Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal, (2020) 7 SCC 1. 5. In response, Mr. Balaji Srinivasan, learned counsel appearing for the respondents, submitted that there was no error in the s passed by the courts below.
