18.04.1961 passed u/ss.5, 11 & 11A, 1874 Act – The same was rightly held to be invalid in the revisionary and that finding was correctly held to be justified by High Court– Thus, the tenancy was lawfully subsisting on 01.04.1957, i.e., Tillers’ Day, and the tenants were entitled to exercise their right of statutory purchase of these tenanted agricultural Watan lands u/s.32 of the Tenancy Act in terms of s.8 of the Abolition Act, after the exemption afforded by s.88CA ceased to exist – That right became operational on 27.11.1964, when these Watan lands were regranted to the heirs of the original Watandar – Impugned not interfered. [Paras 20-23, 33] Maharashtra Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 – s.88(1) (a) – Explanation – Merely explained the position and was not substantive in nature – Maharashtra Hereditary Offices Act, 1874 – ss.5, 23: Held: Insertion of the ‘Explanation’ was not an amendment of the provision which would have prospective effect and not apply to the application filed on 14.06.1958 u/s.5 of the Maharashtra Hereditary Offices Act, 1874 – The ‘Explanation’ merely explained the position and was not substantive in nature – It is, therefore, deemed to [2024] 3 S.C.R. 595 Baban Balaji More (Dead) by LRs. & others v. Babaji Hari Shelar (Dead) by LRs. & others have come into operation from the date on which s.88(1) was amended in August, 1956 – Thereby, the limited applicability of the provision to certain Watan lands was clearly delineated – The ‘Explanation’ to s.88 clarified the position w.r.t Watan lands, other than those covered by s.23 of the 1874 Act, as it manifests that only Watan land assigned as remuneration to an officiator performing service u/s.23 of the 1874 Act etc. shall be deemed to be land belonging to the Government – Thus, only Watan lands covered by s.23, 1874 Act were to be treated as Government lands as per s.88(1)(a) – This is further clarified by s.88CA inserted in the year 1958, which stated that ss.32 to 32-R, 33-A, 33-B and 33-C would not apply to land held as Inam or Watan for service useful to the Government, excepting land assigned as remuneration u/s.23 of the 1874 Act etc. – Thus, only Watan lands assigned as remuneration for service u/s.23 of the 1874 Act were to be treated as Government lands and stood excluded from the provisions of the Tenancy Act – Admittedly, predecessor of the appellants was not an ‘officiator’ covered by s.23 of the 1874 Act. [Paras 19, 20] Maharashtra Revenue Patels (Abolition of Offices) Act, 1962 – s.8 proviso to – Application of existing tenancy law: Held: The proviso to s.8 indicates that for the purpose of fixing the purchase price under the provisions of the Tenancy Act so as to enable the purchase of such land by the tenant, the lease shall be deemed to have commenced from the date of regrant of the land u/ss.5, 6 or 9, as the case may be – The argument of the appellants that the tenants ought to have challenged the regrant dated 27.11.1964 is without merit – In fact, the tenants were benefited by the said regrant as the exercise of their right to purchase the land hinged upon the passing of that regrant , in terms of the proviso to s.8 – The argument to the contrary is rejected.
