Service Law – Principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’: Held: The principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ postulates that: (i) Minimum requirement of merit and suitability which is necessary for the higher post can be prescribed for the purpose of promotion – (ii) Comparative Assessment amongst the candidates is not required – (iii) Seniority of a candidate is not a determinative factor for promotion but has a predominant role – (iv) Upon fulfilling the minimum qualifications, promotions must be based on inter-se seniority. [Para 98 (I)] Service Law – Principle of the ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’: Held: The principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ postulates that: (i) Merit plays a predominant role in and seniority alone cannot be given primacy; (ii) Comparative Assessment of Merit is a crucial, though not a mandatory, factor; (iii) Only where merit is equal in all respects can inter-se seniority be considered – Meaning that a junior candidate can be promoted over the senior if the junior is more meritorious. [Para 98 (II)] Service Law – Principles of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority- cum-Merit’ – Nature of these principles: 1076 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: The principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum- Merit’ are a flexible and a fluid concept akin to broad principles within which the actual promotion policy may be formulated – They are not strict rules or requirements and by no means can supplant or take the place of statutory rules or policies that have been formulated, if any – These principles are dynamic in nature very much like a spectrum and their application and ambit depends upon the rules, the policy, the nature of the post and the requirements of service – The principles applicable to promotion such as the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ can best be described as two ends of a spectrum – They are broad categories or frameworks for promotion and do represent the actual modalities by which promotions are to take place – It is the rules and the promotion policy, along with the intention of the legislature or the selection board, as the case may be, that supplements these principles and delineates the actual modality of how promotion is to take place – Through these rules and promotion policy, the legislature or the selection body specifies the area and the parameters or the weightage which is to be given to the aspect of “Merit” and “Seniority” on the said spectrum. [Para 110] Constitution of India – Art. 235 – High Court as a custodian of the District Judiciary under Article 235 of the Constitution: Held: It is clear that when it comes to promotion of judicial officers of the District Judiciary, the control vests with the High Court under Article 235 of the Constitution – The High Court being the sole authority in this regard can clearly lay down rules and policies pertaining to promotions which includes the power to specify the criteria and parameters it deems most suitable and appropriate for the purpose of promotion and the manner in which promotion is to be made as long as it is within the contours of what has been laid down in All India Judges’ Association (3).
