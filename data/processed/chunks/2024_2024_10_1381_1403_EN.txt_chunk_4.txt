SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS: 9. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that on 29.08.2005, the Corporation had taken a decision with regard to imposition of royalty in the Meeting held with representatives of advertising agency/cies. It was agreed that advertisers would make payment of royalty to the Corporation at the rate of Re.1 per square foot per annum based on the area of the hoardings concerned. Thus, it was submitted that the issue is limited only to charging of royalty and there is no imposition of any kind of tax, as has been erroneously held by the Single Bench as also by the Division Bench. It was submitted that on 02.11.2007, the Corporation issued an Office whereby the rate of royalty was increased from Re.1 per square foot per annum to Rs.10 per square foot per annum. It was further submitted that on 18.07.2009, a Meeting was held between the Corporation (headed by the Appellant No.2) and representatives of advertisers, where there was no opposition to the proposal afore-noted. However, learned senior counsel contended that since the royalty was not being paid, in the year 2011, the Appellant No.2 recommended the imposition of penalty on the arrears due from the advertisers. 10. He further submitted that on 15.12.2010, in the General Meeting of the Corporation, it was decided that the registration of such defaulting advertising agency(ies) be cancelled, and this was followed-up by the Corporation raising demand for payment of arrears of royalty from the concerned advertisers, including Respondent No.1, in whose case it was to the tune of Rs.64,50,040/- (Rupees Sixty Four Lakhs Fifty Thousand and Forty). Learned counsel further submitted that only at this belated stage, the Respondent No.1 preferred CWJC No.5108 of 2012, wherein Office dated 02.11.2007 as well as the Demand Notice dated 11.02.2012 were assailed. 11. Learned counsel submitted that by a detailed and comprehensive , the learned Single Judge upheld the levy of charge by the 1388 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Corporation and only the demand of penalty was interfered with. It was submitted that the learned Single Judge even observed that the writ petitioners before it, including Respondent No.1, were liable to pay the amount due to the Corporation in easy instalments in intervals of four months to be fixed by the Appellant-Corporation. Thus, learned counsel contended that in conformity with the Single Bench , the Corporation raised fresh demand on Respondent No.1 under letter dated 18.07.2012 for Rs.21,98,000/- (Rupees Twenty One Lakhs Ninety Eight Thousand). However, it was submitted that the Respondent No.1 deposited only a sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand) on 21.07.2012. At this juncture, learned counsel for Respondent No.1 submitted that Respondent No.1 on 28.01.2013 had disputed the demand of Rs.21,98,000/- (Rupees Twenty One Lakhs Ninety Eight Thousand) and self-assessed the dues to be Rs.1,57,050/- (Rupees One Lakh Fifty Seven Thousand and Fifty) and after adjusting the amount already paid, calculated the payment to be made in three instalments of Rs.28,767/- (Rupees Twenty Eight Thousand Seven Hundred Sixty Seven) each, which Respondent No.1 paid on 28.01.2013, 29.05.2013 and 28.09.2013 by Draft(s).
