Awarded by the Arbitrator (Pg.56 of SLP) 460 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 19. The chart and explanations given in the chart, we believe, are an afterthought and futile fi nagle to work backwards to somehow justify the computation and award of damages. These explanations are ex facie irrational and eristic for the following reasons: (i) S.No.7 computes the net loss suff ered by BEEL as Rs.90,47,871/- as on 01.09.1993, that is for the period of 18 months. The computation ignores and does not add the period of 4 months as mentioned by BEEL in the claim statement. Further, the arbitrator had added another period of 3 months for internal administrative process and force majeure events. Thus, the date 01.09.1993 referred to in S.No.7 is incorrect and not the basis of the computation made in the award. S.No.7 fails to taken into consideration the seven-month period, which as per the award has to be added. (ii) The fi gure of Rs.90,47,871/- would have been relevant, in absence of work done and in fact payments post 01.09.1993. However, it is an accepted and admitted position that payment of Rs.2,92,07,619.13p was made on diff erent dates between 01.09.1993 till 30.03.1996 upon completion of the proportionate value of the work. Claim on account of loss of profi ts/profi tability and overheads, as has been explained above and also elucidated herein-after with reference to several s and treatise, is payable if and when there is an increase in cost of off -site and on-site overheads due to delay in completion of work post the agreed or contractual period which is caused by the employer.13 Further, loss on account of profi t earning capacity is paid when the contractor’s profi t earning capacity is aff ected due to it being retained longer in the contract in question, without corresponding 13 In this case, as noticed, the contract bars claims for compensation for losses due to enhancement/escalation of costs etc.
