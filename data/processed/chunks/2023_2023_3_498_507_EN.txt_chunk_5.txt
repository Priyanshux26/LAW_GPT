F 15. We have heard counsel for the parties and with their assistance perused the material on record. 16. It is not in dispute that the tender was originally floated by the appellants on 13th March, 1997 and the respondent was a successful bidder and submitted his offer for 27887.50 sq. meters @ Rs.725/- per G sq. meter for a total value of Rs.2,06,67,966/- which was to be paid in four instalments and after making the advance payment of Rs.15 lakhs as earnest money, the remaining four instalments were to be deposited on 31st October, 1997, 30th June, 1998, 28th October, 1999 and the last instalment by 31st October, 1999. Admittedly, the respondent deposited the amount in piecemeal and not in terms of the instalments, as agreed, H GWALIOR DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY AND ANR. v. 505 BHANU PRATAP SINGH [AJAY RASTOGI, J.] which was in terms of the conditions of the tender document and the A final instalment was deposited in reference to the auction bid by 25th August, 2005. 17. In the ordinary course of business, as the respondent has failed to deposit in terms of the tender document, the last instalment by 31st October, 1999, the auction was supposed to be cancelled and the earnest B money deserved to be forfeited. We find no reasonable justification in the present facts and circumstances as to what would be the reason for undue indulgence being shown to the respondent while extending him the benefit to deposit the instalment by 25th August, 2005 and we have our strong reservations and such exercise of power by the Authority, in C our view, is a clear abuse of discretion which is not only violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, but also smacks of an undue favour which is always to be avoided and whenever there is such a business/ commercial transaction, it is always to be examined on the commercial principles where equity has no role to play. Be that as it may, as much water has flown in the Ganges, we would not like to stretch it any further. D 18. However, the fact is that the parties sitting across the table, got the lease deed executed for 18262.89 sq. meters without demur on 29th March, 2006 and the transaction stood concluded after execution of the lease deed, which was initiated pursuant to a tender floated by the appellant on 13th March, 1997and since the lease deed was to be E compulsorily registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, it was nowhere open to be altered or amended even by the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. 19. The High Court under impugned has although passed a very lengthy , but the s on which reliance has been placed F have no semblance to the facts of the instant case and natural justice has no role to play in the given facts and circumstances, of which reference has been made. In our considered view, the passed by the High Court in issuing a mandamus to execute the lease deed in favour of the respondent for the remaining area of 9625.50 sq.
