However, the respondents failed to reply to the said notice within a period of 30 days i.e. within 23.02.2017. Therefore, the period of limitation of three years, for the purposes of a Section 11(6) petition, would begin to run from 23.02.2017 i.e., the date of failure or refusal by the other party to comply with the requirements mentioned in the notice invoking arbitration. The present petitions under Section 11(6) were filed on 09.04.2019. Even including the period during which the parties proceeded before the Bombay High Court which ultimately held that the applications before it were not maintainable i.e., 03.03.2017 to 22.02.2019, these petitions are well within the bounds of limitation. 42. The primary issue that has been canvassed by the respondents is that the substantive claims of the petitioner are ex-facie time barred and therefore, incapable of being referred to arbitration. The respondents contend that, with respect to the issue relating to the 2,00,010 equity shares, the petitioner has sought enforcement of the letter dated 22.09.2011 but has however, served a notice invoking arbitration 6 years later on 23.01.2017. Further, with respect to the 4,00,000 equity shares, it was contended that the claim can only arise upon the date of resignation i.e., 18.07.2013 and the claim would, therefore, again be time-barred. Conversely, the case of the petitioners is that the date of 15.10.2015 i.e., the date of the last legal notice sent by the respondents to the petitioner, can be considered as the date of cause of action for the purposes of limitation. In the alternative, they assert that there is no specific date or day on which it can be ascertained that the cause of action had arisen since there is a continuous breach of contract on part of the respondents. As evident from the aforesaid discussion and especially in light of the observations made in Krish Spinning (supra), this Court cannot conduct an intricate evidentiary enquiry into the question of when [2024] 12 S.C.R. 131 Aslam Ismail Khan Deshmukh v. Asap Fluids Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. the cause of action can be said to have arisen between the parties and whether the claim raised by the petitioner is time barred. This has to be strictly left for the determination by the arbitral tribunal. 43. All other submissions made by the parties regarding the entitlement of the petitioner to 4,00,000 and 2,00,010 equity shares in the respondent no.1 company are concerned with the merits of the dispute which squarely falls within the domain of the arbitral tribunal. 44. It is now well settled law that, at the stage of Section 11 application, the referral Courts need only to examine whether the arbitration agreement exists – nothing more, nothing less. This approach upholds the intention of the parties, at the time of entering into the agreement, to refer all disputes arising between themselves to arbitration. However, some parties might take undue advantage of such a limited scope of judicial interference of the referral courts and force other parties to the agreement into participating in a time-consuming and costly arbitration process.
