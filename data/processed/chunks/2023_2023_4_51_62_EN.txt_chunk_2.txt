Challenging a common passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka, setting aside a penalty of dismissal from C service imposed upon the respondent herein, who happened to be a Civil Judge (Junior Division), the Registrar General of the High Court of Karnataka has come up with the above appeals. 3. We have heard Mr. Basava Prabhu S. Patil, learned senior counsel appearing the appellant-High Court and Ms. Anitha Shenoy, D learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent. 4. The respondent was appointed as a Civil Judge (Junior Division) vide a notification dated 31.01.1995. 5. On certain allegations of gross misconduct, the respondent was placed under suspension by an dated 25.01.2005, followed by the E initiation of disciplinary proceedings, with the issue of Charge Memos dated 23.03.2005 in DI No.2/2005; DI No.3/2005; DI No.4/2005 and DI No.5/2005. 6. Separate enquiries followed in connection with all the four Charge Memos namely DI Nos. 2,3,4,5 of 2005, after the culmination of F which, separate reports were submitted by the enquiry officer on 29.03.2007 and 27.04.2007. As per the enquiry reports, some charges stood proved and the other charges were not proved. 7. Therefore, second show cause notices were issued and thereafter the Full Court of the High Court of Karnataka resolved on G 04.10.2008 to impose the penalty of dismissal from service upon the respondent. Based on the resolution of the Full Court, an of dismissal from service was passed by the Governor of Karnataka, vide dated 19.03.2009. 8. Challenging the findings of the enquiry officer, the respondent H filed a set of three writ petitions and challenging the of dismissal THE REGISTRAR GENERAL, HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA v. 55 SRI M. NARASIMHA PRASAD [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] from service, the respondent filed a separate writ petition. All these writ A petitions were dismissed by a learned Judge, through a common dated 30.11.2011. 9. Aggrieved by the same, the respondent filed intra-court appeals. Those appeals were allowed by the Division Bench of the High Court by a very strange , not only setting aside the of penalty and B the findings of the enquiry officer but also directing that no further inquiry can be held against the respondent. It is against such a common passed in a batch of four intra-court appeals that the Registrar General of the High Court has come up with these civil appeals. 10. Before we proceed to consider the correctness of the view C taken by the High Court, in the light of the rival contentions, it will be useful to extract in a tabular column the charges framed against the respondent under each of the Charge Memos; his reply to each of the charges and the findings of the enquiry officer in respect of those charges.
