Since, the High Court has not considered the application of the respondent on merits and has also not considered the mandatory requirement under Section 37(1) (b) of the Act, we deem it appropriate to remand the case to the High Court for deciding the bail application of the respondent afresh on merits and in accordance with law. 41. Since, we are remanding the matter for fresh consideration on merits, we are extending the period of bail granted to the respondent for four [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1435 Narcotics Control Bureau v. Kashif weeks, with a request to the High Court to decide the application afresh as expeditiously as possible, and preferably within four weeks. In case the same is not disposed of within four weeks it shall be open for the High Court to pass appropriate s with regard to extension/non-extension of the said period. 42. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we request the Chief Justice to place the Bail application of the Respondent before the Bench other than the Bench which has passed the impugned , for deciding it afresh. 43. The Appeal stands allowed. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
