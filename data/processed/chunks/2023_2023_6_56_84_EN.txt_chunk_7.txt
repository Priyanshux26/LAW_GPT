6.Defending the action of the respondents and the impugned of the High Court, it is contended by Shri Atmaram N.S. Nadkarni, learned E senior counsel:- (i) that after going through the entire correspondence between the parties, the High Court has recorded findings of fact on various aspects such as the appellants not undertaking the development of any amenity, the appellants not making any claim for Additional TDR and F the lack of approval on the part of the appropriate authority for the development of any amenity; (ii) that these findings of fact do not warrant any interference under Article 136 of the Constitution; (iii) that the rejection of the request for additional TDR, made on G 27.11.1998 was challenged by the appellants only after 12 years and hence the High Court was justified in drawing an inference about the abandonment of claim; (iv) that after the surrender and transfer of the land in favour of the Corporation and the grant of TDR, the appellants ceased to be owners H and hence they were not entitled to claim additional TDR; GODREJ AND BOYCE MANUFACTURING COMPANY LTD. THR. ITS 67 CONSTITUTED ATTORNEY v. THE MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF GREATER MUMBAI [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] (v) that the claim for Additional TDR should be made A simultaneously with the claim for TDR, but the appellants failed to do so; (vi) that the appellants made a claim for Additional TDR only in 1998 after surrendering and transferring the land in the year 1995; B (vii) that in any case, the development of amenities had to be carried out as per the stipulations made by the competent authority; and (viii) that the activities of cutting, leveling, filling, terracing and landscaping cannot be treated as the development of amenity and that therefore the action of the respondents and the of the High Court C were perfectly in . 7.We have carefully considered the rival contentions. 8.From the rival contentions, it appears to us that the following two questions arise for our consideration: (I) Whether the High Court was right in concluding that there D was abandonment of claim by the appellants? ; and (II) Whether the finding of fact arrived at by the High Court that the appellants did not and could not have developed the amenity, calls for any interference, especially in the light of the statutory provisions and the facts that unfold from E the correspondence exchanged between the parties? Question No.I: Whether the High Court was right in concluding that there was abandonment of claim by the appellants? F 9.It is true that the claim made by the appellants for the grant of additional TDR vide their application dated 17.04.1998 was rejected by the Corporation, by a communication dated 27.11.1998 and that the same was challenged by the appellants by way of a writ petition filed after 12 years in September-2010. The High Court held that this delay of 12 years in challenging the action of the respondents tantamount to G abandonment of claim. 10.
