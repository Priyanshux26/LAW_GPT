The relevant paragraph is extracted below: “10. It is clear from the decisions of this Court and a plain reading of Sections 33, 35 and 2(14) of the Act that an instrument which is not duly stamped can be impounded and when the required fee and penalty has been paid for such instrument it can be taken in 173 (1971) 1 SCC 545 174 (2007) 8 SCC 514 119 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. evidence under Section 35 of the Stamp Act. Sections 33 or 35 are not concerned with any copy of the instrument and party can only be allowed to rely on the document which is an instrument within the meaning of Section 2(14). There is no scope for the inclusion of the copy of the document for the purposes of the Stamp Act. Law is now no doubt well settled that copy of the instrument cannot be validated by impounding and this cannot be admitted as secondary evidence under the Stamp Act, 1899.” 217. An arbitration agreement or its certifi ed copy is not rendered void or unenforceable because it is unstamped or insuffi ciently stamped. We accordingly clarify that the position of law laid down in Jupudi Kesava Rao (supra) and Hariom Agrawal (supra) cannot constrain a referral court at Section 11 stage (as well as Section 8 stage) from acting upon a certifi ed copy of an arbitration agreement and referring the parties to arbitral tribunal. 218. The discussion in preceding segments indicates that the referral court at Section 11 stage should not examine or impound an unstamped or insuffi ciently stamped instrument, but rather leave it for the determination by the arbitral tribunal. When a party produces an arbitration agreement or its certifi ed copy, the referral court only has to examine whether an arbitration agreement exists in terms of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act. The referral court under Section 11 is not required to examine whether a certifi ed copy of the agreement/ instrument/ contract discloses the fact of payment of stamp duty on the original. Accordingly, we hold that the holding of this Court in SMS Tea Estate (supra), as reiterated in N N Global 2 (supra), is no longer valid in law. L*. Vidya Drolia does not deal with the issue of stamping 219. The genesis of these proceedings lies in N N Global 1 (supra) doubting the correctness of the fi nding in Vidya Drolia (supra). N N Global 1 (supra) doubted the correctness of the view taken in paragraphs 146 and 147 of the co-ordinate Bench in Vidya Drolia (supra), where the three-Judge Bench relied on Garware Wall Ropes (supra). 220. In paragraph 146, this Court was dealing with the issue of whether the expression “existence” as contained in Section 11(6A) also presupposes the validity of an arbitration agreement. The Court answered this proposition by observing that an arbitration agreement “exists” only * Ed.
