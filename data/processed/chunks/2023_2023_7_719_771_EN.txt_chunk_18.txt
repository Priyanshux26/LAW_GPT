Thus, Section 106 of the Evidence Act will apply to those cases where the prosecution has succeeded in establishing the facts from which a reasonable inference can be drawn regarding the existence of certain other facts which are within the special knowledge of the accused. When the accused fails G to offer proper explanation about the existence of said other facts, the court can always draw an appropriate inference. 23. When a case is resting on circumstantial evidence, if the accused fails to offer a reasonable explanation in discharge 8 AIR 1956 SC 404 9 (2021) 10 SCC 725 H 744 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A of burden placed on him by virtue of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, such a failure may provide an additional link to the chain of circumstances. In a case governed by circumstantial evidence, if the chain of circumstances which is required to be established by the prosecution is not established, the failure of the accused to discharge the burden B under Section 106 of the Evidence Act is not relevant at all. When the chain is not complete, falsity of the defence is no ground to convict the accused.” 32. In Shivaji Chintappa Patil v. State of Maharashtra10, it was observed that Section 106 of the IEA, 1872 does not directly operate C against either a husband or wife staying under the same roof and being the last person seen with the deceased. It was observed that Section 106 of the Evidence Act does not absolve the prosecution of discharging its primary burden of proving the prosecution case beyond reasonable doubt. It is only when the prosecution has led evidence which, if believed, D will sustain a conviction, or which makes out a prima facie case, that the question arises of considering facts of which the burden of proof would lie upon the accused. After expounding the legal principle, while rejecting the argument that failure of the accused to offer explanation under section 313 of the Code would complete the chain, it was observed: E “25. …By now it is well-settled principle of law, that false explanation or non-explanation can only be used as an additional circumstance, when the prosecution has proved the chain of circumstances leading to no other conclusion than the guilt of the accused. However, it cannot be used as a link to complete the chain.” F 33. In the instant case, according to PW4, the deceased was seen alive in that apartment between noon and 1.00 p.m. on 11.09.2000. The information about presence of dead body in that apartment came at about 10.40 a.m. on 12.09.2000. Obviously, in absence of an eyewitness account of the murder, the prosecution cannot disclose the exact time of G the murder but, from the above sequence of events, as per the prosecution case, the murder could have been committed any time between 1.00 p.m. of 11.09.2000 and 10.40 a.m. of 12.09.2000. What is interesting is that during investigation PW3 had disclosed to the police that he noticed Santosh @ Bhure leaving the building with a Gathri (a bag made of H 10 (2021) 5 SCC 626 SANTOSH @ BHURE v. STATE (G.N.C.T.)
