The main dispute in that matter was relating to the entitlement of KPCL to the value of the coal rejects. The Commercial Court had 66 (2005) SCC Online Gau 308; (2005) 275 ITR 502 1208 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports decreed the suits in favour of AEPL by holding that as per the contractual stipulations between the parties, AEPL was only required to dispose off the coal rejects in a manner that would satisfy environmental regulations and KPCL was not entitled to the value of the coal rejects. Learned counsel submits that the terminology used in the contract governing the parties was different and therefore the said judgement does not have any relevance to the facts of the instant case. 5.12 Learned counsel for the respondent-CBI goes on to argue that even the judgement dated 24th March, 2016, passed by the Karnataka High Court in a writ petition filed by KECML against KPCL cannot be of any assistance to the appellants for the reason that the respondent – CBI had not been impleaded as a party in the said proceedings and the said judgement has confined itself to the demands made by KPCL for recovery of amounts from KECML towards the value of the coal rejects. Further, the FIR in the present case was registered on 13th March, 2015 whereas the judgement was delivered by the Karnataka High Court one year later, on 24th March, 2016. By the time the appeal preferred by KPCL against the of the High Court was dismissed by this Court on 20th May, 2022, Charges had already been framed by the learned Special Judge, CBI against the appellants on 24th December, 2021. 5.13 Learned counsel for the respondent–CBI has emphatically argued that Clause 12 of the MoU dated 20th December, 2008 executed between KECML and GCWL states that the rejects shall be the joint property of KECML and GCWL and it shall be disposed of/sold jointly at mutually agreed terms. It is contended that the above clause clearly demonstrates the underlying intent of the appellants to conspire with GCWL to sell the rejects in the market and cause monetary loss to KPCL by depriving it of the value of the rejects. 5.14 The attention of this Court has also been drawn to the letter dated 10th September, 2009, issued by KECML to GCWL enclosing therewith a Debit Note of even date for a sum of ₹ 4,30,38,500/- (Rupees Four crore thirty lakh thirty eight thousand five hundred only) towards “disposal of foreign material during washing” and it has been argued that the said Debit Note was raised on the [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1209 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation instructions of Mr. Purujit Roy (accused No. 9), as stated by Mr. N.K. Ganorkar (PW 26) who was one of the two signatories of the said Debit Note and Mr. S.K. Gupta, an employee of GCWL (PW 16). 5.15 Learned counsel for the respondent–CBI also referred to a Certificate dated 12th July, 2010 issued by Mr. Avijit Sarkar who was working in the Finance and Accounts Department of KECML.
