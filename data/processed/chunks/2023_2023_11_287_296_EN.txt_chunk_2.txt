By this legal notice, arbitration was invoked by Baker. 5. A three-member tribunal was constituted, which adjudicated the claims. Eventually, under the award2, MMTC was held liable to pay US $ 5,10,215/- to Baker, for two distinct periods. The award was challenged by MMTC through objections. The objections were rejected by the learned single judge and the award was made the rule of court.3 MMTC appealed the affi rmation of the award by the learned single judge. On appeal, the Division Bench, by the impugned upheld the single judge’s fi ndings, to the extent the award granted damages for the period January-June, 1992, but set it aside for the balance period. 6. Some of the relevant clauses of the agreement dated 14.01.1986 which are material for this case are extracted below: “Clause 6:- The price will be settled half yearly and shall be in line with Canadian producers prices to their long terms contract customers. Both parties will make utmost eff orts to settle the prices for supplies during January - June by 15th January and for supplies during July -December by 15th July of that year. In case no settlement on price for deliveries during a semester is possible, the quantity allocated for that period may stand lapse or reduced and both parties shall meet again to negotiate prices for subsequent period.” Clause 5:- The agreement shall be operative for three years from 1st January, 1986 and will be extended annually on ever green basis unless cancelled by either party on six months written notice.” 7. In arbitration, Baker contended that MMTC had committed a breach of the contract dated 20.12.1991 for the purchase of 50,000 metric tons of sulphur during the period January-June 1992 (fi rst half of 1992). Baker claimed damages for MMTC’s failure to lift sulphur of the same quantity during the second half of 1992 and two half yearly semesters 2 Award dated 07.02.1996 3 By dated 05.09.2001 in Suit No 1038-A of 1996& IA No 6093 of 1996. H. J. BAKER AND BROS. INC. v. THE MINERALS AND METALS 291 TRADE CORP. LTD. (MMTC) [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] each of 1993 and 1994. The three-member tribunal held that MMTC had committed a breach of the contract and its commitments and responsibility to lift 50,000 metric tons of sulphur during the fi rst half of 1992 remained intact. The single judge found that this plea was justifi ed, and upheld the tribunal’s fi ndings for award of damages for the period January-June, 1992 at US$ 200,000/- and for the balance period (June-December 1992) at US$ 300,000/-. Damages for the latter period were held to be unwarranted by the impugned . Contentions of parties 8. Appearing for Baker, Mr. Ramesh Singh, learned senior counsel and Ms. Bina Gupta, learned counsel, argued that the basis on which the impugned proceeded to interfere with the award, i.e., it did not take into account the principles underlying the award of damages is incorrect. It was urged that the circumstance that a party had not gone to the market or did not make attempts to mitigate its losses, disentitled it to damages, is an incorrect premise.
