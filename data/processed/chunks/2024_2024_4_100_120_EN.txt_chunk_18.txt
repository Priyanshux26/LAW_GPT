On the record, there is no direct allegation of any bias against or victimisation of the respondent as he himself has stated as also written to various persons venting his grievances. Only because things did not turn out the way the respondent wanted them to, or for that his grievances were not adequately or appropriately addressed, cannot lead to the presumption that the resignation was forced upon him by the Company. One way to label the respondent’s resignation as “forced” would be to attribute the compulsion to the respondent, rather than factors relating to the Company and/or its management. In other words, it can be termed a result of feeling suffocated due to lack of proper appreciation and not being given his rightful due that led to the chain of events supra, rather than by way of any arbitrariness or high-handedness on the part of the appellant. Bearing due regard to the nature of duties performed by the respondent, we are satisfied that the same do not entail him being placed under the cover of Section 2(s), ID Act. 29. For reasons aforesaid, this appeal succeeds and is, accordingly, allowed. The impugned as well as the rendered by the learned Single Judge are set aside. The of the Labour Court is revived and restored. Ex consequenti, it is held and declared that the respondent is not a “workman” and thus, reference to the Labour Court under the ID Act against the appellant would not be maintainable. We commend the respondent for his spirited resistance to the appeal. 30. Parties to bear their own costs. Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey Result of the case: Appeal allowed.
