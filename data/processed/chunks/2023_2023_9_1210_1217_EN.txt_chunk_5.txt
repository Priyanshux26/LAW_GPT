In Para 106 it stated as under: Thus, we hold that though only a prima facie case is to be established from the evidence led before the court, not necessarily tested on the anvil of cross-examination, it F requires much stronger evidence than mere probability of his complicity. The test that has to be applied is one which is more than prima facie case as exercised at the time of framing of charge, but short of satisfaction to an extent that the evidence, if goes unrebutted, would lead to G conviction. In the absence of such satisfaction, the court should refrain from exercising power under Section 319 CrPC. In Section 319 CrPC the purpose of providing if “it appears from the evidence that any person not being the accused has committed any offence” it is clear from the words “for which such person could be tried together with H SANDEEP KUMAR v. THE STATE OF HARYANA & ANR. 1217 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] the accused”. The words used are not “for which such A person could be convicted”. There is, therefore, no scope for the court acting under Section 319 CrPC to form any opinion as to the guilt of the accused.” In our considered opinion, the prosecution had fully made out its case for summoning the three as accused under Section 319, Cr.PC, so B that they may also face trial. 6. Under these circumstances, the appeal is allowed and the of the High Court dated 02.03.2022, is hereby set aside. It is further directed that the trial shall proceed now in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible. C Ankit Gyan Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Aarsh Choudhary, LCRA) D E F G H
