v. Union of India & Ors. enumerated certain basic features of our Constitution, including the secular character of the Constitution.48 In S R Bommai v. Union of India,49 a nine-Judge Bench held that secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution. The issue that arises for our consideration is whether the basic structure doctrine can be applied to invalidate ordinary legislation. 47. The Constitution imposes certain limitations on the legislative powers of Parliament and the State legislatures. Article 13(2) provides that the State shall not make any law that takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III. Statutes enacted by the State legislatures must be consistent with the fundamental rights enumerated under Part III of the Constitution. Further, Article 246 defines the scope and limitations of the legislative competence of Parliament and State legislatures. A statute can be declared ultra vires on two grounds alone: (i) it is beyond the ambit of the legislative competence of the legislature; or (ii) it violates Part III or any other provision of the Constitution.50 48. In Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain,51 the Allahabad High Court disqualified the then Prime Minister for indulging in corrupt practices according to the Representation of the People Act, 1951. To nullify the decision of the High Court, Parliament enacted the Representation of the People (Amendment) Act 1974 and Election Laws (Amendment) Act 1975 and placed them under the Ninth cannot be destroyed and done away with; it is regained though in the amended form. What then is meant by the retention of the old Constitution? It means the retention of the basic structure or framework of the old Constitution. A mere retention of some provisions of the old Constitution even though the basic structure or framework of the Constitution has been destroyed would not amount to the retention of the old Constitution. Although it is permissible under the power of amendment to effect changes, howsoever important, and to adapt the system to the requirements of changing conditions, it is not permissible to touch the foundation or to alter the basic institutional pattern. The words “amendment of the Constitution” with all their wide sweep and amplitude cannot have the effect of destroying or abrogating the basic structure or framework of the Constitution.”] 48 Kesavananda Bharati (supra) [292] (Chief Justice Sikri); [487] (Justice Shelat and Grover); [1426] (Justice H R Khanna). 49 [1994] 2 SCR 644 : (1994) 3 SCC 1; [29] (Justice AM Ahmadi); [151] (Justice P B Sawant (for himself and Justice Kuldip Singh)); [182] (Justice K Ramaswamy); [304] (Justice B P Jeevan Reddy (for himself and Justice S C Agrawal)) 50 State of A P v.
