A and that therefore applications under Rule 97 or 99 of XXI are not maintainable, at the instance of the -debtors, or persons claiming through them. 78. The of the High Court dated 10.11.1998 became the subject matter of challenge before this Court in Civil Appeal Nos.7983 B of 2001 with Civil Appeal Nos.7984-85 & 7986-88 of 2001.These appeals were allowed by this Court by a decision dated 23.11.2001, reported in NSS Naryana Sarma vs. M/s Goldstone Exports Private Ltd.5 This Court took the view that the claim petitions were very much maintainable, as the claim petitioners were claiming rights independently under the provisions of the Jagir Abolition Regulations. After so holding, this Court C remanded the matter back to the High Court for a fresh consideration of the claim petitions. This Court directed that the petitions filed by the appellants before this Court (in that case) had to be placed before a Single Judge for consideration. 79. Accordingly, all the applications including Application No.994 D of 1995 were placed before L. Narasimha Reddy, J., (as he then was). The learned Judge framed as many as 11 issues and 2 additional issues as arising for consideration in all those applications. 80. Eventually, the learned Judge disposed of all the applications by an dated 26.10.2004, whose operative portion, extracted E hereunder, is self-explanatory: “68. For the foregoing reasons; (a) Application No.994 of 1995 is dismissed. (b) Application Nos.585 and 708 of 2002, and 1318 to 1320 F of 2003 are allowed. (c) The petitioners pleaded throughout that the land in question was vacant. It has already been found that the filing of E.P. in the Court of District Judge, Ranga Reddy District and the various steps taken therein are contrary to law. Hence, G the alleged delivery of possession in favour of the petitioners, is held to be symbolic. (d) The respondents are found to be holding title and possession of the lands covered by the respective sale deeds H 5 (2002) 1 SCC662 M/s TRINITY INFRAVENTURES LTD. & ORS. ETC. v. M. S. 321 MURTHY & ORS. ETC. [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] in their favour. Inasmuch as the delivery of possession was A only symbolic, that too as regards vacant land, it shall be open to them to remain in possession of the said land. The petitioners do not have ony right. title and interest in respect of the land. which constituted the subject matter of E.P.No.3 of 1996. B (e) In case there is any resistance from the petitioners as to the right of the respondents to remain in possession of the land, the District Court, Ranga Reddy shall direct re-delivery of possession of such land to the respondents, if an application is filed for this purpose. C (f) It shall be open to the petitioners to take such steps as are open to them in law, in relation to the assignment of rights in their favour.” 81. Aggrieved by the said of the learned Single Judge dated 26.10.2004, the assignees of decrees filed a batch of appeals in OSA D Nos.
