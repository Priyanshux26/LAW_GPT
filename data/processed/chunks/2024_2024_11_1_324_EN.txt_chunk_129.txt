222. The materiality of a privately owned resource and whether it has a community element cannot be determined in a vacuum and must be identified on a case-by-case basis. The underlying reference s, limit our mandate to examining the correctness of the interpretation in Ranganatha Reddy and Sanjeev Coke, without assessing the applicability of Article 39(b) to any specific resources or legislation. We may, therefore, only outline guiding principles to determine whether a particular privately owned resource falls within the fold 178 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the provision. The following factors may be borne in mind while determining whether the resource constitutes a ‘material resource of the community’: a. The nature of the resource and its inherent characteristics; b. The impact of the resource on the well-being of the community; c. The scarcity of the resource; and d. The consequences of such a resource being concentrated in the hands of private owners. 223. There are various forms of resources, which may be privately owned, and inherently have a bearing on ecology and/or the well-being of the community. Such resources fall within the net of Article 39(b). To illustrate, non-exhaustively, there may exist private ownership of forests, ponds, fragile areas, wetlands and resource-bearing lands. Similarly, resources like spectrum, airwaves, natural gas, mines and minerals, which are scarce and finite, may sometimes be within private control. However, as the community has a vital interest in the retention of the character of these resources, they fall within the ambit of the expression “material resources of the community”. 224. We may refer to the Public Trust Doctrine that has been evolved by this Court in a consistent line of precedent, to better understand the ‘community’ element of such resources. 156 This doctrine provides that the State holds all natural resources as a trustee of the public and must deal with them in a manner consistent with the nature of the trust. The doctrine was introduced to Indian jurisprudence by a two-judge bench decision of this Court in M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath157 This Court, speaking through Justice Kuldip Singh, held that the doctrine is rooted in the principle that certain resources like “air, sea, waters and forests” hold such importance to the people, as a whole, that it would be unjustified to make them a subject of private ownership. This Court held that the doctrine mandates the Government to protect the resources for the enjoyment of the general public, rather than to permit their use for commercial gains. 156 M.C. Mehta v.
