Learned senior counsel for the resolution applicant, Dr. Abhishek M. Singhvi, appearing in the lead matter has emphatically argued against the impugned while questioning the findings and observations of the Appellate Tribunal with the following principal F submissions: 28.1. As regards the proposition of settlement put forward by the promoter with reference to Section 12-A of the Code, it has been contended that the entitlement to file for withdrawal of the application admitted under Section 7 of the Code would be restricted to TFCI i.e., G the applicant who had filed the application, with the approval of ninety per cent. voting share of the CoC and such an application for withdrawal could have only been moved through the resolution professional. In the absence of any such move by TFCI, the promoter did not have any right to move an application for withdrawal. H M. K. RAJAGOPALAN v. DR. PERIASAMY PALANI 845 GOUNDER & ANR. [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] 28.1.1. It has further been submitted that the letter of settlement A dated 21.01.2021 was submitted without proof of funds and there was no commitment towards funding in the proposal indicated in the Deutsche Bank Indicative Term-Sheet dated 22.01.2021. Even the letter of support for funds dated 14.07.2021 as issued by Saveetha Institute was withdrawn by a subsequent email dated 02.09.2021. Thereafter, in the eleventh B CoC meeting dated 03.03.2022 that took place after the passing of the impugned NCLAT , respondent No. 1 relied upon the settlement proposal, without placing any funds on the table in support thereof. This settlement proposal thus had been nothing but an attempt to delay the CIRP proceedings as rightly observed by NCLT. C 28.2. As regards the questions concerning eligibility of the appellant to act as resolution applicant, it has been submitted by the learned senior counsel that Section 88 of the Trusts Act would not be treated as a ground for disqualification of the appellant under Section 29-A of the Code.
