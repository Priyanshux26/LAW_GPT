17. As would be clear from hereinabove, the very basis of the in Sagufa Ahmed (supra) that under the 23.03.2020 , only the period of limitation has been extended and not the period up to which delay can be condoned, has been taken away by expanding the protection by excluding the period even for computing outer limits within which the court or tribunal can condone delay. This is an important subsequent aspect which has a great bearing in deciding the present controversy. 18. Prakash Corporates case (supra) also notices the fact that the of 08.03.2021 and subsequent s also by a Bench of three Hon’ble Judges were not and could not have been available for the Bench which decided Sagufa Ahmed’s case (supra) since Sagufa Ahmed’s case (supra) was decided on 18.09.2020. In Prakash Corporates (supra), though the period of 30 days for fi ling written statements expired on 05.02.2021 and the 120-day outer limit expired on 06.05.2021, written statements notarized on 07.07.2021 was directed to be taken on record. The Court in Prakash Corporates (supra) relied on the s of 23.03.2020, 08.03.2021, 27.04.2021 and also noticed the of 23.09.2021 while so ing. 19. By virtue of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 brought into force on 23.10.2015 some provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to the commercial disputes ADITYA KHAITAN & ORS. v. IL AND FS FINANCIAL 813 SERVICES LIMITED [K. V. VISWANATHAN, J.] were amended. The schedule to the Commercial Courts Act amended 5 Rule 1(1), 8 Rule 1 and 8 Rule 10 insofar as their applicability to commercial disputes was concerned. 8 Rule 1 reads as under: “ 8 Rule 1 “1. Written statement.- The defendant shall, within thirty days from the date of service of summons on him, present a written statement of his defence: Provided that where the defendant fails to fi le the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to fi le the written statement on such other day, as may be specifi ed by the court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the court deems fi t, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to fi le the written statement and the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.” 20. As would be seen from the above, the outer limit within which the court or tribunal can condone the delay is 120 days from the date of summons. 21. As has been set out hereinabove, while summons was served on 07.02.2020, the 30 days period expired on 08.03.2020 and the outer limit of 120 days expired on 06.06.2020. The application for taking on record the written statements and the extension of time was fi led on 20.01.2021.
