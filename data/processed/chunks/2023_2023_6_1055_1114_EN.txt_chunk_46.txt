E 43.In the light of our findings and the reasons we have disclosed above for arriving at such finding, we accept the report of the Inquiring Judge. We declare that the date of birth of the applicant as reflected in the certificate issued by the Rajkiya Adarsh Uccha Madhaymik Vidyalaya, Jalabsar, tehsil - Shri Dungargarh, district – Bikaner, dated F 30th January 2019, a copy of which has been annexed in the Inquiry Report as “I-2”, is to be accepted for determining his age at the time of commission of the offence of which he has been convicted. Going by that certificate, his age at the time of commission of offence was 12 years and 6 months. Thus, he was a child/juvenile on the date of G commission of offence for which he has been convicted, in terms of the provisions of the 2015 Act. This shall be deemed to be the true age of Niranaram, who was tried and convicted as Narayan. He has already served more than 3 years of incarceration and under the law as it prevailed at the time of commission of offence as also under the 2015 Act, he cannot be subjected to capital punishment. In view of this finding, the H 1114 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A sentencing him to death passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Pune in Sessions Case No. 462 of 1994 and subsequently confirmed by the High Court and by this Court would stand invalidated by operation of law. He shall be set free forthwith from the correctional home in which he remains imprisoned, as he has suffered imprisonment for more than 28 years, having regard to the provisions of Section 18 of the 2015 Act. B Section 21 of the 1986 Act also carried substantially the same provision on the question of maximum punishment that can be awarded to a delinquent juvenile by the Juvenile Court. The restriction on term of detention that can be awarded by the Board under the 2015 Act to a child below 16 years would also apply to the Court before which the C juvenility question is being determined. 44. I.A. No. 5242 of 2016 as also I.A. No. 5245 of 2016 are applications taken out by the applicant for reopening the review petition. We are of the view, however, that an application under Section 9(2) of the 2015 Act is an independent proceeding and we have decided the D same without revisiting the review . Crl. M.P. No. 155609 of 2019 has been filed by the intervenor raising objection to the inquiry report. We dispose of the same as we have considered the content of this petition. All other applications shall stand disposed of. 45.The present application stands allowed in the above terms. E Ankit Gyan Application allowed.
