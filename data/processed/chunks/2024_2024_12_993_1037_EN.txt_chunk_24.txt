The notice under Section 52(2) was also not pasted at a conspicuous area of the locality in which the property is situated. The State Government only published the notice in the official gazette. b) This Court in the case of Kolkata Municipal Corporation (supra)has held that the “right to be heard” forms an integral part of the seven sub-rights that have been synchronously incorporated in laws concerning compulsory acquisition. Improper service of notice under Section 52(2) runs the risk of contravening the “right to be heard”. Whether the objective of making the respondents aware was achieved or not has to be tested on the basis of concrete evidence placed on record by the parties. c) For the reasons stated hereinabove, we move directly to ascertain whether the improper service of notice prejudiced the rights of the landowners. From the documents placed on record before us, we find that the representations made by [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1029 Urban Improvement Trust v. Smt. Vidhya Devi and Ors. the landowners dated 30.10.1976, 01.11.1976, 30.12.1976, 17.01.1977, 07.02.1977, 24.02.1977 and 10.03.1977 were only from legal heirs of two of the original landowners, that is the late Mr. Ram Narain and Mr. Yogesh Chand Goyal. We find that there is no evidence of the participation by the other two original landowners that is, Mr. Radhey Shyam and Mr. Manohar Lal or their legal heirs. The appellant Trust or the State Government has also not adduced any evidence whether written or oral that these two landowners and their legal heirs actively participated in the acquisition proceedings and made their objections heard. d) The appellant’s contention that there is a presumption as per illustration (e) of Section 114 of the Evidence Act, 1872 that the notification under Section 52(1) was in conformity with the provisions of the RUI Act unless dislodged by the respondents, is of no avail to them. Such presumption is available to the State in cases where the owner or interested party had not gotten their names recorded in the revenue records thereby disabling the State from identifying who the interested parties are. This has been the position adopted by this Court in Ahuja Industries Ltd. v. State of Karnataka & Others reported in (2003) 5 SCC 365 and the split verdict by Manoj Misra J. in the case of Urban Improvement Trust, Bikaner v. Gordhan Dass (D.) through LRs. & others reported in (2024) 3 SCC 250 wherein it was held that “mere non-service of notice, under Section 52(2) of the 1959 Act, upon non-recorded owner, such as the plaintiff, would not render the acquisition notification under Section 52(1) void…” However, in the present case, there was no question of the landowners’ names not being present in the revenue records, therefore, the presumption under Section 114(e) of the Evidence Act, 1872 is of no help to the appellant’s case. e) We find from the records placed before us that improper service of notice under Section 52(2) did in fact prejudice the rights of the two original landowners and their legal heirs and they were not provided with an opportunity to be heard.
