But a still worse consequence may follow, in that it may leave open a scope for malpractices. G The date of selection may be so fixed or manipulated as to entertain some applicants and reject others, arbitrarily. Hence, in the absence of a fixed date indicated in the advertisement/notification inviting applications with reference to which the requisite qualifications 10 (1993) 2 SCC 429 H 11 1993 Supp (3) SCC 168 SAKSHI ARHA v. THE RAJASTHAN HIGH COURT AND 635 OTHERS [BELA M. TRIVEDI, J.] should be judged, the only certain date for the scrutiny of the A qualifications will be the last date for making the applications. We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that when the Selection Committee in the present case, as argued by Shri Manoj Swarup, took into consideration the requisite qualifications as on the date of selection rather than on the last date of preferring applications, B it acted with patent illegality, and on this ground itself the selections in question are liable to be quashed. Reference in this connection may also be made to two recent decisions of this Court in A.P. Public Service Commission, Hyderabad v. B. Sarat Chandra [(1990) 2 SCC 669 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 377 : (1990) 4 SLR 235 : (1990) 13 ATC 708] and District Collector & C Chairman, Vizianagaram Social Welfare Residential School Society, Vizianagaram v. M. Tripura Sundari Devi [(1990) 3 SCC 655 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 520 : (1990) 4 SLR 237 : (1990) 14 ATC 766] .” 32.A Three-Judge Bench of this Court in Ashok Kumar Sharma D & Ors. Vs. Chander Shekhar & Anr.12, observed as under: - “6. The proposition that where applications are called for prescribing a particular date as the last date for filing the applications, the eligibility of the candidates shall have to be judged with reference to that date and that date alone, is a well-established E one. A person who acquires the prescribed qualification subsequent to such prescribed date cannot be considered at all. An advertisement or notification issued/published calling for applications constitutes a representation to the public and the authority issuing it is bound by such representation. It cannot act F contrary to it. One reason behind this proposition is that if it were known that persons who obtained the qualifications after the prescribed date but before the date of interview would be allowed to appear for the interview, other similarly placed persons could also have applied. Just because some of the persons had applied notwithstanding that they had not acquired the prescribed G qualifications by the prescribed date, they could not have been treated on a preferential basis.” 33.It is also pertinent to note that if the appellants were allowed to produce the certificates issued after the last date fixed for the 12 (1997) 4 SCC 18 H 636 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A submission of applications mentioned in the advertisement i.e. 31.08.2021, the other candidates similarly situated as the appellants might raise a grievance for not giving them such opportunity.
