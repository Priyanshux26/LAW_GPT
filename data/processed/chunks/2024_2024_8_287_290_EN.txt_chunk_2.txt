Considering all these oral and documentary evidence, the Tribunal has taken the disability of the appellant only at 25% and determined the compensation payable to him. Without assigning plausible reason, the High Court re-assessed the compensation by reducing the disability suffered by the appellant to 20%. We are of the view that the reduction of compensation was not required, particularly, when there is no basis in support thereof. Therefore, the passed by the High Court is liable to be interfered with. 11. Accordingly, the impugned dated 13.11.2018 passed by the High Court in MFA No.103118 of 2014 (MV) is set aside and the dated 28.06.2014 passed by the Tribunal in MAC No.1587 of 2013 fixing the disability of the appellant at 25% is restored. The insurance company is directed to deposit the entire compensation along with interest as determined by the Tribunal, after adjusting the amounts already deposited, before the Tribunal, within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this . On such deposit being made, the appellant is permitted to withdraw the same. 12. This Civil Appeal is allowed. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
