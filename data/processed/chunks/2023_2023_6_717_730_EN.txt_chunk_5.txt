Having considered the purpose and object of Article 299, we are of the clear opinion that a contract entered into in the name of the President of India, cannot and will not create an immunity against the application of any statutory prescription imposing conditions on parties D to an agreement, when the Government chooses to enter into a contract. We are unable to trace any immunity arising out of Article 299, to support the contention that for contracts expressed to be made by the President of India, the ineligibility of appointment as an arbitrator as contemplated under Section 12(5) of the Act, read with Schedule VII, will be E inapplicable. 14. We have no hesitation in rejecting the submission of the learned ASG that the contracts entered into by the Union of India in the name of the President of India are immune from provisions that protect against conflict of interest of a party to a contract, under Section 12(5) of the Act. F Re: Conflict of the Arbitration Clause with Section 12(5) read with paragraph 1 of the Seventh Schedule of the Act. 15. The tender notice dated 02.02.2011 was issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs for the purchase of G Glock pistols. Applicant’s bid was accepted on 31.03.2011 as per the 11See Chatturbhuj Vithaldas Jasaniv. Moreshwar Parashram And Others (1954) SCR 817; K. P.C howdhry v. State of Madhya Pradesh.

UNION OF INDIA 725 [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J.] Terms and Conditions contained in the Tender No. D/21013/30/3218/ A 2.11.2011/PW-3. The said Terms and Conditions specifically provided for Arbitration as per Clause 28 of the Schedule appended to the Tender. The Arbitration clause enables the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, to appoint an arbitrator for the resolution of disputes arising out of this contract. The Ministry of Home Affairs is a party to the contract. The B arbitration clause enables the Secretary representing the Ministry to appoint an officer in the Ministry of Law as the arbitrator. In other words, the proposed arbitrator would be an employee of the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India, and at the same time, the appointing authority, the Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, is also an employee of the Government of India.12 C 16. In this very context, we can beneficially refer to the recommendation of the 246th Law Commission Report which reflected on the issue of contracts with State entities and observed that when the party appointing an arbitrator is the State, the duty to appoint an impartial and independent adjudicator is even more onerous. Their deliberations D and recommendations, which led to the introduction of Section 12(5) with the Seventh Schedule in the Act, are extracted as follows: “56. The limits of this provision has been tested in the Indian Supreme Court in the context of contracts with State entities naming particular persons/designations (associated with that E entity) as a potential arbitrator.
