That thereafter on 01.03.2018, the Acting Chief Justice took a decision that those candidates, whose marks have been increased and their marks are found to be higher than the candidates already appointed, they may be appointed against the vacant 22 vacancies of private secretaries without disturbing those 27 D candidates already appointed. At this stage, it is required to be noted that in the administrative note dated 01.03.2018, it was observed by the Acting Chief Justice that because of limited re-evaluation of only 13 candidates, that too, to limited questions, an unfortunate situation has resulted. However, if re-evaluation of all papers is now undertaken, it would result in unwarranted delay and the appointments having been effected one E year ago, it is difficult to set the clock back. Therefore, the Acting Chief Justice took a decision that 08 candidates whose marks have been increased on re-evaluation and are found to be having more marks than the candidates already appointed, they may be appointed against 22 vacancies vacant as those 08 candidates would stand qualified upon re- F evaluation. The Acting Chief Justice also observed that the issue which requires consideration is as to how to fix the seniority and, therefore, the matter was referred to the Special Committee on the aspect of fixation of seniority. 2.8 The Special Committee in its meeting held on 07.03.2018 recommended that the 05 already selected candidates whose papers G were re-evaluated, would now still be entitled to grant of benefit of seniority vis-à-vis the other private secretaries and with those who were newly selected would be at the bottom of the seniority (in case of 06 newly selected). That the re-evaluated result was declared and uploaded on the internet as also displayed on the notice board on 12.03.2018. H 92 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A Thereafter, a notification dated 14.03.2018 recommending appointment of 06 newly selected candidates came to be issued w.e.f. 12.03.2018. 2.9 That thereafter the respondent – original writ petitioner - Dinesh Kumar moved a representation seeking re-evaluation on 25.05.2018, i.e., after a period of 15 months from the date of obtaining the copy of B answer sheet on 20.02.2017. Other similar writ petitions were also filed belatedly. That thereafter the appellants herein – the candidates, who were dissatisfied by the denial of seniority as per the increased marks, filed representations on 16.07.2018 with a request that their seniority be considered as per the revised marks and they may be put in the seniority list / select list on appropriate places. That all the representations were C placed before the Special Committee on 20.07.2018. The Special Committee rejected the representation of the respondent – Dinesh Kumar stating that relief of re-evaluation cannot be granted at a belated stage and in light of in the case of Saphalta Bhati (supra). However, thereafter on the representations made by the appellants and the other D candidates, who were dissatisfied by the denial of seniority as per the increased marks, in the meeting dated 01.10.2018, the Special Committee decided to accord notional seniority in accordance with revised marks to the candidates.
