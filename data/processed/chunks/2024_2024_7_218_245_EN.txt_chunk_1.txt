forgot to describe the room on the spot map – It is a case where eyewitnesses corroborated each other; their depositions are reinforced by deceased himself in his statement recorded u/s. 161 CrPC, and the location of the incident is depicted on the spot map as a `brick room’ – Thus, stands established that there was another Jhuggi where the deceased sought refuge and was eventually assaulted – So-called contradiction fails to invade the corpus delicti. [Paras 33, 34] First information report – Non-reading of contents of FIR to the complainant – Effect: Held: Subject FIR fully satisfies all the ingredients of s. 154 CrPC – During the cross-examination, the complainant-informant claimed that the Police neither read out the FIR to her nor did it mention the contents of her statements which were recorded by the Police – Assuming it to be correct, such omission did not cause any prejudice to the appellant – Not a case where the appellant was not provided with a copy of the FIR or the charge sheet, which could have hindered his ability to effectively cross-examine the informant – Also no suggestion that he was not present at the scene, that he did not participate in the incident, or that he was falsely implicated for any reason – Appellant, thus, failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the alleged non-reading of the contents of the FIR 220 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports to the informant – Reading over of the information after it is written down, the signing of the said information by the informant, and the entry of its substance in the prescribed manner not obligatory, but procedural in nature, and the omission of any of them does not impact the legal consequences resulting from the information provided – Furthermore, when testimonies of eyewitnesses are consistent, unimpeachable, and duly corroborated by medical evidence or recovery of weapon used, the deficiencies, if any, in recording of FIR alone do not constitute a valid ground to overturn the conviction or undermine the prosecution case. [Paras 40-44] Evidence – Presence of appellant on the place of occurrence, if doubtful: Held: No reason to doubt that the appellant was not only present at the scene of crime, but he actively participated in the occurrence and gave one of the fatal blows to deceased – Submission of poor visibility owing to darkness at the spot of occurrence not tenable – Place of occurrence, was adjacent to that of the complainant making it easier for the witnesses to observe and identify the accused persons – Each accused, particularly the appellant, was familiar to the eyewitnesses – Considering that the incident occurred on a summer night, there would have been minimal obstruction to visibility for the witnesses – Appellant, in his 313 CrPC statement, nowhere took the plea of alibi also did not pursue this defence during the cross-examination of witnesses either, as also did not adduce any evidence in support thereof – Furthermore, not a case where the complainant or prosecution witness held grudges against the appellant and fabricated a story to implicate him after the incident – Rather, the name of the appellant surfaced in the very first version, duly recorded, within less than two hours of the occurrence – Also no motive to falsely implicate the appellant indicated.
