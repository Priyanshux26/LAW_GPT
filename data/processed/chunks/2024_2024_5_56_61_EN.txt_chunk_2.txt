3.5 On 26.09.2015, the SDJM, Bhubaneshwar passed an of cognizance for offence u/s 420, 467, 468, 471, 477(A), 120(B) and 34 IPC and issue of process against the Respondents and the other accused persons which was challenged by the Respondents before the High Court. 3.6 The High Court in its impugned , quashed the taking cognizance against the respondents. It reasoned that there was insufficient evidence of a conspiracy directly implicating the respondents and criticized the preliminary stage of judicial scrutiny as overly thorough, contrary to the standards required for prima facie evaluation at the stage of taking cognizance. 4. The appellant-State contends that the High Court overlooked circumstantial evidence suggestive of a broader conspiracy involving the respondents, particularly highlighting their professional acumen in real estate, which should have informed them of the dubious 2 In short, “GPA” 60 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports nature of the transactions. Furthermore, the State argued that the High Court failed to appreciate the severity of the offences involved and the potential implications for governance and public trust in the administration of land records. 5. Having heard the arguments on both sides, this Court is of the belief that the impugned of the High Court merits reconsideration. The investigation into Respondent No. 1 (accused no. 7) and Respondent No. 2 (accused no. 10) reveals their critical roles in the misuse of GPA and subsequent property transactions, presenting a strong prima facie case for further examination.

The manipulation of the GPA where specific terms were altered to misrepresent the authority granted, was carried out with the help of one Ajya Kumar Samal, a junior clerk (accused no.3). This act of forgery was a deliberate attempt to circumvent the legal procedure for transferring property. Following this forgery, extensive lands were sold at significantly lowered values. Specifically, lands in the heart of Bhubaneswar city were acquired for as little as Rs. 9,000/- per acre, whereas the prevailing market rates exceeded Rs. 50 lakhs per acre. Such drastic undervaluation raises substantial questions regarding the intent behind these transactions, indicative of a deliberate scheme to evade appropriate stamp duties and registration fees, causing considerable loss to the state. Crucially, part of this land was bought under suspicious conditions by Respondent No. 1 and Puspa Choudhury (accused no.8), in transactions managed by Prahallad Nanda (accused no. 2), who was temporarily in charge of the Sub-Registrar’s office. The intentional undervaluation of this land and the strategic involvement of Respondent No. 1, in conjunction with the revocation of the GPA due to its fraudulent tampering, highlight a clear scheme to misappropriate government property and incur losses upon the public exchequer. 7. Furthermore, Respondent No. 1, who is the wife of Respondent No.
