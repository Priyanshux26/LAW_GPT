The amendment carried out is retrospective as it is clarifi catory in nature. Even if the caste certifi cate in the case in hand was cancelled prior to the notifi cation of the amendment in Section 8A of the 1994 Act, the issue can still be examined by the Committee. Now it has power to deal with the same. Even otherwise, respondents No. 15 to 18 could not be left remediless. If they could not challenge the cancellation of caste certifi cate before the Committee or any other authority, they could certainly avail their remedy by fi ling a writ petition. He further submitted that presently respondents No. 15 to 18 are carrying on minimal work and are hardly able to make their both ends meet. 25. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the relevant referred record. 26. The primary issue in the case in hand is with reference tocaste certifi cate issued to the respondent No. 15. A certifi cate was issued in his favour on 23.04.1993 declaring him as belonging to ‘Chik Baraik’, a Scheduled Tribe. It is inter-related with the sale transactions of the land. In case, respondent No. 15 belongs to Scheduled Tribe community, permission is required for selling the land. In case, he is not, no permission is required. In the case in hand, the sale deed which is subject matter of dispute was executed by late Ramanand Baraik, father of respondent No. 15 in favour of Sanjay Gupta and two others on 30.08.1983. 27. To appreciate the arguments of learned counsel for the parties, we deem it appropriate to extract the details of various sale deeds executed by late Ramanand Baraik, father of respondent No. 15. These are detailed out in paragraph No. 8 of the memo dated 03.04.2013 issued by District Magistrate. The same are extracted below: 11 The West Bengal Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Identifi cation) (Amendment) Act, 2017 950 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. Sl. Regd.
