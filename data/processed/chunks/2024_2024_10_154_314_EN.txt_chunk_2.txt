pertaining to any child pornographic material without actually possessing or storing it in any device or in any form or manner, such act would still tantamount to ‘possession’ in terms of Section 15 of the POCSO, if he exercised an invariable degree of control over such material, applying the doctrine of constructive possession – Thus, in terms of the Doctrine of Constructive Possession, any form of intangible or constructive possession of any child pornographic material will also amount to “possession” under Section 15 of the POCSO – There is no requirement of a physical or tangible “storage” or “possession” of such material in Section 15 – Thus, where any child pornographic material is in the constructive possession of an accused, the failure or omission to report the same would constitute the requisite actus-reus for the purposes of Section 15 sub-section (1) of POCSO. [Paras 114, 117, 118, 122] Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s.15(1), (2), (3) – ‘mens rea’ required under – Distinction between: Held: Section 15 sub-section (1) requires the existence of the requisite mens rea or intention due to which the child pornographic material was not deleted, destroyed or reported whereas, Section 15 sub-section (2) requires the existence of the requisite mens rea or intention which propelled or led the person accused to not only store or possess the said material but also to take some additional steps towards either the actual transmission, propagation, display or distribution or the facilitation of the same – In contrast, Section 15 sub-section (3) requires the existence of the requisite mens rea or intention due to which the person accused not only stored or possessed the child pornographic material but also compelled him to take some additional steps either for any gain or benefit or 158 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in lieu or expectation of some form of gain or benefit – Distinction further explained through examples. [Para 95] Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s.15 – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act, 2019 – ‘Possession’ added to make s.15 more stringent to deter the dissemination and use of child pornography: Held: Word “possession” was originally absent in the unamended Section 15 and the legislature specifically added it in the amended Section 15 – Hence, now both the storage or the possession of any child pornographic material would be liable to be punished when done with any of the specified intention thereunder. [Para 112] Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s.15 – ‘storage’; ‘possession’ of child pornographic material – To constitute offence u/s.15, ‘storage’ and ‘possession’ not to continue to be there at the time of registration of FIR: Held: Section 15 does not fixate any particularly time-frame – What is simpliciter required to constitute an offence under Section 15 of the POCSO is the establishment of ‘storage’ or ‘possession’ of any child pornographic material with the specified intention under sub-section(s) (1), (2) or (3), at any relevant point of time – Thus, an offence can be made out under Section 15 even if the said ‘storage’ or ‘possession’ no longer exists at the time of registration of the FIR, if it is established that the person accused had ‘stored’ or ‘possessed’ of any child pornographic material with the specified intention at any particular point of time even if it is anterior in time.
