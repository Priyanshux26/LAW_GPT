It is their contention F that they were forced to make the payment. As such, their custodial interrogation is not warranted. 17. However, it may be noted that a perusal of Sections 39 and 40 of the said Act, as have been interpreted by this Court, would show that a prima facie satisfaction has to be arrived that the acts which are G committed by the accused have been committed with intention to further the activity of a terrorist organization. 18. A perusal of Sections 39 and 40 of the said Act would itself reveal, that for an act to constitute as an offence within the meaning of that Section, it has to be done with the intention of furthering the H 530 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A activities. This Court, in the case of Thwaha Fasal (supra), while considering the provisions of Section 39 of the said Act, has also taken a similar view. 19. The learned Special Judge has himself distinguished cases of the persons who have indulged into extortion for furthering the activities B of the organization and the persons like the present appellants, who were government servants, and compelled to contribute the amount. We, therefore, find that it cannot be said that the prima facie opinion, as expressed by the learned Special Judge, could be said to be perverse or impossible. C 20. An interference by an Appellate Court and particularly in a matter when liberty granted to a citizen was being taken away would be warranted only in the event the view taken by the Trial Court was either perverse or impossible. On this limited ground, we find that the appeals deserve to be allowed. 21. Therefore, the impugned s are quashed and set aside D and the appeals are allowed. 22. However, it is made clear that any observation made hereinabove shall not be construed an expression on the merits of the matter. E 23. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
