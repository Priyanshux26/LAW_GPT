5. The revenue, in its return, resisted the claim and urged that the assessee engaged itself in the business of manufacturing and selling HR G strips, sections, and pipes and effected intra-state and inter-state sales. For AY 2005-06 to 2008-09, it was issued with show cause notice in Form VAT 305A on 06.06.2009 proposing to raise a demand of ` 1,86,80,708/-. Objections were called for, from the assessee which 2 Dated 18.06.2018, 16.07.2018, 23.08.2018, 24.10.2018, 05.03.2019, 18.06.2019, H and 04.11.2019. THE COMMERCIAL TAX OFFICER & ORS. v. NEERAJA PIPES 929 PVT. LTD. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] were not filed till 06.07.2009. Consequently, assessment s were A passed on 07.07.2009 confirming the tax demand as proposed in the show cause notice. This assessment was challenged before the High Court in a writ petition3; which was disposed of by the court on 15.04.2010 permitting the assessee to file objection to the notice in VAT 305A dated 06.06.2009 within a period of six weeks from the date, on B the condition that the assessee deposited ` 20 lakhs within four weeks from 15.04.2010. However, no deposit of the amount within the period specified was made; the assessee also did not file its objections to the show cause notice, as directed by the court. As a result, the revenue issued proceedings dated 31.03.2011 confirming the demand of tax in a sum of ` 1,86,80,708/- as arrived at by assessment dated C 07.07.2009. The revenue alleged that the said proceeding was served on one Mr. Pankaj Agarwal, Director of the company on 31.03.2011 itself, which was duly acknowledged. 6. The revenue further contended that similarly for AYs 2009-10 and 2010-11, assessments under VAT Act were finalized raising a demand D of ` 2,38,84,812/- and ` 1,21,83,884/-. Since the assessee did not pay the tax due in the normal course, an urgent notice dated 14.06.2011 was issued for payment of ` 5,50,58,758/- which included the arrears of tax payable for the earlier period i.e., 2005-06 to 2008-09. It was claimed that this urgent notice was served on Mr. Neeraj Agarwal, one of the E Directors of the assessee company on the same day. The arrears shown as due, were not paid, resulting in a demand notice in Form IV dated 12.09.2011 under the RR Act, before attaching the assessee’s properties. Since there was no response, or compliance, an attachment dated 03.02.2012 in Form V under the RR Act was issued. Even then the assessee did not approach the revenue to seek any relief and instead F remained silent. 7. The revenue also urged that it became aware that the assessee’s banker, Canara Bank, had issued a notification on 14.08.2011 bringing its immovable properties for sale in public auction to recover the loans extended to it. Under provisions of Section 25 and 26 of VAT Act, the G tax arrears have a priority over the dues of the bank. They provide for first charge over the properties of the VAT dealer. Therefore, the revenue requested the petitioner’s banker not to proceed with sale of the property, pursuant to the notification dated 14.08.2011 and also requested it to 3 W.P.
