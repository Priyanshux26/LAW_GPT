Therefore, also, the Proviso to Section 10(26AAA) insofar as it excludes from the exempted category “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” has to be struck down. Therefore, Proviso to Section B 10(26AAA) inasmuch as it excludes from the provision of exemption a Sikkimese woman merely because she marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008 is totally discriminatory and violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India, which requires to be struck down.

Manohar Singhji II [1954] SCR 996 and Shayara Bano v.Union of India (2017) 9 SCC 1 : [2017] 9 SCR 797 - followed. G. Sekar v. Geetha & Ors. (2009) 6 SCC 99 : [2009] 5 D SCR 1005- relied on. Vishundas Hundumal v. State of M.P. (1981) 2 SCC 410: [1981] 3 SCR 234 and Anuj Garg & Ors. v. Hotel Association of India & Ors. (2008) 3 SCC 1: [2007] 12 SCR 991- referred to. E per B. V. Nagarathna, J. 1. Under the Sikkim Subjects Regulations, 1961, as far as women are concerned, marriage has been the basis of acquiring the status of having a domicile in Sikkim and being a Sikkim Subject or losing domicile or status as a Sikkim Subject. Marriage of a Sikkimese woman is also the basis for discrimination against F her whereas there is no such discrimination vis-à-vis a Sikkimese man marrying a Sikkimese or a non-Sikkimese woman on or after 1st April, 2008. When the Explanation to Clause 26AAA to Section 10 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 refers to an “individual”, it includes both Sikkimese men and women, in fact, all genders; it G cannot have a restrictive or myopic reference to only Sikkimese men and exclude those Sikkimese women covered under the proviso. A proviso cannot over arch a provision. But in the instant case, the proviso to Section 10(26AAA) of the Act, 1961 is overriding the provision as well as the Explanation in respect of those categories of married Sikkimese women referred to in the H proviso which is impermissible. Thus, the proviso is inherently ASSOCIATION OF OLD SETTLERS OF SIKKIM AND ORS. v. 295 UNION OF INDIA AND ANR. arbitrary and discriminatory against a particular category of A Sikkimese women. In other words, the Explanation to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 includes both Sikkimese men as well as women. Such being the interpretation, the proviso is antithetical to the Explanation and the Section as well. The expression “an individual” in the Explanation to Section 10 B (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961, must include all genders including Sikkimese women. There cannot be a discrimination only on the ground of sex and race. Hence, all Sikkimese women are entitled to the benefit of Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961, as per the Explanation thereto irrespective of whether they marry a Sikkimese or a non-Sikkimese.
