[Paras 15, 16] Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s. 138 – Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act, 2003 – Proceedings under N.I. Act – Interest rates not in conformity with the 2003 Act – Appropriate forum: Held: The reasoning given by the Appellate Court, having taken note of the Tamil Nadu Act, fails to appreciate that even going by what has been written on the pronote i.e., 1.8% per month would lead to the interest being 21.6% per annum, which also is above the cap of 12% per annum prescribed in the Tamil Nadu Act – Thus, if the parties amongst themselves, agreed to a rate which is not in conformity with the Tamil Nadu Act, it was for the respondent to raise an objection or move the appropriate forum 324 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports for getting the same corrected/taken care of, so that the interest rate did not exceed 1% per month but having agreed to a rate of 1.8% per month, the subsequent amount of interest calculated @ 3% per month does not have much force for it was upon the respondent to challenge the rate of interest – The respondent also cannot be said to be a layman, and being a subscriber to a chitfund company, he is expected to be aware of the laws and also of what is beneficial for him – Having issued the pronotes, he cannot now take a plea in these collateral proceedings under the N.I. Act to contend that the rate of interest was more than what was permissible under the Tamil Nadu Act.
