Sub-classification would violate the provision only when either preference or exclusive benefit is provided to certain castes or groups of the Scheduled Castes over all the seats reserved for the class; e. Historical and empirical evidence demonstrates that the Scheduled Castes are a socially heterogenous class. Thus, the State in exercise of the power under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) can further classify the Scheduled Castes if (a) there is a rational principle for differentiation; and (b) the rational principle has a nexus with the purpose of sub-classification; and f. The holding in Chinnaiah (supra) that sub-classification of the Scheduled Castes is impermissible is overruled. The scope of sub-classification of the Scheduled Castes is summarized below: i. The objective of any form of affirmative action including sub-classification is to provide substantive equality of opportunity for the backward classes. The State can sub- classify, inter alia, based on inadequate representation of certain castes. However, the State must establish that the inadequacy of representation of a caste/group is because of its backwardness; ii. The State must collect data on the inadequacy of representation in the “services of the State” because it is used as an indicator of backwardness; and iii. Article 335 of the Constitution is not a limitation on the exercise of power under Articles 16(1) and 16(4). Rather, it is a restatement of the necessity of considering the claims of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in public services. Efficiency of administration must be viewed in a manner which promotes inclusion and equality as required by Article 16(1). 206.
