In any case, the transactions have been made through the BSE and NSE. As such, the contention in that regard is without substance. In any case, a specific finding has been given D by the Arbitrator in that regard. The said arbitral award is under challenge in the proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. The complainant/respondent No.1 has attempted to turn a purely contractual dispute between the parties into a criminal case. Not only that, there is an inordinate delay in lodging the complaint. Though the complainant/respondent No.1 was aware E about the sale of the shares in the year 2001, it did not do anything except filing an application before the Arbitrator. According to the complainant/respondent No.1, it received the information from the BSE and NSE in the year 2006, which fortified its suspicion about the fraud being played. Even thereafter, for a period of 5 F years, it was silent and filed the complaint only in the year 2011. The complaint, taken at its face value, does not disclose that any of the ingredients of the offence complained of have been made out. The present complaint is nothing else but an abuse of process of law. The impugned passed by the High Court and the passed by the trial court are quashed and set aside. G The complaint filed before the trial court under Section 403, 406, 420 and 120B of the IPC is dismissed.
