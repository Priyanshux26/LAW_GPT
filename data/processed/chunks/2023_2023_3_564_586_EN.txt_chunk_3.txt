At this stage, such G decision is required to be treated as the “decree”. The consequential action of preparing the instrument of partition as contemplated in Section 121 of the Land Revenue Act would be only ministerial or administrative act to be carried out to completely dispose of the partition case instituted before the H 568 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A Revenue Officer. Hence, once the decision on the property to be divided and on the mode of partition is taken by the Revenue Officer under Section 118, the joint status of the parties would stand severed on the date of such decision, subject to the decision in appeal if any preferred by the party. The consequential action of drawing an instrument of partition would follow thereafter. B Hence, merely because the instrument of partition was not drawn, it could not be said that the partition was not completed or that the joint status of the parties was not severed. [Para 30][584-G; 585-A-C] 1.7 In the present case, the Assistant Collector i.e., C concerned Revenue Officer vide the dated 25.05.1982 had rejected the objections raised by the plaintiff and others with regard to the mode of partition and had confirmed the mode of partition accordingly. On that day, the “Naksha Be” was already annexed to the file and the case was listed on 31.05.1982 for D hearing the objections as to the “Naksha Be”. On 31.07.1982, the Assistant Collector passed the stating inter alia that the Patwari and Kanungo were present, and they had explained the parties about the passage and the boundaries of the plots, and that as per “Naksha Be”, the partition was accepted. The details of the number of khasras allotted to both the parties i.e., E to defendant and others and to plaintiff were also mentioned in the said . The partition having been accepted as per the said “Naksha Be”, the joint status of the parties had stood severed. Of course, the said dated 31.07.1982 was challenged by the plaintiff by way of an appeal before the Collector F who vide the dated 12.10.1982 had dismissed the same. The said of Collector was further challenged by the said plaintiff by filing revision application before the Commissioner. Though, the Commissioner had initially granted stay against the operation of the dated 31.07.1982 upto 16.11.1982, admittedly the said stay was not further extended thereafter. G Under the circumstances, the joint status of the parties had come to an end on 31.07.1982, when the Assistant Collector passed the and when the same was confirmed by the Collector on 19.10.1982. The trial court and the appellate court, under the circumstances, had rightly held that the plaintiff did not possess H the status of co-sharer on the date of decree i.e., on 01.12.1982, JHABBAR SINGH (DECEASED) THROUGH LEGAL HEIRS v. 569 JAGTAR SINGH S/O DARSHAN SINGH and that his right of pre-emption had not survived till the date of A passing of the decree in the suits. The High Court grossly erred in misinterpreting the provisions of Punjab Pre-emption Act and of Land Revenue Act, and in setting aside the s and decrees passed by the trial court and the appellate court.
