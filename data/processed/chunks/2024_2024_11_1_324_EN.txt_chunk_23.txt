The reference to this Constitution Bench raises significant questions about Articles 39(b) and 31-C of the Constitution. Answering the reference has been an adventure through the intricacies of constitutional interpretation and the annals of constitutional history. However, an interpretation of these provisions must involve an understanding of not only their historical context but also the social and economic values which guide the present and are likely to guide the future. Directive Principles of State Policy1 such as Article 39(b) and safe harbour provisions such as Article 31-C are unique creations of our Constitution. Understanding them is a delicate task 1 “Directive Principles” [2024] 11 S.C.R. 33 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. that involves balancing competing yet coexistent values embedded in our Constitution – the recognition of the individual rights of all citizens and an aspiration towards a welfare state which secures socio-economic justice. 2. Before proceeding, it would be appropriate to briefly refer to the provisions of the Constitution which form the heart of the reference and controversy before this Court.
