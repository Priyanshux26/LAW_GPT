Aggrieved by the of the Commissioner, the appellant filed a first appeal bearing number 112 of 2016 before the High Court under Section 30 of the 1923 Act. The thrust of the submissions before the High Court was that the definition of “workman” as per Section 2 (n) of the 1923 Act excludes any person working in the capacity of a member of the Armed Forces of the Union, therefore, since Section 3 of the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957 (in short, “the 1957 Act”) declared the RPF as an Armed Force of the Union, the deceased being a constable in the RPF would not be a workman within the meaning of section 2 (n) of the 1923 Act; hence, claim petition under the 1923 Act was not maintainable. 5. The aforesaid plea raised by the appellant was not accepted by the High Court and the appeal was dismissed. 6. Aggrieved by the and of the High Court, this appeal has been preferred. 7. We have heard Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee, learned ASG assisted by Mr. Shubhendu Anand and Mr. Rajan Kr. Chourasia for the appellant and Ms. Prerana Chaturvedi for the respondents. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 8. On behalf of the appellant, it was submitted that the deceased was indisputably a member of the RPF which, as per Section 3 of the 1957 Act, is an Armed Force of the Union. Section 2 (n) of the 1923 Act defines a workman. By clause clause (n) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 1923 Act, though workman, inter alia, means a railway servant as defined in Section 2 (34) of the 1989 Act, any person working in the capacity of a member of the Armed Forces of the Union is excluded. Therefore, as, by virtue of Section 3 of the 1957 Act, the deceased was part of the Armed Forces of the Union, he was not a workman within the meaning of Section 2 (1)(n) of the 1923 Act and, in view thereof, the claim petition was not maintainable under the 1923 Act. 9. In addition to the above, it was argued that the deceased was not an employee specifically covered by any of the Entries in Schedule II of the 1923 Act, therefore, he cannot be treated as a workman under 2(1) (n) of the 1923 Act. It was pointed out that Entries (i), (xii) and (xiii) of COMMANDING OFFICER, RAILWAY PROTECTION SPECIAL FORCE, 665 MUMBAI v. BHAVNABEN DINSHBHAI BHABHOR & OTHERS [MANOJ MISRA, J.] Schedule II refers to employees of the Railways but a constable in the RPF is conspicuous by its absence there. According to the counsel for the appellant, unless an employee falls in any of the entries specified in Schedule II of the 1923 Act he cannot be considered a workman.
