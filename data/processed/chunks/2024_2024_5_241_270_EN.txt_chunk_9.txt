The state government can impose the duty at such rate that is prescribed by the Parliament. He has also argued that Entry 44 of List III is a taxation provision, as has been clearly held in Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh v. State of Uttar Pradesh19. 6.1 Dr. Manish Singhvi further submits that the 1952 Act applies since the period of levy is for policies issued between 1993-94 to 2001-02, which is prior to the 1998 Act coming into force (on 27.05.2004). The 1952 Act received Presidential assent and hence prevailed over the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 in the state as per Article 254(2). Section 3(vi) of this Act adopts the Schedule from the central Act for the purpose of rate of stamp duty. Hence, the stamp duty must be paid to the state government for insurance transactions occurring within the territory of the state after the 1952 Act came into force as per the rate prescribed in entry 47 of Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act. Alternatively, he has argued that even if the 1998 Act applies, Sections 90 and 91 of that Act have the effect of adopting the Indian Stamp Act with respect to instruments contained in Entry 91 of List I. Lastly, he has differentiated the present case from VVS Rama Sharma (supra) as that case 19 [1973] 2 SCR 1073 : (1973) 1 SCC 261 254 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports pertained to the registration of a criminal case against the officers of LIC for non-payment of stamp duty and the lack of criminal intent, leading to the quashing of FIR. 7. Issues: Having heard the learned ASG for the appellant and Dr. Manish Singhvi for the respondent, the following issues arise for our consideration: I. Whether the 1952 Act or the 1998 Act applies to the facts of the present case? II. Whether the state government has the legislative competence to impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance as per Entry 91 of List I read with Entry 44 of List III? III. Whether the 1952 Act requires the purchase of insurance stamps from and payment of stamp duty to the Rajasthan government for insurance policies issued within the state? IV. Whether, in the facts of the present case, the appellant is liable to pay stamp duty? I. Applicable Law 8. It is first important to determine whether stamp duty in the present case can be imposed under the 1952 Act or the 1998 Act. The High Court has relied on the provisions of the 1952 Act while arriving at its conclusion. We agree with the High Court on this aspect as the stamp duty must be levied as per the law in force as on the date of execution of the instrument.20 In the present case, the insurance policies were issued between 1993-94 to 2001-02. Section 3 of the 1998 Act21, which is the charging provision, imposes stamp duty on every instrument mentioned in the Schedule that is executed in the state on or after the date of commencement of the Act.
