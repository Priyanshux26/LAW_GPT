18. Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963 is corresponding to Article 142 of the Limitation Act, 1908, wherein it is stated that the plaintiff who based his case on title has to prove not only title, but also possession within 12 years of the date of suit. The said Article has undergone a metamorphic change in view of Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963. The vital distinction between Articles 142 of the Limitation Act, 1908 and Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963 is that as per Article 142 of 1908 Act, the plaintiff has to prove not only title, but also possession within 12 years of the date of suit, whereas, as per Article 65 of 1963 Act, a suit for possession based on title has to be filed within 12 years when possession becomes adverse to the concerned plaintiff. 19. Article 113 reads as follows: “Description of Period of Time from which application Limitation period begins to run Any suit for Three years When the right to which no period sue accrues.” of limitation is provided elsewhere in this Schedule. It means, if no prescribed period of limitation is provided elsewhere in the Limitation Act, 1963, as per Article 113 of the said Act, a suit [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1901 Mallavva and Anr. v. Kalsammanavara Kalamma (Since Dead) by Legal Heirs & Ors. must be instituted within a period of 3 years when the right to sue accrues. 20. From the conjoint reading of the said Sections and Articles of the Limitation Act, 1963, the Court has to find out as to whether the reliefs sought for in the present suit would come within the contour of Article 58 or any other Article of Limitation Act, 1963. 21. Article 58 comes within the purview of Part-Ill of Limitation Act, 1963 and the same deals with suits relating to declarations. 22. The chronology of the following events is important: i. The original suit was instituted in the year 2011 ii. The suit came to be dismissed on 6.09.2014 iii. First appeal was filed on 30.10.2014. iv. An application seeking amendment of plaint was filed along with first appeal on 30.10.2014. v. The application seeking amendment of plaint with a view to add the prayer for recovery of possession was allowed vide dated 22.06.2018. vi. The Regular appeal came to be allowed on 27.10.2018. AMENDMENT OF PLAINT AT THE STAGE OF FIRST APPEAL 23. It is well settled that rules of procedure are intended to be a handmaid to the administration of justice. A party cannot be refused just relief merely because of some mistake, negligence, inadvertence or even infraction of rules of procedure. The court always gives relief to amend the pleading of the party, unless it is satisfied that the party applying was acting mala fide or that by his blunder, he had caused injury to his opponent which cannot be compensated for by an of cost.
