[K. M. JOSEPH, J.] adjudicatory power it may not be open to the Commission by using the A nomenclature regulation to usurp this power to disregard the terms of the contract. (97) Another argument which has been raised on behalf of the first respondent is that the guidelines were framed on 19.01.2005. Clauses 4.7 and 5.17 came to be, however, modified before the PPA was entered B into and even prior to the RFP and therefore, the PPA and Article 17.3 therein has been cast in the widest terms. (98) We have already perused Article 17.3.1. Article 17.3 to begin with, speaks of specific instances which can trigger the dispute resolution mechanism. A case in point and close to facts is a dispute arising from a C change in law, after a claim is denied and a resolution through settlement not being arrived at. There are other specific clauses which are part of the PPA which are adverted to in the later part of Article 17.3.1. Therefore, the argument is raised on behalf of the first respondent that the opening words of Article 17.3.1 are designedly broad to cater to situations such as are represented by the facts of this case. In other D words, even irrespective of a situation being not governed by Article 13.1 in that the restitutionary principle or the principle of an incomplete contract leading to a lifelong regulation assuring a fair return to the seller is observed, the power of revisiting of the rates is what is contemplated in the amended guideline which finds enshrinement in E Article 17.3.1., it is contended. (99) In fact, when we notice the PPA, we find that apart from matters which are expressly referred to in Article 17.3.1, viz., Articles 4.7.1, Article 13.2, Article 18.1 or clause 10.1.3 of Schedule 17, there are other Articles in the PPA with which Article 17.3.1 can bear nexus with. They include apparently, Articles 4.5.2, 11.6.6 and 11.6.7. This is F besides 12.7(e) which relates to enforcement of claims under Force Majeure. Therefore, it is not as if Article 17.3.1 is not to be understood without reference to the other parts of the contract. No Court should attempt to read a part of the contract in isolation. The draftsman of a contract of the nature we are dealing with would have not left any stone G unturned in making the contract one to be construed with a great sense of harmony and care. Therefore, we do not accept the contention of the first respondent that the Commission, Tribunal and this Court must pour in meaning into the opening words of Article 17.3.1 so that in the facts, the first respondent can claim compensation on the basis that it has incurred expenditure acting on the first WAPCOS report.

A (100) Here, we must notice finally, that substantially, the claim in regard to the water intake system was founded on the reliance placed on the first WAPCOS report and on the strength of the second WAPCOS report.
