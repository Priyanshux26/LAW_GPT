The I.O. has admitted that he did not make investigation as to how accused C No.1 (since deceased) had received injuries. It is the specific defence taken by accused No.1 (since deceased) that while he was lying on the bed in his room, two persons entered his room and one of them gave a lathi blow on his head as a result of which he started bleeding and became unconscious because of the fracture. [Paras 16 and 17][382-D-G; 383-A-B] D 3. From the materials placed on record, it appears that the prosecution has not come with clean hands and has attempted to suppress the genesis of the incident. There are contradictions in the dying declaration as well as in the evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.2 as to in what circumstances the deceased ‘J’ and ‘M’ went to the E house of the accused persons. The prosecution has failed to explain the injury sustained by accused No.1 (since deceased). It is the specific case of the accused No.1 (since deceased) that two persons had come to his house and they assaulted him with a lathi. The possibility that the accused persons enraged by the assault on accused No.1 (since deceased) whilst deprived of the F power of self control, by grave and sudden provocation, attacked the deceased-‘J’ and ‘M’ resulting in their death cannot be ruled out. The appellants are entitled to benefit of doubt in view of Exception I of Section 300 of the RPC. As such, the prosecution has failed to prove the case under Section 302 of the RPC beyond G reasonable doubt. The conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellants under Section 302 RPC is converted to the one under Part-I of Section 304 of the RPC.
