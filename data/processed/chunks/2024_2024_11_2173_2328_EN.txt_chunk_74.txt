In Tata Cellular v. Union of India,265 this Court held that contractual decisions of government and its instrumentalities “must be free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated by mala fides.” In a public-private contract, the state must act fairly, justly, and reasonably.266 When a state acts contrary to the public good or public interest, it acts contrary to Article 14.267 147. In ICOMM Tele Ltd. v. Punjab State Water Supply and Sewerage Board,268 this Court had to adjudicate on the validity of a pre-deposit arbitral clause in a public-private contract. According to the pre- deposit clause, a party invoking arbitration was required to furnish a “deposit-at-call” for ten percent of the amount claimed. To determine the validity of the clause from the viewpoint of arbitrariness, this Court held that a contractual clause would be arbitrary “which would be unfair and unjust and which no reasonable man would agree 261 Mahabir Auto Stores v.

From the above, it is clear that when an instrumentality of the State acts contrary to public good and public interest, unfairly, unjustly and unreasonably, in its contractual, constitutional or statutory obligations, it really acts contrary to the constitutional guarantee found in Article 14 of the Constitution.”] 268 (2019) 4 SCC 401 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2267 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company to.”269 This Court termed the pre-deposit clause to be violative of Article 14 for being excessive and disproportionate. Importantly, the Court held that the pre-deposit requirement was contrary to the object of arbitration because it served as a deterrent for a party to invoke arbitration.270 The pre-deposit clause was termed arbitrary for defeating the purpose of arbitration. 148. In Lombardi (supra), a decision of a three-Judge Bench of this Court, a term of contract mandated “the party initiating the arbitration claim […] to deposit 7% of the arbitration claim in the shape of fixed deposit receipt as security deposit” in a public-private arbitration agreement. This Court observed that an arbitration agreement has to comply with the “operation of law”, which includes the grundnorm. It was observed that the layers of grundnorm in the context of an arbitration agreement include (i) the Constitution of India; (ii) the Arbitration Act and any other Central and State law; and (iii) the arbitration agreement entered into by the parties under Section 7 of the Arbitration Act.271 Further, this Court observed that party autonomy “cannot be stretched to an extent where it violates the fundamental rights under the Constitution.”272 It was concluded that the pre-deposit clause violated Article 14 of the Constitution.
