Impugning the bona-fi des of the appellant, it was argued that he had discovered HIV infection in the year 2014 itself but approached the Commission only in 2017 and the appellant had symptoms of immunodefi ciency during 2002 and 2014. Yet he has attempted to conceal those facts at earlier stages. It was further argued that it was not possible for the appellant to remain asymptomatic for a period of 12 years after being infused with the virus specially when an infection is transmitted through blood transfusion as in such cases, viral load is greater and disease manifests comparatively early. 42. It was submitted that HIV can be caused because of various reasons, such as unprotected sexual intercourse with an HIV infected person; blood transfusion; sharing of HIV infected needles; transfer of HIV virus by 37 Forwarding of personal application 741570-B CPL AK Chauhan ADSO in Letter no. SWAC/S1276/1/AD, dated 24.5.2016. 624 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. infected mother to her baby before birth, or after birth, by breastfeeding. In the facts of this case, the appellant did not establish any defi nite causal relationship between infection in 2002 and his acquiring HIV positive status in 2014 as a direct and only result of his being admitted and given the blood transfusion in 171 MH. The records reveal that the appellant was referred to 171 MH in 2002 as he was affl icted with microcytic anemia; loss of appetite, discoloration of urine, 5 kg weight loss in 5 months, fever and dyspepsia. When admitted in February 2014, at MH Ahmedabad, the appellant was suff ering from conditions such as H1N1 virus (swine fl u); macrocytic anemia; subhyalodid hemorrhage. The eff ect of transfusion in 2002 led to considerable improvement in the appellant’s overall medical condition. It was submitted that during the CoI, the concerned pathologist of 166 MH at the relevant time, produced records showing that two units of B-negative blood were indented to 171 MH on 12.01.2002. No records showing blood units given to 171 MH for June- July 2002 were available. Therefore, at best, there was no evidence which could establish to any extent that HIV infected blood was transfused. In these circumstances, there is no question of negligence by the respondents or vicarious liability for their negligence of the IAF or the Indian Army. VI. ANALYSIS (i) Jurisdiction (a) Is appellant’s case covered under CPA 1986: 43. The fi rst question that the court has to consider is whether the appellant’s case is under the CPA 1986. The respondents contend that the appellant cannot claim to be a consumer, and the medical facilities extended to him, through the IAF and army hospitals, do not fall within the ambit of the CPA 1986, because all armed force personnel are required, as part of their duties, to show fi tness, and are subjected to periodic mandatory medical tests. The terms and conditions of engagement of armed forces personnel, and the army/IAF ecosystem are geared to ensure the fi tness and sound medical shape of its personnel.
