Digital Supreme Court Reports the promisor’s contract to the extent of the assets of the deceased falling in their hands – But they are not personally liable under the contracts of the deceased and are also not liable for personal contracts of the deceased – When personal considerations are the basis of a contract they come to an end on the death of either party, unless there is a stipulation express or implied to the contrary – This is especially so when the contracts involve exercise of special skills such as expressed in s.40, Contract Act – A contract involving exercise of individual’s skills or expertise of the promisor or which depends upon his/her personal qualification or competency, the promisor has to perform the contract by himself and not by his/her representatives – s.2(11), CPC defines a “legal representative – Legal representatives of a deceased are liable only to the extent of the estate which they inherit – Where the decree or is not against the estate of a deceased sole proprietor but based on the skills and expertise of the sole proprietor, the obligations which had to be performed by the sole proprietor would come to an end on his demise and the same cannot be imposed on his legal heirs or representatives – Such a position is distinguished from a position where the estate of the deceased sole proprietor would become liable to satisfy the decree in monetary terms as a proprietorship firm is not a separate legal entity as compared to the proprietor and his estate would become liable only to satisfy a decree or an in monetary terms on his demise – In the case of a personal obligation imposed on a person under the contract and on the demise of such person, his estate does not become liable and therefore, the legal representatives who represent the estate of a deceased would obviously not be liable and cannot be directed to discharge the contractual obligations of the deceased – Legal representatives of the deceased opposite party-appellants not liable to discharge the obligation which had to be discharged by the deceased opposite party in his personal capacity and hence that portion of the impugned s of the NCDRC, State Commission and District Forum are set aside.
