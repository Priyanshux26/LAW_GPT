With this, came the rehabilitation and re-establishment of Sheikh Abdullah as the Chief Minister of Jammu & Kashmir, with the then Chief Minister Syed Mir Qasim stepping down.65 This was with the support of the Congress Party, which had a majority in the Jammu and Kashmir State Assembly, on the understanding that fresh elections would be held soon.66 30. The political stability, however, did not last long with the imposition of the 1975 Emergency. When the Congress Party lost the 1977 Lok Sabha elections, support was withdrawn from Jammu & Kashmir. This led to the fall of Sheikh Abdullah’s Government in March 1977 and imposition of Governor’s Rule.67 However, Sheikh Abdullah’s National Conference came back into power in the 1977 state elections.68 65 David E.

God and nature have been very kind to the Kashmir Valley. Unfortunately, the human species has not been so considerate. The 1980s saw some troubled times culminating in the 1987 elections, which saw allegations and counter-allegations.69 There was a growth of fundamentalism fueled from across the b. The 1971 creation of Bangladesh was not forgotten. Unemployed and frustrated youth were trained as militia and were sent back into Kashmir to create chaos. It was a major change for people who, irrespective of faith, were known for peace and tolerance. The Kashmiri Shaivism and Islamic Sufi sm were taken over by such militant tendencies. Prior to this, what Sir Walter Lawrence wrote about the absence of crime against persons in Kashmir had held good.70 There was a mass exodus of the Kashmiri Pandit community, threatened for their life and property, changing the very cultural ethos of Kashmir. There has been little turn-back despite three decades on this issue. It was a proxy war on the territory of India with active support from across the b. 32. In to curtail the activities of terrorists, either from across the b, or indigenous, armed forces and paramilitary forces were brought in. The kidnapping of the daughter of the then Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, and her subsequent release in exchange for terrorists detained,71 lit the last match, which produced such unprecedented fi re that it engulfed the whole Valley. The bottom-line is that today’s generation aged 35 years or younger have not seen the cultural milieu of diff erent communities, which formed the very basis of the society in Kashmir.
