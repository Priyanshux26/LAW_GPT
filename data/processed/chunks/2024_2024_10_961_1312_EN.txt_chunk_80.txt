Therefore, rather than enforcing a fixed procrustean notion of equality, Article 14 permits the legislature to classify individuals into different groups and apply distinct norms accordingly. 169. While the legislation can indeed classify persons into different groups and apply distinct standards, such classification must be reasonable. This Court has acknowledged that the precise parameters of what constitutes ‘reasonable’ has not been firmly established, 120 Special Courts Bill, 1978, In re (1979) 1 SCC 380, para 72. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1077 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 and there is no single test to determine the reasonableness of a classification.121 However, while there is no straitjacket formula to determine reasonableness, certain yardsticks can be used to evaluate it, broadly categorized into the form and object of the classification. Yardsticks to check the reasonableness of classification 170. In terms of the form, the classification should not be based on arbitrary criteria and must instead be based on a logic which distinguishes individuals with similar characteristics i.e., the equals from the persons who do not share those characteristics—the unequals. Apart from requiring such differentia, this prong requires that the classification must be intelligible, such that it can be reasonably understood whether an element falls in one class or another.122 If the class is so poorly defined that one cannot reasonably understand its constituents, it will fail this test of ‘intelligible’ differentia. Therefore, instead of being based on arbitrary selection, the classification must be supported by valid and lawful reasons.123 171. Hence, using an intelligible criterion, the classes must be constituted in a manner that distinguishes the components of that class from the elements that have been left out of the class. This is instantiated by State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas,124 where a 7-judge bench was dealing with the challenge of exemption granted to Scheduled Castes from the departmental test required for promotion. The Court held that the same was based on intelligible differentia, as the persons belonging to the exempted class, i.e., the Scheduled Caste, differed from those excluded from this class. 172. At this juncture, it is essential to raise the question that if every person or object shares similarities and differences with others in numerous ways, how do we determine whether they are similar enough to be categorized together? To put this into context using an oft-quoted example–assume a law is enacted to create two classes of vehicles, one allowed inside the park and another prohibited.125 In this scenario, a motorcycle is similar to a child’s bicycle in that both 121 Transport & Dock Workers Union v.
