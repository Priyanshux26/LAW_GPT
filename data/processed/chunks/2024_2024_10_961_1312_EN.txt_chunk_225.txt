However, members of Parliament felt that the enactment must only cover those who migrate for “economical” reasons and not refugees who migrate because of civil disturbance caused due to the political instability in the aftermath of the partition.82 The Parliamentary debates on the Bill elucidate that: (a) there were more migrants from Bangladesh because of the absence of a permit system for travel between East Pakistan and India; and (b) the influx was most profound in the Indian State of Assam compared to the other bing states. It is crucial to note that the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act 1950 was enacted because the Foreigners Act did not include immigrants from Pakistan.83 55. The provisions of the Foreigners Act before the amendment in 1957 and the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act 1950 indicate the lenient policy of India towards the refugees of West and East Pakistan in the aftermath of the partition of India. This must be read along with the legal regime governing citizenship in India upon the enactment of the Citizenship Act 1955 that permitted the registration of migrants from East and West Pakistan as citizens. 56. However, the huge influx of migrants from East Pakistan to Assam was not receding. On 25 December 1983, the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act 198384 came into force. The preamble to the Act stated that the Act provided for the establishment of Tribunals to determine illegal immigrants. The Act was deemed to have come into force in Assam on 15 October 1983 and in any other State on such date as 82 Shri RK Choudhuri (Assam), Parliamentary Debates: Official Report (Volume 1, 1950), 318 83 See the response of Shri Gopalaswami to the question from Dr Deshmukh, Parliamentary Debates: Official Report (Volume 1, 1950), 336 84 “IMDT Act” 1274 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports may be notified by Central Government.85 Thus, unlike the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act 1950, the IMDT Act applied to the whole of India. Section 3(c) of the IMDT Act defined an illegal migrant as a person who has satisfied each of the following criteria (a) entered India on or after 25 March 1971; (b) is a foreigner; and (c) entered India without being in possession of a valid passport or other travel document or any other lawful authority. The date on which a person becomes an illegal immigrant according to the IMDT Act, that is 25 March 1971 is the same as the date prescribed in Section 6A of the Citizenship Act for acquiring citizenship. Section 4 gave the IMDT Act overriding effect notwithstanding anything in the Passport (Entry into India) Act 1920, the Foreigners Act 1946, the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act 1950 or the Passports Act 1967. In terms of Section 1, the Act applies to the whole of India. The Central Government in exercise of the power under Section 1 of the Act, however, did not enforce the Act in any other Indian State. The special provisions in the form of the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act 1950 and the IMDT Act clearly elucidate that the huge influx of migrants from Bangladesh to Assam has always been a ‘cause for concern’ and Parliament has taken steps to address the issue previously.
