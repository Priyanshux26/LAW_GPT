The nineteen cases in this batch of appeals follow a similar pattern of facts. The supply of electricity was discontinued due to the F failure of the previous owners to pay the dues for consumption of electricity on the premises. The previous owners had borrowed money or raised loans on the security of their premises. In some cases, the erstwhile owner went into liquidation. The premises were sold in auction sales generally on an “as is where is” basis. The new owners, who G purchased the properties in auction, applied for new electricity connections for the premises to which electricity had been disconnected for failure to pay the dues. The Electric Utilities refused to provide an electricity connection unless the auction purchaser paid the dues of the previous owner. This refusal was derived from powers conferred under subordinate legislations, notifications, electricity Supply Codes or state regulations. H *Ed.
