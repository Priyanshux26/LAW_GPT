It seems that by the year 1895, MAO College had begun to experience considerable decline. It faced governmental pressure to increase student fees and make examinations more difficult, leading to a decrease in student enrolment and endowments.53 The death of Sir Syed in 1898 further intensified the situation, creating a sense of distrust among the benefactors of the college and a power vacuum.54 42. History further suggests that in 1898, the Sir Syed Memorial Fund was created with the goal of raising funds to pay off the debts of the College and to create an endowment to establish a university. The then Lieutenant Governor of the North-Western Provinces is said to have promised aid and support in the management of the College, provided that there was a stable governing body for the same directly under government supervision. The record further indicates that, by 1903, the fund collection drive had raised enough money to meet the College’s needs and restore its stability.55 43. At the ‘All India Muhammadan Educational Conference’ in Calcutta, the idea of establishing a university in Aligarh sparked significant deliberations and gained momentum. Some proposed a pan-India, affiliating university,56 while others advocated for a available at https://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Notification18012005.pdf; Ministry of Minority Affairs, S.O. 267(E) (Notified on 27 January, 2014) available at https://ncm.nic.in/legislations/ Gazette_JainInclusion_27Jan2014.pdf. 53 Theodore Beck, “The Principal’s Annual Report for 1898—99” (‘Principal’s Report), (1898—99), Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College Magazine (Aligarh) (MAOCM), and Aligarh Institute Gazette (Aligarh) (AIG), New Series VII, No. 11 (15 July 1899) (At this time the two journals were temporarily merged). 54 Shamim Akhtar, “Aligarh: From College to University” Proceedings of the Indian History Congress (2018-19) Vol. 79, pp. 623. 55 Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College Magazine (Aligarh) MAOCM, VII, (January 1899), pp. 15-21. 56 Rafiuddin Ahmad, ‘The Proposed Muslim University in India’, The Nineteenth Century, XLIV (1898), 915-21. 1778 [2024] 11 S.C.R.

However, nothing tangible happened on the ground level for multifarious reasons. In early 1910, efforts to establish a university at Aligarh resurfaced. Once the requisite funds had been collected, a committee was established to draft the constitution for the proposed university, designating the Viceroy as the chancellor and placing governance in the hands of a Muslim Court of Trustees. The matter of affiliation was cursorily mentioned only in the context of the powers of approval by various authorities. Finally, after long drawn-out negotiations between relevant stakeholders, in September 1920, the Aligarh Muslim University Act, 1920 (AMU Act, 1920) was passed by the Central Legislature of British India. C.1. Features of the AMU Act, 1920 45. The AMU Act, 1920 which came into force with effect from 29.07.1920, comprising 40 sections and 23 statutes, was a comprehensive piece of legislation that meticulously regulated various aspects of AMU. The Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the Act clearly articulated its purpose: “to incorporate this University, to indicate its functions, to create its governing bodies and to define their functions.” In essence, the AMU Act, 1920 was focused on establishing the University and making it operational by setting up its Governing Bodies and outlining their respective functions.
