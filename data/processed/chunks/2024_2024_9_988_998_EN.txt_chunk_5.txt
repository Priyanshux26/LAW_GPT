Later, directions were issued to deposit the arrears of rent and taxes after filing of eviction petition. Due to non-compliance, in a later proceeding, four weeks’ further time to comply with the previous s was allowed. In response, an affidavit was filed by respondent – tenant, wherein paragraph 3, details of deposit have been disclosed. Those details are relevant and reproduced as thus: - “3.

The respondent – tenant also filed an application (I.A. No. 61800 of 2020) seeking permission to bring additional documents on record. The documents annexed as R1 and R3 are the receipts of deposit of the rent from January 2019 to December 2019 and January 2020 to December 2020 in the case of Yashoda Devi and not related to this case. Document annexed as R2 relates to this case, whereby the respondent – tenant deposited the rent from October 2019 to March 2020 and Annexure R4 is the House Tax Receipt of ₹50,049/- deposited in compliance of the of this Court. 18. In this respect, appellant – landlord has also filed a document along with I.A. No. 11110 of 2020 indicating deficit rent of ₹28462.6 and Tax of ₹1912.68 @ 24% for a period of 75 months viz. from July 1995 to December 1995, January 1996 to December 1996, January 1997 to March 1997, April 2002 to March 2003, April 2003 to March 2004, October 2006 to September 2007, October 2008 to March 2009 and October 2009 to September 2010. In the said document, it is also specified that from October, 2001 to September, 2019, i.e., a total 216 months, the Tax has not been deposited, which comes to ₹19,673.28 and there is a total deficit of ₹50048.56. 19. On perusal of the affidavit and the documents referred hereinabove, it can safely be concluded that the rent from October 2011 to September 2012 was paid on 28.09.2012, hence, month to month rent was not paid during this period, and the default of respondent – tenant was there. Similarly, from October 2012 to September 2013, the rent was deposited on 21.03.2013, thus, default in payment of rent for October 2012 to March 2013 is clear. The rent from April 2014 to September 2014 was paid on 19.04.2014. It shows default of payment of rent for the month of April which was paid after 10th day of month.
