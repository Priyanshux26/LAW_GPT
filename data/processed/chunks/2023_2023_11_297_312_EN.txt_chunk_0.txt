[2023] 11 S.C.R. 297 : 2023 INSC 710 CASE DETAILS DHANRAJ N ASAWANI v. AMARJEETSINGH MOHINDERSINGH BASI AND OTHERS (Criminal Appeal No. 2093 of 2023) JULY 25, 2023 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y. CHANDRACHUD, CJI, J.B. PARDIWALA AND MANOJ MISRA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Whether the provisions of s.81(5B) of Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 can be construed as preventing a share holder of the society such as the appellant, who was also an erstwhile director, from independently setting the criminal law in motion. Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 – s.81(5B) – The High Court was of the view that since the provisions of the 1960 Act are special, the provisions of s.81(5B) would preclude the registration of an FIR at the behest of a person, such as the appellant, who is a shareholder of the co-operative society – Propriety of: Held: S.81 of the 1960 Act casts a public duty on the auditor and the Registrar to audit co-operative societies – A statutory obligation is cast on the auditor and the Registrar because they are the fi rst persons to acquire knowledge about the fi nancial irregularities in a co-operative society – S.81(5B) of the Act casts a positive obligation on the auditor or the Registrar to fi le an FIR – S.81(5B) demands accountability and vigilance from the auditor and the Registrar in performance of their public duty – It does not use any negative expression to prohibit persons other than the auditor or the Registrar from registering an FIR – Therefore, it would be contrary to basic principles of statutory construction to conclude that s.81(5B) debars persons other than the auditor or the Registrar from fi ling an FIR. [Paras 20 and 24] 297 298 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 – s.81(5B) – FIR registered by appellant-share holder against respondents for off ences punishable u/ss.420, 406, 409, 465, 467, 468 and 471 r/w. s.34 of IPC – FIR quashed by High Court relying on s.81(5B) of the 1960 Act – Propriety of: Held: The High Court held that s.81(5B) contains special provisions for the submission of a special report and the obtaining of the permission of the Registrar before the lodging of an FIR – It held that these provisions would be rendered otiose if the general provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 were to apply – In the instant circumstances, the High Court has erred in quashing the FIR which was lodged by the appellant – S.81(5B) cannot be interpreted to mean that any other person who comes to know about the fi nancial irregularity on the basis of the audit report is debarred from reporting the irregularity to the police – It is correct that the FIR adverted to the audit which was conducted in respect of the aff airs of the co-operative society – However, once the criminal law is set into motion, it is the duty of the police to investigate into the alleged off ence – This process cannot be interdicted by relying upon the provisions of sub-section (5B) of s. 81 which cast a duty on the Registrar/auditor to lodge a fi rst information report – Impugned and of the High Court set aside.
