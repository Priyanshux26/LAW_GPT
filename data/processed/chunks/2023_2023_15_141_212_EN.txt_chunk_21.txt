It is well known and well settled that incidental and ancillary powers are exercised in aid of the main Legislation (Reliance is placed on the decision of this court in R. Abdul Quader v. Sales Tax Offi cer26). Therefore, to interpret the word “amend” in Section 19 of the Amendment to mean conferment of a parallel power wider than making curative legislation, which runs contrary to the revised Constitutional architecture of simultaneous levy through the introduction of GST, cannot be said to be in aid of the main subject of Amendment. 43. It is alternatively argued that assuming arguendo, Section 19 has been legislated by the Parliament in exercise of power under Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule (being a residuary entry for matters not enumerated in List II or List III including any tax not mentioned in List II or III), even then in such cases, such power can only be exercised by the Parliament and can in no manner be said to be transferred to the State Legislatures thereby enabling them to amend the plenary legislations. Neither Article 258 nor Article 258A of the Constitution admits of any transfer of legislative power by the Parliament to the State Legislatures. It cannot, therefore, be said that Parliament entrusted the legislative functions to the State Legislature. 44. Counsel argued that the amendment to the VAT legislation cannot also fi nd its source of power in Article 246A. This is for two reasons, fi rstly, under Article 246A, there must be a simultaneous levy by the state as well as by the centre, the scope of which does not arise in the present case. Secondly, Article 246A contemplates, the power to legislate on Goods and Service Tax, which is a defi ned term, entirely diff erent as also wider than a tax on sales. GST cannot be equated with tax on sales by any stretch. 45. It is argued that Section 19 contemplates that ‘any provision of any law relating to tax on goods or services or both in force in any State 26 (1964) 6 SCR 867 THE STATE OF TELANGANA & ORS. v. M/S TIRUMALA 171 CONSTRUCTIONS [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] immediately before the commencement of this Act’ shall continue to be in force until amended or repealed or until the expiration of one year which is earlier. Hence, the edifi ce of Section 19 is based on the law being in force before the Commencement of the Amendment i.e. on 15.09.2016. 46. In one of the cases, pursuant to the dated 31.12.2007 of the AP High Court in Sree Rayalaseema Alkalies and Allied Chemicals Limited v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Ors27., the levy of entry tax under AP Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas Act of 2001, was declared unconstitutional. The said decision of the A.P High Court was set aside by this court on 29.03.2017 by dated 29.03.2017 which is much after the Amendment which came into eff ect on 16.09.2016.
