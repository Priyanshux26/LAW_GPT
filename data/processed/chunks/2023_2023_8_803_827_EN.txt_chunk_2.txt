The Arbitrator further draws inspiration from the fact that the application seeking modification of the dated 12.11.2007 was dismissed on 04.12.2007. The Arbitrator further found that G the agreement entered into between the parties subsequent to the dated 12.11.2007 would indicate that disputes indeed exist. What is, however, conspicuous by its absence is any finding by the Arbitrator, that the final bill dated 13.02.2002 was the result of duress or any other vitiating factors. [Paras 19, 20][823-E-H] H 806 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 1.3 An appeal lies to the Court from an of the Arbitral Tribunal accepting the plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 16. This means that an appeal can be preferred against the of the Arbitral Tribunal allowing the plea that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction. Similar is the case with reference to an which is rendered appealable B under Section 16(3) of the Act. Thereunder also, it is the plea that the Arbitral Tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority which is allowed which is rendered appealable. In this case, by dated 04.03.2009, the Arbitral Tribunal has not allowed the plea be it under section 16(2) or under Section 16(3). On the C other hand, the Tribunal has rejected admittedly the plea of the appellants. Therefore, no appeal could have been filed under Section 37 against the dated 04.03.2009. An passed by the Arbitral Tribunal rejecting the plea under Section 16(2) or 16(3) being part of the Award itself, it is open to the parties to challenge the same when a petition is filed under Section 34 of D the Act challenging the Award. This is the scheme of the Act. This is apparently to confine a right to appeal to those cases where accepting a plea of a party would bring the arbitration to a halt. In fact, the dated 04.03.2009 has been referred to in the Award and it has been treated as part of the Award. It is thereafter that E in a proceeding that the District Court has allowed the petition filed under Section 34 by the appellants. It is no doubt true that the salutary principle which has been enunciated by this Court in Central Inland Water Transport Corporation being in accord with constitutional principles must receive due consideration. However, it cannot be torn out of context. More importantly, as F already noticed when a contractor seeks to wriggle out of a final bill or a ‘no claims due certificate’ which he has submitted, as in a civil Court so before the Arbitrator, he must establish a case that a final bill or a certificate of no further claims was the result of any of the vitiating factors under the law. Sans such finding, the G final bill would stand. If the final bill cannot be overridden by any factors known to law then the clauses relied upon by the appellants in this case would operate. There is no finding by the Arbitrator that the final bill and the no claims certificate were vitiated.
