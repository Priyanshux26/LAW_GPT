While passing the impugned and the High Court has heavily relied upon the earlier decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. Vs. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki and Ors., (2014) 3 SCC 183. H DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. EMINENT 1017 MARKETING PVT. LTD. & ORS. [M. R. SHAH, J.] 3.2 However, it is required to be noted and even as observed and A recorded by the High Court the entire compensation with respect to the land in question was deposited with the Treasury. It is required to be noted that even in the writ petition in paragraph 4 it was stated that in perusal of the award no.09/2008-09, the representatives of the respondents took the possession of the land of the petitioner on 27.09.2012. B Even the possession proceeding was also annexed with the writ petition. In light of the aforesaid facts, the impugned and passed by the High Court declaring the land acquisition proceedings as deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013 is required to be considered. C 3.3 As observed hereinabove and from the impugned and passed by the High Court, the High Court has heavily relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. (supra). The decision of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. (supra) has been subsequently specifically over- ruled by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Indore D Development Authority versus Manoharlal and others, (2020) 8 SCC 129. In paragraphs 365 and 366, the Constitution Bench of this Court has observed and held as under:- “365. Resultantly, the decision rendered in Pune Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, E (2014) 3 SCC 183] is hereby overruled and all other decisions in which Pune Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183] has been followed, are also overruled. The decision in Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. [Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. v. State F of T.N., (2015) 3 SCC 353] cannot be said to be laying down good law, is overruled and other decisions following the same are also overruled. In Indore Development Authority v. Shailendra [(2018) 3 SCC 412], the aspect with respect to the proviso to Section 24(2) and whether “or” has to be read as “nor” or as “and” was not placed for consideration. Therefore, that decision G too cannot prevail, in the light of the discussion in the present . 366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under: H 1018 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 366.1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on 1-1-2014, the date of commencement of the 2013 Act, there is no lapse of proceedings. Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of the 2013 Act. 366.2. In case the award has been passed within the B window period of five years excluding the period covered by an interim of the court, then proceedings shall continue as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the 2013 Act under the 1894 Act as if it has not been repealed.
