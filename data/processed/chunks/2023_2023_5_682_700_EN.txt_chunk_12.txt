What, on the other hand, is contemplated in clause (3) is a notice of three months terminating the contract by either party. H INDIAN OIL CORP. LTD. AND ORS. v. M/S. 699 SATHYANARAYANA SERVICE STATION [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] 25. Shri Shailash Madiyal pointed out that acceptance by the A Management of IOC actually took place on 07.12.2006 and not on 22.11.2006. It is true that in the pleading (before the District Court in proceedings under Section 34), it is inter alia stated as follows:- “4. Subsequent to the submission of the resignation the defendants went ahead with the termination of the dealership on the receipt B of the notorized letter from the claimants, which was approved by the Management of IOC on 07.12.06 and had to take action for making alternative arrangements to operate the retail outlet for protecting the commercial interest of the Corporation and also to keep in mind of the supply of petroleum product to the public at C large.” “5. The dealer have requested for withdrawal of dealership on 25.09.2006. As stated in the earlier para based on the notorized letter reinforcing what is stated in letter dated 25.09.2006. This defendant has obtained management approval for termination of D the dealership on 07.12.2006 and have also replied through the letter dated 21.12.06 mentioning that the dealers request for withdrawal cannot be considered. There is no obligation on the part of Indian Oil corporation as per clause 3 of the dealership agreement to reject the letter of resignation submitted by the plaintiffs.” E However, in the light of communication dated 18.11.2006, essentially recognizing and in substance conveying acceptance or approval; first respondent cannot draw strength from the same. IOC has a case that it was for taking the matter forward in the matter of re- awarding the dealership that the decision dated 07.12.2006 was made. F More importantly, the communication purporting to take back the withdrawal was given by first respondent on 11.12.2006 which is after 07.12.2006. 26. Proceeding on the basis that acceptance is necessary, we are of the view that the High Court in a proceeding under Section 37 of the G Act acted illegally in interfering with the finding of the Arbitrator and what is more, a finding found acceptable to the District Judge under Section 34 of the Act that there was acceptance vide letter dated 18.11.2006. H 700 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 27. The High Court also erred in proceeding to restoration of the dealership to the first respondent after setting aside the award and going further by leaving it open to the first respondent to claim damages. It is beyond the pale of any doubt that the Court cannot, after setting aside the award, proceed to grant further relief by modifying the award. It must leave the parties to work out their remedies in a given B case even where it justifiably interferes with the award [See in this behalf Project Director, National Highways No. 45 E and 220 National Highways Authority of India v. M. Hakeem and another3].
