An omission of a single material fact leading to an incomplete cause of action or omission to contain a concise statement of material facts on which the Election petitioner relies for establishing a cause of action, would entail rejection of Election Petition under VII Rule 11 read with Section 83 and 87 of the RP Act. 25. In that view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the Election Petition being No. 1 of 2021 filed by the Respondent No. 1 (Election Petitioner) before the High Court deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed. 26. The Appeal stands allowed accordingly. Headnotes prepared by: Result of the case: Aandrita Deb, Hony. Associate Editor Appeal allowed. (Verified by: Liz Mathew, Sr. Adv.)
