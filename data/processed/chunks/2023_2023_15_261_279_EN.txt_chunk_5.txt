It is correct that in the grounds of appeal before the High Court no plea of juvenility was raised. The plea of the petitioner is predicated 268 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. only on CM No.96164/2012 fi led seeking to raise the plea of juvenility based on the additional grounds. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we are of the view that the additional documents brought on record ought to have been examined and they require examination as to whether the petitioner can raise the plea of juvenility. We thus, refer the matter to the trial Court for recording evidence on the basis of the certifi cates sought to be produced by the petitioner as a transfer certifi cate and submit a report to this Court….” 15. Accordingly, the First Additional Sessions Judge, Barabanki in compliance of the of this Court had submitted a Report dated 28.02.2022. According to this report, the D.O.B of the appellant should be taken as recorded in the Family Register, which is 1975 and therefore at the time of the commission of the off ence he was not a juvenile. The Trial Court had examined the entry of the Scholar Register of the National Inter College, Barabanki where the D.O.B of the appellant was 05.07.1980. The D.O.B entered in the Scholar Register was based on a Transfer Certifi cate dated 05.07.1995 issued by High School, Kamela which had also been placed on record by the appellant, however, the original records of High School, Kamela were not produced and the evidence of the Family Register and bone ossifi cation test was also against the appellant. By comparing these evidences, the Trial Court declared the D.O.B of the appellant to be 1975 and consequently, the report of the Additional Sessions Judge dated 28.02.2022 declared that the appellant was not a juvenile on the date of the commission of the alleged off ence. 16. The report dated 28.02.2022 was examined by this Court and it was felt that the Trial Court did not examine the Transfer Certifi cate of the appellant, which was placed before it. Hence, the issue was again remitted back to the Additional Sessions Judge, Barabanki on 15.07.2022 by this Court for fresh consideration on the aspect of juvenility and another report was directed to be fi led. The of this Court dated 15.07.2022 is as follows: “We have perused the report of the First Additional Sessions Judge, Barabanki dated 28.02.2022 but that report does not analyze the PAWAN KUMAR v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS. 269 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] transfer certifi cate which is the document sought to be relied upon by the petitioner as an additional document before the High Court for which an application had been fi led before it. That is what is required to be considered. Undisputedly, the other documents do not go in favour of the petitioner and show the age as more than 16 years. It appears that the District Judge has not analysed the document or its veracity which is what is required to be considered.
