Shri Vinod Prasad, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that the CJM as also the High Court fell in error in taking cognizance under Section 190(1)(b) Cr.P.C. inasmuch as the CJM had relied upon not only the Protest Petition which was supported 1 Cr.P.C. 2 CJM 3 IPC 4 FIR 658 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports by affidavit of the complainant but also on the affidavits of witnesses which were filed along with the Protest Petition to support the contents of the complaint. The submission was that once the CJM was relying upon additional material in the form of evidence produced by the complainant along with the Protest Petition then the only option for the CJM was to treat it as a complaint under Section 200 Cr.P.C. and proceed accordingly. The said case could not have been continued as a State case and should have been treated as a private complaint.
