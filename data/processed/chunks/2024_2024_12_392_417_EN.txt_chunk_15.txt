The appellant’s actions cannot be justified as a defensive response to the minor injuries he sustained. 26.7 In light of the above findings, the plea of exceeding the right of private defense under Exception 2 to Section 300, IPC, is not applicable to the appellant’s case. The courts below have rightly rejected this argument, holding that the appellant was not under any imminent peril and that his actions were deliberate and excessive. 10 [2005] 2 SCR 536 : (2005) 10 SCC 358 11 [1981] 3 SCR 352 : (1981) 2 SCC 531 414 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 27. Parity with Other Accused Persons: 27.1 The appellant has further contended that his sentence should be reduced on the grounds of parity with his co-accused. It is argued that since one co-accused had his sentence reduced, and another was acquitted by this Court, the appellant should be afforded similar leniency. The appellant is seeking similar leniency on the ground that the circumstances and involvement of all accused were substantially similar. 27.2 The doctrine of parity ensures fairness in sentencing when co-accused persons are similarly situated and share the same level of culpability. However, parity is not an automatic entitlement; the role, intent, and actions of each accused must be individually assessed to determine their degree of involvement in the crime. 27.3 The evidence presented during the trial clearly establishes that the appellant played a distinct and more culpable role in the incident. While the co-accused were armed with sticks and caused non-fatal injuries to the victims, the appellant alone was armed with a knife and used it to inflict fatal injuries on the deceased. The testimony of PW-1 reveals that the appellant stabbed the deceased after his stick was snatched during the altercation. This sequence of events demonstrates a deliberate escalation by the appellant, who resorted to using a deadly weapon with the intent to cause grievous harm. 27.4 Nothing has been brought on record to show that the other accused persons had knowledge of appellant being in possession of the knife. Thus, there is no evidence to show that the other accused persons shared a common intention with the appellant to commit murder. The courts below have meticulously analyzed the evidence and concluded that the co-accused did not share a common intention to commit murder. While the group acted in concert to assault the victims, the fatal stabbing by the appellant was an independent and unilateral act. This finding is crucial in distinguishing the appellant’s culpability from that of his co-accused. The absence of common intention among the co-accused precludes the application of vicarious liability under Section 34, IPC, for the act of murder. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 415 Kunhimuhammed@Kunheethu v. The State of Kerala 27.5 The sentence of Accused No. 2 was reduced from six years to three years on the grounds that he caused only grievous hurt with a stick and did not participate in the stabbing and was also unaware of the knife in possession of appellant.
