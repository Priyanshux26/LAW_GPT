However, on the issuance of Notifi cation No.2 of 2006 dated 01.03.2006 under which ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was excluded or in other words not included in the said notifi cation, the assessee changed the description of its product from ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ to ‘chewing tobacco’. The date of communication of the letter dated 30.03.2006 by the assessee also acquires signifi cance in as much as the Notifi cation No.2 of 2006 dated 01.03.2006 were to take eff ect from 01.04.2006 and just two days before the date of the said Notifi cation No.2 of 2006 coming into eff ect, this COMMR.

The intention of springing up such a letter is evident from the fact that intention was to evade payment of duty payable under Section 4 of CE Act; despite knowing the fact that its product was not covered under relevant notifi cation which provides for valuation under Section 4A, yet the assessee did so, only to pay duty on lower value as per Section 4A of CE Act, by claiming the product manufactured by it as ‘chewing tobacco’ rather than ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ to avail benefi t of MRP-based assessment which was lower than the value as prescribed under Section 4 of the CE Act. 43.

It is for this precise reason that the act of the assessee was held to be a deliberate and accordingly wilful misstatement was alleged on part of the assessee, with an intention to evade duty payable under Section 4 of the CE Act, which would attract the extended period of limitation, namely proviso to Section 11A (1) being invoked.
