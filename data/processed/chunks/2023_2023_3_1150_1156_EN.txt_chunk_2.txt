H ANIL MINDA AND OTHERS v. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME 1153 TAX [M. R. SHAH, J.] 3.1 Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective A assessees has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court has erred in holding that the respective assessment s were within the period of two years and therefore not barred by limitation. 3.2 It is submitted that in the present case the last authorization B was on 26.03.2001 and therefore as per Explanation 2 to Section 158BE of the Act the last authorization would be the starting point of limitation. It is submitted that therefore even if the first authorization dated 13.03.2001 was executed on a later date i.e., on 11.04.2001, that would be of no consequence and for the purpose of reckoning the limitation period, the first authorization is irrelevant and it is the “last of the C authorization” which has to be kept in mind. It is submitted that in the present case, the last authorization is dated 26.03.2001 which was executed on the same date and therefore the period of two years is to be counted from that date. 3.3 Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective D assessees has relied upon the decision of the Karnataka High Court in the case of C.Ramaiah Reddy v. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, (2011) 244 CTR 126 (Karn.) (para 47) in support of his submission. 4. Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the E Revenue has vehemently submitted that as per Explanation 2 of Section 158BE of the Act, when it is a case of search, period of limitation is to be counted from the date on which the last Panchnama was drawn. It is submitted that in the present case, the last Panchnama on conclusion of the search was drawn on 11.04.2001 and therefore the limitation period of two years would start from 11.04.2001. It is submitted that if the F submission on behalf of the assessees is accepted, in that case, the Explanation 2 to Section 158BE would become nugatory and redundant. 4.1 It is further submitted by the learned ASG appearing on behalf of the Revenue that Explanation 2 to Section 158BE has been specifically inserted with a view to give last of the Panchnama as the starting point G of limitation. It is submitted that the time for completion of the block assessment under Section 158BC/158BE is the conclusion of search/ drawing of last Panchnama which will be relevant and not the dates of issuance of various authorizations. It is submitted that in a given case where number of authorizations are issued and relevant material/s is/are collected during the search on different dates on the basis of the different H 1154 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A authorizations, ultimately the assessment proceedings would be on the basis of the entire material collected during the search and on the basis of the Panchnama drawn. It is submitted that therefore the date on which the last Panchnama was drawn is the relevant date for the purpose of block assessment.
