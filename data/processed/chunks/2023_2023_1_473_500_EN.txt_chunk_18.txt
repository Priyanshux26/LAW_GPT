32. For the reasons indicated above, the appeals against the C of the Lucknow Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 18 October 2019 are dismissed. 33. Applications for intervention16 were filed by the Federation of AYUSH drugs Manufacturers17, the President and Secretary of the Federation, the investor of “S-compound”18, and a small-scale D manufacturing unit engaged in the production of Ayurvedic Medicines. The Federation consists of nine members who are registered under the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act 2006 and are engaged in the manufacture and sale of Ayurvedic drugs. The following arguments were made in the application: E (i) This Court in Caterpillar India Pvt. Ltd. v. Western Coal Fields19 observed that purchase preference creates a monopoly. In view of the in Caterpillar India (supra), the Union Cabinet by an dated 21 November 2007 adopted a policy whereby purchase preference to Central Public Sector Enterprises was terminated from 31 F March 2008; and (ii) The Director, Central Vigilance Commission issued a circular on 9 November 200920 to review the Purchase Preference Policy for the products and services of Central Public Sector Enterprises in view of the in Caterpillar India G 16 IA 9631 of 2020; IA No. 46786 of 2022 17"Federation” 18 S-Compound is a recognised herbal ayurvedic drug used in the treatment of ‘rheumatoid arthritis’ and ‘osteo arthritis’. 19(2007) 11 SCC 32 20 Circular No. 31/10/09 H 500 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A Pvt. Ltd. (supra). On 23 March 2012, the Ministry of MSME framed a policy titled “Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) 2012” which stipulates that every Central Ministry or Department of PSU shall procure a minimum of 20 percent of the total annual purchases from micro and small enterprises. B 34. The intervention applicant submitted as follows: (i) Policies of the Central and State government stipulate that 25 percent of the medicines shall be procured from MSMEs. Thus, the term ‘atleast 50%’ in paragraph 4(vi)(b) of the Operational Guidelines must be read as limiting the C procurement from establishments in paragraph 4(vi)(b) to 50 percent and giving other manufacturers a level playing field under paragraph 4(vi)(c); (ii) The Central and the State Governments have notified procurement policies directing that a certain percent of the D procurement must be from the MSMEs’. The procurement of medicines from IMPCL on nomination is contrary to the procurement policies notified by the Government; (iii) IMPCL also sells products in the open market. Thus, the argument that IMPCL is established solely to supply medicines to the Government is misleading; and E (iv) IMPCL has not submitted records to show that the other manufacturers cannot supply equivalent or better-quality drugs. 35. The intervention applications seek to enlarge the scope of the Special Leave Petition. The issue before this Court falls squarely on the F interpretation of paragraph 4(vi)(b). However, the intervention applicant has prayed that in accordance with the policies of the State and the Central Government, a minimum percent of Ayurvedic drugs must be procured from MSMEs under paragraph 4(vi)(c).
