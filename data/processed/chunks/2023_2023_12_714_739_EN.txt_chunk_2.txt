45 to seek release on bail, if he/she so chooses. [Paras 32, 33] Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Non-compliance of mandate under Art.22 of Constitution and s.19 of the 2002 Act – Arbitrary exercise of power by ED: Held: In the case on hand, the admitted position is that the ED’s Investigating Offi cer merely read out or permitted reading of the grounds of arrest of the appellants and left it at that, which is also disputed by the appellants – As this form of communication is not found to be adequate to fulfi l compliance with the mandate of Art. 22(1) of the Constitution and s.19(1) of the Act of 2002, there is no hesitation in holding that their arrest PANKAJ BANSAL v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 717 was not in keeping with the provisions of s.19(1) of the Act of 2002 – Further, the clandestine conduct of the ED in proceeding against the appellants, by recording the second ECIR immediately after they secured interim protection in relation to the fi rst ECIR, does not commend acceptance as it reeks of arbitrary exercise of power – In eff ect, the arrest of the appellants and, in consequence, their remand to the custody of the ED and, thereafter, to judicial custody, cannot be sustained.
