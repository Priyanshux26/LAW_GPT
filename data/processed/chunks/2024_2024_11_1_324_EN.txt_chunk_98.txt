Ltd. v. Inspector, Kerala Govt (1998) 8 SCC 227 [13] : 1998 INSC 423; Workmen v. Meenakshi Mills Ltd. (1992) 3 SCC 336 [27] : 1992 INSC 164; Pathumma v. State of Kerala (1978) 2 SCC 1 : 1978 INSC 7 134 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports We may reiterate the observations in one such case to understand this position of law. 145. In State of Gujarat v. Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat,124 a bench of seven judges reconsidered several questions which were decided in Mohd Hanif Qureshi. Significantly, this Court had occasion to lay down the correct position on the role played by Directive Principles in our constitutional scheme, particularly, with regard to their role vis-à-vis fundamental rights. The Court moved away from the view in Mohd Hanif Qureshi that the implementation of a Directive Principle cannot be considered a valid ground for establishing the reasonability of the restriction imposed on the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g). After reviewing several cases on this point, this Court (speaking through Chief Justice Lahoti) laid down the law in the following terms: “41. [….] For judging the reasonability of restrictions imposed on fundamental rights the relevant considerations are not only those as stated in Article 19 itself or in Part III of the Constitution: the directive principles stated in Part IV are also relevant. Changing factual conditions and State policy, including the one reflected in the impugned enactment, have to be considered and given weightage to by the courts while deciding the constitutional validity of legislative enactments. A restriction placed on any fundamental right, aimed at securing directive principles will be held as reasonable and hence intra vires subject to two limitations: first, that it does not run in clear conflict with the fundamental right, and secondly, that it has been enacted within the legislative competence of the enacting legislature under Part XI Chapter I of the Constitution. … 47 […] The series of decisions which we have referred to hereinabove and the series of decisions which formulate the three stages of development of the relationship between directive principles and fundamental rights undoubtedly 124 [2005] Supp. 4 SCR 582 : (2005) 8 SCC 534 : 2005 INSC 525 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 135 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. hold that, while interpreting the interplay of rights and restrictions, Part III (Fundamental rights) and Part IV (Directive principles) have to be read together. The restriction which can be placed on the rights listed in Article 19(1) are not subject only to Articles 19(2) to 19(6); the provisions contained in the chapter on directive principles of State policy can also be pressed into service and relied on for the purpose of adjudging the reasonability of restrictions placed on the fundamental rights.” 146. Similarly, in view of the above jurisprudence which mandates that Directive Principles and fundamental rights be viewed as ‘complementary and supplementary’, Directive Principles have also acquired a role in interpreting fundamental Rights. Reference may be made to the decision in State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas125 and Ashok Kumar Thakur v Union of India,126 where this Court interpreted the right to equality under Article 14 in light of the Directive Principles.
