Merely because the deceased was depressed about her situation, it would not be enough to convict the appellants, particularly since, prima facie, the ingredients of Section 306 IPC are not fulfilled. 8. Mr. Gaware submitted that the deceased had been residing separately from the appellants since 8th August 2013. In the intervening period between the date of separation and the date of the incident, the appellants had interacted with the deceased only on one occasion that is on the date of the Mahalokadalat which was held on 17th February 2014. He submitted that the FIR wrongly mentions the date of the mahalokadalat to be 17th February 2015. It is submitted that the deceased committed suicide after over a year had passed. However, the courts below did not consider this aspect or look into the roznama of court proceedings which clearly showed the date on which the mahalokadalat had been held. Therefore, he submitted that in view of the time gap between the alleged meeting and the date of suicide, there is no immediate instigation or abetment to commit suicide which can be attributed to the appellants. 9. Mr. Gaware placed reliance on the s of this Court in the cases of Mohit Singhal and Another v. State of Uttarakhand and Others,6 Gurjit Singh v. State of Punjab,7 State of West Bengal v. Indrajit Kundu and Others,8 Madan Mohan Singh v. State of Gujarat and Another,9 Yogesh alias Sachin Jagdish Joshi v. State of Maharashtra10 and Sanju @ Sanjay Singh Sengar v. State of M.P.11. He submitted in view of the material placed on record and 6 2023 INSC 1035 : (2024) 1 SCC 417 7 2019 INSC 1281 : [2019] 14 SCR 232 : (2020) 14 SCC 264 8 2019 INSC 1164 : [2019] 13 SCR 489 : (2019) 10 SCC 188 9 2010 INSC 521 : [2010] 10 SCR 351 : (2010) 8 SCC 628 10 2008 INSC 534 : [2008] 6 SCR 1116 : (2008) 10 SCC 394 11 2002 INSC 250 : [2002] 3 SCR 668 : (2002) 5 SCC 371 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1167 Prakash and Others v. The State of Maharashtra and Another the authorities cited, the appeal deserves to be allowed and the appellants deserve to be discharged of all charges. 10. Per contra, Mr. Siddharth Dharmadhikari, learned counsel, submitted that no interference is warranted in the concurrent findings of the trial court and the High Court. He submitted that there is sufficient material against the appellants to proceed against them. He further submitted that in view of the allegations levelled against the appellants and the evidence collected by the investigating agency, it is not a fit case to allow this appeal. Mr. Dharmadhikari, therefore, prayed for the dismissal of this appeal. 11. We have carefully considered the rival submissions and perused the material placed on record. 12. The relevant provisions of the IPC that fall for consideration are as under: “306. Abetment of suicide.- If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
