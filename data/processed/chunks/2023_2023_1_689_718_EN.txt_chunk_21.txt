In the impugned and , the High Court has elaborately and comprehensively explained the rationale behind introduction of Section 158BC in Section 140A and has specifically observed and held that the liability of payment of interest does not stop G merely on filing of the return but is attracted in terms of Section 140A till payment of tax in terms of the section and even now the provisions of Section 158BFA(1) and Section 140A operate independently. We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court. H 716 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 10.4 Now so far as the main submission on behalf of the assessee that in absence of any notice under Section 158BC served upon the concerned assessee and in view of insertion of the words “Section 158BC” in Section 158BD inserted vide Finance Act, 2002, there shall not be any liability to pay interest under Section 158BFA is concerned, the aforesaid submission is absolutely erroneous and has no substance. B It is required to be noted that prior to amendment in Section 158BD vide Finance Act, 2002 and even thereafter, the provisions of Section 158BC would be applicable in case of “searched persons”. Section 158BD would be applicable in case of persons “other than searched persons”. Therefore, in case of a person “other than searched person”, no notice C under Section 158BC which is required to be issued in case of “searched persons” was required to be issued. For a person “other than searched person”, notice under Section 158BD is sufficient. 10.5 Now so far as the submission on behalf of the assessee that D the words “under Section 158BC” has been inserted in Section 158BD vide Finance Act, 2002 and therefore, in absence of any notice under Section 158BC prior to the amendment, there shall not be any liability to pay interest under Section 158BFA is concerned, a perusal of the Notes on Clauses appended to Clause 64 of the Finance Bill, 2002, it appears that the same is clarificatory in nature. E Clause 64 of the Finance Bill 2002, provides that:- “In section 158BD of the Income-tax Act, after the words “that Assessing Officer shall proceed”, the words, figures and letters “under Section 158BC” shall be inserted with effect from the F 1st day of June, 2002.” The Notes on Clauses appended to Clause 64 of the Finance Bill 2002 states the following:- “It is proposed to insert the words “under section 158BC” after the words “that Assessing Officer shall proceed” so as G to clarify that the Assessing Officer shall proceed against such other person under section 158BC”. 10.6 At this stage, it is required to be noted that as observed by this Court in the case of Vatika Township Private Limited (supra), Chapter XIV-B prescribes a special procedure for computation of income H K.L. SWAMY v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX & 717 ANR. [M. R. SHAH, J.] for the block period in search and seizure cases. Section 158BD shall be A applicable in case of any person other than a person with respect to whom search was made.
