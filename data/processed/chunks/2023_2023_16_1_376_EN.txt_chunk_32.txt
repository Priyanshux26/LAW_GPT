If the people do not feel the need to abrogate or modify Article 370, they would have done so through their representatives. Just as Parliament cannot decide the members of the Rajya Sabha on behalf of the states, it cannot decide on behalf of the people of the state. Bicameralism and shared sovereignty would prohibit this unilateral non-democratic process wherein the people of the State are excluded.101 ii. Submissions of the Union of India102 35. The process of constitutional integration of Jammu and Kashmir bears all the resemblance with the process of constitutional integration of 99 (Constituent Assembly Debates on November 17, 1948, Speech by Mr. KT Shah, Book 2, Pgs. 437-438); Submissions On Behalf Of The Petitioners, Mr Shekhar Naphade, Senior Advocate. 100 Submissions On Behalf of The Petitioners, Mr Shekhar Naphade, Senior Advocate. 101 Written Submissions of Ms. Nitya Ramakrishnan, Senior Advocate, Rejoinder. 102 Mr R Venkataramani, the Attorney General for India made prefatory submissions which are recorded in the initial six paragraphs below. Thereafter the substantive submissions were made by Mr Tushar Mehta which are encapsulated after the submissions of the Attorney General. IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 51 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] various territories of India, namely democratization combined with merger of small states, formation of union of states, the idea of having constituent assemblies for framing constitutions, etc. There was no distinct or special compact between Union of India and Jammu and Kashmir as far as the constitutional integration process was concerned.103 36. It was open to the President to take a fi nal stock of the exercise of the authority under Article 370(1)(d), and to decide as to whether there is a need of updating exercise at all, or there is a need for any other invocation of Article 370(1)(d). This power of the President is not limited or conditioned by any practice in relation to Article 370 in the past.104 37. Article 370 was conceived and designed to aid the constitutional integration process on the same lines as it happened with other states. Its continued exercise over a period cannot be seen as a cloud over or distortion of its original purpose.105 38. B states are a distinct class of territories and their reorganisation under Article 3 ought to receive distinct consideration.106 39. Neither asymmetrical federalism nor any other federal features have been infringed.107 40. No rights in relation to representative democracy have been taken away.108 41. Article 370 is the only provision in the Constitution which the Constitution itself declares to be “temporary”. This understanding that it is temporary is furthered from the drafting history of the article, debates in the Constituent Assembly, Parliamentary debates, the gradual issuance of constitution s. The other provisions of the Part XXI are named either “special provisions” or “transitory provisions”.109 103 Written Submissions of Mr. R.
