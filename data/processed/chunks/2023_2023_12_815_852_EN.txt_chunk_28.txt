of legitimate inferences fl owing from evidence, circumstantial or direct.” The role of courts in such circumstances assumes greater importance and it is expected that the courts would deal with such cases in a more realistic manner and not allow the criminals to escape on account of procedural technicalities, perfunctory investigation or insignifi cant lacunas in the evidence as otherwise the criminals would receive encouragement and the victims of crime would be totally discouraged by the crime going unpunished. The courts are expected to be sensitive in cases involving crime against women. 63. In the result, both the appeals fail and are hereby dismissed. 64. However, as Maheshwari Devi (mother-in-law) appellant of Criminal Appeal No. 2430 of 2014 has been convicted only for the off ence punishable under Section 498A of the IPC, we reduce her sentence to the period already undergone. Even otherwise, she is on bail. Maheshwari Devi need not now surrender. Her bail bonds stand discharged. 65. Pending applications if any shall stand disposed of.
