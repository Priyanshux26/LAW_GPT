The CAT, after hearing parties and considering the material on record, vide dated 30.12.2020 allowed the Original Application filed by the respondent no.1. It directed the appellant to count the respondent no.1’s deputation service period from 21.05.2008 to 13.06.2014 for promotion to the post of Deputy General Manager (Technical) and to promote him as Deputy General Manager (Technical) with effect from 27.10.2017 with all consequential benefits. The appellant was further directed to consider his case for promotion to the post of General Manager (Technical) as per rules. In compliance of the CAT’s , respondent no.1 was promoted to the post of Deputy General Manager (Technical) on 07.06.2021. The appellant challenged the CAT dated 30.12.2020 in the High Court through W.P. No. 11060 of 2021, which has been dismissed by the High Court vide the Impugned dated 01.03.2023. SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANT: 10. It was submitted by the learned counsel that the High Court failed to consider that as per the Schedule to the Recruitment Regulations, promotion to the post of Deputy General Manager (Technical) inter alia, could be made by promoting candidates continuously holding the post of Manager (Technical) for a period of at least 526 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports four years. It was pointed out that the respondent no.1 joined the appellant on deputation basis and worked till 13.06.2014, when he was repatriated to his parent department. Thereafter, the respondent no.1 re-joined the appellant on direct recruitment basis to the post of Manager (Technical) on 26.08.2015 i.e., after a gap of 1 year and 2 months. It was argued that the service rendered by the respondent no.1 on deputation basis could not be considered due to this gap and in view of the same, he could be eligible for promotion to the post of Deputy General Manager (Technical) only after four years of service from the date of appointment on direct recruitment basis i.e., 26.08.2015. Thus, the respondent no.1 was ineligible for promotion as on 27.07.2017 i.e., the date from which the CAT has directed the appellant to promote the respondent no.1 to the post of Deputy General Manager (Technical). 11. Learned counsel contended that the respondent no.1 and other candidates on deputation service on the post of Manager (Technical) cannot be considered equally for promotion to the post of Deputy General Manager (Technical) as, on the date of direct recruitment examination, i.e., 23.08.2014, the respondent no.1 was not incumbent as a Manager (Technical) as he was already repatriated to his parent department.
