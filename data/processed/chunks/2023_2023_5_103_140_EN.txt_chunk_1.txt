The present one cannot be said to be a case involving any “doubt” about non-existence of arbitration agreement in relation to the dispute in question. [Paras 17, 17.1][137-F-G; 138-A-C] E 1.2 There being no doubt about non-existence of arbitration agreement in relation to the entire subject-matter of the suit, and when the substantive reliefs claimed in the suits fall outside the arbitration clause in the original licence agreement, the view taken by the High Court does not appear to be suffering from F any infirmity or against any principle laid down by this Court. Even if by reference to remote pedigree, the original licence agreement is said to be the genesis of the contractual relations of the appellant and the respondent No. 1, that does not ipso facto lead to the availability of the arbitration agreement in relation to the dispute in question, which emanates from the tripartite G agreement and which cannot be determined without reference to the said tripartite agreement and without involving all the parties thereto. In other words, no dispute resolution process, including arbitration, could be undertaken in relation to the subject-matter of the suit without reference to the terms of tripartite agreement H and without involving the bank- respondent No.2. This is apart GUJARAT COMPOSITE LIMITED v. A INFRASTRUCTURE 105 LIMITED & ORS. from the fact that the other elements of dispute pertaining to the A subsequent purchasers too cannot be resolved in any forum without reference to the tripartite agreement and its amended clause, which did not provide for arbitration. Thus, the ancestry of the tripartite agreement, in the facts of the present case, does not lead to the result desired by the appellant. Therefore, even B on the principles enunciated in Vidya Drolia, the prayer of the present appellant for reference to arbitration under Section 8 cannot be granted. On the facts and in the circumstances of the present case and in the nature of transactions as also the nature of reliefs claimed in the suit, the view taken by the Commercial Court and the High Court in declining the prayer of the appellant C for reference to arbitration cannot be faulted.
