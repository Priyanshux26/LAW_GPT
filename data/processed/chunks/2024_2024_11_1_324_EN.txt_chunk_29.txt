Digital Supreme Court Reports not arise for consideration in any of those decisions which were rendered on a certain premise as indicated therein, which assumption is now seriously challenged by Shri F.S. Nariman. Even if it is assumed that Article 145(3) of the Constitution is not attracted, it does appear to us that in to settle the controversy on this point which is of some significance and to avoid the question being reagitated before another Bench of less than five Judges, the more appropriate course is to refer these matters for being heard and decided by a Bench of not less than five Judges.” (emphasis supplied) 21. The underlying appeals were then placed before a bench of five judges of this Court. By an dated 21 March 2001,23 the five- judge bench noted the contentions which had been raised before the three-judge bench about the revival of Article 31-C. Further, it was observed that the counsel were heard by the Bench at length on the “various issues” that arose in the case, including the interpretation of Article 39(b). The bench went on to express the need to reconsider the view taken by this Court in Sanjeev Coke on the interpretation of Article 39(b), where this Court relied on a concurring opinion authored by Justice Krishna Iyer in State of Karnataka v. Ranganatha Reddy,24 on behalf of a minority of judges. 22. Part D of this judgement will explore these decisions and their interpretation of Article 39(b) in further detail. At this stage, to understand the scope of the reference, it is sufficient to note that in Ranganatha Reddy, the validity of the Karnataka Contract Carriages (Acquisition) Act 1976 was under challenge. The majority opinion authored by Justice Untwalia (for himself and three other judges) upheld the constitutionality of the legislation on its merits. However, Justice Krishna Iyer (for himself and two other judges) authored a concurring opinion, where the enactment was upheld on the ground that it had a nexus with Article 39(b), which protected the legislation under Article 31C. The majority opinion expressly noted that it did not consider it necessary to deal with Article 31C or Article 39(b) and must 23 (2001) 4 SCC 455 (“five-judge bench ”) 24 [1978] 1 SCR 641 : (1977) 4 SCC 471 : 1977 INSC 196 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 41 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. not be construed to agree with the observations of Justice Krishna Iyer. Subsequently, in Sanjeev Coke, while upholding the validity of the Coking Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act 1972, a five-judge Bench of this Court adopted the view taken in the judgement authored by Justice Krishna Iyer, on behalf of the minority in Ranganatha Reddy. 23. In this backdrop, the Bench of five judges expressed the view that the interpretation of Article 39(b) in Sanjeev Coke, requires reconsideration and referred the cases to a larger bench, in the following terms: “6. The interpretation put on Article 39(b) by Krishna Iyer, J.in Ranganatha Reddy case [(1977) 4 SCC 471 : (1978) 1 SCR 641] was not specifically assented to in the majority decision but in Sanjeev Coke case[(1983) 1 SCC 147 : (1983) 1 SCR 1000] it is the observations in the of Krishna Iyer, J. which have been followed.
