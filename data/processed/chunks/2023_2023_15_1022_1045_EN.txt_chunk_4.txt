As the proceedings for the post-lunch session commenced, and the “For ” case CA(AT) No.64 of 2020 was called out (as is the practice to take up “For ” cases in the beginning), some lawyers started to intervene on which the ORBIT ELECTRICALS PRIVATE LIMITED v. 1029 DEEPAK KISHAN CHHABRIA & ORS. Presiding Judge commented that whatever you want to fi le, please bring it on record. Thereafter, the pronouncement of the said was completed. It may be pointed out that no lawyer conveyed the orally to me during the lunch hour when I was available in my offi ce chamber, nor copy of the said was provided to the Court Master. If this would have been done, the unfortunate situation may not have arisen. I respectfully submit that I hold the Hon’ble Supreme Court in highest regard and esteem and there has been no intention to disobey the of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. I deeply regret that such a situation arose in the matter and off er sincere apology for the same.” 9 The Member (Technical) has adverted to the events which transpired before the NCLAT in the appeal on 13 October 2023.
