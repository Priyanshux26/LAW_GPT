The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 and the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 also do not define these two expressions. Even G the Companies Act, 2013 does not define these two expressions. Therefore, for finding an answer to the meaning of the word “asset” used in Sections 18 and 25, one has to necessarily undertake a journey from the known to the unknown. 25. Before we proceed further, we may have to take note of the manner in which the word “property” is defined in The Recovery of H 1038 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A Debts and Bankruptcy Act,1993 and the manner in which it is defined in IBC. While the definition of the word in the 1993 Act appears to be exhaustive, the definition in IBC is only inclusive (we have extracted both definitions elsewhere). 26. As we have pointed out earlier, the word “asset” is not defined, B either in IBC or in any of the seven enactments referred to in Section 3(37) of the Code. But the word “asset” is defined in Section 102(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to include “property or right of any kind”. Though Section 102 applies as such to Chapter X-A of the Income Tax Act, the definition throws light on the fact that property or right of any kind is considered to be an asset. C 27. Having taken note of the definition of the expression “property” and the absence of the definition of the word “asset” in IBC, it is now appropriate for us to return to the facts of this case and to find out the nature of the rights that the Corporate Debtor admittedly has in the immovable property namely land of the extent of acres 10.19. This can D be done by making a reference to certain documents and the chain of events borne out by these documents. 28. The documents to which useful reference can be made are: (i) MoU dated 24.01.2008; (ii) Shareholders Agreement dated 24.01.2008; (iii) Sale Certificate dated 29.01.2008; (iv) Development E Agreement dated 16.06.2008; (v)Memorandum Recording Possession dated 02.03.2010 executed by the shareholders of Energy Properties; (vi)Memorandum Recording Possession dated 24.06.2010 executed by Energy Properties; and (vii) Leave and License Agreement dated 19.08.2011. Let us now see the story as revealed by each of these documents. F 29. The first of these documents is the Memorandum of Understanding dated 24.01.2008, entered into between three parties namely, (i) Energy Properties; (ii) the Corporate Debtor; and (iii) the shareholders of Energy Properties. By this MoU, the Corporate Debtor agreed to provide financial accommodation to the total extent of Rs.12 G crores to Energy Properties, for the purpose of enabling them to purchase the land in question (by utilizing a sum of Rs. 2.70 crores) and for the purpose of tiding over a crisis (by utilizing the balance of Rs.9.30 crores).
