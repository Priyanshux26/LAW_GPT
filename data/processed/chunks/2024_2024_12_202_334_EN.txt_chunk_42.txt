As we have observed in the foregoing parts of this , assignment of functions is a mandatory requirement for the exercise of jurisdiction by the “proper officer”. The observations made in Sayed Ali (supra) on the connection between Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 are obiter dicta at best and do not constitute the binding ratio decidendi of that . 83. Further, Sayed Ali (supra) could not have been relied upon by this Court in Canon India (supra) as it could not have been applied for the period subsequent to 08.04.2011 in view of the fact that Section 17 of the Act, 1962 has undergone a radical change by virtue of the amendments made by the Finance Act, 2011. iii. Changes to Section 17 w.e.f. 11.04.2011 – the assessment of bill(s) of entry and shipping bill(s) 84. Section 17 of the Act, 1962 was amended by Section 38 of the Finance Act, 2011 with effect from 08.04.2011. The amendment altered the method of assessment of bill(s) of entry and shipping bill(s). This change appears not to have been brought to the notice of this Court while Canon India (supra) was heard. 85. We note that with effect from 08.04.2011, the functions of the proper officer under Section 17 also underwent certain changes. One such 268 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports change is that the assessment of bill(s) of entry and shipping bill(s) was no longer the task of the “proper officer”. With effect from 08.04.2011, Bill(s) of Entry and/or Shipping Bill(s) are self- assessed. This self-assessment is to be accepted or rejected by the proper officer subject to verification in certain cases. 86. The “proper officer” appointed for the purpose of Section 17 of the Act, 1962 under a notification issued under Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962 could only make a re-assessment of the bill(s) of entry and shipping bill(s) in case they did not agree with the self- assessment of the importer or the exporter as the case may be. 87. The purport of Section 17 as it stood before 08.04.2011 and after 08.04.2011 was analysed by a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court in the case of M/s. N.C. Alexander v. The Commissioner of Customs, Chennai in W.P. Nos. 33099 of 2015. The relevant paragraphs of the are reproduced below: “207. Thus, there was a paradigm shift in the method of assessment with effect from 08.04.2011. Till 07.4.2011, the assessment of Bill of Entry(s) or the Shipping Bill(s) was by a “proper officer” appointed for that purpose under Section 2(34) of the Custom Act, 1962. The assessment was left to the Group ‘B’ Gazetted Officers and it is only such officers were appointed as “proper officers” for assessment under Section 17. 208. However, after 08.04.2011, Bill(s) of Entry (in the case of import) or Shipping Bill(s) (in the case of export) are to be self assessed by an importer or an exporter under Sections 46 and 50 of the Customs Act, 1962 respectively.
