However, it would not be permissible to prescribe lower G qualifying marks or a lesser level of evaluation for the members of reserved categories since that would compromise the efficiency of administration. We reiterate that while it may be permissible to prescribe a reasonably lesser qualifying marks or evaluation for the OBCs, SCs H 808 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A and STs — consistent with the efficiency of administration and the nature of duties attaching to the office concerned — in the matter of direct recruitment, such a course would not be permissible in the matter of promotions for the reasons recorded hereinabove.” B b. Pandian, J: “240. In Mohan Kumar Singhania v. Union of India [1992 Supp (1) SCC 594 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 455 : (1992) 19 ATC 881] a three-Judge Bench of this Court to which I was a party has taken a view that once candidates even from C reserved communities are allocated and appointed to a Service based on their ranks and performance and brought under the one and same stream of category, then they too have to be treated on par with all other selected candidates and there cannot be any question of preferential treatment at that stage on the ground that they belong to reserved D community though they may be entitled for all other statutory benefits such as the relaxation of age, the reservation etc. Reservation referred to in that context is referable to the reservation at the initial stage or the entry point as could be gathered from that .” E c. Thommen, J: “307. The initial appointments may be made at various levels or grades of the hierarchy in the service. There is no warrant in Article 16(4) to conclude from the expression ‘reservation of appointments or posts’ that reservation F extends not merely to the initial appointment, but to every stage of promotion. Once appointed in a service, any further discrimination in matters relating to conditions of service, such as salary, increments, promotions, retirement benefits, etc. is constitutionally impermissible, it being the very negation of equality, fairness and justice. G ***************** 309. In whichever post that a member of a backward class is appointed, reservation provisions are attracted at the stage of his initial appointment and not subsequently. H RESERVE BANK OF INDIA & ORS. v. A.K. NAIR & ORS. 809 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] Further promotions must be governed by common rules A applicable to all employees of the respective grades. Reasoning to the contrary in decisions, such as General Manager, S. Rly. v. Rangachari [(1962) 2 SCR 586 : AIR 1962 SC 36] ; State of Punjab v. Hiralal [(1970) 3 SCC 567 : (1971) 3 SCR 267] ; Akhil Bharatiya Soshit B Karamchari Sangh (Railway) v. Union of India [(1981) 1 SCC 246, 289 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 50 : (1981) 2 SCR 185, 234] is not warranted by the language of the Constitution.” ***************** d. Kuldip Singh, J C “376. The reservation permissible under Article 16(4) can only be “in favour of any backward class of citizens” and not for individuals.
