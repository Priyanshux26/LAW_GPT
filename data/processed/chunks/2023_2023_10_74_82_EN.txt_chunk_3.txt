A the right clavicle bone of Krishan and a nasal bone fracture of Brahmjit, also deposed in favour of the defence. 5. The trial court held that all the accused persons reaching the spot together armed with weapons and their attack on the victims, including the deceased exhibited the intention of an unlawful assembly, B to inflict deadly injuries. The nature of injuries found on the deceased indicated common intention of the assembly extended to causing death, which in fact, occurred. The trial court held that the prosecution’s inability to explain the injuries on the accused did not absolve them of their role in the attack and causing the death of Subhash, because the evidence relied on was credible. The evidence of two witnesses consistently supported C the prosecution case in their statements before the police as well as in court. Their testimonies were corroborated by medical evidence. The trial court3 convicted all the accused as charged and sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for life under Section 302 r/w Section 149 IPC and one-year’s rigorous imprisonment under Section 148 IPC; six months D rigorous imprisonment for the offence under Section 323 read with Section 149 IPC. 6. The accused appealed to the High Court, which by the impugned , partly allowed their pleas and converted their convictions under Section 302 read with 149 IPC to Section 304 Part II read with Section E 149 IPC. It, however, affirmed the convictions under Section 148 and Section 323 read with Section 149 IPC. The High Court observed that the lack of explanation of injuries received by Krishan and Bharmjit undermined the prosecution story and that Subash, the deceased, had received only one injury, according to PW.8- Dr. Pardeep Kumar. Finally, the High Court held that the case fell under Exception 4 to Section 300 F IPC, as tempers were running high between the parties, and a sudden fight occurred when the complainant party reached in front of Krishan’s house, which meant that the accused did not act in a pre-meditated manner. Aggrieved, the informant Uggarsain appealed to this court, against the conversion of conviction and corresponding reduction of G sentence. 7. During the hearing, this court indicated that these appeals would be confined to the extent of appropriateness of sentences undergone by 3 dated 11.02.2016 and dated 17.02.2016, in Sessions Trials No. 160 of H 30.07.2012, 275 of 04.12.2012 and 114 of 15.04.2013.
