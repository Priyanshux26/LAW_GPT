The period of subsistence of interim s passed by court has to be excluded in the computation of five years. 366.9. Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of concluded F proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of enforcement of the 2013 Act i.e. 1-1-2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of taking possession G to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.” 5. Thus, as per the law laid down by this Court for the purpose of lapsing the acquisition under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013, the twin conditions namely, not taking the possession and not paying the H 432 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A compensation have to be satisfied and if one of the conditions is not satisfied there shall not be any lapse of the acquisition. Therefore, once the possession of the land in question was taken over on 12.03.1981 then applying the law laid down by this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority (supra) the acquisition of the land in question is not deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of B the Act, 2013. Under the circumstances, the impugned and passed by the High Court is unsustainable. 6. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeal succeeds. The impugned and passed by the High Court is hereby quashed and set aside. Consequently, C the writ petition preferred by the original writ petitioner before the High Court stands dismissed. Present appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of. D Bibhuti Bhushan Bose Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Abhishek Pratap Singh, LCRA) E F G H
