30. In fact, it will be interesting here to contrast Section 353 of the IPC with Section 186 of the IPC under which Section the appellant has not been charged. Section 186 of the IPC reads as follows. “186. Obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions.- Whoever voluntarily obstructs any public servant in the discharge of his public functions, shall be 948 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.” 31. To take cognizance of Section 186, the procedure under Section 195(1)(a)(i) of the Cr.P.C. ought to have been followed. There is not even a complaint by the officer against the appellant for any offence having been committed under Section 186 of the IPC. 32. In view of the above, we have no hesitation in setting aside the of the High Court. The result would be that the appellant would stand acquitted for the offence under Section 353 of the IPC. The Conviction under Section 353 of the IPC and the sentence imposed are set aside. The appeal is allowed. The bail bonds shall stand discharged. Result of the case: Appeal Allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Aandrita Deb, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Shadan Farasat, Sr. Adv.)
