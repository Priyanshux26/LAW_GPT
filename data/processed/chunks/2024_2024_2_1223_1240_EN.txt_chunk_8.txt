19. In the decision in M. Vijayakumar v. State of Tamil Nadu10, this Court considered Section 306, IPC and its co-relation with Section 107, IPC after referring to the decisions in M. Mohan v. State represented by the Deputy Superintendent of Police11, Madan Mohan Singh v. State of Gujarat & Anr.12, and Chitresh Kumar Chopra v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi)13. After analysing the provisions under Section 306, IPC with reference to ‘abetment’, as defined under Section 107, IPC and the decisions in M. Mohan’s case (supra), Madan Mohan Singh’s case (supra) and Chitresh Kumar Chopra’s case (supra) it was held that “in to bring out an offence under Section 306, IPC specific abetment as contemplated by Section 107, IPC on the part of the accused with an intention to bring about the suicide of the person concerned as a result of that abetment is required. The intention of the accused to aid or to instigate or to abet the deceased to commit suicide is a must for this particular offence under Section 306, IPC,…” Thus, in view of the decision, it is clear that what matters in deciding the question whether there is ground for proceeding against a particular person and to issue summons to him to face the trial for the offence under Section 306, IPC is whether the complaint and the materials collected during the inquiry/investigation prima facie disclose mens rea on the part of the accused to bring about suicide of the victim. This position of law and condition Nos. 1 and 2 in Smt. Nagawwa’s case (supra), extracted in paragraph 17 above, are to be borne in mind while considering the question whether a prima facie case of ‘abetment of suicide’ is made out against the respondent No.2. Obviously, the High Court held it in the negative under the impugned . As per the complainant, who was examined before the 10 [2024] 2 SCR 1054 : 2024 SCC OnLine SC 238 11 [2011] 3 SCR 437 : (2011) 3 SCC 626 12 [2010] 10 SCR 351 : (2010) 8 SCC 628 13 [2009] 13 SCR 230 : (2009) 16 SCC 605 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 1235 Vikas Chandra v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. learned Magistrate in the inquiry, the respondent No.2 by uttering the instigative words on 12.10.2004 (extracted hereinbefore) abetted his father to commit suicide. However, the impugned would reveal that the High Court upon careful perusal of the suicide note found conspicuous absence of any reference, either explicitly or implicitly, in the suicide note regarding any such occurrence, as alleged by the complainant, on 12.10.2004 or anything suggesting that the respondent No.2 was conscious of the fact that the victim was bent upon to commit suicide in case of non-disbursement of salary and despite such knowledge he desisted disbursal of salary and instigated the victim to commit suicide. 20. As per the impugned the High Court went on to consider and held thus:- “As per mandate of this Section, there must be explicit or implicit abetment or some overt act indicative or suggestive of fact that some instigation was given for committing suicide and the applicant was having an interest in it.
