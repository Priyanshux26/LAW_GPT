Following the same, CIT(A) enhanced the assessment by fixing the unexplained income at Rs.1,44,02,560.00 for the assessment years 1987-88 to 1993-94 which was thereafter apportioned in respect of the relevant three assessment years. The pro-rata allotment of [2024] 1 S.C.R. 651 M/S Mangalam Publications, Kottayam v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Kottayam escaped income for the three assessment years as directed by CIT(A) are as follows: Sr. No. Assessment year Escaped income 1. 1990-91 Rs.24,98,755.00 2. 1991-92 Rs.23,01,204.00 3. 1992-93 Rs.20,20,895.00 Total Rs.68,20,854.00 16.2. Thus, as against the total escaped income of Rs.50,96,040.00 for the above three assessment years as quantified by the assessing officer, CIT(A) enhanced and redetermined such income at Rs.68,20,854.00. 16.3. However, it would be relevant to mention that CIT(A) in the appellate had noted that the assessee had filed its balance sheet as on 31.12.1985 while filing the return of income for the assessment year 1986-87. The next balance sheet was filed as on 31.03.1993. No balance sheet was filed in the interregnum on the ground that it could not maintain proper books of accounts as the relevant materials were seized by the department in the course of a search and seizure operation and not yet returned. CIT(A) further noted that the assessing officer had taken the balance sheet as on 31.03.1989 filed by the assessee before the South Indian Bank as the base for reconciling the accounts of the partners. It was noticed that CIT(A) in an earlier appellate dated 26.03.2002 for the assessment year 1989-90 in the assessee’s own case had held that the profit and loss account and the balance sheet furnished to the South Indian Bank were not reliable. CIT(A) in the present proceedings agreed with such finding of his predecessor and held that the unexplained portion, if any, of the increase in capital and current account balance with the assessee had to be analysed on the basis of the balance sheet filed before the assessing officer as on 31.12.1985 and as on 31.03.1993. 17. Aggrieved by the common appellate passed by the CIT(A) dated 26.02.2004, assessee preferred three separate appeals before the Tribunal which were registered as under: 652 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (i) ITA No. 282(Coch)/2004 for the assessment year 1990-91. (ii) ITA No. 283(Coch)/2004 for the assessment year 1991-92. (iii) ITA No. 284(Coch)/2004 for the assessment year 1992-93. 17.1. In the three appeals filed by the assessee, revenue also filed cross objections. 17.2. By the common dated 29.10.2004, the Tribunal allowed the appeals filed by the assessee and set aside the s of reassessment for the three assessment years as affirmed and enhanced by the CIT(A). Tribunal held that the re-examination carried out by the assessing officer was not based on any fresh material or evidence. The reassessment s could not be sustained on the basis of the balance sheet filed by the assessee before the South Indian Bank because in an earlier appeal of the assessee itself, CIT(A) had held that such balance sheet and profit and loss account furnished to the bank were not reliable.
