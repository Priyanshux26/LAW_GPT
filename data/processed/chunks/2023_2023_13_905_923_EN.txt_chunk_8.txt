(iii) Notifi cation vesting the surplus land in the State under Section 10(3) was published in the offi cial Gazette on 15.1.1979. (iv) Questioning the dated 26.11.1977, a writ petition was fi led by the fi rst respondent in the year 1986 which was dismissed, vide dated 3.1.1986, with liberty to raise the plea of jurisdiction before the Competent Authority. (v) Objection taken by the fi rst respondent came to be rejected by the Competent Authority vide dated 27.03.1987. In the it was observed that possession has already been taken. (vi) The dated 27.03.1987 was challenged through writ petition No. 9702 of 1987 wherein, on 20.08.1987, an ex parte interim was passed directing that the original petitioner shall not be dispossessed from the land in dispute. However, while disposing of the said writ petition, the question of possession was left undecided. Rather, an open-ended declaration was made that if actual possession (cid:0) MANOJ MISRA, J. (cid:1) 918 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. has not been taken by the date of commencement of the Repeal Act, 1976, the proceedings under the Ceiling Act, 1976 would abate, but if possession has been taken, they shall not abate. 21. From the facts noticed above, what is beyond controversy is, that,-- (a) 5499.29 square meter of original petitioner’s land was declared surplus on 26.11.1977 and, after notifi cation under Section 10(1) dated 9.1.1978, a notifi cation was issued on 15.1.1979 vesting the land in the State under Section 10(3) of the Ceiling Act, 1976; (b) neither the declaring the land as surplus, nor the notifi cation vesting the land in the State, was set aside or declared invalid. Even the of the Competent Authority, dated 27.03.1987, rejecting objection of the original petitioner with regard to jurisdiction of the ceiling authorities, has not been set aside. 22. Surprisingly, the issue whether possession was taken prior to the commencement of the Repeal Act, 1999, though had arisen directly for determination in writ petition No.9702 of 1987, was not decided. This issue was critical because rights of the parties were dependent on its determination. Yet, for reasons unknown, the High Court chose not to decide the same while disposing of writ petition no. 9702 of 1987. 23. The factum of possession is essentially a question of fact. Although there is no hard and fast rule that a question of fact cannot be determined in writ jurisdiction but, in the event of a serious dispute between the parties on a question of fact, a writ court ordinarily refrains from deciding it. More so, when writ petitioner has an alternative remedy where such disputed questions of fact can be decided authoritatively. 24. In the instant case, a serious dispute had arisen regarding taking of actual possession of the surplus land. According to the appellants, physical possession of the surplus land was taken on 8.3.1979, after serving notice under Section 10(5) of the Ceiling Act, 1976 on the land holder on 27.02.1979. On the other hand, according to the original petitioner actual possession of the surplus land was never taken from him though the State may have taken possession on paper.
