The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to 266 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. form an opinion and pronounce a , but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time. ….” 34. This principle popularly known as the doctrine of constructive res judicata, based on the might and ought theory, has been recognized by this Court in several s. In Maharashtra Vikrikar Karamchari Sangathan vs. State of Maharashtra and Another, (2000) 2 SCC 552, this Court held as under:- “22. It was then contended on behalf of the appellants that neither the Recruitment Rules of 1971 nor the Seniority Rules of 1982 provided for carrying forward the vacancies falling in either category. In the absence of such rules which specifi cally provide for carrying forward the vacancies falling in either category, no such carry-forward rule could be implied either in the Recruitment Rules or in the Seniority Rules. This contention need not detain us any longer because such a contention was available to the appellants in the earlier proceedings, namely, Transfer Application No. 822 of 1991 and the same was not put in issue. That not having been done, it must follow that such a contention is barred by the principles of constructive res judicata. Neither the contesting respondents nor the appellants ever raised this contention at any stage of the proceedings in Transfer Petition No. 822 of 1991. It would, therefore, be too late to raise such a contention when the seniority list has been fi nalized pursuant to the of MAT, Bombay Bench in Transfer Petition No. 822 of 1991.” Interest reipublicae ut sit fi nis litium: 35. The doctrine itself is based on public policy fl owing from the age- old legal maxim interest reipublicae ut sit fi nis litium which means that in the interest of the State there should be an end to litigation and no party ought to be vexed twice in a litigation for one and the same cause (See M. Nagabhushana vs. State of Karnataka and Others, (2011) 3 SCC 408. 36. The contention raised on behalf of the appellant that he should at least be paid the salary and allowances as paid to the Assistant Teachers in SAMIR KUMAR MAJUMDER v. 267 THE UNION OF INDIA & ORS. [K.V.VISWANATHAN, J.] the Higher Secondary Section for the time he functioned should also fail for the reason as set out herein above. Claim for continuity of service: 37. The appellant however cannot be denied continuity of service under the Master Circular dated 29.01.1991 read with the s of this Court in Smt. Jayasree Deb Roy (Dutta) (supra) [C.A. No. 9424 of 1995] and the in the appellant’s own case i.e. C.A. No. 3557 of 1996 dated 15.02.1996. This is a fresh cause of action, which has arisen in view of his absorption on 02.01.1998, subsequent to the culmination of the earlier round of proceedings.
