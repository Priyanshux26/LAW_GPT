The High Court has adopted too narrow a meaning while interpreting and/or considering section 54 of the Adhiniyam. [Para 11][113-G-H] 2. So far as quashing and setting aside the entire acquisition E proceedings including sections 4 & 6 notifications issued under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act with respect to the lands in question on the ground that there was no proper delegation of power to the Collector with regard to Section 5A of the Act, is concerned, it is required to be noted that in the present case, the State Government vide its letter dated 22.3.1985 F delegated its power to the District Collector as Deputy Secretary of the Revenue Department and to the Commissioner of the division to act as Secretary of the Revenue Department and to adjudicate matters related to land acquisition by exercising powers given under Sections 4, 5, 6 and 17 of the Act, 1894. Merely G because Section 5A has not been mentioned in the said , the entire acquisition proceedings including notifications under Sections 4 & 6 of the Act, 1894 and more particularly the declaration which was issued after considering the report/ objections under section 5A cannot be declared illegal. [Para 12][114-B-D] H 86 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A 3. A declaration under Section 6 of the Act, 1894 could be issued only after the report submitted under Section 5A has been considered by the appropriate government. Under Section 5A of the Act, the objections are required to be considered by the Collector, i.e., the Collector of a District including a Deputy Commissioner and any other officer especially appointed by the B appropriate government to perform the functions of a Collector under the Land Acquisition Act. In the present case, apart from being specially appointed by the appropriate government to perform the functions of a Collector, the authority who has considered the objections under Section 5A is the Collector of a C District. Even the State Government vide its circular dated 6.03.1987 conferred power on the Deputy Collectors for exercising the functions of the Collector for acquisition of the land in their respective areas. [Para 12.1][114-D-F] 4. When the Collector has exercised the power of the D appropriate government and a declaration under section 6 of the Act has been issued after considering the report on the objections under Section 5A of the Act, the High Court has seriously erred in quashing and setting aside the entire acquisition proceedings on the aforesaid ground. [Para 12.3][116-F] E 5. So far as the third ground on which the scheme and the entire acquisition proceedings have been set aside, namely, the huge and big chunk of land out of the total land sought to be acquired by the Development Authority which has been released, is concerned, it is required to be noted that out of the total land acquired, 68.11% of the land has been developed and 31.89% F has not been developed due to interim s passed by the Courts. Even otherwise, it is required to be noted that out of the total land covered under the scheme, i.e., 332.616 hectares (277.853 hectares of land acquired through award plus 44.763 hectares of the land owned by the Authority), land has been G released for various purposes to the extent of 54.660 hectares and still the remaining land would be to the extent of 267.956 hectares out of which the land involved in the present appeals would be to the extent of 85.430 hectares.
