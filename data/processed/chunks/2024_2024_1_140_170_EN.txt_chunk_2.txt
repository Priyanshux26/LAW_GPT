143 BHARTI AIRTEL LIMITED AND ANOTHER v. VIJAYKUMAR V. IYER AND OTHERS India – Insolvency set-off applies when demands are between the same parties – There must be commonality of identity between the person who has made the claim and the person against whom the claim exists – Even when there are several distinct and independent transactions, mutuality can exist between the same parties functioning in the same right or capacity – Mutual dealings are not so much concerned with the nature of the claims, but with the relationship and apposite identity of the parties giving rise to the respective claims, such that it would offend one’s sense of fairness or justice to allow one to be enforced without regard to the other.
