Rather, the ordinary provisions of the IPC/Drugs and Cosmetics Act and the AP Prohibition Act, as the case may be, were deemed suffi cient to deal with these situations. It is therefore submitted that the preventive detention s against the Petitioner be quashed, and he be permitted to face trial as per ordinary due process. PESALA NOOKARAJU v. THE GOVERNMENT OF 539 ANDHRA PRADESH & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] IV. The Detention s are Disproportionate and Suffer from NonApplication of Mind 4.1 A detention under S. 3(1) or 3(2) of the AP Act can only be issued only if “it is necessary so to do” to prevent a person from acting in a manner prejudicial to public . The doctrine of proportionality, which requires that the least restrictive means be used when imposing any restraint on a fundamental right, is therefore built into the statute. [See Madhyamam Broadcasting Ltd. v. Union of India & Ors., 2023 SCC OnLine SC 366 (para 85)] 4.2 In the present case, the Petitioner was granted bail in all cases against him, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the State. If the Petitioner subsequently committed any off ence or violated any condition of bail, the State ought to have approached the concerned Court for cancellation of bail. Issuance of a preventive detention which drastically curtailed the Petitioner’s right to liberty under Art. 21 is certainly neither the most suitable nor the least restrictive method of preventing the Petitioner from engaging in any further alleged criminal activity. 4.3 Without prejudice, a person ought to be preventively detained only for the period absolutely necessary in to achieve the object in question i.e. prevent public dis. While the maximum period of detention can be 12 months as per S. 13 of the AP Act, the State nevertheless has the discretion to provide for a lesser period, or even revoke/ modify a detention under S. 14. However, in the present case, Respondent No. 1 has, vide GO dated 18.10.2022, directed that the Petitioner be detained for the maximum period of 12 months without any application of mind or providing any reasons as to why this is necessary. 4.4 Further, the grounds for detention and dated 25.08.2022 were admittedly issued on the basis of a proposal dated 05.08.2022 made by the Superintendent of Police, Kakinada. A bare perusal of this proposal shows that the grounds for detention therein are identical to the grounds of detention appended to the dated 25.08.2022. It therefore appears that the dated 25.08.2022 was passed placing blind reliance on the proposal of the SP, without 540 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. any independent application of mind. The delegated power and discretion vested in the District Magistrate under S. 3(2) has virtually been further sub-delegated to the Superintendent of Police, which is impermissible. V. A Habeas Corpus Petition is Maintainable on behalf of the Petitioner 5.1 The Petitioner had preferred W.P. No. 33638/ 2022 dated 13.10.2022 before the Hon’ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh inter alia praying for the closure of his detention dated 25.08.2022 and his release from prison.
