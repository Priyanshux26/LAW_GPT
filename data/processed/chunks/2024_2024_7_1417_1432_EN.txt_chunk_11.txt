It is further clarified that after the sale of the property if any of the co-sharers fail to contribute any amount to the common kitty for distribution amongst all the co-sharers as determined by the Trial Court, the distribution of the amount so collected after the sale of the property shall be reduced to that extent from the share of that co-sharer. 25. We may notice here that the suit for partition was filed way back in the year 2005. The matter is pending at the stage of passing of preliminary decree for the last about two decades that too in a case where the share of the parties is not in dispute.

Issues regarding whom have been dealt with in this we direct the Trial Court to expedite the proceedings and dispose of the same within a period of nine months from the date of receipt of this .
