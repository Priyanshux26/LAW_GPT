Therefore, upon consideration, had the Respondent been found suitable for promotion to AVM, his superannuation would have moved forward from 57 years at which he was due to superannuate upon not being promoted. 24. The age of retirement is known to each offi cer. A direction to let the Respondent continue in service even past such age appears to be without any basis. The Tribunal did not have any power to extend this, that too for infi nity. It has been observed in Chandra Mohan Verma v. State of Uttar Pradesh18 that:- “24. The determination of the age of retirement is a matter of executive policy. The appellant attained the age of superannuation prior to the notifi cation dated 6-2-2015 and was not entitled to the benefi t of the enhancement of the age of retirement. (Emphasis supplied) 25. We also take note of a recent of this Court in Union of India v. Uzair Imran19 where the commonly accepted age of retirement has been recognised and acknowledged. It did not see past the retirement age. 26. Therefore, given that the determination of the age of superannuation is within the domain of Executive policy,of which the Tribunal was fully aware, and that, even while seeking to do complete justice, this court ought not to, in ordinary circumstances, look past the commonly accepted age of superannuation, it is clear that the of the Tribunal is sans basis. 18 (2020) 13 SCC 261 (3 Judge Bench) 19 2023 SCC OnLine 1308 (2 Judge Bench) UNION OF INDIA & ORS. v. AIR COMMODORE NK 1043 SHARMA (17038) ADM/LGL [SANJAY KAROL J.] 27. On both counts, as demonstrated the judgement and of the Tribunal, cannot stand. 28. We fi nd a further ground under which the challenge led by the Respondent, ought to have failed at the fi rst instance. 28.1 The post of JAG (Air) was upgraded to AVM in the year 2012. The previous occupant of the position superannuated in 2014 where after, the Respondent was once again appointed to such position. 28.2 The said position having fallen vacant and the Respondent, being only an offi ciating offi cer, was only considered with his course mates in the Promotion Board of 2015. In other words, he was not considered by the Air Force against the AVM JAG vacancy. 28.3 It is undisputed that the Respondent participated in the Promotion Board of 2015. It is only when after such consideration alongside other course-mates of the Adm. Branch, when he was not promoted to the rank of AVM JAG (Air)20 that he initiated the statutory complaint under Section 27 of the AF Act dated 20 April 2015. 28.4 Challenging the basis of promotion after having participated in the process on consideration of promotion and having been declared unsuccessful thereunder, is not a valid ground to impugn the policy/method. Repeatedly, this Court has held that such challenges cannot be allowed. On this, we may refer to certain past instances: – 28.4.1 In Pradeep Kumar Rai v. Dinesh Kumar Pandey21 it was observed:- “17.
