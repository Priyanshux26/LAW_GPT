the court should 928 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and need only look into one aspect—the existence of an arbitration agreement. What are the factors for deciding as to whether there is an arbitration agreement is the next question. The resolution to that is simple—it needs to be seen if the agreement contains a clause which provides for arbitration pertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the parties to the agreement. xxx xxx xxx 59. The scope of the power under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act was considerably wide in view of the decisions in SBP and Co. [SBP and Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd. (2005) 8 SCC 618] and Boghara Polyfab [National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd. (2009) 1 SCC 267 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ) 117] . This position continued till the amendment brought about in 2015. After the amendment, all that the courts need to see is whether an arbitration agreement exists—nothing more, nothing less. The legislative policy and purpose is essentially to minimise the Court’s intervention at the stage of appointing the arbitrator and this intention as incorporated in Section 11(6-A) ought to be respected. (Emphasis supplied) 58. A two Judge-Bench of this Court in Garware Wall Ropes Ltd. v. Coastal Marine Constructions & Engineering Ltd. reported in (2019) 9 SCC 209 considered the effect of Section 11(6A) which confined the jurisdiction of the Court to examine the “existence of an arbitration agreement” on an arbitration agreement contained in an unstamped document or contract. The Court was of the opinion that its enquiry as to whether a compulsorily stampable document, which contains the arbitration clause, is duly stamped or not, is only an enquiry into whether such an arbitration agreement exists in law and this does not in any manner amount to deciding “preliminary question(s)” that arise between the parties. However, in deciding so, the Court maintained that a referral court must confine itself to the question of existence of the arbitration agreement and observed as thus: “14. A reading of the Law Commission Report, together with the Statement of Objects and Reasons, shows that [2024] 9 S.C.R. 929 Ajay Madhusudan Patel & Ors. v. Jyotrindra S. Patel & Ors. the Law Commission felt that the s in SBP & Co. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd. (2005) 8 SCC 618] and Boghara Polyfab [National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd. (2009) 1 SCC 267 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ) 117] required a relook, as a result of which, so far as Section 11 is concerned, the Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under Sections 11(4) to 11(6) is to confine itself to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement and leave all other preliminary issues to be decided by the arbitrator. […]” (Emphasis supplied) 59. Once again, a three-judge bench of this Court in Vidya Drolia and Ors. v. Durga Trading Corporation reported in (2021) 2 SCC 1 held that Sections 8 and 11 respectively must be read as laying down a similar standard on the scope of the referral court’s powers.
