It is true that legislature can restrict heritability by amending or repealing the law, as the case might be. The Division Bench’s finding (in the impugned dated 08.12.2022), is that since legislature can restrict the heritability it has done precisely that in the 1997 Act, by adding the words “five years from the date of death of such tenant or from the date of coming into force of this Act, whichever is later”. Hence, as per the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court, the death of SK Mitra in 1970 also stands covered under new Act. In other words, the 1997 Act changes “heritable rights” retrospectively according to the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court. Although, the actual date when eviction would happen is post the new Act but it does have a retrospective application as well in as much as it is applicable retrospectively to an earlier date (1970 in the present case) and had taken away a right of the appellants, given to them under the old statute. Statutory laws operate from the date of their enforcement i.e., prospectively. In case the legislature intends to make a law [2024] 9 S.C.R. 667 Rajesh Mitra @ Rajesh Kumar Mitra & Anr. v. Karnani Properties Ltd. retrospective then such an intention of the legislature must be shown clearly and unambiguously in the statute itself. The Division Bench’s mere interpretation of a statutory provision will not make the law retrospective and take away the heritable rights of a tenant. 22. In view of the above, we hold that Smt. Usha Mitra and the appellants jointly inherited the tenancy from Sh. S.K. Mitra, in the year 1970. Thus, the impugned is liable to be set aside as appellants’ tenancy did not expire in the year 2006, by the introduction of 1997 Act, in the absence of a clear and unequivocal intention in the 1997 Act to have a retrospective operation. 23. Accordingly, these appeals are allowed. s dated 29.06.2022 and 08.12.2022 of the Single Judge and the Division Bench respectively are set aside. 24. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. 25. Interim (s), if any, shall stand vacated. Result of the Case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
