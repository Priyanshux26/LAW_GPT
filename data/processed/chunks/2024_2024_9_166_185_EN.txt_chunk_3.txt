Thereafter, the appellant filed a memo dated 26.04.2017 purporting to clarify the name of the village in the schedule of the agreement of sale. The said effort was opposed by the respondent, namely ex-post- facto incorporation of material details into the suit agreement; gaps in the agreement are not filled up by the appellant to the detriment of the respondent. The trial court, agreeing with the respondent’s objection, rejected the memo dated 26.04.2017. The appellant filed Writ Petition No. 8506 of 2018 challenging the trial court’s dated 12.08.2017 before the High Court of Karnataka. On 10.08.2018, the Writ Petition was disposed of, and the operative portion reads thus: “Accordingly, in modification of the impugned dated 12.08.2017, it is directed that a copy of the memo filed by the plaintiff may be sent by the Trial Court to the office of the District Registrar for appropriate proceedings in accordance with law. However, it is made clear that the and proposition with reference to the name of the village mentioned by the plaintiff/petitioner shall have relevance only [2024] 9 S.C.R. 171 Seetharama Shetty v. Monappa Shetty for the purpose of calculation of deficit stamp duty and other charges but shall have no bearing on the merit consideration of the submissions of the parties, including the submissions of the defendant/ respondent about the genuineness and the validity of the document in question and the corresponding right of the plaintiff/petitioner to contest such objections.” 7. The District Registrar, through report dated 10.11.2016, determined the deficit stamp duty payable on the instrument at Rs. 71,200/-. The trial court, by dated 23.01.2019, directed the appellant to pay the deficit stamp duty of Rs. 71,200/- and ten times penalty on the agreement of sale dated 29.06.1999. Thus, the total levy of stamp duty and penalty is Rs. 7,83,200/-. The appellant assailed the dated 23.01.2019 in O.S. NO. 295 of 2013 in Writ Petition No. 30734 of 2019 before the High Court. The Writ Petition was dismissed, and the appellant was granted four months’ time for payment of deficit stamp duty and the penalty. The appellant filed Review Petition No. 340 of 2019, and through the impugned dated 14.09.2021, the Review Petition was dismissed. Hence, the Civil Appeals have been filed questioning the s dated 23.01.2019 and 14.09.2021. 8. The learned Single Judge has, in great detail, referred to all the attending circumstances, appreciated their implication vis-à-vis the statutory obligation under the Act to pay ad valorem stamp duty on an agreement of sale satisfying the definition of a conveyance under the Act and dismissed the Review Petition. The findings, in brief, are as follows: 8.1. Section 33 of the Act requires the adjudicating authorities to impound and determine the duty payable on the suit agreement. 8.2. Section 34 of the Act provides for levy of deficit stamp duty and penalty. The Section employs the expression “ten times the amount of the proper duty or deficit portion thereof.” Therefore, there is no discretion granted to the adjudicating authorities to waive or reduce the penalty.
