[Paras 60, 64, 65] Constitution of India — Art. 19(1)(a) - Right to vote - Right to know — Significance: Held: (Per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) Right to vote is a constitutional and statutory right, grounded in Art 19(1)(a), as the casting of a vote amounts to expression of an opinion by the voter — Citizens’ right to know stems from this very right, as meaningfully exercising choice by voting requires information — Representatives elected as a result of the votes cast in their favour, enact new, and amend existing laws, and when in power, take policy decisions — Access to information which can materially shape the citizens’ choice is necessary for them to have a say — Thus, the right to know is paramount for free and fair elections and democracy — Denying voters the right to know the details of funding of political parties would lead to a dichotomous situation — Funding of political parties cannot be treated differently from that of the candidates who contest elections - Democratic legitimacy is drawn not only from representative democracy but also through the maintenance of an efficient participatory democracy — In the absence of fair and effective participation of all stakeholders, the notion of representation in a democracy would be rendered hollow. [Paras 19, 21, 22] Constitution of India - Fundamental rights — Conflict of - Voter’s right to know vis-a-vis right to privacy: Held: (Per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) Fundamental rights are not absolute, legislations/policies restricting the rights may be enacted in accordance with the scheme of the Constitution — Thread of reasonableness applies to all such restrictions — Furthermore, Art. 14 includes the facet of formal equality and substantive equality — Thus, the principle ‘equal protection of law’ requires the legislature and the executive to achieve factual equality — This principle can be extended to any restriction on fundamental rights which must be reasonable to the identified degree of harm - If the restriction is unreasonable, unjust or arbitrary, then the law should be struck down - Further, it is for the legislature to identify the degree of 436 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports harm — Voters right to know and access to information is far too important in a democratic set-up so as to curtail and deny ‘essential’ information on the pretext of privacy and the desire to check the flow of unaccounted money to the political parties. [Paras 56, 57] Elections — Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018 — Clause 7(4), 2(a) — Features of the Scheme: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya ४ Chandrachud, CuI.) (for himself and for B R Gavai, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, JJ) Scheme defines electoral bond “as a bond issued in the nature of promissory note which shall be a bearer banking instrument and shall not carry the name of the buyer or payee” — The Scheme also stipulates that the information furnished by the buyer shall be treated as confidential which shall not be disclosed by any authority except when demanded by a competent court or by a law enforcement agency upon the registration of criminal case — While it is true that the law prescribes anonymity as a central characteristic of electoral bonds, the de jure anonymity of the contributors does not translate to de facto anonymity — The Scheme is not fool-proof — There are sufficient gaps in the Scheme which enable political parties to know the particulars of the contributions made to them — Electoral bonds provide economically resourced contributors who already have a seat at the table selective anonymity vis-a-vis the public and not the political party.
