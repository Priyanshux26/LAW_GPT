Having regard to the history of the amendments, their impact on the social and economic [2024] 8 S.C.R. 553 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. affairs of our country and the chaotic situation that may be brought about by the sudden withdrawal at this stage of the amendments from the Constitution, we think that considerable judicial restraint is called for. We, therefore, declare that our decision will not affect the validity of the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, or other amendments made to the Constitution taking away or abridging the fundamental rights. We further declare that in future the Parliament will have no power to amend Part III of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights.” (emphasis added) 11. Although Golak Nath (supra) was subsequently overruled in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala,11 the doctrine of prospective overruling has been accepted by this Court. This Court has applied the doctrine in varied contexts. The following principles emerge on the application of the doctrine: a. The power of this Court to mould the relief claimed to meet the justice of the case is derived from Article 142;12 b. It is applied by this Court while overruling its earlier decision, which was otherwise final. It has also been applied when deciding on an issue for the first time;13 c. The object is to validate all the actions taken before the date of declaration in the larger public interest.14 The doctrine does not validate an invalid law, but the declaration of invalidation takes effect from a future date;15 d. Cases that have attained finality are saved because doing otherwise would cause unnecessary and avoidable hardships;16 e. It is applied to bring about a smooth transition of the operation 11 [1973] Supp. 1 SCR 1 : (1973) 4 SCC 225 12 Belsund Sugar Co. Ltd. v.

It is a device innovated to avoid: (i) reopening settled issues, (ii) refund of amounts collected under invalid legislation, and (iii) multiplicity of proceedings;18 and g. It is applied to avoid social and economic disruptions and give sufficient time to the affected entities and institutions to make appropriate changes and adjustments.19 12. This Court has often used its powers under Article 142 to limit the retroactivity of its decisions. In Union of India v. Mohd. Ramzan Khan,20 a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that non-furnishing of an enquiry report to a delinquent employee would amount to a violation of the rules of natural justice.
