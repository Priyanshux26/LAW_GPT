21. Besides that, before recording conviction, the court must be satisfied that the accused ‘must be’ and not merely ‘may be’ guilty. In Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade vs. State of Maharashtra,9 this Court, elaborating upon the above principle, observed that the mental distance between ‘may be’ and ‘must be’ is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions. Therefore, even if the prosecution evidence generates strong suspicion against the accused, it cannot be a substitute for proof. 7 See: Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra (1984) 4 SCC 116; Hanumat Govind Nargundkar v. State of Madhya Pradesh AIR 1952 SC 343; Santosh @ Bhure versus State (G.N.C.T) of Delhi, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 538 8 [2019] 1 SCR 168 : (2019) 19 SCC 447 9 [1974] 1 SCR 489 : (1973) 2 SCC 793 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1247 Suresh Chandra Tiwari & Anr. v. State of Uttarakhand 22. Bearing in mind the aforesaid legal principles, we would examine and consider – (a) whether the circumstances relied by the prosecution have been proved beyond reasonable doubt; (b) whether those circumstances are of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused; (c) whether those circumstances taken cumulatively form a chain so far complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused; (d) whether they are consistent only with the hypothesis of the accused being guilty; and (e) whether they exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved. CIRCUMSTANCES RELIED BY THE PROSECUTION 23. The prosecution case rests on the following circumstances: (i) Accused-appellant no.1 and the deceased had supported rival candidates in the last panchayat elections held in 1996, and on 19.01.1997 accused – appellant no.1 had threatened the deceased in a Gram Sabha meet, therefore there existed motive for the crime. (ii) The deceased was last seen alive on 2.2.1997, at about 4.30 PM, with the accused-appellants by PW-4. (iii) According to PW-3, whilst accused-appellants were at his shop on 2.2.1997, at about 6.30 PM, they were looking for the deceased. (iv) In the night hours of 2.2.1997, the accused-appellants were noticed walking on the pathway in front of Mohan Singh’s shop from where deceased’s body with multiple ante-mortem injuries, confirming a homicidal death, was recovered next day morning. (v) A polythene bag containing meat was recovered from the place where belongings of the deceased were littered. Testimony of PW-6 proved that accused-appellant no.1 had purchased 1 kg of meat on 2.2.1997 at about 3.30 PM. (vi) On the disclosure made by the accused-appellants, as well as at their pointing out, on 6.2.1997 blood-stained stone(s) were recovered which might have been used to inflict head injury to the deceased, resulting in his death. 1248 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 24. We shall now deal with each of the above circumstances separately. MOTIVE 25. Though prosecution has been successful in establishing that in 1996 panchayat elections the deceased and accused-appellant no.1 had supported rival candidates, but it could lead no concrete evidence as regards any untoward incident precipitating the crime in question.
