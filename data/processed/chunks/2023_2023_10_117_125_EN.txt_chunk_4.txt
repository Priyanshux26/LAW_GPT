Thereafter the management of FCI issued a corrigendum on A 27.11.2000, which is of great significance. The corrigendum reads thus: ‘THE FOOD CORPORATION OF INDIA REGIONAL OFFICE, PATNA-1 REF:NO.ESTT.30[88]/94-VOL.-II DATED:27.11.2000 B CORRIGENDUM In the office issued under reference of even no. dated 10/17.11.2000 regarding re-instatement of S/Sri Shashi Shankar and 20 others Casual workers of FSD, Chandauti, the word “re- instated” as mentioned in line 6 of the said Office may be C read as “absorbed” Sd/- Regional Manager …’ D 12. Notably, all that was required of the management of FCI, as per the interim dated 05.08.1999 in CWJC No. 953 of 1998 (R), was that it should pay the full wages last drawn by the workmen concerned, pending the disposal of the said writ petition, in due compliance with Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Thereafter, the E final dated 12.05.2000 passed in MJC Case No. 371 of 2000 only put the management on notice that if it failed to comply with the conditional stay within two weeks, the said would stand vacated and the workmen would be at liberty to seek implementation of the Award. Faced with this situation, the management of FCI could have paid the wages F last drawn to the workmen concerned after ascertaining the same. That would have sufficed for continued subsistence of its interim protection during the pendency of the writ petition. However, the management of FCI did not choose to adopt this course of action. In its wisdom, the management not only reinstated the workmen concerned, under the Office s dated 10/17.11.2000 and 24/26.11.2000, but went one step further G and issued the Corrigendum dated 27.11.2000, ‘absorbing’ the said workmen in regular service. In effect, the management of FCI voluntarily chose to implement the Award in its totality, despite the conditional interim protection afforded to it in the writ petition. H 124 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 13. The feeble plea of the management of FCI that it was compelled to comply with the Award, under the threat of contempt, cannot be accepted as the contempt proceedings in MJC Case No.
