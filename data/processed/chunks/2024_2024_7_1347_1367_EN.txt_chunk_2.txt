Satyanarayana (original vendees) entered into an agreement to sell dated 24.05.1981 with Muni Venkata Reddy and his four sons (original vendors) for sale of Survey No.129, New No.220/01, Site No.14 situated at Kodihali Village, HAL, S.B. Area, Bangalore-17 measuring East to West 132 feet and North to South 40 feet total 5280 sq. feet (hereinafter referred to as the “property in dispute”). The total sale consideration was stated to be Rs.29,000/- , out of which, an advance of Rs.12,000/- was paid at the time of agreement to sell dated 24.05.1981. The balance amount was to be paid at the time of registration of the sale deed. The necessity for sale had arisen because of want of funds by the vendors. The stipulated period was fixed as three months, but as there were restrictions of registration of sale deeds with respect to similar revenue sites and survey numbers, as such, the sale deed would be executed immediately after the cancellation of the said Government . The agreement to sell also mentioned that possession of the site would be given that very day. 4. After expiry of three months from the date of agreement, when the plaintiffs did not come forward to get the sale deed executed, the defendant no.1 sent communication dated 23.09.1981 to the plaintiff stating that he has not come forward to solve the problem as the decision to sell was only because of his financial problems.
