The Special Leave Petition arising from the said was dismissed by this Court on 30.1.2017. 4 Madan Lal v. State of J&K (1995) 3 SCC 486; Dhananjay Malik v. State of Uttaranchal (2008) 4 SCC 171; Ramesh Chandra Shah v. Anil Joshi (2013) 11 SCC 309; Anupal Singh v State of Uttar Pradesh (2020) 2 SCC 173 5 Krishna Rai v Banaras Hindu University (2022) 8 SCC 713 6 (2019) 20 SCC 17 552 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 22. In the above context, a Constitution Bench of this Court in Daryao v State of UP7 (for short “Daryao”) unanimously held that the principle of res judicata is one of universal application and since the final is binding on the parties thereto, an applicant under Article 226 cannot apply on the same grounds under Article 32, without getting the adverse set aside in appeal. However, a distinction was made between cases where the application under Article 226 has been dismissed on merits and cases where it is dismissed on a preliminary ground. It was further held that an Article 32 petition would not be maintainable on the same facts and the same grounds. 23. The above ratio cannot however be applied stricto sensu in the present facts. This is for the reason that it is not the same writ petitioner who has approached this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution. The Court here is confronted with a different set of facts, another set of litigants who have raised additional contentions. Therefore, the submission of Mr. Pawanshree Agrawal, learned counsel for the writ petitioner that the writ petition should not be dismissed on the ground of res-judicata, is found to be more reasonable. In any case, the dismissal of a Special Leave Petition has no consequence on the question of law8. 24. Let us now address the fundamental question as to whether prescribing minimum marks for interview contravenes the ratio in All India Judges (2002). To do this, it is necessary to bear in mind the following contextual background. V. GENESIS OF THE SHETTY COMMISSION 25. In 1989, the All-India Judges’ Association and its working President filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India seeking various reliefs for members of the District Judiciary focusing on uniformity in service conditions. On 13.11.1991, a three-judge bench speaking through Ranganath Misra CJ disposed of the said writ petition in All India Judges Association v Union of India9, after considering, inter alia, the issues relating to pay scales and service conditions of the District Judiciary. The Supreme Court directed 7 [1962] 1 SCR 574 : AIR 1961 SC 1457 8 Inderjit Singh Sodhi v. Chairman, Punjab State Electricity Board (2021) 1 SCC 198. 9 [1991] Supp. 2 SCR 206 : (1992) 1 SCC 119 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 553 Abhimeet Sinha & Ors. v. High Court of Judicature at Patna & Ors. States and Union Territories to separately examine and review the pay structure. Aggrieved by the aforesaid , the Union of India and few State Governments filed review petitions before this Court.
