10 (2015) 1 SCC 115 11 (2017) 12 SCC 699 12 (2004) 4 SCC 158 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1561 P. Manikandan v. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors. (iii) Power under Section 386(b) of the Cr.P.C. does not include the power to direct de novo investigation in case of an appeal against conviction. (iv) It was further submitted that an acquittal may be characterized as ‘honorable’ when, after a thorough examination of the prosecution’s evidence, the court determines that the prosecution has entirely failed to substantiate the charges brought against the accused. In such circumstances, it may be inferred that the accused has been acquitted in a manner that implies full exoneration from blame. (v) In furtherance of the submissions, the learned counsel for appellant relied upon various decisions of this court viz. T.P. Gopalkrishnan v. State of Kerala,13 Subrata Choudhury alias Santosh Choudhury and Ors. v. State of Assam & Anr.,14 Amandeep Singh Saran v. State of Chhattisgarh,15 Deputy Inspector General of Police V. S. Samuthiram,16 Union Territory, Chandigarh Administration & Ors. v. Pradeep Kumar & Anr., Ajay Kumar Ghoshal & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Anr..17 10. The stand of the respondent/CBI as reflected from record is as under: (i) It was stated that the acquittal or discharge of the appellant was not based on the merits of the case. The acquittal passed by the High Court does not have the effect of the final acquittal, as the appellate proceedings did not result in a determination by affirming the conviction or an acquittal on merits. The proceedings constitute a continuation of the trial against the appellant. Accordingly, the principle of double jeopardy under Article 20 (2) of the Constitution of India and Section 300 of Cr.P.C. does not apply. (ii) The circumstances of this case do not meet the condition provided under Section 300 of Cr.P.C., in to comply with the provision under Section 300 of Cr.P.C, the previous trial must pertain to the same offence and the same charges, and 13 (2022)14 SCC 323 14 2024 SCC Online SC 3126 15 (2024) 6 SCC 541 16 (2013) 1 SCC 598 17 (2017) 12 SCC 699 1562 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the resulting of conviction or acquittal must be final and in force. The protection against double jeopardy, known as “autrefois acquit,” provided under Section 300, is not absolute and is subject to the conditions specified in Sub-sections (2) to (5) of Section 300 CrPC. (iii) Given the specific circumstances of the case, the accused can be retried for the same offence, as the previous trial has been annulled. Consequently, there is no subsisting acquittal or conviction in effect. (iv) Further it was stated that the High Court has the power under Section 368 of Cr.P.C to a new trial on the same offence or amend the charges and the Appellate Court has the power under Section 386 of Cr.P.C, in pursuance of the decisions laid down in Ajay Kumar Ghoshal & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Anr.,18 Ukha Kolhe v. State of Maharashtra,19 Mohd.
