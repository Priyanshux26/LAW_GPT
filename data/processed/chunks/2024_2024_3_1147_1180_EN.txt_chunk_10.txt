In this context we will examine how obscenity is understood. 13. Recounting the development through judicial precedents: This Court upheld the constitutional validity of Section 292 as a reasonable restriction on free speech and applied the Hicklin test21 to determine whether the book ‘Lady Chatterley’s Lover’ was obscene in the decision of Ranjit D. Udeshi v. State of Maharashtra.22 As per the 19 Sharat Babu Digumarti (supra) 20 ibid. 21 (1868) LR 3 QB 360 22 [1965] 1 SCR 65 : AIR 1965 SC 881 : 1964 INSC 171 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1161 Apoorva Arora & Anr. Etc. v. State (Govt. of Nct of Delhi) & Anr. Hicklin test, a material is obscene if it has the tendency to deprave and corrupt the minds of those who are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands the publication is likely to fall:23 “… I think the test of obscenity is this, whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall … it is quite certain that it would suggest to the minds of the young of either sex, or even to persons of more advanced years, thoughts of a most impure and libidinous character.” 14. This test lays emphasis on the potentiality of the material to deprave and corrupt by immoral influences.24 To determine this, the Court must apply itself to consider each work at a time. It must take an overall view of the obscene matter in the setting of the whole work but also consider the obscene matter by itself and separately to find out whether it is so grossly obscene and it is likely to deprave and corrupt. A mere stray word or insignificant passage would not suffice to qualify the material as obscene.25 The Court also clarified that sex and nudity in art and literature cannot in and of themselves be regarded as evidence of obscenity without something more.26 Sex must be treated in manner that is offensive to public decency and morality, when judged by our national standards, and must be likely to pander to lascivious, prurient, sexually precocious minds, and appeal to or have the tendency to appeal to the “carnal side of human nature” for it to be obscene.27 15. The Court also emphasised its role in maintaining a delicate balance between protecting freedom of speech and artistic freedom on the one hand, and public decency and morality on the other. It held that when art and obscenity are mixed, the art must be so preponderating that the obscenity is pushed into the shadows or is trivial and 23 ibid, para 14 24 ibid, para 19 25 ibid, 20, 21 26 ibid, para 16 27 ibid, paras 21 and 22 1162 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports insignificant and can be overlooked.28 Similarly, if the matter has a preponderating social purpose and gain that overweighs the obscenity of the content (such as medical textbooks), then such material is constitutionally protected by freedom of speech and cannot be criminalised as obscene.29 16.
