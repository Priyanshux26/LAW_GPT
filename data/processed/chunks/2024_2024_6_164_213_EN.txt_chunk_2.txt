[Para 46] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Inapplicable when fact in question capable of being known not only to the accused but also to others: Held: s.106 has no application to cases where the fact in question, having regard to its nature, is such as to be capable of being known not only to the accused but also to others, if they happened to be present when it took place – The intention underlying the act or conduct of any individual is seldom a matter which can be conclusively established; it is indeed only known to the person in whose mind the intention is conceived – Therefore, if the prosecution has established that the character and circumstance of an act suggest that it was done with a particular intention, then under illustration (a) to this section, it may be assumed that he had that intention, unless he proves the contrary. [Para 47] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Conduct of the accused though relevant u/s.8, however, it alone cannot form the basis of conviction: Held: Although the conduct of an accused may be a relevant fact u/s.8, yet the same, by itself, cannot be a ground to convict him or hold him guilty and that too, for a serious offence like murder – Like any other piece of evidence, the conduct of an accused is also one of the circumstances which the court may take into consideration along with the other evidence on record, direct or indirect – Thus, the conduct of the accused alone, though may be relevant u/s.8 cannot form the basis of conviction. [Para 61] Evidence – Distinction between burden of proof and burden of explanation – Discussed. [Para 48] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge – Crimes committed in complete secrecy – Difficulty faced by prosecution to lead direct evidence: 168 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: Cases are frequently coming before the courts where the husband, due to strained marital relations and doubt as regards the character, has gone to the extent of killing his wife – These crimes are generally committed in complete secrecy inside the house and it becomes very difficult for the prosecution to lead evidence – No member of the family even if he is a witness of the crime, would come forward to depose against another family member – If an offence takes place inside the four walls of a house where the accused has all the opportunity to plan and commit the offence at a time and in the circumstances of his choice, it will be extremely difficult for the prosecution to lead direct evidence to establish the guilt of the accused – It is to resolve such a situation that s.106 exists in the statute book. [Paras 54, 55] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.161(1), 162(1) – Evidence Act, 1872 – s.145: Held: Statement made by a witness before the police u/s.161(1) can be used only for the purpose of contradicting such witness on what he has stated at the trial as laid down in the proviso to s.162(1) – Court cannot suo motu make use of statements to police not proved and ask questions with reference to them which are inconsistent with the testimony of the witness in the court – The words ‘if duly proved’ used in s.162 clearly show that the record of the statement of witnesses cannot be admitted in evidence straightaway, nor can be looked into, but they must be duly proved for the purpose of contradiction by eliciting admission from the witness during cross-examination and also during the cross-examination of the IO – The statement before the IO can be used for contradiction but only after strict compliance with s.145 of the Evidence Act, that is, by drawing attention to the parts intended for contradiction.
