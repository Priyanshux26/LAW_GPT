This fact further gets corroborated with the statement of PW 6 also that the statement of the accused was C recorded after arrest and while in custody. Thus, it cannot be said that the statement of the accused confessing the crime was voluntarily made under the provisions of the Act.” (emphasis supplied) 13. There is a serious doubt with respect to the seizure. P.W.5 D who was a police officer himself had deposed on the existence of the very same seized materials even before the occurrence. This testimony which destroys the very basis of the prosecution case has not even been challenged. 14. Both the Courts have mechanically placed reliance on the E FSL Report while taking the statement of P.W.11 as the gospel truth. The views expressed by him can at best be taken as opinion at least on certain aspects. There are too many material irregularities which create a serious doubt on the very case of the prosecution. On a proper analysis we have no hesitation in holding that the impugned s are liable to be set aside and the appellant is to be acquitted by rendering the F benefit of doubt. 15. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The conviction and sentence rendered by the Additional Sessions Judge, Special Court NDPS, Jaora, District Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh in Special Sessions No. 19/2010 as confirmed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in Criminal Appeal G No. 6163 of 2017 stands set aside. The appellant is acquitted of all the charges. Bond, if any, shall stand discharged. Divya Pandey Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Shevali Monga, LCRA) H
