The former has to stand the test of a levy being in accordance with law on power derived from one of the constitutional entries. Since Synthetics and Chemicals case [Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of U.P. (1990) 1 SCC 109] finally brought down the curtain in respect of industrial alcohol by taking it out of the purview of either Entry 8 or 51 of List II of Seventh Schedule the competency of the State to frame any legislation to levy any tax or duty is excluded. But by that a provision enacted by the State for supervision which is squarely covered under Entry 33 of the Concurrent List which deals with production, supply and distribution which includes regulation cannot be assailed. The bench in Synthetics and Chemicals case [Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of U.P. (1990) 1 SCC 109] made it clear that even though the power to levy tax or duty on industrial alcohol vested in the Central Government the State was still left with power to lay down regulations to ensure that non-potable alcohol, that is, industrial alcohol, was not diverted and misused as substitute for potable alcohol. This is enough to justify a provision like Section 58-A.” 1966 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports This decision was followed by another two-Judge Bench in Gujchem Distillers India v. State of Gujarat.38 17. In State of AP v. McDowell,39 the prohibition of sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor in the State of Andhra Pradesh was challenged. The petitioners submitted that the State did not have the competence to prohibit consumption. For this purpose, reference was made to the observations in paragraph 85 of Synthetics (7J) (supra), where the Court had observed that after the enactment of IDRA, the power to issue licenses to manufacture both potable and non-potable liquor vested in Parliament. The three-Judge Bench rejected the argument by referring to observations in paragraph 86(a) Synthetics (7J) (supra) that States have the power to enact legislation in the nature of prohibiting potable liquor.40 In Vam Organic Chemicals v. State of UP41 [“Vam Organic I”], the rules issued under the UP Excise Act providing for power to issue licenses for denaturation of spirit and levy of denaturing fee was challenged. Justice A M Ahmadi (as the learned Chief Justice then was) writing for the two-Judge Bench noted that Synthetics (7J) (supra) did not hold that the State will not have any power over ‘industrial alcohol’.42 Specifically, the two-Judge Bench referred to the observations in paragraph 86(b) that the State may lay down regulations to ensure that non-potable alcohol is not misused as a substitute for potable alcohol. Justice Ahmadi observed that the process of denaturing was to ensure it was not misused as potable alcohol which would be covered by the observations in Synthetics (7J) (supra).43 18. In Bihar Distillery v. Union of India,44 the petitioner challenged the State’s cancellation of their license for preparing “rectified spirit” on the ground that the State lacked competence in view of 38 [1992] 1 SCR 675 : (1992) 2 SCC 399 39 [1996] 3 SCR 721 : (1996) 3 SCC 709 40 (1996) 3 SCC 709 [33] 41 [1997] 1 SCR 403 : (1997) 2 SCC 715 42 [1997] 1 SCR 403 : (1997) 2 SCC 715 [13] 43 (1997) 2 SCC 715 [13,14] “14.
