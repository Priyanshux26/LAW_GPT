In view of the uncertainty regarding the achievement of the “Effective Date” under Clauses 7.6.2 and 7.6.4 of the Resolution Plan, it was clarified that the same would be fixed on the 90th day from the Plan Approval dated 22.06.2021. Respondent No.1 was also given liberty to approach the NCLT for appropriate s with respect to an extension of the timeline, subject to a maximum of another 180 days, in case they fail to fulfill all the Conditions Precedent within 90 days. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow: “33. During the hearing, the uncertainty of the time frame for implementation of the Resolution Plan was discussed. It is stated by the SRA in clause no. 7.6.2 (pdf 276) of the Resolution Plan that the effective date would mean the date of the fulfilment of all the conditions precedent as stated in clause 7.6.1 thereof. The SRA, at clause no. 7.6.4, has gone on to add that the consortium would make all endeavor to ensure all the compliances are done for the fulfillment of the conditions precedent within a period of 90 days. In the unlikely event that the conditions precedent are not complied within this period, SRA would require a maximum of 180 days more to fulfil the conditions. Failing which the Resolution Plan would stand automatically withdrawn without any further act, deed or thing. In view of such uncertainty in the ‘effective date’ the Bench suggested that let the effective date be the 90th day from the Approval Date (clause 3.1 at pdf page 201). The SRA as well as the Applicant (RP of the Corporate Debtor) had agreed to the suggestion. This in our opinion is not in the nature of a substitution or addition to the decision, commercial or otherwise, of the CoC. The suggestion is made only to give finality and certainty to the effective date, which the SRA has otherwise committed in the Resolution Plan to endeavor to do. It could accordingly be ed so. Failing [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2077 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. which the SRA / Corporate Debtor would be at liberty to approach this Authority for appropriate s with regard to extension of the timeline, as would be deemed proper. That would help prevent the SRA from the frustration of ‘automatic withdrawal’ referred to in clause 7.6.4 of the Resolution Plan.” (emphasis supplied) 6. Since the initial period of 90 days for fulfilment of the Conditions Precedent expired on 22.09.2021, an extension of another 90 days was granted by the NCLT vide dated 29.09.2021 (1st extension). The 1st extension of 90 days expired on 22.12.2021. The NCLT vide dated 20.01.2022, again, granted an extension of another 90 days (2nd extension). The 2nd extension of 90 days expired on 22.03.2022. The maximum extension that could have been provided under Clause 7.6.4 of the Resolution Plan i.e., an additional 180 days, had now come to an end. However, vide dated 11.04.2022, the NCLT granted exclusion of a period of 65 days from 17.01.2022 to 22.03.2022, which was spent in moving the application for grant of time.
