The Respondent had also relied upon the sale-deed dated 04/05/1999 at Exh.40, which is a post notification transaction. The said sale-deed as well as sale-deeds dated 11/06/1998 at Exh.41 and 15/07/1998 at Exh. 42 relate to plot Nos.117, 162 and 12 respectively carved out from Survey No.6, 7 and 60 of village Akoli (khurd), which was converted to non-agricultural land way back in the year 1982. These sale-deed plots were sold at the rate of Rs. 50-60 per sq.ft. It is not in dispute that these sale-deed plots are situated in village Akoli khurd which is separate from village Hingana by a bullock cart track. These sale-deed plots were small in size and were suitable for construction purpose. Moreover, these sale-deed plots were away from the river bank and were not prone to getting submerged during rainy season or floods. 12. As compared to the sale-deed land, the acquired land is a vast track of agricultural land, along the river bank and was prone to getting inundated during rainy season and hence was not suitable for construction purpose. On account of these dissimilarities, the acquired land would not have fetched the same price as that of the sale-deed land. The above stated disadvantageous 2284 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports factors possessed by the acquired land would warrant appropriate deductions. 13. The above referred sale-deed plots were sold in the year 1998 at the rate of Rs. 50-60 per sq.ft.. Considering the fact that the notification under Section 4 is of the year 1999, and further considering increase in the price of land at 10% per annum, the rate of these developed plots can be considered at Rs.60/- per sq.ft. upon deducting 30% towards development charges, 30% towards the difference in area and 15% in view of disadvantageous location of the acquired land vis-a-vis the sale-deed land, the price works out to Rs.15/- per sq. ft.” So holding, the compensation was fixed at Rs. 15/- per sq. ft. The High Court not only deducted 30% towards development charges, which we find is unjustified, it further went on to deduct 30% towards the difference in area and 15% in view of the disadvantageous location. 88. We notice that the State is not in the Appeal in this matter and there is no dispute about the applicability of the exemplars Exh.41 dated 11.06.1998 and Exh.42 dated 15.07.1998 to determine the base value. We also note that the appellant’s own witness PW 3 and 4 deposed in cross-examination that the land could not be put to non-agricultural use. The appellant did not re-examine them. 89. While we do not fault the of the High Court in fixing Rs. 60/- per sq. ft and applying 30% towards difference in area, we feel that further deduction towards development charges while the acquisition was for the construction of the wall involving no development and further 15% due to disadvantageous location was completely unjustified. Hence, we award the compensation for the land in question in this Appeal @ of Rs.
