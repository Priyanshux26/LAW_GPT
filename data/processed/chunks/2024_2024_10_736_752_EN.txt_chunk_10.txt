751 Union of India v. Pranav Srinivasan citizens of India by operation of Section 9(1). Therefore, there was no occasion for Pranav’s parents to renounce their citizenship on 20th April 2012 by the mode provided under Section 8(1) as they had already ceased to be citizens of India on 19th December 1998 when they voluntarily acquired the citizenship of Singapore. As Pranav’s parents ceased to be citizens of India, not voluntarily but by the operation of Section 9(1), Section 8(2) does not apply to Pranav. Therefore, Section 8(2) will not assist Pranav. 21. In the case of State of U.P. v. Dr. Vijay Anand Maharaj,3 this Court held thus: “8. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . . … .. .. . ….. The fundamental and elementary rule of construction is that the words and phrases used by the legislature shall be given their ordinary meaning and shall be construed according to the rules of grammar. When a language is plain and unambiguous and admits of only one meaning, no question of construction of a statute arises, for the Act speaks for itself. It is a well- recognized rule of construction that the meaning must be collected from the expressed intention of the legislature.” (emphasis added) The language used in the provisions of the 1955 Act is plain and simple. Hence, the same should be given ordinary and natural meaning. Moreover, we are dealing with a law which provides for the grant of citizenship of India to foreign nationals. There is no scope to bring equitable considerations while interpreting such a statute. As the language of Sections 5, 8 and 9 is plain and simple, there is no scope for its liberal interpretation. Citizenship of India cannot be conferred on foreign citizens by doing violence to the plain language of the 1955 Act. 22. Now, only clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act survives for consideration. However, under the said provision, Pranav can apply for Indian citizenship provided he is an ordinary resident of India for twelve months immediately preceding the date of application. 3 [1963] 1 SCR 1 : (1962) 45 ITR 414 : 1962 SCC OnLine SC 12 752 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports There is a power to relax the period of twelve months vested in the Central Government if it is satisfied that special circumstances exist. That is the provision in sub-section (1A) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act. We may note here that it is not the case made out that Pranav fulfils the criteria in clause (g) of Section 5(1) of the 1955 Act. 23. Therefore, the view taken by the High Court was completely erroneous as the High Court held that Pranav had resumed Indian citizenship under sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the 1955 Act. 24. Some arguments were made that this Court should exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. The power under Article 142 is an extraordinary power which should be exercised to deal with exceptional circumstances.
