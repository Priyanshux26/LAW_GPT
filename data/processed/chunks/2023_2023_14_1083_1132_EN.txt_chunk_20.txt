In the absence of following, the contention that there was a valid survey conducted cannot be accepted. Yet another reason for this conclusion is that the institutions required to conduct the survey under Rule 11 were not in place and were not functioning at the relevant time in 2013 and 2018. 61. The Amicus Curiae had pointedly brought out the nature of data collected by the 2013 and 2018 surveys, which appear to be inconsistent 42 (2021 SCC OnLine Bom 3002) 111 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. and contradictory on the face of it. To this end, the table submitted by the Amicus Curiae during arguments would itself demonstrate that the data collected in 2013 and 2018 were not consistent: State As per As per As per As per reply Union of NCSK’s 2013 2018 reply dt. dt.24.07.2019 India’s affi davit dt.

A few comments on the data are required here. A partial survey seems to have been conducted in Karnataka in 2020 which revealed the presence of 7493 manual scavengers. However, the 2013 survey stated that there were only 732 manual scavengers and the 2018 survey stated that there were 1754 manual scavengers. The exponential increase of the number DR. BALRAM SINGH v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 1113 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] of manual scavengers from 2013 to 2018 and then in 2020, considerably reduces the credibility of both the 2013 and 2018 surveys. 63. Another reason for this court’s skepticism about the survey is the comparison of the survey of manual scavengers with the survey on insanitary latrines. This data was provided by the cantonment boards in pursuance of the s of this court. The Cantonment Boards stated that they have demolished 574 insanitary latrines in Agra, 153 in Jabalpur and 12 in Jammu. However, they stated that there were no manual scavengers in their jurisdiction. By their very nature, insanitary latrines are serviced by manual scavengers. The manual scavengers which were servicing these insanitary latrines were clearly missed by the 2013 and 2018 surveys. As stated above, the survey under Section 11 read with Rule 11(2), provides that the SLSC and the DLSCs shall carry out adequate campaigns in all areas especially in all such areas where insanitary latrines are found. 64. The above statistics demonstrate that the number of manual scavengers identifi ed in the 2013 Survey were substantially lower than the number of manual scavengers identifi ed in the 2018 Survey.
