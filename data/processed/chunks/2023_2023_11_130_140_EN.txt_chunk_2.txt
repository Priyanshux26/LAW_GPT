Anusuya7. During the subsistence of his marriage with Anusuya, he married the appellant no.1 herein8. Appellants No. 2 and 3 are the off spring of the deceased and appellant no. 1. On 25th January, 1984, the deceased was discharged from service at his request and was granted service pension at the rate of ` 376/- (Rupees three hundred seventy six only) per month. On 15th November, 1990, the deceased and Anusuya were granted a decree of divorce by mutual consent9 and he paid a lumpsum amount of ` 15,000/- (Rupees fi fteen thousand only) to her. Thereafter, the deceased approached the respondent No. 2 for deleting the name of Anusuya and endorsing the name of the appellant No. 1 in the PPO. He also submitted a certifi cate10 issued by the Village Sarpanch, Gram Panchayat Bahirewadi, certifying that he and the appellant No. 1 had got married along with a copy of their wedding card as proof of the marriage. 3.2. Subedar Bhave expired in the year 200111. Thereafter, appellant No. 1 approached the respondents for grant of family pension12. The said request was, however, rejected by the respondents13 on the ground that the deceased had got divorced in November, 1990, whereas the appellant No.1 claimed to have got married to him in February, 1981, during the subsistence of the earlier marriage. 3.3. In 2005, the appellants instituted a civil suit for declaration praying inter alia for issuing directions to the respondents to disburse the pensionary benefi ts payable on the demise of the deceased, Subedar Bhave. As noticed above, the trial Court decreed the said suit in favour of the appellants and held that they were entitled to receive the terminal benefi ts of the deceased, 5 On 21st July, 1960 6 On 26th January, 1975 7 On 17th March, 1975 8 On 21st February, 1981 9 M.C.

Aggrieved by the said , the respondents preferred an appeal14, which was allowed and the and decree passed by the learned Civil Judge was set aside. The said was assailed by the appellants in a Regular Second Appeal15 that came to be dismissed by the High Court. Subsequently, on the basis of the Review Application, the court clarifi ed16 that the appellants No. 2 and 3 herein would be entitled to the estate of Late Subedar Bhave which is in the custody of the respondents. 4. Mr. Rahul Joshi, learned counsel, appearing for the appellants has contended that High Court erred in holding that the appellant No. 1 cannot be declared as the wife of the deceased Subedar Bhave, on the ground that their marriage had taken place during the subsistence of his marriage with Anusuya. He submitted that the embargo placed under Section 5(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 195517 that recognizes a marriage solemnized between any two Hindus on the condition that neither party has a spouse living at the time of marriage, would not prejudice the case of the appellant No.
