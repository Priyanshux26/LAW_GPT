Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the relevant referred record. 12. Even from the documents placed on record by the appellant, it is evident that MoU was entered into between the parties on 15.04.1998 with reference to House No.7/89, Tilak Nagar, Kanpur. It was mentioned therein that the aforesaid property is in dispute and the respondent No. 1 has 3/4th share in the property. Though the Trial Court had decided against respondent No. 1, however, the appeal is pending in the High Court. Though sale 13 (2017) 5 SCC 178: 2017: INSC:161 14 (2020) 14 SCC 110: 2019: INSCC:1291 ELDECO HOUSING AND INDUSTRIES LIMITED v. ASHOK 879 VIDYARTHI AND OTHERS [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] consideration of ₹4,000/- per square yard was mentioned, however, the same was to be fi nally determined after decision of appeal by the High Court. The sale deed was to be registered only after the litigation is decided in favour of respondent No. 1. The earnest money of ₹10,00,000/- was proposed to be paid in instalments. It was followed by a subsequent MoU signed between the parties on 31.08.1998 (registered on 01.09.1998) pertaining to the same property. This agreement did not provide for any details except that consideration for transfer of the property shall be mutually agreed between the parties at the time of registration of the sale deed, if the litigation is decided in favour of respondent No. 1. This MoU was followed by a registered agreement signed between the parties on 02.09.1998. It referred to an earlier MoU entered between the parties. Clause (4) of the agreement refers to the details of ₹10,00,000/- paid by the appellant to respondent No. 1. Besides other terms and conditions, which are not relevant for the decision of the controversy in issue, one of the clause in the agreement was that respondent No. 1 had assured the appellant that litigation pending in the High Court is likely to be decided shortly in his favour. However, in case it is not decided after one year from the date of execution of fi rst MoU on 15.04.1998, the appellant will have right to get the earnest money returned along with interest @ 18% per annum. Even the appellant had issued notice dated 22.03.2001 to respondent No. 1 for refund of earnest money. 13. A suit for injunction was fi led by the appellant against respondent No. 1 in January 2009. In the aforesaid civil suit, the appellant referred to the MoU entered into between the parties on 31.08.1998 (as registered on 01.09.1998). No reference was made to the subsequent agreement dated 02.09.1998. It was pleaded that the appellant (plaintiff therein) c a m e to know that respondent No. 1 was intending to sell the property to some other person as the prices of the property had increased manifold during the interregnum. It was pleaded that respondent No. 1 had not informed the appellant (plaintiff therein) about the fi nal result of the pending litigation and the appellant is still ready and willing to purchase the property at the rate which is mutually settled between the parties.
