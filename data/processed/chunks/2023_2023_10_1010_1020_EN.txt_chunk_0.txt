1010 SUP[R20E2M3]E 1C0O SU.CR.TR .R 1E0P1O0R :T 2S023 INSC [6200423] 10 S.C.R. A S. NARAHARI AND ORS. v. S.R. KUMAR AND ORS. (Civil Appeal No. 4289-4290 of 2023) B JULY 05, 2023 [KRISHNA MURARI AND SANJAY KAROL, JJ.] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or. XLVII r. 7 – Constitution Of India – Art. 141 – Whether liberty granted by Supreme Court to approach the High Court in review, automatically places the said C matter in the escalation matrix, and makes the remedy of Special Leave Petition available again – Held: It is necessary for the same to be adjudicated and deliberated upon by a larger bench of the Supreme Court. D Referring the matter to the larger Bench, the Court HELD: 1. If a dismissal of Special Leave Petition by way of a nonspeaking is not considered law under Article 141 of the Constitution of India, the same also cannot be considered as res judicata, and therefore, in every such dismissal, even in cases E where the dismissal is by way of a withdrawal, the remedy of filing a fresh Special Leave Petition would still persist. Further, if on the said reasoning, a remedy to file a review in the High Court is allowed, then the same reasoning cannot arbitrarily exclude the filing of a subsequent Special Leave Petition. [Para 39] [1019-F-G] F 2. This Court is aware of the fact that such an interpretation, if expanded beyond the specific scope of filing a review in the High Court is allowed, it would open the floodgates of litigation, and would essentially mean that every dismissal of Special Leave Petition must be accompanied with reasons declaring the same. G [Para 40][1020-A-B] 3. Therefore, to put a quietus to such an issue, it is necessary for the same to be adjudicated and deliberated upon by a larger bench of this Court. [Para 41][1020-C] H 1010 S.
