[Paras 28, 30.1, 30.2] Jogighopa (Assam) Unit of Ashok Paper Mills Limited (Acquisition Transfer of Undertaking) Act, 1990 – ss.22(6), (7) – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Applicability of the Codes: Held: s.22(6) of the Jogighopa Act makes suffi ciently clear the commissioner “for the purpose of making and investigation under this act” shall have the powers vested in “a civil court” under the Code to the limited extent as mentioned in (a), (b), (c), (d) – Not only u/s.22 (6) is the application of the code limited but further u/s.22 (7) – The application thereof is also equally well circumscribed therein, the Commissioner has been deemed to be a Civil Court for the purposes of s.195 and Chapter XXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – The description of the powers of either clearly testifi es to the intent of the state legislature to specifi cally restrict the application of both the said Codes, to only the extent provided – The principle of statutory interpretation: expression unius est exclusion alterius (the expression of one thing is the exclusion of the other) supports such a view – Therefore, it is clear that the vesting of select few powers upon a Tribunal, or as in the present case, a statutory authority, does not equate the same to be a Court within the meaning of the Code – Further, s.22(6) stating M/S NORTH EASTERN CHEMICALS INDUSTRIES (P) LTD. 823 v. M/S ASHOK PAPER MILL (ASSAM) LTD. “the Commissioner shall have the power to regulation his own procedure in all matters arising out of the discharge of his functions including the place or places at which he will hold his sittings” also supports the proposition that the Code does not apply to the proceedings of the Commissioner.

[Para 21] Limitation – No express limitation provided in regard to the exercise of a right to assail the – Duty of Court: Held: When a Court is seized of a situation where no limitation stands provided either by specifi c applicability of the Limitation Act or the special statute governing the dispute, the Court must undertake a holistic assessment of the facts and circumstances of the case to examine the possibility of delay causing prejudice to a party – When no limitation stands prescribed, it would be inappropriate for a Court to supplant the legislature’s wisdom by its own and provide a limitation, more so in accordance with what it believes to be the appropriate period – A court should, in such a situation consider in the facts and circumstances of the case at hand, the conduct of the parties, the nature of the proceeding, the length of delay, the possibility of prejudice being caused, and the scheme of the statute in question – Also, when a party to a dispute raises a plea of delay despite no specifi c period being prescribed in the statute, such a party also bears the burden of demonstrating how the delay in itself would cause the party additional prejudice or loss as opposed to, the claim subject matter of dispute, being raised at an earlier point in time – However, when a statute, either general or specifi c in application, provides for a limitation within which to fi le an appeal, the parties interested in doing so are put to notice of the requirement to act with expedition – Opposite thereto, in cases such as the present one where neither statute provides for an explicit limitation, such urgency may be absent – Although, this does 824 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R.
