The relevant observations read as under: - [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1713 Celir LLP v. Mr. Sumati Prasad Bafna & Ors. “9. Section 19 of the Specific Relief Act clearly says subsequent sale can be enforced for good and sufficient reason but in the present case, there is no difficulty because the suit was filed on 3-5-1975 for specific performance of the agreement and the second sale took place on 5-5-1975. Therefore, it is the admitted position that the second sale was definitely after the filing of the suit in question. Had that not been the position then we would have evaluated the effect of Section 19 of the Specific Relief Act read with Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act. But in the present case it is more than apparent that the suit was filed before the second sale of the property. Therefore, the principle of lis pendens will govern the present case and the second sale cannot have the overriding effect on the first sale. xxx xxx xxx 15. So far as the present case is concerned, it is apparent that the appellant who is a subsequent purchaser of the same property, has purchased in good faith but the principle of lis pendens will certainly be applicable to the present case notwithstanding the fact that under Section 19(b) of the Specific Relief Act his rights could be protected.” (Emphasis supplied) 165. Similarly in a recent decision of this Court in Chander Bhan (D) through Lr. Sher Singh v. Mukhtiar Singh & Ors. reported in 2024 INSC 377 it was held that once the transaction in question is found to be illegal due to the doctrine of lis pendens, any defence of the subsequent transferee that they are a bona-fide purchaser is liable to be rejected. The relevant observations read as under: - “21. Once it has been held that the transactions executed by the respondents are illegal due to the doctrine of lis pendens the defence of the respondents 1-2 that they are bonafide purchasers for valuable consideration and thus, entitled to protection under Section 41 of the Act of 1882 is liable to be rejected.” (Emphasis supplied) 1714 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 166. Thus, the question to be examined is whether the transfer of the secured asset in favour of the Subsequent Transferee is hit by lis pendens or not. It is an undisputed fact that on 25.08.2023 Special Leave Petition Nos. 19523-19524 of 2023 (later renumbered as Civil Appeal Nos. 5542-5543 of 2023) came to be filed by the petitioner challenging the impugned dated 17.08.2023 passed by the High Court permitting the Borrower herein to redeem the mortgage created over the Secured Asset. It is also not in dispute that on 28.08.2023 the Borrower pursuant to the aforesaid of the High Court redeemed the mortgage and transferred the said property to the Subsequent Transferee herein on the very same day by executing the aforesaid Assignment Agreement. It is also undisputed that the transfer of the Secured Asset in favour of the Subsequent Transferee was effected by the Borrower on the strength of its right of redemption pursuant to the High Court’s impugned dated 17.08.2023.
