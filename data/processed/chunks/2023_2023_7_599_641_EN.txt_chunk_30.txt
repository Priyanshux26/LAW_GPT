C 15. In Mustiu and Boyd’s Commercial Arbitration (1982 Edn.) under the heading “Hopeless Claim” in Chapter 31 at page 436 it is stated thus: “There is undoubtedly no jurisdiction to interfere by way of injunction to prevent the respondent from being harassed D by a claim which can never lead to valid award for example in cases where claim is brought in respect of the alleged Arbitration agreement which does not really exist or which has ceased to exist. So also where the dispute lies outside the scope of arbitration agreement.”” E (Emphasis supplied) 66. The case on hand is clearly and undoubtedly, one of a hopelessly barred claim, as the petitioner by its conduct slept over its right for more than five years. Statutory arbitrations stand apart. 67. In view of the aforesaid, this petition fails and is hereby rejected. F 68. Pending application(s) if any shall stand disposed of. Divya Pandey Petition rejected.
