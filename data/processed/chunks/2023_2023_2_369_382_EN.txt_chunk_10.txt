Once, she was relieved from NTRO and she had reported for duty as Scientist – G in DRDO as observed hereinabove, thereafter she cannot be permitted to claim that she had continued working as Scientist – H in NTRO. 6.4 Even otherwise, it is required to be noted that the respondent was appointed as Scientist – H in NTRO as a direct recruit, on probation G and her probation period was not completed. Before her probation period was completed/over, she was relieved. Therefore, even as per the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, she could not have been given the pensionary benefits / terminal benefits as Scientist -H in NTRO. H 382 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A 7. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned and passed by the High Court is unsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside and the and passed by the CAT is restored. However, to do complete justice, we direct that if the original writ petitioner – respondent herein so wishes, she may press the prayer B to accept her VRS application, which may be considered by the DRDO. If she presses her VRS application to voluntary retire her, the same may be considered positively. However, the same shall be done by the DRDO on the post of Scientist – G so that the respondent can get all other benefits, which may be available to her on accepting her voluntary C retirement application, as otherwise also, she continued to have a lien on the post of Scientist – G in DRDO, as has been observed hereinabove. With this, the present appeal is allowed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no as to costs. D Divya Pandey Appeal allowed.
