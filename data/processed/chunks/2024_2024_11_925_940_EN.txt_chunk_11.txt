This decision was found to be manifestly arbitrary by this Court and therefore, the appeal was allowed. However, in the present case, the decision to cancel the auction was not unfounded, it was undertaken to remedy the erroneous minimum rate provided in the NIT dated 07.07.2020, as noted in the report of the Div. Commissioner of the IDA. Therefore, the Appellants were well within their rights to cancel the auction. More importantly, in the present case, pursuant to the cancellation of the first NIT, a second NIT was issued wherein the respondent No. 1 did not participate. Despite this fact, the Division Bench of the High Court effectively usurped the powers of the auctioning authority and fixed the price at Rs. 26,000/- per square meter. Hence, being entirely distinguishable on facts, the reliance placed is of no assistance to respondent No. 1. 16. Resultantly, the IDA is directed to issue a fresh NIT for disposal of the land in question enabling the IDA to generate more revenues in respect of the land in question. The appellant shall certainly be free to participate in the fresh NIT as and when issued by the IDA. It is made clear that the IDA shall not dispose of the land in question except by way of public auction/by issuing NIT in future. 17. With the aforesaid, the appeal stands allowed. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Adeeba Mujahid, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Abhinav Mukerji, Sr. Adv.)
