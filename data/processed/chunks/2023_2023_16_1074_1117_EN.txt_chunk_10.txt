The eff ect of the Amending Act of 2002 was that Limboo and Tamang communities stood included in the list of Scheduled Tribes for the States of West Bengal and Sikkim with eff ect from 7 January 2003. 22. Upon the completion of the delimitation exercise, on 26 November 2008, the Delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies 2008 was issued by the Election Commission. The Delimitation 6 Amending Act of 2002. PUBLIC INTEREST COMMITTEE FOR SCHEDULING SPECIFIC 1089 AREAS v. UOI [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] stipulated the seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes in the state legislative assemblies as well as the seats reserved in the House of the People, out of the total seats allocated to states.

Though a demand was made by certain castes and tribes designated as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for reservation in the House of the People and State Legislative Assemblies by taking into account the additional population as a result of the Amending Act of 2002, the exercise was never actually carried out. 24. In carrying out the delimitation exercise under Section 9 of the Delimitation Act, Section 9(2) provides that the Commission shall publish the delimitation proposals, specify the date after which the proposals shall be considered by it and consider the objections received before fi nally determining the delimitation of constituencies. Accordingly, in 2005, the Delimitation proposal for Assembly constituencies for the State of Sikkim was published. The number of seats to be reserved for Scheduled Tribes was to be determined on the basis of the 2001 census and the proposal did not contain seats reserved for the Scheduled Tribes of Sikkim. It was stated that unlike clauses 3A and 3B of Article 332, which enables the Delimitation Commission to deviate from the “generalized procedure as contained in the Delimitation Act, 2002 read with Delimitation (Amendment) Act 2003” for certain states, there is no provision which allows a similar deviation from the generic provisions of the Delimitation Act in to accommodate the newly inducted Scheduled Tribes. Various representations were made to the Delimitation Commission on the ground that the 2001 census alone did not 7 Out of the 13 seats, 12 were reserved for Sikkimese of Bhutia-Lepcha Origin and 1 for the Sanghas. 109 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. account for the then newly designated Limboo-Tamang Scheduled Tribes for reservations in the constituencies. 25. However, despite the objections, the 2006 Delimitation Notifi cation was published without accounting for the Scheduled Tribes designated as such under the Amending Act of 2002. The 2006 Notifi cation formed the basis of the 2008 issued by the Election Commission under RP Act 1950.
