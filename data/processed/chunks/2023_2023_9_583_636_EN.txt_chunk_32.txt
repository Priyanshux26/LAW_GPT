24. It was sought to be submitted by learned counsel for the appellants that there was no specific date mentioned in the advertisement B dated 22.07.2021 as to the validity period of the certificates to be furnished by the appellants, and subsequent notice dated 04.08.2022 directing the appellants to produce the certificates as mentioned therein was highly unreasonable, and tantamount to changing the rules of game after the process of selection had started. The Court does not find any substance C in the said argument. As stated earlier, there were specific instructions given in the advertisement that the candidates applying under the reserved categories had to submit the valid certificates issued by the competent authority, and therefore such certificates had to be in consonance with the circulars of the State Government dated 09.09.2015 and 08.08.2019 which governed the validity period of such certificates. The subsequent D notice dated 04.08.2022 given by the respondent-High Court requiring the candidates belonging to OBC/MBC(NCL) to produce the certificates issued not prior to one year from the last date fixed for the submission of application form i.e., 31.08.2021, was absolutely in consonance with the said circulars issued by the State Government. It was also mentioned in E the said notice dated 04.08.2022 that in case the OBC/MBC(NCL) certificate was issued between 31.08.2018 and 30.08.2020, an affidavit in prescribed format along with the caste certificate had to be produced. For the EWS category, it was stated that the Income and Asset certificate required for seeking reservation in EWS category must not have been issued prior to 01.04.2021 and in case the Income and Asset certificate F was issued between 01.04.2019 and 31.03.2021, then an affidavit in the prescribed format along with the certificate had to be produced. It was specifically mentioned therein that SC/ST/OBC/MBC/EWS certificate, as the case may be, must not have been issued after the last date of submission of the application form i.e., 31.08.2021. Such instructions G requiring the reserved category candidates to produce the requisite certificates could neither be said to be unreasonable nor could be construed as changing the rules of game after selection process was started, they being in consonance with the important instructions given in the advertisement dated 22.07.2021, and in consonance with the H 632 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A circulars issued by the State Government with regard to the validity period of caste certificates. 25. It is needless to say that when a candidate applies under a particular reserved category, he or she is required to have the certificate of that particular category on the date on which he or she makes the B application to show his or her eligibility to apply under the said category. If such certificates are obtained subsequent to date of their application or subsequent to the last date of submission of the applications mentioned in the advertisement, such certificates could not be said to be valid certificates, more particularly in cases where the candidate applies under OBC-NCL or EWS, which category is highly dynamic and not static, as C the economic status of the candidate would keep on changing depending on the income of the candidate.
