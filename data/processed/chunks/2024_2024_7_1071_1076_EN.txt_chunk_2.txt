After remand, the District Munsif Court, by a detailed reasoned dated 15.04.2016, again granted leave under II Rule 2(3) CPC to the respondent to file a separate suit against the appellant. Aggrieved, the appellant challenged the same before the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution, which was registered as CRP (PD) No.1872 of 2016. 7. In the meantime, the respondent filed a Commercial Suit No.323 of 2016 before the Madras High Court against the appellant for recovery of arrears of storage charges, warehouse charges and damages for an amount of Rs.8,42,88,761/-. In the said C.S. No.323 of 2016, the appellant filed an application being IA No.3666 of 2016 under VII Rule 11(d) read with II Rule 2 of CPC for rejection of the said claim. This application was filed on 21st July, 2016. 8. The civil revision as also the application under VII Rule 11 CPC were heard together by the High Court and vide and dated 24.11.2016, the High Court dismissed both the civil revision as also the application. Aggrieved by the same, the present appeal has been filed. 9. In the meantime, the appellant vacated the warehouse and handed over the keys to the respondent on 30th September, 2016. Accordingly, the respondent on 11.04.2017 withdrew its O.S. No.101 of 2015 as possession had already been delivered to it. 10. Further, the appellant filed another Commercial Suit No.160 of 2017 before the Madras High Court claiming refund of security deposit, additional deposit, penalty paid to the University Board, cost of improvements and damages amounting to Rs.5,77,03,621/- against the respondent. 11. From the above, it is noticeable that both the sides preferred two suits each, however, one of the suits i.e. Suit No.101 of 2015 has already been withdrawn by the respondent and, as such, three suits remain pending which are all commercial suits pending before the Madras High Court inter se parties. 12. It would be worthwhile to mention here before proceeding any further that the Trial Court as also the High Court had found that both the [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1075 Uniworld Logistics Pvt. Ltd. v. Indev Logistics Pvt. Ltd. suits were filed based upon different causes of action. The High Court had further found that the respondent had taken leave for instituting the second suit against the appellant under II Rule 2(3) CPC. It also found that the respondent had specifically stated in the plaint of the first suit that there were claims for damages and warehouse charges to be recovered for which, it reserved its claim for recovery of the same. At no stage had the respondent given up its claim, nor was there any omission to claim the relief of recovery. It was neither a case of relinquishment of claim or omission. The High Court has dealt with in great detail the object of II Rule 2(3) CPC. It has also discussed the law on the point. It had thereafter arrived at the conclusion that neither there was infirmity in the of the Trial Court granting leave to file the second suit for recovery of arrears, nor was there any merit in the application under VII Rule 11 CPC filed by the appellant.
