28. As already discussed hereinabove, the provisions under XXVI Rule 6 of the SC Rules are analogous to VII Rule 11 (a) and (d) of the CPC. We will have to therefore consider the preliminary objections as raised by the defendant in the light of the aforesaid legal provisions. 29. As already observed hereinabove, the word ‘shall’ casts a duty upon the court to consider as to whether the plaint is hit by any of the infirmities mentioned in the provision even without the intervention of the defendant. As such, we do not find any force in the submission of the plaintiff that the objections could not be considered in the 14 [2002] Supp. 5 SCR 491 : (2003) 1 SCC 557 : 2002 INSC 554 15 [2004] 1 SCR 1004 : (2004) 3 SCC 137 : 2004 INSC 56 16 [2012] 6 SCR 1018 : (2012) 8 SCC 701 : 2012 INSC 293 17 [2018] 3 SCR 422 : (2018) 6 SCC 422 : 2018 INSC 319 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 691 The State of West Bengal v. Union of India absence of an application for the rejection of plaint filed by the defendant under XXVI Rule 6 of the SC Rules. b. Article 131 of the Constitution: 30. It will be apposite to refer to Article 131 of the Constitution, which reads thus: “131. Original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.- Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the Supreme Court shall, to the exclusion of any other court, have original jurisdiction in any dispute- (a) between the Government of India and one or more States; or (b) between the Government of India and any State or States on one side and one or more other States on the other; or (c) between two or more States, if and in so far as the dispute involves any question (whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends: Provided that the said jurisdiction shall not extend to a dispute arising out of any treaty, agreement, covenant, engagement, sanad or other similar instrument which, having been entered into or executed before the commencement of this Constitution, continues in operation after such commencement, or which provides that the said jurisdiction shall not extend to such a dispute.” 31. It is thus clear that the jurisdiction of this Court, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, is to the exclusion of any other court. The jurisdiction has to be exercised for any dispute either between the Government of India and one or more States; or between the Government of India and any State or States on one side and one or more other States on the other; or between two or more States. The jurisdiction is also limited insofar as the dispute involves any question (whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of legal right depends. 692 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
