The dated 20.10.1967 held that the University was not established by the minority community and therefore, it cannot be said to be an institution falling under the expanse of Article 30 of the Constitution. 96. In 1981, Writ Petition No.54-51 of 1981 came up before a bench of two Hon’ble Judges of this Court, which was titled Anjuman-e- Rehmania & Ors v. Distt. Inspector of School & Ors. In the said petition, this Court was confronted with a question, which is recorded in its dated 26.11.1981. The relevant portion is reproduced hereunder: - “The point that arises is as to whether Act. 30(1) of the Constitution envisages an institution which is established by minorities alone without the participation for the factum of establishment from any other community. On this point, there is no clear decision of this court. There are some observations in S. Azeez Basha & ors. Vs. Union of India 1968(1) SCR 333, but these observations can be explained away. Another point that arises is whether soon after the establishment of the institution if it is registered as a Society under the Society Registration Act, its status as a minority institution changes in view of the broad principles laid down in S. Azeez Basha’s case. Even as it is several jurists including Mr. Seervai have expressed about the correctness of the decision of this court in S. Azeez Basha’s case.
