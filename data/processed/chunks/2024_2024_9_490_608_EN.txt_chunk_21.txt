(vi) In paragraph 13 of the impugned , the Division Bench sought to appreciate the evidence i.e. the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018, which was beyond the scope of powers exercisable under Section 37 read with Section 34 of the 1996 Act. In this regard, reliance was placed on: (i) UHL Power Company limited v. State of Himachal Pradesh;9 (ii) Dyna Technologies Pvt. Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Lt.;10 (iii) Heidelbergh Cement India Ltd. v. The Indure Pvt. Ltd.;11 (iv) MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd.;12 (v) Ssangyong Engg (supra); and (vi) Haryana Tourism Ltd. v. Kandhari Beverages Ltd.13 (vii) The learned Single Judge justifiably set aside the award that was self-contradictory and perverse. (viii) Counterclaims for cost of repair/ replacement of gear boxes, which were defective, ought to have been adjudicated. In absence thereof, the arbitral award is rendered bad in law. (ix) The Division Bench of the High Court misconstrued the ratio of the decision of this Court in Geo Miller & Co. (P) Ltd. v. Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd14 for treating the claim within, and the counterclaim beyond, the period of limitation. (x) The subsequent purchase s issued by OPG replaced the earlier purchase s issued by Gita Power, and the supply/ 9 [2022] 1 SCR 1 : (2022) 4 SCC 116, paragraphs 16 to 21 10 [2019] 15 SCR 295 : (2019) 20 SCC 1, paragraphs 27-43 11 2022/DHC/003952 12 [2019] 3 SCR 1023 : (2019) 4 SCC 163, paragraphs 11 to 13 13 [2022] 2 SCR 316 : (2022) 3 SCC 237, paragraphs 7 & 8 14 [2019] 11 SCR 1108 : (2020) 14 SCC 643 (para 28) [2024] 9 S.C.R. 521 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. work was in respect of an OPG project, therefore Gita Power could not have been dragged into arbitration and made jointly and severally liable with OPG. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF FIRST RESPONDENT/ENEXIO 26. The learned counsel for the first respondent, inter alia, submitted: (i) The findings in the award are factually correct. There is no patent illegality, as alleged, or otherwise, which may warrant interference under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. Therefore, the Division Bench of the High Court was justified in setting aside the of the Single Judge and restoring the award. (ii) The appellant’s case that all counterclaims were treated as barred by limitation and, therefore, not considered on merits, is factually incorrect. In all five counterclaims were there. Out of those five, counterclaims towards: (i) liquidated damages for the delay in supply and erection; (ii) customs duty; and (iii) cost of erection of horizontal and vertical exhaust duct through an external agency, were considered and decided on merits. The counterclaims for liquidated damages and customs duty were rejected whereas counterclaim for cost of erection of vertical duct was allowed. Only two counterclaims towards (i) cost of repair/ replacement of Gear Boxes, due to alleged defective supply, amounting to Rs.9,76,000, and (ii) cost of repair/ replacement of Fan Modules, due to alleged defective supply, amounting to Rs.14,80,802, were dismissed as barred by limitation.
