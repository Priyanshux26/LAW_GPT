[Paras 22-25] Service Law – Disciplinary proceedings – Scope of judicial review: Held: Scope of judicial review against a departmental enquiry proceeding is very limited – It is not in the nature of an appeal and a review on merits of the decision is not permissible – Scope of the enquiry is to examine whether the decision-making process is legitimate and to ensure that the fi ndings are not bereft of any evidence – If the records reveal that the fi ndings are based on some evidence, it is not the function of the court in a judicial review to re-appreciate the same and arrive at an independent fi nding on the evidence – On facts, it could not be said that the Enquiry Report, the fi ndings of the Disciplinary Authority and the of the Appointing Authority are based on no evidence or are perverse – Even if the report insofar as the aspect of non-submission of control form, the transgression of the area of operation and non-declaration of the immovable property and certain other charges is avoided, the of penalty can be sustained – Aspects of failure to conduct periodic inspection and the negligence in not stipulating the taking of immovable property as collateral security in spite of the party off ering it, constrains to conclude that there was material on record for the appellant to pass the of penalty – s of the Single 654 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. Judge and the Division Bench not sustainable for transgressing the limits of judicial review in setting aside the enquiry proceedings and the punishment imposed. [Paras 32, 33, 36 and 37] Service Law – Penalty – Severability of charges – Interference with the of penalty: Held: If in a disciplinary proceeding, the of penalty can be imposed on the charges proved and the punishment imposed is lawfully sustainable on those charges, it is not for the Court to consider whether those grounds alone would have weighed with the authority in imposing the punishment – Unless punishment imposed is only co-relatable to any of those charges found not proved, the penalty cannot be set aside – On facts, the punishment can be sustained even if the charges held not proved are severed – Test is not of loss having being resulted or profi t having been made, the test is whether the delinquent employee, has observed the prescribed norms of the Bank – Penalty imposed is “reduction in basic pay to the lowest stage in Scale-I” and further, to treat the period spent by the delinquent offi cer as under suspension – Since the charge of not conducting periodical inspection and the failure to complete the formalities for creating equitable mortgage are supported by evidence, the penalty as imposed is not disproportionate so as to shock the conscience of the Court – Penalty as imposed by the Appointing Authority and as confi rmed by the Appellate Authority maintained.
