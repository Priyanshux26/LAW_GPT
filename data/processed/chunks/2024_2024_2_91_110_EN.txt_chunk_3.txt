However, the request for interest made by the respondent was rejected by the DGFT. 3. Aggrieved by rejection of the request for interest on the amount of duty drawback paid, respondent preferred a writ petition before the High Court which was registered as Writ Petition No.45525 of 2004. After hearing the parties, a learned Single Judge of the High Court vide the and dated 22.09.2005 referred to the notification dated 05.12.2000 and held that respondent was entitled for duty drawback. After observing that there was delay in payment of duty drawback, learned Single Judge held that respondent would be entitled to interest for delayed payment of duty drawback. Since Customs Act, 1962 provides that interest has to be paid in such a case in the range of five percent to thirty percent, learned Single Judge awarded interest at the rate of fifteen percent. Consequently, directions were issued to the appellants to consider the claim of the respondent for payment of interest on delayed refund from the date of notification dated 05.12.2000 till the date of payment to the respondent within a period of three months. 96 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 4. This and of the learned Single Judge came to be assailed by the appellants before the Division Bench of the High Court which was registered as Writ Appeal No.356 of 2006. Respondent also filed Writ Appeal No.3699 of 2005 assailing the direction of the learned Single Judge to pay interest only from 05.12.2000. The Division Bench took note of the fact that since duty drawback was refunded by the appellants to the respondent, the only question to be considered was the entitlement of the respondent to interest for the delayed refund. In this connection, the Division Bench examined the notification dated 20.08.1998 and observed that this notification had clarified that ‘deemed export’ would include goods and services of civil construction projects. Thus, duty drawback under the Exim Policy in force was extended even to civil construction. This position was further clarified by the subsequent notification dated 05.12.2000. Such notification was held by the Division Bench to be clarificatory in nature, thus having retrospective effect. After referring to Sections 27A and 75A of the Customs Act, 1962, the Division Bench held that respondent would be entitled to interest after expiry of three months from the date of making the applications for refund of duty drawback. Vide the and dated 22.08.2008, the Division Bench opined that respondent would be entitled to interest from the date of expiry of three months after submitting the applications for refund of duty drawback in the year 1996 at the rate of fifteen percent as awarded by the learned Single Judge. While the writ appeal of the respondent was allowed, the writ appeal of the appellants was dismissed. 5. Mr. V. C. Bharathi, learned counsel for the appellants submitted a short list of dates and events. He pointed out therefrom that applications filed by the respondent for duty drawback were repeatedly rejected by the DGFT.
