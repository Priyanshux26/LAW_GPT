Understood G in its ordinary meaning it is of wide import and is not confined to loss of tax. The High Court of Calcutta in Dawjee Dadabhoy & Co. v. S.P. Jain [(1957) 31 ITR 872 (Cal)] , the High Court of Karnataka in CIT v. T. Narayana Pai [(1975) 98 ITR 422 (Kant)], the High Court of Bombay in CIT v. Gabriel India Ltd. [(1993) 203 ITR 108 (Bom)] and the High Court of Gujarat in CIT v. H COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX 7 v. M/S PAVILLE 319 PROJECTS PVT. LTD. [M. R. SHAH, J.] Minalben S. Parikh [(1995) 215 ITR 81 (Guj)] treated loss of A tax as prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. 9. Mr Abraham relied on the of the Division Bench of the High Court of Madras in Venkatakrishna Rice Co. v. CIT [(1987) 163 ITR 129 (Mad)] interpreting “prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue”. The High Court held: B “In this context, (it must) be regarded as involving a conception of acts or s which are subversive of the administration of revenue. There must be some grievous error in the passed by the Income Tax Officer, which might set a bad trend or pattern for similar assessments, which on a broad reckoning, the C Commissioner might think to be prejudicial to the interests of Revenue Administration.” In our view this interpretation is too narrow to merit acceptance. The scheme of the Act is to levy and collect tax in accordance with the provisions of the Act and this task is entrusted to the D Revenue. If due to an erroneous of the Income Tax Officer, the Revenue is losing tax lawfully payable by a person, it will certainly be prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. 10. The phrase “prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue” has to be read in conjunction with an erroneous passed by E the Assessing Officer. Every loss of revenue as a consequence of an of the Assessing Officer cannot be treated as prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, for example, when an Income Tax Officer adopted one of the courses permissible in law and it has resulted in loss of revenue; or where two views are possible and the Income Tax Officer has taken one view with which the F Commissioner does not agree, it cannot be treated as an erroneous prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue unless the view taken by the Income Tax Officer is unsustainable in law. It has been held by this Court that where a sum not earned by a person is assessed as income in his hands on his so offering, the G passed by the Assessing Officer accepting the same as such will be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue.
