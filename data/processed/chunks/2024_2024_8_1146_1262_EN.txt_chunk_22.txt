Digital Supreme Court Reports 3.8 AUDIT OBJECTIONS RAISED BY THE COMPTROLLER AND AUDITOR GENERAL32 3.8.1 On 31st October, 2013, the Office of the Principal Accountant General (E&RSA), Karnataka raised an audit inquiry on KPCL on the subject of non-utilization of the washery rejects and the resultant undue benefit of ₹ 53.37 crores to a private company. The audit inquiry noted that KECML had engaged a third party agency namely, GCWL through a MoU for washing of coal and Clause 12 of the MoU stipulated that rejects should be the joint property of KECML and GCWL which ought to be disposed of/sold jointly at mutually agreed terms subject to compliance of the relevant rules, regulations/ guidelines issued by the MoC, if applicable. It was stated that KECML had executed the MoU with GCWL to dispose off the rejects without the concurrence of KPCL and KPCL did not demand the washery rejects from KECML either for its captive consumption or for its disposal. Further, it was stated that no coal could be sold/delivered/disposed of except for captive mining purpose, i.e., power generation and with the previous written approval of the Central Government. 3.8.2 The observations made by the CAG in Audit Inquiry No. 18 are extracted below: “We observed that ¾ Depending on the type of coal being washed and the requirement of the captive user, the rejects and middlings are generated from washery. A study report indicates that washing of D-grade coal generates rejects and middling of F and G-grade, and such low quality coal was also being used in power generation. ¾ The purpose of allocation of coal blocks for captive use under section 3(3) of the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973 is not to enable free trading of coal by private 32 For short “CAG” [2024] 8 S.C.R.
