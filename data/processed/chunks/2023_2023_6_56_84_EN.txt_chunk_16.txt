The first of these time zones commenced with the letter dated 14.07.1994 and ended with the handing over of possession of the land by appellant No.1 on 09.12.1995 to the Corporation and the Corporation issuing a DRC on 02.01.1996 E granting TDR for the surrendered land. The second time zone commenced on 20.11.1996 with Mayfair Housing seeking permission of the Corporation to develop and maintain the Recreation Ground and ended up with the request for additional TDR dated 17.04.1998 being rejected by dated 27.11.1998. 40. Once the entire correspondence between the appellants and F the respondents, is split into two time zones, an interesting picture emerges therefrom. This can be summarised as follows:- (i) What was applied for in Form No.2625 enclosed to the letter of the Architects dated 14.11.1994, was only a DRC for the surrender of the land. There was no indication in the said letter dated 14.07.1994 G that appellant No.1 was interested in developing an amenity for the purpose of claiming Additional TDR. This is why, the answer of appellant No.1 to the question at Serial No. 17 of the printed Form for the grant of DRC assumes significance. The question at Serial No.17 and the answer thereto are extracted as follows:- H 80 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A (17) Whether the reservation is : Does not arise as the proposed to be built upon as per the reservation is for R.G. plans approved by the concerned Authority as per sub regulation No.6 of Appendix-VII, if so, details thereof. B (ii) The above answer to question No.17, in Form No.2625 submitted by appellant No.1 themselves along with their letter dated 14.07.1994, stands in stark contrast, to the answer to the very same question in the Form submitted by appellant No.2 along with the letter dated 17.04.1998. Question No. 17 and the answer thereto in the Form submitted by appellant No.2 along with the letter dated 17.04.1998 read C as follows: D (iii) Therefore, it is clear that it is only after appellant No.2, a builder, entered into the scene that the claim for additional TDR cropped up. As we have stated earlier, appellant No.2 entered the scene only in November 1996, first sought permission to develop and then got a Power E of Attorney executed in his favour on 24.12.1996. Till the entry of appellant No.2, it was only ‘Worthy Architects’ who were representing the appellant No.1. This can be seen from other documents also. (iv) For instance, in the letter dated 08.10.1994, Worthy Enterprises sought permission to develop the Recreation Ground reservation by F suitably cutting, levelling, filling and terracing etc. But there is no whisper in the said letter about additional TDR; (v) However, an endorsement is made in the internal department note dated 03.12.1994 asking the officer concerned to “inform the developer that he can develop the RG by availing ATDR.” But it G must be remembered at this stage that the claim of appellant No.1 for TDR by surrendering the land itself was pending consideration and the offer for levelling, cutting etc., seem to have been made for the purpose of convincing the Corporation to accept the surrender of land and to grant TDR.
