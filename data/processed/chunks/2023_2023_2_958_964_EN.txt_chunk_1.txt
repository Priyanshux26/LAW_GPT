As per Office Report dated 14.12.2011 in terms of the affidavit filed by the appellant, the service on the respondent was complete but he had not put in appearance till date. Meaning thereby that he is not interested to E defend the present litigation. 3. A perusal of the award of the Labour Court shows that the address of the respondent is through some Union and he had not furnished his own address. A perusal of the passed by the Single Bench of High Court shows that the respondent workman was represented, hence he knew about the challenge to the award of the Labour Court and also F dismissal of the Writ Petition. 4. The dated 07.11.2006 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court in the appeal filed by the Management against the passed by the Single Bench shows that the statement of the counsel for the Management was recorded that the Management will reinstate the G workman and he shall be communicated accordingly so as to enable him to report for duty. Challenge was to the award of the Labour Court only to the extent of award of back-wages. The appeal was admitted. Thereafter, the Management had sent various communications by Registered Post/Courier on 08.11.2006, 10.11.2006 and 24.11.2006 H 960 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A requesting the respondent to report for duty. However, there was no response. 5. Further, when the matter was taken up by the Division Bench of the High Court on 30.10.2007, the statement of counsel for the workman was recorded that he will report for duty on 05.11.2007 at B 10:00 A.M. The reads as under: “1. The learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent No.1 states that the Respondent No.1 will report for work at Amir Industrial Estate, Sun Mill Compound, Lower Parel, Mumbai. The learned Counsel for the appellant states that if C the respondent No.1 comes to Amir Industrial Estate, Sun Mill Compound, Lower Parel, Mumbai, at 10.00 a.m. on 5.11.2007 and meet Mr. S.K. Kedia, he will be permitted to join immediately. The statements are accepted. Put up on 19.11.2007.” 6. The Management sent another letter to the workman on D 26.12.2007 specifically mentioning that his inaction to report for duty would amount to presumption that he is no more interested to join the duty. Request was also made to him to furnish his permanent address. 7. When the matter was taken up for hearing, the learned counsel for the appellant on instructions from his client submitted that the E respondent has not reported for duty till date. Meaning thereby that he is no more interested in joining duty and must have been gainfully employed after leaving the job in question. 8. Considering the aforesaid factual matrix, in our opinion the award of the Labour Court granting back-wages and continuity in service to F the respondent workman deserves to be set aside as he has not reported for duty despite the statement made by his counsel in Court on 30.10.2007.
