Initially, the Deputy Collector passed s on 05.11.2020 observing that the eviction proceedings can be taken forward only after directions from the High Court and in the meanwhile directed the appellant to deposit 11 months rent concerning 30 non-cooperating slum dwellers. These applications under Sections 33 and 38 of the Act came to be decided only in 2021, and that is how, it is submitted, the project got delayed for reasons beyond the control of the appellant. 18.1. Mr. Ahmadi submitted that the pendency of the eviction applications does not justify the extraordinary delay of 5 years on the part of the appellant. Mr. Sundaram submitted that the mere filing of applications under Sections 33 and 38 of the Act is not sufficient to justify the delay. It is submitted that the appellant has failed to take active steps in getting the applications disposed of. This inaction suited the appellant as it did not have the capacity or the capability to complete the project. 18.2. Affirming the findings of the AGRC, the High Court observed that the appellant went into deep slumber after filing applications for eviction of non-cooperating slum dwellers between 2014-2015. 18.3. The fact that the appellant had to initiate proceedings against certain non-cooperating members and that the proceedings were pending for a long time, whether justified or not, should not have a bearing on the obligations of the appellant to complete and handover the project as per the development agreement. Under no circumstance, litigation of this nature would justify inaction from 2014 to 2019. 19. (iv) The next period of inaction is from 2015 to 2017. This is sought to be justified on the ground that the Municipal Corporation sanctioned 1462 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports a road that may pass through the property and published the draft development plan (DP) on 25.02.2015. 19.1. The objections filed by the appellant on 03.04.2015 eventually came to be disposed of only on 12.11.2018 when the said road was deleted from the development plan. This period, Mr. Sibal submits, must be excluded as no development, much less any construction, is permissible once the draft plan is published. 19.2. Mr. Sundaram submitted that if the appellant had commenced the construction after the commencement certificate dated 14.07.2014, the draft development plan published in 2015 could never have affected the re-development at all. He further submitted that as LOI and IOA were issued in 2011 and 2012, the so-called draft DP published in 2015 cannot be a justification. Mr. Ahmadi has submitted that except for 2 months between 25.02.2015 and 23.04.2015, there was no proposed development plan road in any of the plans. He would submit that the proposed DP road affected only the proposed sale building, not the entire project. In any event, he would submit that the sale building could not have commenced till substantial progress in rehabilitation building was made. 19.3. The observations of AGRC also go to show that draft DP could justify 2 years’ delay and no more.
