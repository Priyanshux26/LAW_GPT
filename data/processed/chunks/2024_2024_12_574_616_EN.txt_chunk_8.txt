12. The learned counsel submitted that the High Court has committed an error by holding that the quantum of delay is not material. He submitted that the delay has to be inordinate and, therefore, the quantum of delay is very material. He submitted that the time consumed for the disposal of mercy petitions by the Hon’ble Governor and the Hon’ble President of India was from 10th July 2015 to 26th May 2017, which is about one year and ten months. His submission is that this delay cannot be held to be inordinate or unexplained. He submitted that, in any case, there is an explanation for the delay. He submitted that there was some delay as time was required to ascertain whether the convicts wanted to file review petitions. He submitted that the time taken of a few months to prepare a note for presenting it to the Hon’ble Governor could not be said to be unreasonable as it required scanning of voluminous records. Even the time of three months taken by the Hon’ble Governor cannot be said to be unreasonable. 13. As regards the delay in the disposal of mercy petitions by the Hon’ble President of India, he submitted that the time of five months was consumed in getting information on the criminal antecedents and economic condition of the convicts. Time of about four months or more was required to get the information on the issue of convicts filing review petitions before this Court. The Hon’ble President of India took about four months to decide on the mercy petitions, which is not at all long or inordinate considering the fact that the issue was the 5 [2014] 12 SCR 441 : (2015) 2 SCC 478 6 [2020] 1 SCR 761 : (2020) 16 SCC 424 7 [2022] 8 SCR 628 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1528 586 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports life and death of the convicts. He submitted that in the case of B.A. Umesh,7 the delay of two years and three months in the disposal of the mercy petition was held as not excessive. 14. The learned counsel submitted that the major delay is on the part of the Sessions Court in issuing the warrants of execution of the death sentence. He submitted that on 19th June 2017, the Superintendent of Prison had communicated to the Sessions Court about the Hon’ble President of India’s rejection of the mercy petitions. There was an exchange of correspondence by the Government Officers with the Sessions Court, and only on 10th April 2019 were warrants issued for the execution of the death sentence issued by the Sessions Court. He submitted that in view of the decision of the Constitution Bench in the case of Triveniben,3 only the delay caused by the executive could be taken into consideration to decide whether there was any violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 15. As regards the finding of the High Court on keeping the convicts in solitary confinement before rejection of mercy petitions, the learned counsel pointed out that in the affidavit of the Superintendent of Prison, it was pointed out that the convicts were kept in a security yard wherein they were allowed to access the veranda and interact with other prisoners from 06:00 am to 06:30 pm.
