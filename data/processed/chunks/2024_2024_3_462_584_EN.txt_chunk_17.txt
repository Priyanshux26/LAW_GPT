The object behind conferring immunity on MPs and MLAs was to shield them from “being oppressed by the power of the crown”. The apprehension of parliamentarians being arrested shortly before or after the actual voting or making of a speech in the Parliament (such vote or speech directed against the Executive) was the precise reason for introducing the concept of privileges and immunities; 16.3. The concept of constitutional privileges and immunities is not in derogation of the Rule of Law, but it is a distinct feature of our constitutional structure. The majority preserves 10 The opinion authored by SP Bharucha, J has been referred to as majority hereinafter 11 The opinion authored by SC Agarwal, J has been referred to as minority hereinafter 12 Keshav Mills Co. Ltd v. CIT, [1965] 2 SCR 908 : AIR 1965 SC 1636, para 23; Krishena Kumar v. Union of India, [1990] 3 SCR 352 : (1990) 4 SCC 207, para 33; Shanker Raju v. Union of India, [2011] 2 SCR 1: (2011) 2 SCC 132, para 10; Shah Faesal and Ors. v. Union of India (UOI), [2020] 3 SCR 1115 : (2020) 4 SCC 1, para 17 486 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the privilege of MPs and MLAs to protect their dignity as legislators and is not opposed to the rule of law; 16.4. The majority gave due regard and recognition to Parliament’s exclusive powers to take appropriate steps against corrupt practices by its members, just as the Parliament recognizes the limits on discussions in the House, such as the inability to entertain discussions on the conduct of judges of constitutional courts under Article 121 of the Constitution; 16.5. The present position on parliamentary privilege in India and the UK entails that (a) it is fundamental to a democratic polity and courts have exercised judicial restraint; and (b) the privilege must necessarily relate to the exercise of “legislative functions”, which in India relates to voting and making of speeches. While determining whether an act is immune from judicial scrutiny, the ‘necessity test’ is to be applied, i.e., whether there is a nexus between the act in question and the legislative process of voting/making speeches; 16.6. The so-called “anomaly” in the majority flows from the plain language of Articles 105(2) and 194(2) and any attempt to whittle down their protective scope to adhere to what is seemingly “logical”, “fair” or “reasonable” would be constitutionally unjustified. However, while advancing his oral submissions in rejoinder, Mr Ramachandran conceded that the view that an abstention from voting would not be protected under Article 105(2) was incorrect and abstaining from voting, in fact, constitutes casting a vote; 16.7. The minority in PV Narasimha Rao (supra) has erred in reading “in respect of” as “arising out of”. Such a reading is not warranted by either the plain language or the intent of the provision; 16.8. The fact that the offence of bribery in criminal law is complete when the bribe is given and is not dependent on the performance of the promised favour is of no consequence to the constitutional immunity under Articles 105(2) and 194(2).
