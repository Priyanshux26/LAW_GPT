In the light of the same, the arbitral proceedings between the parties above-named before this Tribunal is closed forthwith with liberty being granted to both the parties to work out their respective remedies in accordance with law.” 8. Returning to the proceedings commenced before the Authority, we note that the respondent moved an application under Section 8 of the Act seeking reference of the dispute involved in the petition under Section 15(2) of the PW Act to arbitration. The Authority under PW Act dismissed the said application on 03.03.2022 holding that; “In view of Section 23 of the Payment of Wages Act, arbitration agreement cannot stand in the way of the claimant in respect of illegally deducted wages under Payment of Wages Act.” 6 [2019] 17 SCR 275 : (2020) 20 SCC 760 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 497 Dushyant Janbandhu v. M/s Hyundai Autoever India Pvt. Ltd. 9. There is yet another development. Questioning the of termination dated 21.01.2021, the appellant approached the Industrial Tribunal by filing a petition under Section 2(A) of the ID Act and the same is pending adjudication and determination by the Industrial Tribunal. 10. It is in the above referred background that the respondent approached the High Court by filing a petition under Section 11(6) of the Act in August 2022 seeking appointment of an arbitrator. The disputes between the appellant and the respondent, as indicated in the arbitration petition relate to non-payment of wages and also the legality and validity of termination dated 21.01.2021. Over and above these disputes, for the first time the respondent sought to give a new angle to the dispute by stating that the appellant has also violated the non-disclosure obligations under clause 19 of the appointment . 11. In the impugned before us, the High Court has proceeded to note an arbitration agreement and therefore, appointed an advocate as the arbitrator. 12. The issue relating to violation of the non-disclosure obligation under clause 19 is only an afterthought. This was evidently not the ground when the respondent issued the show cause notice on 04.09.2020, nor was it a part of the inquiry report, the relevant portion of which we have extracted in the para 3 above. This is also not a part of the charge memo dated 25.11.2020. 13. Crucially, the termination was not based on any such allegation as is evident from the termination dated 21.01.2021 that we have extracted earlier. Under these circumstances, we can conclude that there is no dispute about violation of non-disclosure obligations and Section 11(6) petition, to this extent is non-existent. 14. Insofar as other disputes are concerned, they relate to non-payment of wages and the legality and validity of the of termination dated 21.01.2021. The appellant approached the Authority under the PW Act much before the of termination and the said authority would exercise jurisdiction under Section 15(2) of the PW Act to the exclusion of civil courts and these disputes are non-arbitrable. Section 22 of the PW Act reads as under: “22.
