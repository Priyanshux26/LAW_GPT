2. At the outset, we must clarify that this is not an appeal against refusal or grant of bail. Instead, this appeal impugns the validity of arrest under Section 19 of the PML Act. It raises a pivotal question regarding the scope and ambit of the trial court/courts to examine the legality of the arrest under Section 19. The issue is legal in nature, and with the ratio being propounded in detail, the decision becomes complex and legalistic.4 1 For short, the “Code”. 2 For short, “DoE”. 3 For short, the “PML Act”. 4 While introducing the Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill, 2012 in the Rajya Sabha on 17.12.2012, the then Finance Minister, Mr. P Chidambaram, stated, “Firstly, we must remember that money-laundering is a very technically-defined offence. It is not the way we understand ‘money- laundering in a colloquial sense.” This has been quoted with approval in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary and others v. Union of India and others, (2022) SCC OnLine SC 929, at paragraph 35. 2372 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 3. On 17.08.2022, the Central Bureau of Investigation5 registered RC No. 0032022A0053 for the offences punishable under Section 120B read with Section 477A of the Indian Penal Code, 18606 and Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The registration was based on a complaint dated 20.07.2022, made by the Lieutenant Governor of the Government of National Capital Territory7 of Delhi, and on the directions of the competent authority conveyed by the Director, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. 4. Later, on 25.11.2022, the CBI filed a chargesheet. Thereafter, on 25.04.2023 and 08.07.2023, two supplementary chargesheets were filed. On 15.12.2022, the Special Court took cognisance of the offences. The chargesheets inter alia allege that the excise policy, framed for the sale of liquor in NCT of Delhi, was a product of criminal conspiracy. It was hatched by a cartel of liquor manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers and it provided undue pecuniary gain to public servants and other accused in the conspiracy. It resulted in huge losses to the government exchequer and ultimately to the public. Arvind Kejriwal is not an accused in the said chargesheets. 5. On 22.08.2022, the DoE recorded ECIR No. HIU-II/14/2022 based on offences detailed under the RC registered by CBI. The offences under the RC are the predicate offence for investigation/inquiry into the scheduled offences under the PML Act. On 26.11.2022, the DoE filed the first prosecution complaint. On 20.12.2022, the Special Court took cognisance. Since then, the DoE has filed seven supplementary prosecution complaints. In the last complaint, that is, the Seventh Supplementary Prosecution Complaint dated 17.05.2024, Arvind Kejriwal has been named as an accused. 6. On 30.10.2023, Arvind Kejriwal was issued notice under Section 50 of the PML Act for his appearance and recording of statement. Thereafter, eight summons were issued till his arrest on 21.03.2024. DoE states that Arvind Kejriwal failed to appear and join the investigation. Arvind Kejriwal claims that the summons and notices under Section 50 were illegal, bad in law and invalid.8 5 For short, “CBI”.
