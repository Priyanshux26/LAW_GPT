RAVINDRA LOONKAR, RESOLUTION PROFESSION OF ACIL LIMITED & ANR.1 R1 : Ravindra Loonkar, Resolution Profession(al) of ACIL Limited R2 : Committee of Creditors of ACIL Ltd. (Civil Appeal No.1527 of 2022) NOVEMBER 21, 2023 [VIKRAM NATH AND AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: The moot question involved is the extent of the jurisdiction and powers of the Adjudicating Authority to go on the issue of revaluation in the background of the admitted and undisputed factual position that no objection was raised by any quarter with regard to any defi ciency/irregularity, either by the RP or the appellant or the CoC, in fi nally approving the Resolution Plan which was sent to the Adjudicating Authority-NCLT for approval. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – The Adjudicating Authority-NCLT by dated 01.09.2021, the application seeking approval of a Resolution Plan for ACIL or corporate debtor was kept in abeyance while directing the offi cial liquidator (OL) to carry out a re-valuation of the assets of the corporate debtor and provide exact fi gures/value of the assets and exact value details – NCLAT upheld the of the NCLT – Propriety: Held: If the CoC, including the FC(s) to whom money is due from the Corporate Debtor, had undertaken repeated negotiations with 1 Cause-title should correctly include ‘Resolution Professional’ instead of ‘Resolution Profession’ 672 RAMKRISHNA FORGINGS LTD v. RAVINDRA LOONKAR, 673 R. P. OF ACIL LTD. the appellant with regard to the Resolution Plan and thereafter, with a majority of 88.56% votes, approved the fi nal negotiated Resolution Plan of the appellant, which the RP, in turn, presented to the Adjudicating Authority-NCLT for approval, unless the same was failing the tests of the provisions of the Code, especially Sections 30 & 31, no interference was warranted – It is worthwhile to note that the Adjudicating Authority has jurisdiction only u/s. 31(2) of the Code, which gives power not to approve only when the Resolution Plan does not meet the requirement laid down u/s. 31(1) of the Code, for which a reasoned is required to be passed – The NCLT’s jurisdiction and powers as the Adjudicating Authority under the Code, fl ow only from the Code and the Regulations thereunder – The dated 01.09.2021 by the NCLT cannot withstand judicial scrutiny, either on facts or in law – Also, the said is cryptic and bereft of details – Accordingly, the dated 01.09.2021 of the NCLT and impugned of the NCLAT are set aside.
