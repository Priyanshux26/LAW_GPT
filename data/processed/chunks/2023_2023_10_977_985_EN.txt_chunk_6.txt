The total emoluments of the deceased father of the respondent were Rs.3,210/- per month at the time of his death which is lesser than the total net income of the deceased’s family. Thus, the total income of the family is not less than 60% of the total emoluments which the deceased C was drawing at the time of his death as per the Scheme under consideration. In that view of the matter, the High Court ought to have taken into consideration the factual details rather than just referring to the s in answering the questions of law. 20. As far as the first question of law is concerned, it has been D clarified during the course of arguments by the learned counsel for the respondent that the respondent was eligible to be considered for the post of Peon as he had passed 8th standard during the life time of his father and thus, was eligible to be considered to the said post as on the date on which he made the said application. We do not think that the said argument E would be of assistance to the respondent inasmuch as the respondent is not qualified or is eligible to be considered for said post on compassionate basis having regard to the family income of the respondent. 21. In the circumstances, we are of the view that the High Court was not right in answering the questions of law in favour of the respondent F and thereby, setting aside the of the First Appellate Court and restoring the of the Trial Court. 22. In the result, the appeal is allowed and the of the High Court is set aside and the suit of the respondent is dismissed. 23. The Parties to bear their respective costs. G 24. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Divya Pandey Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Roopanshi Virang, LCRA) H
