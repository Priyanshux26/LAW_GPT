As a result, the appellate decree, while retaining the principal decretal amount of Rs. 8,000/-, reduced the pre-suit interest from Rs. 2880/- to Rs. 1440/- and the pendente lite interest from Rs. 15360/- to Rs. 7680/- and denied costs of Rs. 1454/- altogether. The total decretal amount of Rs.27694/- thus stood reduced to Rs. 17120/-. 3.3 Before the decision rendered by the appellate court reducing the decretal amount, as above, the plaintiff/decree holder executed the decree and the properties of the defendant/ debtor as mentioned (supra) were put to auction and were purchased by the original plaintiffs/decree holders themselves for a sum of Rs. 34000/- in the auction dated 09.08.1985 which was confirmed by the Executing Court i.e. 2nd Joint Civil Judge, Senior Division, Ahmednagar in Special Darkhast No. 100 of 1982 on 23.09.1985. The first property in auction admeasuring 24 acres was subsequently sold by the plaintiff in favour of respondent no. 3 herein vide registered sale deed dated 17.07.2009 for a sum of Rs.3.9 Lakhs. 3.4 On 29.01.1990, the present appellant/ debtor moved an application for restitution under Section 144 CPC on the ground that the original decree having been varied, substantially, the execution sale deserves to be set aside and reversed by way of restitution. The appellant/ debtor also deposited the entire decretal amount (as finally decreed by the appeal court) in the Trial Court. As noted above, the courts below have concurrently rejected the appellant/ debtor’s application for restitution basing the reasoning that he had not deposited any amount in court, when the suit was originally decreed and the decree was put in execution, and not even a part of the amount which was finally decreed by the appeal court was deposited, hence, the principle of restitution is not invokable. 4. Mr. D.N. Goburdhan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant/ debtor has strenuously urged that the auction purchaser, being the decree holder, in the present case, is not entitled to any equity, which a bona fide auction purchaser with no [2024] 6 S.C.R. 631 Bhikchand S/o Dhondiram Mutha (Deceased) Through Lrs. v. Shamabai Dhanraj Gugale (Deceased) Through Lrs. knowledge of the litigation, or the pending appeal would have in such matter. Reliance is placed on Binayak Swain vs. Ramesh Chandra Panigrahi & Anr2. & Chinnamal & Ors. Vs. Arumugham & Anr3. It is further argued that even an assignee of a decree holder/ auction purchaser (respondent no. 3 herein) cannot be equated with a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. Reference is made to the decision of this Court in Padanathil Rugmini Ama Vs. P.K. Abdulla4. It is then argued that where a decree holder himself is an auction purchaser, the sale cannot stand not only in the case of reversal of a decree but also on any variation or modification of it. It is submitted that the debtor’s right under Section 144 CPC is ignited immediately after reversal or modification of the decree. Referring to South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. Vs. State of M.P.
