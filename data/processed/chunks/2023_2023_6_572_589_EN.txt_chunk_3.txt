This batch of appeals arises from a dated 18 July 2018 of a Division Bench of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir. A public interest litigation was instituted before the High Court by two practicing advocates with the grievance that cinema theatres in Jammu and Kashmir were prohibiting movie goers from bringing eatables inside E cinema halls. In this context, it was averred that cinema owners paste a notice outside the hall indicating the prohibition and that security personnel search the belongings of every cinema goer with a view to enforce the prohibition. In the event that movie goers are found in possession of eatables, they are (it was alleged) prevented from entering the cinema F hall. 3. The submission which was urged before the High Court was that, as a consequence of the prohibition, movie goers are compelled to consume food and beverages which are made available within the precincts of cinema halls resulting in the audience being required to G purchase food at “highly exorbitant rates.” Moreover, it was submitted that the food which is sold is not necessarily of a nutritious quality and that persons with chronic diseases (such as diabetes) may be required to eat a specific type of food which would not be available at the movie hall.
