Disposing of the appeals, the Court HELD: 1.1 At the relevant time, ‘Pan Masala’ was described as a preparation containing betel nuts and any one or more other D ingredients such as lime, katha, katechu, cardamom, copra, menthol and tobacco. This is the definition of Pan Masala under the CET Act which continued till 1995. Heading 21.06 covered ‘Pan Masala’ containing “lime, katha, katechu, cardamom, copra, menthol and tobacco” or any one or more of these ingredients. Chapter 24 dealt with tobacco and manufactured tobacco E substitutes and the relevant sub-heading at that time was 2404.41 which deals with chewing tobacco, including preparations commonly known as khara masala, kimam, dokta, zarda, sukha and surti. Parliament Act 22 of 1995, substituted Note-3 to Chapter 21 of the CET Act. “Pan Masala” was described as “any F preparation containing betel nuts and any one or more of the following ingredients, viz., lime, katha, katechu or tobacco, whether or not containing any other ingredients such as cardamom, copra and menthol”. The primary ingredient of pan masala therefore, is betel nut, which could be mixed with other ingredients in combination or in isolation. This position prevailed G as on 01.03.1988. In 1995, the definition underwent a change. Betel nuts remained the essential ingredient along with “lime, katha or tobacco” together, or separately. Whether the product contained cardamom, copra, and menthol or not was irrelevant: H 1048 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A yet one of the three ingredients (lime, katha and tobacco), had to be found in the preparation known as ‘pan masala’. By Parliament Act 33 of 1996, the description to Chapter Heading 24.04 and sub-headings under it were re-numbered. The description of goods was reclassified. There was no change in Chapter 21; Heading 21.06 continued to be only ‘pan masala’. That changed B with effect from 01.03.2001, through Note-3. Entry No. 2 of Part- J in the First Schedule to the ADE Act is similar to sub-heading 2404.49 - as amended from 01.03.2001. As a result, additional excise duty could be imposed on ‘’Pan Masala containing tobacco”. [Paras 46, 47 and 49][1070-G-H; 1071-B-D; 1072-C- C D] 1.2 As far as the first point argued by the appellants are concerned, which is, whether in a state law which contains two provisions: one which taxes entries, and another which exempts articles from levy (the latter being listed separately, in a notification, D or a schedule to the enactment itself), the inclusion, or insertion into the list or schedule of articles that can be taxed (like Section 4 of the DST Act) without amending the subsisting notification that excludes levy (as under Section 7 DST) would the levy fail? There was apparent conflict between two lines of s of this court i.e., Radheshyam Gudakhu Factory and Kothari Products E Ltd. on the one hand, and Dealing Dairy Products, Krishna Kuthar Kabra and Agra Belting Works on the other hand. This court, in the latter three s held that notification introducing an entry and subjecting it to levy, when previously, it was exempt in another part of the taxing statute, the intention was to withdraw F the exemption and make the sale leviable to tax at the rate prescribed in the later notification.
