Therefore, the NCDRC rightly held that it had the requisite pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the complaint, and this Court affirms that finding. 20. The appellant’s key contention regarding the absence of the completion certificate and firefighting clearance certificate merits [2024] 9 S.C.R. 107 Dharmendra Sharma v. Agra Development Authority serious consideration. The appellant consistently raised this issue, asserting that a valid offer of possession cannot be made without these documents. Section 4(5) of the UP Apartment (Promotion of Construction, Ownership & Maintenance) Act, 2010 and Section 19(10) of the RERA Act, 2016 mandate that a developer must obtain these certificates before offering possession. Despite the appellant’s repeated requests, ADA failed to produce these certificates, rendering its offer of possession incomplete and legally invalid. 21. The appellant has rightly cited relevant precedents to bolster this argument. In Debashis Sinha v. R.N.R. Enterprise (2023),13 this Court held that possession offered without the requisite completion certificate is illegal, and a purchaser cannot be compelled to take possession in such circumstances. The Court in that case held: “20. Finally, we cannot resist but comment on the perfunctory approach of Ncdrc while dealing with the appellants’ contention that it was the duty of the respondents to apply for and obtain the completion certificate from KMC and that the respondents ought to have been directed to act in accordance with law. The observation made by Ncdrc of the respondents having successfully argued that it was not their fault, that no completion certificate of the project could be obtained, is clearly contrary to the statutory provisions. 21. Sub-section (2) of Section 403 of the KMC Act was referred to by Ncdrc in the impugned [Debashis Sinha v. R.N.R. Enterprise, 2020 SCC OnLine NCDRC 429] . Sub-section (1) thereof, which finds no reference therein, requires every person giving notice under Section 393 or Section 394 or every owner of a building or a work to which the notice relates to send or cause to be delivered or sent to the Municipal Commissioner a notice in writing of completion of erection of building or execution of work within one month of such completion/erection, accompanied by a certificate in the form specified in the rules made in this behalf as well as to give to the Municipal Commissioner all necessary facilities for inspection of such building or work. 13 (2023) 3 SCC 195 108 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 22. Section 393 mandates every person, who intends to erect a building, to apply for sanction by giving notice in writing of his intention to the Municipal Commissioner in such form and containing such information as may be prescribed together with such documents and plans. Similarly, Section 394 also mandates every person who intends to execute any of the works specified in clause (b) to clause (m) of sub-section (1) of Section 390 to apply for sanction by giving notice in writing of his intention to the Municipal Commissioner in such form and containing such information as may be prescribed.
