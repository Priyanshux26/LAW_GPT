19. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we are of the opinion that the NCDRC ought not to have interfered with the findings and the impugned and of the State Commission so as to hold the doctor of the PGI negligent and to award compensation. 20. Accordingly, the and dated 24.08.2011 of the NCDRC is hereby set aside and that of the State Commission is restored. Since the complainants have failed to prove any negligence on part of the doctor or the PGI, they are not entitled to any compensation as such, no question arises for its enhancement. 21. Accordingly, Civil Appeal No. 272 of 2012 is allowed and Civil Appeal No. 5526 of 2012 is dismissed. Result of the case: Appeals disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
