v. Union of India & Ors.,1 Section 17(5)(d) was required to be read down as the very purpose of ITC is to benefit the assessee. The High Court held that if the assessee is required to pay GST on the rental income from the mall, it is entitled to ITC on the GST paid on the construction of the mall. It was held that the narrow interpretation given by the Department to Section 17(5)(d) would frustrate the very object of the Act. Civil Appeal No. 2949 of 2023 takes exception to the same . 5. In the Writ Petitions, the petitioners contend that due to the restrictions imposed by Section 17(5)(c) and Section 17(5)(d) of the CGST 1 [1999] 1 SCR 295 : (1999) 2 SCC 361 800 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Act, they are unable to avail the credit on GST paid on goods and services used in the construction of factory premises, buildings etc against the GST received by them for the renting/leasing/letting out etc. of the premises. GST is being recovered on the supply of goods and services used in the construction of commercial office buildings, and GST is also being recovered on rentals collected. Accordingly, several writ petitions have been preferred seeking the following reliefs: a. Writ Petition (C) No. 90 of 2023 challenging clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) of the CGST Act to the extent to which it excludes works contract services and goods from ITC. It is also prayed that the bar imposed by Section 16(4) should not apply to the petitioner; b. Writ Petition (C) No. 804 of 2022 challenging the validity of Section 17(5)(d) of the CGST Act; c. Writ Petition (C) No. 846 of 2023 challenging the validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) of the CGST Act. There is another prayer to read down the provisions; d. Writ Petition (C) No. 847 of 2023 challenging the constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5). There is a prayer to read down the clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4) of the CGST Act; e. Writ Petition (C) No. 1036 of 2023 challenging the constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5). There is a prayer to read down the clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4) of the CGST Act; and f. Writ Petition (C) No. 1030 of 2022 containing similar prayers SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF ASSESSEES 6. Very detailed submissions have been made by the parties to the civil appeals, intervenors and parties to the writ petitions. We find that the submissions made by the learned counsel for the assessees and the intervenors are repetitive. There are a large number of decisions relied upon, whether relevant or irrelevant. Brevity is the hallmark of good advocacy. It would be ideal if parties on one side file joint written submissions. The Judges and lawyers are humans. Sometimes, bulky compilations and submissions can be counterproductive.
