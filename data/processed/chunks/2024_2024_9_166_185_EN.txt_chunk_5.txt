K. Govinde Gowda v. Smt. Akkayamma and others,9 and contends that the scope of jurisdiction in receiving in evidence insufficiently stamped instruments by every person, having by law or consent of parties, authority to receive evidence and every person in charge of a public office on the one hand and the Deputy Commissioner/District Registrar on the other hand, is fairly well- settled by the binding precedents. The scope of discretion available in two distinct forums covered by Sections 34 and 39 of the Act is fairly well settled and defined. 12.1. It is further argued that the ratio in Chilakuri Gangulappa (supra) is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case. The trial court while considering the prayer for an injunction by relying on the suit document, exercised its jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act. The procedure under Section 37(2) of the Act arises in the cases not attracting Section 37(1) of the Act. The discretionary jurisdiction under Section 39 of the Act is exclusive to the District Registrar/ Deputy Commissioner while exercising the powers under the Act. Thus, expecting the court to exercise the discretion of Section 39 of the Act is untenable. 1 [2018] 13 SCR 603 : (2019) 3 SCC 788 2 [2020] 11 SCR 268 : (2020) 9 SCC 510 3 ILR 2013 KAR 2099 4 ILR 1999 KAR 4634 5 (2013) SCC OnLine Kar 10138 6 (2023) SCC OnLine Cal 1391 7 (2016) SCC OnLine Kar 1077 8 [2001] 2 SCR 419 : (2001) 4 SCC 197 9 ILR 2011 KAR 4719 174 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports III. Analysis 13. We have perused the record and noted the rival submissions. The following points arise in the Civil Appeals: I. Whether the agreement of sale dated 29.06.1999, with a recital on delivery of possession to the appellant, conforms to the definition of conveyance under Section 2(d) read with Article 20(1) of the Schedule of the Act or not? II. Whether, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the dated 23.01.2019 of trial court, as confirmed by the impugned s dated 23.08.2019 and 14.09.2021, are legal and valid or call for interference by this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India? Point I 14. Agreement of sale dated 29.06.1999, among other clauses, refers to the alleged delivery of possession in favour of the appellant by the respondent. Article 5 of the Schedule of the Act deals with an agreement of sale coupled with possession and the requirement of paying the ad valorem stamp duty. If an instrument conforms to the requirements of conveyance under Section 2(d) read with Article 20(1) of the Schedule of the Act, the applicable stamp duty is ad valorem. In other words, ad valorem stamp duty is paid on such instruments. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant has not argued on the applicability of the clause dealing with possession in the agreement and requirement to ad valorem pay stamp duty. The relief of injunction is sought on the basis of delivery of possession by the respondent under the suit agreement.
