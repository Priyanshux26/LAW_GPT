However, the High Court entirely failed to consider sub-section (4), [2024] 5 S.C.R. 269 Life Insurance Corporation of India v. The State of Rajasthan and Ors. despite quoting it, which excludes instruments under Entry 91, List I from the application of Section 3A. Therefore, the High Court has committed an error in holding that the appellant could have paid the stamp duty in cash. 36. In view of the above circumstances, the appellant had no choice but to purchase the insurance stamps from outside the state. While it made every endeavour to purchase the stamp from within the state, due to the letter by the department and the lack of mechanism for payment of stamp duty under the 1952 Act in case of unavailability of insurance stamps, it was unable to purchase the stamps and pay the stamp duty to the Rajasthan government. 37. Therefore, having considered the matter in detail, we finally hold that: I. The preliminary issue relating to the applicability of the relevant state law, i.e., the 1952 Act or the 1998 Act, is answered by holding that the Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952 applies to the present case. II. We hold that the state legislature has the legislative competence to impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance under Entry 44 of List III, as per the rate prescribed by the Parliament under Entry 91 of List I. III. We hold that for the execution of insurance policies within the state of Rajasthan, the appellant is bound to purchase India Insurance Stamps and pay the stamp duty to the state of Rajasthan. IV. While we have upheld the power and jurisdiction of the state to levy and collect stamp duty on insurance policies, in the facts and circumstances of the case as indicated hereinabove, we direct that the state government shall not demand and collect the stamp duty as per the s dated 16.09.2004, 16.10.2004, 11.10.2004, 01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004. 38. In conclusion, we dismiss the appeals and affirm the of the High Court dated 21.02.2011 in D.B. Civil Special Appeal (Writ) No. 670 of 2004, D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3418 of 2006, D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3419 of 2006, D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3420 of 2006 and D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 8187 of 2004. We also set aside certain findings of the High Court to the extent indicated in 270 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports issue no. IV and direct the State Government not to demand and collect stamp duty as per the s dated 16.09.2004, 16.10.2004, 11.10.2004, 01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004. 39. Parties shall bear their own costs.
