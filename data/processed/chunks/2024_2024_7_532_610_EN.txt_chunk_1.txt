The Chief Executive Officer & Ors. materials and circumstances in to ensure that State actions are fair, transparent, and accountable – Public interest cannot be used as a pretext to arbitrarily terminate contracts and there must be a clear and demonstrable ramification or detriment on the public interest to justify any such action – Considerations of public interest should not be narrowly confined to financial aspects – Courts must have a more holistic understanding of public interest wherever the fairness of public authorities is in question, giving due regard to the broader implications of such action on the stability of contractual obligations – Merely because the financial terms of a contract are less favourable over a period of time does not justify its termination – Respondent’s stance of a mere possibility of fetching higher license fees was no ground to cancel the tender for the purposes of rectifying it, especially when it failed to demonstrate as to how there was a technical fault in the tender or how potential interested bidders did not participate due to it or how fetching higher license fees was more than a mere possibility.
