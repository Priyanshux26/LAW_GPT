The High Court allowed the petition and set aside the passed by the trial court. 5. We find no error not to speak of any error of law in the impugned passed by the High Court. 1320 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 6. We have noticed over a period of time the growing tendency on the part of the litigants in throwing the entire blame on the head of the advocate. Not only this, we have come across cases where the concerned advocate has filed an affidavit in favour of his client(s) saying that he was unable to attend the proceedings due to some personal reasons difficulties thereby facilitating the litigant to get the delay condoned. 7. Even if we assume for a moment that the concerned lawyer was careless or negligent, this, by itself, cannot be a ground to condone long and inordinate delay as the litigant owes a duty to be vigilant of his own rights and is expected to be equally vigilant about the judicial proceedings pending in the court initiated at his instance. 8. The litigant, therefore, should not be permitted to throw the entire blame on the head of the advocate and thereby disown him at any time and seek relief. 9. In view of the aforesaid, petition fails and is hereby dismissed. 10. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of. Result of the case: Petition dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Gaurav Upadhyay, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Liz Mathew, Sr. Adv.)
