The High Court held that the petitioners could legitimately claim that the measures for land allotment concern not only them but also the public at large. The plea of laches was dismissed, as the fresh allotment made after the dated 08.10.2007, in Writ Petition 13730/2006, constituted a fresh cause of action. The Court further stated that the Writ Petitions acted as a class action. 24. Regarding the validity of GoM Nos. 419, 420, and 422 to 425, the High Court noted that the earlier decision dated 08.10.2007, in Writ Petition 13730/2006, had outlined restrictions on land allotment for individuals who had already received similar government concessions, either directly or through Cooperative Societies. Contrary to the 14 [1985] Supp. 3 SCR 766 : (1986) 1 SCC 100 15 [2006] Supp. (1) SCR 86 : (2006) 4 SCC 683 1392 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Respondents’ claims, the Division Bench did not leave the final decision solely to the Government. It observed that the new GoM Nos. 419 to 425 failed to bar allotment to individuals who already owned land in their own name or that of their spouse or children. The earlier decision was unequivocal in stating that the principle of equality had been violated, as it did not restrict allotment of land to those who had already been allotted land at concessional rates or who privately owned a house or housing site. 25. The High Court further noted that while the earlier Division Bench could have quashed GoM No. 522, it chose to give the government an opportunity to comply with its directions. It went on to observe that the government improperly issued the new GoMs, rendering them invalid. It held that the allotment of land to those who already owned land in their own name or in the name of their spouse or children, cannot be sustained. As a result, the Division Bench quashed all the GoMs in its dated 05.01.2010, and directed that the various parcels of land be restored to the Government. Fresh allotments could be made only after issuing new GoMs in accordance with the High Court’s directions. contentIons and arguments raIsed by the partIes 26. To avoid prolixity and repetition, we will not separately refer to the arguments raised by the counsels for Cooperative Societies and their members as well as State of Telangana on one side, and the counsel for the Writ Petitioners, who, as noted above, have also challenged the impugned . 27. The contentions and pleas raised by the counsel for the Cooperative Societies, its members, and State of Telangana, can be crystallised as: (i) Successive governments have allotted lands in Hyderabad at concessional rates till 1989. (ii) The GoM Nos. 419 to 425 were issued after almost 18 years for allotment of housing sites as a one-time benefit. (iii) Allotment to members of AIS, government service, etc. on preferential basis does not violate Article 14 of the Constitution of India, as these officers constitute a separate class. Government servants play a vital role in governance and contribute to the society through their toil and sacrifice.
