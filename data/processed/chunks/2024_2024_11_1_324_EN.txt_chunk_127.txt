175 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. 216. India’s economic trajectory indicates that the Constitution and the custodians of the Constitution – the electorate – have routinely rejected one economic dogma as being the exclusive repository of truth. As participants ina vibrant multi-party ‘economic democracy’, the ‘People of India’ have voted to power governments which have adopted varied economic and social policies, based on the country’s evolving development priorities and challenges. The foresighted vision of our framers to establish an ‘economic democracy’ and trust the wisdom of the elected government, has been the backbone of the high-growth rate of India’s economy, making it one of the fastest- growing economies in the world.152 To scuttle this constitutional vision by imposing a single economic theory, which views the acquisition of private property by the state as the ultimate goal, would undermine the very fabric and principles of our constitutional framework. c. The interpretation is incompatible with the right to property 217. The right to property was included in the Constitution as a fundamental right under Articles 19(1)(f) and Article 31. Subsequently, the right to property was deleted from Part III of the Constitution by the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978. However, a modified version was inserted and the right to property continues to be constitutionally protected under Article 300A.153 Although no longer in the nature of a fundamental right, the provision has been characterised as a constitutional and human right.154 218. A two-Judge Bench of this Court in Kolkata Municipal Corporation & Anr v. Bimal Kumar Shah & Ors,155 speaking through Justice PS Narasimha, had occasion to discuss the scope and content of Article 300-A and the constitutional vision in relation to private property. This Court held that merely providing compensation does not justify compulsory acquisition by the state unless procedural safeguards are followed. It was observed that a “post-colonial reading” of the 152 Ministry of Finance (Department of Economic Affairs), Government of India, Economic Survey 2023-24, July 2024. 153 Article 300A of the Constitution: “Persons not to be deprived of property save by authority of law. – No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.” 154 Chandigarh Housing Board v.

Digital Supreme Court Reports constitutional right to property cannot be limited to the twin conditions of (a) the acquisition being for a public purpose; and (b) payment of compensation, and must give way to more meaningful renditions. This Court observed: “25. While it is true that after the 44th Constitutional Amendment, the right to property drifted from Part III to Part XII of the Constitution, there continues to be a potent safety net against arbitrary acquisitions, hasty decision-making and unfair redressal mechanisms. […] To assume that constitutional protection gets constricted to the mandate of a fair compensation would be a disingenuous reading of the text and, shall we say, offensive to the egalitarian spirit of the Constitution.
