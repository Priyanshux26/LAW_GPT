However, since the course was executed in Afghanistan by the petitioner as the franchisee, it is entitled to received 90% of the amount received as per the AELA franchise agreement. 28. The counsel further submitted that the respondent had neither informed nor disclosed the amount received from the ICCR despite repeated requests made by the petitioner for settlement of accounts. The petitioner further contended that the experience of the respondent with the ICCR and Government of India cannot be a ground for withholding of the payments by the respondent. 29. The counsel argued that the cause of action first arose on 03.10.2017 when the respondent withheld the information of receipt of Rs 73,53,000/- from the ICCR. The cause of action further arose on [2024] 3 S.C.R. 91 M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd. 28.03.2018 when the respondent informed that cash-flow wise it had received only 61.5% of the claimed amount from the ICCR and that it had incurred some incidental expenses for the project. 30. The petitioner contended that since the respondent has failed to disclose the amount received from ICCR till date, it has resulted in a continuing cause of action as the petitioner couldn’t quantify the total amount due along with interest as exact details of the amount received by the respondent from the ICCR were not disclosed. 31. The counsel submitted that as the cause of action for full and final settlement of claims was yet to accrue, the reliance placed by the respondent on the decision of this Court in M/s B and T AG v. Ministry of Defence reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 657 was misconceived. 32. The counsel submitted that a force majeure situation as per clause 13 of the AELA agreement was created due to the coming back of Taliban in Afghanistan in August, 2021. It was contended by the petitioner that this resulted in the break-down of all communication channels disabling the petitioner from approaching the courts on time despite of doing everything in its power. 33. The counsel further submitted that the petitioner is entitled to get the benefit of the extension of limitation period as directed by this Court in SMW(C) No. 03 of 2020 by which the period from 15.03.2020 to 28.02.2022 is liable to be excluded for the purposes of computing limitation. 34. The counsel submitted that upon failure of the respondent in replying to its claims and legal notice, it had approached the Bombay High Court Mediation Centre under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and had initiated pre-reference mediation in accordance with the terms of the arbitration clause in the AELA agreement. It was further submitted that in any view of the matter, the petitioner is not estopped from invoking arbitration under clause 21 of the AELA agreement after having invoked pre-litigation mediation under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. 35. Finally, the counsel prayed for passing an referring the dispute to arbitration with a view to adjudicate the differences between the parties as contemplated in clause 21 of the AELA agreement dated 21.03.2013.
