6. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and the learned ASG for the respondent State. 7. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the contents of the FIR and MLC report do not disclose any cognizable offence. The parties were in a consensual relationship. The institution of the FIR was with the ulterior motive of retribution due to a personal vengeance. There are umpteen contradictions in the FIR, MLC report and the statement made by the complainant under Section 164 CrPC. It was submitted that in the FIR dated 29.09.2019, the complainant stated that the appellant committed alleged forceful sexual acts on her in January 2019. However, in the MLC report dated 28.09.2019, she alleged that the incident of rape happened one week before the MLC. Further in the statement under Section 164 CrPC, she stated that the appellant used to take her to his room in Chhatarpur and forcibly committed rape on her. Hence, there is inconsistency in her statements. Therefore, it was prayed that this Court may set aside the impugned dated 16.10.2023 and quash the criminal proceedings pending against the appellant herein arising out of FIR No. 272 of 2019 dated 29.09.2019. 8. Per contra, the learned ASG for the respondent-State contended that a prima facie case has been made out and that the statements made under Section 164 CrPC are sufficient to constitute offences levelled against the appellant. Both FIR and MLC reports state that the appellant had a physical relationship with the complainant on false promise of marriage. The appellant had also threatened the complainant to kill her brother if she refused to have physical relationship with him. Only because of the said threat, the complainant [2024] 11 S.C.R. 829 Prashant v. State of NCT of Delhi reported the incident nine months later. Hence, the learned ASG argued that the High Court, vide impugned , was justified in dismissing the quashing petition filed by the appellant and prayed for the dismissal of the present appeal as well. 9. During the course of the arguments, it was also brought to the notice of this Court that the appellant got married in 2019 and the complainant was also married in the year 2020. 10. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having perused the material on record, the only question that falls for our consideration is, whether, FIR No. 272 of 2019 dated 29.09.2019 lodged against the appellant herein should be quashed. 11. In State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, this Court formulated the parameters in terms of which the powers under Section 482 of CrPC could be exercised. While it is not necessary to revisit all these parameters, a few that are relevant to the present case may be set out. The Court held that quashing may be appropriate: “102. … (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
