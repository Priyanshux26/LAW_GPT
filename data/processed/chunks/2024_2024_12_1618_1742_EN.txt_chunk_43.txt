5.9 It is only because the High Court has interfered in the matter and every step has been taken by the Borrowers and the Bank to defeat the vested rights of the Petitioner, that such extra-ordinary s are warranted. This is the only manner in which the Petitioner’s vested right as an auction purchaser can be protected and given effect to.” (Emphasis supplied) 120. On the very next day i.e., 05.09.2023 at 10:32 AM, the Borrower herein filed its written submissions wherein apart from contending that the right of redemption under the amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act does not get extinguished upon issuance of the notice of sale and that the impugned of the High Court warranted no interference of this Court in view of the fact that the mortgage has already been redeemed and that even the Secured Asset stood transferred to a third-party, the Borrower interestingly never raised the issue of the illegality of the 9th auction notice. Even though the petitioner herein had contended that it had a vested right in the Secured Asset and prayed for issuance of sale certificate to that effect and handing over of original title deeds, the Borrower remarkably neither disputed the same nor imputed any illegality in the very auction process through which the petitioner claimed its vested right. The Borrower having already waived/abandoned its right to challenge the legality of the auction proceedings before the High Court did not even put forth an alternative plea to preserve its right to pursue S.A. No. 46 of 2022 in the event this Court held that it had no right to redeem the mortgage. The entire written submissions of the Borrower is being reproduced hereunder: - 1678 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
