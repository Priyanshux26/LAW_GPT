In terms of this classification, the Central Board of Excise and Customs, Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue), Government of India, issued Circular No. 145/56/95-CX dated 31.08.1995, due to doubts being expressed about coconut oil packed in small containers and as to whether it would be classifiable as a fixed vegetable oil or as a cosmetic preparation under the Act of 1985.

It was further clarified that if the containers bore labels/literature indicating that it was meant for application on hair, as specified under Note 2 of Chapter 33 and/or if the oil had additives (other than BHA) or had undergone processes which made it a preparation for use on hair, as mentioned in Chapter Note 6 of Chapter 33, then the coconut oil merited classification under Chapter 33. 6.
