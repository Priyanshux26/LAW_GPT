Before the enactment of the Arbitration Act, the law on arbitration was contained in the Arbitration Act 1940,53 the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act 1937, and Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act 1961. In 1978, the Law Commission of India suggested substantial amendments to the 1940 Act to make it more responsive to the contemporary legal and economic requirements. In the meanwhile, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law54 adopted the Model Law in 1985 to foster the development of a unifi ed legal framework for the fair and effi cient settlement of disputes arising in international commercial arbitration. * Ed.

The General Assembly of the United Nations recommended to all states to give due consideration to the Model Law in view of the desirability of achieving uniformity of the law of arbitral procedure and the specifi c needs of international commercial arbitration practice.55 63. The Arbitration Act was enacted to “consolidate and amend the law relating to domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards as also to defi ne the law relating to the conciliation and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” In the process, the Arbitration Act repealed the 1940 Act, the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act 1937, and the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act 1961. It also brought domestic as well as international commercial arbitration in consonance with the Model Law, the New York Convention, and the Geneva Convention. The Arbitration Act is divided into four parts: (i) Part I deals with domestic and international arbitration that takes place in India; (ii) Part II deals with the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards under the New York Convention and the Geneva Convention; (iii) Part III deals with conciliation; and (iv) Part IV contains supplementary provisions. In the present reference, we are largely concerned with Part I of the Arbitration Act. The important principles which animate the law on arbitration as indeed the Arbitration Act are discussed in the following segment. These principles act as important aids to interpret the Arbitration Act. i. Arbitral autonomy 64. In medieval England, recourse to arbitration was commonplace among merchants and traders. During the seventeenth and the eighteenth century, settlement of commercial disputes by arbitration was encouraged by both Chancery and the courts.56 In light of the widespread use of arbitration, coupled with a rapid decline in court litigation, the English courts began to actively discourage arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism.57 Judicial 55 General Assembly of the United Nations, ‘Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law’ 40/72 112th Plenary Session, 11 December 1985. 56 Henry Horwitz and James Oldham, ‘John Locke, John Mansfi eld, and Arbitration during the Eighteenth Century’ (1993) 36(1) The Historical Journal 137, 139. 57 Earl Wolaver, ‘The Historical Background of Commercial Arbitration’ (1934) 83 University of Pennsylvania Law Review 132, 142.
