There is a possibility of deceased Sachin and Rahul (PW-1) coming to the shop of Satish and a fight taking place between the two groups. There is nothing on record to establish that there was any pre-meditation. As such, we find that the possibility of the offence being committed by the appellants without pre-meditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel cannot be ruled out. There is nothing on record to show that the appellants have taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. 16. In that view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the appellants are entitled to the benefit of doubt. We find that the present case would be covered under Part-I of Section 304 of IPC and as such, the conviction under Section 302 of IPC would not be tenable. 17. The appellants have undergone the sentence of more than 8 years without remission. We are therefore inclined to partly allow the appeals. 18. In the result, we pass the following : (i) The appeals are partly allowed; (ii) The conviction of the appellants under Section 302 of IPC is altered to Part-I of Section 304 of IPC; (iii) The appellants are sentenced to the period already undergone and are directed to be released forthwith if not required in any other case. 19. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the Case: Appeals partly allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
