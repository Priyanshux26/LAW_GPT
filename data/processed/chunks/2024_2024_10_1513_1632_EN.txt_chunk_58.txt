Article 34 of the CRC provides a right to protection from sexual exploitation and abuse, defining child marriage as a form of sexual exploitation.216 Article 19 prohibits all forms of physical or mental violence, abuse, or exploitation, with many young brides suffering these consequences.217 Child marriage frequently leads to violence against child wives, and although CEDAW does not specifically label child marriage as violence against women, it identifies forced marriage as a form of family violence in General Recommendations 19 on violence against women.218 The Committee interprets Articles 2(f), 5, and 10(c) together, recognizing that traditional attitudes regarding women’s subordination perpetuate practices involving violence or coercion, such as forced marriage.219 151. The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, adopted by the General Assembly, defines violence as any act 216 CRC, Article 34. 217 CRC, Article 19. 218 See CEDAW General Recommendation No. 19: Violence against Women, Adopted at the Eleventh Session of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (1992), Document A/47/38 [Para 11]. 219 Ibid, [Para 24]. 1594 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of GBV that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women.220 The Declaration calls on States to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish acts of violence against women. Article 4 requires member states to condemn violence against women and not invoke custom, tradition, or religion to evade their obligations to eliminate such violence.221 152. The Istanbul Convention is the first international treaty to contain a definition of gender as a socially constructed category that defines “women” and “men” according to socially assigned roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes.222 It firmly establishes the link between achieving gender equality and the eradication of violence against women. Based on this premise, it recognizes the structural nature of violence against women and that it is a manifestation of the historically unequal power relations between women and men. The Convention specifically asks State parties to ensure that culture, custom, religion, tradition or so-called ‘honour’ shall not be considered as justification for any acts of violence. Evidently, the human and fundamental right against GBV has found firm roots in the international sphere. This affords protection against child marriage, as it is a form of GBV that disproportionately affects girls and women. It subjects them to early and forced marriages perpetuating power imbalances and often leading to physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. ii. Right to education 153. The right to education is violated by the commission of child marriage under international law. These rights are manifested in the rights of children to – primary education, information, and sex education. a. Right to primary education 154. The CRC mandates that States ensure primary education is free and compulsory. Article 28 states that the child has the right to education,223 220 UN General Assembly, Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, A/RES/48/104, UN General Assembly (20 December 1991). 221 DEVAW, Article 4. 222 Council of Europe (2014).
