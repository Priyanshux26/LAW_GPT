14. On the issue of assessment of income, we are of the view that that an enhanced income should be considered for calculation of compensation. In this regard, the appellant has produced on record his income tax returns for the assessment years 2010-11 and 2011-12 as Exhibits 14 and 15, respectively. As per the records, for the assessment year 2010-11 (the financial year will be 2009-10), the income shown by the appellant was to the tune of ₹1,65,100/-. For the assessment year 2011-12 (the financial year will be 2010-11), the income was shown as ₹1,77,400/-. Further, as per the Salary Certificate Exhibit-22 placed on record by the appellant, he was working as Branch Manager for Padma Infrastructure and he was getting a consolidated salary of ₹22,000 one year prior to the date of accident. Now, it is to be noted that the accident took place on 16.01.2014, in the financial year 2013-14. If we calculate the annual income considering ₹22,000, it would come out to ₹2,64,000/- per annum. However, as per the High Court and the Tribunal, the annual income is assessed at ₹1,62,420/-. However, both the courts below failed to consider the fact that there is a gap of approximately 02 years [2024] 10 S.C.R. 927 Chandramani Nanda v. Sarat Chandra Swain and Another and 09 months between the said income tax returns and the date of accident. It can be seen that the income of the appellant, based on the income tax returns so produced on record is progressive, there is a possibility that he may have left his business and join service to improve his income. Thus, in our view, it would be reasonable to take the income of the appellant at ₹2,00,000/- per annum, i.e., ₹16,666.67 per month. 14.1 With respect to the multiplier, we do not find any error in the passed by the High Court applying the multiplier of 16 considering the age of the appellant as 32 years on the date of the accident. 14.2 On the point of assessment of functional disability as 100% by the High Court as against 60% by the Tribunal, there is no challenge by the insurance company. 14.3 However, the Tribunal and the High Court both have failed to consider the fact that the appellant is also entitled for enhancement on account of future prospects. Hence, in line with the law laid down in National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi and Others,10 given the age of appellant was 32 years at the time of accident, he is entitled to 40% future prospects. 15. As far as award of amount on account of medical expenditure is concerned, we do not find any case to be made out for further enhancement, as the amount awarded is in tune with the bills placed by the appellant on record. 16. Coming to the compensation under the head of attendant, Tribunal awarded a meagre sum of ₹10,000/-. While this amount may have been awarded considering the cost of attendant charges incurred during the period of appellant’s treatment, as he remained admitted in hospital for 25 days and had to undergo surgery post initial operation as well.
