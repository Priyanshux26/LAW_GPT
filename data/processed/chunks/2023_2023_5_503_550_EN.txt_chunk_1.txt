H HAJI ABDUL GANI KHAN & ANR. v. UNION OF INDIA & 505 ORS. Delimitation Act, 2002 – ss.10(6) and 10A – Jammu and A Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 – s.62 – Action of constituting a Delimitation Commission for the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir – Delimitation exercise – Time limit provided u/s.10(6) – If mandatory – Held: s.10A of the Act, 2002 itself indicates that the time limit of 31st July 2008 fixed under sub-Section (6) of s.10 is not B sacrosanct as it confers a power on the Hon’ble President to defer the delimitation exercise in a State under certain circumstances – Sub-section (6) of s.10 of the Delimitation Act, 2002 uses the word “endeavour” – Thus, the time limit provided in sub-section (6) of s.10 was never intended to be mandatory – While amending s.2(f) of the Delimitation Act by the J&K Reorganisation Act, sub-section C (6) of s.10 has not been amended for enlarging the period provided thereunder – However, the intention of the legislature as reflected in sub-sections (2) and (3) of s.62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act is crystal clear – The very fact that the duty of making the readjustment as per sub-sections (2) and (3) of s.62 on the basis of the 2011 D census figures has been entrusted to the Delimitation Commission suggests that the legislature intended that the Delimitation Commission for the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir will remain unaffected by the requirement of completing the exercise by the end of July 2008 – The provisions of sub-Sections (2) and (3) of s.62 will have to be interpreted in a manner that gives effect to the E intention of the legislature – If it is held that due to the failure of the legislature to modify the time limit provided in sub-Section (6) of s.10 of the Delimitation Act, 2002, the Central Government is powerless to appoint a Delimitation Commission for the newly created Union territory, the provisions of s.62 of the J&K F Reorganisation Act will be rendered nugatory.

A nothing wrong if the Central Government extended the period of appointment of the Chairperson till the task of delimitation/ readjustment was completed – Delimitation Act, 2002 is silent about the term of the appointment of the Chairperson.
