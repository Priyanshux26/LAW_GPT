7. We have perused the material on record and find that the dying declaration recorded by the Executive Magistrate (Naib Tehsildar), PW-11, which was endorsed by Dr. Avinash Saxena, PW-9 is reliable and trustworthy. The dying declaration recorded by PW-11 is in question-answer form. In the said dying declaration, the deceased clearly implicates the present appellant. The Medical Officer, PW-9, before the commencement of the dying declaration has given an endorsement regarding fit mental status of the deceased to make a declaration and at the end of the dying declaration again he has endorsed that the deceased was in a fit state of mind. The written dying declaration is corroborated by the oral dying declaration as has come on record in the evidence of her grand-father Sohan Singh (PW-1), her grand-father’s brother Mukund Singh (PW-2), her aunt Preeti (PW-13) and her uncle Sandeep Singh Rajpoot (PW-14). 8. In the said dying declaration, all the witnesses have clearly stated that the deceased after coming out from the room in flames has narrated the incident about the appellant committing the crime. Not only this, but DW-1-Golu Chaubey who was examined on behalf of the defence has also clearly stated that when the deceased came out of the house, she was shouting that the accused person(s) had committed rape on her and set her on fire. The statement of the deceased recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, Cr.P.C.) by Smt. Suchita Srivastava, Judicial Magistrate First Class, Sagar (PW-23) also supports the 2 [2015] 5 SCR 1112 : (2015) 6 SCC 652 : 2015 INSC 392 3 [2013] 14 SCR 297 : (2013) 10 SCC 421 : 2013 INSC 638 42 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports prosecution case. The Dehat Nalishi (Ex. P/28) recorded by Sub Inspector, Anjana Parmaar (PW-16) also narrates the same factual position. 9. In that view of the matter, we do not find that there is any error in the concurrent s of the Trial Judge and the High Court convicting the appellant for the offences punishable under Sections 450, 376(2) (i), 376D, 376A and 302 read with 34 of the IPC and Section 5(g)/6 of the POCSO. 10. The question that now requires to be considered is as to whether the present case would fall in the category of ‘rarest of rare case’ so as to confirm the death penalty or the sentence could be commuted. 11. We have perused the psychological assessment of the present appellant as conducted by the Department of Psychiatry, NSCB Medical College, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh so also the report of the Senior Probation and Welfare Officer, Central Jail, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh dated 12.06.2023 and the report of the Divisional Officer, Western Division/Assistant Jail Superintendent, Central Jail Jabalpur dated 10.06.2023. 12. In the said reports, it has been found that there is nothing against the behaviour of the appellant herein in the prison. His conduct in the prison has been found to be satisfactory. The reports further reveal that though not allotted any work, the appellant is engaging himself in plantation of trees, cleaning the temple and surrounding area.
