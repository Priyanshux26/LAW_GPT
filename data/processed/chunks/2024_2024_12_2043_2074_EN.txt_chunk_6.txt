He relied upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of M.C. Chacko v. State Bank of Travancore4 and Essar Steel Ltd. v. Gramercy Emerging Market Fund.5 17. The learned senior counsel submitted that the entire CIRP of the Corporate Debtor has proceeded on the basis that the appellants are Financial Creditors of the Corporate Debtor. They have participated and voted as Financial Creditors. Therefore, at this belated stage, when the proceeds of the approved Resolution Plan have been realised and are pending distribution, the entire process cannot be overturned, and the appellants cannot be removed from the list of Financial Creditors. 18. In the alternative, the learned counsel contended that appellants are entitled to receive a payout commensurate to their security interest. The learned counsel submitted that the RP accepted that the appellants were secured Financial Creditors. Therefore, the security interest of the appellants cannot be extinguished during the CIRP of the Corporate Debtor, and the appellants ought to be paid at least the commensurate value as per the security interest held 1 2022 INSC 630 : (2022) 9 SCC 186 2 2021 INSC 359 : (2023) 3 SCC 753 3 2022 INSC 1004 : AIR 2022 SC 4595 4 1969 INSC 151 : (1969) 2 SCC 343 5 2002 SCC OnLine Guj 319 2052 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports in the event their status as Financial Creditors is not accepted. He relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Vistra ITCL (India) Ltd. & Ors. v. Dinkar Venkatasubramanian6 on the entitlement of the secured creditor. Submissions in Civil Appeal no. 7407 of 2022 19. The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants in Civil Appeal No. 7407 of 2022 also made detailed submissions and pointed out the factual aspects of the case. The learned senior counsel pointed out that the appellants’ claim as Financial Creditors was admitted by the RP in August 2019. He referred to the relevant portion of the minutes of the CoC meeting held on 2nd August 2019. He pointed out that the extracts of the minutes show that in response to the query made whether there was any deed of guarantee, the learned counsel appearing for the RP made it clear that while there was no deed of guarantee, there was a legal obligation in the DoH under which, the Corporate Debtor had undertaken to pay the shortfall. The learned senior counsel analysed clause 5(iii) of the DoH. He pointed out that the Chargors (including the Corporate Debtor) have agreed to accept the Security Trustee’s account of the expenses, sales and realisation and to pay on demand by the Security Trustee any shortfall. He pointed out that Clause 2.15 of MSTA clarifies that the security created under the DoH is in addition to and independent of any other rights or remedies available to the appellants in law, equity or otherwise. More importantly, there is a personal covenant to pay on the part of the Chargors. He pointed out that clause 5(iii) of the DoH provides protection to the Security Trustee precisely because there is an obligation on the Chargors to pay the shortfall/ deficiency in payment of debt.
