be directed to pay Rs. 30,00,000/- (Rupees Thirty lacs only) against the value of the allotted land. It was further stated that in case the full amount is deposited, BMC is ready to fulfil its obligations. It therefore prayed that the parties may be relegated to a Mediator/Arbitrator for settlement of the dispute under Section 89 CPC. This application is dated 27.08.2004. (xvi). The Trial Court, by dated 17.09.2004, referred the matter to Shri Hemant Kumar. The said Arbitrator/Mediator in less than a month gave an award/report dated 14.10.2004. In brief, the said award was to the effect that the plaintiff would pay Rs. 30,00,000/- to BMC and such lease rent as maybe determined, and in turn the BMC would fulfil its obligation of allotment of land, as per the agreement dated 30.07.1991. (xvii). The Appellant-State of Madhya Pradesh filed objections dated 09.11.2004 to the award of the Arbitrator dated 14.10.2004 praying for setting aside the same on various grounds. It was specifically stated in the objections that the ownership of the land still remains with the State of Madhya Pradesh and that BMC had no business or right to deal with such land without the written consent or approval of the State. (xviii). The Trial Court, after inviting objections to the application of the State dated 09.11.2004, allowed the same by dated 22.12.2004. Aggrieved by the same, the plaintiff preferred a civil revision, which has since been allowed by the impugned , giving rise to the present appeal. 3. We have heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the material on record. 4. It is an admitted position that the suit is still pending before the Trial Court. The plaintiff has not been granted any declaration as such till date. The ex-parte decree having been set aside, there was no occasion for the plaintiff to further act upon the agreement dated 30.07.1991 since no rights had crystallized to the parties. The basis of that agreement was the ex-parte decree of declaration and injunction in favour of the plaintiff. Once the ex-parte decree has itself been set aside and the suit was to proceed further from the stage of filing of written statement by the Appellant- State, the agreement dated 604 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 30.07.1991 would lose all its credibility assuming there was any semblance of any right to enter into the agreement. The application filed by BMC under Section 89 CPC was also not maintainable based on the agreement of 30.07.1991. There appears to be some kind of collusion between BMC and the plaintiff. Whether or not there was any condition in the agreement dated 30.07.1991 for appointment of Arbitrator, the very basis of entering into the agreement having been set aside, the agreement itself could not have been relied upon by any of the parties. 5. The suit land admittedly was owned by the Appellant-State. Even if the State had allotted it to BMC for constructing a bus stand, BMC could not have dealt with it and treated it to be in the ownership or possession of the plaintiff by entering into the agreement dated 30.07.1991.
