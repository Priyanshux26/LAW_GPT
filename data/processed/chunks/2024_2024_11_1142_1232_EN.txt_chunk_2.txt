11(6) of the Act: Held: In the instant case, clause 26 of the aforesaid Distributorship Agreement stipulates that the arbitration shall be subject to UAE Arbitration and Conciliation rules – The aforesaid arbitration clause further designates only one place i.e., Dubai, UAE as the venue of arbitration – Since only one place has been designated in the arbitration clause, and such place has been categorically fixed inasmuch as there is no scope for the place designated as venue to change in terms of Clause 26, and furthermore, the said clause has explicitly stipulated that the curial law would be the UAE Arbitration and Conciliation rules and there being no other contrary indicia let alone a significant contrary indicia, this Court is of the considered opinion that the Dubai, UAE has not been designated merely as a venue but rather as the juridical seat of arbitration in terms of clause 26 of the Distributorship Agreement – And since the Distributorship Agreement already designates Dubai, UAE as the seat of arbitration, the same would be akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause with only the courts in Dubai, UAE having the jurisdiction over such arbitration – This Court, also will not have jurisdiction to entertain the present Section 11 petition because, Part I of this Act, 1996 will not be applicable where the seat of arbitration is outside India or where the law governing the arbitration agreement is not Indian laws – As the Distributorship Agreement, more particularly Clauses 26 & 27 respectively makes it abundantly clear that the seat of arbitration is in fact Dubai, UAE, furthermore both the law governing the contract and the curial law are not Indian laws – Even if it is assumed that Clause 27 of the aforesaid Distributorship Agreement conferred concurrent jurisdiction to both the courts in UAE and the other courts and thus, the petitioner herein was well-within its right to approach this Court in terms of the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause for the purpose of appointment of arbitrator, this Court can decline to exercise its jurisdiction if there exists a more appropriate forum – The more appropriate forum suitable for appointment of arbitrator is Dubai, UAE and not the courts of India – Thus, the present petition under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 is not maintainable as neither the seat of arbitration is 1146 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports India nor is the arbitration agreement governed by laws of India. [Paras 55, 56, 62, 63, 70, 72] Case Law Cited National Thermal Power Corporation v.
