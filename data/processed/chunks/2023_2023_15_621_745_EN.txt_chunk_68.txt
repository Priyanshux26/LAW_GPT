Conclusion ................................................................................43 PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J. A. Introduction 1. The reference to this Constitution Bench is for an authoritative determination of the applicability of the ‘Group of Companies doctrine’ to proceedings under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,1 and if found to be applicable and statutorily anchored, to delineate its precise contours. 2. In the reference , Chief Justice N.V. Ramana highlighted the variations in the exposition and application of the doctrine as it has evolved in India. He questioned the statutory source of the doctrine in the phrase “claiming through or under”, which appears in Sections 8 and 45 of the Act. He also cautioned that maintaining the separate legal identities of members within the same group of companies is a fundamental principle of corporate and contract law. In this light, the specifi c questions formulated and referred to this Constitution Bench by Chief Justice N.V. Ramana,2 are as follows: “(a) Whether phrase “claiming through or under” in Sections 8 and 113 could be interpreted to include “Group of Companies” doctrine? 1 Hereinafter referred to as the Act. 2 For himself and for Justice A.S. Bopanna. 3 The phrase “claiming through or under” does not appear in Section 11. Rather, the reference to Section 11 must be read as Section 45 that contains this phrase. *Ed.

LTD. & ANR. 717 [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J.] (b) Whether the “Group of Companies” doctrine as expounded by Chloro Controls case4 and subsequent s are valid in law?”5 3. Justice Surya Kant concurred with Chief Justice Ramana and supplemented his reasons for reference. At the outset, he emphasised the need to retain the doctrine in India to keep pace with the complexity of multi-party business transactions, where certain persons do not formally sign the contract but are involved in its negotiation and performance. Especially in India, with large number of family-run business groups, he expressed that the inclusion of the non-signatory company is essential for effective and complete dispute resolution through arbitration. However, he also indicated the need to iron out inconsistencies in the formulation of the doctrine. He questioned the reliance on equity considerations and ‘single economic reality’ to determine non-signatories to be parties, as these undermine well- entrenched principles of party autonomy and separate legal entity. In this light, for an authoritative determination of the contours of the doctrine, he framed the following questions: “(a) Whether the Group of Companies doctrine should be read into Section 8 of the Act or whether it can exist in Indian jurisprudence independent of any statutory provision?
