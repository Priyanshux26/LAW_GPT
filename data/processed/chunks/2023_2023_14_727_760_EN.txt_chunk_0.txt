OKA AND SANJAY KAROL, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: In a case primarily involving a dying declaration in addition to the ocular and circumstantial evidence, the Trial Court acquitted the appellants-accused along with other accused persons, whether the High Court was justifi ed in overturning the same in respect of the appellants. Evidence – Dying declaration – Reliance upon in addition to the ocular and circumstantial evidence – Legality: Held: The dying declaration, although undoubtedly a substantive piece of evidence upon which reliance can be placed, in the present facts is rendered nugatory as the person who took down such declaration was not examined, nor did the police offi cer (PW19) endorse the said document with details of who took down the declaration – Examination of the person who reduced into writing, the dying declaration, is essential – Particularly, in the absence of any explanation forthcoming for the production of evidence – Given the nature of a dying declaration, it is required that such statement be free from tutoring, prompting, or not be a product of imagination – But it has emanated from the statement of the Doctor, PW1, that at the time of the dying declaration being made, there were numerous people present near him – It is also not clear as to in front of which of the relatives of deceased was the same taken down – Further, the circumstantial evidence present on record also does not point to the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused persons – None of the eyewitnesses-PWs 2, 3, 15, as referred to by the trial court succeeded in attributing a particular role to any of the accused 727 728 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. persons and equally so, to the appellants, whose acquittals were overturned by the High Court – View taken by the Trial Court was a possible view and there being no error in appreciation of evidence as also application of law; the High Court without assigning any cogent reasons ought not to have interfered with such fi ndings – Impugned set aside – Acquittal restored – However, since the sentence awarded by the High Court u/s.304 Part II was for 4 years, and the application of exemption from surrender was disallowed by this Court in 2010, the Appellants appear to have already served the sentence awarded to them – Fine made payable by each of the accused, as a result of the impugned be refunded – Bail bonds discharged – Penal Code, 1860 – ss.143, 144, 146, 147, 148, 304 Part II, 324, 326, 447, 504 and 506 r/w s.149. [Paras 11.10, 20, 29.1-29.3, 30, 31] Evidence – Ocular evidence: Held: Ocular evidence fares better than other kinds of evidence and is considered evidence of a strong nature – The principle is that if the eyewitness testimony is “wholly reliable”, then the court can base conviction thereupon – This applies even in cases where there is a sole eyewitness – In the present case, the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are found to be unreliable, unworthy of credence – The testimonies diff er on essential material facts, such as the number of persons, how the accused came to lay where he did, when discovered etc.
