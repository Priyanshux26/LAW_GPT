The primary concern of the Board would be the revival of the sick company and to save the sick company from winding up. D That is why with a view to see that there is no impediment in framing the rehabilitation scheme and to get out the sick company from sickness. Section 22 provides for suspension of legal proceedings, contracts etc. On a bare reading of Section 22 and Section 22A of SICA, it appears that these two provisions primarily ensure that the scheme prepared by BIFR does not E get frustrated because of certain other legal proceedings and to prevent untimely and unwarranted disposal of the assets of the sick industrial company. These sections clearly state certain restrictions which will impact upon the implementation of the scheme as well as on the assets of the company.

SCR 747 – relied on. 1.2 Under Section 18 of the SICA, 1985, it is the operating agency to prepare a scheme with respect to the sick company providing for any one or more of the measures mentioned in H 1028 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A Section 18, which include:- (i) the financial reconstruction of the sick industrial company; (ii) such other preventive, ameliorative and remedial measures as may be appropriate. The operating agency is defined under Section 3(i) and it means any public financial institution, State-level institution, scheduled bank or any other person as may be specified by general or special as B its agency by the Board. No other persons including the unsecured creditors comes into picture like preparing the scheme under Section 18. Section 18 of the SICA does not provide that at the time of preparing of the scheme under Section 18 or when it is sanctioned by the Board, the unsecured creditors are required C to be heard. The only provision for the consent required is Section 19 and the agency/person, who is required to give the financial assistance, its consent is required. Once the rehabilitation scheme / scheme under Section 18 prepared by the operating agency is sanctioned by the BIFR, which may include the scaling down the value of dues of the unsecured creditors, the same shall bind all, D otherwise the rehabilitation scheme shall not be workable at all and the object and purpose of enactment of the SICA, 1985 will be frustrated. If some persons / unsecured creditors and/or even the labourers are permitted to get out of the purview of the scheme and thereafter permitting such or some of the unsecured creditors E to wait till the scheme for rehabilitation of the sick company has worked itself out, in that case, the scheme shall not be workable at all.
