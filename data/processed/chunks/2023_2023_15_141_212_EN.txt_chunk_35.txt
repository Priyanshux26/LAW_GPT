These demarcate the area over which the appropriate legislatures can operate. It is well settled that widest amplitude should be given to the language of the entries in three Lists but some of these entries in diff erent lists or in the same list may override and sometimes may appear to be in direct confl ict with each other, then and then only comes the duty of the court to fi nd the true intent and purpose and to examine the particular legislation in question. Each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be comprehended in it. ...” 87. Recently, Bimolangshu Roy (Dead) through L.Rs. v. State of Assam & Ors34 this court had held that: “23. Article 246 is one of the sources of authority to legislate under the Constitution of India. It declares that Parliament and the legislatures of the various states have the “power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated” in each of the three lists contained in the Seventh Schedule. It also makes clear that the power of the Parliament 33 1989 Supp (1)SCR 623 34 [2017] 13 SCR301 188 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. is exclusive with respect to List I and that of the State Legislature with respect to List II. List III indicates various fi elds over which both the Parliament as well as the State legislatures would have authority to legislate concurrently subject of course to the discipline of Article 254. 24. Apart from declaration contained in Article 246, there are various other Articles of the Constitution which confer authority to legislate either on the Parliament or on a State legislature, as the case may be in various circumstances. For example, Article 3 authorises the Parliament to make a law either creating a new State or extinguishing an existing State. Such a power is exclusively conferred on the Parliament. 25. Article 326 while declaring a right of every citizen who is not less than 18 years of age to register as a voter at any election to the House of the People or to the legislative assembly of a State, authorises the appropriate legislature to disqualify any such citizen to be a voter on any one of the grounds specifi ed Under Article 326 by making a law. The authority to make such a law obviously fl ows directly from the text of Article 326 but not from Article 246. See also Articles 2, 3, 11, 15(5), 22(7), 32(3), 33, 34, 59(3), 70, 71(3), 98(2). The Articles mentioned above are only illustrative but not exhaustive of the category. 26. It must be remembered that this Court repeatedly held that the entries in the various lists of the Seventh Schedule are not sources of the legislative power but are only indicative of the fi elds w.r.t. which the appropriate legislature is competent to legislate. 27. The task of this Court in identifying the scope of an entry in the Lists contained in the Seventh Schedule is not easy.
