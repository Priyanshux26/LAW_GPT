The NIACL in the affidavit set out as follows: “2. There are no written guidelines for computing depreciation @ 4% per year. However, there is established practice to calculate the depreciation in the case of old machinery @ 5% per year upto maximum of 75% - 80%. The Surveyors M/s. P.C. Gandhi and Associates assessed the claim of M/s. Transpek Industries Ltd. by computing the depreciation of 75%. In the case of M/s. Modem Denim Ltd. the Surveyor applied the depreciation of 50% for 10 years usage considering 20 years machine line. Copy of Surveyor’s letter dated 20th December, 2006 is Exhibit R-1. The copy of the Surveyor’s report dated 19th March 2003 with respect to M/s. Transpek Industries Ltd. is Exhibit R-2 hereto. The copy of the Surveyor report dated 25th February, 2003 with respect to Modem Denim Ltd. is Exhibit R-3 hereto.” 70. The surveyors had offered justification in their response dated 07.12.2002 for providing depreciation at the rate of 60%. The [2024] 5 S.C.R. 317 New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v. M/s Tata Steel Ltd. Additional Affidavit also clarifies the established practice. It should not be forgotten that the base figure of Rs.20.09 crores was kept intact. We set aside the finding of the NCDRC that the practice adopted in the instant case was not a healthy practice by the NIACL. We uphold the percentage of depreciation at 60%. We have not disturbed the base value of Rs.20.09 crores as no arguments on that score were advanced by the NIACL. 71. In view of the above discussion, the NIACL rightly ed the settlement of the claim on 03.01.2003 stating the loss amount as Rs.7.88 Crores and ing the balance amount of 2.88 crores be paid after adjusting the on account payment. Question No. (iii) - Applicability of the in Oswal Plastic Industries (supra) 72. The only other question that remains to be answered is the argument based on the in Oswal Plastic Industries (supra). Firstly, no factual foundation was placed to raise this submission. Even in the Civil Appeals of the Insured the only ground was based on the correct base figure and the applicable rates of depreciation. In fact, the Insured in ground (D) in Civil Appeal 5242-5243 of 2009 admitted that the NCDRC rightly proceeded to determine the compensation on depreciation basis. Ground (D) reads as follows: “Because the Hon’ble National Commission rightly proceeded on the premise that reinstatement of the machine is no longer possible and that the compensation to the appellant is therefore to be determined on depreciation basis, i.e., value of the machine on the date of loss.” 73. Further in the case of Oswal Plastic Industries (supra), as is clear from para 2 of the said , it appears the policy was on reinstatement value basis. The complainant there claimed that he had purchased the machinery to replace the damage in machinery at the cost of 1,34,07,836/-. However, the surveyor had assessed the loss on reinstatement basis 29,17,500/-.
