The lease in respect of Survey No. 291 was specifi cally executed for cultivation of sugarcane crop, whereas the lease for Survey No.290/1 & 290/2 were for cultivation, generally. 2. On the expiration of the tenure of the lease, a notice (dated 05.09.1975) for termination of tenancy (hereinafter referred to as ‘notice’) had been issued to the tenants. The landlord sought to recover possession for the purpose of personal cultivation. It was stated in the notice that the tenanted land was the principal source of income for the family and that their livelihood was dependent on the cultivation of such lands. It is critical to note at the very outset that the notice pertained to land bearing Survey No.291 only and no separate notice of termination of tenancy was issued in respect of land bearing Survey No. 290/1 & 290/2. 3. Since the tenant did not voluntarily relinquish his possession in response to the notice, the landlord initiated proceedings1 for resumption of tenanted lands before the Court of Tenancy Awal Karkun, Rahuri (hereinafter referred to as ‘original authority’) under Section 29 read with Section 43A(1) (b) of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 19482. (for short ‘the Act’). Through these proceedings, the landlord had sought to recover 1 Tenancy Case No. 2/1977 2 The Act has since been renamed as the Maharashtra Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 by Maharashtra Act 24 of 2012 KESHAV BHAURAO YEOLE (D) BY LRS. v.
