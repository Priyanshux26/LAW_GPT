Therefore, under the provisions of section 145 of Civil Procedure Code, the surety cannot be recovered by selling the said shop as it is vested ownership right of Municipal Corporation, Kanpur Metropolitan, Kanpur on C the said land of shop. The applicant no. 3 namely Abhishek Dixit is not owner of said land of shop. … … In accordance of principle established by the Bench of Hon’ble High Court in judicial citation/ i.e. Rajkumar Makheja& Others Versus M/s. S.K.S. & Company & Others, 2012 (3) A.R.C. D 117, now it cannot be granted/ extended the time limit to the revisionists for presenting surety at this stage as now, the limitation period of presenting the surety has been ceased. In this way, it is clear that applicants/ revisionists have completely not complied the provisions of section 17 of Provincial Small Cause Act.” E 10.
