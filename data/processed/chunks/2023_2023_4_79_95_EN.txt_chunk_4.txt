C 4. On being examined by the ASC although nothing came forward as to why in the absence of a competitive bidding, the solitary bid of the present appellants was processed, be that as it may, the bid of the appellants in reference to Unit Block IV for the captioned assets was accepted as it reveals from the communication dated 12th August, 2004 D with a rider that the same shall be confirmed as per the terms and conditions of ASC advised to all the bidders on 8th August, 2004 for which the bidder may be required to execute a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with IDBI. 5.

The appellants from the day one were reluctant in furnishing the bank guarantee of Rs.2,84,00,000/, however, shown their alleged willingness to pay the value of the assets in terms of the bid within a F period of six months.
