This again, is an irresponsible statement. 20. With respect to the other arguments made by the appellant before us, we are of the view that the High Court has elaborately dealt with the same and they require no interference or indulgence by us. 21. The appellant’s conduct before the High Court and for that matter, even before this Court, amounts to undermining the system of the law and interfering with the course of justice administration. The High Court observed a pattern in the behaviour of the appellant. He has had a habit of misbehaving with a Bench which is not agreeing with him. The misbehaviour goes to the extent of casting aspersions and threatening the Judges hearing the matters. 22. We are of the opinion that the High Court correctly rejected the apology. An apology must evidence remorse with respect to the contemptuous acts and is not to be used as a weapon to purge the guilty of their offence4. Further, an apology lacking in sincerity and not evidencing contriteness, cannot be accepted5. 4 M.Y. Shareef v. Hon’ble Judges of High Court of Nagpur, (1955) 1 SCR 757. 5 Omesh Saigal and State v. R.K. Dalmia, 1968 SCC OnLine Del 179 and L. D. Jaikwal v. State of U.P., 1984 ( 3 ) SCR 833 : (1984) 3 SCC 405. 1164 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 23. Having considered the impugned before us in detail and having perused the way the appellant has conducted the proceedings before this Court, and after giving our anxious consideration, we are of the opinion that the finding of conviction against the appellant warrants no interference. However, considering the age of the appellant and taking note of his submission that he is suffering from certain medical ailments, we modify the sentence imposed by the High Court from imprisonment for three months till the rising of the court. 24. The three other connected matters being (a) M.A. 256/2017 in Contempt Petition (C) No. 64/2007, (b) SLP (Crl.) No. 9689/2018, and (c) Diary No. 44408/2018 are not related to the present criminal appeal and, therefore, we de-tag them and direct them to be listed for hearing separately. 25. In view of the above, Criminal Appeal No. 577/2007 arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 1756 of 2007 against Final Common and dated 19.10.2006 passed by the High Court of Delhi in Criminal Contempt Cases Nos. 16 & 17 of 2006, is dismissed, subject to the above modification of the sentence till the rising of the Court. 26. Pending applications, if any, are disposed of. 27. No as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeal dismissed.
