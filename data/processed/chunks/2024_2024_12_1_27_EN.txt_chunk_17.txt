Merely because this Court in some of such decisions held that when a Magistrate conducted an inquiry under Section 202 Cr.P.C., and dismissed a complaint on merits, a second complaint on the same facts would not be maintainable unless there are very exceptional circumstances, it could not be understood that in all cases where a complaint to a Magistrate was not proceeded under Section 202 of the Cr.P.C., and dismissed not at the stage of Section 203, Cr.P.C., a second complaint or a second protest petition would be maintainable. The various decisions referred above in Samta Naidu’s case and recitals therefrom, extracted above would indubitably reveal the said position. The different situations where a second complaint or a second protest petition would be maintainable and would not be maintainable were specifically discussed and decided, in those decisions. In short, the 26 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports maintainability or otherwise of the second complaint would depend upon how the earlier complaint happened to be rejected/dismissed at the first instance. 32. In the context of the contentions, it is to be noted that the case at hand stands on a firmer footing than the case involved in Samta Naidu’s case (supra). Paragraph 16 of Samta Naidu’s case (supra), as extracted above,would reveal that the earlier complaint involved in that case was disposed of not on technical ground but on finding that no prima facie case was made out and in the second complaint the nature of the supporting materials were furnished and this Court observed that it could not be said that those materials furnished and relied upon in the second complaint could not have been procured earlier. Thereafter, finding that both the complaints were identical the finding of the High Court that the second complaint was maintainable was rejected and the subject complaint was dismissed as not being maintainable. In the case at hand, a perusal of protest petition dated 05.05.2011 and the second complaint dated 20.07.2011 would reveal that the second complaint filed after acceptance of final report filed pursuant to the investigation in the FIR registered based on the complaint dated 11.11.2010, that too after considering the narazi petition and hearing the complainant (the second respondent herein) the second complaint dated 20.07.2011 has been filed reproducing the first complaint dated 11.11.2010 and stating that the said complaint was not properly investigated and action should be taken on the second complaint dated 20.07.2011. In fact, the indubitable position is that the core of the original complaint dated 11.11.2010 and the second complaint dated 20.07.2011 is the same. 33. In the light of the decision in Ravinder Singh v. Sukhbir Singh,15 referred to in Samta Naidu’s case (supra) repeated complaints by frustrated litigants cannot be maintained. A scanning of the second complaint dated 20.07.2011 would reveal that none of the situations permissible in terms of the decisions referred supra exist in the case at hand to maintain the said complaint. When that be the position, the learned Sessions Judge as also the High Court were not justified in interfering with the passed by the learned CJM 15 [2013] 1 SCR 243 : (2013) 9 SCC 245 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
