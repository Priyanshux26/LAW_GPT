In I.R. Coelho, in the context of Article 31-B, a bench of nine judges of this Court held that even constitutional amendments by which laws are inserted in the ninth schedule are amenable to a basic structure challenge. This Court further held that the essence of Articles 21, 14 and 19 is a part of this basic structure and amendments inserting laws in the ninth schedule can be tested on this anvil. According to the appellants, in view of this judgement,it is difficult to envisage a situation where Articles 14 and 19 can be abrogated by a mere legislation under the protection of Article 31-C without even requiring a constitutional amendment. As noted during the course of the hearing, such arguments essentially involve a challenge to the constitutionality of Article 31-C itself, which falls outside the ambit of this judgement and has already been settled by a thirteen-judge bench of this Court in Kesavananda Bharati. We are not inclined to address these arguments. However, parties are at liberty to raise arguments relying on IR Coehlo to advance their submissions on the constitutionality of the MHADA Act before the regular bench. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 99 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. b. Submissions of the Respondents and Intervenors 79. Mr R Venkataramani, the learned Attorney General appearing on behalf of the respondents, contested the interpretation of Article 39(b) advanced by the appellants and advocated for a wider reading of the provision. He submitted: a. Given the constitutional context of Article 39(b) and its relevance towards realising an egalitarian social , any narrow reading of the provision would offend the free play that is desirable in the working of the provision; b. Nothing in Article 39 suggests any limitation of the words used therein. The distinction between public and private resources, or natural and human-made resources is alien to the spirit of Article 39 (b) and (c); and c. A wide range of resources have been considered as part of the phrase ‘material resources of the community’ and within the ambit of Article 39(b). These include housing,76 contract carriages,77 land,78 coke oven plants,79 assets of sick textile undertakings,80 drugs,81 electricity,82 capital,83 licenses for felling bamboo,84 refractory plants,85 grant of dealerships of petroleum products,86 mines and minerals,87 mining lease,88 refund of excise,89 natural gas90 and the grant of natural resource.91 76 B Banerjee v Anita Pan (1975) 1 SCC 166 : 1974 INSC 246 77 State of Karnataka & Anr v.
