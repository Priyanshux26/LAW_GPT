It was observed as follows: ‘4. …We, therefore, hold that before a person can be liable for prosecution or conviction under Section 27(a)(i)(ii) read D with Section 18(c) of the Act, it must be proved by the prosecution affirmatively that he was manufacturing the drugs for sale or was selling the same or had stocked them or exhibited the articles for sale. The possession simpliciter of the articles does not appear to be punishable under any of the provisions of the Act. If, therefore, the essential ingredients E of Section 27 are not satisfied the plea of guilty cannot lead the Court to convict the appellant.’ 16. The sanctioning authority had not examined at all whether a practising doctor could be prosecuted under the facts of the case, considering the small quantity of the drugs and the exception created in F favour of medical practitioner under Rule 123, read with the Schedule “K”. All these factors ought to have been considered by the sanctioning authority. Under these circumstances we allow this appeal and set aside the of the learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court and quash the criminal proceedings in Criminal Case No. 7315 of 2018 on G the file of X Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai. Divya Pandey Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Adiraj Bali and Shevali Monga, LCRAs) 3 (1979) 1 SCC 568 H
