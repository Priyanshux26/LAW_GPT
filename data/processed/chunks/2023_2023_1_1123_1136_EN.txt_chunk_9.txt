Keeping in view the applicable understanding of the element of ‘portable’ as understood in common parlance used in the trade of ADPs, we must hold that the Concerned Goods are not portable for the reasons that- Firstly, the diagonal dimension of the Concerned Goods being minimum of the length of 18.5 inches and the same needs to be transported along with the power cable as well as the applicable stand in E most cases if it is to be mounted and; secondly there being no protective case designed by the markets for daily transport for these Concerned Goods. Such requirements make the Concerned Goods unable to be carried around easily during daily transit. We, thus, hold that the Concerned Goods are not ‘portable’. F 23. It goes without saying that since the customs authorities wanted to classify the goods differently, the burden of proof to showcase the same was on them, which they failed to discharge.13 Hence under the prevalent self-assessment procedure, the classification submitted by the Appellants must be accepted.
