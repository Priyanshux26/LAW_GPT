Thajudeen v. Tamil Nadu Khadi and Village Industries Board as vacant may be a disobedience of the object of the gift but that by itself would not attract the power to revoke the gift deed – No stipulation in the gift deed that if the suit property is not so utilised, the gift would stand revoked or would be revoked at the discretion of the donor – As regards, the suit filed by the respondent being hit by limitation, once it is held that the gift deed was validly executed resulting in the absolute transfer of title in favour of the respondent, the same is not liable to be revoked, and as such the revocation deed is meaningless especially for the purposes of calculating the period of limitation for instituting the suit – Suit is not simply for the declaration of title rather it is for a further relief for recovery of possession – When in a suit for declaration of title, a further relief is claimed, the relief of declaration would only be an ancillary one and for the purposes of limitation, it would be governed by the relief that has been additionally claimed – Though the limitation for filing a suit for declaration of title is three years as per Art.58 but for recovery of possession based upon title, the limitation is 12 years from the date the possession of the defendant becomes adverse in terms of Art.65 – Thus, the suit for the relief of possession was not actually barred and the court of first instance could not have dismissed the entire suit as barred by time – No error or illegality on part of the first appellate court and the High Court in decreeing the suit of the respondent – Transfer of Property Act, 1882 – Limitation Act, 1963 – Arts.58, 65.
