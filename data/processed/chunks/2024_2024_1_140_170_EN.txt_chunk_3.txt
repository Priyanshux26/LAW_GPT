The present appeals raise an interesting question on the right to claim set-off in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process, when the Resolution Professional proceeds in terms of clause (a) to sub-section (2) of Section 25 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 20161 to take custody and control of all the assets of the corporate debtor. 2. In to decide the issue raised in these appeals, we are required to refer to the facts in brief: 2.1 In April 2016, Bharti Airtel Limited and Bharti Hexacom Limited2 entered into eight spectrum trading agreements with Aircel Limited and Dishnet Wireless Limited3 for purchase of the right to use the spectrum allocated to the latter in the 2300 MHz band. The agreement was contingent on approval of the Department of Telecommunications4, Government of India. The DoT for grant of approval demanded bank guarantees in relation to certain licence dues and spectrum usage dues from the Aircel entities. Challenging this direction, the Aircel entities 1 For short, ‘IBC’. 2 For short- ‘The appellants’ or ‘Airtel entities’. 3 For short- ‘Aircel entities’. 4 For short- ‘DoT’. 146 [2024] 1 S.C.R. DIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS approached the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal5. By the interim dated 3rd June 2016, TDSAT directed Aircel entities to submit the bank guarantees. As the Aircel entities did not have the means to procure and submit the bank guarantees for approximately Rs.453.73 crores, they approached the Airtel entities to submit bank guarantees on their behalf to the DoT. 2.2 In terms of the eight spectrum transfer agreements, the Airtel Entities were to pay Rs.4,022.75 crores to the Aircel entities. The Airtel entities and Aircel entities entered into three Letters of Understanding whereby the Airtel entities agreed to furnish the bank guarantees to the DOT on behalf of the Aircel entities.
