However, no such proceedings were thereafter initiated by the State. 4.2 The High Court further observed that the State sought to set up title to the subject land based on the concept of escheat without invoking the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Escheats and Bona Vacantia Act, 1974. This led to admonition of the State authorities for taking mutually inconsistent pleas of ‘absolute title’ and ‘right by escheat’. 4.3 The State was further held to have suppressed material information and approached the Court with unclean hands inasmuch as the stand taken by them was not supported by any documentary evidence. 13 R.P. (C) 3973/2018 14 Division Bench (review), hereafter 1088 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 4.4 The State, on its part, had argued that the contempt action was itself barred by limitation, as per section 20 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 197115 read with rule 21 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court Writ Proceedings Rules, 1977.16 Such argument was rejected by the Division Bench (review) by relying on the decision in Pallav Seth v. Custodian,17 wherein it was held that the period of limitation would only commence upon the date from the discovery of fraud played by the party on the Court/opposite party; the State having acted fraudulently by suppressing information, the contempt petition would not be barred by limitation. 4.5 With respect to the contempt alleged, the Division Bench (review) examined the conduct of the State in remaining silent on the matter of mutation and held that such silence could not be interpreted to be a refusal on the part of the State to act upon the representations. In view thereof, coupled with the State’s periodic representations made before the Court that they would implement the direction for mutation, it was held that such acts constituted a continuing wrong so as to ensconce the contempt petition within the ambit of the period of limitation. 4.6 In such review proceedings, the first respondent had brought on record additional documents in the nature of sale deeds, s by revenue authorities and governmental memos, to which allegedly access was obtained only after the disposal of the contempt appeal, to argue that the subject land was the self-acquired private property of the first respondent’s predecessor-in-interest. The Division Bench (review) undertook a detailed examination of the same to definitively conclude, with the aid of section 79 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, that the property belonged to the predecessor-in-interest of the first respondent. The State’s objection to such documents was overruled as the same were held to come within the purview of “new and important matter or evidence” as provided in XLVII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.18 15 the Act, hereafter 16 the Writ Rules, hereafter 17 [2001] Supp. 1 SCR 387 : (2001) 7 SCC 549 18 CPC, hereafter [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1089 S. Tirupathi Rao v. M. Lingamaiah & Ors. 4.7 In summation, the Division Bench (review) reviewed and reversed the and dated 16th August, 2018 and confirmed the dated 04th October, 2017 of the Single Judge passed on the writ petition.
