[Paras 201-208] Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023 – Scope and object of – Problematic provisions: Held: Model Act is a comprehensive document which covers all relevant aspects of prison management-security, safety, scientific and technological interventions, segregation of prisoners, special provision for women inmates, taking appropriate action against criminal activities of prisoners in the prison, grant of parole and furlough to prisoners, their education, vocational training and skill development, etc – It is for the respective State Governments to make use of the guidance provided in the Act of 2023 and 504 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports enact a suitable legislation on Prisons in their jurisdictions for bringing improvement in prison management and administration of prisoners – Model Act does not contain reference to prohibition of caste-based discrimination – Provision to that effect should be inserted in the Model Act – It should ban segregation or division of work based on caste – Definition of “Habitual Offender” u/s. 2(12) that habitual Offender means a prisoner who is committed to prison repeatedly for a crime also problematic – Phrase “committed to prison repeatedly” vague and over-broad – It can be used to declare anyone as a habitual offender, even if they have not been convicted for a crime – Model Act also provides that “habitual offenders” may be housed in a high security prison – In addition thereto the Act creates a category of “recidivist”, which means “any prisoner who is convicted for a crime more than once” – “Habitual/recidivist prisoners” may be classified separately and segregated in prisons – Also, Chapter IX dealing with “Protection of Society from Criminal Activities of High-Risk Prisoners, Habitual Offenders and Hardened Criminals”, seems to be over-board.
