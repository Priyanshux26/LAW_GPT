The recruitment process initiated on 23.12.2020 cannot continue indefinitely. The 2020 recruitment process had concluded and the fresh recruitment process commenced thereafter vide notification dated 29.09.2022. It would therefore not be appropriate for this Court to direct appointments to be made against the remaining 3929 vacancies, from the already-expired Merit List. 28. Dr. Menaka Guruswamy, learned senior counsel, placed heavy reliance on the ratio in Dinesh Kumar Kashyap & Ors. v. South East Central Railway & Ors.5 to contend that although the selected candidate may not have any vested right to be appointed against the available vacancies but when the employer decides not to fill up the posts, the discretion is to be exercised judiciously. On this aspect, suffice it would be to say that the Rules provided for shelf life of one year for the panel list. Admittedly, extension of the said list (notified on 15.02.2021) was not granted by any authority. As the decision to not act upon the expired select list is based upon the provisions of the Rules, we are disinclined to accept the argument advanced by the learned senior counsel based on the ratio in Dinesh Kumar Kashyap. It may also be noted that the candidates in Dinesh Kumar Kashyap (supra) had approached the Court during the validity of the select list unlike in these matters where the first batch of Writ Petitions came to be filed in May 2022, i.e., roughly three months after the expiry of the said Merit List in February 2022. 29. In light of the above discussion, the following conclusions are reached: i. The manner of shortlisting candidates for appointment as suggested by the Division Bench in the impugned s is inconsistent with the procedure laid down under Rule 8 of the Recruitment Rules, 2016, and those, cannot be sustained. ii. The Panel or Merit List as notified on 15.02.2021 stood extinguished after expiry of one year i.e., on 15.02.2022, as per Rule 12 of the Recruitment Rules, 2016. 5 [2018] 14 SCR 947 : (2019) 12 SCC 798 948 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports iii. No extension by any competent authority was granted to the 15.02.2021 Panel and therefore no relief can be granted to candidates who approached the court in May 2022, i.e., long after the panel stood extinguished. iv. No further appointments is permissible from the recruitment process initiated on 23.12.2020 when a fresh recruitment process has commenced. 30. The impugned rendered by the Division Bench on 11.11.2022 and the earlier direction given by the learned Single Judge on 26.09.2022 are accordingly set aside. The concerned 252 Writ Petitioners and others who are sailing with this group, do not have any legitimate claim for appointments, to the remaining vacancies in the form of the 23.12.2020 recruitment process. The appeals stand allowed accordingly. 31. The IA No. 28252 of 2024 and IA No. 28255 of 2024 are allowed to the extent of the prayers made by the applicant(s). All pending application(s), if any, including impleadment or intervention application(s), shall stand disposed of.
