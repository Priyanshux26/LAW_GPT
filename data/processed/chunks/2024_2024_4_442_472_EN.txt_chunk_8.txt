Sub-section (2) of Section 41 refers to issuance of authorisation for similar purposes by the officers of the Departments of Central Excise, Narcotics, Customs, Revenue Intelligence, etc. Sub-section (1) of Section 42 of the NDPS Act lays down that the empowered officer if he has a prior information given by any person, should necessarily take it down in writing, and where he has reason to believe from his personal knowledge, that offences under Chapter IV have been committed or that materials which may furnish evidence of commission of such offences are concealed in any building, etc. he may carry out the arrest or search, without warrant between sunrise and sunset and he may do so without recording his reasons of belie. The two separate procedures noticed above are exclusive of one another. Compliance with one, would not infer compliance with the other. In the circumstances contemplated under Section 42 of the NDPS Act the mandate of the procedure contemplated therein will have to be followed separately, in the manner interpreted by this Court in Karnail Singh case [Karnail Singh v. State of Haryana, (2009) 8 SCC 539 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 887] and the same will not be assumed, merely because the Station House Officer concerned had registered a first information report, which was also dispatched to the Superintendent of Police, in compliance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.” 18. The aforesaid reference places its reliance on a of the Constitution Bench of this Court, i.e., Karnail Singh v. State of 454 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Haryana (2009) 8 SCC 539 which is also relied upon by the learned Counsel for the appellants. It is a well celebrated on the statutory requirement of writing down and conveying information to the superior officer prior to entry, search and seizure as per Section 42(1) and (2) of the NDPS Act 1985, requiring a literal or substantial compliance. The learned Counsel has brought our attention to paragraph number 35 of the at page 554 which dealt with effect of the decisions in Abdul Rashid Ibrahim Mansuri v. State of Gujarat (2000) 2 SCC 513 and that in Sajan Abraham v. State of Kerala (2001) 6 SCC 692. By virtue of this, it was observed that while a total non-compliance of Section 42 of the NDPS Act 1985 would be impermissible, a delayed compliance with satisfactory explanation about the said delay could be an acceptable compliance of statutory requirements under Sections 42(1) and (2). For a better clarity of the , paragraph number 35 is reproduced as follows: “35. In conclusion, what is to be noticed is that Abdul Rashid [(2000) 2 SCC 513 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 496] did not require literal compliance with the requirements of Sections 42(1) and 42(2) nor did Sajan Abraham [(2001) 6 SCC 692 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 1217] hold that the requirements of Sections 42(1) and 42(2) need not be fulfilled at all. The effect of the two decisions was as follows: (a) The officer on receiving the information [of the nature referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 42] from any person had to record it in writing in the register concerned and forthwith send a copy to his immediate official superior, before proceeding to take action in terms of clauses (a) to (d) of Section 42(1).
