M.P. No. 174, 106 and 140 of 2009 respectively seeking discharge from the charges. However, the Sessions Judge, vide dated 15.07.2009, dismissed all these petitions while observing that after considering the broad probabilities of the case, total facts of the evidence and documents produced before the court, the Petitioners therein (A2, A4 and A6) were not entitled for discharge. 5.9 Aggrieved by the dated 15.07.2009, A2, A5 and A6 filed Revision Petition being Crl. R.C. No. 1402 of 2009 before the High Court along with Crl. M.P. No. 1928 of 2009 seeking stay of all further proceedings. 5.10 The High Court, vide the impugned allowed the Crl. R.C. No. 1402 of 2009 and set aside the dated 15.07.2009 passed by the VII Addl. District and Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court), Vijayawada and accordingly allowed the Crl. M.P. No. 174, 106 and 140 of 2009, effectively discharging the accused- respondents from the charges. The High Court held that the earlier investigations conducted by the officials of CID, RCIU, Vijayawada and re-confirmed by the CBI clinchingly establish that the occurrence took place in exercise of right of self-defence, and thus revision stood allowed. 5.11 Aggrieved by the impugned passed by the High Court, the complainant-appellant is before us. 5.12 We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record. 1698 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 5.13 The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the impugned has been passed erroneously and the High Court ought to have considered that at the time of framing the charges, no meticulous scrutiny is required and a strong suspicion of commission of offence alone is sufficient. It was contended that both the Courts below the High Court had found that there is a prima facie case against A2 and A4 to A6 after appreciating all the witnesses and documents thoroughly, therefore the case deserved to be tried and should not have been quashed at the outset, especially when the charges are such grave in nature. Since, the High Court in the impugned had observed that there were no eye-witnesses to the case, it was also submitted by the appellant that one cannot expect the direct witnesses to the occurrence which took place at midnight in the outskirts of the city and such a ground alone did not warrant discharge of the accused-respondents altogether. There were also multiple loopholes pointed out by the appellant in the story put forth by the police officials, which we find unnecessary to delve into at this stage. 5.14 However, before moving to the arguments submitted by the respondents, we find it pertinent to produce the version of events put forth by the respondent-police officials leading to the alleged encounter. It was alleged that while the police officials were interrogating V. Durga Prasad in the Machavaram Police Station on 05.06.2002, he was taken out from the police lock-up for answering nature’s call at around 04.30 a.m. and he escaped from the police station by pushing Sentry Police Constable on duty aside.
