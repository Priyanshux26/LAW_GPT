Background 1. “Intoxicating liquor” falls within the legislative domain of the State Legislatures under Entry 8 of the State list, List II, of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The issues which arise for adjudication in this reference pertain to the scope of the power of the State Legislatures under Entry 8 and the meaning of the phrase “intoxicating liquor”. The question is whether “intoxicating liquor” in Entry 8 only includes potable alcohol, such as alcoholic beverages or also includes alcohol which is used in the production of other products. In Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of UP,1 (“Synthetics [7J]), a seven-Judge Bench delineated the scope of the regulatory powers of State Legislatures on “intoxicating liquor”. The correctness of Synthetics [7J] (supra) has been referred to a larger bench. We answer the reference in this . i. Constitutional provisions 2.
