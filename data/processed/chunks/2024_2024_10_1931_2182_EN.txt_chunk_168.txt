Here, the conflict arises between action that could be taken by the Central Government under Section 18G of IDRA made by virtue of Entry 52 – List I as opposed to a State law or action which could be made under Entry 33(a) – List III. In such case, the doctrine of repugnancy would arise as per the first part of Article 254(1) between Entry 52 – List I and Entry 33(a) – List III and not in respect of the second part of Article 254(1). Thus, when the Central Government seeks to exercise power in respect of a scheduled industry under Section 18G of the IDRA it is pursuant to the said Act being made under Entry 52 – List I. Hence, any action to be taken by the Central Government under Section 18G is not really an action that would be taken under Entry 33(a) – List III. 18.1 On this aspect, reference must be made to of this Court in State of Kerala vs. Mar Appraem Kuri Company Limited (2012) 7 SCC 106 (“Mar Appraem Kuri Company”). The Constitution Bench of this Court speaking through Kapadia, C.J., considered the question - when does repugnancy arise in the context of whether Kerala Chitties Act 23 of 1975 becoming repugnant to the (Central) Chit Funds Act 40 of 1982 under Article 254(1) upon making of the Central Act (i.e. 19.08.1982 when the President gave his assent) or whether the Kerala Chitties Act 23 of 1975 would become repugnant to the Central Act as and when the notification under Section 1(3) of the Central Act bringing the Central Act into force in the State of Kerala is issued. In other words, the question raised was whether making of the law or its commencement brings about repugnancy or inconsistency as envisaged in Article 254(1) of [2024] 10 S.C.R. 2161 State of U.P. & Ors. v. M/s Lalta Prasad Vaish and sons the Constitution. In this context, reference was made to Deep Chand vs. State of UP, AIR 1959 SC 648 (“Deep Chand”) and it was observed as under: “30. That, in Deep Chand v. State of U.P., three principles were laid down as indicative of repugnancy between a State law and a Central law, which have to be borne in mind by the State Legislature whenever it seeks to enact a law under any entry in the Concurrent List. Thus, where there is a Central law which intends to override a State law or where there is a Central law intending to occupy the field hitherto occupied by the State law or where the Central law collides with the State law in actual terms, then the State Legislature would have to take into account the possibility of repugnancy within the meaning of Article 254 of the Constitution. In this connection, it was submitted that Tests 1 and 2 enumerated in Deep Chand do not require the Central law to be actually brought into force for repugnancy between two competing legislations to arise in the context of Article 254 of the Constitution.” 18.2 In paragraph 40, it was observed that the expression “subject to” in clauses (2) and (3) of Article 246 denotes supremacy of Parliament and the same is extracted as under: “40.
