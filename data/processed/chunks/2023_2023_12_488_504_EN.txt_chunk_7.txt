Reference be made to Govindbhai Chhotabhai Patel v. Patel Ramanbhai Mathurbhai.22 This Court in Kondiba Dagadu Kadam v. Savitribai Sopan Gujar23, observed- “6. If the question of law termed as a substantial question stands already decided by a larger Bench of the High Court concerned or by the Privy Council or by the Federal Court or by the Supreme Court, its merely wrong application on the facts of the case would not be termed to be a substantial question of law. Where a point of law has not been pleaded or is found to be arising between the parties in the absence of any factual format, a litigant should not be allowed to raise that question as a substantial question of law in second appeal. The mere appreciation of the facts, the documentary evidence or the meaning of entries and the contents of the document cannot be held to be raising a substantial question of law…” 21 (2007) 15 SCC 387 Two Judge Bench 22 (2020) 16 SCC 255 Two Judge Bench 23 (1999) 3 SCC 722 Two Judge Bench 500 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 16.5 Interference on fi ndings of fact permitted in exceptional cases, i.e., when fi nding is based on either inadmissible or, no evidence. This Court in Dinesh Kumar v. Yusuf Ali24 referring to various other cases held:- a) It is not permissible for High Court to reappreciate evidence as if it was the fi rst appellate court unless fi ndings were perverse. b) Finding of fact can be interfered in exceptional circumstances as rarity, rather than a regularity. c) Scrutiny of evidence in second appeal is not prohibited but has to be exercised upon proper circumspection. 17. Jurisdiction under second appeal not to be exercised merely because an alternate view is possible. It was observed in Hamida v. Mohd. Khalil25 7. …The High Court, it is well settled, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 100 CPC, cannot reverse the fi ndings of the lower appellate court on facts merely on the ground that on the facts found by the lower appellate court another view was possible.” This position was reiterated by Avtar Singh & Ors. v. Bimla Devi & Ors.26 17.1 In aid of such a restricted application, an essential aspect in ensuring that it does not acquire the nature of a “third appeal” is the limited possibility of appreciation of evidence and connectedly, the restriction on upturning concurrent fi ndings of fact. However, there are certain exceptions to the rule as pointed out by this Court in Nazir Mohamed v. J. Kamala27, as under: “33.4. The general rule is, that the High Court will not interfere with the concurrent fi ndings of the courts below. But it is not an absolute rule. Some of the well-recognised exceptions are where: (i) the courts below have ignored material evidence or acted on no evidence; (ii) the courts have drawn wrong inferences from proved facts by applying 24 (2010) 12 SCC 740 Two Judge Bench 25 (2001) 5 SCC 30 Two Judge Bench 26 (2021) 13 SCC 816 Two Judge Bench 27 (2020) 19 SCC 57 Two Judge Bench SURESH LATARUJI RAMTEKE v.
