[Paras 41, 42, 44] Doctrine/Principles — Doctrine of proportionality — Application of proportionality test to Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018 - Necessity prong: Held: (Per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) As per the Electoral Trust Scheme, contributions could be made by a person or body corporate to the trust which would transfer the amount to the political party — Trust is thus, treated as the contributor to the political party and guidelines were issued by the ECI to ensure transparency and openness in the electoral process - When the necessity test is applied, the Trust Scheme achieves the objective of the Union of India in a real and substantial manner anc is also a less restrictive alternate measure in view of the disclosure requirements, viz. the right to know of voters — Trust Scheme is in force and is a result of the legislative process — In a comparison of limited alternatives, it is a measure that best realises the objective of the Union of India in a real and substantial manner without significantly impacting the fundamental right of the voter to know. [Paras 50-51] Doctrine/Principles — Doctrine of proportionality — Application of proportionality test to Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018 — Fourth prong-the balancing prong of proportionality: [2024] 2 S.C.R. 433 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. Held: (Per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) On application of the balancing prong of proportionality, the Electoral Bond Scheme falls foul and negates and overwhelmingly disavows and annuls the voters right in an electoral process as neither the right of privacy nor the purpose of incentivising donations to political parties through banking channels, justify the infringement of the right to voters — Voters right to know and access to information is far too important in a democratic set-up so as to curtail and deny ‘essential’ information on the pretext of privacy and the desire to check the flow of unaccounted money to the political parties — While secret ballots are integral to fostering free and fair elections, transparency-not secrecy-in funding of political parties is a prerequisite for free and fair elections — Confidentiality of the voting booth does not extend to the anonymity in contributions to political parties. [Para 57] Constitution of India — Balancing of conflicting fundamental rights-right to information and the right to informational privacy — Standard to be followed: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, ७३.) (for himself and for B R Gavai, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, JJ) First exercise that the Court must undertake while balancing two fundamental rights is to determine if the Constitution creates a hierarchy between the two rights in conflict, if yes, then the right which has been granted a higher status would prevail over the other right involved — And if not, the following standard must be employed from the perspective of both the rights where rights A and B are in conflict, whether the measure is a suitable means for furthering right A and right B, whether the measure is least restrictive and equally effective to realise right A and right B, and whether the measure has a disproportionate impact on right A and right B — Courts have used the collective interest or the public interest standard, the single proportionality standard, and the double proportionality standard to balance the competing interests of fundamental rights — There is no constitutional hierarchy between the right to information and the right to informational privacy of political affiliation.
