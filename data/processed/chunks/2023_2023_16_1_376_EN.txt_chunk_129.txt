IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 185 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 301. Prior to the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution in 1956, Article 1(1) provided that India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States. Article 1(2) stipulated that the States and its territories would be those specifi ed in Parts A, B and C of the First Schedule. Article 1(3) had originally provided that the territory of India shall comprise of: a. the territories of the States; b. the territories specifi ed in Part D of the First Schedule; and c. such other territories as may be acquired. 302. With the Seventh Amendment in 1956, Article 1(2) was substituted to provide that the States and the territories shall be as specified in the First Schedule. Clause (3) was amended so as to substitute the Union Territories specifi ed in the First Schedule. With the creation of new States, their special needs were comprehended, as we have seen, with the insertion of special provisions in relation to those States. Some of the temporary and transitional provisions which were made at the adoption of the Constitution were repealed, as we have seen above, as the new institutions of government under democratically elected constitutional functionaries and legislatures took eff ect after the adoption of the Constitution. In understanding the provisions of Article 370 which is also comprised in Part XXI, a contextual analysis, as we have carried out above, would shed some light over the nature of the provisions comprised in the Part. 303. The marginal note to Article 370 was titled “Temporary provisions with respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir”. As we have already seen at the adoption of the Constitution, Part XXI in which Article 370 was situated dealt with ‘temporary’ and ‘transitional’ provisions. Whether a marginal note to a statutory provision can be utilised as an aid to interpretation is analysed in Justice G P Singh’s “Principles of Statutory Interpretation239”. According to the Treatise: “Although opinion is not uniform the weight of authority is in favour of the view that the marginal note appended to a section cannot be 239 14th Edition, Pages 188-189 186 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R.
