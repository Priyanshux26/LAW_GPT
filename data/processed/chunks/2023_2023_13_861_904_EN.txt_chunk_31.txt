This may arguably lead to absurd conclusions for entities which have legitimately taken over the debt of related parties, or where the related party entity had stopped being a “related party” long ago. 9 (2021) 3 SCC 475 10 (2019) 2 SCC 1 904 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 49. Arun Kumar Jagatramka Versus Jindal Steel and Power Limited and Another11, also deals with Section 29A of the Code. In that case, this Court observed that the fundamental postulate of the Code is that a corporate debtor has to be protected from its management and corporate debt. Hence it would be anomalous if a compromise or arrangement can be entertained from a person who is responsible for the state of aff airs of the corporate debtor. Referring to Arcelor Mittal (India) (P) Ltd. (supra), this Court observed that the said decision adverted to Section 29A of the Code as a typical instance of a see-through provision so that one is able to arrive at persons who are actually in ‘control’ whether jointly or in concert with other persons. It was thereafter that this Court held that Section 29A is a crucial link in ensuring that the objects of the Code are not defeated by allowing ‘ineligible persons’ responsible for running a company (corporate debtor) aground, to return in the new avatar of a resolution applicant. 50. From the above, it is clearly manifest that the disqualifi cation sought to be attached to the appellant is without any substance as the related party had ceased to be in the helm of aff airs of the corporate debtor more than a decade ago. He was not in charge of the company or an infl uential member of the company i.e., the corporate debtor when the appellant had made its bid pursuant to the auction sale notice. 51. Thus having regard to the aforesaid discussion, we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that Appellate Tribunal was not justified in setting aside the of the Tribunal dated 12.08.2021. Consequently, we set aside the dated 30.11.2021 passed by the Appellate Tribunal and restore the dated 12.08.2021. The appeal is accordingly allowed. However, there shall be no as to costs.
