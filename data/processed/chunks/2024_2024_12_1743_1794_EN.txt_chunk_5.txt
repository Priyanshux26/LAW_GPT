The High Court noted the contention that there was huge recovery of heroin made by ATS Gujarat as well as STS Punjab in FIR No.20/2020 and FIR No.23/2020, and therefore, the link between the petitioner herein to the said recovery of heroin effected in Gujarat or with the drug cartel allegedly in operation, had to be investigated.
