(2) The limitations on granting of bail specified in clause (b) of sub-section (1) are in addition to the limitations under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or any other law for the time being in force, or granting of bail.” E 11. In this case, as it stands, the appellant has been in custody since 03.10.2015, barring grant of interim bail from time to time, for wedding ceremonies7 and to take care of his ailing mother8. It was observed by this court, in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Kajad9 while commenting on Section 37 of the NDPS Act, that a “liberal” approach F should not be adopted: “Negation of bail is the rule and its grant and exception under sub clause (ii) of clause (b) of Section 37(1). For granting the bail the court must, on the basis of the record produced before it, be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for G believing that the accused is not guilty of the offences with 7 dated 03.05.2016 by the Special Judge; and dated 28.01.2022 by the Special Judge. 8 dated 24.07.2020 in Bail Application No. 1859/2020. 9 [2001] Supp. 2 SCR 617: (2001) 7 SCC 673. H 706 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A which he is charged and further that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. It has further to be noticed that the conditions for granting the bail, specified in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 37 are in addition to the limitations provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law for the time being in force regulating the grant of bail.” B 12. This court has to, therefore, consider the appellant’s claim for bail, within the framework of the NDPS Act, especially Section 37. In Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee (Representing Undertrial Prisoners) v. Union of India10, this court made certain crucial observations, which have a bearing on the present case while dealing C with denial of bail to those accused of offences under the NDPS Act: “On account of the strict language of the said provision very few persons accused of certain offences under the Act could secure bail. Now to refuse bail on the one hand and to delay trial of cases on the other is clearly unfair and unreasonable D and contrary to the spirit of Section 36(1) of the Act, Section 309 of the Code and Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. We are conscious of the statutory provision finding place in Section 37 of the Act prescribing the conditions which have to be satisfied before a person accused of an offence under E the Act can be released. Indeed we have adverted to this section in the earlier part of the . We have also kept in mind the interpretation placed on a similar provision in Section 20 of the TADA Act by the Constitution Bench in Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab [(1994) 3 SCC 569]. Despite this provision, we have directed as above mainly at F the call of Article 21 as the right to speedy trial may even require in some cases quashing of a criminal proceeding altogether, as held by a Constitution Bench of this Court in A.R.
