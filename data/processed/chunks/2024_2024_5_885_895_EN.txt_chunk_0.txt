[2024] 5 S.C.R. 885 : 2024 INSC 374 Kanihya @ Kanhi (Dead) Through LRS. v. Sukhi Ram & Ors. (Civil Appeal No. 3990 of 2011) 03 May 2024 [Rajesh Bindal* and Prasanna Bhalachandra Varale, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the High Court erred in not exercising the discretion to extend the time for deposit under Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in a pre-emption suit. Headnotes† Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Extension of time for deposit in pre-emption suit – The court can allow such an extension when there is a bona fide mistake and the deficiency is minor – law laid down in Johri Singh v. Sukh Pal Singh and Others, [1989] Supp. 1 SCR 17 – Followed – Non-deposit of a relatively small fraction of money due to inadvertent mistake – Court can exercise discretion under Section 148 CPC to extend the time even after the time fixed has expired. Held: The Supreme Court reaffirmed that courts have the jurisdiction to extend the time for deposit of money in a pre- emption suit under Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Such an extension can be allowed when there is a bona fide mistake and the deficiency is minor. The Supreme Court held that the facts were similar to Johri Singh v. Sukh Pal Singh and Others [1989] Supp. 1 SCR 17 case wherein it was held that non-deposit of a relatively small fraction of the purchase money due to inadvertent mistake, allows the court discretion under Section 148 CPC to extend the time even after the time fixed has expired, provided the mistake is bona fide and not indicative of negligence or inaction. Accordingly, the Supreme Court set aside the impugned of the High Court, allowing the appellants to deposit the balance amount of ₹14/- by 20.05.2024. [Paras 15-18] * Author 886 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
