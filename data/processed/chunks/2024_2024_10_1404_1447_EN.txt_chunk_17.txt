Thus, the Competition Commission is a necessary party in cases where an appeal is preferred against s or directions in proceedings initiated suo moto by it since it is a dominus litus in such proceedings;49 c. The Competition Commission is a proper party in other matters for the following reasons: i. The Commission is an expert body and discharges regulatory functions.50 The assistance rendered by the Commission would be useful for a complete and effective adjudication;51 and ii. Regulations 24 to 26 of the Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations 200952 define the powers of the Commission to join or substitute parties in proceedings, allow persons or enterprises to take part in proceedings and to strike out unnecessary parties. The 2009 Regulations stipulate that the person or enterprise to be impleaded must have a substantial interest in the outcome of the proceedings and/or that it must be necessary in public interest.53 This principle must be extended to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Tribunal. The Competition Commission has a substantial interest in the outcome of the proceedings in most cases as the s of the Tribunal: (i) will be binding on it; (ii) provide guidelines for determining various matters of larger public interest; and (iii) affect the economic policy of the country. 48 [2010] 11 SCR 112 : (2010) 10 SCC 744 [104] 49 [2010] 11 SCR 112 : (2010) 10 SCC 744 [105,112] 50 See Brahm Dutt v. Union of India, AIR 2005 SC 730 51 [2010] 11 SCR 112 : (2010) 10 SCC 744 [106] 52 “2009 Regulation” 53 The Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations 2009; Regulation 25(1) 1428 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 31. The Competition Act, unlike the AERA Act, expressly provides the statutory authority with the right to present its case before the Appellate Tribunal.54 Section 52T of the Competition Act also expressly grants the Competition Commission the right to file an appeal before this Court against an of the Appellate Tribunal.55 The of this Court in Competition Commission of India (supra), however, does not hinge only on the express stipulations in the Competition Act. This Court drew a functional analysis of the role of the Competition Commission. This Court by creating a distinction between proceedings initiated by the Competition Commission suo moto and others, in effect made a classification between matters in which the Commission is an “interested party” and the ones in which it would assist in “effective adjudication”. When the Commission initiates proceedings suo motu, it is discharging its duty to: (a) eliminate practices having an adverse effect on competition; (b) promote and sustain competition; (c) protect the interests of consumers; and (d) ensure the freedom of trade by other participants in markets in India. Thus, when it initiates a suo moto proceeding, it is discharging its function as a party vitally interested in the elimination of anti-competitive practices. In appeals against the s of the Commission in inquiries initiated otherwise (on receipt of information or on a reference made to it by the Central Government or a State Government or a statutory authority56), the representation of the Commission is seen as necessary for the effective adjudication in view of its expertise in the field.
