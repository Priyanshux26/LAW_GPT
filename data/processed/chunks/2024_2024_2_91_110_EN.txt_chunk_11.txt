However, there was delay in payment of duty drawback at least from the date of the clarificatory circular dated 05.12.2000. Therefore, respondent would be entitled to interest from the date of the clarification till the date of payment. After observing that the Customs Act provides for interest on delayed refund within the range from five percent to thirty percent, learned Single Judge directed the appellants to pay interest on the delayed refund from the date of the clarificatory circular dated 05.12.2000 till the date of payment within a period of three months. 30. Appellants filed Writ Appeal No.356 of 2006 assailing the aforesaid decision of the learned Single Judge. On the other hand, respondent also filed a writ appeal being Writ Appeal No.3699 of 2005 assailing the directions of the learned Single Judge to pay interest only from the date of the circular dated 05.12.2000. 30.1. Before the Division Bench, it was contended on behalf of the appellants that it was only under the Foreign Trade Policy, 2004-2009 that for the first time payment of simple interest 106 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports at the rate of six percent per annum in the event of delay in refund of duty drawback was provided. There was no provision for payment of interest on delayed refund of duty drawback on deemed export prior thereto. Therefore, respondent was not entitled to interest even from 05.12.2000 as directed by the learned Single Judge. It was canvassed before the Division Bench on behalf of the appellants that only due to magnanimity on the part of the Central Government refund of duty drawback under deemed export was paid to the respondent. As such, refund would not carry any interest. 30.2. The Division Bench repelled such contentions advanced on behalf of the appellants and held that in view of the circular dated 05.12.2000, it was clarified that even civil construction works were entitled to the benefit of deemed export under the Exim Policy. After saying so, the Division Bench noted that as a matter of fact, an amount of Rs.2,05,79,740.00 was paid to the respondent as duty drawback. Thereafter, the Division Bench analysed the circular dated 05.12.2000 and upon such analysis it was observed that the position vis-à-vis refund of duty drawback in civil construction work treating it as deemed export was clarified in an earlier circular dated 20.08.1998. Thus, according to the Division Bench, by the year 1998 itself, DGFT had clarified that civil construction work was entitled to the benefit of duty drawback as deemed export. Having held so, the Division Bench posed a question as to whether the respondent would be entitled to interest after expiry of three months from the date of the applications for refund of duty drawback? Corollary to the above question was an ancillary question as to whether a clarificatory or declaratory notification or circular would have retrospective operation? After referring to decisions of this Court reported in 1993 Supplementary (3) SCC 234 S. S. Grewal versus State of Punjab, (1995) 2 SCC 630 Rajagopal Reddy (dead) by Lrs.
