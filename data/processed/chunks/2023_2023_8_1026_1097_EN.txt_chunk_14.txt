The accused named in the Final Report were charged only D for the offences under Sections 406, 420 and 419 read with Section 34 IPC and not under any provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 19884. (vii) One V. Ganesh Kumar then lodged a criminal complaint in FIR No.298 of 2017 on 09.09.2017 with the Chennai PS CCB, against E four persons including the Minister Senthil Balaji. It was stated in his complaint that he was an employee of the Transport Department and that one of his colleagues by name Annaraj and his friend R. Sahayarajan were taken by one Prabhu (a relative of the Minister) to the house of the Minister Senthil Balaji and that the Minister instructed them to collect money from persons aspiring to get appointment as Drivers and F Conductors. It was further stated in the complaint that as per the directions of the Minister, an amount totaling to Rs.95 lakhs was collected during the period from 28.12.2014 to 10.01.2015 and that though the amount was given to Prabhu and Sahayarajan, the persons who parted with money did not get appointed. Therefore, persons who paid money started G exerting pressure upon V. Ganesh Kumar forcing him to lodge a complaint on 09.09.2017. Even this complaint, registered as FIR No.298 of 2017, was only for offences under Sections 406, 420 and 506(1). A Final Report was filed on 07.06.2018 in FIR No.298 of 2017, against the Minister Senthil Balaji and three others, only for offences punishable under 4 For short, “PC Act” H Y. BALAJI v. KARTHIK DESARI & ANR. ETC. 1045 [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] Sections 420 and 506(1) read with Section 34 IPC. This Final Report A was filed before the Special Court and the case was numbered as CC No.19 of 2020. Despite specific allegations, the offences under the PC Act were not included. (viii) Another complaint was lodged by one K. Arulmani, on 13.08.2018 with the Commissioner of Police, Chennai City, complaining B that a huge amount of Rs.40,00,000/- was collected by his friends who wanted to get employment in the Transport Corporation and that the money was actually paid to Shanmugam, PA to the Minister at the residence of the Minister in the first week of January, 2015. It was further stated in the complaint that after money was paid to Shanmugam, C the complainant also met Ashok Kumar (brother of the Minister) and Senthil Balaji (Minister) and that the Minister assured to get appointment s issued. This complaint was registered by Chennai CCB PS as FIR No.344 of 2018, again for offences only under Section 406, 420 and 506(1) IPC. We do not know why the State Police were averse to the idea of including the offences punishable under the PC Act, in any D of the three FIRs. While one may be averse to corruption, one cannot be averse to the PC Act. (ix) As had happened in respect of the other two complaints, the complaint in FIR No.344 of 2018 was also investigated (or not investigated) and a Final Report was filed on 12.04.2019.
