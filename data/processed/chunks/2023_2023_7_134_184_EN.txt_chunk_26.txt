As held by this Court in the said decision, the provisions of Section 173(8) of the CrPC have been enacted to take care of such like situations also. F 74. In N.P. Jharia v. State of M.P. reported in (2007) 7 SCC 358, proceedings had been initiated against the appellant therein in connection with possession of pecuniary resources disproportionate to his known sources of income. After investigation the Special Police Establishment (SPE) submitted a “final report” on 01.03.1990 informing G the court that no offence was made out against the appellant. The final report was accepted by the Special Judge on 17.04.1990. But on 01.07.1992, the SPE submitted an application before the Special Judge, seeking permission for further investigation. The Special Judge permitted further investigation. Thereafter, the sanction for prosecution was obtained from the State Government on 01.03.1995. The chargesheet H 170 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A was filed in the court on 24.07.1995. On behalf of the appellant, it was urged that once the final report was submitted there is no scope for further investigation. The Court held that so far as further investigation was concerned in the background of Section 173(8) of the CrPC the plea was clearly untenable. B 75. In Kari Choudhary v. Mst. Sita Deviand Others reported in (2002) 1 SCC 714, FIR No. 135 was registered on the basis of a complaint lodged by Sita Devi and investigation was commenced thereafter. During investigation, the police found that the murder of the victim, Sugnia Devi was committed pursuant to a conspiracy hatched by her mother-in-law Sita Devi and her daughters-in-law besides the others. C So, the police sent a report to the court on 30.11.1998 stating that the allegations in FIR No. 135 were false. The police continued with the investigation after informing the court that they had registered another FIR as FIR No. 208 of 1998. This Court, inter alia, held thus: “11. Learned counsel adopted an alternative contention that D once the proceedings initiated under FIR No. 135 ended in a final report the police had no authority to register a second FIR and number it as FIR No. 208. Of course the legal position is that there cannot be two FIRs against the same accused in respect of the same case. But when there are rival versions in E respect of the same episode, they would normally take the shape of two different FIRs and investigation would be carried on under both of them by the same investigating agency. Even that apart, the report submitted to the court styling it as FIR No. 208 of 1998 need be considered as an information submitted to the court regarding the new discovery made by F the police during the investigation that persons not named in FIR No. 135 are the real culprits. To quash the proceedings merely on the ground that final report had been laid in FIR No. 135 is, to say the least, too technical. The ultimate object of every investigation is to find out whether the offences G alleged have been committed and, if so, who have committed it.
