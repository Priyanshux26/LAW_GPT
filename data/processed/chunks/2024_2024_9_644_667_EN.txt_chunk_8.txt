In case, the defendants i.e., the present appellants come under the definition of “tenant” the impugned has to be set aside. However, if the case is that the appellant does not come under the definition of “tenant” as referred above, this appeal would fail. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 655 Rajesh Mitra @ Rajesh Kumar Mitra & Anr. v. Karnani Properties Ltd. 8. On behalf of the appellants, we have heard learned counsel Ms. Rashi Bansal, who relies on the decision of the Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court (Goutam Dey v. Jyotsna Chatterjee reported in 2012 SCC OnLine Cal 642). In the above cited case, the original tenant had died prior to the enforcement of the1997 Act. He was survived by his daughter and her husband, Goutam Dey. Subsequently, the daughter of the original tenant also died in 2011, after which the respondent-landlord filed a suit for eviction against Goutam which was decreed. By virtue of section 2(h) of the 1956 Act, it was held that a vested right had accrued in favour of the daughter of the original tenant, which could not be abrogated by the enactment of the 1997 Act. It was further held that if section 2(g) of the 1997 Act was interpreted literally, it would mean that all inherited tenancies under the 1956 Act would expire on 09.07.2006 (five years after the coming into force of the 1997 Act). This is a position which cannot be tenable in law according to the learned Single Judge in the above case. It was held that the phrase “or from the date of coming into force of the act, whichever is later” was wrongly drafted by the legislature, and it is in fact redundant. This is what was said: “19. Even otherwise, I am of the further view that portion of section 2(g), as extracted in the preceding paragraph starting from “or” and ending with “later”, and on which Mr. Bhattacharya laid emphasis, if read literally would produce absurd results and, therefore, the provision must be so read so as to make it meaningful. Law is well settled that in exceptional circumstances, it would be proper for the Court to depart from the literal rule and such rule of interpretation could be adopted that is just, reasonable and sensible, and does not offend the sense of justice. In the context, one may possibly conceive either of three inevitable situations, - death of a tenant (i) before July 10, 2001; (ii) after July 10, 2001; and (iii) on July 10, 2001. Regarding situation (i) i.e. death of a tenant before July 10, 2001 and the case with which I am concerned (Sunil died on May 4, 1997), undoubtedly it was the Act of 1956 that was in force and had a tenant governed by the provisions of the Act of 1956 died on July 9, 2001 or even previous to that date, the tenancy would be governed by that Act meaning thereby that the tenancy being 656 [2024] 9 S.C.R.
