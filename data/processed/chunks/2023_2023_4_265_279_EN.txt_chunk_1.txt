Further, it was after the directions issued by this Court on 04.12.2020 and 02.05.2022 that the matter was again considered by the competent authority and it was decided to defer D the question of commutation in view of the reasons given in the affidavit filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Thus, it cannot be alleged that there has been an inordinate delay in disposal of the Mercy Petition. [Para 17][277-H; 278-A-C] 2. Without going into any further issues as argued by counsel E for the parties, it is found that there are directions by this Court vide s dated 4.12.2020 and 2.5.2022 to dispose of the Mercy Petition of the petitioner. It is also found that the Ministry of Home Affairs, upon material consideration of various reports from its different branches, has come to the conclusion that the consideration may be deferred as it could have an impact of F compromising the security of the nation or creating law and situation. It would not be within the domain of this Court to delve upon the decision of the competent authority to defer taking of any decision at present. It is within the domain of the executive to take a call on such sensitive issues. As such this Court does G not deem it appropriate to issue any further directions.
