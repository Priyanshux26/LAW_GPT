The State of Maharashtra is in appeal before us challenging the of the Division Bench of Bombay High Court dated 18.08.2009, which has allowed the writ petition of the respondent, while setting aside the of the Deputy Superintendent of Stamps, Maharashtra (appellant no.2). We have heard learned counsel Mr. Aniruddha Joshi for the appellants and learned senior counsel Ms. Madhavi Divan for the respondents. 2. National Organic Chemical India Ltd. (respondent) was incorporated with an initial share capital of Rs.36 crores. In 1992 it increased its share capital to Rs. 600 crores and accordingly paid a stamp duty of Rs.1,12,80,000/- as per Article 10 of Schedule-I of the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958 (hereinafter “Stamp Act”). At that time, the provision read as under: 1 2 Description of Instrument Proper Stamp Duty 10. ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION One thousand rupees for OF A COMPANY – Where the every rupees 5,00,000 or Company has no share capital or part thereof. nominal share capital or increased share capital. The State of Maharashtra (appellant no.1) on 02.08.1994 amended Article 10 and introduced a maximum cap of Rs.25 lakhs on stamp duty which would be payable by a company. The amending notification is reproduced below in part: 344 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (a) of Section 9 of the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958 (Born. LX of 1958), the Government of Maharashtra, having satisfied that it is necessary to do so in the public interest, hereby reduces, with effect from the 1st August, 1994, the maximum duty chargeable on Article of Association of a Company under Article 10 of Schedule-I to the said Act, to Rs. Twenty Five Lakhs.” Subsequently, the respondent passed a resolution for a further increase in its share capital to Rs.1,200 crores and paid Rs. 25 lakhs as stamp duty when it filed its Notice in Form No.5,1 pursuant to Section 97 of the Companies Act, 1956 (hereinafter “Companies Act”). However, according to the respondent this was done inadvertently as it was soon realised that stamp duty was not liable to be paid by them since the maximum stamp duty which was of Rs. 25 lakhs payable on Articles of Association as per the provisions of the Stamp Act, had already been paid by them in 1992. Consequently, the respondent wrote a letter to appellant no.2 seeking a refund of the payment of Stamp Duty of Rs. 25 lakhs. This request was turned down by appellant no.2, vide dated 20.01.1998 where it was stated that whenever the authorised share capital of a company is increased, stamp duty is payable on each such occasion at the time of filing of Form No. 5 and it is not a one time measure. Aggrieved, the respondent filed a writ petition before the Bombay High Court challenging the aforesaid and seeking refund of Stamp Duty of Rs. 25 lakhs with interest, paid by them inadvertently.
