105. Section 26 of the RBI is the provision which directly falls for E consideration. The same reads thus: “26. Legal tender character of notes.-(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), every bank note shall be legal tender at any place in India in payment, or on account for the amount expressed therein, and shall be guaranteed by the Central Government. F (2) On recommendation of the Central Board the Central Government may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that, with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification, any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender save at such office or agency of the G Bank and to such extent as may be specified in the notification.” 106. It can thus be seen that sub-section (1) of Section 26 of the RBI Act provides that, subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), every bank note shall be legal tender at any place in India in payment, or on account for the amount expressed therein, and shall be guaranteed by H 66 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A the Central Government. Sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act provides that on recommendation of the Central Board, the Central Government may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that, with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification, any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender save at such office or agency of the Bank and to such extent as may be B specified in the notification. 107. Section 34 of the RBI Act provides that the liabilities of the Issue Department of the RBI shall be an amount equal to the total of the amount of the currency notes of the Government of India and bank notes for the time being in circulation. C 108. Perusal of the aforesaid provisions of the RBI Act would reveal that insofar as monetary policy and specifically with regard to the matters of management and regulation of currency are concerned, the RBI plays a pivotal role. As a matter of fact, both the sides are ad idem on the said issue. D 109. The importance of the role assigned to the RBI in such matters would be amplified from the various s of this Court, which we will refer to in the paragraphs to follow. In this background, we will consider the issues that fall for our consideration. ISSUE NO. (i) : WHETHER THE POWER AVAILABLE E TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT UNDER SUB-SECTION (2) OF SECTION 26 OF THE RBI ACT CAN BE RESTRICTED TO MEAN THAT IT CAN BE EXERCISED ONLY FOR “ONE” OR “SOME” SERIES OF BANK NOTES AND NOT “ALL” SERIES IN VIEW OF THE WORD “ANY” APPEARING F BEFORE THE WORD “SERIES” IN THE SAID SUB- SECTION, SPECIFICALLY SO, WHEN ON EARLIER TWO OCCASIONS, THE DEMONETIZATION EXERCISE WAS DONE THROUGH THE PLENARY LEGISLATIONS? 110. It is strenuously urged by the learned Senior Counsel appearing G on behalf of the petitioners that the word “any” used in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act will have to be given a restricted meaning to mean “some”.
