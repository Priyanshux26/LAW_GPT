[Para 199] 2. Mere conduct of parties aimed at frustrating the court proceedings or circumventing its decisions, even without an explicit prohibitory , constitutes contempt – Such actions interfere with the administration of justice, undermine the respect and authority of the judiciary, and threaten the rule of law – However, at the same time, the power of contempt ought to be exercised sparingly and with caution and care – It operates with a string of caution and unless otherwise satisfied beyond doubt, it would neither be fair nor reasonable for the courts to resort to such powers – The standard of proof required before a person is held guilty of committing contempt of court must be beyond all reasonable doubt – The courts while exercising its contempt jurisdiction must remain circumspect, more particularly, where there exists a possibility of the being amenable to more than one interpretation.
