108. As rightly contended by Shri S.R. Raghunathan, learned counsel for A-4, no Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under Section 193 IPC, except on a complaint in writing of that Court or E of some other Court to which that Court is subordinate. This bar is found in Section 195(1)(b)(i) of the Code. No complaint was ever made by any Court or by any officer authorized by any Court that A-1 or A-3 or A-4 committed an offence punishable under Section 193 IPC. But unfortunately, the Trial Court convicted A-1, A-3 and A-4, of the offence under Section 193 without any application of mind and the same has F been upheld by the High Court. 109. Even according to the prosecution, the only role played by A-4 was that of being a member of a Committee constituted on 23.12.1992. Much ado was sought to be made, about the nature of the Committee and as to whether it was a Tender Committee or Negotiation G Committee. Due to the heat and dust created about the role and the name of the Committee, it was completely overlooked that this Committee came into the picture only after much water had flown under the bridge, by (i) deciding to go for a Restricted Tender; (ii) by issuing tender notices to seven identified contractors; (iii) by receiving the offers from five contractors; and (iv) by opening the tender documents on 18.12.1992 H A. SRINIVASULU v. THE STATE REP. BY THE INSPECTOR OF 67 POLICE [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] for the purpose of further processing. For the purpose of establishing an A offence of cheating, what is important is the mindset at the beginning, when the criminal conspiracy was hatched. At the time when the criminal conspiracy was allegedly hatched in October/November, 1992, A-3 and A-4 were not at all in the picture. They came into the picture only on 23.12.1992. The Note dated 23.12.1992 by which the Negotiation B Committee was constituted brings on record the fact that five named contractors had submitted their offers. The names and addresses of all the five contractors, the amounts quoted by them and the date and mode of receipt of the offers are all presented in the form of a table in the Note dated 23.12.1992. After noting all these particulars, the Note date dated 23.12.1992 proceeds to state the object behind the constitution of C the Committee as follows:- “As the quoted value by the tenderers are very high, it is proposed to conduct negotiation with the lowest three tenderers under Serial Nos.1 to 3.” D 110. Therefore, the reading of the trial Court and the High Court as though this Committee of which A-3, A-4 and the Approver were a part, was actually a Tender Committee having a larger role to play, is completely misconceived. 111. In fact, the prosecution had to stand or fall on the strength of E the testimony of the Approver namely PW-16. But this is what PW-16 said about the role played by A-3 and A-4.
