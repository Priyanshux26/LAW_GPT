In case the State fails to file chargesheet or supplementary request for remand within the stipulated 60/90 day period, we need to C strike a balance between the rights of the individual and the restriction on those rights and prevent prolonged incarceration without legal support. The very instance, the statutory remand period ends, an indefeasible right to default bail accrues to the accused and same needs to be guarded. The liberty of the individual is surely relative and regulated. Absolute D liberty is something that cannot be conceived in a societal setting. The law therefore allows authorities to detain accused persons and facilitate investigation. However, it is the duty of this court to discourage prolonged incarceration. Further, the right to default bail is not extinguished by the subsequent filing of the chargesheet, and the accused continues to have the right to default bail. E 43. The Constitutional foundation, touching upon the liberty of an individual was first explained in the dissenting opinion of Justice Fazl Ali in AK Gopalan32- where he described the doctrine of interoperability of rights. This minority view became the majority ruling in the later case of RC Cooper33 and Maneka Gandhi.34 The doctrine stipulates that F fundamental rights are not isolated and separate, but rather form an interconnected web of liberty and freedom. Any law that takes away liberty has to be just, fair and reasonable and pass muster of the collective operation of rights mentioned under Articles 14, 19 and 21.

Furthermore, this court in Kesavananda Bharti,35speaking through the then Chief Justice Sikri, noted that, India having acceded to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), and the Constitutional mandate in Article 51, would require the Court to B treat rights as inalienable, and this should guide the constitutional interpretation. 44. At this stage, we may benefit by remembering the dissenting opinion of Justice Louis D. Brandeis in Olmstead vs. US.36His words in the 1920’s ruling on personal liberty, ring true even after a century. Justice C Brandeis observed: “Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the government’s purposes are beneficent.
