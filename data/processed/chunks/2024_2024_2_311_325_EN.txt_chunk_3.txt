IHFL had also undervalued the shares and securities on the basis of false and forged documents and had caused great loss to the Shipra Estate Company and its Directors. 9.

Thus, the terms and conditions contained in the permission letter, indemnity certificate and sub-lease document were violated by the financial institution and 316 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the sub-lessee, due to which the YEIDA had suffered a financial loss of about Rs. 200 crores. 10.
