applicable to the cases where search was conducted prior to amendment A but the notices under Section 153C of the Act, 1961 have been issued after the amendment. It is also submitted on behalf of the Department that the amendment does not take away vested rights, and hence can be applied retrospectively. It is further contended on behalf of the Department that the date of the search is not relevant to Section 153C of the Act, B 1961 and the amended provision would apply as both the satisfaction note and assumption of jurisdiction were post 01.06.2015. In relation to the aforesaid contentions of the Department, it is submitted on behalf of the respective assessees that a machinery provision that affects substantive rights cannot be held to be retrospective. That though Section 153C of the Act, 1961 is a machinery provision, the amendment cannot C be held to be retrospective. 5.3 It is next submitted that as rightly observed by the High Court though the provisions are machinery provisions, the amendment brings into its fold persons not otherwise covered and hence affects the substantive rights and, therefore, cannot be made applicable D retrospectively. In support of their submission that the amendment to Section 153C by Finance Act, 2015 shall not be made applicable retrospectively and with respect to the search carried out prior to 01.06.2015, reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Controller of Estate Duty Vs. M.A. Merchant, 1989 Supp (1) SCC E 499. It is submitted that in the said decision, this Court had refused to interfere with the vested rights by allowing reopening of an assessment completed prior to the date w.e.f. which the new section in the Estate Duty Act came into force. 5.4 It is contended that in the present case, the amendment to F Section 153C by Finance Act, 2015 brings into the fold of Section 153C of the Act, 1961, assessees, who were not so far covered by it, i.e., persons to whom books of account/documents pertain or relate to, and not just persons to whom it belong. That this widening, thus, affects substantive rights, as new assessees may now be proceeded against and hence the decision of this Court in the case of M.A. G Merchant(supra) has rightly been applied by the High Court. 5.5 It is further contended that it is well settled that even procedural laws grant substantive rights and amendments affecting such rights have been held to be prospective. That reopening has been held to be a question of power and not procedure as observed and held by this Court in the H 772 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A case of State of Tamil Nadu Vs. Star Tobacco Co., (1974) 3 SCC 249. 5.6 It is next contended that the amendment to Section 153C of the Act, 1961 has added a new class of assessees and not merely changed the procedure for the existing assessees, hence it cannot be given B retrospective effect.
