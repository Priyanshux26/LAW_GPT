The said sale was effected at a time when QA the eldest brother was the Mutawalli. The sale was effected by a person who in other words was not the Mutawalli. Therefore, Article 96 did not apply. As far as the second sale is concerned, it was effected by QA on 26.09.1974 purporting E to convey his one-third right to his nephew who is the first respondent in the other appeal. The further reasoning of the High Court is that the second sale deed was executed by the Mutawalli. The court thereafter demarcated the field covered by Articles 65 and 96. The court then also took into consideration Section 27 of the Limitation Act, 1963. The Court found the proper F interpretation was that Article 96 was to be confined to suits to recover possession where the right to recover possession had already not been lost under Section 27 of the Limitation Act, 1963. Article 96, in other words, it was found, applied to voidable transfers. On the said basis, finding that the second sale G represented a case of void transfer, it was found that Article 96 did not assist the appellant. It was also found that there is no obstacle in a beneficiary of a Wakf perfecting title by adverse possession. Such an obstacle, undoubtedly, existed in the case of a Mutawalli, a trustee or a co-owner. A beneficiary was none of the above. Thus, proceeding on the basis that the first respondent H SABIR ALI KHAN v. SYED MOHD. AHMAD ALI KHAN AND 933 OTHERS in both the appeals were beneficiaries of the Wakf and as the A sales under which they claimed were found to be void, the period of limitation contemplated under Article 65 of the Limitation Act began to run from the date of the sale. This meant that when the Act was born on 01.01.1996, the title stood vested with the first respondent by adverse possession. It is further found that Section B 107 of the Act under which the Limitation Act was not applicable to the Act could not rescue the case of the appellant. [Para 16][958- G-H; 959-A-E] 1.2. As far as the first sale is concerned, the sale was not effected by the Mutawalli or the Manager of the Waqf. The sale C was effected by the brother of the Mutawalli. Thus, the High Court is correct in finding that Article 96 will not come to the aid of the appellant. [Para 20][961-C-D] 1.3. As far as the second sale is concerned, it was no doubt, executed by the Mutawalli by sale deed 26.09.1974. This is a D sale executed by him on the strength of the compromise which was entered into between the three brothers on 13.02.1974. The compromise led to dated 12.09.1974 being passed by the Deputy Director (Consolidation) setting aside the dismissal of the revision by dated 20.09.1969 as also the dismissal of the first restoration application dated 02.03.1972. If the said sale E is found to be valid, then obviously, the appellant would fail.
