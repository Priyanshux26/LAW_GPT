F 52. Article 21 has played a significant role in shaping the law on tortious liability of the Government. This Court has asserted that the concept of sovereign function, which acts as an exception to attracting tortious liability, ends where Article 21 begins. Therefore, this Court has been willing to defend life and liberty of persons against state lawlessness by holding that where Article 21 is violated, the State has to pay G compensation and the concept of sovereign function does not prevail in this area. 53. This proposition may be specifically traced to early PILs, which began in India in the 1980s, primarily in cases where officials of the State, such as prison officials had mistreated prisoners. The focus of the H 796 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A first phase of PIL in India was on exposure of repression by the agencies of the state, notably the police, prison, and other custodial authorities. These early PILs were essentially Constitutional tort actions which concerned allegations of violation of protected fundamental rights, as a result of acts or omissions on the part of officials of the State. Therefore, Constitutional law and tort law came to be merged by this Court under B the rubric of PIL, and this Court began allowing successful petitioners to recover monetary damages from the State for infraction of their fundamental rights. In such cases, there may have been statutory rights of persons also which would then be an enunciation of an aspect of Fundamental Rights particularly under Article 21 of the Constitution. C 54. In Rudul Sah vs. State of Bihar, (1983) 4 SCC 141, Y.V. Chandrachud, CJ., gave further momentum to fundamental rights to combat state lawlessness by granting cash compensation to a victim of unlawful incarceration for fourteen years. It is to be noticed that His Lordship, in the said case, took note of the dilemma in allowing a litigant D to seek damages in a writ petition/PIL action against the State. His Lordship noted that this could have the effect of ordinary civil action being circumvented on a routine basis, by invoking writ jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme Court as an alternative to ordinary civil action. However, it was recognized that granting such remedies would enhance the legitimacy of the vehicle of PIL. Therefore, this E Court in Rudul Sah ultimately chose to grant monetary damages, in to ‘mulct’ the violators, as well as to offer a ‘palliative’ for victims.
