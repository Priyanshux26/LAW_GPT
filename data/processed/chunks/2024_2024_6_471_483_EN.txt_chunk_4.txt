[…]” [2024] 6 S.C.R. 477 Chaitra Nagammanavar v. State of Karnataka & Ors. to time in the made by the Government under clause 4 of Article 16 of the Constitution of India.” (emphasis supplied) 10.2 There was uncertainty about the applicability of the procedure contemplated under Sec. 4 of the Reservation Act, 1990 for the appointments of teachers by the universities, as Section 4 speaks about appointments in the civil service of the state and civil posts under the State of Karnataka. A common understanding was that an office in the civil service of the state or a civil post under the state did not include ‘teachers’ as contemplated under S. 53 of the Universities Act. This uncertainty was greater with respect to filling up of backlog vacancies in the university by following the procedure provided in the 2001 Rules. 10.3 It is under these circumstances that an amendment was proposed to the Reservation Act, 1990. The statements of objects and reasons (‘SOR’) for the introduction of sub-section (1A) to Sec. 4 clarifies the position and helps us understand the newly introduced sub-Section (1A) in its proper perspective. “Amending Act 8 of 2004.- Government issued a Notification dated: 21.11.2001 under the Karnataka Civil Services (Unfilled Vacancies reserved for the persons belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Special Recruitment) Rules, 2001 for filling up of vacancies reserved for persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This Special Recruitment Rules was published under clause (a) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Karnataka Civil Services Act, 1978 (Karnataka Act 14 of 1990) in Notification No. DPAR 13 SBC 2001, dated 6th August 2001. The Notification was issued to fill all unfilled vacancies by all the appointing authorities wherever the service conditions are governed by the Karnataka Civil Services Act, 1978. The Cabinet appointed a sub-committee of the Cabinet to monitor and review the progress. The Social Welfare Department was made the nodal Department. As on date the Social Welfare Department has identified 17021 numbers of vacancies out of them, 14485 have 478 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports already been notified, of which 11573 vacancies are filled up and the balance is in the process of being filled. During the course of the review meeting it was pointed out to the Cabinet Sub Committee that the Karnataka Civil Services (Unfilled Vacancies reserved for the persons belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Special Recruitment) Rules, 2001 does not apply to the Universities, including Agriculture Universities and other institutions, etc., because they do not come under the purview of the said Rules. The non-inclusion of these institutions under the purview of the Notification dated 21.11.2001 and 1.6.2002 meant that the filling up of the backlog vacancies by the Universities and other institutions could suffer from a legal infirmity. In view of the fact that the process of recruitment by these institutions i.e., Universities etc. 80% of the recruitment are already over, both for teaching and non-teaching staff and the persons recruited have already reported and are working, there is an immediate need to amend the Act to legally enforce the recruitment’s already made.
