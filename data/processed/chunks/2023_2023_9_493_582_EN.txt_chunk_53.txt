In terms of unamended Article 308, the definition of ‘State’ included Part A and Part B states of the First Schedule and did not H 40 “1956 amendment” GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI v. UNION OF INDIA 565 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] include Part C States, since they were administered by the Union. After A the 1956 Constitutional Amendment, Article 308 provides an exclusionary definition of ‘State’ by only excluding the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 308 does not provide any clarity on whether “State” includes Union Territories for the purposes of Part XIV. 126. Article 366 defines “State” with reference to Articles 246- B A,268, 269-A and Article 279-A to include a Union Territory with Legislature. Article 366 does not apply for the interpretation of any of the provisions in Part XIV of the Constitution. Thus, we must fall back on Article 367. Article 367 stipulates that unless the context otherwise requires, the General Clauses Act shall apply for the interpretation of C the Constitution. Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act defines “State” to mean a State specified in the First Schedule and includes a Union Territory. 127. GNCTD contends that this Court in Prem Kumar Jain (supra) has expressly sanctified the existence of services of a Union D Territory by holding that the definition of “State” would include Union territories for the purpose of Article 312 of the Constitution. The Union has argued that the decision in Prem Kumar Jain was limited for the purpose of the IAS (Cadre) Rules 195441 read with the All-India Services Act 1951. Furthermore, it was argued that the reference to Article 312 made therein has been made without any reference to the import of E Article 308. It is the contention of the Union that interpreting the ratio of Prem Kumar Jain in a broad sense would cause violence to the machinery envisaged in Part XIV of the Constitution. 128. In Prem Kumar Jain, the of the High Court of Delhi setting aside the establishment of a joint cadre exclusively for the F Union Territories in the IAS was challenged. Article 312 stipulates that Parliament may by law create “All India Services” common to the Union and the States. A joint cadre of all the Union Territories was created under Rule 3(1) of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules 1954.42 The creation of a new joint cadre was challenged before the G High Court on the ground that it was contrary to Article 312 of the Constitution and the All-India Services Act 1951. It was argued that Article 312 does not contemplate an all-India service common to Union 41 1954 Cadre Rules 42 “1954 Cadre Rules” H 566 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A territories because the term “State” in the provision does not include Union territories. The definition of “State” under Rule 2(c) of the 1954 Cadre Rules, which provides that a State means a “State specified in the First Schedule to the Constitution and includes a Union Territory” was also challenged.
