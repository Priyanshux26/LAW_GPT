Insofar as Major Singh (PW-6), Sarpanch of the village is concerned, he stated that he was informed by Randhir Singh (PW-4), father of the deceased that in-laws of the deceased were harassing her and therefore they should go to village Chatha. However, he also does not state that he was informed by Randhir Singh (PW-4), father of the deceased that the deceased was meted out to any harassment on account of non-fulfi llment of demand of dowry. We are therefore of the considered view that there is no evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was harassed on account of non-fulfi llment of demand of dowry. We therefore fi nd that the case under Section 304-B of IPC is not made out by the prosecution. 18. In the result, we pass the following : (i) The appeal is allowed; (ii) The and of conviction as recorded by the trial court dated 14th September 1999 and affi rmed by the High Court vide its impugned and dated 24th July 2009 are quashed and set aside; and (iii) The appellant is acquitted of all the charges levelled against him and his bail bonds shall stand discharged. 19. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of in the above terms. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Ankit Gyan
