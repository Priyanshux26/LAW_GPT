8652-8653 of 2023, are liable to be dismissed, upholding the views expressed in the impugned s. Accordingly, they are dismissed. 90. The only other question to be considered is with respect to the custody of the appellant. The learned Solicitor General submitted that the period of 15 days expires by 12.08.2023. Even the learned Principal Sessions Judge has granted 8 days of custody, though could not be given eff ect to. Conscious of the time constraint, we are inclined to permit the respondents to have custody of the appellant till 12.08.2023. Accordingly, the appeals arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) Nos. 7437 of 2023, 7460 of 2023, and 8750 of 2023 fi led by the respondents are disposed of. Application for intervention is dismissed. Application for direction stands disposed of giving liberty to the applicant to have recourse to the remedy known to law. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of. 91. As already noted hereinabove, the Registry is directed to place the matter before Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate s to decide the larger issue of the actual import of Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 as to whether the 15 days period of custody in favour of the police should be only within the fi rst 15 days of remand or spanning over the entire period of investigation – 60 or 90 days, as the case may be, as a whole.
