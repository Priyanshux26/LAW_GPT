most — at the time of standing for the cause of the WSSCOඌ to realise their rights under the Constitution and be treated on an equal footing as male offi cers who are granted PC.” 10. The nub of the dispute in the present case relates to the manner in which the CRs of the women offi cers were assessed for the purpose of Special No 3 SB after the decision in the above case. 11. In a communication dated 12 December 2022, the MS Branch dealt with the modalities to be followed by Special No 3 SB in respect of the women offi cers “post” (that is, after) “the grant of PC”. As regards their CRs, paragraph 2(b) of the letter reads thus: “CRs. The dates of Cut-off CR for WOs Spl No 3 SB will be same as that of their corresponding male batches, when they were considered by No 3 SB.” 12. The grievance of the women offi cers who are before this Court is that as a result of the above direction, all the CRs of women offi cers commencing from the 1992 batch onwards until 2005 have not been duly considered and the more recent CRs have been excluded from consideration. This is indicated in the tabulation which is annexed to the application before the Court which is reproduced below: S No Batch Approx Cut off Spl No 3 SB dt No of years of which CR Dt CRs not considered for Spl No 3 SB (Approx) 1. 1992 2008 09 Jan 2023 14 2. 1994 2010 09 Jan 2023 12 3. 1995 2011 10 Jan 2023 11 4. 1996 2012 11 Jan 2023 10 5. 1997 2013 12 Jan 2023 09 6. 1998 2014 13 Jan 2023 08 7. 1999 2015 14 Jan 2023 07 8. 2000 2016 15 Jan 2023 06 9. 2001 2017 16 Jan 2023 05 10. 2002 2018 17 Jan 2023 04 11. 2003 2019 18 Jan 2023 03 NITISHA AND OTHERS v. UNION OF INDIA 519 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 12. 2004 2020 19 Jan 2023 02 13. 2005 2021 20 Jan 2023 01 13. We have heard Mr Huzefa Ahmadi and Ms V Mohana, senior counsel in support of the applications which have been fi led by the women offi cers. Mr R Venkataramani, Attorney General appears for the Union of India with Mr R Balasubramanian, senior counsel. 14. The grievance which has been put forth by Mr Ahamdi and Ms Mohana is precisely this: (i) In terms of the policy circulars the empanelment of women offi cers for the rank of Colonel is required to be considered on the basis of all the CRs after the ninth year of service; (ii) In the in Nitisha (supra), this Court had emphasized the need to consider the entire profi le of the women offi cers albeit in the context of the grant of PC; (iii) An anomalous situation has resulted under which though for the grant of PC, the entire reckonable service has been taken into account, yet in the matter of considering them for empanelment as Colonels, a large chunk of their CRs has been excluded from consideration by Special No 3 SB on the basis of bringing about an ostensible parity with male offi cers; and (iv) The approach which has been adopted by the Army authorities is contrary to the policy circulars as well as to the of this Court.
