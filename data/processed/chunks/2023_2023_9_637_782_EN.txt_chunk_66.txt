169. Mr. Ajit Bhasme, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant-Board urged the following common legal submissions: a. MSEB Conditions of Supply, as then prevalent under the 1910 B Act and the 1948 Act, are statutory in character, as held by this Court in Hyderabad Vanaspati (supra). The Conditions of Supply are in addition to and not in lieu of other modes of recovery; b. MSEB Conditions of Supply are a part of the standard C agreement entered into between the consumer and the Electricity Company. Clause 14 of the standard agreement between the Electricity Board and the consumer incorporates the Conditions of Supply as a part of the agreement; c. The reliance placed by the Bombay High Court on the D judgement in Isha Marbles (supra) cannot be sustained since the case of Isha Marbles (supra)is distinguishable on facts; d. The General Auction Conditions of Sale of SICOM in Clause 2 stipulate that the sale is on “as is where is and what is” basis. Auction purchasers were put on notice of their liability E for the past electricity arrears due to the inclusion of the standard auction proclamation (Clause 6) while inviting bids; e. Regulation 10.5 of Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005 explicitly states that any unpaid electricity dues shall be a charge on the premises transferred; and F f. All six cases pertain to the period prior to 2005 i.e., before the enactment of the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005. The 1976 MSEB Conditions of Supply would continue to operate till the enactment of the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code in 2005. G 171. In Maharashtra, the right of the Electric Utilities to demand outstanding dues is traceable to provisions across different time periods: a. Up to enactment of the 2003 Act on 10 June 2003: The governing laws are the 1910 Act and the 1948 Act. The MSEB Conditions of Supply were framed under Section 49 of the H K. C. NINAN v. KERALA STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD & 727 ORS. [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 1948 Act. The MSEB Conditions of Supply which were made A effective from 1 January 1976 would apply; b. From 10 June 2003 to 20 January 2005: The provisions of the 2003 Act were brought into force with effect from 10 June 2003. The 1910 Act and 1948 stood repealed after the enactment of the 2003 Act. The Maharashtra Electricity B Supply Code 2005 came into force from 20 January 2005. In the interregnum, the MSEB Conditions of Supply would continue to apply, so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the 2003 Act. This is due to the following reasons: C i. By virtue of Section 185(2)(a) of the 2003 Act, notwithstanding such repeal anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken including any rule, notification, inspection, or notice made etc. under the repealed law shall, in so far as it is not D inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of this Act.
