Case Arising From CIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION : Writ Petition (Civil) No. 294 of 2015 (Under Article 32 of The Constitution of India) Appearances for Parties Rana Mukherjee, Ahanthem Romen Singh, Ms. Oindriala Sen, Mohan Singh, Aniket Rajput, Ms. Khoisnam Nirmala Devi, Rajiv Mehta, Advs. for the Petitioner. Vijay Hansaria, Sr. Adv., Maibam Nabaghanashyam Singh, Ms. Kavya Jhawar, Ms. Nandini Rai, Advs. for the Respondents. / of the Supreme Court 1. Heard Mr. Rana Mukherjee, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner. The respondents – High Court of Manipur and the Registrar General are represented by Mr. Vijay Hansaria, learned Senior Counsel. 2. While deciding this writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, there was a difference of opinion and having regard to the conflicting s rendered by the two learned Judges on 7.10.2016, the matter was directed to be placed before a three- judge Bench. Thereafter, when a similar question of law was found pending before the Constitution Bench i.e., in Tej Prakash Pathak and Others vs. Rajasthan High Court and Others1 (for short “Tej Prakash 1 Tej Prakash Pathak And Ors. v. Rajasthan High Court And Ors. C.A. No. 2634/2013 & batch 888 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Pathak”), this case was tagged with the said case. On 12.07.2023, however submission was made before the Constitution Bench by the learned counsel for the parties that reference to the Constitution Bench along the lines in Tej Prakash Pathak (supra) is unnecessary and therefore the difference of opinion between the two Judges in the present case should be resolved by a three-Judge Bench. 3. According to the learned Senior Counsel for the parties, this case can be segregated and the Court should, inter alia, consider the following aspects :- “I. Can executive instructions in the form of a resolution of the Full Court override statutory rules made under Article 234/309? II. Can the criteria of cut-off marks be introduced by a Full-Court Resolution without amending the rules after the written test is over without informing the candidate? III. Whether such a course of action amounts to procedural fairness/unfairness?” 4. Thereafter, an was passed by the Constitution Bench on 12.07.2023 to place the present matter for hearing before a three- Judge Bench and that is how we are posted with this case.
