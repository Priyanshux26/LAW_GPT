The appellants who are the defaulters could not be given preferential treatment by accepting the certificates produced by them as valid, though the same were obtained by them after the last date for the submission of applications fixed in the B advertisement. The said certificates were also not supported by the requisite affidavits as per the Government circulars dated 09.09.2015 and 08.08.2019. 34. In view of the afore-stated factual and legal aspects of the matter, I do not find any error having been committed by the High Court C while passing the impugned s and s. In that view of the matter, the appeals being devoid of merits are dismissed. Ankit Gyan Matter be placed before Hon'ble CJI (Assisted by : Tamana, LCRA) for constitution of appropriate Bench.
