These Regulations are essential tools for ensuring the efficient administration and operation of the Commission, addressing various procedural and managerial aspects necessary for fulfilling its mandate. Focusing narrowly on the nomenclature and the absence of an explicit provision for Regulation-making within the RTI Act would undermine the broader purpose and intent of the same. The nomenclature used to describe these Regulations should not detract from their necessity and their role in facilitating the Commission’s functioning. A purposive interpretation of Section 12(4) of the RTI Act reveals that the powers of “superintendence, direction and management” are intended to be comprehensive, enabling the CIC to adopt measures, including the framing of Regulations, that ensure transparency, accountability, and efficient handling of its responsibilities. Thus, the creation of these Regulations is not only justified but crucial for the CIC to manage its workload and operational demands effectively, thereby serving the core objectives of the RTI Act. 23. At this juncture, it is necessary to elucidate that under Section 12(4) of the RTI Act, the CIC has the authority to issue various forms of administrative guidelines, directives and instructions essential for the effective management of its affairs. The ‘Central Information Commission (Management) Regulations, 2007,’ framed by the CIC, could have been pronounced as ‘Circulars,’ ‘By-laws,’ or any other similar administrative s. The primary objections have been raised due to the word “Regulations,” which respondents argue, confers the gravity of a separate legislation. However, this interpretation misses the substantive purpose behind these measures. The use of the term “Regulations” should not detract from their function, which is akin to any other administrative s or circulars that an authority like the CIC might promulgate to ensure the smooth operation of its duties. The essence of these regulations lies in their role in facilitating the internal management and procedural operations of the Commission, a necessity clearly envisioned by the broad powers of superintendence, direction, and management granted under Section 12(4) of the RTI Act. By focusing on the terminology, the objections fail to appreciate [2024] 7 S.C.R. 633 Central Information Commission v. D.D.A. & Anr. the functional equivalence of these regulations to other forms of administrative guidance. The regulations were crafted to address the practical needs of the Commission, providing structure and clarity to its operations, in any administrative context. Therefore, raising objections based solely on the label “Regulations” is an exercise in semantics rather than a substantive argument. 24. We believe that the autonomy of the Central Information Commission is of paramount importance to its effective functioning. Any undue interference in its administrative functions, such as the power to constitute benches, would significantly impede its ability to handle the large volume of cases efficiently and expeditiously. The CIC must be allowed to operate independently and exercise its powers of superintendence, direction, and management without external constraints. The principle of non-interference is crucial for maintaining the integrity and efficacy of the CIC. Allowing the Commission to function autonomously ensures that it can fulfil its role in promoting transparency and accountability, which are the cornerstones of the RTI Act.
