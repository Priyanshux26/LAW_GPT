Assailing the of the High Court granting relief to the delinquent, Mr. Kailash Vasudev, learned Senior Counsel would point out that notice(s) were issued on 06.10.1995, 06.11.1995 and 19.12.1995 to the respondent prior to the chargesheet-cum- show cause notice on 14.02.1996. In those, the delinquent was informed about his unauthorized absence from office with effect from 25.09.1995 and requiring him to rejoin services immediately or action would be taken against him under the LIC Staff Regulation. This was followed by chargesheet-cum-show cause notice which reflected the endorsement of the Postal Authorities to the communication dated 06.11.1995 to the effect that on enquiry it was learnt that the respondent had abandoned his job and left his place of residence. As all the notice(s) remained unanswered by the delinquent, the authorities invoked the powers under Regulation 39 (1)(f) and ed delinquent’s removal from service. 6. When the appeal of the delinquent was rejected by the Appellate Authority through dated 19.08.1997, the respondent filed the writ petition resulting in the impugned s of the Single Judge and Division Bench of the High Court. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2373 Life Insurance Corporation of India & Ors. v. Om Parkash 7.1 Mr. Kailash Vasudev, learned Senior Counsel would firstly submit that the appellant(s) had taken all steps to serve notice on the delinquent who was not to be found since 25.09.1995 and therefore treated it to be a case of abandonment of service. The termination of service was accordingly ed, under the Regulation 39(4)(iii). 7.2 It is next pointed out that around that period, the respondent secured employment as AG-III Depot in the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on 14.04.1997 and although this was an important indication of abandonment of service by the respondent, he failed to disclose the same in the Writ Petition No.41 of 1998, which subsequently came to be filed before the High Court on 05.01.1998. 7.3 The Senior Counsel submits that the respondent absented from duty for 90 days without intimation to his employer and since the notice(s) addressed to the delinquent remained unanswered, conducting an inquiry into the charge of unauthorized absence was an impossibility. Therefore, the employer had rightly treated it to be a case of abandonment of service and terminated the respondent. 8. The respondent despite notice, was un-represented and accordingly Mr. Jaideep Gupta, learned Senior Counsel was requested to assist the Court. Mr. Gupta adverts to the circumstances under which the respondent’s services were dispensed with by the appellant(s) and points out that service of notice as claimed by the appellant(s), may have to be treated with caution as the concerned notice(s) were sent to different addresses. 9. On the above aspect, it is discernible that three notice(s) were sent to the permanent address. In response to the second notice dated 06.11.1995 which returned back to the appellant(s), the postal remarks in Hindi reads as under: “pata karne par pata chala hai ki praptkarta kahin se naukari chodkar chala gaya hai. R.L. wapas ki jati hai” [English Translation: on enquiry it has come to know that the consignee has left job and gone.
