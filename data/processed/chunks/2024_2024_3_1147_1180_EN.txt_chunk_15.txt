(vii) human sensibilities are not offended by vulgarity, obscenity or depravity; *** (ix) scenes degrading or denigrating women in any manner are not presented; (x) scenes involving sexual violence against women like attempt to rape, rape or any form of molestation or scenes of a similar nature are avoided, and if any such incident is germane to the theme, they shall be reduced to the minimum and no details are shown; ***” Clause (3) reads thus: “3. The Board of Film Certification shall also ensure that the film— (i) is judged in its entirety from the point of view of the overall impact; and (ii) is examined in the light of the period depicted in the film and the contemporary standards of the country and the people to which the film relates, provided that the film does not deprave the morality of the audience.” 1168 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and the purpose of censorship is not to protect the pervert or assuage the susceptibilities of the over-sensitive.40 Further, the use of swear words and expletives that are heard everyday was also held to be harmless.41 The Court rather emphasised the overarching social purpose and message of the film – to condemn rape and violence against women by showing the trauma and emotional turmoil of a victim of rape and to evoke sympathy for her and disgust for the rapist.42 Thus, the material was held as not being obscene. 23. Similarly, in Director General, Directorate General of Doordarshan v. Anand Patwardhan43, the Court applied the test of ‘contemporary community standards’ to determine whether a documentary is obscene for the purpose of certification and telecast on Doordarshan. A three- prong test for obscenity was formulated as follows: “(a) whether “the average person, applying contemporary community standards” would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.”44 24. The Court relied on Ramesh v. Union of India,45 where it was held that the effect of the words must be judged from the standards of a reasonable, strong-minded, firm and courageous person, and not from the perspective of weak and vacillating minds or those who sense danger in every hostile point of view.46 Considering the documentary as a whole to determine its message, which cannot be conveyed by watching only certain bits, it was held that the film portrays social evils and does not seek to cater to the prurient interests of any person.47 40 ibid, paras 27 and 28 41 ibid, para 29 42 ibid, paras 28, 31, 33 43 [2006] Suppl. 5 SCR 403 : (2006) 8 SCC 433 : 2006 INSC 558 44 ibid, para 32 45 [1988] 2 SCR 1011 : (1988) 1 SCC 668 : 1988 INSC 44 46 Directorate General of Doordarshan (supra), para 37 47 ibid, para 38 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
