Supreme Court Reports Held: Hardly any cordiality or meaningful marital relationship emerged from the marriage of the parties – Submission of the wife that she intends to continue her marital relationship with the husband cannot be accepted – Events stated deterred the husband from continuing with his marital relationship with the wife – It is difficult to fathom as to how the wife can reasonably expect her spouse to continue in a cordial marital relationship with her, when she has filed a criminal case against him, got a “Look Out Circular” issued against him, and even got him arrested – On one hand, petitioner sought the dismissal of application u/Art.142(1) on the ground that she wishes to continue the marriage, while in the same breath, she has demanded a huge sum of money as permanent alimony equalling the share received by the respondent’s ex-wife – Petitioner’s criminal complaint, among other things, has left incurable scar on the relationship between the parties – No chance for the parties to reconcile their differences and lead a normal married life hereinafter – Marriage has completely failed and also no child born out of the wedlock – Thus, fit case to exercise discretion u/ Art.142(1), as such the application u/Art.142(1) is allowed and the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent is dissolved on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage – As regards, permanent alimony the wife sought equalisation of status not just with the respondent-husband but also with the ex-wife of the respondent, which cannot be an acceptable approach – Petitioner cannot simply claim an amount equal to what the ex-wife of the respondent had received or on the basis of the income of the respondent – Court has to not just consider the income of the respondent-husband, but also bear in mind other factors such as the income of the petitioner-wife, her reasonable needs, her residential rights, and other similar factors – Thus, her entitlement to maintenance has to be decided based on the factors applicable to her – Also duration of marriage, a relevant factor to be taken into consideration which was hardly three to four months – In the petition seeking divorce by mutual consent, respondent agreed to pay sum of Rs.8 crores towards full and final settlement of all claims of the petitioner – Family Court assessed Rs.10 crores as the quantum of permanent alimony, which is accepted – Additional amount of Rs.2 crores is liable to be paid to the petitioner to enable her to acquire another flat – Thus, sum of Rs.12 crores to be paid as permanent alimony to the petitioner by the respondent as a full and final settlement of all her claims on the respondent and his family – Also Rs.
