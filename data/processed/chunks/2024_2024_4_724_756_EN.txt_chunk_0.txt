Headnotes Insurance Act, 1938 – s.45, before the 2014 amendment – Evidence Act, 1872 – Burden of proof – Onus of proof – Repudiation of insurance claim of the complainant on the ground of the material suppression of information regarding the previous policies – Consumer complaint filed – The District Commission allowed the complaint on the ground that no documentary evidence was available to show that deceased-insured had taken various insurance policies from other companies – The State Commission upheld the of the District Commission – However, the NCDRC observed that the respondent insurance company had given details of the aforesaid policies by way of affidavit and the same was not denied by the complainant in her affidavit – Therefore, NCDRC concluded that deceased insured had withheld information in respect of several insurance policies which he had taken from other insurers – Correctness: * Author [2024] 4 S.C.R. 725 Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali India Life Insurance Company Limited & another Held: As per the language and interpretation of Section 45, the insurer cannot question the policy after the expiry of the time period and if it does, then the burden rests on the insurer to establish materiality of the fact suppressed and the knowledge of the insured about such suppression, so that the repudiation of the claim could be justified by the insurer – In the present case, the onus was on the insurer to show that the insured had fraudulently given false information and the said information was related to a material fact – The respondent insurance company has produced no documentary evidence whatsoever before the District Forum to prove its allegation that the insured had taken multiple insurance policies from different companies and had suppressed the same – Before the State Commission, the respondent had provided a tabulation of the 15 different policies taken by the insured-deceased – However, the said tabulation was not supported by any other documentary evidence, like the policy documents of these other policies, or pleadings in courts, or such other corroborative evidence – The NCDRC had accepted the averment of the respondents, without demanding corroborative documentary evidence in support of the said fact – The approach adopted by the NCDRC was not correct – The cardinal principle of burden of proof in the law of evidence is that “he who asserts must prove”, which means that if the respondents herein had asserted that the insured had already taken fifteen more policies, then it was incumbent on them to prove this fact by leading necessary evidence – The onus cannot be shifted on the appellant to deal with issues that have merely been alleged by the respondents, without producing any evidence to support that allegation – The respondents have merely provided a tabulation of information about the other policies held by the insured-deceased – The table produced is incomplete and contradictory as far as the date of birth of the insured is concerned – Therefore, the NCDRC could not have relied upon the said tabulation and put the onus on the appellant to deal with that issue in her complaint and thereby considered the said averment as proved or proceeded to prove the stance of the opposite party – The repudiation of the policy was without any basis or justification – Thus, the impugned passed by the NCDRC set aside.
