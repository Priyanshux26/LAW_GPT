Similarly, in Prakash Jha (supra)120, this Court rejected a film ban founded on public . The Court noted that the film dealt with a sensitive subject of reservations but it had been duly cleared by examining committees comprising legal and subject matter experts and members belonging to the Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Class communities, who had approved the screening of the film. 72.5. The Board must decide whether a disparaging portrayal stood redeemed by the overall message or not. No doubt this entails a complex balancing of interests as we noted at the outset. It would be ideal if the statutory bodies included subject matter experts. We believe the 2024 Rules are a welcome acknowledgment of this principle and consultations with subject matter experts on disability would certainly better 115 1983 Rules, Rules 41 (4) (c), (d). 116 2024 Rules, Rules 23 (3), 25 (3), 117 S Rangarajan (supra) [52]. 118 [1980] 1 SCR 1081 : (1980) 1 SCC 43 119 Raj Kapoor (supra) [Justice Pathak, 26] – “Regard must be had by the court to the fact that the certificate represented the of a body of persons particularly selected under the statute for the purpose of adjudging the suitability of films for public exhibition and that extends to a consideration of the principal ingredients which go to constitute offences under Sections 292 and 293 of the Indian Penal Code.” (emphasis supplied). Also see [Justice Krishna Iyer, 14] 120 Prakash Jha Productions v. Union of India, (2011) 8 SCC 372 [13, 26] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 283 Nipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors. inform the perspective of the Board. The policy underlying the Act and the Rules already accounts for expert consultation. This Court cannot interfere merely because it could be better or that a better alternative is available, when the legality of such policy is not in question.121 The Court cannot read additional requirements into unambiguous provisions.122 It is beyond the remit of constitutional courts to specify the qualifications or expertise that the constituents of these bodies must possess or to direct that such a requirement be legislatively included into the statute.123 72.6. The appellant has sought formulation of guidelines to restrict content that contravenes the Constitution and the RPwD Act 2016. We have stated above that the guidelines under the Act are quite extensive and cover the field. Such directions are issued to fill legislative gaps.124 If allowed, such guidelines would be akin to reading the provisions of one statute that is, the RPwD Act 2016 into another statute, that is the Cinematograph Act, even though the latter does not suffer from a vacuum on the issue, and the statutory expert body is presumed to have account for the effect of the former anyway125. Courts cannot trench into policy-making.126 The High Court was therefore, justified in not granting the abovementioned reliefs and we cannot make recommendations to that effect. 73. Since the issue involves the fundamental rights of persons with disabilities, we take this opportunity to provide a framework of the portrayal of persons with disabilities in visual media that aligns with the anti-discrimination and dignity-affirming objectives of the Constitution as well as the RPwD Act.
