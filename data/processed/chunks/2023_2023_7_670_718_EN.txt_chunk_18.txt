609 H 694 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A and forbearance price are dynamic in nature and APPC being associated with the floor price and the forbearance price is also required to be determined on a year-to-year basis so that the guaranteed return to the generators is not affected. Analysis and Findings B 37. The crisis arising out of, and the enormous environmental cost involved in the continued use of fossil fuels has led governments, world over, to promote alternative and renewable sources of energy. The rapid growth of renewable energy over the decade and a half has witnessed that solar and wind power are now the cheapest sources of energy in C many countries in the world. Once green energy was an expensive alternative, however, it is now helping to reduce energy bills. 38. The rapidly changing economics of such sources has led, the Union government to realize that solar and other renewables can potentially transform the energy landscape, increase access and help India meet its climate change objectives. Grid transmission capacity has D been a barrier; however, distributed and off-grid solar solutions provide a viable solution for increasing energy access. Being dependent primarily on cheap coal-based power generation, traditional thinking on energy has been that increase in renewable energy’s share of electricity generation would further impair local distribution companies’ poor E financial situation. Over the years, India has established a comprehensive policy and regulatory frameworks to encourage renewable energy development. India began its development of wind power in the 1990s and has significantly increased its capacity over the last few years. Compared to established countries with wind energy capacities like the USA or Denmark, India is a latecomer. Yet, its support for wind power, F through its policies has resulted in India becoming the producer with the fourth largest installed wind power capacity, in the world; wind power accounts for 10% of India’s total installed power capacity. As of February 2023, the installed capacity of wind power in India was 42,015 megawatts (MW).27 G 39. Section 86 of the Act enumerates the functions of state commissions; Section 86 (1)(e) reads as follows: 27 Physical Progress (Achievements) Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Govt. of India. https://mnre.gov.in/the-ministry/physical-progress, visited on 06.04.2023 at 20:30 hours. H GUJARAT URJA VIKAS NIGAM LIMITED v. RENEW WIND 695 ENERGY (RAJKOT) PVT. LTD. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] “Section 86(1): The State Commission shall discharge the A following functions, namely: ****************** ***************** (e) promote cogeneration and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy by providing suitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of electricity to any B person, and also specify, for purchase of electricity from such sources, a percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area of a distribution licensee;” 40. State Commissions have placed significant emphasis on the last part of this important clause while developing regulations for C Distribution Licensees under their jurisdiction. The National Tariff Policy, issued by the Central Government in terms of Section 3 of the Act states as follows: “Clause 6.4: Non-conventional sources of energy generation including co-generation: D (1) Pursuant to provisions of section 86(1)(e) of the Act, the Appropriate Commission shall fix a minimum percentage for purchase of energy from such sources taking into account availability of such resources in the region and its impact on retail tariffs.
