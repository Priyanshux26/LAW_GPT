18. It is relevant to note that in paragraph 9 of the dated 28.02.2013 (Annexure-P10), the learned Sessions Judge after referring to the term ‘complaint,’ defined under Section 2(d) of the Cr.P.C. and taking note of the aforesaid essentials to constitute a complaint made a scrutiny of the written objection dated 05.05.2011 submitted by the second respondent-complainant against the negative report dated 28.02.2011 held that the said objection dated 05.05.2011 could not be termed as a ‘narazi complaint’ and found that it did not qualify to the definition of the term ‘complaint’. In that context, with reference to the definition in Section 2(d) of the Cr.P.C. and the essentials to constitute a complaint as referred above, it can only be said that the said finding of the learned Sessions Judge is perfectly in tune with the position of law. Once that is so found and when it is a fact that the negative report on the original complaint dated 11.11.2010 was accepted after rejecting the written objection/protest petition dated 05.05.2011 it cannot be said that the learned CJM has gone wrong in describing the complaint dated 20.07.2011 as the second complaint. The clarification required to the observation/finding referred to as (ii), with reference to the Abhinandan Jha’s case (supra) is that though it would be open to the Magistrate to treat a protest petition as complaint and to take further proceedings in accordance with law even after accepting final report that is permissible only if the protest petition concerned satisfies the ingredients to constitute 12 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports a complaint as defined under Section 2(d), Cr.P.C. Since the narazi petition dated 05.05.2011 did not satisfy the ingredients to attract Section 2(d), Cr.P.C., it could not be treated as a complaint as held by the learned Sessions Judge. At the same time, in view of what is stated above and taking note of the fact that the allegations made in the original complaint are reiterated in the complaint dated 20.07.2011 and pray for further action by the court, it is rightly taken by the courts below as a complaint. Since the final report on the original complaint was already accepted after rejecting the narazi petition the complaint dated 20.07.2011 which satisfies all requirements of a complaint, if at all having the characteristics of a protest petition, could be treated as a complaint and hence, the learned CJM and the learned Sessions Judge have rightly treated it as a complaint. 19. Now, we will consider the question whether the construction of the law laid down by this Court in regard to the maintainability of a second complaint, in the circumstances mentioned hereinbefore that led to the moot question, by the High Court as reflected under paragraph 20 of the impugned and the consequential direction can be sustained. Paragraphs 20 and 21 in the impugned read thus: - 20. Evidently, the learned Magistrate did not act upon the said protest petition, inasmuch as, the learned Magistrate did not proceed under Section 200/202 of the CrPC treating the same as narazi complaint.
