In the very same spirit, this Court has held that when there is a hierarchy of appeals provided under the statue, a party ought to exhaust the statutory remedies before resorting to approaching a writ court. (Refer: G. Veerappa Pillai v. Raman & Raman Ltd. and Others 14, C.A. Abraham v. ITO and Another15, Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. and Another V. State of Orissa and Others16, Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Others17 and Punjab National Bank v. O.C. Krishnan18). 19. The rule of alternative remedy came up for discussion in in Whirlpool Corporation (supra) and it was held thus: “14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provision of the Constitution. This power can be exercised by the High Court not only for issuing writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the Constitution but also for “any other purpose. 13 (2003) 2 SCC 107 14 [1952] 1 SCR 583 : (1952) 1 SCC 334 : AIR 1952 SC 192 15 (1961) 2 SCR 765 : AIR 1961 SC 609 16 [1983] 2 SCR 743 : (1983) 2 SCC 433 : 1983 SCC (Tax) 131 : AIR 1983 SC 603 17 [1998] Supp. 2 SCR 359 : (1998) 8 SCC 1 : AIR 1999 SC 22 18 [2001] Supp. 1 SCR 466 : (2001) 6 SCC 569 [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1247 Ernakulam Regional Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd.
