Section 42(2) B provides that after the document is duly stamped, it shall be admissible in evidence, and may be acted upon. 28. In our view, the decision in SMS Tea Estates [SMS Tea Estates (P) Ltd. v. Chandmari Tea Co. (P) Ltd., (2011) 14 SCC 66 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 777] does not lay down the correct position C in law on two issues i.e. : (i) that an arbitration agreement in an unstamped commercial contract cannot be acted upon, or is rendered unenforceable in law; and (ii) that an arbitration agreement would be invalid where the contract or instrument is voidable at the option of a party, such as under Section 19 of the D Contract Act, 1872. 29. We hold that since the arbitration agreement is an independent agreement between the parties, and is not chargeable to payment of stamp duty, the non-payment of stamp duty on the commercial contract, would not invalidate the arbitration clause, or render it E unenforceable, since it has an independent existence of its own. The view taken by the Court on the issue of separability of the arbitration clause on the registration of the substantive contract, ought to have been followed even with respect to the Stamp Act. The non-payment of stamp duty on the substantive contract would not invalidate even the main contract. It is a deficiency which is F curable on the payment of the requisite stamp duty. 30. The second issue in SMS Tea Estates [SMS Tea Estates (P) Ltd. v. Chandmari Tea Co. (P) Ltd., (2011) 14 SCC 66 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 777] that a voidable contract would not be arbitrable as it affects the validity of the arbitration agreement, is in our G view not the correct position in law. The allegations made by a party that the substantive contract has been obtained by coercion, fraud, or misrepresentation has to be proved by leading evidence on the issue. These issues can certainly be adjudicated through arbitration. H 308 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A 31. We overrule the in SMS Tea Estates [SMS Tea Estates (P) Ltd. v. Chandmari Tea Co. (P) Ltd., (2011) 14 SCC 66 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 777] with respect to the aforesaid two issues as not laying down the correct position in law.” 7. We may also notice paragraph-32 in N.N. Global (supra): B “32.Garware [Garware Wall Ropes Ltd. v. Coastal Marine Constructions & Engg. Ltd., (2019) 9 SCC 209 : (2019) 4 SCC (Civ) 324] has followed the in SMS Tea Estates [SMS Tea Estates (P) Ltd. v. Chandmari Tea Co. (P) Ltd., (2011) 14 SCC 66 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 777] . The counsel C for the appellant has placed reliance on para 22 of the to contend that the arbitration clause would be non-existent in law, and unenforceable, till stamp duty is adjudicated and paid on the substantive contract. We hold that this finding is erroneous, and does not lay down the correct position in law.
