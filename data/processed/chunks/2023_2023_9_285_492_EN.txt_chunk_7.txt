A plain reading of Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899 makes it clear that it does not preclude an Arbitrator or Collector to impound the unstamped/insufficiently stamped document. [Para 79.4][474-E-F] 3. The Arbitrator under Section 16 has the jurisdiction to F decide on “existence” and “validity”. A plain reading of Section 11(6A) would show that the examination by Court is confined only to “existence” and not even “validity”. Moreover, the present reference only concerns with the formal requirement of stamping and not arbitrability. Applying contextual interpretation to render an arbitration agreement void on the formal G requirement of stamping would defeat the very purpose of the Arbitration Act, 1996. A document cannot be rendered invalid or unenforceable especially if the defect is curable under the Stamp Act, 1899. Moreover, none of the provisions in the Stamp Act, 1899 have the effect of rendering a document invalid. Thus, the H M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v.
