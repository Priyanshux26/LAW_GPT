1191 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 for the bye-elections to be held for the Mangaldoi constituency in 1979. The apprehension of the local population was that a large number of illegal immigrants had managed to get themselves on the electoral rolls thereby rendering the local population a minority in the coming bye-elections. The resentment soon translated into state-wide movement against illegal immigration, which was led at the forefront by several student-run organisations. 113. As Sangeeta Barooah Pisharoty has discussed in her book, Assam: The Accord, The Discord82, and as also discussed in paragraph 56 of this , initially, the demand of the protesting students was that the National Register of Citizens (“NRC”) prepared in the year 1951 should act as the baseline for detection and deportation of illegal immigrants. However, during the course of negotiations, an understanding was reached that 24.03.1971 would act as the cut-off date for detection and deportation of illegal immigrants. However, to avoid deadlocks and expedite the settlement, a further cut-off date of 01.01.1966 was decided as the cut-off date for disenfranchisement as opposed to deportation of the immigrants belonging to the 1966-71 stream. In other words, the said cut-off date was decided as the baseline for detection of immigrants and their consequent deletion from the electoral rolls. 114. Thus, it appears from an overview of the historical context that the only purpose behind the introduction of an additional cut-off date of 01.01.1966 and the corresponding concept of detection and deletion from the electoral rolls was to assuage the apprehensions of the protesting students. By mandating the deletion of all the immigrants belonging to the 1966-71 stream from the electoral rolls, it was hoped that the effect of wrongful inclusion of immigrants in the electoral rolls on the upcoming elections would be mitigated. 115. However, as discussed in the later paragraphs of this , the object of removal of the immigrants belonging to the 1966-71 stream from the electoral rolls could only be meaningful if it was given effect through an exercise of en-masse detection and deletion conducted within a fixed time-period. It can be seen from paragraph 62 of this that the protesting leaders in Assam at the relevant point 82 sAnGeetA BArooAh pishAroty, supra, note 45. 1192 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of time were opposed to the conduct of elections to the Parliament and State Legislature unless and until the names of immigrants were dropped from the electoral rolls. 116. Another purpose which is clearly discernible from the scheme of Section 6A is the intention of the legislature to confer citizenship on the immigrants in a graded manner. To illustrate, an immigrant who crossed the b and came into Assam sometime before 01.01.1966, was conferred with automatic deemed citizenship on the date of coming into force of Section 6A, that is, 07.12.1985. On the other hand, an immigrant who crossed the b to come into Assam between 01.01.1966 and 24.03.1971 had to undergo detection, deletion and registration as specified in Section 6A(3).
