1 was not even posted as the S.H.O or T.I at the Police Station when the said false case was registered – Respondent no. 1 himself admitted that he was in fact posted at District, 120 kms away from Gwalior during the relevant time – Thus, any act or offence committed by the respondent no. 1 can safely be said to have been outside the scope of his official duty which obviates the question of sanction for his prosecution – Requirement of sanction is one that may arise at any stage of the proceeding – No requirement of sanction for respondent no. 1 as he was not posted at the Police station in Gwalior at the relevant time where the alleged false was registered – For respondent nos 3, 4, 5 if the prosecution case is correct that they also played dubious role in registering a false case, then the requirement of sanction would not be a sin qua non for proceeding further with the criminal proceedings – However, the defence must be given an opportunity to rebut the same by leading appropriate evidence – Criminal proceedings pending before the CJM, Firozabad should not have been quashed at such [2024] 12 S.C.R. 779 Om Prakash Yadav v. Niranjan Kumar Upadhyay & Ors. a preliminary stage – CJM, Firozabad rightly took cognizance of the charge sheets – High Court erred in considering this aspect while quashing the proceedings – Trial court directed to proceed with the trial and at any stage of trial if evidence suggests that the acts complained of were indeed done or purported to be done in the discharge of official duty by respondent nos. 3, 4 and 5 or that the FIR registered by them was not bogus, the trial may be stayed for want of sanction – Thus, the question of sanction only qua respondent nos. 3, 4 and 5 left open to be appropriately decided by the trial court at a suitable stage – Impugned passed by the High Court set aside.
