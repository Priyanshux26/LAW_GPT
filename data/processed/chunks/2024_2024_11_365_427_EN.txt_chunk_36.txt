In our view, if the 2009 Act is made applicable to minority schools, aided or unaided, the right of the minorities under Article 30(1) of the Constitution will be abrogated. Therefore, the 2009 Act insofar it is made applicable to minority schools referred in clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution is ultra vires the Constitution. We are thus of the view that the majority of this Court in Society for Unaided Private Schools of Rajasthan v. Union of India [(2012) 6 SCC 1] insofar as it holds that the 2009 Act is applicable to aided minority schools is not correct.”] 106 Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education v. K S Gandhi (1991) 2 SCC 716 [13] 107 Ahmedabad St. Xavier’s College Society (supra) [138] (Justice K K Mathew and Justice Y V Chandrachud) 108 P A Inamdar (supra) [122] 414 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports minority educational institutions; (ii) The right of a religious minority to establish and administer Madarsas to impart both religious and secular education is protected by Article 30; and (iii) the Board and the state government have sufficient regulatory powers to prescribe and regulate standards of education for the Madarsas. E. Legislative Competence a. The Madarsa Act is within the legislative competence of the State under Entry 25, List III 80. The distribution of legislative powers is contained in Part XI of the Constitution. Article 246(2) confers exclusive power on Parliament to make laws “with respect to” any of the matters enumerated in List I (the Union List) of the Seventh Schedule. Clause (1) is prefaced with a non-obstante provision which gives it precedence over Clauses (2) and (3). Article 246(2) enunciates the legislative principles with regard to List III (the Concurrent List) and states that both Parliament and State legislatures have concurrent powers of legislation “with respect to” the matters enumerated in this list. This clause also begins with a non-obstante provision giving it precedence over clause (3). Finally, Article 264(3) states that the State Legislature has exclusive power to make laws on the matters enumerated in List II (the State List). 81. When the Constitution was enacted, the subject of “education” was part of List II (the State List) of the Seventh Schedule. This followed the scheme of distribution of powers in the Government of India Act 1935, whereby, the entry titled “Education” was placed in the Provincial List. At the time of the enactment of the Constitution, Entry 11 of List II read as follows: “11. Education including universities, subject to the provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I and entry 25 of List III.” 82. At this time, Entry 25 of List III read as follows: “25. Vocational and technical training of labour.” 83. With effect from 3 January 1977, by the Constitution (Forty-Second Amendment Act),109 Entry 11 of List II was omitted, and Entry 25 of 109 Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, s. 57 (w.e.f. 3-1-1977).
