[“72. […] (1) The first part of Article 14, which was adopted from the Irish Constitution, is a declaration of equality of the civil rights of all persons within the territories of India. It enshrines a basic principle of republicanism. The second part, which is a corollary of the first and is based on the last clause of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment of the American Constitution, enjoins that equal protection shall be secured to all such persons in the enjoyment of their rights and liberties without discrimination of favouritism. It is a pledge of the protection of equal laws, that is, laws that operate alike on all persons under like circumstances.”] 150 State of Andhra Pradesh v.

Supreme Court Reports of the principles of natural justice results in arbitrariness.153 The principle of reasonableness is an essential element of equality.154 Resultantly, a procedure contemplated under Article 21 must be just, fair, and non-arbitrary. This Court has recognized that the concept of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional scheme.155 79. In Union of India v. Tulsiram Patel,156 a Constitution Bench of this Court observed that violation of the principles of natural justice results in arbitrariness: “95. The principles of natural justice have thus come to be recognized as being a part of the guarantee contained in Article 14 because of the new and dynamic interpretation given by this Court to the concept of equality which is the subject-matter of that article. Shortly put, the syllogism runs thus: violation of a rule of natural justice results in arbitrariness which is the same as discrimination; where discrimination is the result of State action, it is a violation of Article 14: therefore, a violation of a principle of natural justice by a State action is a violation of Article 14. Article 14, however, is not the sole repository of the principles of natural justice. What it does is to guarantee that any law or State action violating them will be struck down. The principles of natural justice, however, apply not only to legislation and State action but also where any tribunal, authority or body of men, not coming within the definition of State in Article 12, is charged with the duty of deciding a matter. In such a case, the principles of natural justice require that it must decide such matter fairly and impartially.” 80. Article 14 is an important facet of administrative, judicial and quasi-judicial decision-making in India and demands fair play in action.157 The object of observing the principles of natural justice is to ensure that “every person whose rights are going to be 153 Satyavir Singh v.
