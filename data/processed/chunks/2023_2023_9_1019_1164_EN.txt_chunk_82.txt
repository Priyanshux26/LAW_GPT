C A BRIEF LOOK AT THE FIFTH AMENDMENT CASES IN THE UNITED STATES 123. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, inter alia, declares ‘nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation’. This limb of the Fifth Amendment has spawned a large D body of case law. We may only advert to a few of them. In Agins (supra), the brief facts were as follows: The owners of a five-acre parcel of unimproved land challenged the placing of the land by adopting of Zoning Ordinances, by which, the land was placed in residential planned development and open space zone, E which permitted the owners to build between 1 and 5 single family residences. The appellants asserted infraction of the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments and sought damages for inverse condemnation. (Inverse condemnation amounts to proceedings seeking compensation for compulsorily acquiring land without there being any formal proceedings for acquisition). The challenge was repelled by the U.S. Supreme Court. F It was found that there was no violation of the Takings Clause in the Fifth Amendment. It must be made clear that the Taking Clause is based on the prohibition against the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. The Court, inter alia, held as follows: “The application of a general zoning law to particular property G effects a taking if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests, see Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183, 188, 48 S.Ct. 447, 448, 72 L.Ed. 842 (1928), or denies an owner economically viable use of his land, see Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 138, n. 36, 98 S.Ct. H ASSOCIATION OF VASANTH APARTMENTS’ OWNERS v. 1131 V. GOPINATH & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] 2646, 2666, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978). The determination that A governmental action constitutes a taking is, in essence, a determination that the public at large, rather than a single owner, must bear the burden of an exercise of state power in the public interest. Although no precise rule determines when property has been taken, see Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164, B 100 S.Ct. 383, 62 S.Ct. 332 (1979), the question necessarily requires a weighing of private and public interests. The seminal decision in Euclid v. Ambler Co., 272 U.S. 365, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303 (1926), is illustrative. In that case, the landowner challenged the constitutionality of a municipal ordinance that restricted commercial development of his property. Despite alleged C diminution in value of the owner’s land, the Court held that the zoning laws were facially constitutional. They bore a substantial relationship to the public welfare, and their enactment inflicted no irreparable injury upon the landowner.” 124. In James Patrick Nollan v. Calefornia Coastal D Commission60, the following were the facts: The prospective purchasers of a beach front plot, which was located between two public beaches, proposed to satisfy a condition on their option to purchase by pulling down an old bungalow on the premises.
