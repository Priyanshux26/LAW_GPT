The reason is that if one of the meanings which can be properly ascribed is in consonance with the treaty obligations and the other meaning is not so consonant, the meaning which is consonant is to be preferred. Even where an Act had been passed to give eff ect to the convention which was scheduled to it, the words employed in the Act had to be interpreted in the well- established sense which they had in municipal law. (See Barras v. Aberdeen Steam Trawling & Fishing Co. Ltd. [(1933) AC 402])” 42. This court, in Maganbhai Ishwarbhai Patel & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.25 followed the ruling of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Ontario & Ors.26 (which had made some observations in the context of a rule applicable within the British Empire). This court’s ruling in Maganbhai Ishwarbhai (supra) is the most signifi cant, on this aspect. The relevant observations are as follows: “It will be essential to keep in mind the distinction between (1) the formation, and (2) the performance, of the obligations constituted by a treaty, using that word as comprising any agreement between two or more sovereign States. Within the British Empire there is a well-established rule that the making of a treaty is an executive act, while the performance of its obligations, if they entail alteration of the existing domestic law, requires legislative action. Unlike some other countries, the stipulations of a treaty duly ratifi ed do not within the Empire, by virtue of the treaty alone, have the force of law. If the 25 1970 (3) SCR 53 26 [1937] A.C. 326 ASSESSING OFFICER CIRCLE (INTERNATIONAL TAXATION) 2(2)(2) 1167 NEW DELHI v. M/S NESTLE SA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] national executive, the Government of the day, decide to incur the obligations of a treaty which involve alteration of law they have to run the risk of obtaining the assent of Parliament to the necessary statute or statutes.... .Parliament, no doubt, ... .has a Constitutional control over the executive : but it cannot be disputed that the creation of the obligations undertaken in treaties and the assent to their form and quality are the function of the executive alone. Once they are created, while they bind the State as against the other contracting parties, Parliament may refuse to perform them and so leave the State in default.” These observations are valid in the context of our Constitutional set up.” 43. The issue was more pointedly dealt with by the concurring of J.C. Shah, J (who relied on Oppenheim’s International Law, 8th Edition): “...Such treaties as aff ect private rights and, generally, as required for their enforcement by English Courts a modifi cation of common law or of a statute must receive parliamentary assent through an enabling Act of Parliament. To that extent binding treaties which are part of International Law do not form part of the law of the land unless expressly made so by the Legislature. ********************************* The binding force of a treaty concerns in principle the contracting States only, and not their subjects.
