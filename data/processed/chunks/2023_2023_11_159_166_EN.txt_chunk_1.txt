App. No.4 of 2008(A) 3 Th e Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948 (hereinaft er ‘the Act’) 4 Wrongly typed in the impugned as 24.11.2002 E.S.I. CORPORATION, REP. BY THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR v. 161 M/s. ENDOCRINOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY LAB [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] 2. Briefl y stated, as per the facts available on record, the respondent establishment is a pathological laboratory. Inspection of the premises of the respondent was carried out by the Inspector on 01.04.1999. Having found that there were 19 employees working in the establishment, a show cause notice was issued to the respondent. The respondent establishment challenged coverage of the establishment by fi ling an application under Sections 75 and 77 of the Act before the Employees’ Insurance Court. The Court vide dated 19.04.2007, passed in I.C. No.13/2003 declared that the establishment of the respondent is a ‘shop’ as per Section 1(5) of the Act and the provisions of the Act would extend to the respondent w.e.f. 22.11.2002. A review application5 fi led by the respondent before the E.S.I. Court, was dismissed vide dated 21.12.2007. The s of the E.S.I. Court were challenged by the respondent by fi ling an appeal before the High Court which was allowed vide impugned . 3. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the passed by the High Court is not in conformity with the law as the respondent establishment will be covered under the provisions of the Act in terms of the notifi cation dated 27.05.1976 issued by the Government of Kerala in exercise of the powers conferred under the Act. In terms of the aforesaid notifi cation, if 10 or more persons are employed in an establishment on any day in the preceding 12 months which included a “shop”, it will be covered under the provisions of the Act. The respondent establishment being a shop, was clearly covered. After inspection, a notice was issued to the respondent for coverage w.e.f. 01.04.1999. However, in view of the Circular dated 22.11.2002, issued by the Corporation for the coverage of pathological laboratories and diagnostic centres, the establishment was covered from 22.11.2002. It is stated that the fi ndings of the High Court that the respondent establishment shall be covered under the Act w.e.f. 06.09.2007, is erroneous. 4. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that there is no error in the passed by the High Court. Notifi cation dated 27.05.1976, issued by the Government of Kerala, does not cover the establishment of the kind that the respondent has, which is pathological laboratory. By no stretch of imagination can it be termed as a shop, where merely buying and selling activities take place, and not the kind of work executed by experts engaged by the respondent. In fact, medical institutions 5 M.P.
