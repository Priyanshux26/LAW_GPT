The report concluded that there was no indication that the fire was due to arson but there were indications that the loss could have been assessed for highly inflated amount. The Chief Vigilance Officer sounded a note of caution to the following effect: “Therefore, adequate precautions should be taken before a final decision is taken in respect of the claim. We would like to suggest that an opinion of technical expert in the concerned field may be taken regarding extent and assessment of loss in to arrive at the actual loss sustained by the claimant. You may also examine the feasibility of having into depth technical investigation into various objects of the claim.” 44. When matter stood thus on 16.06.1999, the Insured wrote to the surveyors stating as under: 306 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “However, against contract price of Rs. 25 crores, we agree and confirm to the assessment of the net adjusted loss of Rs. 20,95,00,000/- (Indian Rupees Twenty Crores Ninety Five Lakhs Only) after taking into account the items of salvage & excess as applicable under the terms and conditions of the policy.” 45.

So stating a request was made for the settlement of the claim at the earliest. This was followed by another letter of 26.11.1999 stating that since the claim had not yet been settled they could not progress in the reinstatement of the mill. They also sought extension of 24 months for the reinstatement of the mill. 46.
