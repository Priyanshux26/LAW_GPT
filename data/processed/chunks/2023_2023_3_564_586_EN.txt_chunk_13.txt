21. Recapitulating the facts, it appears that the said plaintiff Jagtar Singh, the predecessor of the present respondent, had filed the suits on E 06.04.1981 claiming his superior right to pre-empt the sale on the ground of being co-sharer in the joint Khewat alleging inter-alia in the plaint that the original owner of the suit lands Jit Singh had executed the registered sale deeds on 07.04.1980 and 24.04.1980 in favour of the defendants Jhabbar Singh and others, predecessors of the present F appellants, without giving any notice to the plaintiff. Since it was not disputed that the plaintiff Jagtar Singh was the co-sharer in the joint Khewat as per the Jamabandi for the year 1978-1979 (exhibit P-1), it could be safely held that the plaintiff had the right of pre-emption on the date of execution of the sale deeds in question and also on the date of filing of the suits. G 22. However, the core issue that has fallen for consideration before us is, whether the plaintiff Jagtar Singh had the right to pre-empt on the date of passing of the decree by the trial court i.e. on 01.12.1982. 23. As stated earlier, pending the suits, the defendant Jhabbar Singh had filed a Partition case being no. 78/TP in respect of lands in H question before the Assistant Collector, in which the plaintiff Jagtar Singh 582 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A had filed his objections. The Assistant Collector vide the dated 25.05.1982 had rejected the objections of Jagtar Singh and had listed the case on 31.05.1982 for the objections as to the “Naksha Be”, which was already prepared and annexed to the file. As transpiring from the record, on 31.07.1982, the Assistant Collector in presence of the parties provided for the passage and the boundaries of the plots, and passed the B giving details of partition as per the “Naksha Be”, mentioning as to which of the khasara numbers would be allotted to Jhabbar Singh and which to Jagtar Singh. 24. The trial court after discussing various decisions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court held that the Khewat in dispute had remained C no more joint as per the dated 31.07.1982passed by the Assistant Collector, and that the plaintiff had lost his status of a co-sharer on that date. Therefore, according to the trial court, the plaintiff did not possess the status of the co-sharer on the date of decree. The First Appellate Court in the appeals preferred by the plaintiff Jagtar Singh, also while D confirming the s and decrees passed by the trial court and dismissing the appeals of the plaintiff held vide and decree dated 08.04.1983 that the joint relationship between the parties had come to an end as soon as the dated 31.07.1982 was passed by the Assistant Collector, and that the plaintiff had ceased to be the co-sharer in the land in dispute. E 25. However, the High Court in the Second appeals preferred by the original plaintiff Jagtar Singh reversed the concurrent findings recorded by the two courts below and allowed the second appeals, holding inter alia that on the date of the passing of the decree, no instrument of partition was drawn by the Revenue Officer, and therefore it could not F be said that the joint status of the parties had come to an end or that the plaintiff had lost his superior right of pre-emption.
