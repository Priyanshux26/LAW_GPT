From the and dated 18.05.2009 of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in TTR No. 711 of 2002. With B Civil Appeal Nos. 5938 and 5939 of 2011 R K Raizada, Sr. Adv., Bhakti Vardhan Singh, Adv. for the Appellant. Ms. Charanya Lakshmikumaran, Ms. Apeksha Mehta, Ms. Neha C Choudhary, Ms. Falguni Gupta, M. P. Devanath, Ashwani Kumar, Ms. Iti Sharma, Puneet Sharma, Anshay Dhatwalia, Advs. for the Respondent. The of the Court was delivered by S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J. D 1.The question which is urged in all these appeals is the correctness of the view of the High Court that the process which the product in the present case underwent – i.e., mixture of the base paint with different colours – did not result in a ‘new’ product, and therefore did not result from the process of ‘manufacture’ as defined under Section 2(e)(i) of E the U.P. Trade Tax Act, 1948 (“Act”). 2. The facts in all these cases are that the assessees are dealers in inter alia paints. The Revenue contended that the sale of paints which had undergone mixing (through a computerised process with the aid of a DTS machine) amounted to ‘manufacture’, thereby resulting in a new F product, which was a fresh incidence of taxation. The assessee on the other hand contended that mixing per se did not amount to ‘manufacture’, and that on an application of the established principles, no new recognizable product or article had emerged from the process. It is a matter of record that both the base paint and the colourant are taxed G separately. 3. The High Court on a previous occasion had accepted the assessees’ contentions and held that the process did not amount to ‘manufacture’. Upon the Revenue’s appeal in some cases, this Court had remitted the matter for fresh consideration after taking into account expert opinion. The process was observed, and a report dated 20.01.2004 H COMMISSIONER OF TRADE TAX v. M/S.
