The recruitment to the posts of SDI/ABSA is governed by the Uttar Pradesh Subordinate Educational (Sub Deputy Inspector of Schools) Service Rules, 1992 (hereinafter, ‘Rules’). As per the Rules, 80% of the posts of SDI/ABSA are mandated to be filled by direct recruitment through the Public Service Commission, 10% of the posts are to be filled up through selection from amongst the Headmasters of Junior High Schools and the remaining 10% of the posts are filled through the promotion of Extension Teachers and Craft Teachers working in the CT Grade, who were appointed before 21.04.1996 under the Redeployment Scheme. On the other hand, mode of appointment to the post of Headmasters is by way of promotion from among the Assistant Teachers of Junior High Schools. Furthermore, it seems that at one point of time, the SDI/ABSA and DBSA used to exercise supervisory and administrative control over Headmasters and Teachers of Junior High Schools. 13. That being said, in to fully comprehend the origin of this strife and the parallel, as well as the subsequent legal proceedings leading to the current appeal, it would be beneficial to examine the entire set of events hereafter from the vantage point of two rounds of litigation. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1329 State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr. v. Virendra Bahadur Katheria and Ors. The First Round of Litigation 14. The Uttar Pradesh Vidhyalay Nirikshak Sangh (hereinafter, ‘Caveator’), along with the Respondents, filed WP No. 675/2002 before the High Court, alleging discrepancies and seeking the grant of pay scale of 7500-12000 to SDI/ABSA and corresponding higher pay scale to DBSA, on identical terms as per the 2001 . A Division Bench of the High Court, through its dated 06.05.2002, allowed the writ petition after observing that the SDI/ABSA and DBSA were supervising the work of Headmasters and were previously receiving higher pay scales before further the revision w.e.f. 01.07.2001. The High Court viewed that when the pay scale of Headmasters was revised on 20.07.2001, the pay scales of SDI/ABSA and DBSA also ought to have been simultaneously revised. Consequently, the High Court directed the State to grant the pay scale of 7500-12000 with effect from 01.07.2001 to SDI/ABSA and corresponding higher pay scale (8000-13500) with effect from 01.07.2001 to the DBSA. The High Court further directed the State to consider granting the writ-petitioners therein pay scales higher than that of Headmasters on the premise that they had been enjoying a better pay scale prior to 20.07.2001. 15. The aggrieved State challenged the High Court’s through Civil Appeal No. 8869/2003 (arising out of SLP(C) No. 900/2003) before this Court. During the pendency of that Appeal, the State held discussions with the Caveator and referred the matter to the Chief Secretary’s Committee (hereinafter, ‘Rizvi Committee’). The Rizvi Committee made a proposal dated 12.01.2010 (hereinafter, ‘Proposed Policy’), to grant the pay scale of 7500-12000 for the post of Assistant Basic Education Block Officer, which was essentially created by merging the posts of SDI/ABSA and DBSA, thereby creating a singular cadre of 1031 posts.
