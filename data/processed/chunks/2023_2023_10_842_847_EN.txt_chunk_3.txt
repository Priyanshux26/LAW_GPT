Pursuant thereto, E six FIRs were registered on 10 May 2023. Cognizance has been taken by the Special Court on 11 May 2023. This sequence of events which has been indicated in the submissions of Mr PS Patwalia, senior counsel and as authenticated in the submission of the Solicitor General, is not in dispute. Hence, as the matter stands, the NIA has exercised its jurisdiction specifically with reference to its powers under Section 6(5). F 12. At this stage, the Court is not called upon to either decide on the sufficiency of the allegations or their veracity. The remit of this Court would be to determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction by the Central Government under Section 6(5) is extraneous to the powers conferred upon it by Section 6(5) so as to warrant the interference of G this Court. 13. The six FIRs which were registered by the State police authorities were all between 30 March 2023 and 3 April 2023 and straddle four police stations. Of them, two FIRs which have been recorded at Police Station Shibpur on 31 March 2023 relate to incidents which H THE STATE OF WEST BENGAL & ORS. v. SUVENDU ADHIKARI & 847 ORS. [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] occurred on 31 March 2023 and are proximate in time. Likewise, the A same situation appears from the FIRs which have been registered at Police Station Serampore on 2 April 2023 and 03 April 2023. 14. The precise contours of the investigation which should be carried out by the NIA cannot be anticipated or restricted at this stage. Cognizance has also been taken by the NIA Court. B 15. There is no challenge to the validity of the notification which was issued under Section 6(5). 16. Hence, we are not inclined to entertain the Special Leave Petitions, though for the reasons which have been indicated above. C 17. We clarify that the observations which were made by the High Court in the impugned would be confined to the question as to whether the exercise of jurisdiction by the NIA under the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 is valid. For the above reasons, we affirm the of the High Court. D 18. The Special Leave Petitions are disposed of in the above terms. 19. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Ankit Gyan SLPs disposed of. (Assisted by : Aarsh Choudhary, LCRA) E F G H
