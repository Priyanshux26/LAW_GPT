Once the entire bid price is paid and there is no stay granted by any forum known to law, the Bank is duty bound to issue a valid Sale Certifi cate and hand over the physical possession of the secured asset to the auction purchaser. 99. It is also pertinent to note that the Bank and its offi cers took absolutely inconsistent stand. Before the DRT, they opposed the off er for redemption of mortgage as recorded by the High Court at para 11, while before the High Court they made a complete 360 degrees turn and accepted the off er. The lame and weak justifi cation assigned for the same was to bring quietus to the matter. This again shows that the decisions of the Bank are not taken as per the provisions of law but according to the whims and fancies of the Bank offi cers. CELIR LLP v. BAFNA MOTORS (MUMBAI) PVT. 147 LTD. & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] 100. Bank is duty bound to follow the provisions of the law as any other litigant. It is to be noted that the Bank i.e., the secured creditor acts under the SARFAESI Act through the authorised offi cer who is appointed under Section 13(2). Thus, the authorised offi cer and the Bank cannot act in a manner so as to keep the sword hanging on the neck of the auction purchaser. The law treats everyone equally and that includes the Bank and its offi cers. The said enactments were enacted for speedy recovery and for benefi tting the public at large and does not give any license to the Bank offi cers to act de hors the scheme of the law or the binding verdicts. 101. The Bank could be said to have acted contrary to two s of this Court: (i) Satyawati Tondon (supra) and (ii) the dated 16.11.2022 in Varimadugu OBI Reddy (supra). 102. This Court in National Spot Exchange Ltd. v. Anil Kohli, Resolution Professional for Dunar Foods Ltd. reported in (2022) 11 SCC 761 after referring to a catena of its other judgements, had held that where the law is clear the consequence thereof must follow. The High Court has no option but to implement the law. The relevant observations made in it are being reproduced below: - “15.1. In Mishri Lal [BSNL v. Mishri Lal, (2011) 14 SCC 739 : (2014) 1 SCC (L&S) 387], it is observed that the law prevails over equity if there is a confl ict. It is observed further that equity can only supplement the law and not supplant it. 15.2. In Raghunath Rai Bareja [Raghunath Rai Bareja v. Punjab National Bank, (2007) 2 SCC 230] , in paras 30 to 37, this Court observed and held as under : (SCC pp. 242-43) “30. Thus, in Madamanchi Ramappa v. Muthaluru Bojjappa [AIR 1963 SC 1633] (vide para 12) this Court observed: (AIR p. 1637) ‘12. … [W]hat is administered in Courts is justice according to law, and considerations of fair play and equity however important they may be, must yield to clear and express provisions of the law.’ 31.
