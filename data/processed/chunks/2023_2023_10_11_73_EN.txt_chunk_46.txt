137. In view of the above, the finding recorded by the Trial Court and the High Court as though A-7 committed forgery and cheating by E making applications for the issue of demand drafts in the names of bogus firms is wholly unsustainable. 138. The only connecting link pointed out against A-7 was the transfer of money to the total extent of Rs.1,52,50,000/- to the account of a firm of which he was a partner. This by itself will not constitute any F offence. Therefore, the charge that A-7 abetted the commission of the crime by the other accused, should also fail. This is especially so when A-5, whose proprietary concern bagged the contract, not only lost the contract but also allowed the bank guarantee to be invoked by BHEL and in addition, left a huge amount of Rs.2.60 crores still with BHEL. G Therefore, the conviction and sentence awarded to A-7 cannot be sustained. Conclusion 139. In the light of the above discussion, all the appeals are allowed and the of the Special Court for CBI cases convicting the H A. SRINIVASULU v. THE STATE REP. BY THE INSPECTOR OF 73 POLICE [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] appellants for various offences and the of the High Court A confirming the same are set aside. The appellants are acquitted of all the charges.
