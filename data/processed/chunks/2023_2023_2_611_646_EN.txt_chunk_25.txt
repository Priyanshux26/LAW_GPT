vs. State of Maharashtra (supra); State Bank of India vs. Surya Narain Tripathi, 2014 (15) SCC 739. The appointments must follow the stipulations made in the policy. It is therefore a no-brainer that in the absence of a policy governing compassionate appointment to posts under a local authority, no G appointment could be made to such an authority on compassionate grounds. Having held that Circular Nos. 301-Emp, 302-Emp and 303-Emp. cannot be held to be applicable to local authorities, we are unable to affirm the findings of the Division Bench of the High Court to the effect H 646 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A that given that Circular No. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303 Emp. were not specifically withdrawn, they would continue to remain applicable and therefore, compassionate appointment in respect of municipalities would be governed by the scheme under Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302- Emp. and 303-Emp. B We are further of the view that the liberty granted to the local authorities in Circular No. 142-Emp. to formulate their own scheme for compassionate appointment, is an acknowledgement of the fact that there was no policy existing to govern compassionate appointment to posts under local authorities. C 16.5. In fine, the present appeals succeed on two counts: first, there was no policy existing to govern compassionate appointment to posts under local authorities in the State of West Bengal and hence, in the absence of such a policy, compassionate appointment cannot be granted; second, assuming that there was such a policy, it would be of no redeeming purpose to direct that the applications for appointment on D compassionate grounds be considered and decided several years after they were filed. 17. In light of the aforesaid discussion, the instant appeals succeed in the following terms: i. The impugned and common of the High E Court of Calcutta dated 30th September, 2019 is hereby set aside.
