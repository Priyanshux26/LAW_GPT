1. 11. In Usha Sinha vs. Dina Ram2 this Court held that the doctrine of lis pendens applies to an alienation during the pendency of the suit whether such alienees had or had no notice of the pending proceedings. The following has been held I paras 18 & 23: “18. Before one-and-half century, in Bellamy v. Sabine [(1857) 1 De G & J 566 : 44 ER 842], Lord Cranworth, L.C. proclaimed that where a litigation is pending between 2 [2008] 4 SCR 1192 : (2008) 7 SCC 144 908 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports a plaintiff and a defendant as to the right to a particular estate, the necessities of mankind require that the decision of the court in the suit shall be binding not only on the litigating parties, but also on those who derive title under them by alienations made pending the suit, whether such alienees had or had not notice of the pending proceedings. If this were not so, there could be no certainty that the litigation would ever come to an end. 23. It is thus settled law that a purchaser of suit property during the pendency of litigation has no right to resist or obstruct execution of decree passed by a competent court. The doctrine of “lis pendens” prohibits a party from dealing with the property which is the subject-matter of suit. “Lis pendens” itself is treated as constructive notice to a purchaser that he is bound by a decree to be entered in the pending suit. Rule 102, therefore, clarifies that there should not be resistance or obstruction by a transferee pendente lite. It declares that if the resistance is caused or obstruction is offered by a transferee pendente lite of the -debtor, he cannot seek benefit of Rules 98 or 100 of 21.” 12. This Court in Sanjay Verma vs. Manik Roy3 was dealing with a suit for specific performance. During pendency of the suit, a temporary injunction was granted in favour of the plaintiff and different portions of the suit land were sold whereafter the purchasers applied for impleadment, which was rejected by the Trial Court but allowed by the High Court against which special leave to appeal was filed. In the above background, this Court observed the following in para 12: “12. The principles specified in Section 52 of the TP Act are in accordance with equity, good conscience or justice because they rest upon an equitable and just foundation that it will be impossible to bring an action or suit to a successful termination if alienations are permitted to prevail. A transferee pendente lite is bound by the decree just as much as he was a party to the suit. The principle of lis pendens embodied in Section 52 of the TP Act being a 3 [2006] Supp. 10 SCR 469 : (2006) 13 SCC 608 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 909 Shingara Singh v. Daljit Singh & Anr. principle of public policy, no question of good faith or bona fide arises.
