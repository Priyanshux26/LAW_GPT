128 sale deed dated 21.04.1979 executed by the second B defendant in favour of the plaintiff, even-after noting the finding of the First Appellate Court that as relates the sale of one acre of land under Ext.128 sale deed the second defendant did not have any grievance and then, observing, in tune with the same, that the second defendant did not dispute that he sold one acre of land to the plaintiff as per Ext.128 sale deed for the consideration C of Rs. 3000/- and had shown readiness and willingness to deliver the possession of it to the plaintiff. To make matters worse, the High Court failed to consider the crucial issue whether the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the suit land on the strength of the registered Ext.128 sale deed executed by the defendants. D [Para 30][197-A-G] 1.9 The decision of the High Court on the validity of the sale transaction covered under the sale deed dated 04.07.1978 executed by the second defendant in favour of the first defendant, in terms of the provisions under the Fragmentation Act (when E that question was not legally available to be considered in the subject suit) and the virtual declaration of the said sale as void, are absolutely unsustainable. It is the product of erroneous assumption of jurisdiction and also erroneous and perverse appreciation of evidence. It being the foundation for holding the registered sale deed dated 21.04.1979 (Ext.128) as void under F Sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the Fragmentation Act, it is unsustainable.

True that the second defendant H 180 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A contended that it was executed as a collateral security for a money lending transaction. Evidently, the High Court did not frame the validity of the sale deed dated 04.07.1978 executed by the second defendant in favour of the first defendant as a question of law though the trial court also arrived at a finding on this issue without framing it as a specific issue. The indisputable fact is that the B said sale deed dated 04.07.1978 was admittedly, executed and registered about nine (9) months prior to the execution and registration of Ext. 128 sale deed. Ext. 128 would reveal that it involves the entire extent of 3 acres 20 guntas in Survey No. 20/ 2 of G village and the first defendant is also an executant of the C same. The observation and finding of the High Court in the first limb of paragraph 24 of the impugned that the second defendant did not dispute the sale of one acre of land to the plaintiff as per Ext.
