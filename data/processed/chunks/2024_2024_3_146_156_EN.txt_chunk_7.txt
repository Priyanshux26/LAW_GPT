15. Rule 5 provides that every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied in the written statement shall be taken to be admitted by the defendant. What this rule says is, that any allegation of fact must either be denied specifically or by a necessary implication or there should be at least a statement that the fact is not admitted. If the plea is not taken in that manner, then the allegation shall be taken to be admitted.” 15.6. We have made the aforesaid observations as regularly this Court is faced with the situation where there are no specific para-wise reply given in the written statement/counter affidavit filed by the defendant(s)/respondent(s). In our opinion, if the aforesaid correction is made, it may streamline the working. 16. For the reasons mentioned above, we do not find any merit in the present appeal. The same is, accordingly, dismissed. Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey Result of the case: Appeal dismissed.
