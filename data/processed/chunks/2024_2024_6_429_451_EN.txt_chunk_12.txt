Therefore, according to him, Rule 27 prescribes an altogether new punishment which is not contemplated by the CRPF Act. Hence, according to him, Rule 27 to that extent is ultra vires the CRPF Act and as such void. 24. To determine whether the punishment of compulsory retirement prescribed in Rule 27 is ultra vires the CRPF Act, it would be apposite to first examine the scope of rule-making power conferred on the Central Government by the statute. The CRPF Act, vide sub-section (1) of Section 18, grant the power to make rules in general terms, that is, “to carry out the purposes of this Act”. And, vide sub-section (2) of Section 18, “in particular and without prejudice to the generality 446 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the foregoing power”, to make rules for all or any of the matters enumerated therein. Interpreting such a rule-making provision, in State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Lakhwinder Kumar and Ors.14, a two-Judge Bench of this Court, relying on a Constitution Bench decision in Rohtak & Hissar Districts Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P. & Ors.15, held: “23. In our opinion, when the power is conferred in general and thereafter in respect of enumerated matters, as in the present case, the particularization in respect of specified subject is construed as merely illustrative and does not limit the scope of general power. Reference in this connection can be made to a decision of this Court in Rohtak and Hissar Districts Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of UP, in which it has been held as follows: “18……… Section 15 (1) confers wide powers on the appropriate government to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act; and Section 15 (2) specifies some of the matters enumerated by clauses (a) to (e) in respect of which rules may be framed. It is well settled that the enumeration of the particular matters by sub-section (2) will not control or limit the width of the powers conferred on the appropriate government by sub-section (1) of Section 15; and so, if it appears that the item added by the appropriate government has relation to conditions of employment, its addition cannot be challenged as being invalid in law.” (Emphasis supplied) This would imply that the intention of the legislature, as indicated in the enabling Act, must be the prime guide to the extent of delegate’s power to make rules. However, the delegate must not travel wider than the object of the legislature rather it must remain true to it16. 14 [2013] 2 SCR 1070 : (2013) 6 SCC 333 15 [1966] 2 SCR 863 : AIR 1966 SC 1471 16 Dr. Mahachandra Prasad Singh v.
