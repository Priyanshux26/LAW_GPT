Bains v. State (UT of Chandigarh) (1980) 4 SCC 631 wherein it was held that after receipt of the police report under Section 173, the Magistrate has three options: (H.S. Bains case (supra) “6. …. (1) he may decide that there is no suffi cient ground for proceeding further and drop action; (2) he may take cognizance of the off ence under Section 190(1)(b) on the basis of the police report and issue process; this he may do without being bound in any manner by the conclusion arrived at by the police in their 1 (2014) 13 SCC 133 720 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. report; (3) he may take cognizance of the off ence under Section 190(1)(a) on the basis of the original complaint and proceed to examine upon oath the complainant and his witnesses under Section 200. If he adopts the third alternative, he may hold or direct an inquiry under Section 202 if he thinks fi t. Thereafter he may dismiss the complaint or issue process, as the case may be.” The second and third options available to the Magistrate as laid down in H.S. Bains (supra) has been referred to and relied upon in subsequent decisions of this Court to approve the action of the Magistrate in accepting the fi nal report and at the same time in proceeding to treat either the police report or the initial complaint as the basis for further action/enquiry in the matter of the allegations levelled therein. Reference in this regard may be made to the decision of this Court in Gangadhar Janardan Mhatre v. State of Maharashtra (2004) 7 SCC 768. The following view may be specifi cally noted: “9. ….The Magistrate can ignore the conclusion arrived at by the investigating offi cer and independently apply his mind to the facts emerging from the investigation and take cognizance of the case, if he thinks fi t, exercise his powers under Section 190(1)(b) and direct the issue of process to the accused. The Magistrate is not bound in such a situation to follow the procedure laid down in Sections 200 and 202 of the Code for taking cognizance of a case under Section 190(1)(a) though it is open to him to act under Section 200 or Section 202 also. [See India Carat (P) Ltd. v. State of Karnataka, (1989) 2 SCC 132]” (SCC P. 140, Para 16).” 11. In view of the above, there remains no shadow of doubt that on the receipt of the police report under Section 173 Cr.P.C., the Magistrate can exercise three options. Firstly, he may decide that there is no suffi cient ground for proceeding further and drop action. Secondly, he may take cognizance of the off ence under Section 190(1)(b) on the basis of the police report and issue process; and thirdly, he may take cognizance of the off ence under Section 190(1)(a) on the basis of the original complaint and proceed to examine upon oath the complainant and his witnesses under Section 200.
