[2023] 6 S.C.R. 281 281 COMMISSSIONER OF CUSTOMS, CENTRAL EXCISE AND A SERVICE TAX, HYDERABAD v. ASHWANI HOMEO PHARMACY (Civil Appeal No. 9525 of 2018) B MAY 03, 2023 [DINESH MAHESHWARI AND VIKRAM NATH, JJ.] Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985: Chapter 30, First Schedule, Tariff Item 3003 90 14 – Product “Aswini Homeo Arnica Hair Oil” C – Classification of, as ‘medicament’ under Tariff Item 3003 90 14 in Chapter 30 or as ‘cosmetic or toilet preparations’ under Tariff Item 3305 90 19 in Chapter 33 – Held: Product Aswini Homeo Arnica Hair Oil merits classification as ‘medicament’ under Chapter 30 and not as ‘cosmetic or toilet preparations’ under Chapter 33 – On D basis of the twin test-common parlance test as also the ingredients test, it is rightly held to be medicament – Furthermore, when the said product is intended to control hair fall, prevent dandruff and to induce good sleep, which all carry their own therapeutic and prophylactic connotations, the picture of a lady with long black flowing hair cannot make the product a cosmetic one – Change in E tariff structure by way of amendment brought about in the year 2012 did not justify a re-look into the classification of the product – Mere broad-basing of the entries in Chapter 30 and Chapter 33 of the First Schedule to the Act 1985, by itself, could not have been the justification for an attempt at re-classification of the product. F Dismissing the appeal, the Court HELD: 1. The product Aswini Homeo Arnica Hair Oil- AHAHO, merits classification as ‘medicament’ under Chapter 30 and not as ‘cosmetic or toilet preparations’ under Chapter 33 G of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985; and the change in tariff structure by way of amendment brought about in the year 2012 did not justify any re-look at the classification of the product in question. [Para 34][353-F-G] H 281 282 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 2.1 As regards the question as to whether the product, Aswini Homeo Arnica Hair Oil-AHAHO, merits classification as ‘medicament’ under Chapter 30 or as ‘cosmetic or toilet preparations’ under Chapter 33, the inquiry shall be directed towards a couple of tests taken together, being the common/ commercial parlance test i.e., how the product is understood B commonly, including by the persons dealing in the same and by the end- users; and the ingredients test i.e., whether the ingredients used in the product are found mentioned in authoritative textbooks. The connotations of common parlance test could further be understood, that the primary object of such C taxing statute being to raise revenue and various products being differently classified for that purpose, the entries are not to be understood in their scientific and technical meaning; rather the terms and expressions used in tariff have to be understood by their popular meaning, that is the meaning attached to them by those dealing with or using the product. Further, the words and D expressions, unless defined in the statute have to be construed in the sense in which persons dealing with them understand i.e., as per trade understanding and usage.
