Further, it was held that the workmen and employees are entitled to a liquidation value of Rs. 113 Crore instead of Rs. 52 Crore as contemplated in the Resolution Plan. The NCLAT directed the Chairman of the Monitoring Committee (the erstwhile Resolution Professional) to compute the payments to be made to the workmen and employees within one month and to communicate the same to the SRA. The RP had arrived at a figure of Rs. 226.6 Crore which comprised of Rs. 14 Crore towards Provident Fund dues, Rs. 188.2 Crore towards Gratuity dues and Rs. 24.4 Crore towards damages for non-payment of Provident Fund. 136. The SRA sought a clarification of the aforesaid before the NCLAT and vide dated 02.12.2022, it was made clear that the cost of paying the unpaid amount towards the Provident Fund and Gratuity to the workmen and employees has to be borne by the SRA. The same cannot be paid out of the amounts reserved for the other creditors of the Corporate Debtor on a pro-rata basis subject to a maximum of Rs. 475 Crore as stated in Clause 6.4.2(e) of the Resolution Plan since that was a contemplation pertaining to the liquidation value only and not for the dues relating to Provident [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2145 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. Fund and Gratuity. An appeal against the dated 21.10.2022 was dismissed by this Court vide dated 30.01.2023. Therefore, there was no scope left for the SRA to avoid payment of the Provident Fund and Gratuity dues to the workmen and employees. Such an obligation was in addition to the payment of minimum liquidation value that the workmen/employees were entitled to under the terms of the Resolution Plan. 137. The SRA had filed IA Nos. 3789-3790 of 2023 in the Company Appeal on 16.06.2023 praying that the Gratuity Claims be allowed to be paid in three tranches i.e., within 3, 4 and 5 years from the Closing Date. The SRA also sought leave from the NCLAT to approach the EPFO Authorities under Section 14B to seek a reduction or waiver of the damages of Rs. 24.4 crore imposed on the Corporate Debtor and to also pursue an appeal against the of the EPFO Authorities directing the SRA to pay the damages. Subsequently, on 18.08.2023, the SRA filed two other IAs 3801-3802 of 2023 in the Company Appeal, praying that, in case the previous IA relating to the Gratuity and Provident Fund Claims is not allowed, then the Resolution Plan cannot be implemented under Section 30(2)(e) and as a consequence, the Lenders be directed to refund all amounts invested or infused into the Corporate Debtor by the SRA. 138. The NCLAT in its impugned has taken note of its own dated 21.10.2022 but has, however, only allowed the upfront payment of the Provident Fund dues of Rs. 12 Crore to the workmen and employees along with the payments that they are entitled to under the Resolution Plan.
