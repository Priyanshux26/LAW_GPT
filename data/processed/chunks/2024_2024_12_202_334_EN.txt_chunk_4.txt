[Paras 120-122, 125, 129, 130] Customs Act, 1962 – s.28 (11) – Recovery of duties not levied or short-levied or erroneously refunded – Constitutional validity of s.28(11) – Introduction of s.28(11) vide the Validation Act of 2011 which retrospectively validates the show cause notices issued u/s.28 with effect from 06.07.2011, if discriminatory and arbitrary for not curing the defect highlighted in Sayed Ali’s case and, thus, violative of Art.14 of the Constitution of India: Held: s.28(11) is constitutionally valid and its application is not limited to the period between 08.04.2011 and 16.09.2011 – None of the changes made by the amendments to s.28 has any impact on the competence of the proper officer for the purposes of fulfilment of functions u/s.28 – Only major change that warrants the clarification provided under Explanation 2 is the distinction with respect to the limitation period for the issuance of show cause notices – Thus, the application of sub-section (11), which pertains only to the empowerment of proper officers to issue show cause notices u/s.28, cannot be said to be limited only to new s.28 but also to the provision as it stood prior to 08.04.2011 – Legislative intent is that sub-section (11) was meant to apply to s.28 without [2024] 12 S.C.R. 209 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. any restriction as to time – Enactment of sub-section (11) of s.28 cures the defect pointed out in Sayed Ali’s case. [Paras 147, 148, 151, 154, 155] Customs Act, 1962 – ss.17 and 28 – Proper officer to issue show cause notice in terms of s.28 – by the High Court in the case of Mangali Impex’, if expounds the correct interpretation of s.28(11): Held: High Court in Mangali Impex’s case observed that s.28(11) could not be said to have cured the defect pointed out in Sayed Ali’s case as the possibility of chaos and confusion would continue to subsist despite the introduction of the said section with retrospective effect – High Court declined to give retrospective operation to s.28(11) for the period prior to 08.04.2011 by harmoniously construing it with Explanation 2 to s.28 of the 1962 Act – Decision in Mangali Impex’s case failed to take into account the policy being followed by the Customs department since 1999 which provides for the exclusion of jurisdiction of all other proper officers once a show cause notice by a particular proper officer is issued – It could be said that this policy provides a sufficient safeguard against the apprehension of the issuance of multiple show cause notices to the same assessee u/s.28 – Further, the High Court could not have applied the doctrine of harmonious construction to harmonise s.28(11) with Explanation 2 because s.28(11) and Explanation 2 operate in two distinct fields and no inherent contradiction can be said to exist between the two – Thus, the decision in Mangali Impex’s case set aside. [Para 168] Finance Act, 2022 – s.97, Amendments made by Finance Act – Constitutional validity of ss.86, 87, 88, 94 and 97 – s.97 which retrospectively validates the show cause notices with effect from 01.04.2023, if manifestly arbitrary and thus, violative of Art.14 of the Constitution of India: Held: s.97 which, inter-alia, retrospectively validated all show cause notices issued u/s.28 of the Act, 1962 cannot be said to be unconstitutional – It cannot be said that s.97 fails to cure the defect pointed out in Canon India’s case nor is it manifestly arbitrary and discriminatory and is not disproportional to the object sought to be achieved by it.
