Therefore, the State Legislature did not possess any legislative competence with respect to goods other than those included in the new and limited Entry 54 either on the date of the Ordinance i.e., 17.06.2017, or on the date of the Amendment Act, i.e., 02.12.2017. 58. The Telangana VAT Act 2005, was eff ectively repealed from 01.07.2017 by Section 174(1)(i) of the TGST Act 2017 except in respect of goods included in Entry 54 of List II. Section 174(1) operates as an express acknowledgment and acceptance of the 101st Amendment. Therefore, the TVAT Amendment of 02.12.2017 applicable to all goods cannot be made after such repeal. 59. Article 246A embodies the principle of simultaneous levy by both Parliament and the State Legislature and is distinct from the principle of concurrence. Article 246A creates both the power and the subject matter of legislation. This makes it distinct from a concurrent power of legislation u/a 246(2) which requires one to travel to List III, Schedule VIl to fi nd the subject matters with respect to which the power may be exercised. When concurrence as a principle already exists in such a manner, the decision of the Parliament to house both the power and the subject matter in a single article of the Constitution, i.e., Article 246A, leads to the conclusion that such power is to be exercised simultaneously by the Parliament and the State and cannot be exercised independently as they do under the provisions of Article 246(3). 176 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 60. Therefore, the State Legislature can only exercise its taxing powers with respect to goods and services either under Article 246A, which is to be exercised along with the Parliament, or under Article 246(3) r/w amended Entry 54 only with respect to the six items mentioned therein. 61. It is argued on behalf of the assesses of Maharashtra that the High Court proceeded erroneously to uphold the state’s power to legislate with respect to its extant sales tax laws, in this case,the Maharashtra VAT Act, 2002. The High Court failed to appreciate that Article 246-A has no relation whatsoever to the earlier sales tax laws as it specifi cally deals with GST, which was specifi cally defi ned under the Constitution to mean a tax on the “supply of goods and services”. Applying the pith and substance test, the phrase “goods and services tax” referred to in Article246-A is totally diff erent and distinct from the earlier tax levied on the sale of goods by the State Legislature. 62. Further, it is submitted that GST is a tax on “supply”. Supply is the new taxable event, as opposed to as opposed to the taxable events existing prior to the 101stConstitution Amendment Act. The mere fact that the word “supply” has been defi ned under the GST Acts to cover the manufacture, service and sale, for the purpose of levy and assessment of GST, does not mean that the legislative competence of the State Legislature should also be construed widely relying on the defi nitions meant for the purposes of the GST Acts and not the Constitution of India.
