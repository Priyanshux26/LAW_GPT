272”), under Article 370(1) of the Constitution of India with the concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu & Kashmir (through the Governor, as the powers of the Government of the State vested in the Governor at that time). Article 367(4) was inserted in the Constitution of India in that process, and Article 367(4)(d) in eff ect amended sub-clause (3) Article 370 of the Constitution of India, by replacing the expression ‘Constituent Assembly of the State’ with ‘Legislative Assembly of the State’. This happened at 11:00 a.m. approximately. 37. At 11:15 a.m., two statutory resolutions, viz., a Statutory Resolution regarding cessation of all clauses of Article 370 except clause (1), and a Statutory Resolution regarding the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill, 2019, were introduced in the Rajya Sabha. The Reorganisation Bill provided for reorganising the existing State of Jammu & Kashmir into two Union Territories – one of Jammu and Kashmir and the other of Ladakh, comprising territories of the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir, namely Kargil and Leh Districts. The said Bill further clarifi ed that there was to be a Legislative Assembly for the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir. At 5:30 p.m., the Statutory Resolution in respect of the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill, 2019 was passed by the Lok Sabha, by way of a voice vote. It may be noted that pursuant to the Presidential Proclamation dated 19.12.2018, Parliament was exercising the powers of the State Legislative Assembly, in its absence. 38. Soon thereafter, the Resolution regarding cessation of all clauses of Article 370, except clause (1) and the Statutory Resolution regarding the reorganisation of the State of Jammu & Kashmir was passed by the Rajya Sabha, and on the next day by the Lok Sabha. We are informed that IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 323 [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] these Resolutions were, in fact, passed by 2/3 majority of the Members present and voting, both of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. 39.

It is the case of the petitioners that, eff ectively, this endeavour emasculated Article 370 without formally abolishing it using the route of a constitutional amendment. 40. On 9.8.2019, upon receiving the assent of the President of India, in exercise of powers under Section 2(a) of the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as “the said Act”), the respondent, through the Ministry of Home Aff airs, issued a notifi cation bearing number SO 2889 (E), for provisions of the said Act to come into force, w.e.f. 31.10.2019. 41. This is what has resulted in the batch of petitions. 42. The other development has been that in pursuance of the aforesaid, on 31.10.2019, the two Union Territories were carved out and President’s Rule was revoked. The Challenge 43. A clutch of writ petitions have been fi led in the present case.
