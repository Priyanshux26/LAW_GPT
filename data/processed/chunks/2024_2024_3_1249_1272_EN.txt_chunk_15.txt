29. The Ministry has filed an additional affidavit dated 18th July 2023, and reliance has been placed on the guidelines for sand mining. As far as item 6 is concerned, in the counter affidavit, reliance was placed on the Office Memorandum dated 8th August 2022, purportedly issued in terms of the directions issued in paragraph 9 of the impugned . It records that item 6 shall be subject to the SOP attached to the said Office Memorandum. We have perused the said SOP. We find that the SOP creates no regulatory machinery to ensure the implementation of the terms of the SOP. The SOP does 1272 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports not refer to item 6 at all; it merely refers to the activities relating to the identification to borrow areas to obtain earth or soil materials. It does not refer to extracting ordinary earth for linear projects, such as roads, pipelines, etc. Therefore, the said SOP can hardly be said to be in terms of what the NGT ed the Central Government to do in terms of paragraphs 8 and 9. 30. We are not entertaining a challenge to item 7 of the impugned notification. As none of the respondents have challenged the impugned notification, they will have to implement the directions issued in terms of paragraph 9 of the impugned regarding item 7. 31. Thus, notwithstanding the specific directions issued in paragraph 8 read with paragraph 9 of the impugned , no safeguards have been provided, such as laying down processes, the mode and the manner of excavation and quantum. 32. Therefore, we have no hesitation in striking down item 6 of the substituted Appendix-IX forming part of the impugned notification dated 28th March 2020 and item 6 of the amended impugned notification dated 30th August 2023. Accordingly, we quash item 6 in the two notifications above. 33. The appeals are, accordingly, partly allowed on above terms. There will be no as to costs.
