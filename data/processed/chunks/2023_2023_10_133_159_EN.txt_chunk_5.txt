The DGFT thereafter proceeded to allocate specific quantities of RPC out of a total import 2 Notification No 42/2015-20 H 140 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A quantity of 1.4 million MT which was to be imported by each calciner on the basis of actual production capacity. 5. While so, on 26.11.2018, a public notice3 was issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, stipulating the manner in which DGFT would allocate the quota of RPC to eligible CPC manufacturing B units within the given ceiling limit. According to this, eligible units wishing to avail of quota had to apply for an import license with a copy to the jurisdictional regional authority of DGFT along with the capacity of the unit as well as the consent certificate from the State Pollution Control Board in the name of the industrial unit user indicating the quantity permitted for import and its use. On 27.12.2018, the DGFT, in furtherance C of the first public notice initiated the process for allocating RPC. Its allocation became the subject matter of controversy by Sanvira as well as Rain CII, the respondent contesting in these proceedings. Sanvira contended that its production capacity was 330,000 MTPA which was not taken into account while providing allocation. The Committee disposed D of all these representations, not acceding to the request. Aggrieved, Sanvira, filed an application, being I.A.No. 12291/2019 in the proceedings in M.C. Mehta’s Case before this court. The application specifically contended that in September 2017, Sanvira initiated Phase-2 expansion to expand the capacity from 2,00,000 MTPA to 3,30,000 MTPA and Phase-2 expansion was completed in October 2018 and that a consent E to operate was received from the AP Pollution Control Board on 29.11.2018. 6.
