In any case, there was no pressing urgency for picking new vacancies for the selection year 2013, after the selection was over and result had been announced. 12. Be that as it may, in the case at hand, consequent to the joint meeting and the decision taken therein the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) vide his letter dated 25.11.2013 wrote to the Secretary Public Service Commission as under: - “……………….. 624 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. I am directed to refer to the letter No. 3-50/2012-PSC(E-1) dated 11th October, 2013 on the subject cited above and to say that as per this Department requisition 8 (eight) posts of Civil Judge (Jr. Division)-cum-JMIC has been recommended by the Commission. In the meantime, 2 (two) additional post of (Jr. Division)-cum-JMIC has been created for Civil Court at Solan and Amb (Una). Besides, one Civil Judge-(Jr. Division)-cum-JMIC, Amit was dismissed from the Government service on 19.09.2013. As such three more posts of (Jr. Division) have become available in the Department. As per his letter No. HHC/GAZ/14-49/74-VI-30012 dated 30th October, 2013 (photocopy enclosed for ready reference) the Registrar General, H.P. High Court has informed that roster point 55, 56 & 11 were not included in the previous requisition of the posts to be notifi ed during the year 2013 by the Registry of Hon’ble High Court. Keeping in view of above position you are requested to sponsor three more candidates from the select list against roster point 55, 56 & 11 from the unreserved category at the earliest.” 13. Ultimately, however, only two names from the general category who were next in the of merit were made available for the select list which were of Vivek Kaisth and Akansha Dogra (appellants before this Court), who were recommended for appointment as Civil Judge (Jr. Division) by the State Public Service Commission. Appointment letters were thereafter issued to the appellants on 27.12.2013 and they were appointed as Civil Judge (Jr. Division) under the general category. The two appellants were then sent for training in the judicial academy. The Himachal Pradesh High Court subsequently posted them as Civil Judge (Jr. Division) in diff erent districts. After completing their period of probation and having completed around 9 years of service as Civil Judge (Jr. Division), both the appellants have also been promoted to the next higher post of Civil Judge (Sr. Division), which was done on 23.03.2023. 14. The fi rst question which comes to our mind is whether the directions of the Himachal Pradesh High Court in Shweta Dhingra (supra), were at all in line with the decision of this Court in Malik Mazhar Sultan (3) and VIVEK KAISTH & ANR v. THE STATE OF HIMACHAL 625 PRADESH & ORS [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] Another v. U.P. Public Service Commission and Others (2008) 17 SCC 703 (hereafter referred to as “Malik Mazhar”). We will discuss that in a while, but since at the root of it all lies the directions given by this court in Malik Mazhar, it would be necessary at this stage to refer to this decision of the Apex Court in to get a clear perspective of the matter.
