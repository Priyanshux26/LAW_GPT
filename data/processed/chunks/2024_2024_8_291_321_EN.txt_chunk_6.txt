The exchange rate on this date was 1 euro = Rs. 59.17. While the arbitral award along with interest was euros 16,73,469.07, the deposited amount of Rs. 7.5 crores gets converted to euros 12,67,534.22 at that exchange rate, and the balance of the award would be euros 4,05,934.85 that remained pending as on this date. Subsequently, pursuant to the High Court’s interim dated 03.06.2011 in revision against the Trial Court dismissing the objections petition, the appellant deposited an additional amount of Rs. 50 lakhs on 15.07.2011. As on this date, the amount of arbitral award including interest pending payment was euros 4,17,278.78, i.e., after converting and adjusting the earlier deposit against the award. Using the prevailing exchange rate of 1 euro = Rs. 62.89 as on 15.07.2011, the appellant’s deposit amounts to euros 79,503.90. Therefore, a balance of euros 3,37,774.88, along with interest, remains pending for which the exchange rate as on 01.07.2014 would apply. 3.1 Mr. Mishra concluded by submitting that the appellants would be required to pay only Rs. 3.19 crores if their calculation is accepted. On the other hand, if the impugned is upheld, they would be required to be pay more than double the amount, i.e., Rs. 6.48 crores. 3.2 Mr. Abhay Mahajan, learned counsel, appearing for the respondent submitted that the exchange rate on 01.07.2014 would apply to the entire award amount. He submitted that the respondent had not consented to the deposit of Rs. 7.5 300 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports crores and that the High Court did not convert the amount but only directed deposit of a lump sum amount. He relied on this Court’s decision in P.S.L. Ramanathan Chettiar v. O.R.M.P.R.M. Ramanathan Chettiar10 where it was held that the debtor depositing a sum in court during the pendency of the appeal does not pass the title and vest the money with the decree-holder. The decree-holder may withdraw the amount only on furnishing security, which means that the payment is not in satisfaction of the decree. Further, the debtor can proceed against the security in case he succeeds in the appeal. Rather, the purpose of the deposit is to obtain a stay of execution and to put the money beyond the reach of the parties pending the disposal of the appeal. On this basis, Mr. Mahajan submitted that the deposit of Rs. 8 crores during the pendency of the objections under Section 48 does not pass the title of this amount to the respondent and such deposit was not under the arbitral award as the award can be deemed to be a decree only on 01.07.2014 when all the objections to the award stood dismissed. Hence, this is the relevant date for conversion. 3.3 As per the calculation sheet submitted by the respondent, the exchange rate as on this date is 1 euro = Rs. 82.21 and this rate must be used for converting the entire arbitral award and interest. The amount of Rs. 11.6 crores withdrawn by the respondent on 10.10.2016 must first be appropriated towards interest and then towards the principal sum.
