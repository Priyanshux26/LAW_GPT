It is submitted that therefore if the Legislature wanted to apply the provisions of Section 140A, they would have expressly stated so. The B very fact that there is no provision in Chapter XIV-B for applying provision of Section 140A, clearly shows that Legislature never intended to apply the provisions of Section 140A before 01.06.1999. This was also made clear in the memorandum explaining the Finance Bill, 1999, by saying that there is no corresponding provision in Chapter XIV-B for payment C of self-assessment tax at the time of filing the return. It is submitted that therefore interest under Section 158BFA is leviable on stand-alone basis for non-filing of return which ceases on the day return is filed. It is submitted that said provision is similar to Section 234A. 7.10 It is submitted that in the impugned and the D High Court has explained the rationale behind introduction of Section 158BC in Section 140A and has specifically held that “the liability of payment of interest does not stop merely on filing of return but it is attracted in terms of Section 140A in payment of tax in terms of Section and even now the provision of Section 158BFA(1) and 140A operate independently”. It is submitted that in view of the same, the submission E on behalf of assessee to refute its liability to pay interest under Section 158BFA deserves to be negatived. 7.11 Now insofar as the levy of surcharge under proviso to Section 113 of the Income Tax Act is concerned Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG appearing for revenue has fairly conceded that the said issue has been F decided in favour of the assessee in terms of the decision of this Court in the case of Vatika Township Private Limited (supra). 8. Heard the learned counsels appearing on behalf of the respective parties at length. The questions of law posed for the consideration of this Court in the present appeals are:(i) levy of interest G under Section 158BFA(1) of the Income Tax Act for late filing of the return for the block period in absence of any notice under Section 158BC of the Act and for the period prior to 01.06.1999? and (ii) the levy of the surcharge under proviso to Section 113 of the Income Tax Act. 9. Now insofar as the levy of the surcharge under proviso to H Section 113 of the Income Tax Act is concerned, the said issue is now K.L. SWAMY v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX & 705 ANR. [M. R. SHAH, J.] not res integra in view of the decision of this Court in the case of Vatika A Township Private Limited (supra). In paragraphs 37 to 40, 44 and 45, it is observed and held as under: “Answer to the reference 37. When we examine the insertion of the proviso in Section 113 B of the Act, keeping in view the aforesaid principles, our irresistible conclusion is that the intention of the legislature was to make it prospective in nature.
