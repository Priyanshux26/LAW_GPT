Whereas, in the appeals and applications filed by the landowners, it was enhanced to INR 340 per sq. yd. A. Facts 3. The present controversy has a chequered history. The acquisition process was initiated by State of U.P./NOIDA on 05.01.1991 through a notification issued under Section 4(1) of the 1894 Act, for the acquisition of approximately 492 acres of land in Village Chhalera Bangar, intended for planned Industrial Development. Afterwards, on 07.01.1992, the government issued a declaration under Section 6 read in conjunction with the ‘urgency clause’ contained in Section 17 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 449 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. Harnand Singh (Deceased) through LRs & Ors. of the 1894 Act. Possession of the land was taken on 30.03.1992, 07.08.1995 and 18.11.1995. 4. Subsequently, on 17.08.1996, the Land Acquisition Officer (hereinafter, ‘LAO’) issued an award under Section 11 of the 1894 Act, affixing compensation at INR 110 per sq. yd. The LAO relied on a sale deed dated 16.12.1988, whereby one Jyoti Prasad had sold the land to G.R. Pant at a rate of INR 125 per sq. yd. Applying a further 12% deduction, owing to the large area under acquisition, the rate of compensation was finally determined at INR 110 per sq. yd. 5. Following the award, several landowners made a reference before the Reference Court seeking enhancement of compensation under Section 18 of the 1894 Act. The record indicates two kinds of compensation rates granted by the Reference Court: first, INR 233 and second, INR 222 per square yard. In both these awards, the evidence suggested the market value of the land at the relevant time, at INR 390 per sq. yd., upon which a 40% deduction for development was applied. However, the final figure achieved after this calculation has been noted differently in both s, where INR 222 per square yard seems to be the result of a calculation error. 6. Some landowners further preferred appeals before the High Court. One such initiative was filed by Jagdish Singh etc., who challenged the Reference Court’s award in First Appeal No. 774/2001, titled Jagdish Chandra and others v. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority. The High Court through its judgement dated 14.12.2007, reversed the deductions made by the Reference Court from the assessed market value and directed the State / NOIDA authorities to recalculate the compensation at INR 297.50 per sq. yd. without deducting development charges. However, in another similar group of appeals, the High Court, vide the later judgement dated 09.05.2008, refused to enhance the compensation. 7. The landowners’ review application(s) against the dated 09.05.2008 were dismissed by the High Court observing that they could independently file appeals, if so aggrieved. However, in response to a later application seeking clarification, the High Court on 19.05.2010 clarified the operative part of its earlier and enhanced the compensation to INR 340 per sq. yd. The other alike appeals filed by similarly situated landowners 450 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports were also allowed in part and the compensation was enhanced to INR 340 per sq.
