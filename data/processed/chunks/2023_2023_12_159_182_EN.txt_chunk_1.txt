[Paras 21, 27, 34 and 35] LOONKARAN GANDHI (D) THR. LR. v. 161 STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND ORS. Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936 – s. 67 – Award of tribunal how to be determined – Acquisition of land under NIT Act – Determination of compensation – Passing of an award – Applicability of the said provisions of the LA Act: Held: s. 67 makes it clear that for determining the compensation and to pass an award, the provisions of the LA Act would be applicable – Thus, LA Act has its application to such extent for land acquired by the NIT subject to the modifi cations made under the NIT Act – Applicability of s. 11 of LA Act which deals with enquiry and award, and s. 16 of LA Act which deals with power of Collector to take possession, even in acquisition under the NIT Act is ‘sine qua non’ – While making an inquiry u/s. 11, the applicability of s. 9 which deals with issuance of notice to persons interested, is an integral procedure in the proceedings – Thus, for determination of compensation to pass an award in case of acquisition of land under NIT Act, the applicability of the said provisions of the LA Act has been duly recognised in s. 67 of the NIT Act. [Para 17] Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936 – Compulsory acquisition of land – Inordinate delay in granting compensation to the land owner from the date of taking over of possession – Duty of the State and the authorities: Held: Eminent domain of the State cannot be doubted – Right of the land owner enshrined u/Art. 300-A and Art. 31-A has been recognized as a human/civil right , thus if any individual is to be divested or deprived of the said right by the State, it ought not be done without giving compensation in accordance with law for the land so acquired for public purpose – While striking a balance between eminent domain of the State and human/civil rights of an individual, an obligation is on the State and its authorities to pass an award within a reasonable time – On compulsory acquisition of land, if the award is not passed within a reasonable time duly compensating such an individual, it would cause grave hardship and it would adversely aff ect the livelihood of the land loser – Delay in determining compensation uproots the land losers, however, to meet the ends of justice and to rationalize the equity, switching the date of market value in determining compensation is found necessary.
