The Investigating Officer conducted an enquiry and filed an Action Taken Report on 09.04.2019 stating that no cognisable offence is made out and in fact, there is no obscenity in the allegedly offending content. 3.2 However, the ACMM, by dated 17.09.2019, allowed the complainant’s application and directed the registration of an FIR against the appellants under Sections 292 and 294 of the IPC and Sections 67 and 67A of the IT Act as the vulgar language used is prima facie capable of appealing to prurient interests of the audience and is hence obscene. 3.3 The appellants filed a revision petition before the Additional Sessions Judge, who by dated 10.11.2020 partially modified the of the ACMM and directed the registration of FIR only under Sections 67 and 67A of the IT Act by relying on the decision of this Court in Sharat Babu Digumarti v. Government (NCT of Delhi)8. 3.4 The appellants then filed a petition under Section 482 CrPC before the High Court for quashing the above-mentioned s, which came to be dismissed by the dated 06.03.2023, impugned herein. Against the dismissal and the consequent direction to register FIR under Sections 67 and 67A of the IT Act, the present appeals are filed by all the accused/appellants. 3.5 Pursuant to the directions of the High Court, an FIR was registered under Sections 67 and 67A of the IT Act against the appellants on 16.04.2023. 4. Reasoning of the High Court: The High Court, while dismissing the petition for quashing, held that the object of Sections 67 and 67A of the IT Act is to punish the publication and transmission of obscene and sexually explicit material in the cyber space. It relied on the ‘community standard test’ to determine whether the material is obscene, as laid 7 ‘IRWP Act’ hereinafter. 8 [2016] 8 SCR 1015 : (2017) 2 SCC 18 : 2016 INSC 1131 1154 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports down by this Court in Aveek Sarkar v. State of West Bengal9 and followed in decisions of various High Courts10. By applying this test, the High Court held as follows: First, applying the standard of a common prudent man, it found that the episode did not use civil language and there was excessive use of profanities and vulgar expletives, and a clear description and reference to sexually explicit acts. The determination of how the content impacts a common man must be determined in the Indian context, as per Indian morality, keeping in mind contemporary standards of civility and morality.11 In the allegedly offending portion (in Season 1, episode 5 from 5:24 to 6:40 minutes and 25:28 to 25:46 minutes), the male protagonist in a conversation with the female protagonist uses terms describing male and female genitalia and sexual acts, thereby making them sexually explicit and arousing prurient feelings. While the female protagonist is heard objecting to the language and expressing disgust over it, she does so by repeating the same to the male protagonist. The male protagonist then uses more vulgar expletives and indecent language, which is repeated by the female protagonist in a later part of the episode.
