Digital Supreme Court Reports child” – Purport of s.2(1)(da) – Section 2(1)(da) is a departure from the existing objective criterion of determination of age in terms of Section 2(1)(d): Held: Neither Section 15 of the POCSO nor Section 2(1)(da) can be interpreted or invoked in isolation from the other – Section 2(1) (da) of the POCSO, made a conscious departure from the already existing objective criterion of determination of age in terms of Section 2(1)(d) which is generally applicable to the POCSO, as the legislature was alive to inherent difficulty posed by such criteria – Section 2(1)(da) of the POCSO was inserted to explicitly define and delineate what type of visual depictions would be considered ‘child pornography’ to remove any ambiguity that existed earlier and more importantly, to mitigate the tendency of the courts to refer and apply the objective criteria of age determination prescribed under Section 2(1)(d) of the POCSO, even when dealing with matters involving child pornography – Thus, the legislature in addition to explaining the contour of visual depiction in Section 2(1)(da) of the POCSO, also specifically added the words “but appear to depict a child” in the end – If the courts while dealing with any matter involving child pornography, continue to refer and rely on Section 2(1)(d) of the POCSO, then the same will frustrate the intention behind Section 2(1)(da), rendering the words “but appear to depict a child” otiose and nugatory – The true purport of Section 2(1)(da) of the POCSO is to ensure that for offences pertaining to child pornography, it is Section 2(1)(da) that is given due regard and not Section 2(1)(d) – Thus, it is the definition of ‘child pornography’ which is of relevance while considering whether Section 15 of the POCSO can be invoked or not. [Paras 139-143] Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – ss.2(1) (d), 2(1)(da)– Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act, 2019 – “child”; “child pornography” – Whether the individual involved is a ‘child’ or not – Determination – “but appear to depict a child”: Held: Under s.2(1)(d), an objective criterion is prescribed based on the age of the individual in question which involves ascertaining and establishing whether he or she is under eighteen years of age, if so, such person would be considered a ‘child’ for the purposes of any offence in respect of such child that is punishable under the POCSO – Further, under the unamended Section 15, there was only one criteria for ascertaining whether the material in [2024] 10 S.C.R. 161 Just Rights for Children Alliance & Anr. v. S. Harish & Ors. question can be regarded as ‘child pornography’ or not, which was by establishing that the material depicts or involves a person who is under the age of eighteen years – “child pornography” was specifically defined after the 2019 Amendment Act meaning any visual depiction of a child involved in any sexually explicit conduct wherein the expression ‘visual depiction’ is inclusive in nature – Further, “but appear to depict a child” lays down the test or criteria for ascertaining, whether any of the mentioned visual depiction is a ‘child pornography’ or not, by prescribing a prima facie subjective satisfaction that the material appears to depict a child – The use of the comma before the words “but appear to depict a child” is significant which is used both as a disjunctive and a conjunctive to the words preceding it – It has been used as a disjunctive to stress, that the subjective criteria that the material in question appears to depict a child is not inextricably linked or limited to just one category of visual depictions i.e., the last category being “image created, adapted, or modified” – At the same time, it has been used as a conjunctive in relation to all types of visual depictions that have been illustrated in the said provision, to clearly indicate, that this subjective criterion applies to the entire provision i.e., to all types of visual depictions mentioned therein or in other words to ‘child pornography’.
