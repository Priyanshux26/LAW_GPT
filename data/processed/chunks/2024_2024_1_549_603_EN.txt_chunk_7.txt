It was by the same Amendment Act, that Section 17A was incorporated in the said statute. On this basis, it is urged, that any protective measure, which is conceived in the Amendment Act could not extend to offences committed when such protective measure for obtaining prior approval was not a part of the statutory scheme. The High Court primarily decided the case on the premise that the aforesaid provision cannot be given retrospective effect. 9. The other limb of argument of the State, which was also sustained by the High Court is that a regular inquiry was already ed on 05.06.2018 regarding the allegations of corruption against the officials of APSSDC. This was ed by the Director General of Anti-Corruption Bureau, Andhra Pradesh. A redacted version of this letter dated 05.06.2018 has been annexed in Volume V of the compilation of documents submitted by the State (at page 2 thereof). This compilation of documents (pages 2 to 7A of the said volume) suggests that Anti-Corruption Bureau had been asking for information in that regard. I quote below the redacted version of the said letter:- “ Office of the Director General Anti-Corruption Bureau, Andhra Pradesh, Vijayawada Rc No.10/RE-CIU/2018 Dated:5-6-2018 MEMORANDUM Sub:- Public Servants-Industries Department-Allegations of corruption against the officials of A.P.

The High Court has accepted the argument of the State that a regular enquiry was ed on 05.06.2018 regarding the allegations of corruption against the officials of APSSDC by the DG Anti-Corruption Bureau AP before Section 17A of the 1988 Act came into operation i.e. on 25.07.2018. As a corollary, the requirement of previous approval as contemplated in the aforesaid provision would not be applicable in the case of the appellant. 11. First, I shall examine the point as to whether enquiry had commenced by the letter of 05.06.2018. I have quoted the letter of 05.06.2018 in the preceding paragraph. This letter refers to an earlier letter dated 14.05.2018 addressed to the Andhra Pradesh Anti-Corruption Bureau by the Director General of GST Intelligence, Pune submitting information regarding corruption and siphoning of Government funds pertaining to APSSDC. The letter dated 05.06.2018 essentially carries a request for enquiry. There is no indication in the materials produced before us as to whether any step was taken in pursuance of such request till the year 2021. The first suggestion of any active enquiry can be seen in a letter of 22.02.2021 originating from the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti-Corruption Bureau of that State, which states that the bureau is investigating a regular enquiry pertaining to allegations of corruption, misappropriation of funds and procedural [2024] 1 S.C.R.
