Conclusion E 45. In the considered opinion of the Court, the High Court, without appreciating the testimonies of the witnesses mentioned above in their true import and meaning, and without having any discussion concerning the complicity of the accused, in a perfunctory manner held the prosecution to have established the case, which is entirely circumstantial in nature, against the present appellant. Significantly, the High Court F holds that the evidence reveals that “in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused”. Inter alia, it is this finding which we find to be erroneous, for the principle of determining the guilt of the accused in a case involving circumstantial evidence is not that of probability but certainty and that all the evidence present should G conclusively point towards only a singular hypothesis, which is the guilt of the accused, Pankaj Singh. 46. Given the above, the dated 14.1.2016 passed by the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur in Criminal Appeal No.468 of 2013 titled Maghavendra Pratap Singh @ Pankaj Singh v. State of H Chhattisgarh is set aside and the appeal is allowed. MAGHAVENDRA PRATAP SINGH @ PANKAJ SINGH v. 847 STATE OF CHHATTISGARH [SANJAY KAROL, J.] 47.
