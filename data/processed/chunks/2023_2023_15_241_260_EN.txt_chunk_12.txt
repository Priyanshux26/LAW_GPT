For illegal import, etc. - Whoever in contravention of this Act or of any rule or made under this Act: (a) imports, exports, [transports, transits or possesses] liquor or any intoxicating drug; or ×× ×× ×× (h) bottles any liquor for purposes of sale; or (i) Sells or stores for sales liquor] or any intoxicating drug.” 48. For the sake of brevity, we need not reiterate the evidence relating to the transport, bottling and sale of methyl alcohol. Alcohol as mentioned in Section 55, has been defi ned under Section 3(10) as any liquid consisting of or made of alcohol. Therefore, there can be no dispute that Section 55 applies to the transmission of methyl alcohol. It has been established that the methyl alcohol was fi rst purchased by A11, then shown to be sold to diff erent entities, however, it was provided to A1. These accused persons have been established to be in conspiracy for common objectives throughout. Therefore, the conviction of A10 and A11 has to be upheld under Section 55(a)(h) and (i) of the Abkari Act. 49. There can be no doubt left about the involvement of the accused persons before us, in the sale and mixing of methyl alcohol with spirit as part of the conspiracy, resulting in deaths and injuries to many innocent SAJEEV v. STATE OF KERALA 259 [SANJAY KAROL, J.] persons. The conviction of A10 and A11 under Sections 302, 307, 326 and 120B IPC and 57(A)(1)(ii) of the Abkari Act has to be upheld. 50. We therefore fi nd that the conclusion and conviction arrived concurrently by the High Court and Trial Court regarding the role played by these accused persons in this tragedy does not suff er from any infi rmity and does not warrant interference of this Court. 51. Independent of the above discussion, this Court has time and again reiterated that interference in concurrent convictions is only warranted when: i. The fi nding is perverse. ii. The fi nding is based or built on inadmissible evidence. iii. The Courts below have not considered or wrongly discarded vital pieces of evidence that would tilt the balance in favor of the accused. [Ref: Mekala Sivaiah v. State of A.P.14 (2-Judge Bench); Ravasaheb and Ors. v. State of Karnataka15 (3-Judge Bench)] On a perusal of the High Court and Trial Court s, it is our view that the present appellants have made out none of the above circumstances warranting interference of this Court. 52. We place on record with appreciation for the assistance rendered by the Learned Amicus Curiae. 53. In view of the above, the Appellants’ challenge to the impugned fails. 54. After the was dictated, we have been informed vide letter dated 31.10.2023, that one of the appellants, namely, Sajeev (A10 - Criminal Appeal No.1134 of 2011), has passed away on 24.09.2023. In that view of the matter, the appeal qua his conviction stands abated. 55. Criminal Appeal No.567/2015, preferred by A11 (Roy) is dismissed. The bail granted to A11 by this Court vide dated 30.06.2016 14 (2022) 8 SCC 253 15 (2023) 5 SCC 391 260 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R.
