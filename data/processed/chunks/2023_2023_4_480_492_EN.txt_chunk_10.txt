His incarceration for a sufficiently long period would not only ensure that he receives his D just deserts but also allow his daughter more time and maturity to settle down and move on with her life, even if her villainous father is set at liberty. We are, therefore, of the opinion that this is a fit and deserving case for exercise of the power vesting in this Court to impose a modified special category sentence of fixed-term life imprisonment. As pointed out by this Court in Madan Gopal Kakkad Vs. Naval Dubey and E another7, Judges who bear the sword of justice should not hesitate to use that sword with utmost severity to the full and to the end, if the gravity of the offence so demands. 17. The ends of justice would be sufficiently served if the life imprisonment of the appellant is for a minimum of 20 years of actual F incarceration before he can seek remissions under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, or any other enacted law. We, accordingly, direct so. Imposition of fines and imprisonment in default of payment thereof shall stand confirmed. The appeal is disposed of in terms of the above directions.
