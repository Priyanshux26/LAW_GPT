417.94 Crores in FY 2016- 2017; Rs. 500.03 Crores in FY 2017-2018; Rs. 679.23 Crores in FY 2018-2019 and Rs.860.59 Crores (estimated) for FY 2019-2020. The above growth is ample testimony of the credentials of the RA as a competent business leader and his H 902 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A capability to manage and turn around various diverse businesses.” 44.3.1. It is thus obvious that the appellant-resolution applicant admitted his status as founder and managing trustee of said Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth and then, boldly claimed that the entities under his leadership were growing rapidly while ensuring quality of service to nation and B public at large. In view of the claim made by the resolution applicant himself, coupled with the fact that in CIRP in question, two resolution plans were submitted by this appellant, one in individual capacity and another as managing director of the said trust, it is difficult to detach him from the said resolution applicant-Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth. Hence, it cannot be said that the Appellate Tribunal committed any error in observing that C the appellant was attempting to act as alter ego of the said ineligible applicant (the trust); and the benefit from his own (individual’s) resolution plan cannot escape the operation of Section 88 of the Trusts Act. Even if the appellant would assert that his financial capability was independent of trust money, the fact of the matter remains that he projected the D overall picture of his own profile while also relying on his status as Managing Trustee of the said trust, Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth. Thus, any pecuniary advantage gained by him under the resolution plan in question would be directly subsumed by operation of Section 88 of the Trusts Act. This would, in all practical purposes, bring about a position that what could not be done directly for the said trust was sought to be done E by the appellant by way of this indirect methodology. 44.4. Although, the aspects aforesaid did not form the part of consideration of CoC but, they cannot be ignored merely with reference to the status assigned to the commercial wisdom of CoC. The principles underlying the decisions of this Court respecting the commercial wisdom F of CoC cannot be over-expanded to brush aside a significant shortcoming in the decision making of CoC when it had not duly taken note of the operation of any provision of law for the time being in force. 44.5. In the given set of facts and circumstances of this case, in our view, the Appellate Tribunal has rightly held the resolution plan being G in contravention of the provisions of law for the time being in force. Observations and findings of the Appellate Tribunal in paragraphs 106 to 112 of the impugned dated 17.02.2022 (reproduced hereinabove in paragraph 19.4.2.) deserve to be and are approved. H M. K.
