Section 241(3) of the Act is required to be read along with Sections 243(1A) and 243(2). On a conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions, it is clear that the reference specifically in Section 241(3) of the Act to “any other office connected F with the conduct and management of any company” means those akin to manager, managing director or other director such as key managerial personnel and not an auditor. The words used in Section 241(3) of the Act are “conduct and management of the company”. As per the Scheme of the Act, 2013, more particularly Chapter X, the auditor acts as an G independent examiner of accounts and cannot be said to be holding an office in the conduct and management of the company. Therefore, the submission that what could be achieved under section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 can be achieved by Section 241(3) even after the auditor has resigned has no substance. H 1010 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 10. At this stage, it is required to be noted that in section 140(5), it is specifically mentioned that “without prejudice to any action under the provisions of this Act or any other law for the time being in force”. Therefore, the intention of the legislature while enacting section 140(5) is very clear and the powers conferred upon the Tribunal under section 140(5) shall be without prejudice to any action under the provisions of B the Companies Act, 2013 or any other law for the time being in force. Therefore, irrespective of any other provisions of the Act, 2013, the Tribunal is vested with the powers under Section 140(5) of the Act to pass a final against the auditor on the allegation that such an auditor of the company has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner. C 11. For the reasons stated above, the High Court has materially erred in holding that on resignation of auditors – BSR & Deloitte and on appoint of new auditors, application under section 140(5) shall not be maintainable. Consequently, the High Court has erred in setting aside the (s) passed by the NCLT/NCLAT by which the NCLT/NCLAT D held that despite the resignation of the auditors, enquiry/proceedings under Section 140(5) shall be maintainable and/or continued. As observed hereinabove, despite the subsequent resignation of the auditors and/or despite the resignation of an auditor even for the purpose of second proviso to section 140(5), the enquiry/proceedings/application under section 140(5) (first part) shall be maintainable and continued and on the E final being passed by the NCLT, as provided in section 140(5), consequence as provided under the second proviso to section 140(5) shall follow. As neither the NCLT nor the High Court have gone into the merits of the allegations against the respective auditors and the decision of the NCLT and the High Court is on the maintainability of the F proceedings under section 140(5) after resignation of the auditors, we refrain from considering anything on merits of the allegations against the auditors as the allegations of fraud etc.
