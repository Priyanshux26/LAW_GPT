Saxena, Advs. for the Respondent. 648 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports / of the Supreme Court Sudhanshu Dhulia, J. 1. The appellants (the defendants in the suit), are here in challenge to the judgement dated 08.12.2022 whereby their Appeal was dismissed by the Division Bench of Calcutta High Court, upholding the of the learned Single Judge (which was a on admission), dated 29.06.2022. While decreeing the suit, the Court had directed the appellants (tenant) to vacate the suit property and handover the vacant possession to the respondent-plaintiff, within sixty days! 2. This is a landlord-tenant matter arising out of an eviction suit filed by the respondent before the Calcutta High Court, inter alia, praying for eviction of appellants from Room No.208, 2nd Floor, 25-A Park Street, Kolkata (hereafter referred as the “premises”). Even before the appellants could file a Written Statement, the plaintiff, without loosing any time, filed an application under XII Rule 61 Code of Civil Procedure (“CPC”) seeking a ‘ on admission’ by relying on the deposition of defendant no.1 in another case where the defendant had admitted that the tenancy was in his mother’s name. According to the plaintiff/respondent, since the mother of the defendants/appellants had admittedly died way back in the year 2009, they are not entitled to stay in the premises beyond the year 2014 in terms of section 2(g) of the 1997 Act, which protects the rights of the children and dependents of a tenant only for a limited period of five years.
