In this respect, reliance can be placed upon the responses given by the Government to the queries raised by the Parliamentary Committee. The Union of India has filed Action Taken Reports with respect to the recommendations made by the Standing Committee. Conditional approval by Government of India for Environmental Release of DMH-11: 14. We shall now proceed to the actual controversy. According to Union of India, the conditional approval for environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 and parental lines bn 3.6 and modbs 2.99 containing barnase, barstar and bar genes has been made after following the detailed procedure in law and after considering the biosafety data accumulated over several years. Also, the conditional approval has been made in accordance with the guidelines and framework which enable a consistent and rigorous risk-analysis approach to evaluating applications for the environmental release of GE plants is the contention of the Union of India. 14.1 That in the instant case, after recommendation of RCGM, GEAC had considered the recommendations of RCGM in the following meetings in regard to confined field trials: 2002 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
