1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned and passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in Writ Petition F (C) No. 2916 of 2015 by which the High Court has allowed the said writ petition and has declared that the acquisition with respect to the land in question is deemed to have lapsed by virtue of Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to G as “Act, 2013”), the Land Acquisition Collector and Anr. have preferred the present appeal. 2. From the impugned and passed by the High Court, it appears that the award under Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1894”) with respect to the H land in question was made as far as back on 19.06.1992. According to LAND ACQUISITION COLLECTOR AND ANR. 231 v. B. S. DHILLION [M. R. SHAH, J.] the appellants and so stated in the counter before the High Court, it was A the specific case on behalf of the appellants that the possession of the land in question was taken on 21.04.2006 and was handed over to the DDA on the spot by preparing the possession proceedings. However, despite the above and relying upon the earlier decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. Vs. Harakchand B Misirimal Solanki and Ors., (2014) 3 SCC 183, the High Court has allowed the writ petition and has declared that the acquisition with respect to the land in question is deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013. 2.1 The decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal C Corporation and Anr. (supra), which has been heavily relied upon by the High Court while passing the impugned and has been subsequently overruled by this Court in the Constitution Bench decision in the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and Ors. (2020) 8 SCC 129. In paragraphs 365 and 366, the Constitution Bench of this Court has observed and held as under:- D “365. Resultantly, the decision rendered in Pune Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183] is hereby overruled and all other decisions in which Pune Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183] has been E followed, are also overruled. The decision in Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. [Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. v. State of T.N., (2015) 3 SCC 353] cannot be said to be laying down good law, is overruled and other decisions following the same are also overruled. In Indore Development Authority v. Shailendra F [(2018) 3 SCC 412], the aspect with respect to the proviso to Section 24(2) and whether “or” has to be read as “nor” or as “and” was not placed for consideration. Therefore, that decision too cannot prevail, in the light of the discussion in the present . G 366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under: 366.1.
