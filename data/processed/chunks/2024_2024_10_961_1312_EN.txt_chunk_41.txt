Digital Supreme Court Reports 22. Apart from these general norms, the Constitution also prescribed citizenship norms for immigrants to and from Pakistan. For this, Article 6 provided citizenship to people who migrated from Pakistan if: (i) such person/either of their parents/ grand-parents were born in undivided India; (ii) if such person was an ordinary resident since the date of their migration; and (iii) such person was registered as a citizen of India if such migration was after 19.07.1948. As a corollary, Article 7 prohibited citizenship to people who migrated from India to Pakistan after 01.03.1947 and then sought citizenship after re-migrating to India, unless they came back under a permit for resettlement or permanent return. Similar to these provisions is Section 6A, which provides a framework addressing the conferment of citizenship to migrants entering the State of Assam based on their date of entry.28 23. Section 6A, which is presently under challenge, was inserted into the Citizenship Act, via Act 65 of 1985 and came into force with effect from 07.12.1985. This provision created special conditions for the citizenship of migrants who entered into Assam in accordance with certain cut-off dates. As per the provision, first, those who entered Assam from Bangladesh prior to 01.01.1966 were deemed to be Indian citizens, and second, those who entered into Assam between the period of 01.01.1966 and 25.03.1971 were conferred citizenship based on the fulfilment of specific procedures and conditions. Those who entered Assam after 25.03.1971 have been denied citizenship by implication. 24. To analyze this provision comprehensively, it is imperative to go through Section 6A and the language it employs.
