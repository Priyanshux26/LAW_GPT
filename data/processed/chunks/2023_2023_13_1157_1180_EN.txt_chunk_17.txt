31. The High Court was persuaded by the homicidal death of the deceased while ignoring multiple fi ndings rendered by the trial court including the fact that the house of the deceased was surrounded by numerous other houses. Thus, on the basis of the discussion made, we are constrained to come to the conclusion that the appellant is entitled to the benefi t of doubt as the prosecution has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The impugned passed by the High Court is set aside and resultantly, the of acquittal passed by the trial court stands restored. The appeals are allowed. The appellant is directed to be released forthwith, if not required in any other case. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals allowed. Nidhi Jain
