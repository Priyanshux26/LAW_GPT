The High Court’s dated B 20.06.2000 in Writ Petition No. 19555 of 1999 clearly shows that absorption has been given effect to vide dated 26.09.1996. The said writ petition was dismissed to the extent of entitlement of back dated appointment and arrears. However, the Respondents never paid any heed to such and inordinately delayed the Appellant’s appointment, while simultaneously absorbing other casual employees. C Even the Appellant’s service book records that Respondent No. 3- Municipality has absorbed the Appellant in view of the High Court’s dated 20.06.2000 in Writ Petition No. 19555 (W) of 1999. 23. The Respondent has relied on Umadevi (supra) to contend that there is no fundamental right in those who have been D employed on daily wages or temporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in service. The relevant portion of the factual position in Umadevi (supra) is being reproduced as hereunder: “8. ….the respondents therein who were temporarily engaged on daily wages in the Commercial Taxes Department in some E of the districts of the State of Karnataka claim that they worked in the Department based on such engagement for more than 10 years and hence they are entitled to be made permanent employees of the Department, entitled to all the benefits of regular employees. They were engaged for the first time in F the years 1985-86 and in the teeth of s not to make such appointments issued on 3-7-1984. Though the Director of Commercial Taxes recommended that they be absorbed, the Government did not accede to that recommendation. These respondents thereupon approached the Administrative Tribunal in the year 1997 with their claim. The Administrative G Tribunal rejected their claim finding that they had not made out a right either to get wages equal to that of others regularly employed or for regularisation. Thus, the applications filed were dismissed. The respondents approached the High Court of Karnataka challenging the decision of the Administrative H 436 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A Tribunal. It is seen that the High Court without really coming to grips with the question falling for decision in the light of the findings of the Administrative Tribunal and the decisions of this Court, proceeded to that they are entitled to wages equal to the salary and allowances that are being paid to the regular employees of their cadre in government service with B effect from the dates from which they were respectively appointed. It may be noted that this gave retrospective effect to the of the High Court by more than 12 years. The High Court also issued a command to the State to consider their cases for regularisation within a period of four months C from the date of receipt of that . The High Court seems to have proceeded on the basis that, whether they were appointed before 1-7-1984, a situation covered by the decision of this Court in Dharwad District PWD Literate Daily Wage Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR D 544] and the scheme framed pursuant to the direction thereunder, or subsequently, since they have worked for a period of 10 years, they were entitled to equal pay for equal work from the very inception of their engagement on daily wages and were also entitled to be considered for E regularisation in their posts.” 24.
