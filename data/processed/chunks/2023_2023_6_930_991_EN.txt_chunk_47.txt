We bear in mind that no doubt it would have mattered little to the applicability of Article 96 that the transferor purported to transfer waqf property professing it to be his property having E regard to what this Court has laid down in Srinivasa (supra). But this is a case where the voidness arises on account of the fact that what is found to be waqf property has been purported to be alienated contrary to the peremptory statutory mandate. We have also noticed Section 69 of the 1960 Act and its impact. 69. The argument that Section 107 of the Act will assist the F appellant in tiding over the bar of limitation does not appeal to us. Section 107 of the Act, no doubt, proclaims that nothing in the Limitation Act,1963 shall apply to any suit for possession of the immovable property comprised in any waqf or for possession of any interest in such property. 70. The Act came into force on 01.01.1996. The first sale was G effected on 14.10.1960. The second sale was effected on 26.09.1974. As far as the first sale is concerned, we have already found that Article 96 cannot be pressed into service as the transfer was not purported to be made by the Mutawalli. The doors stood open for the application of Article 65. As far as the second sale is concerned which was effected H 990 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A in the year 1974 in view of our finding that Article 96 was not applicable, the only other competing Article vying for acceptance, appears to be Article 65. Applying Article 65 and as the adverse possession would kick in from the date of the transfer, on the expiry of twelve years, i.e., in 1986 applying Section 27 of the Limitation Act whatever title remained within the meaning of Section 65 would stand extinguished. The Act B was brought into force only with effect from 01.01.1996. We cannot understand the purport of Section 107 to be that it would revive an extinguished title as nothing stood in the way of running of time from the date of the second sale under the law as it stood. 71. No doubt, the law of limitation is what prevails as on the date C of the suit (see C. Beepathumma and others v. Velasari Shankaranarayana Kadambolithaya and others26). Taking 1997 as the date, on which a suit is filed, and applying the Act, which enables the plaintiff to disregard the bar of law of limitation, it cannot mean that what stood extinguished under the earlier law would revive. In this regard, D we notice the of this Court in T. Kaliamurthi (supra): “40. In this background, let us now see whether this section has any retrospective effect. It is well settled that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective operation until its language is such that would require such conclusion. The exception to this E rule is enactments dealing with procedure.
