The writ petition was filed more than 18 years after the impugned was passed. The grievance raised was that the objections filed by the writ petitioners during the course of settlement were not considered by the authority concerned and the land was recorded in the name of General D Administration Department (GAD). Liberty was granted to the writ petitioners to file representation to the GAD. The grievance was that the representation was filed, however, the same has not been decided. The stand of the learned counsel for the State was also recorded that when final record of rights was published, it was open to the writ E petitioners to file appropriate revision application under Section 15(b) of the Orissa Survey & Settlement Act, 1958 (for short, ‘the 1958 Act’). The same was not filed. There is no scope for interference in the writ jurisdiction. It was further submitted that the observation was made by the authority in the referred to in the writ petition that the petitioners can make representation to the GAD against the final record of rights, if F so advised. The writ petition was dismissed. Being aggrieved by the same, intra court appeal was filed by the respondents. The matter was taken in a different direction altogether. In fact, with the observations made by the Division Bench the record of right, which was prepared way back in the year 1962, was set aside. The direction was given for G consideration of the representation of the appellants before the High Court and allot them a suitable plot in exchange of their stitiban/sthitiban land.1 It is the aforesaid which has been impugned by the State. 1 The expression ‘Stitiban/Sthitiban’ signifies the status of a settled raiyat or homestead of a raiyat (i.e., an agriculturist).
