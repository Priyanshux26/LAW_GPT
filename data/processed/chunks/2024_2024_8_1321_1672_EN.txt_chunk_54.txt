The use of the phrase “deemed to be” is not conclusive of a legal fiction.154 The word deemed is used for many purposes, such as for the artificial construction of a word and to clarify uncertain constructions, or plainly just to mean “regarded as being”.155 A legal fiction is essentially a presumption that certain facts which do not exist in fact, will be treated as real and existing for the purpose of law. Courts have evolved two principles on the operation of legal fictions. The first principle is that a legal fiction must be confined to its ‘legitimate field’, for the specific purpose for which it was created.156 In Bengal Immunity Company Ltd v. State of Bihar,157 a seven-Judge Bench of this Court held that legal fictions are created only for a certain purpose and they must be confined only to that “legitimate field”. In its decision in that case, this Court held that the deeming fiction in the Explanation to Article 286(1)(a), before the Constitution (Sixth Amendment) Act 1956, (by which a sale was deemed to have taken place in the State where the goods were delivered because of the direct sale) only applied to Article 286(1)(a) and not to Article 286(2). This Court held that the scope of Article 286(1)(a) which barred a State from imposing tax on sales outside the State, was different from the scope of Article 286 (2) which stated that unless otherwise provided by law, State laws could not tax a sale or purchase which took place in the course of inter-state trade or commerce.158 154 See Consolidated Coffee Ltd v. Coffee Board, Bangalore (1980) 3 SCC 358 [11,12]; Bhuwalka Steel Industries Limited v. Union of India (2017) 5 SCC 598 [36,37,43,44] 155 St. Aubyn v. Attorney General, 1952 AC 15, 53 [Lord Radcliffe] 156 Industrial Supplies Private Limited v. Union of India (1980) 4 SCC 341 [25]; K. Prabhakaran v. P. Jayarajan (2005) 1 SCC 754 [39]; See Bengal Immunity Company Ltd v. State of Bihar (1955) SCC OnLine SC 2 157 Bengal Immunity Company Ltd v. State of Bihar (1955) SCC OnLine SC 2 [Justice Das, 32] 158 52. A legal fiction pre-supposes the correctness of the state of facts on which it is based and all the consequences which flow from that state of facts have got to be worked out to their logical extent. But due regard must be had in this behalf to the purpose for which the legal fiction has been created. If the purpose of this legal fiction contained in the Explanation to Article 286(1)(a) is solely for the purpose of sub-clause (a) as expressly stated it would not be legitimate to travel beyond the scope of that purpose and read into the provision any other purpose howsoever attractive it may be. The legal fiction which [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1395 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. 108. The second principle is that the scope of the legal fiction must be extended to the consequences which “logically” flow from its creation.
