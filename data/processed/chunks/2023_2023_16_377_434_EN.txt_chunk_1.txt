Held: On a plain reading of sub-section (9) of Section 10 of the Act 1996, it appears that the person sought to be appointed as a Vice-Chancellor must not be more than sixty-years of age at the time of appointment i.e., it provides the outer age limit for appointment – While sub-section (10) of Section 10 of the Act 1996 provides that upon appointment, the term of the Vice-Chancellor would be for four years and that he shall be eligible for reappointment – The proviso attached to sub-section (10) stipulates that no person shall be appointed as Vice- Chancellor for more than two terms – Sub-section (9) of Section 10 of the Act 1996 will apply only at the stage of appointment of Vice- Chancellor and would have no application whatsoever when it comes to reappointment of Vice-Chancellor under sub-section (10) – This is reinforced from the words “shall be eligible for reappointment” occurring in sub-section (10) which connotes that the same is an enabling provision whereby the Vice-Chancellor by virtue of holding his offi ce is deemed eligible for reappointment irrespective of the other provisions – If the outer age limit provided in sub-section (9) would apply even to reappointment, then the same would eff ectively mean that only those persons who are appointed as Vice-Chancellor at the age of fi fty-fi ve or below could be considered for reappointment – Such an interpretation would result in conditions being read into sub-section (10) which have DR. PREMACHANDRAN KEEZHOTH & ANR. v. THE 379 CHANCELLOR KANNUR UNIVERSITY not been prescribed by the legislature – Had the intent of legislature been otherwise, sub-section (10) or the words “shall be eligible for re-appointment” would have been specifi cally qualifi ed by or made subject to the words “sub-section (9)” or “provisions of this section” – If sub-section (9) is interpreted so as to be made applicable even to reappointment as provided in sub-section (10), then the result would be that any person who is appointed as Vice-Chancellor at the age of fi fty- six or more would not be eligible for reappointment, thereby rendering sub-section (10) and its proviso completely otiose and meaningless in such cases – A purposive construction may be taken recourse to for the purpose of giving full eff ect to the statutory provisions – Thus, the outer age limit of sixty years provided in sub-section (9) of Section 10 of the Act 1996 will not apply, when it comes to reappointment under sub- section (10) of Section 10 of the Act 1996. [Paras 48, 50, 52, 53, 56, 57] Kannur University Act, 1996 – s. 10(9) and s.10(10) – Whether the reappointment of the Vice-Chancellor has to follow the same process as a fresh appointment by setting up a selection committee under Section 10(1) of the Act 1996. Held: Reappointment of Vice-Chancellor has been provided under sub- section (10) of Section 10 of the Act 1996 – The proviso to sub-section (10) of the Act 1996 further makes the intention of the legislature to provide for reappointment more clear – The legislature has not thought fi t to prescribe any particular procedure or any particular mode or manner of reappointment – The UGC Regulations are also silent as regards the reappointment of Vice-Chancellor – In the case at hand, sub-section (10) of Section 10 of the Act, 1996, provides for reappointment and does not even contain the words “subject to provisions of this section” – This is as good as to refl ect the legislature’s intention of permitting reappointment without following the ordinary process of appointment of Vice-Chancellor – Thus, it is not necessary to follow the procedure of appointment as laid down in Section 10 of the Act 1996 for the purpose of reappointment.
