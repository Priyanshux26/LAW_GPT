1 to cancel the Tender and float a fresh tender; (d) During the pendency of the Petition, restrain Respondent No. 1 from taking any steps towards award of contract under the Tender; D (e) ad-interim reliefs in terms of prayers in clause (d) above; (f) Cost of the present Petition; and (g) such further and other reliefs as the nature and the circumstances of the case may require be granted to the Petitioner.” E 20. During the pendency of the aforesaid writ petition BEST awarded the Tender in favour of EVEY with the Letter of Acceptance dated 20.05.2022. EVEY accordingly submitted the required Performance Bank Guarantee on 23.05.2022. An agreement for operation of Stage Carriage Services for public transport of Single Decker AC F Electric Buses with Driver in the city of Mumbai and its extended suburbs on Gross Contract Cost (GCC) model for 12 years was entered into between the EVEY and BEST on 26.05.2022. 21. A subsidy bank guarantee dated 02.06.2022 was submitted by EVEY and BEST released the requisite amount to the EVEY’s account G towards subsidy on 10.06.2022. The EVEY even provided the BEST with 8 buses between 04.07.2022 and 05.07.2022. 22. The High Court vide its impugned and dated 05.07.2022, took the view that the requirement for the operating range to be more than 200 Kms in a single charge in “actual conditions” was H unambiguous. Accordingly, the High Court upheld the disqualification of TATA MOTORS LTD. v. THE BRIHAN MUMBAI ELECTRIC SUPPLY 703 & TRANSPORT UNDERTAKING (BEST) [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] TATA Motors and rejected their claim from being considered as an eligible A bidder as they failed to comply with the technical requirements of the Tender. The High Court in paragraphs 9 and 13 respectively of the impugned observed thus: “9. Reading the aforesaid, it is unambiguous that operating range provided in the tender document is that the electric B vehicles manufacturers have to provide the vehicles which can run 200 kms in single charge for SD air conditioning buses in actual conditions for relevant GVW air conditioning. The prima donna requirement of the tender document it appears is that the electric vehicle offered should run 200 C Kms in a single charge for Single Decker air conditioning bus in actual conditions with 80% SoC without any interruption. Xxx xxx xxx 13. Petitioner No.1 did not submit its bid for 200 Kms@ 80% D SoC in single charge on actual condition but at standard test conditions as per AIS 040. As per the tender condition if a person to whom the contract is awarded i.e. lessee does not comply with the condition of achieving range of 200 Kms at 80% SoC in single charge then he is penalized for the same. E Meaning thereby, Respondent No.1 was conscious that the standard test conditions as per AIS 040 is different than the actual condition. The tender of the Petitioner certainly was not compliant with the said clause. The Petitioner has deviated from the material and the substantial term of the tender.
