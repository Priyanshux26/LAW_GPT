10. Now, so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of Sridevi Datla vs. Union of India reported in (2021) 5 SCC 321 relied upon on behalf of the appellant is concerned, D at the outset it is required to be noted that in the said decision, this Court has not noticed the decision in the case of Assam Urban (Supra) and there is no discussion on distinction between “prescribed period” and the “discretionary condonable period”. On the other hand, the binding decision of this Court in the case of Assam Urban (Supra) is directly E on point. 11. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, applying the law laid down by this Court in the case of Assam Urban (Supra), it cannot be said that the High Court and the learned III Additional District & Sessions Judge, Vijaypur have committed any error in refusing to F condone the delay caused in preferring application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which was beyond the period prescribed under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Under the circumstances, the present Appeal deserves to be dismissed and is, accordingly, dismissed. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no as to costs.
