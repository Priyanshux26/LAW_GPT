9. In the meanwhile, the appellants approached the respondent authorities seeking pension in the corresponding scale of Rs.37400- 67000 + AGP Rs.9000/- with effect from 01.01.2006 on par with the employees/teachers of the Government Colleges in Haryana, which was rejected on the ground that such benefit was granted only to the teachers working in the Government colleges and not for the teachers working in Government Aided Colleges. Challenging the said rejection, CWP.No.8988 of 2015 etc. cases were filed. During the pendency of the same, the State accepted the claim of the appellants and hence, the writ petitions came to be dismissed as withdrawn on 30.11.2016. Seeking to review the in respect of grant of interest on delayed payment of pension, the State preferred the Review application, which was dismissed. However, the Letter Patent Appeals7 filed by the State were allowed by the High Court, by observing that the appellants were fence-sitters and were seeking 6 LPA No.1955 of 2012 was dismissed on 14.01.2013 and SLP (C) No.26907 of 2013 was dismissed on 10.07.2014 7 LPA Nos.2396 of 2017 etc. cases against the dated 30.11.2016 in CWP No.8988 of 2015 and connected cases [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1743 K.C. Kaushik and Others v. State of Haryana and Others the benefits on the strength of the original litigation, which others had successfully contested upto Apex Court and therefore, they cannot be placed at a better footing than the original litigants, who never got interest. The said of the High Court is questioned in these appeals by special leave. 10. The common submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants in all the appeals is that by the impugned herein, the appellants have been illegally and arbitrarily denied interest on the belated payment of revised pension w.e.f 01.01.2006, by observing that they were fence-sitters and hence cannot be placed at a better pedestal than the original litigants, who had successfully contested and won the case and were not granted interest. According to the learned counsel, the said observation of the High Court is in complete disregard to the fact that the original litigants referred to in the impugned herein, were Lecturers/ Librarians in the Government Colleges, who had started getting the revised pension w.e.f. 01.01.2006 and from whom recovery was initiated by the respondent authorities on the premise that they were made excess payment and therefore, the issue of interest on delayed payment of pension did not arise therein. It is further elaborated that the appellants who had retired from Government Aided Private Colleges prior to 01.01.2006 were claiming parity with the pension allowed and paid to the Lecturers of Government Colleges and hence, by no stretch of imagination they could be termed as fence sitters; and by payment of interest on the delayed payment of pension, it cannot be said that they will be placed at a better footing than the original litigants, since the original litigants continued to get the revised pension, whereas in the case of the appellants, even the revised pension was not paid to them until the year 2017-2018, despite the passing of the s dated 30.11.2016 by the learned Single Judge.
