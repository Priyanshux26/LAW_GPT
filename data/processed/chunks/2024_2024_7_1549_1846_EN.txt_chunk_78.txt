120. In Quarry Owners Association v. State of Bihar, this Court held that royalty “does not constitute usual tax as commonly understood” but includes return for the consideration for parting with the property.174 In Kesoram (supra), a Constitution Bench had to decide on the validity of a cess levied by the State on coal-bearing land. The measure of the cess was relatable to the quantity of minerals produced from land. Whether royalty is a tax was not directly in issue. In fact, Justice Lahoti, speaking for the majority, held that India Cement (supra) was distinguishable because in that case cess was levied on royalty and not on mineral rights or lands. However, the learned Judge felt “constrained” and “duty-bound” to point out a typographical error in the majority opinion in India Cement (supra) to prevent any “adverse impact on subsequent judicial pronouncements”. Paragraph 34 of India Cement (supra) was held to contain a typographical error, which Justice Lahoti explained thus: 170 [1989] Supp. 2 SCR 406 : (1989) Supp. 2 SCC 744 171 [1991] 2 SCR 105 : (1991) Supp. 1 SCC 430 [36] 172 [2000] Supp. 4 SCR 44 : (2001) 1 SCC 91 173 [1995] 1 SCR 756 : (1995) Supp. 1 SCC 642 [12] 174 Quarry Owners Association v. State of Bihar (2000) 8 SCC 655 [34] 1650 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “57. In the first sentence the word “royalty” occurring in the expression “royalty is a tax”, is clearly an error. What the majority wished to say, and has in fact said, is “cess on royalty is a tax”. The correct words to be printed in the should have been “cess on royalty” in place of “royalty” only. The words “cess on” appear to have been inadvertently or erroneously omitted while typing the text of the . This is clear from reading the in its entirety. Vide paras 22 and 31, which precede para 34 abovesaid, Their Lordships have held that “royalty” is not a tax. Even the last line of para 34 records “royalty on mineral rights is not a tax on land but a payment for the user of land”. The very first sentence of the para records in quick succession “… as such a cess on royalty being a tax on royalty, is beyond the competence of the State Legislature….” What Their Lordships have intended to record is “… that cess on royalty is a tax, and as such a cess on royalty being a tax on royalty, is beyond the competence of the State Legislature …”. That makes correct and sensible reading. A doubtful expression occurring in a , apparently by mistake or inadvertence, ought to be read by assuming that the Court had intended to say only that which is correct according to the settled position of law, and the apparent error should be ignored, far from making any capital out of it, giving way to the correct expression which ought to be implied or necessarily read in the context, also having regard to what has been said a little before and a little after.
