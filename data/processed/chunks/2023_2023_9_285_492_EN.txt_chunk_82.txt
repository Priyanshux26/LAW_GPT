18. Taking assistance thereof, Mr. Banerjee submits thatSections 33 or 35 are not concerned with any copy of the instrument and there is no scope for the inclusion of the copy of the document for the purpose G of the Act, 1899. The copy of the instrument within the meaning of Section 2(14) of the Act, 1899 cannot be validated by impounding and it cannot be admitted as secondary evidence under the Act, 1899. 6 (1971) 1 SCC 545 7 (2007) 8 SCC 514 H 394 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A 19. Mr. Banerjee further submits that the very question raised for consideration of this Court as to whether the arbitral agreement is valid or isin existence in law, is not open to be examined at the pre-referral stage for the reason that original instrument is not on record (arbitral agreement) and a conjoint reading of Sections 33 and 35 is not concerned with any copy of the instrument and the party can only be allowed to B rely on the document in evidence which is an instrument withing the meaning of Section 2(14) and the validity of the document is always open to be examined at the post-referral stage by the Arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal in its jurisdiction vested in Section 16 of the Act, 1996. 20. Mr. Gagan Sanghi, learned counsel for the appellant, submits C that Section 35 of the Act, 1899 bars admission of unduly stamped “instrument” in evidence “for any purpose” and also “acting upon it” and it was held by this Court in Government of Andhra Pradesh and Others v P. Laxmi Devi(Smt. )8 that “shall” in Section 33 of the Act, 1899 is mandatory and unstamped document must be impounded.Even D assuming that stamp duty is not payable on an arbitration agreement under the Act, 1899, when arbitration agreement is contained as a clause in an instrument on which stamp duty is payable, such arbitration agreement as an instrument, attracts the bar of Section 35 of the Act, 1899. E 21. Mr. Sanghi further submits that separation of agreement from the substantive contract is nothing but a legal fiction created by Section 16 of the Act, 1996 and it cannot be an exception to Section 35 of the Act, 1899. 22. Mr. Sanghi further submits that the Doctrine of Separability and Kompetenz-Kompetenz has no bearing on the issue of enforceability F of an arbitration agreement when proper stamp duty is not paid on the instrument containing the arbitration agreement and relied upon the of the UK Supreme Court in Enka Insaat Ve Sanayi AS v OOO Insurance Company Chubb9 where it was held that an “arbitration clause is nonetheless part of bundle of rights and obligations recorded in G the contractual document” and according to him, the issue of stamping is to be looked into at the very threshold, even if it is in exercise of Section 11 (6A), i.e. at the time of pre-arbitral stage with respect to 8 (2008) 4 SCC 720 H 9 (2020) UKSC 38 M/s N.
