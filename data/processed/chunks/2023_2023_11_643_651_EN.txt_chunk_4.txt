14. Further, we notice the directions of the High Court not to be in the light of settled principles of law, for the does not qualify the tests laid down by this Court in State of UP v. Mohammad Naim2 (four-Judge Bench), in regards to passing remarks against a person, whose conduct is being scrutinised before them i.e., “whether the party whose conduct is in question is before the Court or has an opportunity of explaining or defending himself; whether there is evidence on record bearing on that conduct, justifying the remarks; whether it is necessary for the decision of the case, as an integral part thereof, to animadvert on that conduct.” 15. These principles stand reiterated and followed in various s such as R. K. Lakshmanan v. A.K. Srinivasan3 (three-Judge Bench); S.K. Viswambaran v. E. Koyakunju4 (two-Judge Bench); Samya Seet v. Shambhu Sarkar5 (three-Judge Bench); State of Madhya Pradesh v. Narmada Bachao Andolan6 (three-Judge Bench) and K. G. Shanti v. United Indian Insurance Co. Ltd and Ors7 (two-Judge Bench). 16. It is apparent from record that, neither was the offi cer made party to the dispute, nor was he given an opportunity to show cause, and further, nothing on record refl ected the offi cer holding an animus against the respondent, before such adverse directions were passed against him. 17. By way of this appeal, we have been asked to exercise powers, inherent in this Court, to expunge remarks reproduced supra against the said offi cer, from record. It would be appropriate to consider the various principles in respect of passing adverse remarks against an offi cer- be it judicial, civil (as in the present case) or police or army personnel, and expunction thereof. 18. The three principles laid down in Naim (supra) deal with what is required of the court, prior to, fi nding it fi t to pass adverse remarks. 18.1 It has been reasserted time and again that remarks adverse in nature, should not be passed in ordinary circumstances, or unless absolutely 2 AIR 1964 SC 703 3 (1975) 2 SCC 466 4 (1987) 2 SCC 109 5 (2005) 6 SCC 767 6 (2011) 12 SCC 689 7 (2021) 5 SCC 511 650 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. necessary which is further qualified by, being necessary for proper adjudication of the case at hand8. 18.2 Remarks by a court should at all times be governed by the principles of justice, fair play and restraint9. Words employed should refl ect sobriety, moderation and reserve.10 18.3 It should not be lost sight of and per contra, always be remembered that such remarks, “due to the great power vested in our robes, have the ability to jeopardize and compromise independence of judges”; and may “deter offi cers and various personnel in carrying out their duty”. It further fl ows therefrom that “adverse remarks, of serious nature, upon the character and/ or professional competence of a person should not be passed lightly”.11 19. Keeping the above principles in mind, the power to expunge remarks may be exercised by the High Court and this Court: – 19.1 With great caution and circumspection, since it is an undefi ned power12; 19.2 Only to remedy a fl agrant abuse of power which has been made by passing comments that are likely to cause harm or prejudice13; 19.3 In respect of High Courts exercising such power, it has been observed: 19.3.1 The High Court, as the Supreme Court of revision, must be deemed to have power to see that courts below do not unjustly and without any lawful excuse take away the character of a party or of a witness or of a counsel before it.14 8 Niranjan Patnaik v.
