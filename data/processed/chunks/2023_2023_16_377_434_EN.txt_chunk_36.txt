(Vide Purtabpore Co. Ltd. v. Cane Commr. of Bihar [(1969) 1 SCC 308 : AIR 1970 SC 1896], Chandrika Jha v. State of Bihar [(1984)2 SCC 41 : AIR 1984 SC 322], Tarlochan Dev Sharma v. State of Punjab [(2001) 6 SCC 260 : AIR 2001 SC 2524] and Manohar Lal v. Ugrasen [(2010) 11SCC 557 : (2010) 4 SCC (Civ)524 : AIR 2010 SC 2210]. 27. Similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Commr. of Police v. Gordhandas Bhanji (AIR 1952 SC 16), Bahadursinh Lakhubhai Gohil v. Jagdishbhai M. Kamalia [(2004) 2 SCC 65 : AIR 2004 SC 1159] and Pancham Chand v. State of H.P. [(2008) 7 SCC 117 : AIR 2008 SC 1888] observing that an authority vested with the power to act under the statute alone should exercise its discretion following the procedure prescribed therein and interference on the part of any authority upon whom the statute does not confer any jurisdiction, is wholly unwarranted in law. It violates the constitutional scheme. 28. In view of the above, the legal position emerges that the authority who has been vested with the power to exercise its discretion alone can pass the . Even a senior offi cial cannot provide for any 430 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. guideline or direction to the authority under the statute to act in a particular manner.” (Emphasis supplied) 75. In Hardwari Lal, Rohtak v. G.D. Tapase, Chandigarh and others reported in AIR 1982 Punjab and Haryana 439 (Full Bench) the powers of the Governor with respect to the appointment/removal of the Vice-Chancellor of Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak under the Maharshi Dayanand University (Amendment) Act, 1980 were considered wherein a direction was sought with regard to the renewal of the term of the Vice-Chancellor of the said University. Certain promises had been made in connection with the same while making such appointment. The Court held that as the Governor was the ex offi cio Chancellor of the University, therefore, by virtue of his offi ce, he was not bound to act under the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. Under Article 154 of the Constitution, the executive powers of the State are vested in the Governor which may be exercised by him either directly, or through offi cers subordinate to him, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Article 161 confers upon the Governor, a large number of powers including the grant of pardon, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment, etc. Such executive power can be exercised by him only in accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. Article 162 states that the executive power of the State shall extend to all such matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has the power to make laws. Therefore, the said provision widens the powers of the Governor. Article 166(3) of the Constitution further bestows upon the Governor the power to make rules for more convenient transactions of business of the Government of the State and also for the purpose of allocating among the Ministers of State such business.
