On 11 May 2022, the Central Board of Direct Taxes issued an Instruction30 for the implementation of the decision Ashish Agarwal (supra). The Instruction “clarified” that Ashish Agarwal (supra) will apply “to all cases where extended reassessment notices have been issued […] irrespective of the fact whether such notices have been challenged or not.” Paragraph 6.1 of the Instruction stated that the reassessment notices will “travel back in time to their original date when such notices were to be issued and then new section 149 of the Act is to be applied at that point.” Thus, the Instruction is based on the presumption that the notices issued under Section 148 of the new regime will travel back in time to their original dates, that is, the date when the Section 148 notice under the old regime was issued. 15. Paragraph 6.2 of the Instruction elaborated on the mechanism for issuing notices under Section 148 of the new regime: “6.2 Based on the above, the extended assessment notices are to be dealt with as under: AY 2013-14, AY 2014-15 and AY 2015-16: Fresh notice under section 148 of the Act can be issued in these cases, with the approval of the specified authority, only if the case falls under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 149 as amended by the Finance Act, 2021 and reproduced in paragraph 6.1 above. Specified authority under section 151 of the new law in this case shall be the authority prescribed under clause (ii) of that section. AY 16-17, AY 17-18: Fresh notice under Section 148 can be issued in these cases, with the approval of the specified authority, under clause (a) of sub-section (1) of new section 149 of the Act, since they are within the period of three years from the end of the relevant assessment year. Specified authority under section 151 of the new law in this case shall be the authority prescribed under clause (i) of that section.” 30 Instruction No. 01/2022 dt. 11 May 2022 1660 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
