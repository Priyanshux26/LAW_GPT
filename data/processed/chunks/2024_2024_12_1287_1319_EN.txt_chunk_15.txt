The direction so issued by this Court on 19.03.2024 reads: “2. After some hearing, it is clear that the State shall issue necessary TDR as directed by this Court on 21.11.2014 and on 17.05.2022. Taking note of the submissions of the learned Advocate General, we direct compliance within a period of eight weeks from today.” “3. dated 2 1.11.2014 does not specifically enable sale or transfer of the TDR, but directs grant of TDR as per Rules. To secure interests of all parties pending disposal of the Civil Appeals, we direct the recipient of the TDR to undertake return of the consideration received upon any sale or transfer of the TDR in the event the Civil Appeal(s) before Supreme Court are dismissed. An affidavit of Undertaking to this effect in the nature of personal bond(s) shall be furnished by the recipient of the TDR to the State before the sale or transfer of the TDR. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1309 Chaduranga Kanthraj Urs and Anr. v. P. Ravi Kumar and Ors. We have not expressed any opinion with regard to inter se dispute between the parties.” 16. A valiant attempt has been made by the contemnors to contend that s of this Court has been complied by passing of the dated 15.03.2024 and issuance of consequential notices and Government s. In the notices issued on 10.06.2024 and 26.06.2024 the authorities seems to be projecting a picture that the possession of the subject land has not been delivered and this is nothing but suppressing the true facts and making a false statement before this Court namely suppressio veri suggestio falsi. We say so for the simple reason that in the notices referred to hereinabove the respondents are attempting to give a picture as though possession of the land in question has not been taken, whereas in the Government dated 08.12.2022, it has been specifically mentioned that a sum of Rs. 56 crores has been provided for widening of the Bellary Road and Jayamahal Road and a Government No. UDD 56 MNY 2020 dated 04.03.2020 in the form of tender is handed over to M/s JMC Organization by issuance of a work . The said Government would also indicate that the road project is in progress. In fact, in the affidavit filed through Additional Chief Secretary Shri Rakesh Singh, it has been stated in paragraph 13 that the work is almost complete from Mekhri Circle to Jayamahal and because of the untimely rain, the completion got delayed. 17. In Writ Petition No.6585 of 2020, an affidavit dated 20.01.2023 came to be filed by BBMP through Smt. Priyadarshini, Executive Engineer, Road Infrastructure (East) BBMP, which came to be recorded by the High Court on 03.02.2023 by noticing that in paragraph 6 of the said affidavit, the deponent has made a statement that the road widening work is in progress. In fact, photographs were also appended to the said affidavit as document No.5. It was deposed in unequivocal terms that the road widening work has commenced and same came also to be recorded by the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka by observing that “it can safely be said that necessary steps are taken by BBMP for widening of roads and the work is in progress at present”.
