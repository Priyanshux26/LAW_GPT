The respondents have then referred to the in Thomson Press (India) Ltd. (supra) to argue that the Agreement to Sell lacks specific boundaries of the land, rendering it vague and unenforceable, and that possession has always remained with Sushila Devi and her heirs, now with the transferees, as held by the High Court. They further contend that the sale deeds executed during the pendency of the proceedings are not void but subject to adjudication. However, the circumstances and legal issues in Thomson Press (India) Ltd. (Supra) are not comparable to the present case. In Thomson Press (India) Ltd. (Supra), this Court dealt with the impleadment of a transferee pendente lite in a suit for specific performance and discussed the doctrine of lis pendens under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act. This Court held that a transferee pendente lite is bound by the outcome of the litigation and may be added as a party to the suit, especially if the transfer was made with knowledge of the pending proceedings and in violation of an injunction. In contrast, the present case revolves around the enforceability of the Agreement to Sell dated 30.08.1990, which sufficiently identifies the property through detailed descriptions, including khasra numbers, area, and location. The absence of explicit boundary details does not render the agreement vague or unenforceable, as the property can be clearly identified from the information provided. Moreover, the plaintiffs have been in possession of the suit property since the execution of the Agreement to Sell, actively cultivating it and paying land revenue, which contradicts the respondents’ claim that possession remained with Sushila Devi and her heirs. 2408 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 34.7. Regarding the sale deeds executed during the pendency of the suit, while such transfers are not void ab initio, they are subject to the doctrine of lis pendens and cannot prejudice the plaintiffs’ rights under the prior Agreement to Sell. The transferees acquire the property subject to the outcome of the pending litigation and cannot defeat the plaintiffs’ claim for specific performance. Therefore, the legal principles established in Thomson Press (India) Ltd. (Supra) do not apply to the present case, and the respondents’ arguments based on that do not hold in light of the facts and circumstances here. 34.8. Similarly, the respondents have also relied upon the in Yogesh Goyanka v. Govind (supra) where this Court dealt with the impleadment of a transferee pendente lite who had notice of the pending litigation. In that case, the Court held that while transfers made during the pendency of a suit are not void ab initio under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, the transferee’s rights are subservient to those of the parties in the litigation. The Court allowed the impleadment of the transferee to protect his interests, especially when there was a possibility of collusion between the original parties. However, the facts and legal issues in Yogesh Goyanka are different from the present case. In Yogesh Goyanka, the Court addressed whether a transferee pendente lite could be impleaded in a suit to protect his interests.
