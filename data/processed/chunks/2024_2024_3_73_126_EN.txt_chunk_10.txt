21. Again, after about 10 months, the petitioner invoked a pre-institution mediation before the Main Mediation Centre, Bombay High Court on 05.07.2022 in accordance with Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 making the respondent and the ICCR as party respondents. Notice was issued in the said mediation proceedings and 12.08.2022 was scheduled as the date for appearance of the parties. Upon failure of the parties to be present on the said date, 24.08.2022 was fixed as the next date for appearance. However, on the said date, the opposite parties submitted letters refusing to go into mediation and thus a non-starter report dated 24.08.2022 was issued under Rule 3(4) of the Commercial Courts (Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement) Rules, 2018. 22. After the failure of mediation as aforesaid, the petitioner sent notice for invocation of arbitration to the respondent on 24.11.2022. Vide the notice, the petitioner called upon the respondent to pay an amount of Rs 1,48,31,067/- inclusive of interest of Rs 82,13,367/- and nominated Mr V. Giri and Mr M.L. Verma, Senior Advocates practicing in this Court as its nominee arbitrators. 23. The respondent replied to the aforesaid notice vide letter dated 05.04.2023 denying all the claims raised by the petitioner in the notice dated 24.11.2022. It further stated that notwithstanding the merits, the claims were barred by limitation. The respondent also stated that the mediation proceedings initiated before the Bombay High Court were under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 which is a mandatory requirement before filing a commercial suit, and thus it was not open to the petitioner to link it to the conciliation as envisaged in the clause 21 of the franchise agreement for AELA as extracted hereinbefore. 90 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 24. The present petition then came to be filed by the petitioner on 19.04.2023 before this Court after the failure of the respondent in nominating an arbitrator as per the mutually agreed upon procedure in response to notice for invocation of arbitration. B. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 25. Mr. R. Sathish, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that this Court has the requisite jurisdiction to take necessary measures for the constitution of an arbitral tribunal under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 as the case at hand pertains to an “international commercial arbitration” within the meaning of Section 2(f) of the Act, 1996. Further, clause 21 of the AELA agreement provides for appointment of a three-membered arbitral tribunal in case a dispute arises and cannot be resolved through conciliation between the parties. 26. The counsel submitted that the petitioner, as an independent non-exclusive partner of the respondent, is entirely responsible for the conduct of the course as per clause 17.03 of the franchise agreement and is thus entitled to receive 90% of the payments received by the respondent from the ICCR after successful completion of the course. 27. The counsel argued that as the principal contract for the course was signed between the ICCR and the respondent, the grant in aid of Rs 73,53,000/- was transferred by the ICCR to the respondent on 03.10.2017 after the certificate of successful completion of the course was issued by the EOI, Kabul.
