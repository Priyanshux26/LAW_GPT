Clause (b) of sub-Section (1) of Section 43A would indicate that lease of land granted for the cultivation of sugarcane would result in the exemption of the provisions indicated in sub-Section (1) of Section 43A. In other words, the provisions indicated in sub-Section (1) of 43A is not attracted in respect of the leases of land granted for the cultivation of sugarcane or the leases of land as specifi ed in Chapter IIIA. The legislature in its wisdom, has thought it fi t to make an exception to the exemption clause as incorporated in sub-Section (3) of Section 43A(3). It enables the State Government to issue a notifi cation providing for conditions, subject to which, the leases referred to in Chapter IIIA would be governed by. Therefore, it is crucial for us to examine the notifi cation dated 14.02.1958 as amended on 08.10.1969, which came to be issued by the State Government under the enabling source of power provided in Section 43A(3).
