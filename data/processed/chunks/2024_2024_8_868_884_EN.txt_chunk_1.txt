The common thread that runs through these matters is as to whether a person who joined the services of a Nationalized Bank/Government of India undertaking based on a certificate that identified him/her as belonging to a Scheduled Caste(‘SC’)/Scheduled Tribe(‘ST’) in the State of Karnataka, pursuant to the State Government’s notifications, 872 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports would be entitled to retain the position after the caste/tribe has been de-scheduled. The situation has arisen on account of the State of Karnataka re-designating some castes under the list of SC/ST, inspite of the fact that this jurisdiction is exclusively conferred upon the Parliament by virtue of the scheme under Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India.
