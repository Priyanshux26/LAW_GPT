It is further submitted that the said Mutation Entry was purported to have been made on the basis of a report (‘wardi’) submitted to the revenue officials, but the appellants-defendants never produced such a report. Further, it is submitted that, unlike Hindu Law, children governed by Mohammedan Law have no pre-existing right; thus, there can be no oral partition of properties during the lifetime of the owner. To buttress his submission the learned senior counsel relies on Abdul Rahim & Ors. v. Sk. Abdul Zabar 6 and K. Mahammad Ghouse Sahib v. Jamila Bi & Ors.7 APPRECIATION OF LAW & ANALYSIS 12. At the outset we may remind ourselves of the observations made in regard to personal laws by J.S. Khehar the then CJI in his dissenting in Shayara Bano v. Union of India 8: “240 …Reference was also made to the definition of the term Personal Law in Conflict of Laws 188 (7th Edn., 1974) by R.H. Graveson, who defined the term as under: “The idea of the Personal Law is based on the conception of man as a social being, so that those transactions of his daily life which affect him most closely in a personal sense, such as marriage, divorce, legitimacy, many kinds of capacity, and succession, may be governed universally 3 (2004) 12 SCC 278 4 [2012] 10 SCR 1098 : (2012)13 SCC 80 5 [2010] 11 SCR 784 : (2010) 12 SCC 530 6 [2009] 4 SCR 32 : (2009) 6 SCC 160 7 1949 SCC OnLine Mad433 8 [2017] 9 SCR 797 : (2017) 9 SCC 1 930 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports by that system of law deemed most suitable and adequate for the purpose …” (emphasis in original) … 322. “Personal law” has a constitutional protection. This protection is extended to “Personal Law” through Article 25 of the Constitution. It needs to be kept in mind that the stature of “Personal Law” is that of a fundamental right. The elevation of “Personal Law” to this stature came about when the Constitution came into force. This was because Article 25 was included in Part III of the Constitution. Stated differently, “Personal Law” of every religious denomination is protected from invasion and breach, except as provided by and under Article 25.” (Emphasis supplied) 13. Mohammedan Law, being the personal law, possesses its own legal principles and regulations which govern family relationships in matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, custody and guardianship. Its distinctive feature sets it apart from other personal laws on fundamental issues. It is pertinent to examine the legal principles, if any, governing partition under Mohammedan law. 14. Tahir Mahmood,9 in his book ‘The Muslim Law of India’, 2nd Edition, Chapter 12 (Law of Inheritance) Para II, has provided for various concepts related to succession in Muslim Law which distinguish it from other personal laws: "1.
