Article 30 (Issue III), this is necessary to prevent the potential misuse of this provision. The question that now arises is when would ‘administration’ be said to have been taken away from the minority community? 179. To this end, the very concept of ‘administration’ is inherently fluid, and a specific definition is likely to be under inclusive. Determining whether a minority community exercises control over an institution is a factual question that varies from case to case. Although there is no definitive test to ascertain whether administration lies with the minority community, various judicial precedents provide indicators that may be considered relevant. 180. Similar to the test to determine ‘establishment’, these indicators alone may not conclusively establish whether the administration rests with the minority community. Instead, a cumulative and holistic analysis of these factors can assist the court in making its determination. 181. To instantiate, illustrative factors which are likely to take away administration of minority community from the institution include, inter alia: i. Management staff is not answerable to the founders, or an external person has veto over their selection.106 The lack of control over such selection would have significant weight since it is a post of prime importance around which administration revolves, i.e., he/she is the hub on which all spokes of the institution’s wheels are set around.107 ii. There are outside authorities in the governing body of the managing committee108 with wide powers over the other members;109 106 Very Rev.
