Several letters were written for furnishing crucial documents which were not forthcoming from the Insured. Learned Senior Counsel, Mr. Sanjay Jain contends that NIACL could have repudiated the claim for non supply of documents. Be that as it may, we are not called upon to decide that issue at this stage since NIACL has on its own settled the claim by their letter of 03.01.2003. When NIACL, on the facts of the present case, wrote the letter for assessing on depreciation basis, it is not a case of a clarification being sought in an incomplete report. Hence, on the facts of the present case, we do not find any violation of the Regulation 9(3). In the absence of any ambiguity we also do not find scope for applying the doctrine of contra proferentem. 78. A feeble argument was sought to be advanced to the effect that the depreciation should have been calculated on the sum insured. The s in Sri Venkateswara Syndicate v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd 2009 (8) SCC 507 and on Dharmendra Goel (supra) as well as Sumit Kumar Saha v. Reliance General Insurance Company Ltd., (2019) 16 SCC 370 cited by the Insured have no application to the facts of the present case. In Dharmendra Goel (supra) and Sumit Kumar Saha (supra), the claimants never conceded for settlement of the claim at a value lesser and different from the sum insured as in the present case. Hence, there can be no case that the sum insured should be taken as the basis for calculating depreciation. 79. As far as Sri Venkateswara Syndicate (supra) is concerned, this Court had held that the insurance company cannot go on appointing surveyors one after another so as to get a tailor-made report to the satisfaction of the officer concerned of the insurance company; and that if for any reason, the report of the surveyors is not acceptable, the insurer has to give valid reason for not accepting the report. This case has no applicability to the facts of the present matter. 320 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 80. In this case, as discussed hereinabove, the Insurer was fully justified in writing the letter dated 12.11.2002 to the Surveyor requesting them to re-assess the settlement amount. It was only the final response by the surveyors on 07.12.2002 that gave a clear picture as to the base figure and the applicable rates of the depreciation since the method of settlement was to be the depreciation basis and not reinstatement basis. 81. In view of the above, all the findings to the contrary recorded by the NCDRC are held to be erroneous and are herewith set aside. Conclusion 82. For the above reasons, we allow Civil Appeal No. 2759 of 2009 of NIACL and set aside the of the NCDRC in O.P. No. 233 of 2000 dated 05.08.2008. We hold that the claim was rightly settled by the NIACL letter dated 03.01.2003 which determined the loss amount payable at Rs.7.88 crores after applying 60% depreciation.
