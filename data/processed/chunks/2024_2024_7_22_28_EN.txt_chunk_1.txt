Three Lakhs only) with 12% interest per annum from the date of suit till realisation from the defendant no. 1. 2. Briefly stated, the facts of the case are that the appellant/plaintiff preferred a suit for specific performance of the agreement dated 26.03.1998 whereunder the parties entered into an agreement for sale of the suit property over which the defendant no. 1 had a right 24 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports by virtue of Partition Deed no. 2304/81 and Sale Deed nos. 759/93 & 1586/93 of the S.R.O. Chengannur. The defendant no. 1 agreed to sell the said property to the plaintiff for a sale consideration of Rs. 30,00,000/- (Thirty Lakhs only) and to handover the vacant possession of the suit property to the plaintiff within 06 months from the date of agreement. He received an advance sale consideration of Rs. 3,00,000/- (Three Lakhs only) from the plaintiff and also handed over the title deeds and encumbrance certificate to the plaintiff. The defendant no. 1 had availed of a loan from the defendant no. 2 - Bank by way of creating an equitable mortgage on deposit of his title deeds. Therefore, to clear the said liabilities, the defendant no. 1 received an additional amount of Rs. 15,00,000/- (Fifteen Lakhs only) from the plaintiff between the period from 26.03.1998 and 12.09.1998 and extended the period of the agreement for one year from 12.09.1998. The plaintiff averred in the suit that he was always ready and willing to pay the balance sale consideration as per the agreement but due to the laches on the part of the defendant no. 1, the sale deed could not be executed in time. In spite of repeated requests, the defendant no. 1 did not execute the sale deed, therefore, the suit was preferred. The plaintiff claimed for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative prayed for refund of the advance sale consideration of Rs. 18,00,000/- (Eighteen Lakhs only), mesne profits etc. together with interest and other incidental expenses. No relief was sought from the defendant no. 2. 3. The defendant no. 1 contested the suit by denying the whole transaction. He denied having any acquaintance with the plaintiff as also the execution of the agreement. He also stated that he is only a co-owner of the suit property which would fetch value of more than Rs. 1,00,00,000/- (One Crore only). Thus, according to the defendant no. 1, the plaintiff has raised a false claim on the basis of a non-existing agreement. It is also stated in the written statement that there were financial transactions between one K.K. Vijayadharan Pillai and defendant no. 1 during which the said K.K. Vijayadharan Pillai obtained his signatures on blank papers and cheques from him and his wife. He has also initiated criminal prosecutions and instituted civil suit against defendant no. 1.
