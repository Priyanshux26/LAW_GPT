It was also beyond three years from the deemed date of completion (i.e., 21 September 2015). 516 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (ii) Different yardstick was adopted in computing the limitation period of the claim than what was adopted for the counterclaim, which was not at all justified as both arose out of same contractual relationship. (iii) One part of the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018 that supported the counterclaim was discarded, while the other part, which favored the claimant, was accepted. This is nothing but perverse. (iv) The time for completion of the work under the contract was extended without any basis. (v) Findings in the award are self-contradictory in as much as, if challenge to the debit note for damages on account of the delay was beyond limitation, there was no logic in denying adjustment of those damages against the unpaid dues payable to Enexio under the purchase s. (vi) Material evidence qua liability for customs duty was ignored. SINGLE JUDGE’S U/S 34 OF THE 1996 ACT 19. The learned Single Judge in its and on the application, under Section 34 of the 1996 Act, charted the undisputed dates as follows: Date Events 31.03.2014 Said work ought to have been completed by Enexio. 24.08.2015 Debit note pertaining to liquidated damages was raised by Gita and OPG 21.09.2015 Deemed date of completion of said work 12.01.2016 Debit note regarding customs duty was raised by Gita and OPG 19.04.2018 Talks between adversaries namely Enexio on one side and Gita/OPG on the other side culminated in minutes of meeting (Ex.C.78) 26.05.2018 Gita/OPG offered to settle at Rs. 300 lacs as full and final settlement (Ex.

Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. 02.05.2019 Arbitral institution, namely, ICC request for arbitration (to be noted, both parties agreed that this is the date of commencement of arbitration within the meaning of section 21 of A and C Act) 15.07.2019 Gita/OPG made counter claim vide its pleadings before AT 20. After charting the relevant dates, and perusing the arbitral award, in paragraph 25 of the , the learned Single Judge observed: “25. There is a clear dichotomy in impugned award regarding the legal drill of testing limitation. AT has taken 26.05.2018 as the reckoning date, that being the date on which written offer to settle the matter was made by Gita/ OPG vide Ex. C. 79, but for testing the counter claim of Gita/OPG, AT has taken 21.09.2015 as the reckoning date or starting point of limitation, that being the date of deemed completion of said work. This Court is constrained to observe that this dichotomy is akin to classical division between science and mysticism. Therefore, this Court unhesitatingly holds that this is patently illegal and an implausible view.
