Governor in Section 3(3)(b)(i) is nothing but a ‘semantic lottery’, as the word ‘administrator’ has been used in many pre-1991 legislations which relate to subjects that now fall within the purview of the Legislative Assembly of NCTD. 24. We will examine if this apparent vesting of the power in the name of Administrator, to nominate councillors under Section 3(3)(b)(i) is by default, as the old statutory regime would have continued without incorporating the Legislative status for NCTD after the introduction of Article 239AA in 1991. 25. For giving effect to the Constitutional 69th Amendment introducing Articles 239AA and 239AB and the specific recommendations of Balakrishnan Committee for reorganizing municipalities, the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 1992 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 24th November, 1992. 26. While the Bill was pending consideration, another constitutional development took place. In its Winter Session, Parliament passed the Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Bill relating to ‘Panchayats’ and ‘Municipalities’. Part IX-A relating to Municipalities comprising of Articles 243P to Articles 243ZG came into effect from 01.06.1993. The Constitutional recognition of Municipalities, coupled with provisions granting autonomy for municipal administration, its elections, [2024] 8 S.C.R. 227 Government of NCT of Delhi v. Office of Lieutenant Governor of Delhi composition, duration, reservation, etc. had to be incorporated in the DMC Act. In to ‘harmonize’ the position, Government withdrew the pending Bill and introduced the new Bill No. 66 of 1993. The Bill was passed and was notified on 17.09.1993 as the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Amended) Act No. 67 of 1993. 27. The DMC Act, as amended in 1993 is of seminal importance. The amendment gives effect to two Constitutional developments. While the first relates to the recognition and grant of quasi-statehood to Delhi with the introduction of Articles 239AA and 239AB, the other relates to grant of a Constitutional status to the Municipalities. The statement of objects and reasons of Amendment Act 67 of 1993 record the circumstance in which amendments to the principal Act were brought about: “STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The need for reorganization of administrative and municipal set up in Delhi was being felt and the matter has been under the consideration of the Government for some time. For making an in-depth study, the Government appointed a Committee to go into the various issues connected with the administrative and municipal set up of Delhi and to recommend measures, inter alia, for streamlining of the municipal set up. The Committee on re-organisation of the Delhi set up (popularly known as Balakrishnan Committee) went into the matter in great detail and recommended a decentralized municipal administration. 2. To give effect to the recommendation of the Committee, and decision of the Government thereto, the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 1992 was introduced in Lok Sabha on 24th November, 1992. Meanwhile, during the Winter Session of the Parliament, the Constitution (Seventy-second Amendment) Bill, 1992 relating to Panchayats and the Constitution (Seventy- third Amendment) Bill, 1992, relating to the municipalities were passed. These Bills have now become Acts.
