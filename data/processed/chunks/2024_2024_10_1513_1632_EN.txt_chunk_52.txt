130. This ruling is significant because it highlights the enforceability of international human rights treaties at the regional level, compelling Mali to amend its laws to meet international obligations. By holding Mali accountable, the court reinforced the legally binding nature of the Maputo Protocol, ACRWC, and CEDAW, promoting the standardization of human rights protections across Africa. This decision also sets a precedent for other African nations, emphasizing the duty to harmonize domestic laws with international child protection standards. ii. European Union 131. In the European Union, the European Convention on Human Rights187 is a key legal instrument that impacts issues of marriage and child protection. 188 Specifically, Article 12 of the ECHR grants men and women of marriageable age the right to marry189, while Article 8 protects the right to respect for private and family life.190 These articles do not directly set a minimum age for marriage but do highlight the importance of individual autonomy and respect for personal and family life, which are relevant to child marriage discussions. Article 3, which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment, has also been interpreted to protect vulnerable individuals, including children, from practices that may be harmful or coercive, such as child marriage.191 132. Early marriage in the European Region is described as an abrupt and premature transition from childhood to adult life for the affected minors, who are predominantly girls192. At the EU level, the resolution 186 Ibid, para 125. 187 “ECHR” 188 The European Convention on Human Rights, 1950; See https://www.echr.coe.int/european-convention- on-human-rights 189 ECHR, Article 12. 190 ECHR, Article 8. 191 Ibid, Article 3. 192 Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Forced Marriage in Europe (2018), Resolution 2233, para. 2; Recognised that Early marriage thereby typically leads to restricted opportunities for education 1586 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the European Parliament of 4 October 2017 on “Ending Child Marriage” references the considerable negative effects of child marriage on the rights of children, in particular those of girls affected by the practice. 133. A landmark case in the German Federal Constitutional Court193 involved a Syrian couple who married in 2015 under Syrian law, with the wife being 14 at the time. Fleeing the Syrian conflict, they arrived in Germany, where the authorities took the young wife into care due to her minor status. Citing the Act to Prevent Child Marriages 2017, the German courts automatically invalidated the marriage under Article 13(3) no. 1 of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code (EGBGB), which prohibits the recognition of marriages if one spouse was under 16 at the time. The husband contested this, arguing that their marriage was valid under Syrian law and should be recognized in Germany. 134. The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled that, although the state has a legitimate interest in protecting minors from child marriage, the automatic invalidation of marriages involving minors under 16 was unconstitutional.194 The Court found that the law lacked provisions for dealing with the legal consequences of invalidation, and it failed to offer the possibility of validating the marriage once both parties reached adulthood.
