The accused herein were remanded on G 14.05.2020 and as such, the chargesheet ought to have been filed on or before 12.07.2020 (i.e. the sixtieth day). But the same was filed, only on 45 Locke’s, in The Second Treatise of Government, argues that sovereignty resides in the people and explains the nature of legitimate government in terms of natural rights and the social contract. H 948 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 13.07.2020 which was the 61stday of their custody. Therefore, the right to default bail accrued to the accused persons on 13.07.2020 at 12:00 AM, midnight, onwards. On that very day, the accused filed their default bail applications at 8:53 AM. The ED filed the chargesheet, later in the day, at 11:15 AM. Thus, the default bail Applications were filed well before the chargesheet. In Ravindran(supra) and Bikramjit (supra), B which followed the Constitution Bench in Sanjay Dutt(supra) it was rightly held that if the accused persons avail their indefeasible right to default bail before the chargesheet/final report is filed, then such right would not stand frustrated or extinguished by any such subsequent filing. We therefore declare that the stipulated 60/90 day remand period under C Section 167 CrPC ought to be computed from the date when a Magistrate authorizes remand. If the first day of remand is excluded, the remand period, as we notice will extend beyond the permitted 60/90 days’ period resulting in unauthorized detention beyond the period envisaged under Section 167 CrPC. In cases where the chargesheet/final report is filed on or after the 61st/91stday, the accused in our considered opinion would D be entitled to default bail. In other words, the very moment the stipulated 60/90 day remand period expires, an indefeasible right to default bail accrues to the accused. 51.Following the above discussion and opinion, the impugned of the High Court granting default bail to the respondents by applying E the proviso (a) (ii) of Section 167(2) CrPC is found to be in . Hence, we uphold the impugned dated 20.08.2020 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court. Any other pending issues arising from these appeals are to be addressed by an appropriate Bench of this Court. F Nidhi Jain Reference answered. (Assisted by : Tamana, LCRA) G H
