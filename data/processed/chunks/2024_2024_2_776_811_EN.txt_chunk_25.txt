Such corrections [2024] 2 S.C.R. 811 Shailesh Kumar v. State of U.P. (Now State of Uttarakhand) actually were put against the appellant while they indeed helped the case of the prosecution. The finding of the trial court in this regard is neither logical nor reasonable. Even on the question of motive, there is absolutely no material as witnesses did not speak about the same in their statements recorded under Section 161 of CrPC. Mere recovery of a motorcycle per se will not prove the case of the prosecution especially when it has not been proved as to how it was recovered. The evidence of PW-13 clearly shows that no date, time and proper recording have been made in the case diary. When the trial court perused the case diary for the purpose of contradicting the statement of a police officer, it ought not to have fixed the onus on the appellant. It has failed to discharge its duty enshrined under Section 172(3) of CrPC read with Section 145 or Section 161, as the case may be, of the Evidence Act. To be noted, it was brought on a request made by the appellant and the court was using it for the purpose of contradiction. 39. On a perusal of the impugned and that of the trial court in convicting the appellant, we find that the aspects discussed by us have not been looked into in a proper perspective. The appellant has certainly made out a case for acquittal. Accordingly, the conviction rendered by the High Court, confirming that of the trial court stands set aside. The appellant is acquitted of all the charges. 40. The appeal is allowed. The appellant was granted bail vide of this Court dated 06.04.2015. Hence, bail bonds stand discharged.
