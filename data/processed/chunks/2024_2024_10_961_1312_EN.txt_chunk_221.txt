File no. 4/65/58, MHA-IC, NAI 63 See Note dated 18 July 1958, Ministry of Home Affairs (IC Section) File no. 4/65/58, MHA-IC, NAI “the persons about whom the present reference has been made belong to the minority community in Pakistan and are stated to have sworn declarations renouncing their Pakistani nationality. It is also stated in the M.E.A.’s letter no. F6(44)/57-PSP, dated 14.4.58 that in most of these cases their permanent settlement in India would eventually be granted. Their present ineligibility for registration under section 5(10(a) of the Citizenship Act is therefore only technical… in cases where the applicants belonging to the minority community in Pakistan are staying on in India swearing affidavits that they have surrendered/lost their Pakistani passports, it was for the authorities to satisfy themselves that the intention was to permit the persons concerned to stay on indefinitely in India or the applicants have severed all connections with Pakistan and intend to settle down permanently in India; and in cases where the authorities are so satisfied, the applicants can be registered under section 5(1)(a).” [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1269 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 return to any other country.”64 HN Mukherjee, a member from north- east Calcutta claimed that registration would involve substantial cost and travel which would create difficulties for refugees.65 48.

State of Arunachal Pradesh,66 proceedings under Article 32 were initiated, inter alia, claiming that the citizenship applications under Article 5(1)(a) of persons belonging to the Chakma group were not being processed.

The Union Government had conveyed its decision to confer citizenship to persons belonging to the Chakma group under Section 5(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act. A three-Judge Bench observed that they can seek citizenship under Article 5(1)(a) and directed that the applications must be forwarded by the Collector to the Registering Authority. In Committee for Citizenship Rights of the Chakmas of Arunachal Pradesh v. State of Arunachal Pradesh,67 proceedings under Article 32 were instituted requiring the State to comply with the earlier directions on grant of citizenship to Chakma and Hajong refugees who migrated from Assam to Arunachal Pradesh. The petition was allowed directing the Government of India and the State of Arunachal Pradesh to finalise the conferment of citizenship rights to persons of the Chakmas and Hajong groups.68 49.
