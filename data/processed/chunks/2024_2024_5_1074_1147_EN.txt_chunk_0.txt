[2024] 5 S.C.R. 1074 : 2024 INSC 436 Ravikumar Dhansukhlal Maheta & Anr. v. High Court of Gujarat & Ors. (Writ Petition (c) No. 432 of 2023) 17 May 2024 [Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, CJI, J.B. Pardiwala* and Manoj Misra, JJ.] Issue for Consideration (i) What is the scope of principle of the ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ in service jurisprudence; and (ii) Whether promotion of Civil Judges (Senior Division) to the cadre of District Judges in accordance with Rule 5(1) of the Gujarat State Judicial Service Rules, 2005 and the Recruitment Notice dated 12.04.2022 issued by the High Court of Gujarat is contrary to the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ as laid down in All India Judges’ Association (3). Headnotes† Constitution of India – Art. 32 and Art.226 – Maintainability of the Writ Petition under Article 32 – A preliminary objection was raised as regards the maintainability of the writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, on the ground that the petitioners have an efficacious alternative remedy available to them under Article 226 of the Constitution: Held: Two judicial officers of the rank of Civil Judge (Senior Division) governed by the Gujarat State Judicial Service Rules, 2005 have invoked the jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution – The availability of an alternative remedy does not in any manner affect the maintainability of the writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution – The rule behind relegating a party to first avail the alternative remedy before knocking the doors of this Court is a rule of self-restraint that is exercised by this Court as a matter of convenience – Further, wherever the facts of the case are not in dispute, and the issue involves the interpretation of rules which are of significant importance having a far-reaching effect, it would be a fit case for this Court to exercise its discretion and entertain the writ petition under Article 32 even if there is an alternative remedy available.
