Civil Appeal No 13047- 13048 of 2017. 208 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Commercial Tax to the assessee on the basis of the above referred newly added section 84A, for revising the assessment for the fi nancial year 2008- 09 made by dated March 30, 2013. The original period of limitation as provided under Section 75 of the Gujarat VAT Act for issuing notice was of three years from the date of the assessment , i.e., March 30, 2013, which had lapsed on March 30, 2016. However, by virtue of the newly enacted section 84A, the period spent from the date of the decision of the High Court up to the date of the decision of this court was to be excluded in computing the aforesaid period of three years, referred to under Section 75 of the Gujarat VAT Act. This development resulted in a challenge to the validity of the amendment. The state had sought to urge that being a validating enactment, which sought to cure the defect found earlier, and given that it operated retrospectively, there is no question of the amendment being invalid. 112. There are undoubtedly several s of this court such as Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Broach Borough Municipality45 Government of Andhra Pradesh v. Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd46; Ujagar Prints v. Union of India47 and several others, which hold that a purely curative and validating enactment, if made retrospective, is unexceptionable. However, it has been held by this court, in Kerala State Electricity Board v. Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd.48: “... Both the 1910 Act as well as the 1948-Act are existing law as contemplated under article 372 of the Constitution. An existing law continues to be valid even though the legislative power with respect to the subject-matter of the existing law might be in a diff erent list under the Constitution from the list under which it would have fallen under the Government of India Act, 1935. But after the Constitution came into force an existing law could be amended or repealed only by the Legislature which would be competent to enact that law if it were to be newly enacted...” 45 1970 (1) SCR 388 46 [1975] Supp (1) SCR 394 47 [1988] Supp 3 SCR770 48 [ 1976 ] 1 SCR 552 THE STATE OF TELANGANA & ORS. v. M/S TIRUMALA 209 CONSTRUCTIONS [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] As noted earlier, Ramakrishna Ram Nath (supra) held that the power to repeal is co-extensive with the power to amend, or make a law. It was also held that “(T)he power has to be seen at the time when the repealing legislation is being enacted. […] However, the Legislature should have the competence at the time when such a repealing law is being enacted.” 113. In the present case, the retrospective effect, given to the amendment, which was brought into force, with eff ect from 2006, cannot in any way save it, after the coming into force of the GST laws, on 01.07.2017.
