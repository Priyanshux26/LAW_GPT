All these off ences are cognizable in nature and basic ingredients being there in the FIR, the High Court clearly erred in quashing the FIR. Whether the off ences are proved or not would be a subject matter of the Trial and before that of the investigation as to whether a triable case is made out or not by the investigating agency but in any case, was not a case where FIR was liable to be quashed. RUCHIR RASTOGI v. PANKAJ RASTOGI AND OTHERS 925 ETC. [VIKRAM NATH, J.] 16. The defence taken by the respondent if adverted to and dealt with by this Court, could cause serious prejudice to them in the investigation and also the trial as such we are not delving into the same. However, we would refer to the couple of objections taken, for example, the dispute regarding the arbitration award and its execution. Even in the absence thereof once there was an injunction granted to preserve the property, respondent No.1 could not have dealt with the same and, at the outset, he should have informed the appellant about the s passed under section 9 of the 1996 Act. He should have refrained himself from surrendering the possession of the shop in question. His participation in the crime prima facie, therefore, cannot be ruled out. 17. For all the reasons recorded above, the appeals succeed and are allowed. The impugned of the High Court is set aside. Law to take its own course. The matter to proceed with respect to the FIR in question in accordance with law. It is however made clear that any observations made in this are only for the purposes of deciding the issue raised and the same may not infl uence the investigation or the trial which shall proceed independently and be decided on the evidence adduced.
