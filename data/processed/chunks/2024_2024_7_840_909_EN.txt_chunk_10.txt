Thus, the discharge voucher could be said to have been signed under coercion, undue influence, and without free will and [2024] 7 S.C.R. 855 SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Krish Spinning volition of the respondent. The respondent further stated that it had sent the protest letter dated 25.10.2019 immediately after receiving the final instalment in relation to the claim arising out of the second fire incident. The respondent further stated that in the event of the appellant’s denial or failure to pay the balance amount within a period of 15 days, the legal notice should be treated as notice invoking arbitration. 19. The appellant replied to the aforesaid legal notice on 16.03.2020 refuting the allegations made by the respondent, alleging them to be mala fide and an after-thought. The appellant stated that the discharge voucher signed by the respondent was unqualified and on his own free will and volition. It was further stated by the appellant that the amount being claimed by the respondent was not due in the first place, thereby making the dispute not one of quantum but one of liability, and therefore the arbitration agreement would not be attracted to the dispute raised. 20. As the parties were unable to arrive at any amicable resolution of the dispute, and as no arbitrator was nominated by the appellant in response to the notice invoking arbitration, the respondent, on 25.10.2021 filed a petition for the appointment of arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter “the Act, 1996”) before the High Court. 21. The case of the respondent before the High Court was that as against the loss of Rs 1,76,19,967/- suffered by it, the appellant company paid only Rs 84,19,579/- and thus it was not completely indemnified. It was also argued that the appellant had not explained why at the time of obtaining the consent letter an amount of Rs 92,00,388/- was deducted from the total amount claimed. 22. The appellant, on the other hand, contested the arbitration petition filed by the respondent on the ground that the claim raised by the respondent herein was stale and having once signed the consent letter dated 24.12.2018, it was not open for it to turn around and raise a dispute. The appellant also contended that it was open for the court to look into the question of arbitrability at the stage of deciding the Section 11 petition. 23. The High Court, having regard to the aforesaid submissions of the parties, held that the dispute in question was falling in the realm of 856 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports adjudication and the same is the function to be discharged by an arbitrator. Placing reliance on the decision of this Court in Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. v. Dicitex Furnishing Ltd. reported in (2020) 4 SCC 621, the High Court held that if the dispute existing between the parties could be referred to arbitration under the arbitration agreement, then appointment of arbitrator has to follow.
