We have noticed that Section 51 has provided that any sale of property, which is waqf property, without G the previous sanction of the Board, would be void. The two sales in this case took place prior to 01.01.1996. The first sale is dated 14.10.1960 whereas the second sale is dated 13.09.1974. 39. Section 112 of the Act provides for repeal and sales. It reads as follows: H SABIR ALI KHAN v. SYED MOHD. AHMAD ALI KHAN AND 975 OTHERS [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] “112. Repeal and savings. —(1) The Wakf Act, 1954 (29 of 1954) A and the Wakf (Amendment) Act, 1984 (69 of 1984) are hereby repealed. (2) Notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or any action taken under the said Acts shall be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of this Act. B (3) If, immediately before the commencement of this Act, in any State, there is in force in that State, any law which corresponds to this Act that corresponding law shall stand repealed: Provided that such repeal shall not affect the previous operation C of that corresponding law, and subject thereto, anything done or any action taken in the exercise of any power conferred by or under the corresponding law shall be deemed to have been done or taken in the exercise of the powers conferred by or under this Act as if this Act was in force on the day on which such things were done or action was taken.” D 40. Section 49B of the 1960 Act is pari materia with Section 52 of the Act. In other words, it provided that the Board may, if a transfer is made contravening Section 49A of the 1960 Act, send requisition to the Collector for recovery of possession. Section 49A of the 1960 Act also provided on similar terms as provided in Section 51(1) of the Act that for E a sale of property comprised in a waqf, previous sanction of the Board was necessary. As far as Sections 49A and 49B came to be inserted by Act 28 of 1971 and the second sale took place in 1974, which is after the insertion of Sections 49A and 49B in the 1960 Act, therefore, the power, indeed, vested with the Board to take action for recovery of possession under Section 49B. Under Section 112(3) of the Act, we proceed on the F basis that the 1960 Act would stand repealed. However, the proviso declares that the repeal would not affect the previous operation of the corresponding law. The corresponding law, in this case is Section 49A read with Section 49B. Action taken in the exercise of the power thereunder, is to be deemed as taken in the exercise of powers under the G Act. The powers under the Act must be treated as flowing from Section 52 of the Act. For the said purpose, the proviso to Section 112(3) provides that the provisions in the Act, which in this case would be Section 52, must be treated as being on the Statute Book.
