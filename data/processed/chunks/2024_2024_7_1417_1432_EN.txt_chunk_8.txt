To put the record straight with reference to the amount of rent claimed to have been received by the defendant No.3(a), it is relevant to refer to the fact that the learned Additional District Judge vide dated 24.05.2010 had appointed the receiver. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1429 Rajinder Kaur (Deceased) Through Legal Heir Usha v. Gurbhajan Kaur (Deceased) Through Lrs Upinder Kaur and Others The receiver visited the spot (property in question) and informed that none of the tenants as pointed by defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla was occupying the premises. The Trial Court in its passed on 27.02.2012 found that the documents (rent notes as were available in the record of the Trial Court)12 produced by defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla showing tenancy of the portion of the building in his possession has doubt of genuineness thereof. It was also noticed that the plaintiff was ready to pay ₹1,50,000/- per month as rent for the portion in possession of defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla. Hence, it would not be possible that he would rent out the same @ ₹5,800/- per month. Be that as it may, this matter will require examination by the Trial Court in the course of passing the final decree. 19. As far as defendant Nos.15 to 19 are concerned, admittedly they are purchasers of the property from defendant Nos.6 to 9 during the pendency of the suit. It is claimed by them that they are carrying on their own business in the portion in their possession and have not let out the same to anyone. Hence, not generating any income therefrom by way of letting out the property. The First Appellate Court held that they are owners to the extent of 15% share in the property and are stated to be in possession of front half portion on the ground floor of the show-room (property in question), stated to be about 1,050 sq. ft. The First Appellate Court had accepted their contention, relieving them from liability to render accounts on the ground that they are in possession of the suit property to the extent of their ownership, a fact yet to be determined. The value of the portion of different floors of the suit property may be different, hence, the value of shares. 20. As noticed earlier, the issue raised by the plaintiff seeking partition of the joint property before this Court is only with reference to rendition of accounts by the defendant No.3(a) and defendant Nos. 15 to 19. The opinion expressed by the High Court in the impugned , that both of them are not liable to render any accounts, deserves to be set aside. 12 (i) Dated 10.10.2008 executed between S.C.
