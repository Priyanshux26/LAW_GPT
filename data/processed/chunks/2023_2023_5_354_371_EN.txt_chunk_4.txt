The same metamorphosed into First Information Report in Crime No. 317/2017 at Bagalgunte Police Station, Bangalore City (hereinafter referred to as the “FIR”) under Section 3(1)(15) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (hereinafter referred to as the “SC/ H 360 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A ST Act”) and Sections 427, 420, 419, 406, 471, 468, 448 and 120B of the IPC. The Managing Director of GMID, namely Gulam Mustafa, the appellant before us is arrayed as Accused No. 18 in the FIR. 9. Insofar as the development on the land is concerned, learned counsel for the appellant has stated that in 2017, the construction of the B apartments was completed, sale deeds executed in favour of the respective allottees, and these allottees are residing in their apartments thereafter. 10. The appellant moved a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the “Code”) on 28.05.2019 before the High Court for quashing the FIR. The said petition C was numbered Criminal Petition No. 3788 of 2019, and the High Court, by dated 07.08.2019, while issuing notice, granted ad-interim direction staying further proceedings in the FIR as far as the appellant was concerned. However, Criminal Petition No. 3788 of 2019 was ultimately dismissed on 23.02.2021, leading to the institution of the instant D appeal. SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANT: 11. Learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that firstly, the matter is purely civil in nature as it raises questions relating to title of the land on which GMID had entered into a JDA and constructed E apartments after following the due procedure in law. 12. It was submitted that not one but multiple authorities, including revenue authorities, the BBMP, etc. had given requisite permission/s for construction. Moreover, it was submitted that initial civil litigation was also decided in favour of the original land-owners, with whom GMID F had signed the JDA. 13. The complaint resulting into the FIR, submitted learned counsel, was at the behest of Venkatesh, who, mischievously, taking advantage of the similarity in the old survey number of his land with the new survey number of the land involved herein, had blatantly abused the process of G the court. It was submitted that even when the initial written complaint was filed before the police, GMID was arrayed as Accused No. 19, but in the consequent FIR, the appellant was made party thereto, by naming him as the Accused No.18. 14. It was submitted that the FIR is a complete abuse of process H as it has been filed by a family member of the person, who was SRI GULAM MUSTAFA v. THE STATE OF KARNATAKA & ANR. 361 [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] unsuccessful in various proceedings against the original land-owners and A the builder (GMID), where they could not succeed and that is the reason why Venkatesh had put up his illiterate mother to file a false and frivolous complaint levelling false allegations. It was submitted that the issue of title of the property has attained finality in terms of the decree passed by the Civil Court and no appeal has been filed against the same.
