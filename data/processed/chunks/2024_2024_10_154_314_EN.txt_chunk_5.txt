[Paras 156, 222] Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s.30 – Statutory presumption of culpable mental state under – Reasons therefor, stated – Principle of Foundational Facts: Held: Statutory presumption of culpable mental state is in view of the exigency posed by the difficulty that exists in establishing certain 162 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
