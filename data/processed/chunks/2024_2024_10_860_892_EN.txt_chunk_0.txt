[2024] 10 S.C.R. 860 : 2024 INSC 781 Bank of Rajasthan Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax (Civil Appeal Nos. 3291-3294 of 2009) 16 October 2024 [Abhay S. Oka* and Pankaj Mithal, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Issue arose as regards the treatment to be given to broken period interest, whether a deduction of the broken period interest can be claimed by the Bank, purchaser of the government Securities. Headnotes† Income Tax Act, 1961 – s.28 – Interest on securities – Interest on Held to Maturity (HTM) government securities – Interest for the broken period, if allowed as a deduction: Held: As the securities were treated as stock-in-trade, the interest on the broken period cannot be considered as capital expenditure and will have to be treated as revenue expenditure, which can be allowed as a deduction – Whether the Bank holds the HTM security as investment or stock-in-trade will depend on the facts of each case – If it is found that HTM Security is held as an investment, the benefit of broken period interest will not be available and if it is held as a trading asset, deduction for broken period interest can be claimed – If deduction on account of broken period interest is not allowed, the broken period interest as capital expense will have to be added to the acquisition cost of the securities, which will then be deducted from the sale proceeds when such securities are sold in the subsequent years – Profit earned from the sale would be reduced by the amount of broken period interest.
