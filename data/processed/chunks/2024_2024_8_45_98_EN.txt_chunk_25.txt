It was averred that malpractice was widespread in Hazaribagh, Jharkhand, Patna, Bihar, and Godhra, Gujarat. The data provided by NTA in relation to Hazaribagh for 2024 is as below: 82 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports a. 2733 candidates in total appeared for the exam; b. 126 candidates are within Rank 1,08,000. This indicates a success rate of 4.6%; and c. 58 candidates are within Rank 56,000. This indicates a success rate of 2.1%. Further, the statistics from previous editions of the NEET indicate that the success rate (relative to the total number of available seats) for Hazaribagh was 7.2% in 2022 and 6.0% in 2023. When these figures are compared with the success rate for 2024 which is 4.6%, no abnormality becomes evident. To the contrary, the success rate for this year is lower than for the past two years. 75. Similar data for Patna for 2024 is encapsulated below: a. 48,643 candidates in total appeared for the exam. The exam was conducted in 70 centres across the city; b. 2691 candidates are within Rank 1,08,000. This indicates a success rate of 5.5%; and c. 1482 candidates are within Rank 56,000. This indicates a success rate of 3.0%. In 2022, the success rate (relative to the total number of available seats) was 8.9% and in 2023, the success rate was 7.7%. In Patna, too, the success rate for this year (5.5%) is lower than for the past two years. Even otherwise, there is no irregularity which comes to light. 76. The numbers for Godhra for 2024 are as follows: a. 2484 candidates in total appeared for the exam. The exam was conducted in 2 centres; b. 21 candidates are within Rank 1,08,000. This indicates a success rate of 0.8%; and c. 13 candidates are within Rank 56,000. This indicates a success rate of 0.05%. To compare, the success rate (relative to the total number of available seats) in Godhra was 1.5% in 2022 and 2.1% in 2023. Hence, in Godhra, fewer candidates are within the zone in 2024. There are no other deviations in the data which are cause for concern and which meet the standard of indicating a systemic malaise. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 83 Vanshika Yadav v. Union of India & Ors. 77. From the above figures, it becomes clear that there are no abnormalities in the results for 2024 when compared with the results for the past two years. The report of the Director of IIT, Madras also supports the conclusion of this Court. The report stated that there were no “abnormal indications” in the results for this year, when compared to previous years. It also stated that “analysis shows that there is neither any indication of mass malpractice nor a localized set of candidates being benefitted leading to abnormal scores.” Hence, an analysis of the results does not lend support to the case of the petitioners who seek the cancellation of the exam. The leak of the paper does not appear to be widespread or systemic.
