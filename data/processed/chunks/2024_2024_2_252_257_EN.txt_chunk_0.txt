(Criminal Appeal No. 758 of 2024) 05 February 2024 [Vikram Nath and Satish Chandra Sharma, JJ.] Issue for Consideration The High Court, if justified in refusing to quash the docket which re-initiated criminal proceedings against the appellants for offences u/s. 420, 498A, 506 IPC and u/s. 3, 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. Headnotes Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 482 – Quashing of the docket – Matter pertaining to matrimonial disputes, wherein the High Court refused to quash the docket which re-initiated criminal proceedings against the husband and in-laws for offences u/s. 420, 498A, 506 IPC and u/s. 3, 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 – Correctness: Held: A bare perusal of the complaint, statement of witnesses’ and the charge-sheet shows that the allegations against the husband and in-laws are wholly general and omnibus in nature; even if taken in their entirety, they do not prima facie make out a case against the husband and in-laws – Material on record neither discloses any particulars of the offences alleged nor discloses the specific role/allegations assigned to any of the husband and in-laws in the commission of the offences – Husband and in- laws approached the High Court on inter alia grounds that the proceedings were re-initiated on vexatious grounds and even highlighted the commencement of divorce proceedings by the wife, as such the High Court had a duty to consider the allegations with great care and circumspection so as to protect against the danger of unjust prosecution – Thus, the material on record being wholly insufficient to proceed against the husband and in-laws, the impugned s and the docket set aside and the criminal proceedings against the husband and in-laws quashed.
