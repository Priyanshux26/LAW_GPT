It was in NM Thomas v. State of Kerala,61 that this Court undertook an expansive and substantive reading of the equality code. In that case, proceedings were instituted for challenging the constitutional validity of Rule 13AA of the Kerala 58 AIR 1951 SC 229 59 Article 15(4) was included in the Constitution by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act 1951 to overcome the in Champakam Dorairajan. 60 [1963] Supp. 1 SCR 439 : AIR 1963 SC 649 61 (1976) 2 SCC 310; the seeds of the expansive approach were sowed by Justice Subba Rao in T Devadasan. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1365 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. State and Subordinate Services Rules 1958 by which the qualifying criteria was relaxed for candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The majority constituting the seven- Judge Bench interposed the principle of reasonable classification in Article 14 to Article 16(1)62 and observed that Article 16(4) is not an exception to the principle of equality of opportunity. Article 16(4), in the opinion of the Court, clarifies and explains the principle in Article 16(1).63 Chief Justice Ray observed that Article 16(1) will not be violated when the rule ensures “equality of representation in the services for unrepresented classes after satisfying the basic needs of efficiency of administration”.64 Chief Justice Ray’s opinion rests on two conceptual foundations. First, the goal of Article 16(1) is to ensure equality of representation while maintaining efficiency of service; and second, the beneficiaries must be the unrepresented class. Equality of opportunity was framed in the language of equal representation subject to these two caveats. Justice K K Mathew adopted a different approach. The learned Judge broke down the conceptual foundation of the equality provision in the following manner: a. A criterion which is relevant to the apportionment of the good (that is, services) must be adopted;65 b. It must be determined if the relevant criterion leads to an a priori exclusion of a certain class. The State is required to identify if persons of all classes have an equal chance of satisfying the chosen criteria;66 and c. There is a violation of the right to equal opportunity if the relevant criterion leads to a priori exclusion. In that case, a compensatory provision must be made to offset the disadvantage.67 51. In his concurring opinion, Justice Krishna Iyer observed that when two interpretations of Article 16(1) are available, that which ensures equal participation and fair representation in administration must be chosen.68 62 (1976) 2 SCC 310 [Ray CJI, 21] 63 (1976) 2 SCC 310 [Ray CJI, 37] 64 (1976) 2 SCC 310 [Ray CJI, 45] 65 (1976) 2 SCC 310 [Justice Mathew, 55] 66 (1976) 2 SCC 310 [ Justice Mathew, 58-59] 67 (1976) 2 SCC 310 [ Justice Mathew, 74] 68 (1976) 2 SCC 310 [Justice Krishna Iyer, 120] 1366 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 52. Thus, at the end of the first phase, it was clarified that the Constitution espouses a substantive vision of equality where reservation is not an exception but, as Justice Krishna Iyer observed in NM Thomas (supra), an “illustration of constitutionally sanctified” classification.69 However, the Judges varied on the purpose of Article 16(1).
