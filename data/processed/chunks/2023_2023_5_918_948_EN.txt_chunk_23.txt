Let us now test the argument propounded by the learned ASG, that if an accused is produced before a Magistrate at 11:50 PM on a given day, say, 01.01.2023, and if Section 9 of the General Clauses Act G 40 Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951) 41 See the German Constitution (1945) and the Helsinki Accords (1975). 42 Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113 (1876) 43 Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113 (1876), page 142. Munn v. Illinois- cited with approval by Supreme Court of India, in case of Kharak Singh vs. State of UP (1964) 1 SCR 332 and later in KS Puttaswamy vs. UoI (2017) 10 SCC 1. H 44 Francis Corallie Mullin vs. The Administrator, 1981 AIR 746. (per PN Bhagwati J.) ENFORCEMENT DIRECTORATE, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA v. 947 KAPIL WADHAWAN & ANR. ETC. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] is not applied, then only a few minutes of that day would have to be A counted as an entire day for purposes of calculating the remand period. In such a situation a short ten minute window or less, would be available for the police for custodial investigation. On this it must be observed that production of an accused before a Magistrate say at 11:50 PM, has more to do with police producing the accused within the prescribed 24 B hour period as mandated under Section 57 CrPC. Therefore, the legal position vis-à-vis proviso (a) of Section 167 (2) CrPC, cannot be resolved in favour of the investigation agencies, with such an extreme example. As stated earlier, when the day of remand is included in the stipulated period under Section 167(2), the same would encourage the prosecution to promptly comply with Section 57 CrPC. The leaning C towards the accused’s right to personal liberty by reducing the 60 day period to something more than 59 days, and a few hours, is based on the constitutional protection afforded to an accused under Article 22(2) and Article 21. In this way, the Code’s application in dealing with an accused would be consistent with the inviolable right of personal liberty and dignity, D as explained above. 49. Returning now to the English philosopher John Locke, with whose words this commenced,45 we have elected to answer this reference by endorsing that interpretation of law which advances the cause of justice and freedom. The relevant provisions of the CrPC E are the laws, that are essential to protect an individual’s liberty. It regulates the societal need for limited detention of persons charged with serious offences. We have therefore adopted the interpretation whereby personal liberty is safeguarded and justice would not be compromised and in the grand scheme of things, the unjustified detention of individuals is eschewed. As a court of law, once the legal stipulations of the Code are F satisfied, we are duty bound to apply the law and prevent unlawful detention and protect personal liberty. 50. Since there exists vacuum in the application and details of Section 167 CrPC, we have opted for an interpretation which advances the cause of personal liberty.
