Initially, candidature of all those who did not fulfi l the eligibility criteria as per 2014 Rules was rejected. However, several of them approached the Tribunal. On 30.06.2017, in O.A. No.2830 of 2017, the Tribunal passed an interim that candidates holding one year diploma, though with a diff erent nomenclature than the one prescribed, may be considered subject to decision of the State Government on its equivalence with the one prescribed. Pursuant thereto, on 21.08.2017 the State Government issued a clarifi cation that all candidates having one year diploma in computer or higher education in Computer Science / Application / IT from any private institution may also be considered for selection. (ii) The letter dated 21.08.2017 is clarifi catory in nature and within the scope of powers conferred by Rule 18 of the 2014 Rules, and was necessitated on account of ambiguity in the 2014 Rules. The clarifi cation widens the zone of consideration by including those who were successful in the written examination and typing test, therefore, it causes no prejudice to the interest of the State. (iii) The clarifi cation was approved by the State cabinet in its meeting held on 18.09.2017, which had the power to relax the Rules under Rule 846 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 18 of the 2014 Rules. Such relaxation could be without consultation of the Commission in light of Regulation 3 of the 1973 Regulations. Moreover, the clarifi cation was issued in public interest considering the urgency to fi ll the vacant posts. (iv) The State Govt. vide letter dated 19.03.2018 directed the Commission to implement the clarifi cation dated 21.08.2017 in respect of Post Code 556 also, as both (i.e., Post Code 447 and Post Code 556) required same set of qualifi cations and were to be fi lled under the 2014 Rules. (v) The State has power to prescribe qualifi cations for the recruitment. Essential qualifi cations for appointment to a post are for the employer to prescribe and the question of equivalence falls outside the domain of judicial review. In this regard, reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in Maharashtra Public Service Commission vs. Sandeep Sudhakarrao Lavhekar24. (vi) The State can even withdraw an advertisement and proceed afresh under new set of Rules. In this regard, reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in State of M.P. vs. Raghuveer Singh Yadav25 (vii) Recruitment under Post Code 447 is complete. If the appointments are set aside, it would create administrative chaos. In the recruitment process under Post Code 556, out of 1156 posts that were advertised, 626 posts have been fi lled and 530 posts remain unfi lled. 19. On behalf of Intervenors (I.A. No.100627 of 2022), who claim to possess qualifi cations higher than prescribed by the Rules, Mr. Tarun Gupta argued that they possess qualifi cations which can be considered higher than the prescribed qualifi cations and, therefore, they ought to have been considered as eligible even though qua them no specifi c clarifi cation was issued.
