12. We have heard learned senior counsels for the parties and have also perused the material on record. 13. The core question to be decided in the present appeals is as to what would be a fair and just compensation so as to do justice between the 2 (2008) 14 SCC 745 THE CENTRAL WAREHOUSING CORP. v. THAKUR DWARA KALAN 931 UL-MARUF BARAGLAN WALA (DEAD) [VIKRAM NATH, J.] parties that is to say that land owners may get a fair and reasonable amount of compensation for losing their land, and at the same time balancing the State exchequer by not awarding an amount which may be in excess of the market value so as not to put an additional burden on the appellant which is a State entity. 14. It is an admitted position that there is no material in the form of exemplars of the relevant time that is the date of the notifi cation under Section 4 of the 1894 Act so as to facilitate determination of the market value. Whatever sale deeds have been referred by the appellant, cannot be taken as exemplars to determine the market value for which the reasons given by the High Court are reasonable and we have no reason to interfere with the same. Thus, we have to fall back upon the of the Reference Court dated 30.08.2000which related to an acquisition of the year 1989. This Reference Court of 30.08.2000 has been relied upon by the Reference Court and the High Court in the present case. The question to be determined would be as to at what rate the annual increase be applied? The Reference Court applied 12% fl at rate increase, whereas High Court applied 15% cumulative. 15. The law on the point of annual increase whether on cumulative basis or non-cumulative basis and the rate of annual increase to be applied are thus to be considered. Based upon the same a balance and equitable compensation needs to be determined in the present case. 16. The following cases have been relied upon by the parties with respect to determining the just compensation. i) General Manager, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited vs. Rameshbhai Jivanbhai Patel and Another (supra), ii) Ashrafi and Others Vs. State of Haryana and Others3, iii) Narbadi Devi &Ors. Vs. State of Haryana4, iv) Ramrao Shankar Tapase vs. Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation and Others5, 3 (2013) 5 SCC 527 4 SLP(c)Nos.20531-20565 of 2014, (22.08.2014- ) 5 (2022) 7 SCC 563 932 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. v) State of Haryana and Another vs. Subhash Chander and Others6 17. The case which was referred to by the High Court was Rameshbhai Jivanbhai Patel (supra). It no doubt referred to determining compensation on the basis of annual increase with cumulative eff ect, but at the same time it had put a caution that such annual increase can be taken only for 4-5 years as beyond that it would be unsafe to uniformly apply the same rate for increase and that too with cumulative eff ect.
