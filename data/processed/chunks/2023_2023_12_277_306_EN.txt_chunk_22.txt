However, we deem it appropriate to observe that the of this Court in Thressiamma Jacob and Others (supra) is prior to the enforcement of the Amendment Act, 2015 and the Concession Rules, 2016. The amendments made by the Amendment Act, 2015 were not subject matter of decision in the said case and would have to be considered by the courts and the authorities as a ’s binding ratio depends upon the legal provisions considered, interpreted and applied in a given . When the law changes by an amendment in the legislation, the amended legal provisions have to be considered, interpreted and applied. Accordingly, and for the reasons stated, we partly allow the present appeal and set aside the impugned with a direction that the government of West Bengal will execute a mining lease for 20.87 acres of land in favour of the Respondent No. 1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih. The Writ Petition No. 20309 (W) of 2016 will be treated as allowed to the extent as indicated above. The claim of the Respondent No. 1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih towards the balance area for the grant of mining lease will be treated as rejected and dismissed.
