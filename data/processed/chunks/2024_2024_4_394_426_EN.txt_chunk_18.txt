Once it is found that it was a case of improper acceptance, as there was misinformation or suppression of material i`nformation, one can state that question of rejection in such a case was only deferred to a later date. When the Court gives such a finding, which would have resulted in rejection, the effect would be same, namely, such a candidate was not entitled to contest and the election is void. Otherwise, it would be an anomalous situation that even when criminal proceedings under Section 125-A of the Act can be initiated and the selected candidate is criminally prosecuted and convicted, but the result of his election cannot be questioned. This cannot be countenanced.’ 35. In Lok Prahari through its General Secretary S.N. Shukla vs. Union of India and others14, this Court observed that non-disclosure 14 [2018] 2 SCR 892 : (2018) 4 SCC 699 [2024] 4 S.C.R. 419 Karikho Kri v. Nuney Tayang and Another of assets and sources of income of candidates and their associates would constitute a corrupt practice falling under the heading ‘undue influence’, as defined under Section 123 (2) of the Act of 1951. In S. Rukmini Madegowda vs. State Election Commission and others15, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court observed that a false declaration with regard to the assets of a candidate, his/her spouse or dependents, would constitute a corrupt practice irrespective of its impact on the election of the candidate as it may be presumed that a false declaration would impact the election. 36. In Mairembam Prithviraj alias Prithviraj Singh vs. Pukhrem Sharatchandra Singh16, this Court noted that there is a difference between improper acceptance of the nomination of a returned candidate as opposed to improper acceptance of the nomination of any other candidate. It was observed that a mere finding that there has been an improper acceptance of a nomination would not be sufficient for a declaration that the election is void under Section 100(1)(d)(i) and there has to be further pleading and proof that the result of the election of the returned candidate was materially affected, but there would be no necessity of any such proof in the event of the nomination of the returned candidate being declared as having been improperly accepted, especially in a case where there are only two candidates in the fray. 37. In Association for Democratic Reforms and another vs. Union of India and others17, a Constitution Bench affirmed that, in terms of the earlier s in Association for Democratic Reforms and another (supra) and People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) and another vs. Union of India and another18, the right of voters to information, which is traceable to Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, is built upon the jurisprudence that information which furthers democratic participation must be provided to citizens and voters have a right to information which would enable them to cast their votes rationally and intelligently because voting is one of the foremost forms of democratic participation.
