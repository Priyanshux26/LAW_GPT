(Concurring) Principle of temporal unreasonableness cannot be applied to a situation where the classification is still relevant to the objective of the provision – Process of detection and conferring citizenship in Assam is a long-drawn out process spanning many decades – To strike it down due to lapse of time is to ignore the context and object of the provision. [Para 120] – Held: (per Pardiwala, J.) (Dissenting) Absence of any temporal limits on the applicability of s.6A has the effect of rendering it manifestly arbitrary and constitutionally invalid – Although the mandate of timely detection and deportation of illegal immigrants was the fundamental premise on which the Assam Accord was signed, yet, this intention recorded in the [2024] 10 S.C.R. 977 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 Accord, was never translated statutorily, due to a faulty mechanism prescribed u/s.6A(3), either due to inadvertence or advertence of the legislature – s.6A has acquired unconstitutionality with the efflux of time – Efflux of time has brought to light the element of manifest arbitrariness in the scheme of s.6A(3) which fails to provide a temporal limit to its applicability – Neither s.6A nor the rules made thereunder prescribe any outer time-limit for the completion of detection of all such persons who belong to the 1966-71 stream and are eligible to avail the benefits of s.6A (3) – Absence of any prescribed time-limit for detection of foreigners of the 1966-71 stream has two-fold adverse consequences-it relieves the state from the burden of effectively identifying, detecting, and deleting from the electoral rolls, in accordance with law, all immigrants of the 1966-71 stream, and it incentivises the immigrants belonging to the 1966-71 stream to continue to remain on the electoral rolls for an indefinite period and only get themselves registered u/s.6A once detected by a competent tribunal – Thus, the manner in which the provision is worded, counter-serves the very purpose of its enactment, which is the speedy and effective identification of foreigners of the 1966-71 stream, their deletion from the electoral rolls, registration with the registering authority and conferring of regular citizenship – Working mechanism of s.6A(3) goes against its avowed objective – Mechanism prescribed for giving effect to s.6A is imbued with the idea of temporal limitations and in the absence of temporal limits on the period during which s.6A is made applicable, the provision counter serves the object it was enacted with – To allow s.6A to continue indefinitely for all times to come would tantamount to taking a reductive and one-sided view of the historical context in which s.6A came to be enacted, more particularly, that s.6A sought to achieve a delicate balance between two competing interests. [Paras 139, 140, 142, 143, 178, 208, 213, 215] Constitution of India – Art. 14 – Manifest arbitrariness vis-a-vis temporal unreasonableness – Explanation: Held: (per Pardiwala, J.) (Dissenting) Even if a statutory provision fulfils the two-pronged test of reasonable classification and rational nexus with the object of enactment, it can still suffer from the vice of manifest arbitrariness and be violative of Art.
