SOMANY CERAMICS LTD. 823 From the and dated 06.12.2019 of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh in CRM-M No. 52299 of 2019. Appearances: Wills Mathews, Karthik S. D., Paul John Edison, Dhanesh M. Nair, Manu Prakash Upadhyay, Ms. Shweta Garg, Advs. for the Appellant. Vipin Kumar Jai, Adv. for the Respondent. / OF THE SUPREME COURT C.T. RAVIKUMAR, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. This Appeal by accused No.4 in the complaint filed by the respondent herein under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short ‘the NI Act’) is directed against the dated 06.12.2019 in CRM-M No.52299 of 2019 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. As per the impugned the High Court declined to quash the complaint qua the appellant in exercise of the power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short ‘Cr. PC’). 3. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and learned counsel appearing for the respondent. 4. Virtually, the appellant set up twin grounds to seek quashment of the complaint against him; fi rstly, that he had resigned from the partnership fi rm on 28.05.2013 whereas the cheque in question was issued on 21.08.2015 and secondly, that the complaint is devoid of mandatory averments required to be made in terms of sub-Section 1 of Section 141 of the NI Act, as relates him. The High Court found that the contention in regard to the maintainability of the complaint against the appellant, owing to his retirement from the partnership fi rm prior to the issuance of the cheque in question, is a matter of evidence and ultimately, the appellant would have to lead evidence and prove that fact. Consequently, it was held that the complaint could not be rejected qua the appellant at the initial stage in exercise of the powers under Section 482 Cr.PC. 824 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that even if it is taken that the factum of his retirement from the partnership fi rm on 28.5.2013 was prior to the cheque in question on 21.8.2015 is a matter of evidence, the complaint as against the appellant is liable to be quashed owing to the absence of mandatory averments required to be made in terms of Section 141 (1) of the NI Act, in the complaint.
