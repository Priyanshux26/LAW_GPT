17. The Trial Court, after appreciating the evidence, found that the evidence of PW 1 and 2, eye-witnesses to the account, to have fully supported the prosecution story and during the cross-examination, the defence could not elicit anything which could discredit their testimony. 18. Coming back to the applicability of section 294 CrPC, reference may be had to the following s of this Court in the case of Sonu alias Amar vs. State of Haryana4 wherein this Court had held in para 30 as follows: “30. Section 294 of the Cr.P.C. 1973 provides a procedure for filing documents in a Court by the prosecution or the accused. The documents have to be included in a list and the other side shall be given an opportunity to admit or deny the genuineness of each document. In case the genuineness is not disputed, such document shall be read in evidence without formal proof in accordance with the Evidence Act.” 19. Further, in the case of Shamsher Singh Verma vs. State of Haryana,5 this Court held in para 14 as under: “14….. It is not necessary for the court to obtain admission or denial on a document under sub-section (1) to Section 294 CrPC personally from the accused or complainant or the witness. The endorsement of admission or denial made by the counsel for defence, on the document filed 4 [2017] 8 SCR 151 : (2017) 8 SCC 570 5 [2015] 12 SCR 234 : (2016) 15 SCC 485 1734 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports by the prosecution or on the application/ report with which same is filed, is sufficient compliance of Section 294 CrPC. Similarly on a document filed by the defence, endorsement of admission or denial by the public prosecutor is sufficient and defence will have to prove the document if not admitted by the prosecution. In case it is admitted, it need not be formally proved, and can be read in evidence. In a complaint case such an endorsement can be made by the counsel for the complainant in respect of document filed by the defence.” 20. Also, this Court in the case of Akhtar vs. State of Uttaranchal6 has held in para 21 as under: “21. It has been argued that non-examination of the concerned medical officers is fatal for the prosecution. However, there is no denial of the fact that the defence admitted the genuineness of the injury reports and the poot-mortem examination reports before the trial court. So the genuineness and authenticity of the documents stands proved and shall be treated as valid evidence under Section 294 of the CrPC. It is settled position of law that if the genuineness of any document filed by a party is not disputed by the opposite party it can be read as substantive evidence under sub-section (3) of Section 294 CrPC. Accordingly, the post-mortem report, if its genuineness is not disputed by the opposite party, the said post-mortem report can be read as substantive evidence to prove the correctness of its contents without the doctor concerned being examined.” 21.
