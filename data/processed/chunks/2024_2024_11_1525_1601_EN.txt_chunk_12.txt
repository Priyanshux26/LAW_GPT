antenna?” The Bombay High Court decided all the above questions of law against the Assessee and in favour of the Revenue. 9.13 In deciding the abovementioned issues, the Bombay High Court considered the following aspects: (i) That the aforesaid goods are not “capital goods” within the meaning under Rule 2(a)(A) of the CENVAT Rules, since these are immovable property. (ii) That these goods are not the components/accessories of antenna within the meaning of Rule 2(a)(A)(iii). (iii) That these goods are not “inputs” within the meaning of Rule 2(k). 1544 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports In considering the aforesaid aspects the Bombay High Court analysed the relevant provisions of CENVAT Rules, as to what amounts to “capital goods” and “input” and also the provisions of Rule 3 which provides for credit on excise duty paid in discharging liability towards service tax. 9.14 The Bombay High Court, after considering the definition clauses in the CENVAT Rules, took the view that the goods in question i.e. tower and parts thereof which are fastened and fixed to the earth after their erection become immovable properties and therefore, these cannot be goods and hence not “capital goods” within the meaning of the CENVAT Rules. The Bombay High Court also took the view that the tower and parts thereof in the CKD or SKD condition, would fall under Chapter Heading 7308 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, but the aforesaid heading is not specified either in clause (i) or clause (ii) of Rule 2(a)(A) of the CENVAT Rules to be treated as “capital goods”. The Bombay High Court further opined that since these are neither components, spares and accessories of goods falling under any of the Chapters or Headings of the Central Excise Tariff Schedule as specified in Rule 2(a)(A)(i), the goods in question would not be “capital goods” for the purpose of CENVAT credit. 9.15 The Bombay High Court also did not find favour with the contention of the Assessee that tower is an accessory of antenna since, without tower, antenna cannot be installed, and consequently, antenna cannot function and hence tower should be treated as part or component of antenna. 9.16 In coming to the above stated conclusions, the Bombay High Court considered various decisions, cited by both the contesting parties, some of which we will advert to briefly. 9.16.1 Before the Bombay High Court, the Assessee in support of the contention that the tower and parts thereof and PFBs are not immoveable properties, relied upon the following, inter alia, decisions: (i) CCE V.
