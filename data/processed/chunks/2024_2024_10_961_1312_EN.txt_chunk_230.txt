One of the contentions was that the provision was under-inclusive since it only dealt with a situation where a man had sexual intercourse with a married woman without the consent of the husband but not the other way around, that is a woman having sexual intercourse with a married man without the consent of his wife. The Constitution Bench tested the provision by applying a high standard of review. This Court held that there was no rational yardstick for the classification116 and that the yardstick was steeped in gender stereotypes where a woman is considered to not have any agency.117 In my concurring opinion, I noted that the problem with Section 497 was not just its ‘under inclusion’ but the impact of the under-inclusion of subjugating a woman to a position 114 “But it may have been found […] that the seed is dropped in such quantities as to cause special trouble. It may be that the neglected strips occupied by railroads afford a ground where noxious strips occupied by railroads afford a ground where noxious weeds flourish, and that whereas self-interest leads to the owners of farms to keep down pests, the railroad companies have done nothing in a matter which concerns their neighbors only.” 115 [2018] 11 SCR 765 : (2019) 3 SCC 39 116 See [2018] 11 SCR 765 : (2019) 3 SCC 39 [Chief Justice Misra, writing for himself and Justice Khanwilkar [23]] 117 [2018] 11 SCR 765 : (2019) 3 SCC 39 [Justice DY Chandrachud [35]] 1280 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of inferiority.118 A high standard of scrutiny was applied to test the validity of an under-inclusive provision. 67. In Basheer v. State of Kerala,119 the constitutional validity of the proviso to sub-Section (1) of Section 41 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Act 2001120 was under challenge. By the 2001 Amendment, the sentence for offences under the NDPS Act was altered. Section 41, included by the 2001 Amendment, provided that the amended provisions shall apply to all pending cases before the court as on 2 October 2001 and all cases under investigation. The proviso to the provision excluded cases pending in appeal. The exclusion of the category of cases in the proviso was challenged on the ground of under-inclusiveness. Justice B N Srikrishna, writing for the two-Judge Bench observed that the classification could not be held to be unreasonable due to ‘marginal over-inclusiveness or under-inclusiveness’.121 This principle flows from the established judicial position that Article 14 does not require classifications with ‘mathematical precision’.122 This observation does not lead to the conclusion that under-inclusive provisions must be met with judicial deference. In Basheer (supra), this Court observed that the guiding principle of the provision was the conclusion of the trial since the application of the amended provision to pending appeals would reopen concluded trials.123 In this case, the court determined the yardstick of classification based on the reading of the provision(s) and observed that the yardstick was reasonable. Based on the yardstick, it was concluded that there was no case for under-inclusion.
