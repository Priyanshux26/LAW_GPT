197. Be that as it may, a look at the Memorandum of Oral Gift dated 19.12.1978 executed by Ghousuddin Khan (defendant No.52) B shows that the said document purports to be a record of the oral gift (hiba) already made on 10.10.1978. This Memorandum of Oral Gift declares that the donor have also delivered possession of the gifted property to the donee. Interestingly, this Memorandum of Oral Gift does not contain a Schedule of property, but contains very strangely, the boundaries alone. It will be useful to extract the last part of this C Memorandum of Oral Gift dated 19.12.1978. It reads as follows:- “Today on 19th December 1978 I have confirmed the oral gift made on 10th October 1978 in favor of the Donee and executed this Memorandum of gift in presence of the following witnesses. Hence these few words are written by me as a D MEMORANDUM OF GIFT so that it may remain as an authority and used at time of need. Dated : 19th December 1978. Boundaries: E North: Nizampet village South: Bombay High way East: Hydernagar village, West: Survey No. 28land of Jeelani Begum. F Sd/-DonorGhouse Mohiuddin Khan. Sd/- witness Sd/- witness” 198. It is true that in the body of the Memorandum, the donor claims to be the owner in possession of the land measuring acres 60 in G Survey No.172 of Hydernagar. But Survey No.172 of Hydernagar has land of a total extent of acres 196.20. The claim of defendant No.52 to acres 60 out of the total extent, is on the basis of an purportedly passed first on 31.01.1976, in Application No.139 of 1971. But the only passed in this application is to the effect that the parties have not been able to agree upon the allotment of shares and that therefore, the H M/s TRINITY INFRAVENTURES LTD. & ORS. ETC. v. M. S. 367 MURTHY & ORS. ETC. [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] matter had to be forwarded to the Collector under Section 54 CPC. But A all of a sudden, a final report filed by one P. Narasimha Rao Receiver/ Commissioner, surfaces, allegedly on the basis of a compromise decree in ApplicationNo.185 of 1973. In the table contained in the said final report, Survey No.172 is shown to have been sub-divided into 25 different parts bearing Survey Nos.172/1 to 172/25. What is shown therein to B have been allotted to defendant No.52 were the following: Survey No. Allotted to D-52 Out of 172/8 0.2 G 9 Acres 39 Guntas 172/9 10.02 G 10 Acres 02 Guntas 172/17 7.08 G 7 Acres 08 Guntas C 172/18 10.00 G 10 Acres 00 Guntas 172/19 10.07 G 10 Acres 07 Guntas 172/20 9.34 G 9 Acres 34 Guntas 172/21 5.04 G 5 Acres 04 Guntas 172/22 5.38 G 5 Acres 38 Guntas 172/23 5.00 G 5 Acres 25 Guntas D 62.13 G 199. Interestingly, the passed in Application No.139 of 1971 is dated 21.01.1976. If pursuant to the said , Survey No.172 had been sub-divided and different parcels of land in various sub-divisions of Survey No.172 stood allotted to defendant No.52, the Memorandum of E Gift dated 19.12.1978 should have contained all these sub-divisions of survey numbers and a proper description.
