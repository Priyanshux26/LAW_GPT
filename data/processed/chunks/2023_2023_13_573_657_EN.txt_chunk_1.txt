It is this hiding of the fact and not specifying the details in their letter that led to the issuance of the show cause notice and invocation of Section 11A and Section 11 AC of the CE Act, by the Department. It cannot be ignored that till fi ling of the letter dated 30.03.2006, the assessee itself was classifying the product as ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ falling under CET SH 2403 9930 and being a large-scale manufacturer and paying large sums of amount as duty, to contend that it was unaware of the diff erence between these two products, or to contend that it had classifi ed the product as ‘zarda/ jarda scented tobacco’ by ignorance, is not a plausible justifi cation on part of the assessee. However, on the issuance of Notifi cation No.2 of 2006 dated 01.03.2006 under which ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was excluded or in other words not included in the said notifi cation, the assessee changed the description of its product from ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ to ‘chewing tobacco’. The date of communication of the letter dated 30.03.2006 by the assessee also acquires signifi cance in as much as the Notifi cation No.2 of 2006 dated 01.03.2006 were to take eff ect from 01.04.2006, just two days later. The intention was to evade payment of duty payable under Section 4 of CE Act; despite knowing the fact that its product was not covered under relevant notifi cation which provides for valuation under Section 4A, yet COMMR.

AND OTHERS the assessee did so, only to pay duty on lower value as per Section 4A of CE Act, by claiming the product manufactured by it as ‘chewing tobacco’ rather than ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ to avail benefi t of MRP-based assessment which was lower than the value as prescribed under Section 4 of the CE Act. The Adjudicating Authority was of the clear view that there has been a deliberate intention to avoid payment of duty by the assessee by misclassifi cation and willful misstatement of its product and hence it was justifi ed in invoking the extended period as provided in the proviso to Section 11A(1) of CE Act, 1944. [Paras 40, 41, 42 and 43] Central Excise Tax, 1944 – ss. 4 and 4A - Classifi cation – Two competing entries – ‘chewing tobacco’ and ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’- Product manufactured and cleared by the assessee for the period 01.03.2006 to 10.07.2006 to be classifi ed under the Central Excise Tariff Sub-Heading( CET SH) 2403 9910 as ‘chewing tobacco’ or under CET SH 2403 9930 as ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco.
