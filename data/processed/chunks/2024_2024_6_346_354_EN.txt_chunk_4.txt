The fact situation cannot be compared with harvesting of crops or plea to look after business affairs. In this background, once the matter is subjudice and the questions relating to legality of arrest are under consideration, a more holistic and libertarian view is justified, in the background that the 18th Lok Sabha General Elections are being held. 16. We will now refer to the s relied on behalf of the DoE: (i) In Anukul Chandra Pradhan v. Union of India and Others12, this Court rejected the constitutional challenge to sub-section (5) to Section 62 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, observing that the right to vote is not a constitutional right, and that the right can be curtailed. Interestingly, the proviso to the said sub-section states that a person subjected to preventive detention can vote. The prohibition was upheld on several grounds, including, inter alia, it promotes the object of free and fair elections. Indeed there are decisions of this Court that advert to the importance of elections in democracy, described as the barometer and lifeline of parliamentary system and its setup.13 (ii) In K. Ananda Nambiar and Another v. Chief Secretary to the Government of Madras and Others14, challenge to the Defence of India Rules, 1962 in its application to Members of Parliament, was rejected on the ground that members of the legislature cannot claim freedom from arrest. Detention does not violate privileges of the Members of Parliament. (iii) In State of Maharashtra v. Anand Chintaman Dighe15, this Court while allowing the appeal, observed that the High Court has misdirected itself in granting bail to an accused convicted 12 [1997] Supp. 1 SCR 641 : (1997) 6 SCC 1 13 See Anoop Baranwal v. Union of India (Election Commission Appointments), (2023) 6 SCC 161, quoting from S.R. Chaudhuri v. State of Punjab and Others (2001) 7 SCC 126 14 [1966] 2 SCR 406 : AIR 1966 SC 657 15 [1990] 1 SCR 73 : (1990) 1 SCC 397 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 353 Arvind Kejriwal v. Directorate of Enforcement under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987, by refusing to look into statements and further material collected by the investigating agency. 17. We would reject the argument that the reasoning recorded by us in paragraphs 7, 8 and 14, results in grant of privilege or special status to politicians. As observed in paragraphs 7, 8 and 14, several peculiarities of the case have weighed with us. In Siba Shankar Das @ Pintu v. State of Odisha and Another16, this Court accepting the appeal, deleted the condition imposed by the High Court stipulating that the appellant shall not be involved in any political activities, directly or indirectly. Imposition of this condition, the holds, would breach fundamental rights. No such condition should be imposed. A coordinate Bench of this Court in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Nara Chandra Babu Naidu17, in an appeal filed by the State, by an interim has deleted the condition restraining the respondent therein from organising or participating in public rallies and meetings, thereby permitting him to participate in the political process.
