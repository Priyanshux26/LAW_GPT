In paragraph 19 of India Cement, this Court considered Guruswamy & Co., vs. State of Mysore, AIR 1967 SC 1512, (“Guruswamy”) to indicate what a cess is. On analysing Sections 115 and 116 of the Madras legislation referred to above, this Court observed that the expression royalty in the Explanation could not be included in the definition of “land revenue” properly called or conventionally known, which is separate and distinct from royalty. 15.6 Reference was also made to the s of the Mysore High Court in M/s Laxminarayana Mining Co., Bangalore vs. Taluk Development Board, AIR 1972 Mys 299 (“Laxminarayana Mining Co.”) and Patna High Court in Laddu Mal vs. The State of Bihar, AIR 1965 Pat 491, (“Laddu Mal”) and the of this Court in HRS Murthy. It was observed that in the latter case attention of this Court was not invited to the provisions of MMDR Act, 1957 and Section 9 thereof and the Second Schedule to the said Act. Under the above provisions, there was a clear bar on the State legislature taxing royalty payable under Section 9 of the said Act so as to in effect amend the Second Schedule of the said Act. Therefore, it was held that tax on royalty can be a tax on land or called land revenue. Even if it is a tax, which falls within Entry 50 - List II it will be ultra vires the State legislative power in view of Section 9(3) read with Section 2 of MMDR Act, 1957, which is a Parliamentary law. In the above legislative background, this Court held that royalty was a tax or “land revenue” under the Explanation clause referred to above, which could not be the basis for levy of cess as, by that, cess on royalty payable would not be in consonance with what is stipulated under Section 9(3) of the MMDR Act, 1957 but would exceed the amount so stipulated which would not be within the legislative competence to levy in view of Section 2 of MMDR Act, 1957 read with Entry 50 - List I. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1787 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. 15.7 This Court further referred to the s of Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat and Orissa High Courts, which had held that royalty is not a tax, namely, Bherulal vs. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1956 Rajasthan 161, (“Bherulal”); Dr. Shanti Saroop vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1969 P & H 79, (“Dr. Shanti Saroop”); Saurashtra Cement and Chemical Industries Ltd. Ranavav vs. Union of India, AIR 1979 Guj 180 (“Saurashtra Cement and Chemical Industries”); and Laxmi Narayan Agarwalla vs. State of Orissa, AIR 1983 Ori 210, (“Laxmi Narayan Agarwalla”) but did not find it necessary to discuss the same in the view it was taking and having regard to there being no discussion of the constitutional provisions in the aforesaid cases. 15.8 The contention of the State of Tamil Nadu in India Cement was that the State has a right to tax minerals and that in Entry 50 - List II, there was no limitation to the taxing power of the State.
