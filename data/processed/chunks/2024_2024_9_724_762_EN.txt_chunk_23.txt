2 (Ravindra), No. 3 (Manohar), No. 4 (Hans Raj) and No. 5 (Vishnu) under Section 331 read with Section 34, IPC cannot be sustained. 50. In view of confirmation of the finding on custodial torture their conviction and consequential sentence under Section 330, 348 and 387 read with Section 34, IPC is to be confirmed. Since the 754 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports conviction under Section 330 covers Section 323, IPC no separate sentence for voluntary causing hurt is to be imposed. 51. In view of the conclusions and finding in respect of the offence under Section 304-Part II read with Section 34, IPC, and the consequential acquittal of the convicts concerned granting benefit of doubt the convicts under the other offences are also entitled to get benefit of doubt, as those offences have relation with the main crime. Consequently, conviction based on finding guilt under Section 201, 202, 203 and 218 read with Section 34, on appellants-convicts concerned are also liable to be set aside. 52. The above discussion and conclusion would inevitably invite interference with the conviction of the appellant-convicts under Section 201, IPC read with Section 34, IPC, on all other grounds than for causing disappearance of evidence by destroying the dead body of Shama @ Kalya mentioned in paragraph 112 of the impugned common of the High Court. 53. In the result, I dispose of all the appeals as under: - I. Crl. Appeal No.1614 of 2012 stands abated. II. Crl. Appeal Nos.1615, 1616, 1617 & 1618 of 2012 are partly allowed and the common dated 12.07.2011 of the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court stands set aside except to the extent whereunder appellants in Crl. Appeal No.1617 of 2012 viz., Ravindra (A2) and, Hans Raj (A4), appellant in Crl. Appeal No.1618 of 2012 viz., Manohar (A3) and, appellant in Crl. Appeal No. 1616 of 2012 viz., Vishnu (A5) are convicted under Sections 330, 348 and 387, IPC, and sentenced to undergo one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.1,000/- each and in default to suffer simple imprisonment for four months on each count. Accordingly, all the appellant-convicts are acquitted of all the other offences for which each of them was convicted and sentenced. In view of this further action is required only in respect of A2 to A5 viz., appellants in Crl. Appeal Nos. 1617 of 2012, 1618 of 2012 and, 1616 of 2012, that too in case any sentence remains unserved in view of confirmation of conviction and sentence under Sections 330, 348 and 387 read with Section 34, IPC. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 755 Manik & Ors. v. The State of Maharashtra Sanjay Kumar, J 1. Having perused the erudite authored by my learned brother, Justice C.T. Ravikumar, I find myself unable to subscribe to some of the views and conclusions noted therein. Hence, this differing opinion. 2. At the outset, though my learned brother has prefaced his verdict by stating that Criminal Appeal No. 1614 of 2012 filed by Manik, s/o Sitaram Jibhkate, stands abated as he died on 06.03.2022, I do not find anything on record to support and substantiate this statement.
