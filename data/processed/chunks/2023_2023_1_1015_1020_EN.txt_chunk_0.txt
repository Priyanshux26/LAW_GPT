Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned C and dated 13.12.2017 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in Writ Petition (C) No. 11476 of 2016 by which the High Court has allowed the said writ petition and has declared that the acquisition with respect to the land in question is deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter D referred to as “Act, 2013”), the Delhi Development Authority has preferred the present appeal. 3. We have heard Shri Nitin Mishra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant and Shri Gopal Sankaranarayan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the contesting respondent no.1 – original E writ petitioner at length. We have also gone through and considered the averments in the original writ petition as well as the impugned and passed by the High Court. 3.1 From the impugned and passed by the High Court it appears that though it was the specific case on behalf of the F Authority and so stated in the counter that the possession of the land in question was taken on 27.09.2012 and that the original writ petitioner was not the recorded owner and the land absolutely vested in the Gaon Sabha, thereafter the High Court has declared the acquisition with respect to the land in question as deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of G the Act, 2013 solely on the ground that the compensation has not been paid to the petitioner.
