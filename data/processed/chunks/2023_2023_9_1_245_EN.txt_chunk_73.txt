G 8. A right to elect, fundamental though it is to democracy, is, anomalously enough, neither a fundamental right nor a common law right. It is pure and simple, a statutory right. So is the right to 29AIR 1952 SC 64 H 301982 (1) SCC 691 ANOOP BARANWAL v. UNION OF INDIA 101 [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] be elected. So is the right to dispute an election. Outside of statute, A there is no right to elect, no right to be elected and no right to dispute an election.” (Emphasis supplied) 97. Mohan Lal Tripathi vs. District Magistrate, Raibraally and B others31 was a case wherein the appellant who was elected directly under Section 43 of the U.P. Municipalities Act was removed by a no- confidence motion. It was his contention that his removal was undemocratic as it was sought to be done by a smaller and different body than the one that elected him. It is in these facts that the court inter alia held as follows: C “..But electing representatives to govern is neither a ‘fundamental right’ nor a ‘common right’ but a special right created by the statutes or a ‘political right’ or ‘privilege’ and not a ‘natural[‘, absolute’ or ‘vested right’. This Court was not dealing with the impact of Article 326. It D followed the judgement in N.P. Ponnuswamy (supra). 98. In Rama Kant Pandey v. Union of India32, a Bench of three learned judges was dealing with a petition challenging the validity of the Representation of the People (Amendment Ordinance) Act, 1992 on the ground of violation of Articles 14, 19 and 21. Section 52 providing for E countermanding of polls was amended. It was in the context of the said challenge, the Court noted that the right to vote or to stand as a candidate for election was neither a fundamental nor civil right. It purported to follow the views which originated in Ponnuswamy case (supra). 99. In Anukul Chandra Pradhan, Advocate Supreme Court v. F Union of India and others33, a Bench of three learned Judges, while dealing with a challenge to Section 62(5) of the 1951 Act, on the ground that it violated Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution, upheld Section 62(5). We may only notice the following views expressed by the Court: “5. There are provisions made in the election law which exclude G persons with criminal background of the kind specified therein, from the election scene as candidates and voters. The object is to 31(1992) 4 SCC 80 32 (1993) 2 SCC 438 33 (1997) 6 SCC 1 H 102 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A prevent criminalisation of politics and maintain probity in elections. Any provision enacted with a view to promote this object must be welcomed and upheld as subserving the constitutional purpose. The elbow room available to the legislature in classification depends on the context and the object for enactment of the provision. The existing conditions in which the law has to be applied cannot be B ignored in adjudging its validity because it is relatable to the object sought to be achieved by the legislation.
