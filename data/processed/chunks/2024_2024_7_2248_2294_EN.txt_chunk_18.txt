arising out of SLP (C) No. 2753 of 2023, is mentioned at entry No. 8 dated 12.02.1999. There an extent of 1500 sq. ft. was sold for Rs.1,50,000/- which would be @ 100 per sq. ft. Ultimately in the of the Reference Court in LAC No. 183 of 2000 dated 15.01.2005, the Court considered the valuation offered by the valuer in that case of Rs.200/- per sq. ft.; sale instance of Rs.175/- per sq. ft. in one of the exemplars and after reducing the value of the land for fluctuations in the market value and the prevailing ambience had arrived at a figure of Rs.100/-. This coincidentally tallies with the sale instance mentioned in Exh. 45 therein. In that case, other statutory benefits were awarded. 54. Be that as it may, in law what is mandated is to examine the potentiality of the land. Indisputably, by a common award the appellant’s land and the land in Survey No. 7/2 in Akoli Bujurg were treated on par by the Land Acquisition Officer. Admittedly, the surrounding areas have lands for which non-agricultural permission had been given. It has also come in evidence that the land is in a locality surrounded by bustling commercial establishments and educational institutions and even the evidence of the acquiring body admits that the Tehsil’s office and Collector’s office in Akola District and Akola Taluk are located in the nearby area (evidence of DW-1). Photographs produced by PW-2 also show that there have been developments around the area. 55. The question here is whether in the present appeals the Reference Court was justified in following the award in LAC No. 183 of 2000. The High Court has held that the land fell in the blue zone which finding we have set aside. It further held that while the land of the appellant was on the bank of the river Morna, other Survey Nos., namely, Survey Nos. 5, 6 and 7 were above Survey No.1 and beyond the Gaothan of Akoli Bk. and away from the bank of river Morna. It also held that Survey No.7/2 was converted into non-agricultural use. It held that Survey No. 1 was never converted to non-agricultural land and hence Exh.71 sale deed of 10.05.1999 could not be relied upon. The High Court also relied on Exh.67 a letter dated 25.02.2000 wherein it is mentioned in para therein that Survey No. 1 (suit land) Survey No. 5/2, Survey Nos. 5/1, 7, 8 2, 25, 9/1-A of mauza Akoli fell in the no Development zone and therefore could not be converted 2272 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports into non-agricultural purpose though the said lands fell within the municipal town. This finding has been countered by the appellant by stating that in fact non-agricultural permission has been granted for Survey Nos.5/1, 7 8, 9/1-A and 28 in the written submissions. The same has not been converted by the respondent-authorities. 56. The surrounding land to the appellant’s land has already been converted and the appellant has been granted the Nazul sheet and necessary charges have also been paid.
