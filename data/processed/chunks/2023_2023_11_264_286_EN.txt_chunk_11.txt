v. A. Krishnappa (Dead) Through LRs.24 (three-Judge Bench). 21.6 Mere passing of an ejectment does not cause brake in possession neither causes his dispossession; In Balkrishna v. Satyaprakash24 (two-Judge Bench) this Court held : “…Mere passing of an of ejectment against a person claiming to be in adverse possession neither causes his dispossession nor discontinuation of his possession which alone breaks the continuity of possession.” 21.7 When the land subject of proceedings wherein adverse possession has been claimed, belongs to the Government,the Court 22 (2019) 9 SCC 369 23 (2014) 1 SCC 669 24 (2001) 2 SCC 498 280 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. is duty-bound to act with greater seriousness, eff ectiveness, care and circumspection as it may lead to Destruction of a right/title of the State to immovable property. In State of Rajasthan v. Harphool Singh25 (two-Judge Bench) it was held : “12. So far as the question of perfection of title by adverse possession and that too in respect of public property is concerned, the question requires to be considered more seriously and eff ectively for the reason that it ultimately involves destruction of right/title of the State to immovable property and conferring upon a third-party encroacher title where he had none.” Further, in Mandal Revenue Offi cer v. Goundla Venkaiah26 (two- Judge Bench)it was stated : “…It is our considered view that where an encroacher, illegal occupant or land grabber of public property raises a plea that he has perfected title by adverse possession, the court is duty-bound to act with greater seriousness, care and circumspection. Any laxity in this regard may result in destruction of right/title of the State to immovable property and give an upper hand to the encroachers, unauthorised occupants or land grabbers.” 21.8 A plea of adverse possession must be pleaded with proper particulars, such as, when the possession became adverse. The court is not to travel beyond pleading to give any relief, in other words, the plea must stand on its own two feet. This Court has held this in the case of V. Rajeshwari v. T.C. Saravanabava27 (two-Judge Bench) : “…A plea not properly raised in the pleadings or in issues at the stage of the trial, would not be permitted to be raised for the fi rst time at the stage of appeal…” It has also been held in the case of State of Uttrakhand v. Mandir Sri Laxman Sidh Maharaj28 (two-Judge Bench) : 25 (2000) 5 SCC 652 26 (2010) 2 SCC 461 27 (2004) 1 SCC 551 28 (2017) 9 SCC 579 GOVERNMENT OF KERALA & ANR. v. 281 JOSEPH AND OTHERS [SANJAY KAROL, J.] “…The courts below also should have seen that courts can grant only that relief which is claimed by the plaintiff in the plaint and such relief can be granted only on the pleadings but not beyond it. In other words, courts cannot travel beyond the pleadings for granting any relief…” Mandir Sri Laxman Sidh Maharaj (supra) was relied on in Dharampal (Dead) v. Punjab Wakf Board29 (two-Judge Bench) on the same principle.
