Neither party can rely upon its own mistake to say that it was a nullity from the beginning, no matter that it was a mistake which to his mind was fundamental, no matter that the other party knew that he was under a mistake.51 40. The in Vidya Drolia and Others v. Durga Trading Corporation52, after referring to Avitel Post Studioz Ltd. v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Ltd.53, draws a distinction between contract obtained through fraud, and post contract fraud or cheating. The latter falls outside the scope of Section 17 of the Contract Act. It observes that the fraud may permeate the entire contract and above all the agreement of arbitration, rendering it void. However, it may not be so when the allegations of fraud touch upon the internal aff airs of the parties inter se, having no implication in the public domain. 41. There are also two aspects of the in Vidya Drolia (supra), which need to be noticed. First, I agree to and accept the error made by me in the which observes that Section 11(6A) of the Arbitration Act has ceased to be operative in view of the enforcement of Section 3 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2019. As rightly observed by Hon’ble the Chief Justice, Section 3 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2019which relates to the amendment to Section 11 has not been enforced. Secondly, as has been noted in the of Hon’ble the Chief Justice and in Career Institute Educational Society v. Om Shree Thakurji Educational Society54, the issue before this Court in Vidya Drolia (supra)was not the validity of an unstamped or under-stamped arbitration agreement. No specifi c opinion was expressed on this question. 51 See ITC Ltd.v. George Joseph Fernandes and Another(1989) 2 SCC 1, which quotes from Smith v. Hughes LR (1871) 6 QB 597 and Sollev. Butcher (1950) 1 KB 671. The in ITC Ltd.(supra) was under the Arbitration Act,1940 and should not be applied to interpret the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. 52 (2021) 2 SCC 1. 53 (2021) 4 SCC 713. 54 2023 SCC OnLine SC 586. 121 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. The reference to the validity of an unstamped arbitration agreement, as mentioned in Garware Wall Ropes Ltd. v. Coastal Marine Constructions & Engg. Ltd.55, was only to serve the purpose of drawing a comparison between the ‘existence’ and the ‘validity’ of an arbitration agreement, and not a comment or opinion on the ‘existence’ of unstamped or under-stamped arbitration agreements. 42. For the reasons set out in detail by Hon’ble the Chief Justice and recorded herein, I agree with the conclusions drawn, and referred to above. I also concur with the other fi ndings and ratio in the by Hon’ble the Chief Justice. Headnotes prepared by: Matters to be placed before appropriate Bench. Bibhuti Bhushan Bose 55 (2019) 9 SCC 209.
