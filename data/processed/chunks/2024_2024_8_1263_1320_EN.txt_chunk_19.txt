IBBI/2020- 21/GN/REG059 dated 20.04.2020 1290 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “Exclusion of period of lockdown 47A. Subject to the provisions of the Code, the period of lockdown imposed by the Central Government in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak shall not be counted for the purposes of computation of the time-line for any task that could not be completed due to such lockdown, in relation to any liquidation process.” 32.6 It is evident from a perusal of Regulation 47A, that the benefit of the said regulation was made available not only for initiation of any litigation, but also for computation of the timeline for completing any task in connection with a liquidation process that could not be completed on account of declaration of the lockdown. We are not inclined to accept the submission made on behalf of the appellant that the word ‘Litigants’ used in the dated 23rd March, 2020 passed in the Suo Moto Writ Petition ought to be given a narrow interpretation so as to exclude a party like the Auction Purchaser herein as stricto sensu, it was not a litigant who was required to file any petition/ application/suit/appeal or other proceeding before any Court/ Tribunal/Authority within the period of limitation prescribed under a general law of limitation or under the special laws. It must be emphasised that a can neither be read like a Statute nor can the expressions used in a be assigned a narrow meaning or curtailed. In the larger contextual background of the Covid-19 breakout, a liberal interpretation would have to be adopted and the Auction Purchaser would be entitled to the benefit of the dated 23rd March, 2020 read with Regulation 47A of the IBBI Regulations, 2016. The appellant cannot be heard to state that when the entire country was engulfed by the Covid-19 pandemic and a countrywide lockdown was imposed on 25th March, 2020 that was extended from time to time, the Auction Purchaser ought to have deposited the balance sale consideration within the stipulated 90 days. In such a situation, a lenient view would have to be taken by the Court. 32.7 The factual matrix of the case also needs to be kept in mind. The Covid-19 pandemic had broken out in the month of March, 2020. A curfew was clamped by the Central Government on 22nd March, 2020, restricting the movement of the public. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1291 V.S. Palanivel v. P. Sriram, CS, Liquidator, Etc. The Adjudicating Authority had issued a notification that only urgent matters would be taken up between 16th March, 2020 and 27th March, 2020. Before completion of the aforesaid period, the Central Government had declared a nationwide lockdown for 21 days till 14th April, 2020, which period was subsequently extended till 03rd May, 2020. In this backdrop, came the of this Court on 23rd March, 2020 extending the period of limitation w.e.f. 15th March, 2020 till further s, which was extended from time to time. The Governing Board of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India also decided on 17th April, 2020 to amend the IBBI Regulations, 2016 due to nationwide lockdown and incorporated Regulation 47A.
