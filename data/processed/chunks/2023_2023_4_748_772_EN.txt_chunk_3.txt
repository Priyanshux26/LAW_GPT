[Paras 21, 22][768-C- H; 769-A-B] H 752 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 1.5. There was limited material regarding the mitigating circumstances of the appellants; existing jail reports and probation officer reports, were also outdated. So, this court directed the preparation and submission of three reports, to facilitate fairer consideration of the question of sentence. These were: a report of the probation officer, report on nature of work done while in B jail (by the jail administration), and a psychological and psychiatric evaluation report (by Director of VIMHANS); these are on record, and form part of this court’s consideration, to ascertain the individualised sentences appropriate in the present case. The Counsel placed on record, written submissions outlining the C mitigating factors and justification for a modification, on the question of sentence. [Para 24][769-E-F; 770-A-B] 1.6. The sole motive for this crime seems to have been greed. Undoubtedly, there was premeditation in the commission of the crime. These are the aggravating circumstances. [Para D 27][771-D-E] 1.7. Both the appellants in the instant case, share some commonalities: they were of young age at the time of offence, hail from educated backgrounds, and they continue to enjoy the love and affection of their families, each of which have a good E standing and strong ties within the communities they live in. While the material relating to their lives and social conditions pre-conviction do not offer an explanation as to the cause for commission of offence, it can certainly be said that the material available regarding their conduct post-conviction, remains encouraging. They have applied themselves during the time of F incarceration and used their time to contribute meaningfull-for which they have each received commendations. Their psychological and psychiatric evaluations were concluded to be normal, without cause for concern. A strong case is made out in support of the appellants’ probability of reform (as already G evidenced by their jail conduct), and reintegration into society. The State, too, has not indicated any material to the contrary, regarding this aspect. [Para 28][771-E-H] 1.8. In view of the totality of the facts and circumstances, it would be appropriate to modify the sentence awarded to both H VIKAS CHAUDHARY v. THE STATE OF DELHI 753 appellants to a minimum term of 20 years actual imprisonment. A [Para 29][771-H; 772-A] Amit v. State of Maharashtra (2003) 8 SCC 93 : [2003] Supp. 2 SCR 285; Laxman Naskar v.
