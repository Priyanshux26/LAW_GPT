Be that as it may, thereafter, the High Court dealt with the questions raised by the State as regards the alleged breach of principles of natural justice in point (B) and rejected all such contentions with reference to the record of proceedings as also E the pleadings and evidence of the parties. However, the High Court proceeded to disapprove the award in relation to the claims covered by the aforementioned points (C), (D), (E) and (F). Of course, on point (G), in relation to the award of interest for the pre-reference period and the period during which proceedings were pending before Arbitrator, the High Court found no reason to interfere but then, with reference to the F decision of this Court in Vedanta Ltd. v. Shenzhen Shandong Nuclear Power Construction Co. Ltd: (2019) 11 SCC 465, considered it appropriate to reduce the rate of interest to 10% from 15% p.a. In point (H), the High Court found no fault in the computations attached to the award as Schedules 2 and 3 but, in point (I) observed that the Commercial G Court only summarised the submissions of the parties and made a brief reference to the award without independent application of mind to the contentions raised. This, according to the High Court, had not been a satisfactory way of disposing of an application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996. H 400 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 7.3. The High Court concluded on the matter with the following observations and directions: - “195. For all the aforesaid reasons, we partly allow this appeal and set aside both the impugned and as well as the impugned award on the issues of variable charges (Rs. 24.66 B crores approx), downrating (Rs. 18.53 crores approx. ), variable charges on 4MW power (Rs. 3.94 crores approx. ), and netting out (Rs. 2.36 crores approx.). We reduce the interest rate from 15% to 10% per annum, payable from the date of Award till the date of payment of the determined amount. The rest of the impugned Award is however not interfered with. C 196. Since we have rejected the challenge to the summary of computations in Schedule 2 of the impugned Award, even after holding the issues of downrating, 4 MW power, fuel formula, facilitation fuel charges, and netting out in favour of the Appellant, the Appellant is still due and payable principal amount of Rs. 70.58 D crores together with interest component with which we have not interfered with. This amount comes to Rs. 151.97 crores as of 31.10.2017. On this amount of Rs. 151.97 crores, the Appellant will have to pay interest at the approved rate for the period from 31.10.2017 till the date of the Award i.e. 16.2.2018. Thereafter, E however, the Appellant will have to pay interest at the rate of 10% per annum from the date of Award till the payment of the amount to the Respondent. 197. The Appellant had already deposited an amount of Rs. 25 crores before the Commercial Court as a condition for a stay on the execution of the impugned Award.
