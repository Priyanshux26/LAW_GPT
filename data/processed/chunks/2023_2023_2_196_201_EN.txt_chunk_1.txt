have preferred the F present appeal. 2. Having heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties and having gone through the impugned and passed by the High Court it can be seen that by the impugned and the High Court has declared that the acquisition G with respect to the land in question is deemed to have lapsed on the ground that neither the possession of the land in question was taken nor the compensation has been tendered/paid and relying upon the earlier decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. Vs. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki and Ors., (2014) 3 SCC 183, and decision of the High Court in the case of Gyanender Singh & H 198 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors decided on 23.09.2014 in W.P. (C) No. 1393/2014. 3. However, it is required to be noted that before the High Court it was the specific case on behalf of the appellant(s) and so recorded by the High Court in paragraph 4 of the impugned and that B the physical possession could not be taken because of the operation of stay passed in writ petitions in which the stay was continuing. The High Court has also observed that “it is an admitted position that the stay continued to operate till 01.01.2014 when the 2013 Act came into effect.” In the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and Ors., (2020) 8 SCC 129, the Constitution Bench of C this Court has observed in paragraph 366 as under:- “366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under: 366.1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on 1-1-2014, the date of commencement of D the 2013 Act, there is no lapse of proceedings. Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of the 2013 Act. 366.2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding the period covered by an interim of the court, then proceedings shall continue as E provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the 2013 Act under the 1894 Act as if it has not been repealed. 366.3. The word “or” used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be read as “nor” or as “and”. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under Section F 24(2) of the 2013 Act takes place where due to inaction of authorities for five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the possession of land has not been taken nor compensation has been paid. In other words, in case possession has been taken, compensation has not been paid then there is no G lapse. Similarly, if compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no lapse. 366.4. The expression “paid” in the main part of Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not include a deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is provided in the proviso H to Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to LAND ACQUISITION COLLECTOR & ANR.
