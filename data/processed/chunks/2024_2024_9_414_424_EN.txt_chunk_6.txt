Later, he sought a month’s time to vacate [2024] 9 S.C.R. 423 M/s Sitaram Enterprises v. Prithviraj Vardichand Jain the suit premises. In our view, after dismissal of the Special Leave Petitions, Review Petitions and applications for extension of time to vacate the suit premises, said prayer is wholly unreasonable and a deliberate attempt to not to comply the directions issued by this Court to which he furnished an undertaking at a later stage. It is to observe that on dismissal of Special Leave Petitions on 6.6.2023 and lapse of nine months’ time on 6.3.2024, possession of the suit premises has not been delivered to the petitioner landlord complying the of this Court. From the date of expiry of time to hand over the possession i.e., 6.3.2024, six months’ further period has elapsed, even then compliance is not reported till today. 15. Considering all the facts and attending circumstances narrated above, we are of the view that it is a case in which the contemnor has deliberately and willfully not complied the of this Court dated 6.6.2023 and flouted the same. Therefore, we are constrained to hold him guilty for non-compliance of the directions of this Court. We also find no substance in the explanation furnished by him, as discussed above. 16. Upon holding the contemnor guilty of the contempt of of this Court, we had granted an opportunity to him before we pass any on sentence. Again the contemnor submits that being old aged person, having many illness and to support a large family, he may be granted pardon and be allowed a week time to vacate the suit premises. 17. From the discussion made hereinabove, we were reluctant to grant further time to vacate the suit premises, but in the interest of justice, we grant a week’s time to hand over the vacant and peaceful possession of the suit premises to the petitioner-landlord, otherwise, we direct that the passed by this Court on 6.6.2023 shall be complied with taking forceful possession from him. 18. Accordingly, we dispose-of these petitions with following directions – 18.1 The respondent/contemnor shall hand over vacant possession of both the properties to M/s Sitaram Enterprises as undertaken in furtherance to the dated 06.06.2023 passed by this Court in SLP(C) Nos. 12081-12082/2023 (Diary No.41124/2022) and SLP(C) Nos. 12083-12084/2023 (Diary No.41118/2022) within a period of seven days. 424 [2024] 9 S.C.R.
