Since respondent No.1 through the impugned notification has disentitled the OCI Cardholders from the process of admission to the seats to which the Indian citizens are entitled to participate in the selection process, they F have approached this court assailing the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021, in these petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. 5. The petitioners have accordingly sought for issue of an appropriate writ to quash clause 4(ii), its proviso and Explanation (1) as G contained in the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 bearing F No.2611/CC/05/2018-OCI. 6. The respondent No.1 has filed its objection statement seeking to justify the notification. It is necessary to take note herein that though in the instant batch of the petitions, the validity of the provisions in the H ANUSHKA RENGUNTHWAR & ORS. v. UNION OF INDIA & 255 ORS. Citizenship Act has not been assailed, in an another petition bearing A W.P. (C) No.1397 of 2020 since there is a challenge to the said provisions and was earlier tagged with these petitions, the respondents in the common counter affidavit have also referred to the provisions of the Act and the Constitution of India in to justify its validity. Since those aspects do not require consideration in this batch of cases, the objections by B respondent No.1 insofar as seeking to justify the issue of the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 alone is taken note. In that regard, it is contended that as per the notification dated 11.04.2005, the OCI Cardholders were given parity with NRIs in the educational field. Under the notification dated 05.01.2009, the OCI Cardholder students were entitled to appear for All India Pre Medical Test and such other tests to C make them eligible for admission. It is averred that a harmonious reading of 2005 and 2009 notifications leads to the conclusion that the OCI Cardholder students have parity to the NRIs and therefore can lay claim only to NRI quota seats. The educational right of OCI Cardholder students were discussed in a meeting of the Committee of Secretaries held on D 19.07.2018 wherein it was agreed that the OCI Cardholders may be treated at par with NRI, in the quota of NRI and they ought not to be eligible against seats meant for Indian citizens. Hence, it was felt that relevant notifications be issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs. In that view, the consolidated notification dated 04.03.2021 was issued in exercise of the power under Section 7B(1) of Act, 1955 whereby the earlier E notifications of 2005, 2007 and 2009 were incorporated so as to bring clarity with regard to the various provisions. It is contended that the rationale is to protect the rights of the Indian Citizens and in such matters, State may give preference to its citizens vis-à-vis foreigners holding OCI Cards. In that regard it is stated that the number of seats available F for medical and engineering courses in India are very limited and does not fully cater to the requirement of the Indian citizens.
