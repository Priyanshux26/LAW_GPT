However, only in a case where two views are possible and the Assessing Officer has adopted one view, such a decision, which might be plausible and it has resulted in loss of Revenue, such an is not revisable under Section 263 [Para 7.2][320-A-C] D 3. Having gone through the assessment as well as the passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax, we are also of the opinion that the assessment was not only erroneous but prejudicial to the interest of the Revenue also. In the facts and circumstances of the case, it cannot be said that the Commissioner exercised the jurisdiction under Section 263 not E vested in it. [Para 7.3][320-D-E] Malabar Industrial Co. Ltd.
