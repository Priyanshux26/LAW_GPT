The common question which arises for consideration in this batch of Civil Appeals is: whether the appellants – assessees are liable to pay tax under the Interest-Tax Act, 19741 on the interest component included in the hire-purchase instalments paid under the hire- purchase agreement? C 3. The facts, in brief, are that the appellants – assessees are non- banking finance and leasing companies registered with the Reserve Bank of India. Some of the appellants – assessees have been reclassified as hire-purchase finance companies. It is not disputed that the appellants – assessees are credit institutions within the meaning of Section 2(5-A) of D the Act, which reads as follows: “(5-A) “credit institution” means,— (i) a banking company to which the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949), applies (including any bank or banking institution referred to in Section 51 of that Act); E (ii) a public financial institution as defined in Section 4- A of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956); (iii) a State financial corporation established under Section 3 or Section 3-A or an institution notified under Section 46 of the State F Financial Corporations Act, 1951 (63 of 1951), and (iv) any other financial company;” It is also imperative to mention Section 2(5-B) of the Act, which defines a “financial company” and includes within its ambit hire-purchase G finance companies: “(5-B) “financial company” means a company, other than a company referred to in sub-clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of clause (5-A), being— 1For short, ‘the Act’.

A (i) a hire-purchase finance company, that is to say, a company which carries on, as its principal business, hire-purchase transactions or the financing of such transactions; xx xx xx” B 4. The contention of the appellants – assessees is that under a hire- purchase agreement, they hire out a vehicle to the customer and receive hire-purchase instalments, and not interest on loans and advances. As per the findings of fact recorded by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal2, the hirer has acknowledged that the appellants– assessees are the owners of the vehicle.
