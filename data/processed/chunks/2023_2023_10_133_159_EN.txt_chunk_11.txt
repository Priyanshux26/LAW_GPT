The total limit of import of 1.4 MMTPA was based on the total production capacity as on 09.10.2018 which had been fixed by the court on the basis of the capacity disclosed by the calciners themselves. 15. It is argued on behalf of Sanvira and the GOI, which are in E appeal, by special leave that the impugned is in error and that the of the single judge is correct. It is argued that there was a change of criteria adopted in the Public Notice dated 17.04.2020 issued by the GOI. Contrary to the earlier requirement of certification of production capacity by the Unit, the Public Notice dated 17.04.2020, required certification by the SPCB. In this case, the APPCB certified F Sanvira’s production capacity as on 09.10.2018 to be 3,30,000 MT and that figure was correctly considered while making allocation of RPC in its favour. 16. It was urged that in the absence of any challenge to the Public Notice dated 17.04.2020 or the certificate issued by the APPCB G regarding Sanvira’s production capacity (as 3,30,000 MT as on 09.10.2018), the challenge by Rain CII was untenable and was liable to be rejected. It is argued that the s dated 28.01.2019 and 08.07.2019 of thiscourt merely clarified that the overall import of RPC has to be confined to 1.4 MMTPA. This court did not consider Sanvira’s claim H that as on 09.10.2018 its production capacity was in fact, 3.30 lakh MT. M/S. SANVIRA INDUSTRIES v. RAIN CII CARBON (VIZAG) 149 LTD. & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 17. In reply Rain CII argued that the Committee had from the A very beginning rejected requests for enhancement of allocation on the ground that any capacity increase after 09.10.2018 would not be taken into consideration. This consistent stand was reflected in the EPCA’s minutes of the meeting prior to 03.06.2020. In fact, even the GOI defended the rejection of Sanvira’s request, barely five weeks before B the impugned allocation by contending before the High Court that Sanvira was abusing the judicial process by repeatedly requesting the same relief. Having regard to these facts, there is no change of circumstances - much less new development or new facts which could have persuaded the committee as held by the Single Judge. There was in fact no change in the criteria. On behalf of Rain CII, it was highlighted that all facts C pertaining to the alleged increase in capacity prior to 09.10.2018 i.e. the issuance of the CTO, the fact that inspection had been conducted by Sanvira’s creditors i.e. State Bank of India on 28.09.2018, were all mentioned in the previous requests for enhancement and even in the two applications filed before this Court. Having regard to all these D circumstances, the issuance of the certificate or letter by the APPCB almost two years after 09.10.2018, certifying that the second phase of Sanvira’s expansion had increased its capacity by 1,30,000 MT, was not any new development. In these circumstances the view expressed by the Division Bench in the impugned was reasonable.
