[2024] 11 S.C.R. 2329 : 2024 INSC 868 Ramachandra Reddy (Dead) Thr. LRs. & Ors. v. Ramulu Ammal (Dead) Thr. LRs. (Civil Appeal No. 3034 of 2012) 14 November 2024 [C.T Ravikumar and Sanjay Karol,* JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the deed executed, which gave rise to the present property dispute, was a gift deed or a deed of settlement; Whether the High Court was justified in reversing the concurrent findings of fact while exercising jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. Headnotes† Transfer of Property Act, 1882 – Section 122 – Indian Stamp Act, 1899 – Section 2(24) Determination of whether an instrument is Gift Deed or Deed of Settlement – Held, the instrument in the case is Deed of Settlement – The consideration need not always be in monetary terms and can be in other forms as well – Non-monetary consideration accepted for Deed of Settlement: Held: The High Court, while considering Second Appeal of the Respondents, reversed the concurrent findings of the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court that the deed executed in relation to the property in favour of one Govindammal was settlement deed – The High Court found that the deed in question was a gift deed and not one of settlement as the element of ‘adequate consideration’ was missing and instead, the transfer was effected out of love and affection for Govindammal – Held, the transfer of property in favour of Govindammal was in recognition of the fact that she had been taking care of the transferors and would continue to do so while also using the same to carry out charitable work – The High Court has erred in taking a constricted view of ‘consideration’, especially taking note of the fact that the settlement was between the members of a family – As such, Govindammal (now her heirs) is indeed entitled to 2/3rd share in the property, in terms of the settlement deed.

Supreme Court Reports Civil Procedure Code, 1908 – Section 100 – Power to interfere in Second Appeal limited: Held: The jurisdiction to interfere in findings where the Courts below have been ad idem, is limited and such limitation is well expounded – Referring to Gurdev Kaur v. Kaki (2007) 1 SCC 546 there is no jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal on the ground of an erroneous finding of fact, however gross or inexcusable the error may seem to be, and they added a note of warning that no court in India has power to add to, or enlarge, the grounds specified in Section 100 – Further reference made to V. Ramachandra Ayyar v. Ramalingam Chettiar, 1962 SCC OnLine SC 155 & Nazir Mohammed v. J. Kamala (2020) 19 SCC 57 on the limitations of the High Court while exercising jurisdiction under Section 100 of the CPC.
