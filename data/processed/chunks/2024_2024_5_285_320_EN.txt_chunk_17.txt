The surveyors were asked to have the workings on the above lines. Response of the Surveyors:- 55. In response, on 07.12.2022, the surveyors wrote to the NIACL stating that in spite of several reminders the Insured as on date had not submitted any clarification/details and as such the matter had remained pending. As requested by the NIACL, an alternative assessment by considering maximum depreciation was submitted with the recommendation of 60% depreciation fixing loss at Rs.7.90 Crores. 56. It was explained that in the report of 11.12.2001, the depreciation was adjusted to 32% considering the average life of the mill as 25 years. 310 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports That is 32% on overall for a period of usage of eight years at 4% per year. Eight years were arrived at since the mill was installed in 1989 and the fire was happened in 1999. The balance life of mill was taken as 17 years. In the letter it was clarified that as the machine was running at its optimum capacity, it was their opinion that the residual life as per the calculations should be 40% thereby implying applicable depreciation of 60% and that when 60% depreciation is considered the sum insured is deemed to be adequate. The residual life was taken as less than 10 years. On 03.01.2003, the NIACL addressed a letter to Insured stating that the loss amount as sanctioned would be Rs. 7.88 crores and since Rs. 5 crores (after deducting TDS) has already been paid, the balance amount would be Rs. 2.88 crores. Answers to Question No. (ii): a) Adoption of the Depreciation Method 57. From what has been discussed above, it emerges clearly that under the main terms of the policy the company was to pay the Insured the value of the property at the time of happening of the destruction (except where NIACL opts to reinstate). There was a special memorandum attached to the policy. That memorandum was the Reinstatement Value Clause which substituted the basis upon which the amount was payable from the value on the date of destruction to the cost of replacing or reinstating the property i.e. property of the same kind or type but not superior or more extensive than the insured property when new. However, as it transpires the said memorandum ceased to have any force since the Insured was unable and unwilling to replace or reinstate the property. Special Provision 4 (b) of the memorandum applied and rendered the Reinstatement Value Clause ineffective. 58. It is also amply clear that once we revert back to the original policy with its conditions, the Insured under Clause 6(b) of the conditions had an obligation to give NIACL all such further particulars, plans, specifications, books, vouchers and invoices with respect to the claim. It is also set out that no claim under the policy was to be payable unless the terms of these conditions were duly complied with. It is sufficiently brought out that in spite of the surveyors writing to the Insured repeatedly (on 14.12.1998, 03.05.2002, 24.06.2002 and 07.08.2002), there was no information forthcoming from the Insured about the invoices as proof of the value of the damaged equipment [2024] 5 S.C.R.
