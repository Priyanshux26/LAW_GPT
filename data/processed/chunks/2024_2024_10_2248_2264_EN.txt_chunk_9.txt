If different cheques which are subsequently dishonoured on presentation, are issued by the borrowing company acting through the appellant, the same could be said to be arising out of a single loan transaction so as to justify a direction for concurrent running of the sentences awarded in relation to dishonour of cheques relevant to each such transaction. That being so, the substantive sentence awarded to the appellant in each case relevant to the transactions with each company referred to above ought to run concurrently. We, however, see no reason to extend that concession to transactions in which the borrowing company is different no matter the appellant before us is the promoter/Director of the said other companies also. Similarly, we see no reason to direct running of the sentence concurrently in the case filed by State Bank of Patiala against M/s Sabhyata Plastics and 2262 [2025] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports M/s Rahul Plastics which transaction is also independent of any loan or financial assistance between the State Financial Corporation and the borrowing companies. We make it clear that the direction regarding concurrent running of sentence shall be limited to the substantive sentence only. The sentence which the appellant has been directed to undergo in default of payment of fine/ compensation shall not be affected by this direction. We do so because the provisions of Section 427 CrPC do not, in our opinion, permit a direction for the concurrent running of the substantive sentences with sentences awarded in default of payment of fine/compensation.’ (emphasis supplied) III. O M Cherian v State of Kerala (2015) 2 SCC 501 [3-Judge Bench] ‘18. While referring the matter to a larger Bench, the Bench observed that in Mohd. Akhtar Hussain case [Mohd. Akhtar Hussain v. Collector of Customs, (1988) 4 SCC 183: 1988 SCC (Cri) 921], Section 31 CrPC was not noticed by this Court. It is to be pointed out that in Mohd. Akhtar Hussain case [Mohd. Akhtar Hussain v. Collector of Customs, (1988) 4 SCC 183: 1988 SCC (Cri) 921] and Manoj case [(2014) 2 SCC 153: (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 763], the appellants who were convicted for different counts of offences arose out of a single transaction, favouring the exercise of discretion to the benefit of the accused that the sentences shall run concurrently. Those decisions are not cases arising out of conviction at one trial of two or more offences and therefore, reference to Section 31 CrPC in those cases was not necessitated. 19. As pointed out earlier, Section 31 CrPC deals with quantum of punishment which may be legally passed when there is (a) one trial; and (b) the accused is convicted of two or more offences. The ambit of Section 31 is wide, covering not only a single transaction constituting two or more offences but also offences arising out of two or [2025] 4 S.C.R. 2263 State (NCT) of Delhi v. Rajeev Sharma more transactions. In the two s in Mohd. Akhtar Hussain [Mohd. Akhtar Hussain v. Collector of Customs, (1988) 4 SCC 183: 1988 SCC (Cri) 921] and Manoj [(2014) 2 SCC 153: (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 763], the issue that fell for consideration was the imposition of sentence for two or more offences arising out of the single transaction.
