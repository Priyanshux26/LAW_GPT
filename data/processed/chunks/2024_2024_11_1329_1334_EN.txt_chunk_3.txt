8. Further, Mr. Rajat Sangwan, would also submit that the language of Section 14 is mandatory and on the basis of the said provision it cannot be said that the appellant has exercised due diligence in approaching the Court by filing the Section 34 petition. He also argued that strict enforcement of time-lines under the Arbitration Act are recognized and incorporated under the National Highways Act. For this purpose, he referred to sub-section 7 of Section 3(G) of the NH Act. 9. Having considered the matter in detail, we are of the opinion that the issue is covered by the decision of this court in Consolidated Engg. Enterprises v. Principal Secretary, Irrigation Dept.5 (supra). 10. We may hasten to add that when the substantive remedies under Sections 34 and/or 37 of the Arbitration Act are by their very nature 5 [2008] 5 SCR 1108 : 2008 (7) SCC 169. 1334 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports limited in their scope due to statutory prescription,6 it is necessary to interpret the limitation provisions liberally, or else, even that limited window to challenge an arbitral award will be lost. The remedies under Sections 34 and 37 are precious. Courts of law will keep in mind the need to secure and protect such a remedy while calculating the period of limitation for invoking these jurisdictions. 11. Applying Section 14 of the Limitation Act, we hold that there is sufficient cause for excluding the period commencing from 20.10.2011 to 23.02.2012. In view of the fact that this period is excluded, the appellant will be entitled to the statutory remedy under Section 34 of the Act. 12. In view of the above, we allow the appeals, set aside the and passed by the High Court in FAO Nos. 800/2013(O&M), 2000/2015(O&M), 1278/2015(O&M), 1290/2015(O&M), 7453/2014(O&M), 7454/2014(O&M), 2887/2015(O&M) and 8136/2014 (O&M) dated 19.10.2019 and also the of the District Judge, Jalandhar dated 16.05.2012 and restore the Section 34 petition in Arbitration No.3435/2012 to its original number. We further direct the District Judge, Jalandhar to issue notice to all the parties, hear them and decide the petition as per law. 13. With the above observations, the civil appeals are disposed of. 14. There shall be no as to costs. Result of the case: Appeals disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan 6 Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
