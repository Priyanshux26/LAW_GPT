It must be noted that the Banwasi only grants a right to be heard by a competent authority, and if such authority rejects a claim, then the said claim cannot exist against the situate land. [Para 21][1007-B-C] D 1.3 This right to be heard, must be granted to all claiming possession of the subject land, and the substantial right of possession can be granted or denied during the said hearing, by the competent authority, that is to say, the right to be heard must be enjoyed by all, and the right to possess, must be enjoyed by E those who have a legitimate claim. Further, the right to enjoy possession of any land notified under Section 4 of the Forest Act is not only limited to Adivasi communities and other forest dwelling communities, but is also based on proof of residence, date of original possession, etc. If the right to inhabit the said lands is not restricted only to certain communities, how can F the right to be heard on such claims be restricted to the same. [Paras 22 and 23][1007-C-E] 1.4 The appellants before the impugned passed by the High Court in Writ Jurisdiction, had two concurrent findings in their favour by way of decisions rendered by the lower courts. G The appellants had proved their possession over the subject land by leading evidence, and the veracity of the same, by way of proper procedure, was tested by both the lower courts. The High Court, however, without evidence being led by the respondents, set aside the concurrent findings. [Para 25][1007-G-H] H HARI PRAKASH SHUKLA & ORS. v. THE STATE OF UTTAR 1003 PRADESH & ANR. 1.5 The concurrent findings of the lower courts are neither A perverse, nor the said courts have over stepped their jurisdiction. In such a scenario, wherein neither of the conditions were satisfied, the High Court could not have re-appreciated the evidence in writ jurisdiction and come to a different conclusion. [Para 29][1008-E] B 1.6 The remedy granted under the Banwasi Sewa is available to the appellants, and the reappreciation of evidence done by the High Court while exercising its inherent powers under Article 226, is bad in law and is liable to be struck down. [Para 32][1009-B] C 1.7 Since the dispute has been held in favour of the appellants, the contempt petitions are rendered infructuous. The impugned and passed by the High Court is not liable to be sustained and is set aside. The s passed by the Forest Settlement Officer and Additional District Judge are D confirmed.
