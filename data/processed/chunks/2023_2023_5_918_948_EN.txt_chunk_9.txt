B On 14.5.2020, the applicants were produced before the learned Special Court, Mumbai and were then remanded to police custody and on 27.5.2020 were subsequently remanded to judicial custody. The High Court while granting default bail to the applicants formulated the following question for decision: C “Whether in computing the remand period of 60 or 90 days as contemplated in proviso (a) of Section 167 (2) of CrPC, the day of remand is to be included or excluded.” 13. The applicants contended before the High Court that they were arrested on 14.5.2020 and on the very same day, they were remanded by the Magistrate and such remand s came to be passed D from time to time. As per the ED, on 11.7.2020, (i.e. a Saturday), a complaint was filed by them, through e-mail and it was argued by the applicants that this was only a forward but not the entire complaint. On 13.7.2020 i.e. Monday, the ED filed the physical complaint before the Court. Based on these facts, the applicants’ counsel submitted that the E period of 60 days from the date of remand of the applicants (14.5.2020) expired on 12.7.2020 (Sunday) and the applicants on 13.7.2020 sought enlargement on default bail, under the proviso (a) (ii) of Section 167 (2), CrPC. Initially, the applications were transmitted through e-mail at around 8:53 AM and after about two hours on 13.7.2020, at around 11 AM, the bail applications were presented for physical filing in the Sessions Court F and a token acknowledging the filing was issued and the applications were also numbered. 14. The ED claimed to have filed the complaint through e-mail on 11.7.2020 followed by a physical application on 13.7.2020. As per the ED, relying on Rustam(supra), the 60 day period ends on 13.7.2020 G (wherein it seeks to exclude the date of remand i.e. 14.5.2020). Thus, as per the ED, complaint was filed in time. 15. The learned Special Court denied default bail on 14.7.2020 with the understanding that the 60 days’ time limit for filing the complaint expired. The learned Judge opined that the date of remand will have to H ENFORCEMENT DIRECTORATE, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA v. 931 KAPIL WADHAWAN & ANR. ETC. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] be excluded and the 60 days period will have to be computed from 15th A May 2020. With this reasoning the bail application came to be rejected. 16. On respondents’ challenge to the rejection of their default bail applications, the High Court after analyzing the implication of the rival submissions and interpreting the statutory provisions and their applications to the facts of the case, concluded that the learned Special Judge B incorrectly excluded the date of remand, while computing the 60 day period. Since the chargesheet by the ED was filed on 13.7.2020, being beyond 60 days by including the day of remand i.e. 14.5.2020, the applicants were found to be entitled to default bail. Accordingly, a direction was issued for release of the respondents by adverting to the provisions C of Section 167 (2) of the CrPC, subject to the accused persons furnishing their bail bonds.
