33. One of the contentions raised by the petitioners is that the Delimitation Act, 2002 contemplates the constitution of only one Delimitation Commission and not more than one. As noted earlier, the Delimitation Act, 2002 was made applicable for the first time to the D State of Jammu and Kashmir with effect from 31st October 2019. Even the Delimitation Acts of 1962 and 1972 were not applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. By virtue of the J&K Reorganisation Act, not only provisions of the Delimitation Act, 2002 were made applicable to the Union Territory of J & K, but a mandatory duty of readjustment of the constituencies in the Union Territory both of the Legislative Assembly E and Parliament was entrusted to the Delimitation Commission by sub- Sections (2) and (3) of Section 62. Till 31st October 2019, the Delimitation Commission for the State/Union Territory of J & K under the Delimitation Act, 2002 could not have been established as the said enactment was not made applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir till then. F 34. Sub-section (6) of Section 10 of the Delimitation Act, 2002 reads thus: “10. Publication of s and their date of operation.— xxx xxx xxx G (6) The Commission shall endeavour to complete and publish each of its s referred to in sub-section (1) in the manner provided in that sub-section, 2 [within a period not later than 31st day of July, 2008] under section 3.” Sub-section (6) uses the word “endeavour”. Section 10A of the H Delimitation Act, 2002 itself indicates that the time limit of 31st July 2008 HAJI ABDUL GANI KHAN & ANR. v. UNION OF INDIA & 545 ORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.] fixed under sub-Section (6) of Section 10 is not sacrosanct as it confers A a power on the Hon’ble President to defer the delimitation exercise in a State under certain circumstances. Thus, the time limit provided in sub- section (6) of Section 10 was never intended to be mandatory. While amending Section 2(f) of the Delimitation Act by the J&K Reorganisation Act, sub-section (6) of Section 10 has not been amended for enlarging B the period provided thereunder. However, the intention of the legislature as reflected in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act is crystal clear. The very fact that the duty of making the readjustment as per sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 62 on the basis of the 2011 census figures has been entrusted to the Delimitation Commission suggests that the legislature intended that the Delimitation C Commission for the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir will remain unaffected by the requirement of completing the exercise by the end of July 2008. The provisions of sub-Sections (2) and (3) of Section 62 will have to be interpreted in a manner that gives effect to the intention of the legislature. If it is held that due to the failure of the legislature to D modify the time limit provided in sub-Section (6) of Section 10 of the Delimitation Act, 2002, the Central Government is powerless to appoint a Delimitation Commission for the newly created Union territory, the provisions of Section 62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act will be rendered nugatory.
