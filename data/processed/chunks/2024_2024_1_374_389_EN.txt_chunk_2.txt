He submitted that the so-called subsequent payments on 16.12.1990 of Rs.1,000/-; on 15.04.1991 of Rs.3,000/-, and; on 17.09.1991 of Rs.2,500/- though were not actually paid to the appellants and even without admitting the same and accepting it for the sake of argument, the same is incorrect as the fingerprint expert has found the thumb- impression of the appellant no.1 as not matching the admitted actual sample thumb-impression of the appellant no.1. and, thus, the very basis of holding that time was not the essence of the agreement gets washed away. It was submitted that the Agreement stipulated that if there was default on the part of the respondents, the advance paid would be forfeited, and the entitlement to obtain the Sale Deed and get possession free from all encumbrances would also end. 5. It was submitted that once the fingerprint has been disapproved of by an expert and such report has been brought before the First Appellate Court, the claim based on such a document on which forgery has been committed itself renders the whole transaction inadmissible in law on the well-settled principle that the respondents did not come before the Court with clean hands as the entire claim was based on a forged document. 6. It was submitted that the claim of the respondents to have paid Rs.3,000/- on 18.09.1992; Rs.1,800/- on 24.07.1996; Rs.1,300/- on 25.07.1996 and Rs.1,000/- on 29.07.1996 i.e., a total of Rs.20,425/- 378 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and ultimately Rs.1,000/- on 21.04.1997 i.e., an excess of Rs. 425/- over the amount indicated in the Agreement, was false. 7. Learned counsel submitted that the endorsement(s) made not having been proved, it cannot be assumed that the respondents were ready and willing, or that they had, in fact, paid the excess amount. 8. It was contended that the Legal Notice sent on behalf of the respondents dated 18.11.1997 was clearly to get over the fatal lapses on their part and to give life to a dead cause i.e., revive the Agreement, which already stood incapable of being executed through Court due to efflux of time. On this issue, the contention was that readiness and willingness must be pleaded and proved which has not been done as is clear from the averments made in the plaint filed by the respondents. Thus, it was submitted that the trial court and even the First Appellate Court not recording any finding on the aspect of the readiness and willingness on the part of the respondents, the High Court’s observation in the Impugned Judgement on readiness and willingness of the respondents is without basis. 9. Learned counsel submitted that readiness and willingness has to be specifically pleaded and proved as per Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as the “1963 Act”) and there cannot be any question of drawing inference. Thus, he submitted that the respondents were obliged to obtain stamp-paper and draw up the Sale Deed, of which there is no indication in the plaint.
