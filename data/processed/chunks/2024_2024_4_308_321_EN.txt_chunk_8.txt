and another3, wherein it was observed thus: ‘28. So far as the inherent power of the High Court as contained in Section 482 CrPC is concerned, the law in this regard is set at rest by this Court in a catena of decisions. However, we would like to reiterate that when an , not interlocutory in nature, can be assailed in the High Court in revisional jurisdiction, then there should be a bar in invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court. In other words, inherent power of the Court can be exercised when there is no remedy provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure for redressal of the grievance. It is well settled that the inherent power of the Court can ordinarily be exercised when there is no express provision in the Code under which impugned can be challenged. 29. Courts possess inherent power in other statute also like the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), Section 151 whereof deals with such power. Section 151 CPC reads: “151. Saving of inherent powers of court.—Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the court to make such s as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the court.” 3 [2013] 7 SCR. 86 : (2013) 7 SCC 789 320 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 30. This Court in Padam Sen v. State of U.P. [AIR 1961 SC 218 : (1961) 1 Cri LJ 322] regarding inherent power of the Court under Section 151 CPC observed: (AIR p. 219, para 8) “8. … The inherent powers of the court are in addition to the powers specifically conferred on the court by the Code. They are complementary to those powers and therefore it must be held that the Court is free to exercise them for the purposes mentioned in Section 151 of the Code when the exercise of those powers is not in any way in conflict with what has been expressly provided in the Code or against the intentions of the legislature. It is also well recognised that the inherent power is not to be exercised in a manner which will be contrary to or different from the procedure expressly provided in the Code.” 31. In a Constitution Bench decision rendered in Manohar Lal Chopra v. Seth Hiralal [AIR 1962 SC 527] , this Court held that: (AIR p. 537, para 43) “43. … The inherent jurisdiction of the court to make s ex debito justitiae is undoubtedly affirmed by Section 151 of the Code, but [inherent] jurisdiction cannot be exercised so as to nullify the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. Where the Code of Civil Procedure deals expressly with a particular matter, the provision should normally be regarded as exhaustive.” 32. The intention of the legislature enacting the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Code of Civil Procedure vis-à-vis the law laid down by this Court it can safely be concluded that when there is a specific remedy provided by way of appeal or revision the inherent power under Section 482 CrPC or Section 151 CPC cannot and should not be resorted to.’ 24.
