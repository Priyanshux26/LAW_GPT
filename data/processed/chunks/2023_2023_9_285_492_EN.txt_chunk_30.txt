The D argument that Section 11(6A) deals with “existence”, as opposed to Section 8, Section 16, and Section 45, which deal with “validity” of an arbitration agreement is answered by this Court’s understanding of the expression “existence” in Hyundai Engg. Case as followed by us.” E 34. We may notice that in Section 45 of the Act, for the words ‘unless it finds’, by Act 33 of 2019, the words ‘unless it prima facie finds’, were substituted. This amounted to a legislative recognition of the position taken by this Court through the rendered by Justice B. N. Srikrishna in SMS Tea Estates (supra). F 35. In Mayavati Trading (P) Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman20, a Bench of three learned Judges of this Court inter alia held as follows: 10. This being the position, it is clear that the law prior to the 2015 Amendment that has been laid down by this Court, which would have included going into whether accord and satisfaction G has taken place, has now been legislatively overruled. This being the position, it is difficult to agree with the reasoning contained in the aforesaid [United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd., (2019) 5 SCC 362 : (2019) H 20 (2019) 8 SCC 714 M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 327 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] 2 SCC (Civ) 785], as Section 11(6-A) is confined to the A examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement and is to be understood in the narrow sense as has been laid down in the in Duro Felguera, SA [Duro Felguera, SA v. Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764] — see paras 48 & 59 [Ed. : The said paras 48 & 59 B of Duro Felguera, SA v. Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764, for ready reference, read as follows:”48. Section 11(6-A) added by the 2015 Amendment, reads as follows:”11. (6-A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6), C shall, notwithstanding any , decree or of any court, confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.”(emphasis supplied)From a reading of Section 11(6-A), the intention of the legislature is crystal clear i.e. the court should and need only look into one aspect—the D existence of an arbitration agreement. What are the factors for deciding as to whether there is an arbitration agreement is the next question. The resolution to that is simple—it needs to be seen if the agreement contains a clause which provides for arbitration pertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the parties to the agreement.***59. The scope of the power E under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act was considerably wide in view of the decisions in SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618 and National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC 267 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ) 117.
