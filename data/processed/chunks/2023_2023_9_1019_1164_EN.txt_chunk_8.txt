When the land has been assigned in the year 1994 in favour of the CMDA by way of the Gift Deed, neither the CMDA nor the Corporation of Chennai have taken any step to make use of the land for the interest of public. It is clear from the report filed F by the Advocate-Commissioner and the photographs filed before us and the other materials available on record that in the OSR area, there is a katcha road, which is said to have been laid by the Corporation in the year 2003. Probably because of this katcha road and the usage of the same as road by all the residents in the G locality, the occupants of the Vasanth Apartments might have felt disturbance, which would have prompted them to make a representation to the Corporation to develop a park in the said area or in the alternative to permit them to develop and maintain a park for their recreational purpose besides illegally constructing a compound wall, separating the petrol bunk and the compound wall H 1034 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R.
