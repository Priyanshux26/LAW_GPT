The developments of the last few decades of British rule in India vis-à-vis minority rights directly contributed to the discussions in the Constituent Assembly Debates and the formalisation of safeguards for minorities within the Indian Constitution.34 In fact, it strengthened the belief of the makers of the Indian Constitution that the Indian State must be formally committed to protecting the distinct cultural, linguistic and religious practices of various communities.35 23. Thus, to streamline the complex task of drafting the Indian Constitution, the Constituent Assembly decided to work through specialized committees. Among these, the Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minorities, etc., was formed under the leadership of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, having proportional representation from all major minority groups.36 Given the broad mandate of this Committee, it was further divided into five Sub-Committees, one of which was the Minorities Sub-Committee, chaired by Dr. H.C. Mookherjee, a prominent Christian leader.37 24. Soon after, the Advisory Committee prepared the ‘Report on Minority Rights’, which recommended that elections to all legislatures be conducted on the basis of joint electorates, with reservations for specified minorities.38 Additionally, the Report also proposed reservation in recruitment for minorities. The Report further incorporated suggestions for establishing Constitutional and Administrative mechanisms to address the challenges faced by minorities in India. 32 Rochana Bajpai, supra note 18. 33 Krishna, K.B., The Problem of Minorities in India or Communal Representation in India, G.
