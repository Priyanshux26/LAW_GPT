But, the very nature of the power has led the Court to set limits to itself within which to exercise such power. It is now the well established practice of this Court to permit the invocation of the power under Article 136 only in very exceptional circumstances, as when a question of law of general public importance arises or a decision shocks the conscience of the Court. But, within the restrictions imposed by itself, this Court has the undoubted power to interfere even with findings of fact, making no distinction between s of acquittal and conviction, if the High Court, in arriving at those findings, has acted 95 [1979] 3 SCR 482 : (1979) 2 SCC 297 1248 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “perversely or otherwise improperly”. (See State of Madras v. A. Vaidyanatha Iyer [AIR 1958 SC 61 : [1958] SCR 580 : 1958 Cri LJ 232] and Himachal Pradesh Administration v. Om Prakash [(1972) 1 SCC 249 : [1972] 2 SCR 765])…….” 5. A doubt has been raised about the competence of a private party, as distinguished from the State, to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution against a of acquittal by the High Court. We do not see any substance in the doubt. Appellate power vested in the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution is not to be confused with ordinary appellate power exercised by appellate courts and Appellate Tribunals under specific statutes.As we said earlier, it is a plenary power, ‘exercisable outside the purview of ordinary law’ to meet the pressing demands of justice (vide Durga Shankar Mehta v. Thakur Raghuraj Singh [AIR 1954 SC 520 : [1955] 1 SCR 267 : 1954 SCJ 723]). Article 136 of the Constitution neither confers on anyone the right to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court nor inhibits anyone from invoking the Court’s jurisdiction. The power is vested in the Supreme Court but the right to invoke the Court’s jurisdiction is vested in no one. The exercise of the power of the Supreme Court is not circumscribed by any limitation as to who may invoke it. …….. Appeals under Article 136 of the Constitution are entertained by special leave granted by this Court, whether it is the State or a private party that invokes the jurisdiction of this Court, special leave is not granted as a matter of course but only for good and sufficient reasons, as well established by the practice of this Court.” [emphasis added] 19.2. In P.S.R. Sadhanantham v. Arunachalam,96 a Constitution Bench of five judges elaborated the content and character 96 [1980] 2 SCR 873 : (1980) 3 SCC 141 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1249 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation of Article 136 vis-à-vis Article 21 and made the following observations: “7. Specificity being essential to legality, let us see if the broad spectrum spread out of Article 136 fills the bill from the point of view of “procedure established by law”.
