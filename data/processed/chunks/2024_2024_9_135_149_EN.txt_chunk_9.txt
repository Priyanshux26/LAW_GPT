20. We are only dealing with the M.A. No. 267 of 2024 where the appellant has prayed that he should be reinstated into service as Civil Judge with all consequential benefits in view of the dated 20.04.2022 passed by this Court allowing the appeal. 21. Once the termination is set aside and of the High Court dismissing the writ petition challenging the said termination has also been set aside, the natural consequence is that the employee should be taken back in service and thereafter proceeded with as per the directions. Once the termination is set aside then the employee is deemed to be in service. We find no justification in the inaction of the High Court and also the State in not taking back the appellant into service after the dated 20.04.2022. No decision was taken either by the High Court or by the State of taking back the appellant into service and no decision was made regarding the back wages from the date the termination had been passed till the date of reinstatement which should be the date of the of this Court. In any case, the appellant was entitled to salary from the date of dated 20.04.2022 till fresh termination was passed on 02.04.2024. The appellant would thus be entitled to full salary for the above period to be calculated with all benefits admissible treating the appellant to be in continuous service. 22. Insofar as the period from 18.12.2009 i.e., after the termination of 17.12.2009 was passed till 19.04.2022 the date prior to the and of this Court, we are of the view that ends of justice would be served by directing that the appellant would be entitled to 50 percent of the back wages treating him to be in service continuously. Such back wages to be calculated with all benefits admissible under law to the appellant as if he was in service. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 149 Anantdeep Singh v. The High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh & Anr. 23. Insofar as the challenge to the resolution of the Full Court of the High Court dated 03.08.2023 and termination dated 02.04.2024 is concerned, the appellant would be at liberty to challenge the same by way of a writ petition before the High Court which may be decided on its own merits totally uninfluenced by any observations made in this . The facts and observations made are only with respect to the disposal of the M.A. No. 267 of 2024. 24. M.A. stands disposed of accordingly. Result of the case: M.A. disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
