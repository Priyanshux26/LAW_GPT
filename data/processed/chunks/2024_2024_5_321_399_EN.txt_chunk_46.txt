120. A preliminary contention was raised by the original defendants that the original plaintiff chose to institute a civil suit for recovery of money, rather than following the process prescribed under Section 6 of the 1993 Act, which provides for the referring of a dispute arising under the 1993 Act to arbitration before the Industry Facilitation Council, and thus for this reason, the suit for recovery, which is expressly suspended under Section 22(1) of the Act, should be held as not maintainable. It was also argued that even otherwise no interest should be granted on the amount claimed as due since the mechanism prescribed under Section 6(2) of the 1993 Act was not followed. 121. Section 6 of the 1993 Act reads as follows: “6. Recovery of amount due - (1) The amount due from a buyer, together with the amount of interest calculated in accordance with the provisions of sections 4 and 5, shall be recoverable by the supplier from the buyer by way of a suit or other proceeding under any law for the time being in force. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), any party to a dispute may make a reference to the Industry Facilitation Council for acting as an arbitrator or conciliator in respect of the matters referred to in that sub-section and the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) shall apply to such dispute as if the arbitration or conciliation were pursuant to an arbitration agreement referred to in sub-section (1) of section 7 of that Act.” 122. We do not find any force in this contention of the original defendants. Section 6 merely provides that for the purpose of recovery of the amounts due under the 1993 Act, a supplier may make a reference to the Industries Facilitation Council, which is established under Section 7A of the 1993 Act. First, at the time of the institution of the suit by the original plaintiff, the Industries Facilitation Councils didn’t exist as the provision for their establishment was only brought in vide an amendment in 1998. Secondly, even otherwise, Section 6(2) of the 1993 Act merely provides for an alternate avenue to the supplier in 388 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports addition to a suit or any other legal proceedings as mentioned in Section 6(1) of the 1993 Act. 123. It is also pertinent to mention that in the absence of the express permission of the BIFR, Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act suspends any legal proceedings in the nature of execution during the pendency of the scheme before the BIFR, as execution would necessarily result in negatively impacting the assets of a sick company, thereby affecting the preparation, sanction or implementation of scheme and as a net effect, would bring down the chances of revival of the sick company. 124. In the present case, the suit was decreed in favour of the original plaintiff by the trial court vide its dated 19.09.2001. However, while the adjudication of the suit of the original plaintiff could not have been said to be barred under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act as it was for the mere determination of liability of the parties inter-se, the execution of decree obtained as a result thereof was expressly suspended during the period as mentioned in the said provision, unless the requisite permission from the BIFR or the AAIFR could be obtained.
