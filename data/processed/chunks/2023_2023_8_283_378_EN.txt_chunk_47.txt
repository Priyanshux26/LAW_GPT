If on account of the said statement, the land has to be construed as Mathruka, we do not know how and why after the death of Khurshid Jah these lands also G went into the hands of Paigah Committee. In any case, these are the questions which could not have been decided by the Court in a suit for partition. 154. The of the Nazim Atiyat dated 30.10.1968 and the Muntakhab issued by the Commissioner on 14.02.1983 could not have H 354 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A been produced before the Trial Judge in CS No.14 of 1958, as these documents came into existence after the and preliminary decree dated 28.06.1963. 155. It must be remembered that the entire basis of the claim of the appellants is that as per the preliminary decree these properties were B Mathruka properties. But the same is not borne out by the findings recorded by the Trial Judge in 27 pages of his dated 28.06.1963 on Issue Nos. 7(a) and 7(b). 156. Much was sought to be made, out of the finding recorded by the Nazim Atiyat Court that the lands in Hafeezpet and Hydernagar C included at Serial Nos.380 and 381 in the notification as per Appendix ‘F’ to the of Nazim Atiyat was Inam-al-Tamgha. The annexure to the of the Nazim Atiyat describes what Inam-al-Tamghais. It reads as follows:- “1. The villages of S.No.380 and No.381 have been verified as “INAM AL-TAMGHA” in the name of Khurshid Jah Bahadur D as per “KAIFIYAT-I-JAGIRDARAN” of 1296H. The word “Tamgha” means “Royal Charter.” In the documents used for grant of Jagir or Inam to the Jagirdars or anyone else, there used to be a checklist of information about the Jagir/Inam/ Grant, to describe its nature, labelled as “Type of Jagir/Inam/Grant” E of land. The Jagir granted to Nawab Khurshid Jah Bahadur was “Inam-al-Tamgha”, granted to him either in recognition of his services or in lieu of any Jagir/land or plot of land acquired by the Govt. out of his personal property for any specific purpose like laying of road/railway line or construction of any public facility F etc.” 157. As we have stated elsewhere, the of the Nazim Atiyat was not before the Trial Judge. The Trial Judge did not record a finding that it was Inam-al-Tamgha. In any case, it was only a suit for partition. 158. Even if we assume that it was Inam-al-Tamgha, then a G question arises as to whether the same stood abolished after the advent of the Hyderabad Abolition of Inams Act, 1955 (Act No.VIII of 1955)17. This Act defines the word “Inam” under Section 2(1)(c) to mean the land held under a gift or a grant made by the Nizam or by any H 17 for short “1955 Act” M/s TRINITY INFRAVENTURES LTD. & ORS.
