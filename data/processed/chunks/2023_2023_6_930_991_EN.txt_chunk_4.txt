Section 49A of the 1960 Act also provided on similar terms as provided H SABIR ALI KHAN v. SYED MOHD. AHMAD ALI KHAN AND 935 OTHERS in Section 51(1) of the Act that for a sale of property comprised in A a waqf, previous sanction of the Board was necessary. As far as Sections 49A and 49B came to be inserted by Act 28 of 1971 and the second sale took place in 1974, which is after the insertion of Sections 49A and 49B in the 1960 Act, therefore, the power, indeed, vested with the Board to take action for recovery of B possession under Section 49B. Under Section 112(3) of the Act, it is proceeded on the basis that the 1960 Act would stand repealed. However, the proviso declares that the repeal would not affect the previous operation of the corresponding law. The corresponding law, in this case is Section 49A read with Section 49B. Action taken in the exercise of the power thereunder, is to C be deemed as taken in the exercise of powers under the Act. The powers under the Act must be treated as flowing from Section 52 of the Act. The proviso to Section 112(3) provides that the provisions in the Act, which in this case would be Section 52, must be treated as being on the Statute Book. [Para 40][975-D- D H] 1.9. The waqf in question is created by the father by deed dated 26.07.1934. It is, no doubt, a waqf-alalaulad. A waqf-alal- aulad is a waqf under Mohammaden Law. [Para 43][976-D] 1.10. Section 3 of the Mussalman Wakf Act, 1923 obliged E the Mutawalli to furnish statement containing certain particulars to the competent Court. Notice of the Statement was to be published under Section 4. The 1923 Act provided for audit of accounts and the provision for expense which could be incurred by the Mutawalli came to be inserted. Section 10 provided for F penalty. Certain waqfs were excluded from its purview under Section 12. In the United Provinces, which meant the United Provinces of Agra and Awadh, the 1936 Act, came to be enacted. [Para 45][977-E-F] 1.11. No doubt, the Court was dealing with a case of a waqf- alal-aulad. The must essentially be viewed in the G context of the definition of ‘religious and charitable purpose’ provided in the Act in question. [Para 49][980-A] H 936 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 1.12. The Wakf in question is dated 26.07.1934. The 1936 Act applied to Wakfs created before or after the commencement of the Act. However, Section 2(2) declares that the Act shall not apply to certain waqfs. They included a waqf whereunder not less than 75 per cent of the total income, after deduction of certain sums, was for the time being payable for the benefit of the waqif B or his descendants. However, Section 38(1) of the 1936 Act made it clear that every waqf, whether subject to the Act or not and whether created or after the commencement of the 1936 Act, shall be registered.
