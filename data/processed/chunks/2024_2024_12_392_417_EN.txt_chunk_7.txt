The recovery of the knife, facilitated by a disclosure statement from appellant, lent further credence to the prosecution’s case. 402 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 19. The High Court also addressed the appellant’s argument that the testimony of PW-1 was unreliable due to alleged embellishments regarding the number of stab injuries. The Court rejected this contention, noting that minor omissions in the First Information Statement (FIS) could not undermine the credibility of PW-1’s account, especially given the traumatic circumstances under which the FIS was recorded. The court reasoned that PW-1, having sustained a stab injury himself, may not have been able to provide exhaustive details at the time but consistently identified appellant – accused no. 1 as the primary assailant. The testimony of PW-2, an independent eyewitness, corroborated PW-1’s account, further strengthening the prosecution’s case against appellant. 20. The High Court concluded that the actions of appellant demonstrated clear intent to cause death. The deliberate targeting of vital organs with a sharp weapon indicated premeditation or, at the very least, the formation of intent during the incident. The court observed that while the altercation may have initially involved the use of sticks, appellant’s decision to escalate the violence by drawing and using a knife was an intentional and unilateral act. This conduct set him apart from the other accused, whose actions were limited to assaulting the victims with sticks. 21. In contrast, accused nos. 2 and 3 were found guilty of lesser offenses under Section 326 IPC for causing grievous hurt to PW-1. The evidence established that they used sticks to beat PW-1, resulting in non-fatal injuries, including a fracture to his leg. The High Court concurred with the Trial Court’s finding that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Accused Nos. 2 and 3 shared a common intention with appellant to commit murder. The court noted that there was no evidence to suggest that they were aware of the knife concealed by appellant or his intent to use it. This lack of knowledge precluded the application of Section 34, IPC to hold them vicariously liable for the murder. 22. The High Court underscored the principle that liability must be determined based on the specific actions and intentions of each accused. While accused nos. 2 and 3 were complicit in the assault, their participation did not extend to the homicidal attack perpetrated by accused no. 1. The court further noted that the initial assault with sticks did not indicate a pre-arranged plan to kill the deceased. Had [2024] 12 S.C.R. 403 Kunhimuhammed@Kunheethu v. The State of Kerala there been such an intention, the attack would have begun with the use of the knife rather than sticks. 23. The High court also dismissed the appellant’s plea for leniency based on parity with the co-accused. It emphasized that the role of appellant was materially different and far more culpable than that of accused Nos. 2 and 3. The fatal injuries inflicted by appellant on the deceased were deliberate, targeted, and intended to cause death, whereas the actions of the co-accused were confined to non-fatal assaults on PW-1.
