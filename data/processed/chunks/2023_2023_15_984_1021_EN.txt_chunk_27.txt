Respondent no(s). 1 and 2 have continuously put spokes on the wheels of justice as protracted proceedings have helped them to be in possession for over two decades, notwithstanding the expiry of the lease way back in the year 1999. We do not wish to say much on the conduct of respondents no(s). 1 and 2 as the facts narrated speak for themselves. The Act 27 of 2013 is certainly a procedural amendment and therefore, has to be applied retrospectively in the context of change of forum and jurisdictional provisions. As stated, we are in respectful agreement with the decision rendered in Rashid Wali Beg (Supra). The amendment has been brought forth in to get over the MUMTAZ YARUD DOWLA WAKF v. M/S BADAM 1021 BALAKRISHNA HOTEL PVT. LTD. & ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] interpretation given in Ramesh Gobindram (Supra). Therefore, we have no hesitation in setting aside the impugned passed by the High Court in C.R.P. No. 1264 of 2021 dated 23.11.2021, by restoring the one passed by the Executing Court, i.e. the Court of the III-Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court at Hyderabad in E.P. No. 29 of 2014 dated 10.08.2021. The appeal stands allowed. No costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Divya Pandey
