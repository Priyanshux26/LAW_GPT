Mohindroo v. Distt. Judge, Delhi [(1971) 3 SCC 5 : (1971) 2 SCR 11, 27]. …. [Emphasis supplied] [2024] 12 S.C.R. 255 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. 65. This Court in Yashwant Sinha v. CBI reported in (2020) 2 SCC 338, has observed that if a relevant law has been ignored while arriving at a decision, it would make the decision amenable to review. The relevant observations read as follows: “78. The view of this Court, in Girdhari Lal Gupta [Girdhari Lal Gupta v. D.H. Mehta (1971) 3 SCC 189 : 1971 SCC (Cri) 279 : AIR 1971 SC 2162 : (1971) 3 SCR 748] as also in Deo Narain Singh [Deo Narain Singh v. Daddan Singh, 1986 Supp SCC 530] , has been noticed to be that if the relevant law is ignored or an inapplicable law forms the foundation for the , it would provide a ground for review. If a court is oblivious to the relevant statutory provisions, the would, in fact, be per incuriam. No doubt, the concept of per incuriam is apposite in the context of its value as the precedent but as between the parties, certainly it would be open to urge that a rendered, in ignorance of the applicable law, must be reviewed. The , in such a case, becomes open to review as it would betray a clear error in the decision.” [Emphasis supplied] 66. In Sow Chandra Kant and Anr. v. Sheikh Habib reported in (1975) 1 SCC 674, this Court held: “1. Mr Daphtary, learned counsel for the petitioners, has argued at length all the points which were urged at the earlier stage when we refused special leave thus making out that a review proceeding virtually amounts to a re-hearing. May be, we were not right is refusing special leave in the first round; but, once an has been passed by this Court, a review thereof must be subject to the rules of the game and cannot be lightly entertained. A review of a is a serious step and reluctant resort to it is proper only where a glaring omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility. A mere repetition, through different counsel, of old and overruled arguments, a second trip over ineffectually covered ground or minor mistakes of inconsequential import are obviously insufficient. The 256 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports very strict need for compliance with these factors is the rationale behind the insistence of counsel’s certificate which should not be a routine affair or a habitual step. It is neither fairness to the Court which decided nor awareness of the precious public time lost what with a huge backlog of dockets waiting in the queue for disposal, for counsel to issue easy certificates for entertainment of review and fight over again the same battle which has been fought and lost. The Bench and the Bar, we are sure, are jointly concerned in the conservation of judicial time for maximum use.
