571 [SANJAY KAROL, J.] the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States “in to A appreciate the true nature, scope and extent of this right”. This observation comes in addition to and despite having taken note of the warnings issued in State of Travancore – Cochin and Others v. Bombay Co. Ltd31 (five-Judge Bench) and State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala32 (five-Judge Bench). This was, however, after having duly recognized B the “paucity of authority in India on the nature, scope and extent of this fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression enshrined under article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution”, at that point in time. 25. This observation of Justice N.H. Bhagwati has been further followed in Reliance Petrochemicals Ltd. v. Proprietors of Indian C Express Newspapers, Bombay Pvt. Ltd. and Ors.33 (two-Judge Bench) wherein the effect of Article 19 on the freedom of press was in question.34 The court while making reference to US and UK decisions in Nebraska Press Association v. Hugh Stuart35, John D. Pennekamo v. State of Florida36 and Attorney General v. British Broadcasting Corporation37, held that there was no reason for the injunction in question, D to continue.38 26. In R.K. Garg v. Union of India39 (five-Judge Bench), a Constitution Bench, placed reliance on the Supreme Court of United States decisions in Morey v. Doud40 and Secy. of Agriculture v. Central Roig Refining Co.41 to hold that the courts cannot be converted into E tribunals for relief from inequalities in economic legislations.42 27. An observation by Lord Denning in Ghani v. Jones43 quoted with approval in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India44 (seven-Judge Bench), is worth reproducing herein. It reads, “a man’s liberty of F 31 1952 SCR 1112 32 1957 SCR 874 33 (1988) 4 SCC 592 34 Paragraph 10. 35 427 US 539 36 (1945) 90 L Ed 331 37 (1979) 3 All ER 45 G 38 Paragraph 20 - 22, 38. 39 (1981) 4 SCC 675 40 354 US 457 (1957) 41 338 US 604 (1949) 42 Paragraph 8. 43 (1970) 1 QB 693 44 (1978) 1 SCC 248 H 572 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A movement is regarded so highly by the law of England that it is not to be hindered or prevented except on surest grounds”. It is then, by extension, without a shadow of doubt, a sure ground for the restriction of liberty, in the present case of association, if the legislature, after following procedure established by law, found appropriate reasons to restrict such right, in particular, with banned organizations. B 28. The purpose of delving into both nature of decisions, where s of the United States Supreme Court have and have not been relied on, is to demonstrate that in certain cases reference to those s is justified. Such reference though, needless to say, has to be appreciated in the light of our own constitutional, legislative as well as C judicial, historic perspective. They cannot, as was done in the Arup Bhuyan and Indra Das referred to this bench, form the sole basis for the conclusion arrived at.
