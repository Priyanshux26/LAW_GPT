Bearing in mind the position of law thus revealed it is to be considered whether judicial review is called for or not in respect of the challenge of the appellant against his removal E from service without holding an inquiry in invocation of the power under Clause (iii) of Rule 16 of the CCA Rules. [Para 16][790-C- F] 1.2 It is obvious that the appellant himself knew that he is a high-profile scientist in ISRO, which is a highly sensitive and F strategic research and development organisation under the Department of Space, Government of India. The Court cannot be an island and feign oblivion of the pivotal role of a scientist/ engineer attached to ISRO and also the role of ISRO as the space agency of India. Obviously, it is involved in science, engineering G and technology to harvest the benefits of outer space for India. The appellant is a scientist/engineer in the VSSC, Thiruvananthapuram of ISRO. After applying for sabbatical leave for one year and when the competent authority decided not to recommend the leave in exigency of service, he applied for nine days’ earned leave from 21.08.2003 to 29.08.2003 on personal H 774 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A grounds and then went to South Korea. On reaching South Korea, through e- mail dated 01.09.2003, the appellant intimated his Divisional Head in VSSC regarding his arrival in South Korea to carry out his post-doctoral research and to assist Prof. H.D. Kim, Head of School of Mechanical Engineering, Andong National University, South Korea. Though his application dated 18.07.2003 B was not sanctioned, through another e-mail, he applied for 89 days’ leave from 01.09.2003 to 28.11.2003 and continued to stay in South Korea despite being informed that his leave was not sanctioned and was required to report for duty not later than 11.09.2003. It is also to be noted that before going to South Korea C to join the aforesaid University, he had published a technical paper as first author with a foreigner as one of the co-authors in the 39th American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Joint Propulsion Conference, USA, without obtaining approval of the competent authority. Though he rejoined duty on 27.03.2004 with full knowledge that his application for sabbatical D leave was not sanctioned he left for South Korea in March, 2004 without giving information to and obtaining permission from the organization. He re-joined duty on 18.05.2004 and then, went back to South Korea on 28.05.2004 without permission from the authorities. The said factual aspects would reveal that without E permission from the competent authority the appellant went to South Korea, joined Andong National University, South Korea and assisted Prof. H.D. Kim, Head of School of Mechanical Engineering and kept on his association with the said foreign institution involved in the research on rocketry, which is a strategic research and development subject in ISRO. Annexure- F P1 letter dated 28.08.2002 from Prof. H.D. Kim to himself, produced by the appellant, would reveal the nature of the research project in the laboratory of Prof. H.D.
