12. Aggrieved by the of the High Court dated 29.07.2005, the landlord fi led a special leave petition before this Court. Leave to appeal was granted by dated 9.12.2014. 13. We have heard Mr. Vijay Hansaria, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant-landlord and Mr. Ravinder Keshavrao Adsure, learned counsel for the respondents. 14. The submissions of Mr. Vijay Hansaria, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant-landlord can be summarized in the following points:  The High Court fell into error in relying on the decisions in the case of Maruti Namdeo Gade (supra) and Hariba Keshav Barbole (supra). The date for determining the bonafi des of the requirement of lands for personal cultivation ought to have been determined as on date of fi ling the application and subsequent events thereon, like death of the landlord, ought not to have any bearing on the decision of the dispute.  Both the original authority and the appellate authority had recorded a fi nding that the landlord’s holding does not exceed one economic holding. In that context, the revisional authority went beyond its jurisdictional boundaries in disturbing the said fi nding and holding that the landlord’s holding exceeds one unit of economic holding. 9 (1976) 78 Bom LR 602. 10 AIR 1975 Bom 137 KESHAV BHAURAO YEOLE (D) BY LRS. v. MURALIDHAR 943 (D) & ORS. [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.]  Even though the land leased in respect of Survey No. 290/1 & 290/2 are not for sugarcane cultivation, while determining the extent of land to be resumed to the landlord as per Section 33B(5) (b), the original authority is required to consider the total holding of both the landlord and the tenant. 15. The learned counsel for the respondent-tenant has supported the impugned and has canvassed the following contentions:  The notice for termination of tenancy dated 05.09.1975 having been issued only in respect of land bearing Survey No. 291, the scope of adjudication of this dispute must be limited to such land, as has been rightly noticed by the revisional authority.  The High Court and the revisional authority were justifi ed in remanding the case to the original authority since the facts necessary to decide whether the landlord’s holding was in excess of one unit of economic holding, was not forthcoming from the evidence on record.  The landlord held several other lands other than lands leased to the tenant, and was earning income through non-agricultural sources, which fact can be inquired into only on remand of the case. The holding of the landlord was clearly in excess of one economic unit, and therefore, Section 31A-31D has to be applied. Since the original authority has not framed any issue in this regard, it was essential that the case be remanded back for fresh determination. 16. Undisputedly, the notice for termination of tenancy has been issued only in respect of Survey No. 291 and it did not relate to Survey No.290/1 & 290/2. In fact, we have perused the original records and the original notice dated 05.09.1975 and are satisfi ed that termination notice has been issued only in respect of Survey No.291 and there is not even a whisper with regard to Survey No.290/1 & 290/2 in the notice dated 05.09.1975.
