These factors require that respondents Nos.3 to 13 be treated differently from other ordinary criminals. 17. Learned senior counsel, Ms. Indira Jaising, appearing for the petitioner in Writ Petition (Crl.) No.326 of 2022 in her rejoinder at the outset submitted that the State of Gujarat does not have a policy of any kind for the release of prisoners under Section 432 of the CrPC. That the 1992 Policy merely outlines the procedure to be followed when releasing convicts on remission. That the State must abide by the law laid down by this Court as well as the constitutional mandate to protect the fundamental rights of women, particularly when they are victims of sexual violence in relation to ethnic conflict. 17.1. Further, it was contended that the State of Gujarat is not the appropriate government and therefore the of this Court dated 13.05.2022 is per incuriam by virtue of failing to follow the binding precedent in V. Sriharan. That the impugning of the of the Gujarat High Court that held the State of 816 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Maharashtra to be the appropriate Government in Writ Petition (Crl.) No.135 of 2022, filed by respondent No.3, is completely contrary to the position of law laid down in Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar, wherein it was held that no writ petition alleging the violation of fundamental rights would lie against the judgement or of a court. That the respondent No.3 committed fraud on this Court by misrepresenting the of the Bombay High Court dated 05.08.2013 in Writ Petition(Crl.) No.135 of 2022. That the question of two High Courts taking “dramatically different views” did not arise as the issue of appropriate Government was not in question before the Bombay High Court at all. That this amounts to suppressio veri, expression falsi. That this Court in Union of India vs. Ramesh Gandhi, (2012) 1 SCC 476 (“Ramesh Gandhi”), has held that any judgement that is a consequence of misrepresentation of necessary facts would constitute fraud and would be treated as a nullity. That this error of the Court cannot lead to the deprivation of justice to the victims. While the criminal justice system must strive to adopt a reformative approach, proportionality of sentence must be treated as an equally important ideal. Reliance was placed on the judgements of this Court in Alister Anthony Pareira vs. State of Maharashtra, (2012) 2 SCC 648 (“Alister Anthony Pareira”), Ravji vs. State of Rajasthan, (1996) 2 SCC 175(“Ravji”) and Soman vs. State of Kerala, (2013) 11 SCC 382 (“Soman”). 18. Ms. Vrinda Grover, learned counsel for the petitioner in Writ Petition(Crl.) No.352 of 2022 reiterated the contentions as to the centrality and non-optional nature of seeking the opinion of the Presiding Judge under Section 432(2) of the CrPC, the non-serving of the concurrent sentences for the non-payment of fine by the respondent Nos.3 to 13 as well as the need to consider the nature of the crimes and the impact on public welfare while considering the grant of remission.
