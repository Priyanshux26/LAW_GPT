[2024] 1 S.C.R. 677 : 2024 INSC 58 Central Bureau of Investigation v. Kapil Wadhawan & Anr. (Criminal Appeal No. 391 of 2024) 24 January 2024 [Bela M. Trivedi* and Pankaj Mithal, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the respondents were entitled to the benefit of the statutory right conferred under the proviso to s.167(2), Cr.P.C, on the ground that the investigation qua some of the accused named in the FIR was pending, though the report u/s.173(2) against respondents along with the other accused was filed within the prescribed time limit and the cognizance of the offence was taken by the special court before the consideration of the application of the respondents seeking default bail u/s.167(2). Headnotes Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Proviso to s.167(2), s.173 – Statutory right conferred under Proviso to s.167(2) – Benefit of – When entitled to – FIR was registered for the offences punishable u/s.120-B r/w s.409, 420 and 477A, IPC and s.13(2) r/w s.13(1)(d), PC Act, 1988 – Chargesheet for the offences u/s.120B r/w s.206, 409, 411, 420, 424, 465, 468 and 477A, IPC and s.13(2) r/w 13(1)(d), PC Act was filed against 75 persons/ entities including the respondents-accused – Special Court took the cognizance of the alleged offences against all the accused and issued warrants/summons – Subsequently, Special Court holding that the investigation was incomplete and the chargesheet filed was in piecemeal, respondents were granted default bail u/s.167(2) – upheld by High Court: Held: The statutory requirement of the report/chargesheet u/s.173(2) would be complied with if the various details prescribed therein are included in the report – It is complete if it is accompanied with all the documents and statements of witnesses as required by s.175(5) and it is not necessary that all the details of the offence must be stated – The benefit of proviso appended to sub-section (2) of s.167 would be available to the offender only when a chargesheet is not filed and the investigation is kept pending against him – However, * Author 678 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports once a chargesheet is filed, the said right ceases – Thus, once from the material produced along with the chargesheet, the court is satisfied about the commission of an offence and takes cognizance of the offence allegedly committed by the accused, it is immaterial whether the further investigation in terms of s.173(8) is pending or not – The pendency of the further investigation qua the other accused or for production of some documents not available at the time of filing of chargesheet would neither vitiate the chargesheet, nor would it entitle the accused to claim right to get default bail on the ground that the chargesheet was an incomplete chargesheet or that the chargesheet was not filed in terms of s.173(2) – In the present case, the chargesheet having been filed against the respondents within the prescribed time limit and the cognizance having been taken by the Special Court of the offences allegedly committed by them, the respondents could not have claimed the statutory right of default bail u/s.167(2) on the ground that the investigation qua other accused was pending – Special Court as well as High Court committed serious error of law – Impugned s set aside.
