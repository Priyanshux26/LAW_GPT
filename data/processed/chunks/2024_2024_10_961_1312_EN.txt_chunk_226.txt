57. The above discussion of the provisions governing migrants, and in particular, migrants from Bangladesh elucidates the balance that Parliament has sought to draw between its humanitarian view towards migrants of Indian origin from Bangladesh and the impact of the huge influx on the economic and cultural resources of Indian States. With this background, I proceed to determine the constitutional validity of Section 6A on the anvil of Article 14. c. The scope of judicial review under Article 14 58. Before I proceed to deal with the issues, it is necessary that I summarise the scope of judicial review under Article 14. Courts have traditionally tested laws and executive actions for violation of Article 14 on the 85 The Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act 1983; Section 1(3): “It shall be deemed to have come into force in the State of Assam on the 15th day of October, 1983 and in any other State on such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint and different dates may be appointed for different States and references in this Act to the commencement of this Act shall be construed in relation to any State as reference to the date of commencement of this Act in such State.” [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1275 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 grounds of unreasonable classification86 and arbitrariness.87 Courts have adopted the two-prong test for unreasonable classification88 and the manifest arbitrariness standard.89 In Association for Democratic Reforms v. Union of India,90 writing for three other Judges of the Constitution Bench, I explained that the test of manifest arbitrariness includes the following two applications:91 a. The determination of whether the provision lacks an “adequate determining principle” or if the adequate determining principle is not in consonance with constitutional values; and b. If the provision does not make a classification by identifying the degrees of harm. These two applications have in the past also been subsumed in the traditional two-prong Article 14 analysis. In State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar,92 Justice S R Das observed that there must be a yardstick to differentiate those included in and excluded from the class.93 Since then, in addition to inquiring if there is a yardstick, this Court has also adopted a more intensive analysis of the yardstick adopted in the backdrop of constitutional values and provisions. For example, in the context of determining the backward class for the purpose of Article 15(4), this Court has held that a yardstick which measures social backwardness must be adopted.94 The degree of scrutiny of the yardstick used hinges on the nature of the right alleged to be violated. For example, the legislature has a greater latitude to choose the yardstick for classification in fiscal matters.95 However, the Court has adopted a stringent standard in determining the ‘rationality’ of the yardstick 86 See Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v.
