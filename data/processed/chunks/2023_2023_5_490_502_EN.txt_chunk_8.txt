The aforesaid stand would be just contrary to the directions issued by this Court in the case of Grah Rakshak (supra) and F the subsequent further clarificatory . Under the circumstances, the High Court has rightly directed to pay the DCA at Rs.533/- per day. As such we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court. Therefore, the appeals preferred by the State to that extent deserve dismissal. G 7. Now, so far as the appeals preferred by the original writ petitioners against the impugned and passed by the Division Bench of the High Court restricting the benefit of DCA at Rs.533/ - per day from January, 2020, is concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that no cogent reasons have been assigned by the Division Bench of the High Court to restrict the benefit of Rs.533/- per day from H 502 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A January, 2020 instead of 10.11.2016. Even otherwise, it is required to be noted that this Court as such delivered in the case of Grah Rakshak (supra) as far back in the month of March, 2015 and a further clarificatory was passed on 04.05.2016. Even thereafter the Director General recommended on 10.11.2016 to pay DCA at Rs.533/- per day which was in consonance with the decision of this Court in the case of B Grah Rakshak (supra) and the subsequent clarificatory dated 04.05.2016. Therefore, the Division Bench of the High Court is not justified in restricting the benefit of the DCA at Rs.533/- per day from January, 2020. However, at the same time considering the fact that there were 17765 Home Guards working and even as observed by the C Commander General / Director General in its recommendation dated 10.11.2016, there will be a financial implication of Rs.51,78,775/- on the Government per day towards payment of DCA at Rs.293/- per day (Rs.533 – Rs.240) and the annual financial implication would come to Rs.189 Crores if they are engaged 365 days a year and taking into consideration such a huge financial burden, we restrict the benefit of D DCA at Rs.533/- per day from the date of filing of the writ petition before the learned Single Judge which would be from 01.06.2018. 8. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the appeals preferred by the State of Orissa are hereby dismissed with the modification as under and the appeals preferred by the original writ E petitioners/Home Guards are partly allowed as under. 9. The and passed by the learned Single Judge confirmed by the Division Bench directing to pay to the Home Guards in the State, DCA at Rs.533/- per day are hereby confirmed. However, it is clarified that the arrears at the rate of Rs.533/- per day shall be paid F from 01.06.2018. The arrears shall be paid within a period of three months from today. It goes without saying that the Home Guards shall be entitled to the periodical rise which may be available to the Police personnel of the State and the DCA to be paid to the Home Guards be periodically increased taking into consideration the minimum of the pay to which the Police personnel of the State are entitled considering periodical increase G from time to time.
