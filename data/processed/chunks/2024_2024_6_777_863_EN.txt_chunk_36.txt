Presently, Section 44AB provides that every person carrying on business, whose total sale, turnover or gross receipts exceed Rs.10 crore, and every person carrying on a profession, if his gross receipts exceed Rs.50 lakhs, in any previous year, is required to get his accounts of such previous year audited by a Chartered Accountant, and obtain before the specified date, a report of the audit in the prescribed form duly signed and verified by such Chartered Accountant. The said provision is popularly called “compulsory tax audits”. The object and purpose of Section 44AB is to prevent evasion of taxes, plug loopholes enabling tax avoidance and also facilitate tax administration, which would ensure that the economic system does not result in concentration of wealth to the common detriment. For immediate reference, Section 44AB of the IT Act, 1961 as it stands presently is extracted as under: “44AB.
