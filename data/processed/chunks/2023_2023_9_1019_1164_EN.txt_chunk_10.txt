Writ Petition no. 11934 of 1995 brings in the next appeal which is C.A. No. 7334 of 2013. The above writ petition was filed by M/s. Keyaram Hotel Pvt. Ltd. The challenge in the said writ petition was to the very same rule. E 5. The case set up in short is as follows. The petitioners are the owners of about 62 grounds. It applied for the sanction of a building plan in the year 1975 for the construction of a hotel. There is reference to an earlier writ petition and contempt proceeding. Suffice it to notice, that planning permission was granted after a delay of 12 years on 08.09.1992. It is their case that it was faced with certain difficulties in the construction. F A revised plan was submitted and building permission was sought for on 17.08.1994 for the construction of a hotel and hotel annexe building etc. which consisted of a basement, ground floor and three further floors. By letter dated 13.09.1994 issued by the second respondent thepetitioner was to gift the open space reserved area to the Commissioner Corporation G of Madras. We may notice further that the third respondent sent communication on 01.12.1994. It is stated inter alia that the structure which existed within the OSR area should be demolished after due sanction and that the OSR land should be free from any structure and be fenced by providing separate entrance from the road side. There is no mention H 1036 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A about the gift deed. The petitioner sought a month’s time to comply with the conditions in letter dated 01.12.1994. However, the respondent insisted on compliance with the requirement of executing a gift deed. In the writ petition, an interim dated 13.03.1996 was passed directing permission after recording undertaking by petitioner to execute gift deed without prejudice to the rights of the petitioner. Petitioner executed gift B deed on 22.05.1996. Petitioner’s revised plan was approved as a group development on 24.04.1999. The grounds urged against the rule appear to be as follows: 1. The rule is an illegal infraction of the petitioner’s right to hold and enjoy the property. C 2. The rule is contrary to the Act and derogatory to the interest of the land owners. 3. The stipulation is violative of the civil right vested in every owner of the property to hold his land and the right to safeguard public interest cannot be stretched to create a D right and title in favour of a local body in the manner contemplated by the respondents 1 and 2.
