11. It is an accepted position and specifi cally recorded in the award that the total value of the contract was Rs. 5,74,35,213.00p. In an earlier paragraph of the award, which has been not reproduced, the learned arbitrator has referred to R.A. Bill No.4 dated 31.08.1993, as per which BEEL had completed work of Rs.1,21,95,859.68p. It is also an accepted and admitted position that as on 30.03.1996, the date on which the work stopped, as per R.A. Bill No. 37, work valued at Rs. 2,92,07,619.13p had been executed. In other words, BEEL had executed and received payments of Rs. 2,92,07,619.13/- from HPCL from time to time, between the period 01.09.1993 and 30.03.1996. Eighty percent of the work was complete. BEEL has received total payment of Rs.4,14,03,478.81p in terms of running account bills till R.A. No. 37. The balance work was Rs. 1,14,87,042.00p. Twenty percent of Rs.1,14,03,478.81 is Rs.22,97,408.40p. In addition, BEEL is entitled to compensation for the delay in execution of the work of Rs.2,92,07,619.13/- till the date payments were made, albeit, the award directs payment of Rs. 18% interest per annum on all claims awarded eff ective from 16.05.1997. 12. The award also reduces the performance bank guarantee amount by 50%, without any discussion, elucidation and reason. 13. In to justify the computation made in the award and also the principle or the method adopted by the arbitral tribunal, BEEL has referred to the Hudson’s formula and relied upon s of this Court in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Company Limited and Others.6, and Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority7, in addition to an earlier decision of this Court in A.T Brij Paul Singh and Others v. State of Gujarat8, and a few s of the High Courts. 6 (2006) 11 SCC 181 (for short, McDermott International Inc.). 7 (2015) 3 SCC 49 (for short, Associate Builders). 8 (1984) 4 SCC 59. 452 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 14. In McDermott International Inc. this Court has referred to various methods of computation of damages in paragraphs 102 to 107. In particular, reference has been made to Hudson’s formula, Emden’s formula, and Eichleay’s formula in the following terms: “Method for computation of damages 102. [Ed. : Para 102 corrected vide Offi cial Corrigendum No. F.3/ Ed.B.J./52/2006 dated 31-7-2006] . What should, however, be the method of computation of damages is a question which now arises for consideration. Before we advert to the rival contentions of the parties in this behalf, we may notice that in M.N. Gangappa v. Atmakur Nagabhushanam Setty & Co. [(1973) 3 SCC 406] this Court held that the method used for computation of damages will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 102-A. In the assessment of damages, the court must consider only strict legal obligations, and not the expectations, however reasonable, of one contractor that the other will do something that he has assumed no legal obligation to do.
