To convict a person under Section 149 IPC prosecution has to establish with the help of evidence that fi rstly, appellants shared a common object and were part of unlawful assembly and secondly, it had to prove that they were aware of the off ences likely to be committed is to achieve the said common object. Both these ingredients are conspicuously absent and there is no evidence to connect the petitioners with the deceased or the co-accused. Undisputedly, no overt act has been attributed to the appellants, and in unequivocal terms PW-9 admits in his cross-examination that none of the accused except Pawan had caused injury to the deceased and there was only a single shot fi red from the pistol. Hence, we are of the considered view that the prosecution had failed to prove the guilt of the appellants herein beyond reasonable doubt, and non-consideration of the lacuna in the prosecution case in proper perspective by the Trial Court and the High Court as analysed hereinabove has resulted in miscarriage in the administration of justice namely conviction of the appellants which cannot be sustained.
