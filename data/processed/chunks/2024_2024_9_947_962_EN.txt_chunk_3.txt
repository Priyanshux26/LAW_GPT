1 to act on behalf of his sisters was based on an unregistered General Power of Attorney (GPA) dated 30.12.1982. However, this GPA was limited in scope, primarily authorizing Defendant No. 1 to manage certain aspects of the property, such as collecting rent. Moreover, the GPA was effectively revoked by a registered partition deed dated 17.02.1988, wherein the co-owners partitioned the property and specifically limited Defendant No. 1’s authority to collection of rent, with no mention of any power to sell the property on behalf of the sisters. 952 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 2.6 In fulfilment of the prior oral agreement dated 14.04.1993, and after ensuring the participation and consent of all co-owners, Defendant No. 1, late Soumendra, and Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 executed a registered sale deed on 27.09.1993 in favor of the appellants (Defendant Nos. 9 to 11) for a consideration of ₹4,20,000. The appellants who are bona fide purchasers, acted in good faith and completed the transaction with all the five rightful owners, and accordingly acquired valid title to the property. 2.7 The plaintiffs (Respondent Nos. 1 & 2), despite being aware of the necessity of obtaining consent from Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 and the limitations of Defendant No. 1’s authority, filed T.S. No. 103 of 1994 before the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Baripada. They sought specific performance of the alleged agreement dated 06.06.1993 or, in the alternative, specific performance to the extent of the shares of Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra. The plaintiffs, as dealers operating on the suit land, aimed to secure ownership of the property to further their commercial interests. 3. Before the Trial Court, the plaintiffs contended that they had entered into a valid and enforceable agreement to purchase the suit property from Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra on 06.06.1993 for a total consideration of ₹5,70,000, paying ₹70,000 as earnest money. They asserted that Defendant No. 1 was authorized to act on behalf of Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 by virtue of the General Power of Attorney dated 30.12.1982 (Ext.1), which empowered him to sell the property. The plaintiffs emphasized that the agreement stipulated the sisters (Defendant Nos. 6 to 8) would come to Baripada within three months to execute the sale deed, and they were assured by Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra that the sisters had consented to the sale. They maintained that they were always ready and willing to perform their part of the contract, including paying the balance consideration and completing the sale. Furthermore, they argued that the subsequent sale deed executed on 27.09.1993 in favour of Defendant Nos. 9 to 11 was invalid and not binding on them, as it was executed with full knowledge of the prior agreement with the plaintiffs. 4. The defendants, in their respective written statements, refuted the plaintiffs’ claims. They contended that Defendant No. 1 did not have [2024] 9 S.C.R. 953 Janardan Das & Ors. v. Durga Prasad Agarwalla & Ors. the authority to sell the property on behalf of Defendant Nos.
