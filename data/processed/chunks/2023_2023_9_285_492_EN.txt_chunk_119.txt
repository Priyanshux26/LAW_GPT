In Principles of Statutory Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh37 on the use of the word “shall” and presumption of the word being imperative, it is stated: “ ….this prima facie inference about the provision being imperative may be rebutted by other considerations flowing from such D construction. There are numerous cases where the word “shall” has therefore been construed as merely directory. The word ‘shall’, observes HIDAYATULLAH, J. “is ordinarily mandatory but sometimes not so interpreted if the context or the intention otherwise demands and points out SUBBARAO J. “when a statute uses E the word ‘shall’, prima facie it is mandatory, but the court may ascertain the real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute.” [emphasis supplied] 32.1. P.B. Maxwell in the Commentary on Interpretation of F Statutes38 notes that an Act is to be regarded in its entirety and discusses the following three ways of interpretation: “Passing from the external aspects of the Statute to its contents, it is an elementary rule that construction is to be made of all parts together, and not of one part only by itself” G 36 Gulzari Lal Malwari v Ram Gopal AIR 1937 Cal 765; Mattegunta Dhanalakshmi v Kantam Raju Saradamba, AIR 1977 AP 348; See also Puranchandra v Kallipada Roy, AIR 1942 Cal 386;Boottam Pitchiah v Boyapati Koteswara Rao AIR 1964 AP 519 37 Justice G.P.

[HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] i) Individual words are not considered in isolation, but A may be have their meaning determined by other words in the Section in which they occur. ii) The meaning of a section may be controlled by other individual sections in the same Act. B iii) Lastly, the meaning of a section may be determined, not so much by reference to other individual provisions of the Statute, as by the scheme of the Act regarded in general” [emphasis supplied] C 32.2. Justice G.P. Singh in Interpretation of Statutes further notes39: “ The principle that the statute must be read as a whole is equally applicable to different parts of the same section. The section must be construed as a whole whether or not one of the parts is a D saving clause or a proviso. Subbarao J calls it “an elementary rule that construction of a section is to be made of all the parts together” [emphasis supplied] 32.3. Thus, on a consolidated reading of Section 35,36 and the proviso to Section 35 and 42 ; the use of the word “acted upon” in all E these sections or even in the same section, read with the objective and legislative intent of the Stamp Act 1899, it is clear that the bar under Section 35 is not intended to be absolute; non-payment of stamp duty is a curable defect as the objective is to protect revenue.
