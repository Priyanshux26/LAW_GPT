Etc. v. Nithu & Ors. Etc. 4. The appellant-Society took a specific plea, both in the writ petitions as also before the Appellate Court that it is Cooperative Society and not a State or any other authority, as contemplated under Article 12 of the Constitution of India and therefore, is not amenable to judicial review. On merits, it was submitted that the in Umadevi (supra) cannot have any application to the facts of the instant case for the reason that the respondents-writ petitioners were not irregular appointees but appointed illegally and therefore, not entitled for regularization. 5. We may note that the respondents-writ petitioners were appointed temporarily on a daily wage basis in terms of the Circulars dated 15th December, 1992 and 10th December, 2010 which stated in clear terms that their appointments were made on a temporary basis and on daily wages on the recommendations by the members of the Society.
