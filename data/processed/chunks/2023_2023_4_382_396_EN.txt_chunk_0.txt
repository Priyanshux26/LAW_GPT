As per Section 271C(1)(a), if any person fails to deduct the whole or any part of the tax as required by or under the provisions of Chapter XVIIB B then such a person shall be liable to pay by way of penalty a sum equal to the amount of tax which such person failed to deduct or pay as aforesaid. So far as failure to pay the whole or any part of the tax is concerned, the same would be with respect to Section 271C(1)(b) which is not the case here. Therefore, Section C 271C(1)(a) shall be applicable in case of a failure on the part of the concerned person/assessee to “deduct” the whole or any part of the tax as required by or under the provisions of Chapter XVIIB.
