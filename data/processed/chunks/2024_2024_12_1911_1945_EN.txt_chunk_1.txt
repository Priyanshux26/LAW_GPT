[Paras 52, 53-57] Partition – Perfect or imperfect: Held: Partition is either perfect or imperfect – Perfect partition means division of a revenue paying estate into two or more such [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1913 Abdul Rejak Laskar v. Mafizur Rahman & Ors. estates each separately liable for revenue assessed thereon – Imperfect partition means the division of a revenue paying estate into two or more portions jointly liable for the revenue assessed thereon entire estate. [Para 23] Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886 – Chapter VI, s.100 – Perfect partition and imperfect partition: Held: Chapter VI of the Regulation, 1886 deals with the procedure for carrying out “perfect partition” and “imperfect partition” of a revenue paying estate on the basis of an application made before the Deputy Commissioner – Section 100 of the Regulation, 1886, however, provides that when there is objection as regards the question of title, the Deputy Commissioner will stay his hand in the matter and such objection would be determined by a civil court of competent jurisdiction. [Para 24] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – s.4 – When CPC is in conflict with Special or Local law: Held: The plain reading of the said provision would indicate that when anything in the CPC is in conflict with anything in the special or local law or with any special jurisdiction or power conferred or in the special form of procedure prescribed by or under any other law, the Code will not (in the absence of any specific provision to the contrary) prevail so as to override such inconsistent provisions – When there is no conflict between the special or local law and the Code, the Code will apply. [Para 34] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – s.9 – Jurisdiction of Civil Court: Held: Section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 provides that whenever a question arises before the civil court whether its jurisdiction is excluded expressly or by necessary implication, the Court naturally feels inclined to consider whether the remedy afforded by an alternative provision prescribed by any special statute is sufficient or adequate – In cases where exclusion of the civil court's jurisdiction is expressly provided for, the consideration as to the scheme of the statute in question and the adequacy or sufficiency of the remedy provided for by it may be relevant but cannot be decisive – Where exclusion is pleaded as a matter of necessary implication such consideration would be very important 1914 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports and in conceivable circumstances might become even decisive. [Para 29] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – s.54 – Partition of estate or separation of share: Held: The plain reading of the s.54 would indicate that the same deals with a case in which a civil court can pass a decree but cannot itself execute it – The execution has to be effected by the Collector – Civil courts have under this Section, jurisdiction to try and decide suits for partition or separate possession of share of estates assessed to payment of revenue to Government but have no power to execute decree passed in such suits – The decree that may be passed by the civil court would declare the rights of the several parties interested in the property, but the decree should direct the actual partition to be made by the Collector or any officer subordinate to him authorized on that behalf.
