1141 [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] 5. From the above, it is clear that the learned single judge has A taken the view that, by virtue of the earlier dated 06.07.2022 passed by this Court, he is unable to properly adjudicate the matters. However, a perusal of the dated 06.07.2022 indicates no such restriction on the power or discretion of the High Court. B 6. 1Taking into consideration the above, we are of the considered view that it would be appropriate to remand this issue to the High Court for reconsideration, without being influenced by any of the s passed by this Court either in the present Special Leave Petitions or in Special Leave Petition (C) No. 11237 of 2022, C Special Leave Petition (C) No.11578 of 2022 and Special Leave Petition (C) No. 11579 of 2022 respectively. 7. We request the High Court to dispose of the said matters, pending adjudication before it,expeditiously and preferablywithin a period of two weeks reckoned from the date of communication D of a copy of this . 8. Till the High Court hears the matters, status-quo as it exists today shall be maintained by the parties. 9. Before parting with these matters, we make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. It is E further clarified that the status-quo being granted today, shall not be construed as an expression of any opinion by this Court on the merits of the case. The High Court shall deal with, and decide, the matters on their own merits in accordance with law. F 10.The Special Leave Petitions and all the pending applications are disposed of on the above terms.” 12. Thereafter, the learned Single Judge of the High Court took up for consideration the said interim relief applications inCS Nos. 118 of 2022 and 119 of 2022 and proceeded to decide the same by his G dated 17.08.2022. Therein, the learned Single Judge formulated the points for determination in the following words: - “(1) Whether the plaintiff have locus to maintain the suit?

A (3) In whose favour the prima facie case and balance of convenience lie?” 12.1. The learned Single Judge examined the facts of the case, byelaws of the party as also a Division Bench decision of the High Court concerning the same political party in S. Thirunavukkarasu and B Anr. v. Selvi J. Jayalalitha and Anr. : 1997 (III) CTC 229 and observed, inter alia, that if anything was done contrary to the party constitution and was likely to cause injury to the rights of the members, there was no bar to seek redressal from the Civil Court. The learned Single Judge also observed that the principle of indoor management would apply only in respect of deliberations in the meeting convened in C accordance with byelaws and if the process of convening the meeting itself was faulty and contrary to law, there was no bar under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 to approach the Civil Court.
