Case Arising From EXTRA-ORDINARY APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 3056 of 2023 From the and dated 22.07.2022 of the High Court of Karnataka at Kalaburagi in CRP No. 200017 of 2022 Appearances for Parties C. Nageswara Rao, Sr. Adv., Vikram Hegde, Chitwan Sharma, Advs. for the Petitioners. Ameet Deshpande, Sr. Adv., Akshat Shrivastava, Satvic Mathur, Advs. for the Respondent. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 231 Choudappa & Anr. v. Choudappa since Deceased by Lrs. & Ors. / of the Supreme Court Heard learned senior counsel for the parties. The challenge in the present special leave petition is to the revisional dated 22nd July, 2022 passed by the High Court dismissing the revision of the petitioners arising from the rejection of their application alleged to have been filed under VII Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short, ‘C.P.C.’). A suit for recovery of possession and for correction of mutation entries was filed by the respondents in the year, 1963 and it was decreed on 12.07.1973. The said , and decree specifically directs for holding an inquiry regarding mesne profits from the date of the suit i.e., 24.09.1963 in accordance with XX Rule 12, C.P.C. The aforesaid , and decree of the Court of first instance attained finality with the dismissal of the appeal filed by the petitioners in the year, 1980. The respondents applied for the execution so as to obtain possession of the suit land sometime in the year, 1993 and after going through the entire exercise of execution, issuance of warrant for possession, the respondents were put into possession of the suit land property in the year, 2005. It appears that sometime in 2014, an application purported to be under Section 141 C.P.C. or under XX Rule 12 C.P.C. was filed by the respondents for the determination of the mesne profits as directed by the , and decree dated 12.07.1973. Once such an application was filed, the petitioners moved application under VII Rule 11(d) C.P.C. contending that such an application is hopelessly barred by limitation and as such, it should be rejected outright. The aforesaid application filed under VII Rule 11(d) C.P.C. was rejected by the Trial Court and the revision thereof also met the same fate at the hands of the High Court. Thus, the Special Leave Petition. Learned counsel for the petitioners has argued that the application allegedly moved by the respondents for an inquiry for mesne profits is in the nature of a second execution and since, it has been filed 232 [2024] 9 S.C.R.
