Kavita Saraff and Another (Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) No. 5583 of 2022) 09 April 2024 [Aniruddha Bose* and Sanjay Kumar, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Issue arose as to whether the cheques were issued in discharge of a debt and if so, whether the respondent no.1 was able to rebut the presumption in terms of s. 118/139 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881. Headnotes Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 – ss. 118/139 – Dishonour of cheque – Sum involved therein, if advanced in discharge of a legally enforceable debt – Raising of presumption u/s. 139 – Complaint by partnership firm alleging dishonour of cheques issued by the respondent no. 1 on the ground of insufficiency of funds – Case of partnership firm that it had granted financial assistance to the respondent no.1 and the said cheques were issued in discharge of her liability – Respondent no.1’s case that money was advanced to the respondent no.1 for undertaking stock market related transactions through her account – Trial court convicted the respondent no. 1 u/s. 138 since she failed to rebut the presumption – However, the first appellate court acquitted the respondent no. 1 holding that she rebutted the presumption – High Court upheld the same – Interference with: Held: Not called for – As regards the sum involved in the cheques advanced in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or not, the complainant failed to show if any sum was advanced towards financial assistance – High Court found that the debt/liability, in discharge of which, according to the complainant, the cheques were issued, did not reflect in the complainant’s balance-sheet – Other partners of the firm did not depose as prosecution witnesses to establish that the cheque-amounts were advanced to the respondent no. 1 as financial assistance – Respondent * Author 256 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports no. 1 has put up a plausible defence as regards the reason for which the complainant’s funds had come to her account – Both the appellate fora, on going through the evidence did not find existence of any “enforceable debt or other liability” – Thus, it cannot be held that the findings of the High Court and the first appellate court were perverse, or based on no evidence.
