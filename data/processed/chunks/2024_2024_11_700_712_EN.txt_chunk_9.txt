Considering that it is a single seat and since the fee will be spread over for a period of five years, the financial impact on whom the burden will fall will be marginal, in proportion to the total fee payable. On the current facts, we find that this is the best possible option, to neutralize the effect of the interim s which have operated to the prejudice of the colleges. 33. In view of what has been discussed hereinabove, we partly allow the appeals and direct that the appellant colleges will be at liberty to make a representation to the Fee Fixation Committee/Fee Fixation Authority pointing out their grievance, as set out above, and the Fee Fixation Committee/Fee Fixation Authority shall pass appropriate s in terms of the holding rendered in this . 34. The appeals are partly allowed in the above terms. No as to costs. Result of the case: Appeals partly allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
