Act, 1961. Thus, any individual not falling within the said clause would not be entitled to the said exemption. This would however be discriminatory insofar as those settlers in Sikkim are concerned who have been domiciled in Sikkim subsequent to promulgation of 1961 Regulation and till 26th April, 1975 when Sikkim merged with India. Such E individuals are old settlers who have become citizens of India from 26th April, 1975 but who were domiciled in Sikkim prior to the said date. In my view, they are also entitled to the exemption under Section 10 (26AAA). Hence, directions in that regard have to be issued to fill the Legislative vacuum and amendment to the Explanation is necessary. However, those individuals who have been domiciled in Sikkim subsequent F to 26th April, 1975 shall not be entitled to the benefit of exemption from payment of income tax. 77. This Court has on previous occasions, sought to enforce rights of citizens even in areas of legislative vacuum. [For instance, in Vishaka and Ors. vs. State of Rajasthan, A.I.R. 1997 SC 3011]. To this end, G Article 142 of the Constitution of India has been invoked and the law so declared in to fill the vacuum has been treated as law declared by this Court under Article 141 until a proper legislation is made. Hence, it has to be directed that till such amendment is made to the down the Explanation to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961, H 366 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A all individuals domiciled in Sikkim up to 26th April, 1975 shall be entitled to the exemption under the said provision from the current financial year i.e., 1st April, 2022 onwards. This direction is being issued in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution so as to eliminate discrimination and disparity in respect of the aforesaid category of Sikkimese, who subsequently have become citizens of India w.e.f. 26th B April, 1975 and to save the Explanation from being rendered unconstitutional vis-à-vis such individuals who form a small percentage of Sikkimese and who are also entitled to such an exemption. Such as approach is being adopted rather than striking down the Explanation to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 which would have the effect C of withdrawing the benefit of exemption even from those categories of persons who are presently eligible for the same. 78. Hence, until the amendment is made, the following clause shall be read as a part of the Explanation to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961, possibly as sub-clause (iv) thereof: D “(iv) any other individual, whose name does not appear in the Register of Sikkim Subjects but it is established that such individual was domiciled in Sikkim on or before 26th April, 1975.” This provision would extend the benefit of exemption to those individuals, domiciled in Sikkim on the day it merged with India, i.e., 26th E April, 1975. 79. In the result, the writ petitions are disposed of in the following terms: i) That the benefit of income-tax exemption presently is restricted only to those Sikkimese who fall within the three F clauses of the Explanation to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T.
