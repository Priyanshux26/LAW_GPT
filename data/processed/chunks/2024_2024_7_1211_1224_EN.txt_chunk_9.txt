The nowhere lays down that directors or authorised signatories would come under the ambit of ‘drawer’ for the purposes of Section 143A. The appellants’ interpretation conflates the roles of authorized signatories and drawers, which are distinct under the NI Act. Appellants have relied upon a single paragraph, which does not 11 [2012] 5 SCR 503 : (2012) 5 SCC 661 1224 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports form part of the ratio therein, to substantiate their argument. But in this relied upon paragraph, the Court only made an observation that the authorised signatory becomes a drawer for the company, for the limited purpose of extending the criminal liability as per Section 141. 34. The respondents correctly argued that an authorized signatory is not a drawer of the cheque, as established in N. Harihara Krishnan (Supra).12 This clarified that a signatory is merely authorized to sign on behalf of the company and does not become the drawer. The respondents’ interpretation aligns with the principle that penal statutes should be interpreted strictly, particularly in determining vicarious liability. The in K.K. Ahuja (Supra),13 further supports this approach, emphasizing that penal provisions must be read strictly to determine liability. 35. In conclusion, the High Court’s decision to interpret ‘drawer’ strictly as the issuer of the cheque, excluding authorized signatories, is well-founded. This interpretation aligns with the legislative intent, established legal precedents, and principles of statutory interpretation. The primary liability for an offence under Section 138 lies with the company, and the company’s management is vicariously liable only under specific conditions provided in Section 141. The appellants’ submissions are thus rejected, and the High Court’s is upheld. This decision maintains the clarity and consistency of the law regarding cheque dishonour cases, ensuring that liability is appropriately assigned to the responsible parties under the NI Act. Therefore, the question of law put before this Court is answered in the negative. 36. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan 12 [2017] 9 SCR 324 : (2018) 13 SCC 663 13 [2009] 9 SCR 1144 : (2009) 10 SCC 48
