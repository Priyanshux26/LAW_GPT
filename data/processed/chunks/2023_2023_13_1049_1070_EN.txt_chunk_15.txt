Therefore, in this case, the scheduled offence does not exist at all. Hence, the appellant cannot be prosecuted for the offences punishable under Section 3 of the PMLA. CONCLUSIONS 27. While we reject the fi rst and second submissions canvassed by the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, the third submission must be upheld. Our conclusions are: a. It is not necessary that a person against whom the off ence under Section 3 of the PMLA is alleged, must have been shown as the accused in the scheduled off ence; 107 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. b. Even if an accused shown in the complaint under the PMLA is not an accused in the scheduled off ence, he will benefi t from the acquittal of all the accused in the scheduled off ence or discharge of all the accused in the scheduled off ence. Similarly, he will get the benefi t of the of quashing the proceedings of the scheduled off ence; c. The fi rst property cannot be said to have any connection with the proceeds of the crime as the acts constituting scheduled off ence were committed after the property was acquired; d. The issue of whether the appellant has used tainted money forming part of the proceeds of crime for acquiring the second property can be decided only at the time of trial; and e. The off ence punishable under Section 120-B of the IPC will become a scheduled off ence only if the conspiracy alleged is of committing an off ence which is specifi cally included in the Schedule. 28. Accordingly, the impugned dated 27th September 2022 is, hereby, quashed and set aside, and the complaint being Special C.C no.781 of 2022 pending before the Special Court for PMLA cases, Bengaluru is, hereby, quashed only insofar as the present appellant is concerned. 29. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Divya Pandey
