Even if this Court proceeds on the basis that legislature is best suited branch of the State to determine if particular animal-sports are part of cultural tradition of a region or community, or not, if such cultural event or tradition offends G the law, the penal consequence would follow. Such activities cannot be justified on the ground of being part of cultural tradition of a State. In A. Nagaraja, the sports were held to attract the restriction of Sections 3 and 11(1)(a) and (m) of the 1960 Act because of the manner it was practiced. The Amendment Act read with the Rules H 434 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A seek to substantially minimise the pain and suffering and continue with the traditional sports. The Amendment having received Presidential assent, this Court does not think there is any flaw in the State action. “Jallikattu” as bovine sports have to be isolated from the manner in which they were earlier practiced and organising the sports itself would be permissible, in terms of the B Tamil Nadu Rules. (iii) The Tamil Nadu Amendment Act is not in pith and substance, to ensure survival and well-being of the native breeds of bulls. The said Act is also not relatable to Article 48 of the Constitution of India. Incidental impact of the said Amendment C Act may fall upon the breed of a particular type of bulls and affect agricultural activities, but in pith and substance the Act is relatable to Entry 17 of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. (iv) Answer to this question is in the negative. The Tamil D Nadu Amendment Act does not go contrary to the Articles 51-A (g) and 51-A(h) and it does not violate the provisions of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. (v) The Tamil Nadu Amendment Act read along with the Rules framed in that behalf is not directly contrary to the ratio of E the in the case of A. Nagaraja and of this Court delivered on 16th November 2016 dismissing the plea for Review of the A. Nagaraja as this Court is of the opinion that the defects pointed out in the aforesaid two s have been overcome by the State Amendment Act read with the Rules made in that behalf. [Para 40][473-B-H] F 9.
