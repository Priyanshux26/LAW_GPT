Digital Supreme Court Reports view that on its own merits, the Second Impugned cannot be faulted. However, for such legal misadventure resulting in wastage of precious judicial time of the High Court, which could have been better spent answering the call of justice raised by the teeming millions, we impose costs of Rs.1,20,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Twenty Thousand) on the appellant. Such cost shall be deposited within 6 weeks with the Registry of the High Court, to be utilised as follows: i. Rs.40,000 for juvenile welfare in a manner to be decided by the Juvenile Justice Monitoring Committee; ii. Rs.40,000 for welfare of the Advocate-Clerks in a manner to be decided by Hon’ble the Acting Chief Justice, and; iii. Rs.40,000 for legal aid in a manner to be decided by the High Court Legal Services Committee. Receipt of deposit be filed in the Registry of this Court soon thereafter. In case of non-compliance, the matter will be placed before us with appropriate Office Report. 33. Accordingly, both Impugned s stand set aside. The dated 01.04.2010 passed by the Single Judge stands restored with a slight modification i.e., reduction in the rate of interest which has been claimed by and allowed to the appellant. Interest at the rate of 36% p.a. is on the excessive side and we pare down the same to 12% p.a. in the interest of justice. Hence, simple interest will run only @ 12% p.a. from 24.06.2000 till the date of realisation. 34. The appeals are allowed in the above terms. 35. I.A. No.16204/2019 for exemption from filing Certified Copy of the Impugned (s) is allowed. I.A. No.180367/2019 for permission to file Additional Documents is allowed. 36. I.A. No.16203/2019 seeks condonation of delay in filing the petitions. There is a delay of 589 days in filing the petition against the First Impugned . The petition against the Second Impugned is also delayed by approximately 84 days. We are cognizant that the appellant had moved the Division Bench seeking a fresh hearing of the main appeal, which led to passing of the Second Impugned . In Collector, Land Acquisition, Anantnag v Mst Katiji (1987) 2 SCC 107, the Court noted that it had been adopting a justifiably liberal approach in condoning delay and that “justice on [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1023 A.B. Govardhan v. P. Ragothaman merits” is to be preferred as against what “scuttles a decision on merits”. Albeit, while reversing an of the High Court therein condoning delay, principles to guide the consideration of an application for condonation of delay were culled out in Esha Bhattacharjee v Managing Committee of Raghunathpur Nafar Academy (2013) 12 SCC 649. One of the factors taken note of therein was that substantial justice is paramount.8 37. In N L Abhyankar v Union of India (1995) 1 MhLJ 503, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court at Nagpur considered, though in the context of delay vis-à-vis Article 226 of the Constitution, the decision in M/s Dehri Rohtas Light Railway Company Limited v District Board, Bhojpur (1992) 2 SCC 598, and held that “The real test for sound exercise of discretion by the High Court in this regard is not the physical running of time as such, but the test is whether by reason of delay there is such negligence on the part of the petitioner, so as to infer that he has given up his claim or whether before the petitioner has moved the Writ Court, the rights of the third parties have come into being which should not be allowed to be disturbed unless there is reasonable explanation for the delay.”9 The Bombay High Court’s eloquent statement of the correct position in law found approval in Municipal Council, Ahmednagar v Shah Hyder Beig (2000) 2 SCC 48 and Mool Chandra v Union of India, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1878.
