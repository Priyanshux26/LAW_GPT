According to her, the dogs were used in the evening after the body was taken out from the well in the afternoon. Thereafter, she said that the tracking dogs had gone to the well and washing area at 7-8 o’clock but she did not remember on which dateit was,but it was after the body was found. Similarly, Jitendra Singh (PW-8), a close relation of PW-1 and a key witness to the prosecution’s seizure memos, stated that he had heard of sniff er dogs being used between 28.03.2013 and 29.03.2013 but it was not in his presence. As to why sniff er/tracking dogs RAJESH & ANR. v. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH 13 [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] would be pressed into service after the police found the dead body, the murder weapon and other material objects is not comprehensible. Notably, the Investigating Offi cer (PW-16) did not even mention the use of sniff er/ tracking dogs during investigation. This suppression, be it for whatever reason, does not refl ect well upon the prosecution. 18. These being glaring disparities in the very foundation of the case, things get progressively worse.Saidutt Bohare (PW-15), the Nodal Offi cer from Bharti Airtel Limited, who furnished the call data to the police, said that he sent those details by email to the Police Superintendent’s Offi ce when he was asked. He produced a copy of the email, containing the call details sent to the Police Superintendent’s offi ce (Ex. P31). He stated that the subscriber of mobile number 9993135127 was Om Prakash, son of Buletan Yadav, and furnished the call details and IMEI data. The call data statement (Ex. P31) reveals that it was made available to the police at 18:05 hours on 28.03.2013. It was only thereafter that the FIR was registered at 18:20 hours. However, though the call data statement was suffi cient to link Om Prakash Yadav with the ransom calls, the police chose to mention in the FIR that the accused was ‘Unknown’. Further, if Ex. P31 statement pointed to the involvement of Om Prakash Yadav, as claimed by the Investigating Offi cer (PW-16), there is no explanation forthcoming as to why the police picked up Rajesh Yadav fi rst. 19. Further, and most crucial of all, there is no clarity as to when the appellants were actually taken into ‘custody’ by the police. PW-2 stated in his examination-in-chief that the police caught Rajesh Yadav and took him to Gorakhpur Police Station during the afternoon hours of 28.03.2013 itself. During his cross-examination, PW-2 again asserted that the police did not take Om Prakash Yadav on 28.03.2013 but they took Rajesh Yadav and Raja Yadav. PW-2 categorically denied the suggestion that the police did not take Raja Yadav and Rajesh Yadav on 28.03.2013 and that they took them on 29.03.2013. Shiv Prakash (PW-4), a relation of the accused, also stated that the Gorakhpur police had taken him along with Raja Yadav, Brijesh Yadav, Om Prakash Yadav and Rajesh Yadav and held them in the police station on the night of 28.03.2013 itself, where they were beaten.
