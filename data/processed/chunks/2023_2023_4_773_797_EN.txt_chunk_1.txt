In view of dismissal of E the special leave petition qua PNB by the dated 8th April, 2011, the and outlawing section 16-B of the HPGST Act can be examined. [Paras 29, 31 and 32][788-G-H; 789- E-G] A.R. Antulay vs. R.S. Nayak (1988) 2 SCC 602 : [1988] 1 Suppl. SCR 1– referred to. F 1.2 Since the writ petition had been rendered infructuous on the date it was decided, it was not necessary for the High Court to pronounce on the validity of section 16-B. A decision on the constitutional validity of a provision should be invited not in vacuum but when the justice of the case demands such a decision. G Hence, it is held that the decision on an infructuous writ petition is inconsequential and can never be of any effect. The issue as to whether section 16-B of the HPGST Act is ultra vires any provision of law including the supreme law of the country is no longer res integra. What appears to be of significance in the light H STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH v. M/S A.J. 775 INFRASTRUCTURES PVT. LTD of the decision in Central Bank of India is that the findings in the A s and s disposing of the writ petitions impugned in two of the four civil appeals ~ the first dated 7th September, 2007 and the other dated 2nd January, 2008 ~ with regard to the scope, ambit and applicability of section 35 of the SARFAESI Act, more particularly the latter holding section 16-B of the B HPGST Act as ultra vires the Constitution and the Banking Companies Act, loses its basis and can no longer be held to be legal and valid. Section 35 of the SARFAESI Act could not have been construed as conferring any right on a secured creditor to claim priority over dues of the State in the absence of a provision in that behalf which presently can now be claimed, subject to other C conditions being fulfilled, in view of section 26E of the SARFAESI Act. Pertinently, the High Court while seized of the writ petition of PNB was not at all concerned with the SARFAESI Act as such. The matter had travelled to the High Court from proceedings under the DRT Act. There was, thus, no occasion for the High D Court to pronounce on the validity of section 16-B of the HPGST Act based on what was held by its coordinate Bench in M/s A.J. Infrastructures Pvt. Ltd.. The High Courtwas therefore in clear error.Section 16-B of the HPGST Act is a perfectly valid piece of legislation and is not ultra vires the Constitution and/or the Banking Companies Act as erroneously held in the decision of E the High Court dated 2nd January, 2008. Also, following the decision in Central Bank of India, any observation in the decision dated 7th September, 2007 touching upon section 16-B of the HPGST Act vis-à-vis section 35 of the SARFAESI Act is of no effect.
