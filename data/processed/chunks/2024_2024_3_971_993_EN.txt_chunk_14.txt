He is held to have duly complied with the disclosure obligation and no bias or improper conduct can be attributed to rendition of the Award dated 27.09.2014 by Mr. Lau, as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 991 Avitel Post Studioz Limited & Ors. v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Limited (Previously Named Hpeif Holdings 1 Limited) 38. Another point on the above aspect i.e. the timing of the communication would also need our attention. The communication by Ms. Pauline was made in the year 2016, much after the final Award was rendered on 27.09.2014. When the explanation of Mr. Christopher Lau in his communication dated 26.04.2016 is examined in the context of the roving query made by the third party, well beyond the Award, we have no hesitation to hold that there was no disability on the part of Mr. Lau to conduct the arbitral proceedings between the appellants and the respondent. 39. We, therefore, conclude that there is no bias factor operating against Mr. Lau that would violate the most basic notions of morality and justice or shock the conscience of the Court. Onerous Travails 40. This case has unfortunately seen a protracted and arduous battle to enforce an award for over 10 long years, with multiple phases of litigation. The arbitration itself commenced in Singapore on 11.05.2012, when notice of arbitration was issued by the respondent. Then the SIAC Emergency Awards were rendered on 28.05.2012 and 29.05.2012. Proceedings were then initiated by the award holder under S. 9 of Indian Arbitration Act at the Bombay High Court, seeking deposit of security amount to the extent of their claims. In the meanwhile, the award debtors’ objections on the grounds of jurisdiction were dismissed by the arbitral tribunal through a Final Partial Award on 17.12.2012. In the Section 9 proceedings, the appellants were directed to deposit a certain sum for enforcement of the award. The award debtor challenged the same before the Supreme Court, which was subsequently dismissed and culminated in an to maintain the specified amount in the award debtor’s account. However, the award debtors’ failure to maintain their account to the ed extent, led to the contempt proceedings before the Supreme Court, which were disposed of vide s dated 02.09.2022 & 09.09.2022. 41. Meanwhile, the Final Award was issued on 27.09.2014, which was sought to be set aside by the award-debtor through an application under 34 of the Indian Arbitration Act before the High Court. The same was dismissed as not maintainable on 28.09.2015. An appeal against the same was filed & dismissed subsequently. Simultaneously the award holder sought to enforce the award through an Arbitration Petition before the High Court. As a result, the enforcement 992 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports proceedings culminated in the impugned s dated 25.04.2023 of the High Court whereby the final award was rendered enforceable. 42. This long list of events points to a saga of the award-holder’s protracted and arduous struggle to gather the fruits of the Award.
