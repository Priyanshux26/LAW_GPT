Union of India & Ors. ensure that they can flourish in an environment of equality, respect, and dignity, without being subjected to caste-based discrimination which stifles their personal growth – When caste prejudices manifest in institutional settings, such as prisons, they create further restrictions on the personal development and reformation of individuals from marginalized communities – When Prison Manuals restrict the reformation of prisoners from marginalized communities, they violate their right to life – When prisoners from marginalized communities are subjected to discriminatory practices based on caste, their inherent dignity is violated – Thus, the impugned provisions violative of Art.21 – Constitution of India – Art.21. [Paras 185-188, 196] Prisons – Prison Manuals – Plea that provisions as regards caste-based division of labour/work, forced labour and violative of Art.23: Held: Persons from specific communities performing honourable tasks, while those from marginalized communities are forced into undesirable work leads to unfair distribution of labour within the prison system – It perpetuates the idea that some individuals are inherently suited to low-status labour based solely on their birth, reinforcing deep-rooted caste inequalities – Imposing labour or work, which is considered impure or low-grade like cleaning latrines and sweeping work, upon members of marginalized communities amounts to forced labour u/Art.23 – Forced to undertake the menial tasks simply because of their caste background robs prisoners of the element of choice that other prisoners enjoy and constitutes form of coercion – Art.23 was incorporated to protect the members of oppressed castes from exploitative practices, where their labour is taken advantage of, and without any adequate return – However, prison rules, by exploiting labour of the oppressed castes, perpetuate the same injustice to guard against which Art.23 was inserted – Assigning labour based on caste background strips individuals of their liberty to engage in meaningful work, and denies them the opportunity to rise above the constraints imposed by their social identity – Thus, impugned provisions violative of Art.23 – Constitution of India – Art.23.
