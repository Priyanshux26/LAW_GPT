Section 4 is a deeming provision.46 It deems that a party has waived its right to object if it proceeds with the arbitration without stating its objection to non-compliance of any provisions from which the parties may derogate or of any requirement under the arbitration 39 Section 21, Arbitration Act 40 Section 22, Arbitration Act 41 Section 24, Arbitration Act 42 Section 25, Arbitration Act 43 Section 26, Arbitration Act 44 Section 29, Arbitration Act 45 Section 2(2), Arbitration Act 46 Shree Subhlaxmi Fabrics (P) Ltd. v.

M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company agreement.47 Importantly, Section 4 distinguishes between derogable (non-mandatory) and mandatory provisions.48 28. Section 4 is based on Article 4 of the Model Law.49 The purpose of incorporating Section 4 is to inform the arbitrators of the principle of waiver.50 Peter Binder suggests that Article 4 aims to prohibit the adoption of delay tactics by parties and contribute to the fluency of the proceedings.51 A party to arbitration has a right to object to any non-compliance with procedural requirements. Section 4 implies a waiver of this right under certain conditions based on the principle of waiver or estoppel.52 The procedural default at issue must be stipulated either in the arbitration agreement or a non-mandatory provision under Part I of the Arbitration Act. If the arbitration agreement is silent on a procedural point, the provisions of the Arbitration Act take effect. According to Section 4, a party cannot insist on compliance with non-mandatory provisions of the Arbitration Act if it fails to make a timely objection.53 Section 4 of the Arbitration Act necessarily implies that parties cannot proceed with arbitration in derogation of a mandatory provision. 29. The initial draft of Article 4 of the Model Law did not make an exception for mandatory provisions. Therefore, suggestions were made to “soften” the provision by limiting “the waiver rule to non-compliance with non-mandatory provisions.”54 Further, a proposal was also made to include a list of mandatory provisions under the Model Law. It was suggested that such a list “would make it unnecessary to include in 47 BSNL v. Motorola India (P) Ltd. (2002) SCC 337. [“39. Pursuance to Section 4 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, a party which knows that a requirement under the arbitration agreement has not been complied with and still proceeds with the arbitration without raising an objection, as soon as possible, waived their right to object.”] 48 A/CN.9/246 (44) 49 Article 4, Model Law [It reads: “A party who knows that any provision of this Law from which the parties may derogate or any requirement under the arbitration agreement has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating his objection to such non-compliance without undue delay or, if a time-limit is provided therefor, within such period of time, shall be deemed to have waived his right to object.”] 50 Howard Holtzmann and Joseph Neuhaus, A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 196 51 Peter Binder, International Commercial Arbitration and Conciliation in UNCITRAL Model Law Jurisdiction (2nd edn, 2005) 49 52 A/CN.9/264 (17) 53 Howard Holtzmann and Joseph Neuhaus, A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (Kluwer Law) 197 54 A/CN.9/245 [178] 2210 [2024] 11 S.C.R.
