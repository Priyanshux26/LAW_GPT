The documents undoubtedly G need to include the essential documents necessary to properly appreciate the appeal on its merits. Even the depositions of the witnesses, both 16 1986 SCC OnLine All 211 17 1999 SCC OnLine All 1348 18 1999 SCC OnLine All 1392 H 19 2001 SCC OnLine All 864 JITENDRA KUMAR RODE v. UNION OF INDIA 527 [SANJAY KAROL, J.] prosecution and defence, have not been re-constructed and are not A available for the Court. This position of disposal of an appeal on merits being only after perusal of record, has been held by a three-Judge Bench in Bani Singh (supra). 32.The Court below, in our considered view, by taking a mutually contradictory view, proceeded to decide the appeal on merits sentencing B the accused, forgetting that the challenge was also for conviction. And yet did not deal with the merits of the appeal, laying specific challenge to the of conviction. The whole approach is illegal and erroneous. Firstly, it is observed that the record was missing, and then it casts the onus to produce the same on the Appellant. C 33.In light of the abovementioned discussion, the Accused, in appeal, has a right to have the record perused by the Appellate Court and, therefore, upholding a conviction by merely having noted that the counsel for the accused not having the record at the time of filing the appeal is “doubtful” and that “no one can believe” the appeal would D have been filed without perusing the record, as observed by the High Court is not correct. The job of the Court of Appeal is not to depend on the lower Court’s to uphold the conviction but, based on the record available before it duly called from the Trial Court and the arguments advanced before it, to come to a conclusion thereon. E 34. In the facts at hand, the alleged offence in question was committed on 21.3.1995, and the of the Trial Court was delivered on 7.12.1999. More than 28 years have passed since the commission of the offence. As already indicated, the relevant Trial Court record has not been able to be reconstructed, despite the efforts of the courts below. Hence, in our considered view, as discussed above, ing a retrial is F not in the interest of justice and will not serve any fruitful purpose.
