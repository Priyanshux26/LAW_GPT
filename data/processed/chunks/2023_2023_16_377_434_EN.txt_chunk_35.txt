It is to be not 428 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. arbitrary, vague and fanciful, but legal and regular. And it must be exercised within the limit, to which an honest man, competent to the discharge of his offi ce ought to confi ne himself (per Lord Halsbury, L.C., in Sharp v. Wakefi eld [(1891 AC 173: (1886-90) All ER Rep 651 (HL)]. (Also See S.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India (AIR 1967 SC 1427). 22. The word “discretion” standing single and unsupported by circumstances signifi es exercise of , skill or wisdom as distinguished from folly, unthinking or haste; evidently therefore a discretion cannot be arbitrary but must be a result of judicial thinking. The word in it implies vigilant circumspection and care; therefore, where the legislature concedes discretion it also imposes a heavy responsibility….” (Emphasis supplied) 73. Again, in Clariant International Ltd. and Another v. Securities & Exchange Board of India reported in (2004) 8 SCC 524, this Court reiterated these principles thus; “27. In Kruger v. Commonwealth of Australia [(1997) 146 Aus LR 126] it is stated: “Moreover, when a discretionary power is statutorily conferred on a repository, the power must be exercised reasonably, for the legislature is taken to intend that the discretion be so exercised. Reasonableness can be determined only by reference to the community standards at the time of the exercise of the discretion and that must be taken to be the legislative intention.....” 28. The discretionary jurisdiction has to be exercised keeping in view the purpose for which it is conferred, the object sought to be achieved and the reasons for granting such wide discretion (See Narendra Singh v. Chhotey Singh [(1983) 4 SCC 131 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 788]. xxx xxx xxx 29. A discretionary jurisdiction, furthermore, must be exercised within the four corners of the statute. [See Akshaibar Lal (Dr.) v. Vice- Chancellor, Banaras Hindu University [(1961) 3 SCR 386 : AIR 1961 DR. PREMACHANDRAN KEEZHOTH & ANR. v. THE 429 CHANCELLOR KANNUR UNIVERSITY [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] SC 619] and also para 9-022 of de Smith, Woolf and Jowell: Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 5th Edn., p.445].” 74. Similar are the principles laid down in Joint Action Committee of Air Line Pilots’ Association of India (ALPAI) and Others v. Director General of Civil Aviation and Others reported in (2011) 5 SCC 435, where it has been held that: “26. ... It is a settled legal proposition that the authority which has been conferred with the competence under the statute alone can pass the . No other person, even a superior authority, can interfere with the functioning of the statutory authority. In a democratic set-up like ours, persons occupying key positions are not supposed to mortgage their discretion, volition and decision-making authority and be prepared to give way to carry out commands having no sanctity in law. Thus, if any decision is taken by a statutory authority at the behest or on suggestion of a person who has no statutory role to play, the same would be patently illegal.
