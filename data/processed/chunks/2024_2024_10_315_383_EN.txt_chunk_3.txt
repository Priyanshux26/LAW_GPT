[Para 22] ‘Application of mind’ – Concept of: Held: Application of mind must form part of any judicial, quasi- judicial or administrative – To demonstrate the same, consideration of material placed before such authority must be reflected – It being a cerebral exercise, it is not within reason to set out any formula to explain what application of mind may actually mean or look like – It is to be ascertained in the facts and circumstances of each case – In the context of penal laws, authorities tasked with evaluating material prior to granting of sanction for prosecution, or the act of granting sanction itself must apply their mind to each and every facet of the material placed before it to arrive at the conclusion particularly so because the effect of the task at hand is immense – Grant/non-grant of sanction is what sets in motion the machinery of strict laws such as UAPA or TADA. [Paras 25, 26] Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 – s.45(2) – Cognizance of offences – Procedure for sanction provided under the UAPA: Held: Court is enjoined from taking cognizance without previous sanction either by the Central Government or the State Government, as applicable, and such sanction shall only be given after the report of the authority appointed by the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, has been considered – This authority is to make an independent review of the evidence gathered and make a recommendation to the government within a time bound manner – If any Court takes cognizance without prior sanction of the Government, Centre or State, the same shall be in contravention of the Act and thus, bad in law – This sanction is not a function of the Government alone and it can only be granted 320 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports after an independent body, albeit appointed by the Government, makes an independent review of the evidence. [Paras 28, 28.1] Unlawful Activities (Prevention) (Recommendation & Sanction of Prosecution) Rules, 2008 – rr.3 and 4 – Time limit for making a recommendation by the Authority – Time limit for sanction of prosecution – Construction of: Held: Penal statutes are statutes to be interpreted strictly – Rules flowing from statutory power, have the effect of a statute – s.52 of the UAPA grants power to the Central Government to make Rules for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act – s.52(2)(ee) enables the Government to prescribe the time for recommendation and grant of sanction u/s.45 – Rules are unequivocal in both, using the word ‘shall’ as also providing a specfic time period for both activities, i.e., making recommendation and granting sanction – In matters of strict construction, when a timeline is provided, along with the use of the word ‘shall’ and particularly when the same is in the context of a law such as the UAPA, it cannot be considered a mere technicality or formality – It demonstrates clear intention on the part of the Legislature – Compulsion has been imposed, and for compliance with that compulsion, a timeline has been provided – While the legislation is aimed at curbing unlawful activities and practices detrimental to national security and accordingly, provides the authorities of the Government ample power to undertake and complete all procedures and processes permissible under law to that end, at the same time the interest of accused persons must also be safeguarded and protected – Time granted is only for consideration of the material collected by way of an independent review and then making a recommendation whereafter the sanctioning authority may then consider the materials as well as recommendation to finally, grant or deny the sanction – It is not for the purpose of the investigation itself, which understandably can be a time-consuming process, given the multiple variables involved – Timelines in such cases, serve as essential aspects of checks and balances and of course, are unquestionably important – Legislative intent is clear – Rules made by virtue of statutory powers prescribe both a mandate and a time limit – Same has to be followed – Strict adherence to the timeline mentioned in rr.
