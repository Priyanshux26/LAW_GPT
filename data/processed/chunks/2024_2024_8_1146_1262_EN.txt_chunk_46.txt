It is not in dispute that the Audit Report of the CAG has not been tabled before the Parliament for soliciting any comments from the PAC or the respective Ministries. Therefore, the views taken by the CAG to the effect that tremendous loss had been caused to the public exchequer on account of the coal rejects being disposed of by the KPCL and KECML remains a view point but cannot be accepted as decisive. The respondent–CBI has largely relied on the findings and the conclusions drawn in the Audit Report of the CAG to launch the prosecution against the appellants on an assumption that the said Report has the seal of approval of the Parliament and has attained finality, which is not the case. 12. DENIAL OF SANCTIONS BY THE SANCTIONING AUTHORITIES AND THE EFFECT ON THE APPELLANTS 12.1. It is relevant to note that the very same Audit objections taken by the CAG and relied upon by the respondent–CBI to allege 1224 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports conspiracy and loss to the public exchequer were thoroughly examined and found to be meritless by two separate set of Sanctioning Authorities. When it came to Mr. R. Nagaraja, the then Director (Finance) of KPCL and the nominee Director on the Board of KECML, the Sanctioning Authority, i.e., the Board of KPCL went through several documents during its deliberations including the MoU between the KECML and GCWL forwarded by the respondent–CBI for seeking sanction to prosecute him. The reasons for holding that the CAG Report was without any factual basis, were elaborately dealt with as below: “DETAILED REPORT OF THE BOARD OF KPCL IN RELATION TO THE CBI REPORT DATED 28.07.2017 AS REGARDS SHRI R. NAGARAJA xxxxx 1.8 There is an Memorandum of Understanding dated 20.12.2008 between Gupta Coal Fields and Washeries Ltd (‘GCWL’) and KECML under which GCWL was required to wash and supply the coal of required specification to the Power Plant of KPCL in respect of coal mined by KECML. Clause 12 of the said MoU stipulates that “the rejects generated shall be the joint property of KECML and GCWL and can be disposed off / sold at mutually agreed terms subject to compliance of rules / regulations / guidelines of Ministry of Coal, Government of India, if applicable”. KPCL allowed KECML to sign an MoU with Gupta under which rejects belonging to KPCL was put under the joint ownership of Gupta and KECML by virtue of Clause 12. Gupta has sold those rejects resulting in an illegal gain of Rs.52.37 crores to Gupta (as per CAG) and loss to KPCL. The Board of KECML which conspired to insert Clause 12 of the MoU did not take any protective / mitigative measures to prevent the loss despite it being raised at a lower level. The facts in relation to the above offence are elaborated in detail herein below. xxxxx [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1225 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation B.
