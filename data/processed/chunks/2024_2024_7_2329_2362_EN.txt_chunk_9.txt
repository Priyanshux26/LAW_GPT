(7) Nothing in sub-sections (2) to (6) shall apply in relation to any person― (a) who, immediately before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1985 (65 of 1985), is a citizen of India; (b) who was expelled from India before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1985, under the Foreigners Act, 1946 (31 of 1946). (8) Save as otherwise expressly provided in this section, the provisions of this section shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force.” 25. From the aforesaid, it is clear that a cut-off date of 25.03.1971 was fixed with regard to deciding the status of persons who had come to Assam on or after 01.01.1966 but before 25.03.1971 from the “specified territory”4 and from the date of entry have been ordinarily resident in Assam and been detected to be foreigners. Such persons were required to register themselves with the Registering Authority in accordance with rules made by the Central Government under Section 18 of the Citizenship Act. 26. In the Explanation to Sub-section (3) of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, it has been provided that the opinion of the Tribunal constituted 4 Section 6A(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act states: ‘“specified territory” means the territories included in Bangladesh immediately before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1985 (65 of 1985)’ [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2343 Md. Rahim Ali @ Abdur Rahim v. The State of Assam & Ors. under the 1964 holding the person to be a foreigner shall be deemed sufficient proof of the requirement under clause (c) of the sub-section aforesaid [viz. Section 6A(3)(c), Citizenship Act] and the same would also suffice for any other requirement of the Sub-section. If a question arises as to whether the person complies with any other requirement under this Sub-section, and the opinion of the Tribunal contains a finding qua such other requirement, the Registering Authority will decide the question in accordance with the opinion of the Tribunal. However, the Registering Authority is required to refer the matter to the Tribunal, if the opinion of the Tribunal is silent as to the other requirements, and thereupon the question is to be decided by the Registering Authority in conformity with the opinion received from the Tribunal. 27. The very initiation of the proceeding was under the 1964 . It is worthwhile to point out that the 1964 has been subjected to multiple amendments. Para 3 of the 1964 has also undergone variation – a different version was in existence when the Tribunal examined the matter. However, as we are expounding the law, it is deemed appropriate to refer to the position as it prevails on date. Para 3 of the 1964 , last amended by GSR dated 30.08.2019, reads as under: “3. Procedure for disposal of questions.—(1) The Tribunal shall serve on the person to whom the question relates, a copy of the main grounds5 on which he is alleged to be a foreigner and give him a reasonable opportunity of making a representation and producing evidence in support of his case and after considering such evidence as may be produced and after hearing such persons as may desire to be heard, the Tribunal shall submit its opinion to the officer or authority specified in this behalf in the of reference.
