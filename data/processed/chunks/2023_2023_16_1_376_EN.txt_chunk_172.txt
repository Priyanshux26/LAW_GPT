What has been done is that by adding clauses (aa) and (b) a defi nition is supplied which the Courts would have in any event given. Therefore, we do not agree that there has been any amendment of Article 370(1) by the backdoor. 29. If we had regarded this as an amendment to Article 370(1), then we would have to consider whether the amendatory powers had been validly exercised or not, but as we have said, we are not concerned with this question.” 416. Hence, the changes made by CO 74 were also clarifi catory and consequential in nature. They did not have the eff ect of amending Article 370. 417. Convention certainly does not stand in the way of this Court’s adjudication as to the legal validity of an impugned provision of law including a Constitutional . However, in this case, three of the four Constitutional s which have been issued in the past and which modify Article 367 do not amount to modifi cations of Article 370, either in terms or in eff ect, in a manner that is appreciable or signifi cant. These are CO 48, CO 56 and CO 74. The argument of the Union of India that these Constitutional s are indicative of the validity of CO 272 cannot be accepted. CO 44, IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 245 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] which modifi ed Article 370 by amending its language, was issued in a valid exercise of the power under Article 370(3) and hence does not come to the aid of the Union of India. b. Applying the entire Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir through exercise of power under Article 370(1)(d) 418. Article 370(1)(c) applies the provisions of Articles 1 and 370 to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370(1)(d) confers the President with the power to apply “other” provisions of the Constitution subject to “exceptions and modifi cations”. The President issued CO 272 in exercise of power under Article 370(1)(d) by which all the provisions of the Constitution were applied to Jammu and Kashmir. The petitioners argue that Article 370(1)(d) only contemplates a piece-meal approach, that is the application of specifi c provisions of the Constitution and not the application of the Constitution as a whole. They argue that the entire Constitution can only be applied by the exercise of power under Article 370(3) by issuing a declaration that Article 370 shall cease to exist. 419. We do not agree with the argument of the petitioners. Article 370(1)(d) states that “such other provisions” shall apply. The power under Article 370(1)(d) can be used to apply one provision, more than one provision, an entire Part of the Constitution, or all the provisions of the Constitution (that is, the entire Constitution). The provision does not make a distinction between one or all provisions of the Constitution. Non-application of mind cannot be claimed merely because the Constitution applies all provisions of the Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir in one go. 420.
