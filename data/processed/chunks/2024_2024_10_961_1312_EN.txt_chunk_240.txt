The claim of the petitioners is that Section 6A is violative of Article 29 because it permits people from Bangladesh who have a distinct culture to be ordinarily resident in Assam and 154 SR Bommai v. Union of India (1994) 3 SCC 1; In Re Article 370 of the Constitution, 2023 INSC 1058 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1293 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 secure citizenship which infringes upon their right to conserve Assamese culture. 92. The heading to Article 29(1) reads ‘protection of interests of minorities’. However, the text of the provision is not limited to minorities. It confers the right to any ‘section of citizens’ having a distinct language, script or culture. Thus, Article 29 applies to non-minorities as much as it applies to minorities, provided that (a) the section is of citizens; and (b) that section has a distinct language, script or culture.155 The right that is granted to this beneficiary class is the right to ‘conserve’ their language, script or culture. The people of Assam (the Assamese) are a section of citizens who have a distinct language, script of culture which they are entitled to conserve in terms of Article 29(1). 93. Two prominent points must be noted at the outset. First, Article 29(1) confers the right to ‘conserve’ culture, that is, the operation of the law must not interfere with the ability of the section to take steps to protect the culture from harm or destruction. Second, the provision must be read in light of the multi-cultural and plural nation that India is. 94. This Court has not had the opportunity to deal with the scope of Article 29(1) elaborately in the past. The provision has been considered in a limited manner when this Court had to determine the issue of whether the right guaranteed by Article 30 to establish minority educational institutions must be limited to the purpose of conserving language, script or culture.156 This Court held that a minority educational institution can be established for the purpose of conserving the language, culture and script but it is not necessary that it must be limited to that purpose.157 This Court in the context of the scope of the right to establish and administer minority educational institutions under Article 30(1) also observed that the right would include the choice of the medium of instruction. The imposition of the medium of instruction by the State would be violative of the right of minority educational institutions under Article 30(1) read with Article 29(1).158 155 See Ahmedabad St. Xavier’s College Society v.
