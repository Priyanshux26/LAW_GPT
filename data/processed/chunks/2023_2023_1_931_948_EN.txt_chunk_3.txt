The claim of the Appellant was rejected by the Respondents on the ground that children adopted by a widow of a B government servant, after the death of the government servant, would not be entitled to receive family pension as per Rule 54 (14) (b) of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as “CCS (Pension) Rules” for the sake of brevity). The Respondents’ decision was communicated to the Appellant by way of letter dated C 23rdFebruary, 2000. 3.4. Aggrieved by the Respondents’ rejection of his claim for family pension, the Appellant filed an Original Application, being O.A. No. 2166 of 2001, before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Mumbai, praying that the of D the Respondents dated 23rdFebruary, 2000 be quashed and set aside, as being illegal and unconstitutional. Further, a declaration that the Appellant is the adopted son of the deceased government employee and is therefore entitled to receive family pension, was also sought. E 3.5. The Central Administrative Tribunal, Mumbai, by an dated 19thJuly, 2002, allowed O.A. No. 2166 of 2001 filed by the Appellant and directed the Respondents to consider the Appellant’s claim for family pension by treating him as the adopted son of the deceased government employee, Shridar Chimurkar.

However, by way of G amendments to the said Rule in the year 1990 and 1993, the bar against children born or adopted after retirement, seeking family pension, was removed. That the of the Respondents dated 23rd February, 2000 would not survive in view of the aforesaid amendments. H 936 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A ii.
