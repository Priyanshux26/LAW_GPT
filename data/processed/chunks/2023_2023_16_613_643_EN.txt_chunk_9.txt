The Court further requested the Chief Justice of each High Court to constitute a committee of two or three Judges to monitor the selection process so that timely selection of judicial offi cers can be made. There were other directions as well. The diffi culty, however, was to fi gure out the number of vacancies to be advertised. As far as (a) existing vacancies and (b) future vacancies which were to come within one year due to retirement were concerned, there was no diffi culty in anticipating these vacancies. It is the third category which was given in “C” as “future vacancies” that created some confusion in diff erent States as there could be no clarity of what these vacancies would be or how they were to be calculated. Ultimately, a three Judge Bench of this Court in Malik Mazhar Sultan and Another v. Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission and Others (2009) 17 SCC 24 (hereafter referred to as “Malik Mazhar-2”) clarifi ed this aspect in its dated 24.03.2009 as follows: “1.

We further direct that ten per cent of unforeseen vacancies would be in respect of sanctioned posts and not vacancies occurring in a particular year.” 2. It has been pointed out by the counsel appearing for the various High Courts that 10% of the sanctioned posts are notifi ed in some States.
