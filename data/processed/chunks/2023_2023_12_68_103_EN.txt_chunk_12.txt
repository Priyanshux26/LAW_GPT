The duty of judicial review which the Constitution has bestowed upon the judiciary is not unfettered; it comes within the conception of judicial restraint. The principle of judicial restraint requires that Judges ought to decide cases while being within their defi ned limits of power. Judges are expected to interpret any law or any provision of the Constitution as per the limits laid down by the Constitution. 43. In S.C. Chandra v. State of Jharkhand [S.C. Chandra v. State of Jharkhand, (2007) 8 SCC 279 : (2007) 2 SCC (L&S) 897] , it has been ruled that the judiciary should exercise restraint and ordinarily should not encroach into the legislative domain. In this regard, a reference to a three-Judge Bench decision in Suresh Seth v. Indore Municipal Corpn. [Suresh Seth v. Indore Municipal Corpn., (2005) 13 SCC 287] is quite instructive. In the said case, a prayer was made before this Court to issue directions for appropriate amendment in the M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956. Repelling the submission, the Court held that it is purely a matter of policy which is for the elected UNION TERRITORY OF LADAKH v. JAMMU AND KASHMIR 87 NATIONAL CONFERENCE [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] representatives of the people to decide and no directions can be issued by the Court in this regard. The Court further observed that this Court cannot issue directions to the legislature to make any particular kind of enactment. In this context, the Court held that under our constitutional scheme, Parliament and Legislative Assemblies exercise sovereign power to enact law and no outside power or authority can issue a direction to enact a particular kind of legislation. While so holding, the Court referred to the decision in Supreme Court Employees’ Welfare Assn. v. Union of India [Supreme Court Employees’ Welfare Assn. v. Union of India, (1989) 4 SCC 187 : 1989 SCC (L&S) 569] wherein it was held that no court can direct a legislature to enact a particular law and similarly when an executive authority exercises a legislative power by way of a subordinate legislation pursuant to the delegated authority of a legislature, such executive authority cannot be asked to enact a law which it has been empowered to do under the delegated authority. 44. Recently, in Census Commr. v. R. Krishnamurthy [Census Commr. v. R. Krishnamurthy, (2015) 2 SCC 796 : (2015) 1 SCC (L&S) 589] , the Court, after referring to Premium Granites v. State of T.N. [Premium Granites v. State of T.N., (1994) 2 SCC 691] , M.P. Oil Extraction v. State of M.P.[M.P. Oil Extrac-tion v. State of M.P., (1997) 7 SCC 592] , State of M.P. v. Narmada Bachao An-dolan [State of M.P. v. Narmada Bachao Andolan, (2011) 7 SCC 639 : (2011) 3 SCC (Civ) 875] and State of Punjab v. Ram Lubhaya Bagga [State of Punjab v. Ram Lubhaya Bagga, (1998) 4 SCC 117 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1021] , held : (R. Krishnamurthy case [Census Commr. v. R. Krishnamurthy, (2015) 2 SCC 796 : (2015) 1 SCC (L&S) 589] , SCC p. 809, para 33) “33.
