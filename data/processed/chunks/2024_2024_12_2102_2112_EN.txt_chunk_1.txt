Supreme Court Reports / of the Supreme Court 1. Leave granted. 2. These appeals, by the Appellants, challenge the correctness of the s dated 12.07.2022 and 22.09.2022 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Writ C No.13134 of 2022 and Civil Misc. Review Application No.355 of 2022, respectively. By the impugned s, the High Court dismissed the writ petition as well as the review petition preferred by the Appellants, thereby upholding the actions taken by the Respondent authorities restricting the sale of a medicinal preparation known as “aromatic tincture of cardamom” at the Appellants’ medical shops. 3. The factual background giving rise to the present appeals are as follows: 3.1. The Appellants are proprietors of medical firms/shops engaged for several decades in the wholesale and retail sale of drugs and medicines at Agra, Uttar Pradesh. They hold valid and subsisting licenses under the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 (hereinafter, “D&C Act, 1940”) and the rules framed thereunder, permitting them to sell, stock, and distribute various drugs, including a herbal medicinal preparation commonly referred to as “aromatic tincture of cardamom.” 3.2. The said tincture, as stated by the Appellants, is a non- prescription, licensed medicine recognized under the D&C Act, 1940. It is used for treating mild ailments such as indigestion, flatulence, stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. The tincture is manufactured by licensed manufacturers who are approved by the Indian Government, and the Appellants procure their supplies from such recognized sources, including the British Pharmacopoeia-approved suppliers. 3.3. The Appellants submit that, despite the lawful nature of their business, the Respondent authorities—comprising officers from the Drug Control and Excise Departments of the State— subjected their shops to repeated inspections, abrupt closures, and harassment.

On earlier occasions, the Appellants approached the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, which, by an dated 27.09.2021, directed that the State authorities shall not interfere with the running of the Appellants’ business except in accordance with law. 3.5. Further grievances arose when the District Magistrate, Agra, issued s on 28.02.2022 constituting a joint team to curb the sale of “alcohol mixed tinctures,” and the Drug Inspector thereafter, on 11.04.2022, purportedly directed the Appellants not to sell aromatic tincture of cardamom. 3.6. Aggrieved by these actions, the Appellants filed Writ C No.13134 of 2022 before the High Court, seeking quashing of the impugned s restricting their trade and an interim direction permitting them to continue their lawful business. The High Court, however, dismissed the writ petition on 12.07.2022, holding inter alia that “alcohol mixed tincture is a prohibited article,” thereby upholding the actions taken by the Respondent authorities.
