OPS and the persons standing with him have serious questions as regards the legality and validity of the said notice dated 01.07.2022, essentially F for two reasons; one that the power to convene such meeting of General Council was with Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator acting jointly and with none other; and second, that this notice was sent only ten days before the scheduled meeting even though the byelaws require minimum 15 days’ notice. G 7.2. In the wake of the said notice dated 01.07.2022, the said Mr. M. Shanmugam(plaintiff of CS No. 111 of 2022) moved applications before the Division Bench of the High Court alleging breach of its dated 23.06.2022.

A interim dated 23.06.2022 was pertaining only to the meeting scheduled to be held on 23.06.2022 and the same could not be extended for an indefinite period. The Division Bench also made it clear that they were not expressing any opinion for the meeting scheduled to be held on 11.07.2022. B 8.
