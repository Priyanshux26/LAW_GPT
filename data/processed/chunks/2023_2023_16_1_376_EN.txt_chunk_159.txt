… 61. It is always important to remember that in matters aff ecting the Constitution of India, form always gives way to substance.” 381. From the above discussion, it emerges that the following aspects are of signifi cance when assessing whether a change has been made to a provision of the Constitution: a. A change may be either in terms of or in its eff ect; b. A change can be said to have been made even if the language of the concerned provision is not directly amended, by adding, subtracting or modifying the language. This is a change in eff ect; c. If the eff ect of an amendment is to change a provision, such eff ect must be signifi cant or appreciable; and d. The substance of a change is more important than its form. Although this position of law relates to the proviso to Article 368(2), it is equally applicable to Article 370(3). This is because the precedents discussed in this segment explore the manner in which a ‘change’ may be eff ected as well as what a ‘change’ means at its core. While Article 370(3) employs the word ‘modifi cation’ and not ‘change,’ the two terms are synonyms. Further, both articles concern, in essence, amendments to a provision of the Constitution. Therefore, the standards which have been 226 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. set out in the preceding paragraph to determine whether a ‘change’ was made apply to a determination of whether a ‘modifi cation’ was made. It follows that an assessment of whether a Constitutional amounts to a ‘modifi cation’ under Article 370(3) and consequently, whether the procedure under Article 370(1) or under Article 370(3) ought to have been followed depends on the standard set out in the preceding paragraph. IV. The validity of modifi cation of Article 367 382. The eff ect of a provision of law is as important as its form. In other words, what it actually does is as signifi cant as what it appears to do, if not more. While the change sought to be made by paragraph 2 of CO 272 may appear to be a ‘modifi cation’ or amendment of Article 367 at fi rst blush, its eff ect is to amend Article 370 itself. Paragraph 2 couches the amendment to Article 370 in the language of an amendment or modifi cation to Article 367 but its true import is to amend Article 370. 383. CO 272 purports to add Clause 4 to Article 367 and stipulates that the expression ‘Constituent Assembly’ in the proviso to Article 370(3) shall be read as ‘Legislative Assembly.’ The proviso to Article 370(3) states that the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly referred to in Clause 2 is necessary. Clause 2 of Article 370 refers to the Constituent Assembly for the purpose of framing the Constitution of the State. Thus, the proviso to Article 370(3) confers the power to make recommendations to that specifi c Constituent Assembly. CO 272 changes the language to the proviso to Article 370(3) in two ways.
