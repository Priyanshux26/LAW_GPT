275. Countering the Petitioners’ contentions, the Respondents submitted that demographic changes could not be a constitutionally valid metric for measuring cultural change. Changes to religious demographics could be traced to several different factors, including state reorganisation and internal migration. Further, they contended that the objective of Article 29(1) is to establish a multicultural society, and not an endogamous one. They argued that accepting the Petitioners’ argument would lead to cultural exclusivity, which they felt was not constitutionally permissible. Further, they also urged that a constitutional culture exists in India, which ought not to be endangered on the basis of demographic change. (a) Background of Article 29 276. Article 29(1) of the Constitution, which is included in Part III, confers upon any section of citizens residing in the territory of India, the right to conserve its language, script or culture. The text of the provision reads as follows: "29. Protection of interests of minorities. — (1) Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same.” 277. Incorporated into the constitutional framework with a distinctive approach to bestowing rights upon a segment of the populace, this provision underwent extensive debate and scrutiny within the halls of the Constituent Assembly. The deliberations surrounding this provision serve as an invaluable resource for comprehensively understanding the significance of Article 29, affording us insight into the overarching intent of its framers during the formulation of this particular provision. 1112 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 278. Article 29, which was then draft Article 23 prior to its inclusion into the Constitution, was the subject matter of intense debate, with respect to both the terms used in the provision itself and the import of the rights it conferred. Although draft Article 23 initially used the term ‘minority’, it was substituted for the words ‘section of citizens’. This change was made keeping in mind the diversity of India and with the aim of ensuring that children received education in the language of their choice, while simultaneously making sure that they continued to learn the language of whichever State they may be a part of.183 Thereafter, the term ‘section of citizens’ got crystallised to the extent that attempts to replace it with the term ‘minority’ were negatived by the Assembly.184 With that, Article 29, as we are familiar with today, found its place as a part of the Constitution. 279. Provisions akin to Article 29(1), which establish a right to preserve culture, can be identified in numerous Constitutions across various jurisdictions. For instance, Article 20(2) of the Constitution of Albania grants the right to ‘preserve and develop’ ethnic, cultural, and linguistic identity. A similar right is articulated in Article 56 of the Armenian Constitution, Article 11 of the Georgian Constitution, Article 59 of the Kosovan Constitution, Article 114 of the Latvian Constitution, and Article 35(1) of the Polish Constitution. While these provisions share the common objective of cultural preservation, they vary slightly from Article 29(1) by incorporating the term ‘develop’.
