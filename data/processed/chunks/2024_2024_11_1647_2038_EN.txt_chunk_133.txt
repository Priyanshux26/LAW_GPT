Father W. Proost and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors. [1969] 2 SCR 73, para 8; Ahmedabad St. Xaviers College Society and Anr. v. State of Gujarat and Anr., AIR 1974 SC 1389, para 10. 98 In Re: The Kerala Education Bill, supra note 58; Para 32; P.A. Inamdar, supra note 48, para 97. 1840 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports held that the term ‘administration’ does not include maladministration. In other words, while the minority community has the right to administer the institution, the regulatory measures imposed by the State that merely regulate the educational standards are not included within the right of ‘administration’.99 176. To this end, the State has the power to prescribe, inter alia: compliance requirements of the government for granting recognition to the university, if they largely and substantially leave unimpaired the right of administration in regard to internal affairs of the institution;100 general laws of the land applicable to all persons, such as laws relating to taxation, sanitation, social welfare, economic regulation, public and morality, or general regulations regarding welfare of students and teachers;101 regulations requiring transparency and merit in admission procedure;102 regulations restricting charging of capital fee;103 regulations which mandate that there is a govt. nominee in admission process, that fix merit criteria for minority students, or which mandate that the vacant seats shall go to non-minority students;104 etc. 177. Similarly, this Court has held that in a minority institution, there can be a sprinkling of outsiders in administration, and the mere presence of members of the non-minority community does not take away the minority character of the institution.105 178. However, at the same time, there is a core part of ‘administration’ that should remain in control of the minority community.
