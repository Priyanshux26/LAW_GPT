62. The concept of retrospective and retroactive statute was stated by this Court in Darshan Singh v. Ram Pal Singh [Darshan Singh v. Ram Pal Singh, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 191] , thus: (SCC pp. 211-13, paras 35-37) 13 2020 (9) SCC 1 596 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “35. Mr Sachar relies on Gokal Chand v. Parvin Kumari [Gokal Chand v. Parvin Kumari, (1952) 1 SCC 713 : AIR 1952 SC 231] , Garikapati Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhry [Garikapati Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhry, AIR 1957 SC 540] , Jose Da Costa v. Bascora Sadasiva Sinai Narcornim [Jose Da Costa v. Bascora Sadasiva Sinai Narcornim, (1976) 2 SCC 917] , Govind Das v. CIT [Govind Das v. CIT, (1976) 1 SCC 906 : 1976 SCC (Tax) 133] , Henshall v. Porter [Henshall v. Porter, (1923) 2 KB 193] , United Provinces v. Atiqa Begum [United Provinces v. Atiqa Begum, 1940 SCC OnLine FC 11 : AIR 1941 FC 16] , in support of his submission that the Amendment Act was not made retrospective by the legislature either expressly or by necessary implication as the Act itself expressly provided that it shall be deemed to have come into force on 23-1- 1973; and therefore there would be no justification to giving it retrospective operation. The vested right to contest which was created on the alienation having taken place and which had been litigated in the court, argues Mr Sachar, could not be taken away. In other words, the vested right to contest in appeal was not affected by the Amendment Act. However, to appreciate this argument we have to analyse and distinguish between the two rights involved, namely, the right to contest and the right to appeal against the lower court’s decision. Of these two rights, while the right to contest is a customary right, the right to appeal is always a creature of statute. The change of the forum for appeal by enactment may not affect the right of appeal itself. In the instant case we are concerned with the right to contest and not with the right to appeal as such. There is also no dispute as to the propositions of law regarding vested rights being not taken away by an enactment which is ex facie or by implication not retrospective. But merely because an Act envisages a past act or event in the sweep of its operation, it may not necessarily be said to be retrospective. Retrospective, according to Black’s Law Dictionary, means looking backward; contemplating what is past; having reference to a statute or things existing before the Act in question. Retrospective law, according to the same dictionary, means a law which looks backwards [2024] 1 S.C.R. 597 Nara Chandrababu Naidu v. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr. or contemplates the past; one which is made to affect acts or facts occurring, or rights occurring, before it came into force. Every statute which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect to transactions or considerations already past.
