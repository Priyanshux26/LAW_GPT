The date of the Registration Certification is 08.07.2008, which was after the passing of H 10 1965 3 SCR 307 / AIR 1965 SC 1722 SABIR ALI KHAN v. SYED MOHD. AHMAD ALI KHAN AND 955 OTHERS [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] the by the High Court. Here again, the procedure under Section A 36 of the Act was not followed. The particulars, which are to be mandatorily specified were missing. In the absence of a valid registration, the summary procedure provided in Section 52 of the Act was not available to the appellants. The appellants are estopped from challenging the compromise of 1974, after a period of 22 years. The parties to the B compromise acted upon the same. The second sale took place. Appellant being the son of the transferor stood estopped. The dismissal of the writ petition filed by Sujad Ali Khan as not pressed, has led to dated 12.09.1974, becoming final. Respondents have been in continuous and uninterrupted possession. The Limitation Act was applicable to the Waqf properties under Mohammedan Law till the Act came into force, C whereunder, Section 107 specifically barred the application of the Limitation Act, 1963. Reliance is placed on the of the Privy Council in 1940 XXI ILR 493. Also, support is drawn from the of this Court in Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui and others v. Union of India11. Section 107 of the Limitation Act, 1963 was prospective in its application. D Our attention is drawn to the of this Court in T. Kaliamurthi (supra). The respondents have been in possession of two-thirds of the suit property since the first sale deed and the remaining one-third came by their possession in 1974. Documentary evidence establishing such possession include the following: E i. dated 16.07.1997 by the Controller, Waqf Board; ii. Sale deed dated 26.09.1974; iii. The averments in the appeal (No.4 of 1998) filed by the respondent before the District and Sessions Judge, Bulandshehar; F iv. dated 30.05.1998 passed by the District Judge; v. The Waqf Appeal No. 3 of 2002; vi. The findings of the of the Tribunal; vii. The admission of the possession of the respondents by the G appellant in the impugned and, lastly, viii. Reliance is placed on the very List of Dates submitted by the appellant, which indicates that the of the Collector was for recovery of possession. 11 (1994) 6 SCC 360 H 956 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 12. Thus, it is contended that the respondents have been in possession of two-thirds since 1960 and remaining one-third since 1974 and the rights of the respondents emerged before the Act came into force. Even counting from 1974 the respondents have perfected title in the year 1986, i.e., 12 years from 1974. Thus, the Limitation Act, 1963 would indeed apply as hostile possession had led to the ripening of the B title before Section 107 of the Act came into force. 13. It is next pointed out that the appointment of Mutawalli did not lead to a fresh starting point of limitation.
