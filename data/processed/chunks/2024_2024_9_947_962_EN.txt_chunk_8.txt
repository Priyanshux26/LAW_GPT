The reliance placed by the plaintiffs on Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra to bring their sisters for execution cannot absolve them of their responsibility to demonstrate readiness and willingness. In contracts involving multiple parties with distinct interests, especially when some parties are absent or not signatories, the onus is on the plaintiff to ensure that all necessary consents and participations are secured. The plaintiffs’ passive approach and failure to act proactively undermine their claim of readiness and willingness. Moreover, the plaintiffs did not raise any objection or take legal action immediately after the expiry of the three-month period specified in the agreement. Their delay in asserting their rights and pursuing the completion of the contract further indicates a lack of earnestness. It was only after the sale deed was executed in favour of the appellants that the plaintiffs sought to enforce the agreement, which suggests an afterthought rather than genuine intent. 13. In light of the above reasoning, we agree with the Trial Court’s findings that the plaintiffs failed to prove their continuous readiness and willingness to perform their part of the contract as mandated under Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act. The High Court erred in not adequately addressing this critical aspect and in overlooking the plaintiffs’ inaction and lack of diligence. The plaintiffs’ failure to comply with the essential terms of the agreement and to take necessary steps within the stipulated time demonstrates a lack of readiness and willingness, which is fatal to their claim for specific performance. II. General Power of Attorney and validity of the Sale agreement dated 06.06.1993. 14. In contracts involving multiple owners of property, it is imperative that all co-owners either personally execute the agreement to sell [2024] 9 S.C.R. 959 Janardan Das & Ors. v. Durga Prasad Agarwalla & Ors. or duly authorize an agent to act on their behalf through a valid and subsisting power of attorney. An agent’s authority must be clear and unambiguous, and any limitations or revocations of such authority must be duly considered. Without proper authority, an agent cannot bind the principals to a contract of sale. 15. The Trial Court examined the General Power of Attorney dated 30.12.1982, purportedly executed by Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 and late Soumendra in favour of Defendant No. 1 and held that the GPA was unregistered and executed over a decade prior to the agreement to sell. Moreover, the Trial Court also observed that GPA was not referenced or relied upon in the agreement dated 06.06.1993 and there was no mention that Defendant No. 1 was acting as an agent on behalf of his sisters under the GPA. It was held that the Defendant No. 1 signed the agreement solely in his personal capacity, and there was no indication that he was executing it on behalf of Defendant Nos. 6 to 8. The High Court disagreed with the Trial Court, holding that the GPA was valid and in force at the time of the agreement. It opined that the lack of explicit reference to the GPA in the agreement did not invalidate Defendant No.
