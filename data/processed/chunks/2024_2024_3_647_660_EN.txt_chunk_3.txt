3.10 Aggrieved by the rejection of the petition for quashing of criminal complaints, the appellant herein filed the present appeal. 3.11 Vide dated 12 th December 2022, this Court had issued notice and stay of further proceedings qua the appellant was granted. 4. We have heard Shri Manoj V. George, learned counsel for the appellant and Shri Lakshmeesh S. Kamath, learned counsel appearing for the respondent. 5. Shri Manoj V. George, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant is an aged-lady and was not involved in the day-to- day affairs of the Company. It is submitted that even in the complaint there are no averments that the appellant was in-charge of day-to- day affairs of the Company. It is further submitted that the appellant was also not a signatory to the cheque in question. It was only the accused No.2 who was the signatory to the cheque. It is, therefore, submitted that the High Court has grossly erred in not allowing the petition for quashing of criminal complaints qua the appellant. Learned counsel relied on the s of this Court in the cases of N.K. Wahi vs. Shekhar Singh and others1, S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. Neeta Bhalla and another2 Ashoke Mal Bafna vs. Upper India Steel Manufacturing and Engineering Company Limited3, Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti and others vs Pilibhit Pantnagar Beej Ltd. and another4 and Laxmi Dyechem vs. State of Gujarat and others5 in support of his submissions. 1 [2007] 3 SCR 883 : (2007) 9 SCC 481 2 [2005] Suppl. 3 SCR 371 : (2005) 8 SCC 89 3 (2018) 14 SCC 202 4 [2003] Suppl. 6 SCR 344 : (2004) 1 SCC 391 5 [2012] 11 SCR 466 : (2012) 13 SCC 375 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 653 Susela Padmavathy Amma v. M/S Bharti Airtel Limited 6. Shri Lakshmeesh S. Kamath, learned counsel for the respondent, on the contrary, submitted that the learned judge of the High Court has rightly, after considering the material on record, dismissed the petition for quashing of criminal complaints qua the appellant. It is submitted that the grounds raised are the defense of the accused and it can only be raised at the stage of the trial. It is, therefore, submitted that no interference is warranted in the present appeal. 7. In the case of State of Haryana vs. Brij Lal Mittal and others6, this Court observed thus: “8. Nonetheless, we find that the impugned of the High Court has got to be upheld for an altogether different reason. Admittedly, the three respondents were being prosecuted as directors of the manufacturers with the aid of Section 34(1) of the Act which reads as under: “34. Offences by companies.—(1) Where an offence under this Act has been committed by a company, every person who at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly: Provided that nothing contained in this sub- section shall render any such person liable to any punishment provided in this Act if he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence.” It is thus seen that the vicarious liability of a person for being prosecuted for an offence committed under the Act by a company arises if at the material time he was in charge of and was also responsible to the company for the conduct of its business.
