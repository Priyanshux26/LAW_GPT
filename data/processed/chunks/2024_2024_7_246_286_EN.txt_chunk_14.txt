[2024] 7 S.C.R. 267 Nipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors. against stereotyping to the anti-discrimination code under Article 15, the right to dignity and to equality. 33. For instance, in Anuj Garg v. Hotel Association of India,48 this Court struck down a law that barred women’s employment in premises where liquor was consumed. Such an indirectly discriminatory law was held to be inflicted by “incurable fixations of stereotype morality and conceptions of sexual role”.49 In Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India,50 this Court found that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was discriminatory and premised on stereotypes about binary genders and the role of sex. It singled out a class of people on a basis proscribed under Article 15(1)51. A provision that was based on and perpetuated stereotypes deprived certain individuals of their right to equal participation as citizens and equal enjoyment of life.52 In Indian Young Lawyers Association v. State of Kerala53, a Constitution Bench of which one of us was a part (Dr DY Chandrachud), found that stereotypes about sex undercut dignity. The paternalistic notion that women were a weaker sex was found to be contrary to the dignity of women (inter alia) and as such, impermissible.54 The Constitution envisions dignity, liberty and equality as imperatives for a dignified society. The “dehumanising effect of stereotypes” has been recognised by this Court in upholding the rights of those at the receiving end of these prejudicial notions and biases.55 III. The Framework of the RPwD Act, 2016 34. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, inspired by the Social Model of Disability, marks a significant legislative step forward. This model, which gained prominence after the American Civil Rights Movement, uses the term “person with disability” instead of “disabled person,” emphasizing the individuality of people rather than their disabilities. According to the Social model, disability arises not from 48 [2007] 12 SCR 991 : (2008) 3 SCC 1 49 Anuj Garg (supra). [46] 50 [2018] 7 SCR 379 : (2018) 10 SCC 1 51 Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018) 10 SCC 1 [Justice Chandrachud, 460] 52 ibid [608] 53 [2018] 9 SCR 561: (2019) 11 SCC 1 54 ibid, [Justice Chandrachud, 297] 55 Indian Young Lawyers Association (supra) [300] 268 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports a person’s impairments but from the artificial barriers imposed by society and the environment. 35. The RPwD Act defines a person with a disability as someone with a long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairment that, in interaction with societal barriers, hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others56. 36. For the first time, the 2001 Census counted people with disabilities. This inclusion marked a step towards recognizing persons with disabilities as a distinct group deserving of rights tailored to their needs. Earlier efforts, such as the Mental Health Act of 1987 and the establishment of the Rehabilitation Council of India in 1986, laid the groundwork for these advancements.
