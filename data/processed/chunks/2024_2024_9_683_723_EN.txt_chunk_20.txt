12.1 While making the reference as above, the bench observed that right to life and liberty is sacrosanct. Appellant had suffered incarceration of over 90 days. The above questions referred to a larger bench would require in depth consideration. Therefore, appellant was directed to be released on interim bail in connection with ECIR No. HIU-II/14/2022 dated 22.08.2022 on the same terms which were imposed earlier while granting temporary bail on 10.05.2024. 13. CBI filed its final chargesheet naming the appellant for the first time as an accused on 29.07.2024. 14. Appellant filed Bail Application No. 2285/2024 before the High Court under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. seeking regular bail in the CBI case. On 05.07.2024, a learned Judge of the High Court issued notice. Thereafter, arguments were heard on interim bail on 17.07.2024. However, the case was directed to be listed again on 29.07.2024 at 03:00 PM. On 29.07.2024, arguments were heard and the was reserved. 14.1 Seven days thereafter the was delivered on 05.08.2024. Without deciding the bail application on merit, the High Court disposed of the same giving liberty to the appellant to approach the Court of Special Judge for regular bail saying that such a course of action would be more beneficial to the appellant. 15. From the narration of facts as noted above, it is seen that CBI had registered its case RC No. 0032022A0053 on 17.08.2022. A total of four chargesheets were filed by CBI in the case naming 17 persons as accused. Appellant Arvind Kejriwal was not named as an accused in those chargesheets. 16. In the meanwhile, ED recorded ECIR No. HIU-II/14/2022 under PMLA on 22.08.2022. ED filed seven complaints under PMLA. In none of the above complaints, appellant was named as an accused. However, appellant was arrested by the ED in the PMLA case on 21.03.2024. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 713 Arvind Kejriwal v. Central Bureau of Investigation 17. On 20.06.2024, appellant was granted regular bail by the learned Special Judge in the ED case. On oral mentioning, this bail was stayed by the High Court on 21.06.2024. 18. It was thereafter that CBI sought for custody of the appellant in the CBI case which was allowed by the learned Special Judge on 24.06.2024. 19. Finally, this Court granted interim bail to the appellant in the PMLA case on 12.07.2024. 20. CBI filed the fifth and final chargesheet in the CBI case on 29.07.2024 wherein appellant has been named as an accused. 21. Since appellant’s arrest by the ED, bail granted by the learned Special Judge and stay of bail by the High Court in the PMLA case are subject matter of parallel proceedings where appellant has been granted interim bail by this Court, I would refrain from commenting thereon. Therefore, I will confine this opinion only to two aspects: arrest of the appellant and the of the High Court. Arrest of the appellant by the CBI: necessity and timing 22. In so far arrest of the appellant by the CBI is concerned, it raises more questions than it seeks to answer.
