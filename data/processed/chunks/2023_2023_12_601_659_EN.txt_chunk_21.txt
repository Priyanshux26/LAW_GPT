several persons and the action taken under Act 632 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. No.9 of 1977. As many as 71 sale deeds were executed in respect of the assigned lands….. x-x-x-x 18. Meaning thereby in respect of assigned lands, sale deeds were executed which were impermissible in law. The aforesaid issue was never the subject matter of earlier litigation and therefore, by no stretch of imagination, it could have been held by the learned Single Judge that the proceedings dated 27.01.2007 are hit by res judicata.” 40. The reasoning assigned by the Division Bench of the High Court is, thus, founded on the premise that the cause of action in the Second SCN is diff erent from the First SCN. In response to the same, Appellants have extensively referred to the resumption dated 10.05.2003 which was passed in furtherance of the proceedings conducted in First SCN to state that the same actively considered the issue of the sale deeds executed by M.A. Baksh as well the contravention of 1977 Act. It was urged that since the First SCN was set aside by the High Court through its dated 21.04.2006, the observations in the resumption dated 10.05.2003 would eff ectively merge with the fi ndings of the High Court dated 21.04.2006 and therefore the Second SCN alleging identical violations should be held to be barred by the doctrine of res judicata. 41. However, we do not fi nd ourselves in agreement with this line of thought for the precise reason that the High Court in its dated 21.04.2006 had emphatically held that the First SCN was issued without jurisdiction and set the same aside, instead of dealing with resumption dated 10.05.2003 on merits. In eff ect, the resumption dated 10.05.2003 was held to be a nullity. Therefore in light of the settled law as expounded by this Court in A. Jithendernath v. Jubilee Hills Coop. House Building Society13, doctrine of res judicata would not be applicable as an being a nullity never existed in the eyes of the law. 42. Coming to the issue of the fi nding in High Court’s dated 21.04.2006 with respect to the demise of M.A. Baksh making the GPA redundant, it is may be noticed that the same is materially diff erent from the 13 A. Jithendernath v. Jubilee Hills Coop. House Building Society (2006) 10 SCC 96. YADAIAH AND ANR. v. STATE OF TELANGANA AND 633 OTHERS [SURYA KANT, J.] violations as alleged in the Second SCN and held in the impugned . On closer scrutiny, we may point out that the aforesaid observation regarding the GPA executed in favour of M.A. Baksh was not a fundamental determination but only a collateral determination. In this context, the decision of this Court in Pawan Kumar Gupta v. Rochi Ram Nag Deo14 may be usefully cited which observes that:– “16. The rule of res judicata incorporated in section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) prohibits the Court from trying an issue which “has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties”, and has been heard and fi nally decided by that Court.
