(b) A proviso must be construed with reference to the preceding parts of the clause to which it is appended. (c) Where the proviso is directly repugnant to a section, the proviso shall stand and be held a repeal of the section as the proviso speaks the latter intention of the makers. (d) Where the section is doubtful, a proviso may be used as a guide to its interpretation; but when it is clear, a proviso cannot imply the existence of words of which there is no trace in the section. V. SENTHIL BALAJI v. THE STATE REPRESENTED BY 925 DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] (e) The proviso is subordinate to the main section. (f) A proviso does not enlarge an enactment except for compelling reasons. (g) Sometimes an unnecessary proviso is inserted by way of abundant caution. (h) A construction placed upon a proviso which brings it into general harmony with the terms of section should prevail. (i) When a proviso is repugnant to the enacting part, the proviso will not prevail over the absolute terms of a later Act directed to be read as supplemental to the earlier one. (j) A proviso may sometimes contain a substantive provision.” (emphasis supplied) DOES SECTION 167(2) OF THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, 1973 RESTRICT A POLICE CUSTODY ONLY TO THE FIRST 15 DAYS OF REMAND? 76. We have given our interpretation on the scope and ambit of Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973. With due respect, we are unable to concur with the views expressed in Anupam J. Kulkarni (supra) to the eff ect that a police custody shall only be within the fi rst 15 days of remand. Nowhere under Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 such a stipulation is found either directly or indirectly. The words such as “time to time”, “such custody”, and “in the whole” mentioned under Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 have not been properly taken note of and interpreted. What is required is a simple and natural interpretation when there is no semblance of ambiguity. 77. The intendment behind the proviso has also not been construed. Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973, as stated, does a fi ne balancing act between the liberty of an individual and a proper investigation. Perhaps, this Court was keeping in mind the earlier CrPC, 1898 which restricts the period of investigation to 15 days alone. Once the period is given as 60 days or 90 days as the case may be, to an investigating agency, in tune with the proviso, Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 by even normal interpretation facilitates 926 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. a police custody spanning over the said period, but “whole” being for 15 days. It appears to us that a clear provision has not been construed correctly, while adding certain words. 78. The decision in Chaganti Satyanarayana v. State of Andhra Pradesh, (1986) 3 SCC 141 has also been misconstrued. Though the facts are a bit diff erent in the said decision, this Court has rightly understood sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the CrPC, 1973: “16.
