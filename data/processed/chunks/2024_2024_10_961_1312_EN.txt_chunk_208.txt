The provision also states that the commencement of the Constitution, where used in the Constitution means 26 January 1950. In terms of Article 394, Article 6 came into force on “at once”, that is, immediately after the Constitution was adopted. The Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949. Thus, for migrants after 19 July 1948 to secure citizenship in terms of Article 6, the application ought to have been filed before 26 January 1950.
