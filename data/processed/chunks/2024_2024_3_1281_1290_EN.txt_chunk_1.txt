Sri Bipul Kanti Basak & Ors. Appearances for Parties Pallav Shishodia, Sr. Adv., Danish Zubair Khan, Dr. Lokendra Malik, Advs. for the Appellants. Uday Gupta, Sr. Adv., Chandra Bhushan Prasad, Advs. for the Respondents. / of the Supreme Court Vikram Nath, J. 1. This matter pertains to right to title and possession of a property that was allotted by the Relief and Rehabilitation Department of Government of West Bengal to a family which had come to Siliguri from the then East Pakistan in 1950. Before moving forward with the facts of the case, it is imperative for us to mention that such rehabilitation programmes are introduced by the government with the sole aim of re-establishment of the displaced/ migrant families and not for the benefit of any individual. As a part of such welfare policies, the property is usually recorded in the name of one family member for the purpose of convenience even though the ensuing welfare is meant to be enjoyed by the all the family members equally. However unfortunately, in the instant case greed got better of the de facto head of the family who has been claiming herself as the absolute owner of the property. The matter is a prime example where the plaintiff attempted to defeat the rightful claims of family members with the intention of usurping the entire property. We cannot emphasize enough that this Court highly deprecates such malpractices where the welfare legislations are misused/abused by beneficiaries for personal advantage, thereby defeating the very objective of such policies. 2.
