DA on basis of Rates fixed by Central Government The recommendation of the SNJPC is that Dearness E Allowance may be paid at the rate fixed by the Central Government. A fixed rate of Dearness Allowance would also ensure that there is no lag in the accrual of the dearness allowance to the judicial officers. A uniform rate of DA would achieve the goals of uniformity as well as efficiency. In such circumstances, the recommendation deserves acceptance. [Paras 62, 63][64-E,G; F 65-A] VIII.

[Paras 64, 69][65-B; 66-D-E] H 30 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A All India Judges Association (III) v. Union of India, (2002) 4 SCC 247 : [2002] 2 SCR 712; All India Judges Association (3) v. Union of India (2010) 15 SCC 170; All India Judges Assn. v. Union of India (2022) 7 SCC 494 – referred to. B IX. Delay in Grant of ACP A perusal of the Commission’s Report shows that, in many states, the grant of ACP scale is delayed. The SNJPC’s finding that the lack of timely preparation and scrutiny of ACR is the primary reason behind delay is concerning. ACRs are bound to C be done in a timely manner and without delay so as to ensure that the whole judicial system is functioning in an efficient manner. Accordingly, the High Courts may be directed to ensure that the delay in making ACRs is avoided in the future. To avoid this delay in the future, the Commission suggested that the process of grant of ACP should be initiated 3 months in advance from the D date on which the judicial officers will be completing 5/10 years and the financial benefits should be paid to the judicial officer within a period of 6 months after the judicial officer steps into the 6th/11th year of Service.
