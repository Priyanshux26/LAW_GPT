Facts reveal that no action was initiated during the license year of 2009-2010. 5. On 29.03.2011, Rule 19 was substituted by an amendment. The relevant portion of substituted provision is as follows: “Rule 19. Penalties4 (1) … (2) On all deficiencies in excess of the limits allowed under rule 16 and rule 17, the F.L.-9, F.L-9-A, F.L.- 10-B Licensee shall be liable to pay penalty at a rate not exceeding the duty payable on foreign liquor at that time, as may be imposed by the Excise Commissioner or any officer authorized by him: Provided that if it be proved to the satisfaction of the Excise Commissioner or the authorized officer that such excess deficiency or loss was due to some unavoidable causes like fire or accident and its First Information Report was lodged in concerned Police 4 Hereinafter, “the substituted Rule”. [2024] 4 S.C.R. 673 Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. Station, he may waive the penalty imposable under this sub-rule.” (emphasis supplied) 6. As is evident, the above referred substituted Rule 19 reduces penalty from four times the maximum duty payable to an amount not exceeding the duty payable on foreign liquor. 7. Eight months after the amendment, a demand notice dated 22.11.2011 was issued directing payment of penalty for exceeding the permissible limits during the license year 2009-2010. The notice demanded penalty of four times the duty as per the old Rule 19. The appellant replied, inter alia contending that penalty, if any, can only be under the substituted Rule 19 as the old rule stood repealed, and in fact, the demand is raised after the substituted Rule came into force. 8. The Deputy Commissioner5 rejected the objections raised by the appellant and confirmed the demand for payment of penalty at four times the duty payable. The Deputy Commissioner’s was upheld by the Excise Commissioner6, and thereafter by the Revenue Board Gwalior7. 9. Questioning the decisions of the statutory authorities, the appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court which was heard and disposed of with 40 other petitions raising a similar issue. The Single Judge of the High Court was of the view that the new Rule was introduced by way of a substitution and following the principles in State of Rajasthan v. Mangilal Pindwal8, West U.P. Sugar Mills Association v. State of U.P.9, Zile Singh, Government of India v. Indian Tobacco Association10, he held that the old Rule stood repealed from the statute book and only the substituted Rule applies to all pending and future proceedings. He, therefore, set aside the s of the statutory authorities and remanded the matter back to them for determining the penalty as per the substituted Rule. 5 By dated 18.04.2012 6 By dated 02.05.2013 7 By dated 10.12.2013 8 [1996] Supp. 3 SCR 98 : (1996) 5 SCC 60 9 [2002] 1 SCR 897 : (2002) 2 SCC 645 10 [2005] Supp. 2 SCR 859 : (2005) 7 SCC 396 674 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
