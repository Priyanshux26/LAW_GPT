The proviso was held to have merely fixed the date of the lease for reckoning the purchase price to be paid to the landlord. Thereby, no new tenancy was created and Section 32-O of 1 [2006] Supp. 6 SCR 843 : (2006) 11 SCC 161 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 609 Baban Balaji More (Dead) by LRs. & others v. Babaji Hari Shelar (Dead) by LRs. & others the Tenancy Act did not stand attracted. It was held that the proviso to Section 8 had a limited role to play and it merely postponed the operation of the statute. It was held that it had to be read in the light of Section 32G and Section 32O of the Tenancy Act and be interpreted accordingly, i.e., it did not create any right in favour of the landlord nor did it take away the right of the tenant. 25. It would be apposite at this stage to take note of the decisions of the Bombay High Court on various issues arising under these three legislations. In its Full Bench decision in Dattatraya Keshav Deshpande vs. Tukaram Raghu Chorage2, the Court held that Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the 1874 Act were framed to protect Watan property from unauthorized alienations and the Collector is empowered under Section 11 to declare any such unauthorized alienation to be null and void after recording his reasons in writing. This , having been rendered long before the other two legislations came into existence, has to be understood keeping in mind the later developments in the context of the Tenancy Act and the Abolition Act. The 1874 Act, therefore, cannot be treated as an independent, self-contained and complete code in itself. 26. In Govind Ramchandra Patil vs. Bapusaheb Krishnarao Patil and others3, a Division Bench dealt with the question as to whether a lease granted by a Watandar would continue to operate to the benefit of the tenants by virtue of the provisions of the Tenancy Act despite the Abolition Act. The Bench opined that the intention of the legislature was clear that the tenants on the land, who were lessees before the Tenancy Act came into force, should continue to be on the land unless the landlord himself required the land for his personal cultivation or the tenant was guilty of any defaults mentioned in Section 14 of the Tenancy Act. The Bench, therefore, concluded that it was not open to the Watandar to ask for a declaration under Section 11 of the 1874 Act that the lease became null and void and pray for restoration of possession of the land. Though it was argued that the Watandar was only asking for a declaration under Section 5 of the 1874 Act that the tenancy had become null and void on account of the death of the original Watandar, the Bench opined 2 AIR 1921 Bom 17 3 Special Civil Application No.1741 of 1961, decided on 13.12.1962 610 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
