It held that for computer literacy, self-certification was always acceptable and therefore, the CCC certificate having the self-certification could very well be accepted. The Division Bench thereby allowed the appeals reversing the and of the learned Single Judge and dismissing the writ petitions. 19. The of the Division Bench of the High Court was carried to this Court in three appeals in the case of Mukul Kumar Tyagi (supra). It will be relevant to refer to the following observations of this Court: “53. The candidates who had CCC certificate from NIELIT/DOEACC and who were included in the merit list dated 14-7-2015 were not affected by the of the learned Single Judge dated 7-10-2017 [Prashant Kumar Jaiswal v. State of U.P. Writ A No. 41750 of 2015, dated 7-10-2017 (All)] since the list was quashed only insofar as those candidates included in the merit list who did not have CCC certificate by NIELIT/DOEACC. The Division Bench in the impugned [Deepak Sharma v. State of U.P. Special Appeal No. 585 of 2018, dated 9-5-2019 (All)] has erroneously held that employer after dated 7-10-2017 [Prashant Kumar Jaiswal v. State of U.P. Writ A No. 41750 of 2015, dated 7-10-2017 (All)] did not 440 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports take into consideration the CCC certificate of DOEACC or NIELIT. The following are the observations made by the Division Bench in this regard: “… Heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the rival parties. At the threshold, it would be appropriate to state that the employer after accepting the given by the learned Single Bench has prepared a fresh select list and, while doing so, the certificate issued by DOEACC relating to “CCC” has not been taken into consideration….” 54. The Division Bench was not correct in making the above observations since neither the learned Single Judge vide its dated 7-10-2017 [Prashant Kumar Jaiswal v. State of U.P. Writ A No. 41750 of 2015, dated 7-10-2017 (All)] directed for not taking into consideration CCC certificate by DOEACC nor Corporation or Commission deleted those names from the merit list who had CCC certificate from DOEACC.” [emphasis supplied] 20. It can thus be seen that this Court has, in unequivocal terms, held that the candidates who had CCC certificate from DOEACC/ NIELIT and who were included in the merit list dated 14th July 2015 were not affected by the of the learned Single Judge dated 7th October 2017, since the list was quashed only insofar as those candidates included in the merit list who did not have CCC certificate by DOEACC/NIELIT. This Court has, in unequivocal terms, held that the learned Single Judge, vide its and dated 7th October 2017, had neither restrained the respondent- Corporation from taking into consideration the CCC certificate issued by DOEACC/NIELIT nor had it directed that the respondent- Corporation delete those names from the merit list who had CCC certificate from DOEACC/NIELIT. From paragraph 55 of the said , it would be clear that this Court was of the considered opinion that the CCC certificate as mentioned in the advertisement dated 14th September 2014 was CCC certificate as granted by DOEACC/NIELIT.
