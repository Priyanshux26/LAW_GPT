Only in that event, the will may be proved in the manner indicated in Section 69 i.e. by examining witnesses 9 Civil Appeal No. 3124/2008, dated 30.04.2008. H 244 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A who were able to prove the handwriting of the testator or executant. The burden of proof then may be shifted to others. 18. Whereas, however, a will ordinarily must be proved keeping in view the provisions of Section 63 of the Succession Act and Section 68 of the Act, in the event the ingredients thereof, as noticed B hereinbefore, are brought on record, strict proof of execution and attestation stands relaxed. However, signature and handwriting, as contemplated in Section 69, must be proved.” Section 69 was also considered in K. Laxmanan v. Thekkayil Padmini & Ors10: C “Since both the attesting witnesses have not been examined, in terms of Section 69 of the Act it was incumbent upon the Appellant to prove that the attestation of at least one attesting witness is in his handwriting and that the signature of the person executing the document is in the handwriting of that person. DW 3, who was an identifying witness also in Ext. B- D 2, specifically stated that he had not signed as an identifying witness in respect of Ext. B-2 and also that he did not know about the signature in Ext. B-2. Besides, considering the nature of the document which was a deed of gift and even assuming that no pleading is filed specifically denying the E execution of the document by the executant and, therefore, there was no mandatory requirement and obligation to get an attesting witness examined but still the fact remains that the Plaintiff never admitted the execution of the gift deed and, therefore, the same was required to be proved like any other document.” F 16.

Reverting back to Section 69 of the Evidence Act, we G are of the view that the requirement therein would be if the signature of the person executing the document is proved to be in his handwriting, then attestation of one attesting witness is to be proved to be in his handwriting. In other words, in a 10 Civil Appeal No. 7082/2008, decided on 03.12.2008. H 11 Civil Appeal No. 1021-26/2013, decided on 17.07.2020. ASHUTOSH SAMANTA (D) BY LRS. v. SM. RANJAN BALA 245 DASI [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] case covered Under Section 69 of the Evidence Act, the A requirement pertinent to Section 68 of the Evidence Act that the attestation by both the witnesses is to be proved by examining at least one attesting witness, is dispensed with. It may be that the proof given by the attesting witness, within the meaning of Section 69 of the Evidence Act, may contain B evidence relating to the attestation by the other attesting witness but that is not the same thing as stating it to be the legal requirement under the Section to be that attestation by both the witnesses is to be proved in a case covered by Section 69 of the Evidence Act.
