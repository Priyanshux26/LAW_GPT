[Para 38] Constitution of India – Art.226 – Whether the delay in disposal of the writ petition could be treated a valid ground to sustain the claim of the appellants even against the private entity: Held: The delay in disposal of the writ petitions could not have been a ground to continue with and maintain the writ petitions – Because the forum that is the High Court where the writ petitions were instituted could not have issued a writ to the private respondent which had changed hands in the intervening period – Hence, the question is also decided against the appellants.
