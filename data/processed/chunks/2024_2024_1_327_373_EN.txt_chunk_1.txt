329 All India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors the country are required to work are arduous – The work of a judicial officer is not confined merely to the working hours rendered in the course of judicial duties in the court – That apart, members of the district judiciary have wide ranging administrative functions which take place beyond working hours, especially on week-ends – Further, there is a need to maintain uniformity in the service conditions of judicial officers across the country – Thus, the plea that rules of each State must govern pay and allowances, lacks substance – Judges are not comparable with the administrative executive – They discharge sovereign state functions and just like the Council of Ministers or the political executive and their service is different from the secretarial staff or the administrative executive which carries out the decisions of the political executive, judges are distinct from judicial staff, and are thus comparable with the political executive and legislature – Wholly inappropriate to equate judicial service with the service of other officers of the State – The functions, duties, restrictions and restraints operating during and after service are entirely distinct for members of the judicial service – Plea of equivalence rejected yet again.
