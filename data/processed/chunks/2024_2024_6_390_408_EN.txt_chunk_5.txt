The finding on the title was arrived at by the learned District Judge not on the basis of any document of title but on a consideration of relevant documentary and oral evidence adduced by the parties. The learned Judge, therefore, in our opinion, clearly exceeded his jurisdiction in setting aside the said finding. The provisions of Section 100 are clear and unambiguous. As early as in 1891, the Judicial Committee in Durga Choudhrain v. Jawahir Singh Choudhri [1890 SCC OnLine PC 10 : (1889-90) 17 IA 122] stated thus : (SCC OnLine PC) ‘There is no jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal on the ground of an erroneous finding of fact, however gross or inexcusable the error may seem to be.’ The principle laid down in this decision has been followed in innumerable cases by the Privy Council as well as by different High Courts in this country. Again the Judicial Committee in Midnapur Zamindary Co. Ltd. v. Uma Charan Mandal [1923 SCC OnLine PC 31 : (1924-25) 29 CWN 131] further elucidated the principle by pointing out : (SCC OnLine PC) 398 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports ‘[If] the question to be decided is one of fact, it does not involve an issue of law merely because documents which were not instruments of title or contracts or statutes or otherwise the direct foundations of rights but were merely historical documents, have to be construed.’ Nor does the fact that the finding of the first appellate court is based upon some documentary evidence make it any the less a finding of fact (see Wali Mohammad v. Mohd. Bakhsh [1929 SCC OnLine PC 115 : (1929- 30) 57 IA 86 : ILR (1930) 11 Lah 199]). But, notwithstanding such clear and authoritative pronouncements on the scope of the provisions of Section 100 CPC, some learned Judges of the High Courts are disposing of second appeals as if they were first appeals. This introduces, apart from the fact that the High Court assumes and exercises a jurisdiction which it does not possess, a gambling element in the litigation and confusion in the mind of the litigant public. This case affords a typical illustration of such interference by a Judge of the High Court in excess of his jurisdiction under Section 100 CPC. We have, therefore, no alternative but to set aside the decree of the High Court on the simple ground that the learned Judge of the High Court had no jurisdiction to interfere in second appeal with the findings of fact given by the first appellate court based upon an appreciation of the relevant evidence. In the result, the decree of the High Court is set aside and the appeal is allowed with costs throughout.” 12. Later, in a , in Kshitish Chandra Bose v. Commr. [(1981) 2 SCC 103] — three Judges, of this Court held that the High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain second appeal on findings of fact even if it was erroneous. The Court held as follows : (SCC p. 108, para 11) [2024] 6 S.C.R.
