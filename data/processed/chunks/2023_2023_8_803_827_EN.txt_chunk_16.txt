What is, however, conspicuous by its absence is any finding by the Arbitrator, that the final bill dated H 13.02.2002 was the result of duress or any other vitiating factors. 824 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 21. Learned counsel for the respondent would point out that the dated 04.03.2009 passed by the Arbitrator under Section 16 had attained finality as the same was not impugned under Section 37 of the Act. Section 37 of the Act reads as follows: “37.Appealable s.—(1) An appeal shall lie from the following B s (and from no others) to the Court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the , namely:— (a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8; (b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9; C (c) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34.] (2) Appeal shall also lie to a court from an of the arbitral tribunal— D (a) accepting the plea referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of section 16; or (b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under section 17. (3) No second appeal shall lie from an passed in appeal E under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or takeaway any right to appeal to the Supreme Court.” 22. An appeal lies to the Court from an of the Arbitral Tribunal accepting the plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 16. This means that an appeal can be preferred against the of the F Arbitral Tribunal allowing the plea that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction. Similar is the case with reference to an which is rendered appealable under Section 16(3) of the Act. Thereunder also, it is the plea that the Arbitral Tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority which is allowed which is rendered appealable. In this case, by G dated 04.03.2009, the Arbitral Tribunal has not allowed the plea be it under section 16(2) or under Section 16(3). On the other hand, the Tribunal has rejected admittedly the plea of the appellants. Therefore, no appeal could have been filed under Section 37 against the dated 04.03.2009. An passed by the Arbitral Tribunal rejecting the plea under Section 16(2) or 16(3) being part of the Award itself, it is open to the parties to H challenge the same when a petition is filed under Section 34 of the Act UNION OF INDIA & ORS. v. M/S. BHARAT ENTERPRISE 825 [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] challenging the Award. This is the scheme of the Act. This is apparently A to confine a right to appeal to those cases where accepting a plea of a party would bring the arbitration to a halt. In fact, we notice that the dated 04.03.2009 has been referred to in the Award and it has been treated as part of the Award. 23. It is thereafter that in a proceeding that the District Court has B allowed the petition filed under Section 34 by the appellants.
