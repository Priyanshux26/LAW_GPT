Therefore, an explanation of the appellant was called for. We fail to understand how the appellant committed acts of indiscipline or contempt by not following the suggestion incorporated in paragraph 9. Secondly, even assuming that the appellant was guilty of indiscipline, on the judicial side, the High Court ought not to have passed an calling for an explanation from a judicial officer. The direction of calling for an explanation from a judicial officer by a judicial [2024] 12 S.C.R. 689 Ayub Khan v. The State of Rajasthan was inappropriate. Explanation of a judicial officer can be called for only on the administrative side. The High Court carried the matter further. By dated 25th April 2023, the High Court directed the appellant to send a list of the total number of bail applications he disposed of in February 2023, along with copies of the s passed by him. He was also directed to submit a report on whether directions contained in the case of Jugal Kishore1 were followed by him. The appellant was forced to give a reply and was left with no choice but to tender an apology by submitting the reply. With the utmost respect to the High Court, undertaking such an exercise was a waste of precious judicial time of the High Court which has a huge pendency. 14. What the High Court has done while deciding a bail petition in a case where bail was denied by the appellant as a Session Judge was completely uncalled for. The entire exercises done by the High Court right from issuing directions in the case of Jugal Kishore1 and passing s dated 4th April 2023, 25th April 2023 and the impugned by which the High Court found fault with the appellant was not only unwarranted but illegal. 15. As noted earlier, in the and dated 18th June 2021 in S.B. Criminal Misc. Interim Bail Application No.6821/2021, in paragraphs 13 to 16 and in particular paragraph 15, similar directions were issued which are issued in the case of Jugal Kishore,1 and by dated 20th February 2023, the said directions have been set aside by this Court in Special Leave Petition (Crl.) Nos.11675-11676 of 2022 (Rajasthan High Court v. State of Rajasthan and Anr.). 16. Therefore, to conclude, we hold that the directions issued in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the decision of the Rajasthan High Court in the case of Jugal Kishore1 cannot be said to be binding directions. At the highest, the same shall be treated as suggestions made by the High Court. Non compliance with what is observed in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the said decision by a judicial officer cannot be treated as an act of indiscipline or contempt. 17. Injustice has been done to the appellant by passing the s which we have referred to above. Before we part with this , we may refer to a decision of this Court in the case of Sonu Agnihotri.2 In paragraphs nos. 15 and 16, this Court held thus: 690 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
