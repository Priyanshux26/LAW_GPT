It is also intended that in the intervening period of 10 years, these persons should not suffer from any other disability vis-a-vis citizens, excepting the right to vote and that proper record should be maintained of such persons. To inspire confidence, judicial element should be associated to determine eligibility in each and every case under this category. The Bill seeks to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 to achieve the above objectives.” (Emphasis supplied) 92. The Preamble to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1985 reads as follows: - 1178 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “THE CITIZENSHIP (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1985 No. 65 of 1985 [7th December, 1985] An Act further to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955. Whereas for the purpose of giving effect to certain provisions of the Memorandum of Settlement relating to the foreigners’ issue in Assam (Assam Accord) which was laid before the Houses of Parliament on the 16th day of August, 1985 it is necessary to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955; BE it enacted by Parliament in the Thirty-sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows” 93. A perusal of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act,69 more particularly the use of the words “Special provisions” and “Assam Accord ” in the marginal note makes it abundantly clear that the said provision was in the nature of a special provision pertaining to citizenship and was intended only for a limited class of persons in Assam who were covered by the Assam Accord which, as stated earlier, was a political settlement meant to tackle the exigencies prevailing in the State of Assam at the time of signing of the Accord. 94. A close reading of Section 6A reveals that the benefit of citizenship to the immigrants from Bangladesh, as envisaged under the Assam Accord, has been conferred under the said provision in two distinct ways. 95. First, Section 6A sub-section (2) provides that persons of Indian origin who came into Assam from the territories now part of Bangladesh before 01.01.1966 and subsequent to their entry have been ordinarily resident in Assam are deemed to be citizens of India. 69 6A. Special provisions as to citizenship of persons covered by the Assam Accord. — (1) For the purposes of this section — (a) “Assam” means the territories included in the State of Assam immediately before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amend-ment) Act, 1985; (b) “detected to be a foreigner” means detected to be a foreigner in accordance with the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 (31 of 1946) and the Foreigners (Tribunals) , 1964 by a Trib-unal constituted under the said ; [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1179 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 96. In other words, immigrants falling under the aforesaid category are automatically conferred citizenship by virtue of a legal fiction. For an immigrant to be entitled to the benefits under sub-section (2), the following requirements have been prescribed: - (c) “specified territory” means the territories included in Bangladesh immediately before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1985; (d) a person shall be deemed to be of Indian origin, if he, or either of his parents for any of his grandparents was born in undivided India; (e) a person shall be deemed to have been detected to be a for-eigner on the date on which a Tribunal constituted under the Foreigners (Tribunals) , 1964 submits its opinion to the effect that he is a foreigner to the officer or authority concerned.
