It was submitted that the Lenders are relying on the RFRP to claim that no adjustment of the PBG was possible. However, the RFRP is only a wish list of the CoC which was informed to the applicants at the time of inviting plans. Therefore, it cannot override a negotiated and approved provision of the Resolution Plan. This is precisely why the approved Resolution Plans often deviate from the RFRP. 64. The counsel submitted that according to Clause 6.4.4 of the Resolution Plan, the Balance Security is in the form of immovable properties located in Dubai and since they are located outside India, the approval of the RBI was necessary for the creation of security. The security on the Dubai properties of the SRA was to be created on the Effective Date, i.e., 20.05.2022. On 21.05.2022, a day after the Effective Date, the SBI had applied for the approval and the same was received on 22.07.2022. 65. It was submitted that, on 03.02.2023 the SRA had shared drafts of the transaction documents required for the creation of security. However, no comments were received from the Appellants. It is the case of the SRA that the Appellants did not reply to the reminder emails sent between the months of May and October 2023 and this issue was also discussed during the 37th MC Meeting dated 09.10.2023. However, after more than a year of sharing the transaction documents, the Appellants sent their comments on the same on 08.04.2024 i.e., three days before the expiry of the 30-day timeline given under the impugned of the NCLAT. 66. It was further submitted that, only in the 42nd MC Meeting that took place on 02.04.2024 the SRA was informed for the first time that, as per the recent valuation, the valuation of the Balance Security worked out at Rs. 236 Crore and that there was a shortfall of Rs. 14 Crores. In the same meeting, the SRA suggested that a property in India valued at Rs. 250 Crore could be provided as an alternate security. Vide email dated 10.04.2024, the SRA provided details of the alternate security equivalent to Rs. 250 Crore in India. However, the 2102 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Appellants responded to the above vide their email dated 16.04.2024 stating that providing an alternate security would tantamount to modification of the Resolution Plan. 67. The counsel submitted that the SRA, vide email dated 16.04.2024 conveyed that they had not received any invoice from Mashreq Bank towards payment of their costs for acting as an agent for security creation and that the payment of security related costs to the extent of Rs. 76 Lakh could be done from the existing deposit with the Appellants. For the balance amounts, they requested that the invoices be shared with the SRA and that the same would be processed immediately. On 20.04.2024 and 01.05.2024 respectively, the SRA reminded the Appellants to share the invoices for the purpose of security creation. 68. On the issue of security creation, the counsel summed up submitting that the SRA had done everything within its control to enable the Appellants to create security including agreeing to bear all costs and expenses for creation and preservation of security, providing contracts for such security creation, and providing title documents of all the immovable properties to the Appellants.
