Furthermore, in the present case the terms of auction sale provided that the assets were sold on “as is where is and whatever there is’’ basis. In the light of the clear facts, the respondent would be well within its right to demand the electricity arrears due, from the appellant-purchaser. Since KSEB’s C claim petition was admitted for Rs 63,94,298 the amount remitted, if any, by the appellant to whom connection has been effected would be adjusted in accordance with Clause 15(e). 156. We hold that the decision of the High Court does not call for interference. The appeal is therefore dismissed. D Item 101: K.C. Ninan v. Kerala State Electricity Board; Civil Appeal No. 2109-2110 of 2004 157. The appellant purchased the property of United Industries Cochin Ltd in a court auction on 31 October 1989. The electricity connection of the premises was earlier disconnected in 1980 and the E electric supply line was dismantled in 1985 on account of non-payment of electricity charges. On 1 December 1989, the appellant allegedly applied to KSEB for an electric connection to the purchased premises. Subsequently, on 1 January 1990, Clause 15 of the Conditions of Supply of electrical energy was effectuated. On 12 June 1990, the KSEB sent a communication to the appellant, refusing to grant an electric connection F unless the appellant paid the arrears of electricity of the premises. As a consequence, the appellant filed a writ petition seeking a permanent electrical connection and challenging Clause 15(e) of the Conditions of Supply. 158. The High Court in the judgement dated 13 February 2003 G relied on KJ Dennis (supra)and A Ramachandran (supra), and rejected the prayer of the auction purchaser to get an electricity connection without paying the dues of the previous owner to the KSEB. The appellant filed a review petition against the judgement dated 13 February 2003. It was the appellant’s contention that the decisions in Ramachandran (supra)and H K. C. NINAN v. KERALA STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD & 723 ORS. [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] KJ Dennis (supra) are inapplicable to the facts of the case. The A appellant submitted that the “judgement under review was delivered without taking note of the fact that condition 15(e) was incorporated in the Conditions of Supply of Electrical Energy only with effect from 1.1.1990 while the petitioner purchased the property on 31.10.1989 in a Court auction and the application for electric connection was made on B 1.12.1989.” The review petition filed by the appellant was dismissed on the ground that the High Court’s decision in Ramachandran (supra) took into consideration the ratio in Isha Marbles (supra)and thereafter upheld the action taken by the respondent-Board. 159. This Court issued notice on 7 January 2004, and granted C leave on 2 April 2004. Recovery proceedings were stayed on 5 May 2006. 160. The appellant has submitted in the course of the written submissions that the impugned regulation would apply prospectively as subordinate legislation made by a delegate cannot have retrospective D effect unless rule making power in the concerned statute expressly or by necessary implication confers power in this behalf.75 It was further stated that the appellant had applied for electricity connection on 1 December 1989, before the Conditions of Supply came into force.
