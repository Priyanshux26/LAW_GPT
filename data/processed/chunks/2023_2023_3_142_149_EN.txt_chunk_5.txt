Two other witnesses were also examined in support of D the last seen theory but they also do not inspire any confidence. 20. Insofar as the recoveries are concerned which again is an important link in the chain of circumstances, the recoveries have been from an open place. The dragging of some heavy object from the place where the blood-stains were noticed and ‘vojali’ was recovered, up to E the edge of the river and then recovering the motor bike from the place from the bed of the river just below where the dragging marks had come to an end is something quite normal and expected. It was not a place which could be in the exclusive knowledge of the appellant. 21. The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence and F especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful. In view of the discussion made above, we do not find any corroborating evidence to support the extra-judicial confession, rather the evidence led by prosecution is inconsistent with the same. G 22. In view of the discussion made above, we find that the major links of the chain of circumstances have not been proved by the prosecution evidence and as such it would be unjust to uphold the conviction of the appellant. The appellant would be entitled to benefit of doubt. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the appellant is acquitted H INDRAJIT DAS v. THE STATE OF TRIPURA 149 [VIKRAM NATH, J.] of all the charges. Appellant is in judicial custody. However, he was A granted parole by the State. He shall be released forthwith. 23. Pending applications, if any, are disposed of. Nidhi Jain Appeal allowed.
