On 06.12.2023, the 10 FIR No. 29 dated 03.02.2022, at P.S.

Digital Supreme Court Reports learned counsel for the appellant pointed out that during the pendency of the present matter before this Court, the High Court vide dated 11.10.2023 had granted bail to the appellant. As he did not have hard copy of the passed by the High Court, he placed before us a soft copy of the said through his mobile phone. On a reading of the aforesaid , this Court found that the same neither mentioned the fact that it was the second bail application14 filed by the appellant nor pendency of the SLP before this Court, in which notice had already been issued. Taking the matter seriously and deprecating such a practice this Court passed the following on 06.12.2023: “This petition has been filed assailing the correctness of dated 6th March, 2023 passed by the High Court of Orissa at Cuttack in BLAPL No. 1855 of 2022, ‘Kusha Duruka Versus State of Odisha’ whereby the prayer for bail was rejected. Notice was issued by this Court on 22nd September, 2023. Today the learned counsel for the petitioner informs this Court that during the pendency of this petition, the High Court has granted bail to the petitioner on 11th October, 2023. He has placed before us a soft copy of the said through his mobile, according to which BLAPL No. 10860 of 2023 was allowed apparently on the ground of parity extended to another co-accused. From reading of the said , we find that it neither mentions that it was the second bail application filed by the petitioner before the High Court nor does it reflects any reference to the petition pending before this Court in which notice had already been issued in September, 2023. We seriously deprecate such practice by the litigant and the counsel. 14 BLAPL No.
