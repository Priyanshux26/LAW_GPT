v. Union of India and Ors. (2016) 13 SCC 153 : [2016] 3 F SCR 407; Siddaraju v. State of Karnataka and Ors. (2020) 19 SCC 572; State of Kerala and Ors. v. Leesamma Joseph (2021) 9 SCC 208; A.I. Confederation of the Blind v. Union of India & Anr. (2014) 15 SCC 481; Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992) 3 Supp SCC 217 : [1992] 2 Suppl. SCR 454 – G referred to. Per S. Ravindra Bhat J: (Supplementing) HELD: 1.1 The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunity, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 did not contain a provision for reservations in ‘promotions’ for H 782 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A persons with disabilities appointees, unlike its successor enactment, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, which enabled the State to do the same. Section 33 of the 1995 Act only provided for 3% reservation for posts identified under Section 32, with 1% each for persons suffering from (i) blindness or low vision; (ii) hearing impairment; and (iii) locomotor disability B or cerebral palsy. There is no mention of this extending to promotions. In the absence of such statutory power, its inclusion in the extant provisions by this Court is not beyond doubt. It cannot be said that the manner in which such reservations have been granted in promotions-even if horizontally-as a matter of C right, is not contrary to the express prohibition of the same by the nine judges in Indra Sawhney’s case. Therefore, there is serious reservation in its interpretation otherwise. [Para 10][820- G; 821-A-B] 1.2 While Indra Sawhney’s case no doubt pertained to D vertical reservations for backward classes of citizens. It cannot be said that its operative portion on reservations in promotions is inapplicable to other classes of citizens on that front alone. Such an exercise of distinguishing its application misses the crux of its reasoning – that while provision of reservations in initial appointments furthers the mandate of substantive equality, its E application to promotions militates against the same mandate. It was not the intention of Article 16 of the Constitution to compromise on administrative inefficiency by culling the spirit of competition-after all, positions gained by promotions taper higher up. To ear-mark a certain portion to one class of citizens, and not F others, who may have also gained initial appointments on the strength of such horizontality (such as women, retired / ex- servicemen, etc.) is not constitutionally protected-the only exception to reservations in promotions is SC/ST appointees, as provided under Article 16(4A). [Para 11][821-C-E] G 1.3 Horizontal reservations, unlike their vertical counterparts, are not rigid, but have fluidity to them. A candidate eligible for horizontal reservation is not coffined to their vertical category. Migrations are permissible to allow the best candidates to emerge from this interlocking framework for reservations. However, such a mechanism is unworkable in promotions, where H RESERVE BANK OF INDIA & ORS. v. A.K. NAIR & ORS. 783 vertical and horizontal qualifiers are absent (barring those for A SC/ST candidate.
