If the respondent no.1 would have approached the DRT against the e-auction notice he would have been non–suited in view of the earlier passed by the DRT dated 24.08.2016. Therefore, F calculatively the respondent no.1 filed the writ petition before the High Court challenging the e-auction notice and that too after conducting of the e– auction on 31.08.2016 and the sale in favour of the appellant was confirmed. The said facts were pointed out before the High Court and despite the same the G High Court has allowed the writ petition which is not sustainable at all. By the impugned the respondent no.1 has got the relief which as such the borrower failed to get from the DRT. On the said grounds the impugned and passed by the High Court is unsustainable. [Para 8.2][636-B-H; 637-A] H G. VIKRAM KUMAR v. STATE BANK OF HYDERABAD & 627 ORS. 1.3 In the present case the borrower failed to get any A relief from the DRT. The borrower did not apply and/or invoke Section 13(8) and did not agree to clear the entire dues. Therefore, also the High Court has materially erred in allowing the writ petition. [Para 8.3][637-C] 1.4 What exact relief is granted by the High Court is not B clear. The High Court has simply stated that the writ petition is allowed. However, it is required to be noted that what was challenged. Even at the time when the respondent no.1 entered into the agreement to sale/MoU he was aware about the proceedings pending before the DRT before the High Court C was the e-auction notice dated 28.07.2016 which was already conducted on 31.08.2016. Therefore, the writ petition was filed much after conducting the e-auction on 31.08.2016. No consequential relief has been granted by the High Court. Therefore, also the impugned and passed by the High Court is unsustainable. [Para 8.4][637-D-E] D 1.5 Now so far as the submission the respondent no.1 has paid/deposited the amount of sale consideration and now the respondent no.1 has died his heirs will have to vacate the flat in question and on the other hand the appellant shall be entitled to return the amount of Rs.6,45,250/ deposited at the E relevant time being 25% of the auction sale consideration with interest is concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that as such the transaction between the respondent no.1 and the borrower pursuant to the agreement to sale dated 16.06.2016 was absolutely illegal and behind the back of the F tribunal as well as the Bank and during the pendency of the proceedings before the tribunal. In dated 24.08.2016 the tribunal had in fact already held the sale transaction as void. Even at the time when the respondent no.1 entered into the agreement to sale/MoU he was aware about the proceedings pending before the DRT which is apparent from Clause 4 of G the MoU . Therefore, respondent no.1 and/or his heirs cannot be permitted to get the benefit of his own wrong and cannot be permitted to get the benefit of a void transaction.
