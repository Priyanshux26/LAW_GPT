Nov. 2022 Contract Agreement was signed between Respondent 1 & 2. Work started. 12.12.2022 The Appellant filed the SLP challenging the impugned dated 18.10.2022 and the Court while issuing notice, granted stay of operation of the impugned dated 18.10.2022. 4. The question that has been posed before us in the instant appeal is, whether the High Court could have disposed of the CWP filed by the respondent no. 2 by simply accepting the statements made on behalf of the learned advocates for the respondent no. 1 and respondent no. 2, virtually permitting the respondent no.1 HIMUDA to withdraw the cancellation of initial tendering process dated 05.02.2021 and permitting the respondent no. 2 M/s Vasu Constructions to execute the project on the same terms and conditions and at the rates as per the initial tender dated 15.11.2018, though the said tender was already withdrawn by the Respondent No.1 HIMUDA in view of the report made by the independent Committee constituted by the High Court confirming gross irregularities and illegalities committed by the officers of [2024] 4 S.C.R. 9 Level 9 Biz Pvt. Ltd. v. Himachal Pradesh Housing and Urban Development Authority & Another HIMUDA and in view of the dated 08.01.2021 passed by the Single Bench? 5. As could be seen from the chronology of events, the appellant and the respondent No. 2 were declared qualified in the Technical Bids opened on 15.12.2018 and on the same day, the financial bid of the said two parties were also opened. The respondent no.2 being L-1, the Letter of Intent dated 17.12.2018 was issued by the Respondent No.1 in favour of the respondent no.2. Subsequently, an unsuccessful bidder M/s Dalip Singh Rathore filed a writ petition being No. 3021/2018 in the High Court, alleging irregularities and illegalities in the tender process and challenging the eligibility of the respondent no. 2, also seeking cancellation of the Tender. The appellant also filed CWP No. 363/2019 praying for the rejection of the Technical and Financial Bids of the respondent no.2. The respondent no.1 HIMUDA in the meantime appointed a committee on 01.01.2019 to review the tender process. The respondent no.1 also vide the letter dated 02.01.2019 withdrew the Letter of Intent issued in favour of the respondent no.2. Subsequently, the High Court also appointed an Independent Committee to look into the alleged illegalities and irregularities vide the dated 25.11.2020, in to instill confidence in the general public and to ensure transparency in the system. 6. As transpiring from the dated 08.01.2021, the said Independent Committee submitted the report, arriving at a definite conclusion that the officers responsible for evaluation of the tender had not acted responsibly and fairly, as a consequence of which both M/s Vasu Constructions Company (respondent no.2 herein) and M/s Level 9 Biz Pvt. Ltd. (the appellant herein) were wrongly declared eligible in the Technical Bid. The Committee had concluded that since both the bidders were not technically qualified as per the terms and conditions of the NIT, the tender needed to be cancelled.
