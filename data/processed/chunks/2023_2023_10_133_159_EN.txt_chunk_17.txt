This letter virtually became the gateway for a review of the entire system of allocation. Clearly, the GOI had altered its position, within five weeks, because in the dated 02.05.2020, in an application E moved by Sanvira, in the pending writ petition, its position, through the statement of its counsel, was that there was no change in the allocation method, by the public notice of 17.04.2020: “4. Ms. Maninder Acharya, learned ASG submitted that repeatedly the applicant/petitioner has been seeking the same F relief which was denied to it by the Supreme Court and not only the instant application but the writ petition itself was an abuse of the process of the court. The learned ASG submitted that merely because a public notice was issued, no fresh cause of action accrued in favour of the applicant/petitioner and G its grievance, if any could be redressed only by approaching the Supreme Court.” 27. Despite the above statement, the Minutes of the meeting dated 03.06.2020, treated the letter of 04.05.2020 (by APPCB) as if Sanvira’s original capacity was 3,30,000 MTPA, ignoring the consistent H 158 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A position, whereby its claims to that effect were rejected about five times previously. Keeping this background, the single judge concluded as follows: “37. A reading of the above Public Notices would show the marked departure made in the Public Notice dated 17.04.2020. While in terms of the Public Notices dated 26.11.2018 and B 22.03.2019, the eligible entities were to produce “capacity of the unit and a valid consent certificate from SPCB/PCC”, in terms of Public Notice dated 17.04.2020, the eligible entities were to produce “State Pollution Control Board Certificate indicating capacity of the unit as on 09.10.2018 and also valid consent certificate from SPCB/PCC”. Therefore, while C under .the Public Notices dated 26.11.2018 and 22.03.2019, the applicant was to produce documents showing its Production capacity, in the Public Notice dated 17.04.2020, only a Certificate from the State Pollution Control Board indicating capacity of the unit as on 09.10.2018 could suffice. D No other document for supporting claim of Production Capacity as on 09.10.2018 could have been taken into account in terms of the Public Notice dated 17.04.2020.” 28. The reasoning of the impugned is that there was no distinction (contrary to the conclusion of the single judge) regarding the E public notice dated 17.04.2020 -between the certificate in the first part and the consent to operate in the second part. The Division Bench noted, correctly that the annual total limit of import of 1.4 Million Metric Tonnes was based on the total production capacity as on 09.10.2018 which had been fixed by this court on the basis of the capacity disclosed by all the calciners. It was also observed that an SPCB could indicate the F permissible limit of production of calcined petroleum coke. For Sanvira it was 2,00,000 MTPA; the consent to produce 3,30,000 MTPA of coke was given only after 29th November 2018. Therefore, it could not have been considered by the court.
