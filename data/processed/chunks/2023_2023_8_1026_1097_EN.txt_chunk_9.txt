E The points that the respondents are canvasing in this case, have nothing to do with those two issues. Therefore, the accused cannot have a piggyback ride on the review petition. In fact, as we have pointed out elsewhere, the accused have not come up with any appeal challenging the of the High Court dated 01.09.2022. Therefore, they are entitled at the maximum, to argue only for F the dismissal of the appeals filed by ED and others against the said decision. Suppose we agree with the learned counsel for the accused and dismiss the appeals filed by ED, even then they cannot have an escape route since the impugned of the High Court protects them only till the other proceedings are kept G at bay. Therefore, the accused is not entitled at all either to seek a reference to a larger Bench or to seek to defer the matter till a decision is rendered in the matters involving larger issues. In view of the above, the appeals arising out of the of the Division Bench of the High Court are liable to be allowed. H 1038 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A Accordingly, these appeals are allowed and the of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated 01.09.2022 is set aside. ED will now be entitled to proceed further from the stage at which their hands were tied by the impugned . [Paras 116-119][1093-A-F] B Vijay Madanlal Choudhary vs. Union of India 2022 SCC OnLine SC 929 – referred to. 10. The grievance of the appellant in this appeal is that the High Court has overlooked the provisions of Rule 231(3) of the Rules, 2019 and also Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, C 1872. But both the above contentions are without substance. Rule 231 primarily deals with the grant of certified copies of certain other documents to the accused, before filing of the Final Report. Rule 231(3) states that certified copies of unmarked documents shall not be given. The High Court has not passed any directing the grant of certified copies of unmarked documents. D All that the High Court has done is permitting the ED to have an inspection of the documents under Rule 237 and thereafter to file a proper copy application. This is not contrary to Rule 231(3). We do not know how an argument revolving around Section 65B of the Evidence Act is raised. Section 65B concerns the E admissibility of electronic records. Without certification, ED may not be able to use those electronic records in evidence, in the prosecution under PMLA. But it does not mean that they cannot even have a look at the electronic record. Therefore, we find no merits in the appeal. Hence, the appeal challenging the of the High Court dated 30.03.2022 passed in Criminal O.P. No.5726 F of 2022 is dismissed. [Paras 122-124][1094-C-F] 11. The appeals arising out of the for de novo investigation are allowed. That portion of the of the High Court dated 31.10.2022 passed in Criminal O.P.
