[Para 5.3][53-B-C] 3. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid D two decisions to the facts of the case on hand, the court is of the opinion that in the present case while allowing the review application and setting aside the and dated 03.03.2017 passed in Writ Petition No.8606 of 2010 the High Court has exceeded in its jurisdiction and has exercised the jurisdiction not vested in it while exercising the review E jurisdiction under 47 Rule 1 read with Section 114 CPC. From the reasoning given by the High Court, it appears that according to the High Court the and passed in Writ Petition No.8606 of 2010 was erroneous. While passing the impugned and the High Court has observed and F considered the Survey Report dated 12.12.2007 which was already dealt with by the High Court while deciding the main writ petition and the High Court discarded and/or not considered the Survey Report dated 12.12.2007. Once the Survey Report dated 12.12.2007 fell for consideration before the High Court while deciding the main writ petition thereafter the same could not have G been considered again by the High Court while deciding the review application.
