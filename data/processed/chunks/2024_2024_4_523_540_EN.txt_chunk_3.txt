He further submitted that the election is also liable to be set aside on the ground of the appellant having indulged into corrupt practices, he having failed to make the disclosures as required by the RP Act and by the judicial pronouncements by this Court. According to him, the RP Act was amended with effect from 24.08.2002 incorporating therein Section 33A in the RP Act and incorporating Rule 4A in the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 with effect from 03.09.2002, prescribing the form of affidavit to be filed by the candidate at the time of delivering the nomination paper in Form-26 to the said Rules. In Lok Prahari vs. Union of India & Others2, this Court 1 [2023] 4 SCR 798 : 2023 SCC Online SC 573 2 (2018) 4 SCC 699 528 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports has held that non-disclosure would amount to “undue influence” as defined in the RP Act. Further relying on the decision in case of Krishnamoorthy vs. Sivakumar and Others3, he submitted that if the “corrupt practice” is alleged under Section 100(1)(b), it is not necessary to state that the “corrupt practice” has materially affected the outcome of the election. Lastly, he submitted that there are number of triable issues involved in the Election Petition, and the cause of action also having been disclosed in the Election Petition, the High Court has rightly rejected the application of the appellant under VII Rule 11, CPC, which being just and legal, this Court may not interfere with the same. 8.
