Such discharge and signing of letter of subrogation was voluntary and free from any coercion or undue influence. In the circumstances, we hold that upon execution of the letter of subrogation, there was full 876 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and final settlement of the claim. Since our answer to the question, whether there was really accord and satisfaction, is in the affirmative, in our view no arbitrable dispute existed so as to exercise power Under Section 11 of the Act. The High Court was not therefore justified in exercising power Under Section 11 of the Act.” (Emphasis supplied) 73. The net effect of the decisions in SBP & Co. (supra) and Boghara Polyfab (supra) was that the scope for interference available to the referral courts when acting under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 was substantially expanded. The referral courts were conferred with the discretion to conduct mini trials and indulge in the appreciation of evidence on the issues concerned with the subject matter of arbitration. The Law Commission of India in its 246th report took note of the issue of significant delays being caused to the arbitral process due to enlarged scope of judicial interference at the stage of appointment of arbitrator and suggested as follows: i. First, that the power of appointment conferred upon the Chief Justice be devolved on to the Supreme Court and the High Court, as the case may be; and ii. Secondly, the power of appointment under Section 11 be clarified to be an administrative power and not a judicial one. iii. Thirdly, the scope of interference under Sections 8 and 11 respectively of the Act, 1996 be restricted only to those cases where the court finds that no arbitration agreement exists or is null and void. 74.

The aforesaid recommendations of the Commission were taken note of by the Parliament and accordingly the Act, 1996 was amended in 2015 to incorporate Section 11(6-A), which reads thus: “(6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under sub- section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6), shall, notwithstanding any , decree or of any Court, confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.” [2024] 7 S.C.R. 877 SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Krish Spinning 75. Interestingly, Section 11(6-A) was omitted by the 2019 amendment to the Act, 1996 on the basis of a report of the High-Level Committee to Review the Institutionalisation of Arbitration Mechanism in India. However, in the absence of the omission being notified, Section 11(6-A) of the Act, 1996 continues to remain on the statute book and thus has to be given effect as such. 76. The impact of the addition of Section 11(6-A) was elaborately discussed by this Court in Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd reported in (2017) 9 SCC 729 as follows: “48. […] From a reading of Section 11(6-A), the intention of the legislature is crystal clear i.e.
