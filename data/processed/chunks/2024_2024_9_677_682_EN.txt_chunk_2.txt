4. Admittedly, Moti Lal was the owner of the property in question. Son of Moti Lal, i.e., Ram Sevak had predeceased him and when Moti Lal died intestate on 08.02.1982, his widow Gomti Bai and Meera Devi, his daughter-in-law (widow of Ram Sevak), inherited the property in question. One Pramod Kumar Pandey staked his claim in the property in question through an unregistered Will6 allegedly made by Late Moti Lal in his favour. Gomti Bai and Meera Devi filed a suit7 seeking declaration that the unregistered Will is fake, illegal and void, and Pramod Kumar Pandey has no right on the basis of the said Will in the property in question. The suit was decreed in favour of Gomti Bai and Meera Devi whereby the Court pronounced that Late Moti Lal died intestate on 08.02.1982 leaving behind Gomti Bai and Meera Devi as his legal heirs, and the alleged unregistered Will is forged, fabricated, illegal and void, and Pramod Kumar Pandey does not have any right in the property in question. Consequently, Gomti Bai and Meera Devi became owners of the property in question. So, ownership of the appellant-landlady is not in dispute. 5. A perusal of the paperbook shows that notice was issued on 02.01.2014 in the Special Leave Petition.8 Vide dated 02.05.2014, leave was granted and a perusal of the same shows that during the pendency of the appeal the respondent- tenant was directed to pay rent at the rate of ₹4,000/- per month. The basis therefor was that during the pendency of the Writ Petition before the High Court, an interim 9 was passed directing the respondent-tenant to pay the rent at the rate of ₹4,000/- per month. The said was challenged before this Court and upheld vide dated 11.12.2006 passed in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 19859 of 2006. 6 Dated 04.02.1982 7 Original Suit No. 278 of 1986 8 Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 24655 of 2012 9 Dated 18.10.2006 [2024] 9 S.C.R. 681 Meera Devi (D) Thr. Lr. v. Dinesh Chandra Joshi (D) Thr. Lrs. 6. The dated 02.05.2014 is extracted below : “Leave granted. We notice that by dated 18.10.2006, the Allahabad High Court had directed the respondent to pay rent at the rate of ₹4,000/- (Rupees four thousand only) per month. The said was carried in appeal to this Court and this Court vide dated 11.12.2006 dismissed the special leave petition. We, therefore, direct the respondent to pay rent at the rate of ₹4,000/- per month to the petitioner during the pendency of this appeal.” 7. When the matter was taken up before this Court for final disposal, Shobha Devi Tripathi, daughter and legal representative of Late Meera Devi, filed an affidavit dated 21.02.2024. In paragraph 3 thereof, it has been specifically mentioned that though initially the respondent-tenant paid the amount fixed by this Court but he has not paid the same from March 2017 onwards. Even though the original respondent-tenant has expired, his legal representatives who are on record, are also neither paying the rent fixed by this Court nor handing over the vacant possession of the property in question to the appellant-landlady.
