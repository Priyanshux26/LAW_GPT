5. Shri Naidu submits that the appellants before this Court had no active role to play. It is submitted that the Appellant No.1 (Accused No.3) is the wife of Accused No.2 and Appellant No.2 (Accused No.4) is the wife of Accused No.1. It is submitted that even from the perusal of the chargesheet it would reveal that no active role is attributed to the present appellants. 6. Shri Naidu further submits that in the proceedings before the DRT, the matter has been amicably settled between the respondent No.2 Bank and the accused persons. It is submitted that in addition to the total amount paid by the borrowers to the tune of Rs. 7,78,25,143/- , the Bank has also realized an amount of Rs. 1,07,54,000/- by auctioning the mortgaged properties. 7. It is further submitted that during the pendency of OA before the DRT, in view of OTS an amount of Rs. 3,80,00,000/- was also paid [2024] 10 S.C.R. 655 K. Bharthi Devi and Anr. v. State of Telangana and Anr. to the respondent No.2 Bank and as such, the respondent No.2 Bank has closed the loan account. The learned Senior Counsel, therefore, submits that the continuance of the proceedings against the appellants would be an exercise in futility. 8. Shri Naidu in support of his submissions relied on the following s of this Court in the cases of: (i) Central Bureau of Investigation, SPE, SIU (X), New Delhi v. Duncans Agro Industries Ltd., Calcutta;1 (ii) Nikhil Merchant v. Central Bureau of Investigation and another;2 (iii) Gian Singh v.

Mr. Himanshu Munshi, learned counsel for the respondent No.2 Bank confirms the fact regarding the settlement entered into between the Bank and the borrowers. 10. Shri Vikramjeet Banerjee, learned ASG, appearing on behalf of the CBI, however, submits that merely because the matter is settled between the Bank and the borrowers, it does not absolve the accused persons of their criminal liability. It is submitted that the learned judge of the High Court has rightly, upon consideration 1 [1996] Supp. 3 SCR 360 : (1996) 5 SCC 591 2 [2008] 12 SCR 236 : (2008) 9 SCC 677 3 [2012] 8 SCR 753 : (2012) 10 SCC 303 4 [2014] 3 SCR 444 : (2014) 5 SCC 364 5 [2014] 4 SCR 1012 : (2014) 6 SCC 466 6 [2014] 7 SCR 677 : (2014) 15 SCC 235 7 [2017] 1 SCR 907 : (2017) 5 SCC 350 656 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
