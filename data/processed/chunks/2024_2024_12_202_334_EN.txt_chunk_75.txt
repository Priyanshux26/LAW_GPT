(ii) This Court in Canon India (supra) made a determination of fact that the DRI officers did not have jurisdiction to perform functions under Section 28 of the Act, 1962. Such judicial determination of fact relating to actual exercise of jurisdiction cannot be retrospectively overruled. (iii) The legislature has selectively adhered to the legal findings made in Canon India (supra) only for future actions by enactment of Section 110AA and has proceeded to ignore the findings for past show cause notices by validating the same vide Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022. Such a distinction creates two classes of assessees without any reasonable basis for this differentiation. (iv) Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022 fails the test of proportionality as it is a sweeping validation of all acts under the chapters specified in the section and does not provide certainty to the assessees as to which rights have been abrogated. (v) The writ petitioner in the WP (C) No. 520 of 2022 titled Dish TV India Ltd. v. Union of India and Ors. has also challenged the application of Section 97 on the ground that Section 97(iii) of the Finance Act, 2022 gives the amendments made to Sections 2, 3 and 5 retrospective effect which would make sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 5 applicable to the show cause notices issued [2024] 12 S.C.R. 319 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. in the past. It is the case of the writ petitioner that Customs Notifications Nos. 44/2011 dated 06.07.2011 and 40/2012 dated 02.05.2012 do not in any way satisfy the mandatory and salutary criteria laid down in Sections 5(4) and 5(5). 159. From the grounds summarized above, we find that the writ petitioners have challenged the constitutionality of the validation of past actions by Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022. Therefore, we shall limit our ruling to this provision alone. 160. It is a settled position of law that the legislature is empowered to enact validating legislations to validate earlier acts declared illegal and unconstitutional by courts by removing the defect or lacuna which led to the invalidation of the law. With the removal of the defect or lacuna resulting in the validation of any act held invalid by a competent court, the act may become valid, if the validating law is lawfully enacted. 161. This Court in the case of Empire Industries Ltd. v. Union of India reported in (1985) 3 SCC 314 observed that: “51. In the view we have taken of the expression “manufacture”, the concept of process being embodied in certain situation in the idea of manufacture, the impugned legislation is only making “small repairs” and that is a permissible mode of legislation. In 73rd vol. of Harvard Law Review p. 692 at p. 795, it has been stated as follows: “It is necessary that the Legislature should be able to cure inadvertent defects in statutes or their administration by making what has been aptly called “small repairs”. Moreover, the individual who claims that a vested right has arisen from the defect is seeking a windfall since had the legislature’s or administrator’s action had the effect it was intended to and could have had, no such right would have arisen.
