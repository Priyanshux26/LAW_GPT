v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (2004) 10 SCC 201 [106] 81 Mahim Patram (P) Ltd. v. Union of India (2007) 3 SCC 668 [25] 82 [1976] 1 SCR 689 : (1975) 2 SCC 736 [29] 1672 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports be taxed, howsoever inequitable the consequences may appear to the judicial mind. If the Revenue seeking to tax cannot bring the subject within the letter of law, the subject is free no matter that such a construction may cause serious prejudice to the Revenue. In other words, though what is called equitable construction may be admissible in relation to other statutes or other provisions of a taxing statute, such a construction is not admissible in the interpretation of a charging or taxing provision of a taxing statute.” 37. A statute is designed to be workable. A statutory provision must be construed in a manner to make it workable to achieve the purpose of the legislation.83 A construction that fails to achieve the manifest purpose of legislation or reduces the statutory provisions to futility should be avoided.84 The machinery provisions must be construed to effectuate the object and purpose of a statute and not defeat them. In J K Synthetics Ltd. v. CTO,85 a Constitution Bench of this Court observed: “16. It is well-known that when a statute levies a tax it does so by inserting a charging section by which a liability is created or fixed and then proceeds to provide the machinery to make the liability effective. It, therefore, provides the machinery for the assessment of the liability already fixed by the charging section, and then provides the mode for the recovery and collection of tax, including penal provisions meant to deal with defaulters. Provision is also made for charging interest on delayed payments, etc. Ordinarily the charging section which fixes the liability is strictly construed but that rule of strict construction is not extended to the machinery provisions which are construed like any other statute. The machinery provisions must, no doubt, be so construed as would effectuate the object and purpose of the statute and not defeat the same.” (emphasis supplied) 83 K P Mohammed Salim v. CIT (2008) 11 SCC 573 [14]; 84 Mohan Kumar Singhania v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 594 [52]; CIT v. Hindustan Bulk Carriers (2003) 3 SCC 57 [17] 85 [1997] 1 SCR 603 : (1994) 4 SCC 276 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1673 Union of India & Ors. v. Rajeev Bansal 38. The provisions in a taxing statute dealing with machinery for assessment have to be construed in accordance with the intention of the legislature to make the charge levied effective.86 While interpreting provisions that set up the machinery of assessment, the rule is that construction should be preferred which makes the machinery workable87 and furthers the intention of the legislature.88 In CIT v. Sun Engineering Works (P) Ltd.,89 a two-Judge Bench of this Court observed that the provision dealing with reassessment contained in Section 147 of the Income Tax Act was for the benefit of the Revenue: “40.
