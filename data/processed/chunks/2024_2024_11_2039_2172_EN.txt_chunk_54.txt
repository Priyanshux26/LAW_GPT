The of the NCLT dated 22.06.2021 approving the Resolution Plan had fixed the Effective Date as the 90th day from the Approval date, which was subject to a maximum extension of another 180 days. It consciously removed the ambiguity that plagued Clauses 7.6.2 and 7.6.4 respectively for the precise reason & with the idea that the Effective Date should not be endlessly postponed. Agreeing to such an erroneous proposition would mean that the Effective Date would never be achieved as long as the parties are litigating [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2119 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. before the Courts and the SRA would be absolved of taking the implementation under the Resolution Plan further. The NCLAT had declined to stay the of the NCLT dated 13.01.2023 which held that all the Conditions Precedent were fulfilled. Further, on a perusal of the impugned , it is evident that the NCLT and NCLAT rendered concurrent findings of fact that the SRA had fulfilled all the Conditions Precedent. In other words, it was repeatedly declared by different fora that the Effective Date was frozen on 20.05.2022 and the obligation of the SRA to implement the Resolution Plan was absolute. All steps necessary should have been undertaken by the SRA, at least post the impugned of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2024. To contend that its hands were tied since the Conditions Precedent were still being challenged before this Court is nothing but a reflection of the mala fide intention on the part of the SRA to not fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Resolution Plan under the garb of pendency of litigation. Such an undue delay cannot be permitted, especially in light of the intention of the IBC, 2016 to ensure a successful and time-bound revival of the Corporate Debtor. This places a higher obligation on the SRA to act in an expeditious manner. b. Whether the NCLAT could have directed the Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) to be adjusted against the first tranche payment which was to be made within 180 days of the Effective Date? 98. There is no dispute to the fact that the Effective Date was frozen on 20.05.2022. Therefore, as per Clause 6.3.1(g) on the “Infusion of Funds and Timelines”, and Serial No.11 under Clause 7.7, the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore had to be made by the SRA, upfront, within a period of 180 days from the Effective Date i.e., 20.05.2022. As per the Resolution Plan, this 180-day timeline otherwise would have expired on 16.11.2022. Several extensions were granted to the SRA to infuse this amount, at different stages of this litigation, by the NCLT, the NCLAT and this Court as well - First, by the NCLT vide dated 13.01.2023, by which the timeline for infusion of first tranche payment was extended till 15.05.2023; Secondly, by the NCLAT vide dated 26.05.2023, where the timeline of 180 days was further extended up to 31.08.2023; Thirdly, again by the NCLAT vide dated 28.08.2023, where the timeline of 180 days was 2120 [2024] 11 S.C.R.
