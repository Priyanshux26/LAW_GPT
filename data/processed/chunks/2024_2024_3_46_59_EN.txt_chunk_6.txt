The suit was filed on 26.05.1999. Even the pleaded case of the defendants, especially defendant No. 1 who is the husband of plaintiff No. 3 and father of plaintiffs No. 1 and 2, in the written statement filed by him was not that there was any partition in the year 1965. Quite late, the plaintiffs sought to amend the plaint seeking to raise pleadings regarding 1965 partition. The Trial Court, vide dated 11.10.2006 rejected the application for amendment of the plaint. The aforesaid was not challenged any further. Meaning thereby, the same attained finality as far as the case sought to be set up by the plaintiffs based on 1965 partition. 56 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 15. There is no quarrel with the proposition of law that no evidence could be led beyond pleadings. It is not a case in which there was any error in the pleadings and the parties knowing their case fully well had led evidence to enable the Court to deal with that evidence. In the case in hand, specific amendment in the pleadings was sought by the plaintiffs with reference to 1965 partition but the same was rejected. In such a situation, the evidence with reference to 1965 partition cannot be considered. 16. The plea sought to be taken by the plaintiffs regarding 1965 partition in the replication filed by them would not come to their rescue for the reason that the amendment application filed to raise that plea was specifically rejected. The Trial Court had rightly ignored the plea taken in the replication by the plaintiffs regarding oral partition of 1965, as amendment sought to that effect had already been declined. What was not permitted to be done directly cannot be permitted to be done indirectly. 17. In the written statement filed by defendant No. 7, a specific plea was raised regarding 1984 partition and the property bearing Regular Survey No. 106/2 coming to his share. In the additional written statement filed by defendant No. 7 before the Trial Court, a specific plea was raised that the property bearing Regular Survey No. 44/4 had exclusively fallen to his share in the family partition effected on 30.08.1984. This gets credence from a decree passed by the Civil Court in Civil Suit No. 80 of 1995, titled as “Sri Ramarao Vyasarao Desai v. Dr. Shriramarao Raghavendrarao Desi and another”, decided on 23.06.1995, which notices the partition of 1984. In the aforesaid suit, father of defendant No. 1, who was the only son of Vyasrao and two sons of Raghvendrarao, namely, Prahlad and Srinivas Raghvendrarao were parties. The High Court had gone wrong in holding the aforesaid compromise decree to be bad without there being any challenge to the same by the parties. It is not even the case set up before the Trial Court. 18. As a consequence, the finding recorded by the High Court that all Schedule ‘A’ properties were allotted to defendant No. 1 is liable to be set aside. ed accordingly.
