Incuria legally means carelessness and per incurium may be equated with per ignorantium. If a is rendered in ignorantium of a statute or a binding authority, it becomes a decision per incurium. Thus, a decision rendered by ignorance of a previous binding decision of its own or of a court of coordinate or higher jurisdiction or in ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a rule having the force of law is per incurium. Such a per incurium decision would not have a precedential value. If a decision has been rendered per incurium, it cannot be said that it lays down good law, even if it has not been expressly overruled vide Mukesh K. Tripathi vs. Senior Divisional Manager, LIC, (2004) 8 SCC 387 (para 23). Thus, a decision per incurium is not binding. 44.2. Another exception to the rule of precedents is the rule of sub- silentio. A decision is passed sub-silentio when the particular point of law in a decision is not perceived by the court or not present to its mind or is not consciously determined by the court and it does not form part of the ratio decidendi it is not binding vide Amrit Das vs. State of Bihar, (2000) 5 SCC 488. 868 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 45. One of the contentions raised in the present case was that since this Court in the dated 13.05.2022 had directed that the State of Gujarat was the appropriate Government, the same was binding on the parties even though it may be contrary to the earlier decisions of this Court. We cannot accept such a submission having regard to what has been observed above in the case of Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. which was also with regard to the application of the same doctrine between the very same parties inasmuch as when a has been delivered per incuriam or passed sub-silentio, the same cannot bind either the parties to the or be a binding precedent for the future even between the same parties. Therefore, for this reason also, the dated 13.05.2022 would not bind the parties thereto and particularly, to the petitioner in Writ Petition (Crl.) No.491 of 2022 who was in any case not a party to the said writ proceeding. 46. Having regard to the above discussion and in light of the provisions of the CrPC, the s of this Court and our own understanding of the dated 13.05.2022 passed by a coordinate Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No.135 of 2022, we hold as follows: (i) that the Government of State of Gujarat (respondent No.1 herein) had no jurisdiction to entertain the applications for remission or pass the s of remission on 10.08.2022 in favour of respondent No.3 to 13 herein as it was not the appropriate Government within the meaning of sub-section (7) of Section 432 of the CrPC; (ii) that this Court’s dated 13.05.2022 being vitiated and obtained by fraud is therefore a nullity and non estin law.
