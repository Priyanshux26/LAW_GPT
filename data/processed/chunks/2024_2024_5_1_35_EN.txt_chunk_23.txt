40. It will also be relevant to note that this Court in a catena of cases has held that the Code is a self-contained Code. Reference in this respect could be made to the following s of this Cout: [2024] 5 S.C.R. 33 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India v. Satyanarayan Bankatlal Malu & Ors. (i) Innoventive Industries Limited vs ICICI Bank and another10; (ii) Principal Commissioner of Income Tax vs Monnet Ispat and Energy Limited11; (iii) E.S. Krishnamurthy and others vs Bharath Hi-Tech Builders Private Limited12; (iv) Pratap Technocrats Private Limited and others vs Monitoring Committee of Reliance Infratel Limited and another13; (v) V. Nagarajan vs. SKS Ispat and Power Limited and others14; (vi) Embassy Property Developments Private Limited vs State of Karnataka and others (supra); and (vii) Bharti Airtel Ltd. and another vs Vijaykumar V. Iyer and others (supra). V. CONCLUSION 41. Applying these legal principles, we will have to analyze the provisions of Section 236(1) of the Code. Under Section 236(1) of the Code, reference is “offences under this Code shall be tried by the Special Court established under Chapter XXVIII of the Companies Act, 2013”. 42. It can thus be seen that the reference is not general but specific. The reference is only to the fact that the offences under the Code shall be tried by the Special Court established under Chapter XXVIII of the Companies Act. 43. Applying the principle as laid down by this Court in various s, since the reference is specific and not general, it will have to be held that the present case is a case of ‘legislation by incorporation’ and not a case of ‘legislation by reference’. The effect would be that the provision with regard to Special Court has been bodily lifted from Section 435 of the Companies Act, 2013 and incorporated in Section 236(1) of the Code. In other words, the provision of Section 435 of 10 [2017] 8 SCR 33 : (2018) 1 SCC 407 11 (2018) 18 SCC 786 12 [2021] 12 SCR 28 : (2022) 3 SCC 161 13 [2021] 8 SCR 938 : (2021) 10 SCC 623 14 [2021] 14 SCR 736 : (2022) 2 SCC 244 34 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the Companies Act, 2013 with regard to Special Court would become a part of Section 236(1) of the Code as on the date of its enactment. If that be so, any amendment to Section 435 of the Companies Act, 2013, after the date on which the Code came into effect would not have any effect on the provisions of Section 236(1) of the Code. The Special Court at that point of time only consists of a person who was qualified to be a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge. 44. It is further to be noted that the Code has also suffered two subsequent amendments i.e. the 2015 Amendment and the 2018 Amendment. If the legislative intent was to give effect to the subsequent amendments in the Companies Act to Section 236(1) of the Code, nothing prevented the legislature from amending Section 236(1) of the Code.
