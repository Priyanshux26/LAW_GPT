CONCLUSION A 48. In view of the aforesaid discussions, the issue is answered by concluding that: (i) a true and proper interpretation of section 25 of the CPC leads us to the conclusion that the same applies to inter- State transfer of a suit, appeal or other proceeding where B both States have a High Court in terms of Article 214 of the Constitution and not to a transfer where both States have a common High Court under Article 231 thereof; and (ii) the power under section 24 of the CPC can be exercised by the High Court even for inter-State transfer of a suit, C appeal or other proceeding, if it is the common High Court for two or more States under Article 231 of the Constitution and both the Civil Courts (transferor and transferee) are subordinate to it. The questions framed at the beginning of this are answered accordingly. D RELIEF 49. The sequitur of this discussion, with respect, is that the Gauhati High Court while rendering the and under challenge proceeded on an erroneous approach, and such approach has also been found to be flawed in Megha Jain (supra). The impugned and E being unsustainable in law has to be and is, accordingly, set aside and the civil appeal stands allowed. The Gauhati High Court shall now proceed to decide the application under section 24 of the CPC afresh, on its own merits. 50. In view of the aforesaid , the transfer petition under section F 25 of the CPC is rendered infructuous; hence, it stands dismissed. 51. We request the Gauhati High Court to assign reasonable priority to the application under section 24 of the CPC and to dispose of the same as early as possible, subject to its convenience. 52. Parties shall bear their own costs. G Ankit Gyan Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Aarsh Choudhary, LCRA) H
