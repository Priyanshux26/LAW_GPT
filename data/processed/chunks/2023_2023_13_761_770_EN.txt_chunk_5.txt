16. In the ordinary course, we would have remanded the appeal to the High Court for a fresh hearing on the ground that the appellant was not heard before confi rming conviction on a modifi ed charge. However, 768 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. we cannot ignore that the incident is of 1987, and the present appeal is of 2011. Therefore, it will be unjust to pass an of remand. Hence, we have examined the evidence on record. 17. In the case of Chittarmal v. State of Rajasthan2, this Court dealt with the conversion of charge from Section 302 read with Section 149 of IPC, to Section 302, read with Section 34 of IPC. Paragraph 14 of the said decision reads thus: “14. It is well settled by a catena of decisions that Section 34 as well as Section 149 deal with liability for constructive criminality i.e. vicarious liability of a person for acts of others. Both the sections deal with combinations of persons who become punishable as sharers in an off ence. Thus they have a certain resemblance and may to some extent overlap. But a clear distinction is made out between common intention and common object in that common intention denotes action in concert and necessarily postulates the existence of a prearranged plan implying a prior meeting of the minds, while common object does not necessarily require proof of prior meeting of minds or preconcert. Though there is a substantial diff erence between the two sections, they also to some extent overlap and it is a question to be determined on the facts of each case whether the charge under Section 149 overlaps the ground covered by Section 34. Thus, if several persons numbering fi ve or more, do an act and intend to do it, both Section 34 and Section 149 may apply. If the common object does not necessarily involve a common intention, then the substitution of Section 34 for Section 149 might result in prejudice to the accused and ought not, therefore, to be permitted. But if it does involve a common intention then the substitution of Section 34 for Section 149 must be held to be a formal matter. Whether such recourse can be had or not must depend on the facts of each case. The non-applicability of Section 149 is, therefore, no bar in convicting the appellants under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC, if the evidence discloses commission of an off ence in furtherance of the common intention of them all. 2 (2003) 2 SCC 266 CHANDRA PRATAP SINGH v.
