The words “as far as it can be made applicable” make it clear that, in applying the various provisions of the Code to proceedings other than those of a suit, the court must take into account the nature of those proceedings and the relief sought. The object of Article 226 is to provide a quick and inexpensive remedy to aggrieved parties. Power has consequently been vested in the High Courts to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases any government, within the jurisdiction of the High Court, s or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari. It is plain that if the procedure of a suit had also to be adhered to in the case of writ petitions, the entire purpose of having a quick and inexpensive remedy would be defeated. A writ 516 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports petition under Article 226, it needs to be emphasised, is essentially different from a suit and it would be incorrect to assimilate and incorporate the procedure of a suit into the proceedings of a petition under Article 226.” (Emphasis supplied) Position After 1976 44. By the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976, Explanation to Section 141 came to be inserted. It reads thus: “Explanation.-In this section, the expression “proceedings” includes proceedings under IX, but does not include any proceeding under Article 226 of the Constitution.” 45. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it has been stated: “The question of whether an application under Article 226 of the Constitution is a ‘proceeding in any court of civil jurisdiction’ within the meaning of Section 141 has been the subject matter of controversy. While the Andhra Pradesh High Court holds that Section 141 applies to such proceedings, the Allahabad, Calcutta, Madras and Punjab High Court have held that Section 141 does not apply to such proceedings and in the circumstances, it is being clarified that Section 141 does not apply to proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution.” 46. In view of the Explanation to Section 141 of the CPC, now it can no longer be contended that the provisions of CPC would apply to the proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution. 47. This Court in Puran Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab & Ors. reported in (1996) 2 SCC 205, in paras 9, 10 and 11 respectively has held as under:- “9. In the case of Ram Kala v. Asstt. Director, Consolidation of Holdings [AIR 1977 P&H 87 : 79 Punj LR 100] , a Full Bench of three Judges held that Article 137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act does not apply to an application for adding or substituting a party to a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. It was also held that Section 141 of the Code cannot be pressed into service for applying [2024] 7 S.C.R. 517 M/s Al-Can Export Pvt. Ltd. v. Prestige H.M. Polycontainers Ltd. & Ors. the provisions including 22 of the Code in a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution.
