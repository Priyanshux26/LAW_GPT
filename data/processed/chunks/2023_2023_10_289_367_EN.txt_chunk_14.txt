Learned counsel appearing for the respective writ petitioners/ intervenors have challenged the vires of Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act to the extent it excludes Indians, who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975 and more C particularly, the definition of “Sikkimese” in Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act and Proviso to Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act, insofar as, it excludes from the exempted category “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008”, mainly on the following grounds and making the following submissions:- (i) That the definition of “Sikkimese” in Section 10(26AAA) D of the Income Tax Act to the extent it excludes Indians, who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975 is discriminatory, arbitrary and unfair and it violates the fundamental rights of those Indians, who have settled in Sikkim prior to 26.04.1975 under Articles E 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India; (ii) In the definition of “Sikkimese”, the old Indian settlers of Sikkim have been excluded from the purview of the definition of “Sikkimese” and therefore are not entitled to exemption from Income Tax. It is submitted that the F exemption which has been granted to ‘Sikkimese” people residing in Sikkim essentially exempts 95% of the residents of Sikkim while taxing only a handful of persons including the 1% / 2% old Indian settlers; (iii) The exclusion of the old Indian settlers from the definition G of ‘Sikkimese’ in Clause 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act is clearly violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and does not satisfy any of the tests laid down by this Hon’ble Court under Article 14; (iv) It is submitted that as consistently held by this Hon’ble Court that in to be held valid any legislation under Article H 308 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 14, the classification should be reasonable and must have a nexus with the object sought to be achieved; (v) It is contended that by way of the amendment, one single class of persons, namely, the citizens of India, are sought to be treated differently for the purpose of taxation; B (vi) It is urged that to exclude the old Indian settlers from the exemption under Section 10(26AAA) has no nexus with the object sought to be achieved to grant the exemption to the residents of Sikkim; (vii) It is submitted that there is no reasonable classification C between the residents/origins of Sikkim whose names were registered as “Sikkim Subjects” under the Sikkim Subjects Regulations, 1961 and those Indian old Sikkim settlers, whose names could not be registered as “Sikkim Subjects” as their forefathers did not surrender the Indian citizenship; D (viii) It is further submitted that after the Sikkim became part of the Union of India, all the residents of Sikkim have become the citizens of India.
