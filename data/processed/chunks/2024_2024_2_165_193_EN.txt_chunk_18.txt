It is pertinent to note that the said was never challenged by the Appellant No.1 and so it has attained finality. 37. To hold that – in spite of the Appellant No.1 not doing everything required to be done, and which were under his control to do – his application before the Caste Certificate Scrutiny Committee was still pending on 10.07.2023 for the purposes of Section 3 of the Temporary Extension Act, 2023, would be letting the Appellant No.1 take advantage of his own wrong. It will also go against the object and purpose of extending the time for production of the Validity Certificate by further period of twelve months from 10.07.2023. 38. As is clear from Section 3(1), the further period of twelve months from 10.07.2023 was for those whose applications were validly filed and pending and where their applications have been submitted before the date of nomination. Sub-section (1)(b) of Section 3 of the Temporary Extension Act, 2023 only revives the membership of those, whose applications are pending by enacting a deeming provision, since they are now given a further period of twelve months from 10.07.2023 to furnish the Validity Certificate. Sub-section (2) (b) clearly states that Section 3(1) was not to apply to members whose applications for Validity Certificate has been rejected by the Scrutiny Committee. 39. The contention of learned counsel for the Appellant No.1 that there was no rejection and that it was only a “filing” or “lodgment” of the application on 01-03/04/2021 by the Scrutiny Committee, does not commend itself to us for acceptance. The rejection in Section 3(2) (b) will also include those cases where applications came to be 192 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports rejected on account of defaults committed at the end of the applicants themselves. An applicant who has certain things under his control ought to have done everything that is under his control for the purpose of Section 3 of the Temporary Extension Act, 2023. This would also mean that Section 3(1) of the Temporary Extension Act, 2023 would not apply since there was no valid application filed before the nomination to the Scrutiny Committee and which was pending. That his application was not pending, was also the undertaking of the Appellant No.1, as explained hereinabove. Accepting the contention of the Appellant No.1 would also amount to putting a premium on the concession given to a party who was taking the ‘risk’ of contesting the election by not having a Validity Certificate on the date of the nomination. 40. For the above reasons, we hold that the Appellant No.1 stood automatically disqualified as a Member since he failed to produce the Validity Certificate within 12 months from the date of his election. The protective umbrella of Section 3 of the Temporary Extension Act, 2023 will not be available to Appellant No.1 since he is hit by Section 3(2)(b), for the reason that there was no valid application pending on the date of the commencement of the said Act.
