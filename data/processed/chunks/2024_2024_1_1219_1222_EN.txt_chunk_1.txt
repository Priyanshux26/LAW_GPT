6. While the revision was pending before the High Court, the petitioner was unable to serve respondent no. 8 for a long time due to some issue about change in the names. Having waited for long, High Court passed a peremptory on 01.12.2005 that if the objections were not removed within a period of two weeks, the revision petition would stand dismissed without reference to the Court. 1 In CA No. 1109/2013 in MCA No. 12275/2013 in CRA No. 284/2003 dated 05.11.2014. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1221 Omdeo Baliram Musale & Ors. v. Prakash Ramchandra Mamidwar & Ors. 7. On 12.12.2005, the petitioner’s advocate is said to have prepared an application for change of name of respondent no. 8 and a copy was also served on the respondent’s advocate but in the meanwhile the peremptory came into operation and the revision petition came to be dismissed on 15.12.2005. 8. Despite the dismissal of the revision petition, the petitioner filed the application for change in name of respondent no. 8 on 21.12.2005. 9. The sad story continues. In 2011, i.e. after six years, an M.A. for restoration was filed by the petitioner through his son. The son’s affidavit was taken on record. However, the High Court by dated 03.07.2013 dismissed the M.A. only on the ground that it was not moved by the original party to the revision petition. 10. In view of the above referred , another application was filed in 2013 by the petitioner himself for restoration of the revision petition and condonation of delay. The High Court by the dated 05.11.2014, impugned herein, dismissed the application for restoration. 11. The story does not stop here. The petitioner then filed a Special Leave Petition against the above-said impugned and notice was issued by this Court on 06.04.2015. 12. From 2015, the matter has been pending before this Court. Proceedings in the case indicate that the SLP was listed several times between 2015 and 2024 but could not be heard as notice on some respondents was not complete. 13. The above referred facts indicate that the suit that was filed in 1982 never took off as even summons were not issued. It might not be surprising for lawyers, judges and those who are acquainted with civil court proceedings. The real danger is when we accept this position and continue with it as part of a systematic problem. Until and unless we believe that this situation is unacceptable and act accordingly, the power, authority and jurisdiction of Courts to address simple reliefs of citizens will be consumed and destroyed by passage of time. This is not acceptable at all. 14. There must be a solution, idea and resolve to rectify this situation and ensure that simple, quick and easy remedies are available to correct an illegality for a rightful restitution. We have referred to all this only to take note of what has happened and take steps to rectify it in the time to come. 1222 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 15.
