The facts at hand, the trial court has disbelieved such evidence. The discarding of eye-witness testimony is a fact-specifi c inquiry, and therefore the correction of such an action by the trial court shall be discussed later. 14. The law on circumstantial evidence, is well settled. The locus classicus on the issue is Sharad Birdhichand Sarda, (supra) which stands consistently followed up until very recently in Kamal v. State (NCT of Delhi)31. 14.1 Illustratively, in Gargi v. State of Haryana32 this court has, referring to various earlier s, summarised the principles relating to circumstantial evidence. The principle, is that the sum total of circumstances, when examined should point to the guilt of the accused, while ruling out all other possible hypotheses including his innocence and absence of second party guilt. Further reference may be made to Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura33 and Prakash Nishad v. State of Maharashtra34. CONSIDERATION BY THIS COURT 15.
