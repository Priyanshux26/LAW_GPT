Article 310(1) which embodies the pleasure doctrine is a provision contained in the Constitution. Therefore, rules made under the proviso to Article 309 or under Acts referable to that article are subject to Article 310(1). By the opening words of Article 310(1) the pleasure doctrine contained therein operates “Except as expressly provided by this Constitution”. Article 311 is an express provision of the Constitution. Therefore, rules made under the proviso to Article 309 or under Acts referable to Article 309 would be subject both to Article 310(1) & Article 311……….” 74. This Court held that, in view of the said term “subject to the provisions of this Constitution”, rules made under the proviso to Article 309 must 20 [1985] Supp. 2 SCR 131 : (1985) 3 SCC 398 : 1985 INSC 155 726 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports be made subject to the provisions of this Constitution if they are to be valid. The Constitution Bench held that the rules made under the proviso to Article 309 or under Acts referable to that article are subject to Articles 310(1) and 311 of the Constitution. 75. In our opinion, Article 131 of the Constitution is a special provision which deals with the original jurisdiction of this Court in case of a dispute between the Federal Government and the State Governments. It provides for a special jurisdiction to this Court to decide any question on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends. Any dispute either between the Government of India and one or more States; or between the Government of India and any State or States on one side and one or more other States on the other; or between two or more States which involve a question on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends are covered by this provision. A special provision has been made for deciding the question on which the existence or extent of a legal right between the special parties mentioned therein has been provided. Therefore, the words “subject to the provisions of this Constitution” will have to be considered in that context. The jurisdiction under Article 131 of the Constitution would only be subject to any other provision in the Constitution which provides for entertaining a dispute between the parties mentioned therein. We could notice only one such other provision in the Constitution, which is Article 262, which reads thus: “262. Adjudication of disputes relating to waters of inter-State rivers or river valleys.—(1) Parliament may by law provide for the adjudication of any dispute or complaint with respect to the use, distribution or control of the waters of, or in, any inter-State river or river valley. (2) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, Parliament may by law provide that neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall exercise jurisdiction in respect of any such dispute or complaint as is referred to in clause (1).” 76. Article 262 of the Constitution deals with adjudication of disputes relating to waters of inter-State rivers or river valleys.
