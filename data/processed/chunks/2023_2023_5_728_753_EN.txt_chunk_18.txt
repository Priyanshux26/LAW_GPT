Any delay on the part of the Court cannot prejudice the applicant. 23. In this case, the appellants filed the application both under Section 17 of the Act and under IX Rule 13 on the same day, B namely, 06.05.2014. The application under IX Rule 13 is premised on knowledge of the ex parte decree being obtained on 05.05.2014 in the Execution Proceedings. There was no security offered on 06.05.2014. Though a direction as such was not expressly sought for but permission was sought for to furnish security, it could be said that in substance the C appellants essentially sought for direction within the meaning of the proviso to Section 17. We have already found that the High Court was in error in finding that the appellants did not seek for dispensing with the security, and therefore, apparently holding the same against the appellants. When the appellants sought for permission to furnish security, if the permission was granted and a direction to furnish security was given on the same D date and it had been complied with within the time, then the appellants would have been compliant with Section 17. No s were passed on the application under Section 17 dated 06.05.2014. Within 6 days, on 12.05.2014, the appellants on their own purported to furnish security. The surety was one Abhishek Dixit (the 3rd writ petitioner who is the 7th E proforma respondent in the appeal). The security was however, a shop. The shop was not owned by the surety. The Municipal Corporation, Lucknow was the owner. The surety was a tenant. A security to be provided under Section 17 by a surety is to be enforced under the provisions of Section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure as contemplated in Section 17 (2) of the Act. Section 145 of the CPC inter alia provides F that the security provided by a surety can be enforced by effecting sale of the property. The courts in this case have held that the security provided by the appellants through the surety is not acceptable in law having regard to Section 17 (2) as the shop belonged to the Municipal Corporation, Lucknow and it could not be sold for enforcing the surety. G 24. While it is true that no was passed on the application under Section 17 on 06.05.2014, the fact remains that the appellants on their own furnished a surety as stated. The High Court reasons that the security so provided was unacceptable on two grounds. Firstly, it was not furnished along with the application under IX Rule 13 on 06.05.2014. Secondly, it is found that it was not acceptable in law. H 752 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 25. It is true that the High Court in the dated 03.12.2015 proceeded to find that the “security was accepted by the court below”. This is by way of accepting the submission of the counsel for the plaintiffs. It was on this basis that the matter was remanded. Following the remand, the trial court allowed the application filed by the appellants and also the application under IX Rule 13.
