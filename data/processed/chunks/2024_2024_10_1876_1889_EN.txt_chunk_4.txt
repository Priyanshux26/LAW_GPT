13. Even after, referring to the decisions mentioned above, we think it equally relevant to refer to the decision of this Court in Dharma Rama Bhagare v. State of Maharashtra.8 It was held therein thus: - "The first information report, it may be pointed out, is never treated as a substantive piece of evidence. It can only be used for corroborating or contradicting its maker when he appears in court as a witness.” 14. There can be no doubt with respect to the position that the prime object of FIR, from the point of view of the informant is to set the criminal law in motion and from the point of the investigating authorities 4 [2003] 3 SCR 485 : (2003) 6 SCC 175 5 [2011] 4 SCR 1176 : (2011) 4 SCC 324 6 [2013] 14 SCR 713 : (2014) 2 SCC 1 7 [2020] 14 SCR 198 : (2021) 1 SCC 1 8 [1973] 3 SCR 92 : (1973) 1 SCC 537 1882 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports is to obtain information about the alleged activity so as to enable to take suitable steps to trace and book the guilty. Thus, it can be said that FIR is an important document, though not a substantial piece of evidence, and may be put in evidence to support or contradict the evidence of its maker viz., the informant. Whether the omission(s) is one which seriously impeaches the credibility of the witness and is sufficient to reject the testimony of the informant would depend upon the question whether it is of an important fact and whether that fact was within the knowledge of the informant, going by the case of prosecution unraveled through the witness concerned. 15. Thus, the position with respect to FIR is clear from the decisions referred supra that even though it is not meant to be an encyclopedia containing chronicle of all intricate and minute details, it could be used to corroborate its maker under Section 157 of the Evidence Act or to contradict its maker viz., the informant under Section 145 of the Evidence Act to establish whether he is a trustworthy witness or not. 16. Realising and recognizing the aforesaid position with respect to FIR we will proceed to consider whether the disinclination on the part of the High Court to rely on, rather, treating the evidence of the informant – PW8 as unreliable is justifiable and sustainable in law. 17. Through the evidence of PW8, the mother of the deceased, who is also the informant, the prosecution has attempted to establish the existence of an oral dying declaration. It is to be noted that dying declaration itself is not a strong piece of evidence and therefore, when it is verbal and that too, allegedly made to a close relative (in this case allegedly to the mother), evidence of mother about the oral dying declaration was to be treated with care and caution. To show that the trial Court dealt with the same without due care and caution self- evident from paragraph 32 of the of the Trial Court, which reads thus: - "32.
