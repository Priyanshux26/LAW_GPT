760, 762 and Pathumma v. State of Kerala [(1978) 2 SCC 1 : (1978) 2 SCR 537] SCR at p. 545. )” F 109. Still further, we find that in paragraph-115, it has been held that “coal companies are monopolies within the meaning of the provisions of the Nationalisation Act”. 110. It is again observed in paragraph-118 that the first appellant and its subsidiary company enjoyed the monopoly of production, G distribution and sale thereof. 111. We may further notice that in paragraph-167, this Court held: “167. In fact the decisions of this Court on price fixation also point out that although a reasonable profit may be permissible, profiteering would not be.” H 882 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A 112. Finally, we find the following observations to be found in paragraph-193: “193. However, discussions made hereinbefore should not be taken to lay down a law that the Central Government and for that matter the coal companies cannot change their policy decision. They evidently can; but therefor there should be a public interest as B contradistinguished from a mere profit motive. Any change in the policy decision for cogent and valid reasons is acceptable in law; but such a change must take place only when it is necessary, and upon undertaking of an exercise of separating the genuine consumers of coal from the rest. If the coal companies intend to C take any measure they may be free to do so. But the same must satisfy the requirements of constitutional as also the statutory schemes; even in relation to an existing scheme e.g. Open Sales Schemes, indisputably the coal companies would be at liberty to formulate the new policy which would meet the changed situation. E-advertisement or e-tender would be welcome but then therefor D a greater transparency should be maintained. 113. The appellants rely upon the of this Court in State of Tamil Nadu and Others v. L. Abu Kavur Bai and Others26 for the proposition that the scheme of monopoly or nationalisation subservespublic good. In the said case, the Court was dealing with a case of nationalisation E of transport services. There can be no quarrel with the proposition that the purpose of the Nationalisation Act was indeed to subserve the common good as held in Tara Prasad Singh and Others v. Union of India and Others27. The purpose of the vesting under the Nationalisation Act was to distribute the resource to subserve the common good. (See paragraph- 32) F 114. We may, in fact, notice the concern of the Court about coal being not inexhaustible and the need for a wise and planned conservation of the resources being expressed in paragraph-39. No doubt, all this was at the time when the Nation was confronted with the condition of the mines being what it was as brought out in the Statement of Objects. G 115. We agree with the appellants and as held by this Court in State of Karnataka and Another v. Shri Ranganatha Reddy and Another28 that distribution is a word of wide meaning and it is covered 26 (1984)1 SCC 515 27 1980 (4) SCC 179 H 28 1977 (4) SCC 471 COAL INDIA LIMITED v.
