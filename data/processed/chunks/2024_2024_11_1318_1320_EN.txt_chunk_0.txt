Mahadevan, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the High Court was correct in setting aside the passed by Trial Court wherein, Trial Court condoned the delay of 4½ Years for filing of written statement. Headnotes† Limitation Act, 1963 – Whether a party may be allowed to file written statement with a delay of 4½ Years: Held: The Court has noticed that the growing tendency on the part of the litigants in throwing the entire blame on the head of the advocate for the delay – Even if the Court assumes that the advocate was careless or negligent, this, by itself, cannot be a ground to condone long and inordinate delay as the litigant owes a duty to be vigilant of his own rights and is expected to be equally vigilant about the judicial proceedings pending in the court initiated at his instance – The litigant should not be permitted to throw the entire blame on the head of the advocate and thereby disown him at any time and seek relief – The High Court was correct in setting aside the Trial Court’s – Therefore, the petition fails and is dismissed.
