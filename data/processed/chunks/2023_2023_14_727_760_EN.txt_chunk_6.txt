Proceeding further, we notice, that this is a case involving primarily a dying declaration made by the accused in addition to the ocular and circumstantial evidence. 10. In fact, the dying declaration (Ext. P1) proven by PW19, is the main foundation of the prosecution case. It would be benefi cial to appreciate the principles that the courts must adhere to when adjudicating a case of this nature. PRINCIPLES IN REGARD TO DYING DECLARATIONS 11.Section 32 the Indian Evidence Act, 18723 relates to statements, written or verbal of relevant fact made by a person who is dead or who cannot be found, in other words, dying declaration. The various principles laid down by pronouncements of this court in respect of dying declarations can be summarised as under: – 11.1 The basic premise is “nemo moriturus praesumitur mentire” i.e. man will not meet his maker with a lie in his mouth. 11.1.1 In Laxman v. State of Maharashtra4 a Constitution bench of this court observed: – 3 For brevity, “IEA” 4 (2002) 6 SCC 710 [5 Judge Bench] 738 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. “when the party is at the point of death and when every hope of this world is gone, when every motive to falsehood is silenced, and the man is induced by the most powerful consideration to speak only the truth The situation in which a man is on the deathbed is so solemn and serene, is the reason in law to accept the veracity of his statement.” 11.2 For a statement to be termed a “dying declaration”, and thereby be admissible under Section 32 of IEA, the circumstances discussed/ disclosed therein “must have some proximate relation to the actual occurrence”.
