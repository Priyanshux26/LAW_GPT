Therefore, the same cannot be D said to be manufacturing of goods different from being manufactured before such diversification. With the passage of time, due to advancement in technology, if there is a replacement of the old machinery with the new machinery for improvement in quality and quantity of a product, at the most, it can be said to be expansion and/or modernization, but it cannot be said to be E “diversification”, which is “manufacturing of goods different from the goods manufactured before such diversification”. In a case of “diversification”, the effect has to be that the quality and quantity of the product should have been improved and/or increased but if the ultimate use is the same, the product F manufactured on use of modern and/or advanced technology cannot be said to be manufacturing the different goods for claiming the exemption from payment of trade tax. The words used in Section 4-A are very clear and unambiguous. The Statute and more particularly, the exemption provisions are to be read as they are and to be construed literally and should be given a literal G meaning. Giving the literal meaning to the exemption provision namely, Section 4-A, it cannot be said that the appellant is entitled to the exemption as claimed. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and as observed hereinabove, when the provisions of the Act unequivocally provides that the “diversification” can be considered only in a case where “goods H AMD INDUSTRIES LTD. v. COMMISSIONER OF TRADE TAX, 1037 LUCKNOW & ANR of different nature” are produced, and only then the exemption A shall be available. The goods manufactured on “diversification” must be a “different”, “distinct” and a “separate” good in nature. In the present case, the goods manufactured on use of advance and/or modern technology, cannot be said to be a different commercial activity at all. The High Court has not committed B any error in refusing to grant exemption to the appellant. [Paras 8.3-8.5][1043-G-H; 1044-A-F] Hansraj Gordhandas Vs. H.H.
