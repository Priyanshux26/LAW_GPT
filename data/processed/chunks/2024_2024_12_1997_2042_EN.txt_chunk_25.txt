Further, returns are calculated at a 20% annual rate on the Total Project Cost from the effective date. According to Section 14.1(b)(iii), any shortfall in return recovery is added to the unrecovered Total Project Cost 2032 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of the previous year, thus increasing the base amount on which returns at the prescribed rate are computed for the following year. Consequently, annual shortfalls in returns inflate the Total Project Cost year over year. 60. To understand the increasing Total Project Cost, the CAG Report submitted to this Court is illuminating. The Report highlights those provisions in the Concession Agreement—including fixed, assured high returns without risk-sharing by the Concessionaire, overlapping roles with potential conflicts of interest for key stakeholders, unrestricted project costs, unlimited charge of O&M expenses, and lack of effective revenue control—all primary contributors to the growing unrecovered Total Project Cost. 61. In this regard, the Comptroller-Auditor General made the following germane observations: i. There was no justification to: (a) allow an assured and high rate of Return of 20% in 1997, when the Prime Lending Rate was 13%; (b) not include a clause for revision of the rate of Return based on the Reserve Bank of India’s policies; and (c) not use the opportunities provided at various stages for revising the rate of Return. ii. Since no competitive bidding was held, the Project Cost was not decided in advance nor capped. Thus, NTBCL had no incentive to control the Project Cost and minimise expenses. This violates the principles of financial propriety. iii. The Project Cost, determined by the Independent Auditor, was inflated by Rupees 44.87 crores. The Project Cost on the Commissioning Date should have been Rupees 281.12 crores instead of Rupees 325.99 crores. Such inflated project cost occurred only because returns were allowed before the date of commissioning. The Independent Auditor’s certificate stated that there was an unrecovered Project Cost of Rupees 407.64 crores as on 06.02.2001, which included Rupees 325.99 crores (Project Cost) and Rupees 81.65 crores (unrecovered returns at the rate of 20% from 30.12.1998 to 06.02.2001). The Project Cost prior to the commissioning date should have been taken as nil since no returns before 06.02.2001 were recoverable, as per Sections 14.1 and 14.2 of the Concession Agreement. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2033 Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd. v. Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association and Others iv. The Independent Auditor certified O&M expenses of Rupees 272.40 crores from 06.02.2001 to 31.03.2016. NTBCL booked excessively high O&M expenses of Rupees 272.40 crores during 2000-01 to 2015-16, which was higher than the standard norms used by NHAI/MoRTH, as well as the Feasibility Report of the DND Flyway itself. v. After the appointment of the ITNL Toll Management Services Limited, a subsidiary of NTBCL, as the O&M contractor, the expenditure on account of the O&M contractor’s fee increased from Rupees 5.16 crores between 2008-09 to Rupees 10.49 crores between 2015-16. Thus, the O&M contractor’s fee increased by 103% over eight years from 2008-09 to 2015-16. vi.
