15. It was submitted that the trial court and the High Court both correctly inferred that the informant’s complaint was not entertained by the police, and he could not become a victim of that inaction. Investigations that took place after 21.11.1999, no doubt resulted in statements of some witnesses, but the investigation was not conducted satisfactorily. F Therefore, it was directed to be taken over by PW-12, after which it was conducted properly and a charge sheet accusing all the appellants was filed. Counsel for the state relied on the testimonies of PWs 2 and 3 to contend that they had deposed convincingly that the third appellant was last seen holding the deceased boy’s hands on 8.10.1999. PWs 4 G and 5 deposed to having seen the deceased boy the next day, early morning, in the company of the first two appellants. These facts, conclusively established the appellants’ guilt. Analysis and Findings 16. As may be gathered from the previous discussion, that the H concurrent conviction of the appellants rests entirely on the “last seen” JABIR & ORS. v. THE STATE OF UTTARAKHAND 977 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] theory, upheld by the courts below. The deceased- it has been held, was A seen by PW-2 and PW-3 with the third appellant, Husn Jahan, on the afternoon of 8th October, 1999; she was holding his hand. The boy went missing; his father, PW-1, and other family members searched for him. No report was lodged at that time, and the search continued. The boy’s body was discovered, partly buried, on 10th October, in an open agricultural B field, in another village (Narayanpur). Post mortem was conducted the next day, i.e., on 11th October, 1999; the inquest proceedings too were held that day. PW-1 stated that he attempted to lodge an FIR on 12th October, 1999, against the present appellants, but without success. The FIR was eventually lodged, pursuant to an under Section 156 (3) Cr. PC. upon an application dated 19.11.1999. Investigations were C conducted by PW-8 and, later, from 2.12.1999, by PW-12. The appellants were arrested and charged for the offences, and later convicted. 17. The testimonies of PW-2 and PW-3 were relied upon to prove that Husn Jahan, the third appellant and sister of the first two appellants, was seen in the company of the deceased on 8th October, 1999 at 3:30 D p.m. PW-2 claims to have informed this to PW-1 on 10-10-1999 at 12:00 p.m., before the deceased’s body was found (i.e., at 01:00 p.m.). On the other hand, PW-3, who claimed to have witnessed Husn Jahan holding the deceased’s hand on 8.10.1999, informed PW- 1 about noticing this on 12.10.1999, (since he had gone to visit his son to Bijnor, during the intervening period). The other circumstance is that the boy was seen E last, in the company of the first two appellants, by PWs-4 and 5. 18. For the moment, if the delay in recording the FIR (which is 42 days) is ignored, the salient fact which stares at one’s face is that the conviction is solely based on the testimonies of these two sets of witnesses.
