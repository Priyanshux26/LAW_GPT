Thus, the power of sub- section (3) is intermittent and in addition to the power of sub-section (2) but it may be exercised sparingly, in exceptional circumstances in public interest. In our view, the power of suspension, if any exercised, by the appropriate authority deeming it necessary or expedient in public interest for the reasons so specified, it should be for interim period and not for an inordinate duration. 18. As per above discussion of the legal position, in the facts of the present case as is apparent, the inspection was made on 21.10.2010, and the of suspension was passed on 25.10.2010 without any notice or affording any opportunity of hearing as per sub-section (2) of Section 20. On filing appeal, the appellate authority remitted it to the appropriate authority which passed the subsequent of suspension dated 29.12.2010 exercising the power under sub- section (3) of Section 20, which in our view is not justified and has rightly been set-aside by Learned Single Judge and confirmed by the Division Bench. Therefore, the appeal filed by the appropriate authority is hereby dismissed and the passed by Learned Single Judge and the Division Bench are hereby upheld. Since the under challenge has been implemented and the hospital is 72 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports operational, therefore no further consequential s are required to be passed directing to revive the registration. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan Result of the case: Appeal dismissed.
