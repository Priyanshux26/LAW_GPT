UCO BANK AND OTHERS v. M.B. MOTWANI (DEAD) THR. 529 LRS. & OTHERS [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] Government has to be given its full eff ect. However, the High Court has gone wrong in holding that a chargesheet was required to be issued, though the 1979 Regulations provide that a show cause notice was good enough to show that proceeding has been initiated against an employee. 7. With reference to the amendment in Regulation 20 of 1979 Regulations, he referred to a communication dated 01.07.1985 from the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Aff airs (Banking Division) addressed to the Chief Executive Offi cers of the Nationalised Banks, wherein a direction was issued to initiate process for amendment of Regulation 20 of the 1979 Regulations.

Regulation 20(3)(c) of the 1979 Regulations further provides that an offi cer under suspension of a charge of misconduct shall not be retired or permitted to retire on attaining the age of superannuation.
