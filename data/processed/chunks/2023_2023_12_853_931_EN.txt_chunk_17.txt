Additionally, the Central Government has framed Rules under Section 73 in 2005, regarding the forms and the manner of forwarding a copy of V. SENTHIL BALAJI v. THE STATE REPRESENTED BY 877 DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] of arrest of a person along with the material to the Adjudicating Authority and the period of its retention. In yet another decision in Ahmed Noormohmed Bhatti v. State of Gujarat & Ors., (2005) 3 SCC 647, this Court opined that the provision cannot be held to be unreasonable or arbitrary and, therefore, unconstitutional merely because the authority vested with the power may abuse his authority. (Also see Manzoor Ali Khan v. Union of India & Ors., (2015) 2 SCC 33).” (emphasis supplied) 41. The conclusion thus arrived is that the Legislature in its wisdom has consciously created the necessary safeguards for an arrestee, keeping in mind his liberty, and the need for an external approval and supervision. This provision is in compliance with Article 21 and 22(2) of the Constitution of India, 1950. Section 62 “Law can never be enforced unless fear supports them.” - Sophocles “62. Punishment for vexatious search.—Any authority or offi cer exercising powers under this Act or any rules made thereunder, who without reasons recorded in writing,— (a) searches or causes to be searched any building or place; or (b) detains or searches or arrests any person, shall for every such off ence be liable on conviction for imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or fi ne which may extend to fi fty thousand rupees or both.” 42. This provision is a reiteration of the mandatory compliance of Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002. It is in the nature of a warning to an offi cer concerned to strictly comply with the mandate of Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002 in letter and spirit failing which he would be visited with the consequences. It is his bounden duty to record the reasons for his belief in coming to conclusion that a person has been guilty and therefore, to be arrested. Such a safeguard is meant to facilitate an element of fairness and accountability. 878 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 43. Section 65 “65. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to apply.—The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall apply, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, to arrest, search and seizure, attachment, confi scation, investigation, prosecution and all other proceedings under this Act.” Section 65 provides for the application of the CrPC, 1973 with respect to arrest, search and seizure, etc. The provisions of the CrPC, 1973 being primarily procedural in nature, along with substantive elements, are to be applied, so long as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the PMLA, 2002. Therefore, the PMLA, 2002 shall have precedence and when there is no inconsistency, a procedural assistance can be resorted to, as available under the CrPC, 1973. In other words, the provisions of the CrPC, 1973 are expected to be supplementary to the provisions of the PMLA, 2002.
