‘Light Motor Vehicle’ class need not have a separate endorsement to drive a transport vehicle or omnibus, the gross vehicle weight of which does not exceed 7500 kg or a motor car or tractor or road-roller, the unladen weight of which does not exceed 7500 kg – Though, the did not analyse the provisions that distinguish transport and non-transport vehicles however, the statutory scheme of Motor Vehicle Act is more nuanced than the simple weight-based distinction made in the said – The Court also failed to notice ss.31(2) and (3) which specify ‘Transport’ and ‘Non-Transport’ vehicles however, the gave due consideration to the important statutory provisions – The overlooked provisions would not alter the eventual pronouncement – There are no glaring error or omission that would alter the outcome of the case. [Paras 113-115] Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 – s.2(21) – Light Motor Vehicle (LMV) ‘means’ a ‘Transport Vehicle’ – ‘means’ – Meaning: Held: As per the definition clause of LMV, it inter-alia ‘means’ a ‘Transport Vehicle’ – The use of the word ‘means’ suggests specifics – When the statute says that a word or a phrase shall “mean” (instead of say “include”), it is quite certainly a ‘hard and fast’, strict and exhaustive definition – There is no distinction between the two classes of vehicles – Such a definition is an explicit statement of the full connotation of a term and there is no ambiguity. [Para 32] Interpretation of Statutes – Importance of definition sections – Discussed. Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 – Purpose and objective – Discussed. Interpretation of Statutes – Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 – Social welfare legislation – Interpretation: Held: 1988 Act is fundamentally a social welfare legislation providing a mechanism for victims and their families to seek compensation for loss or injury resulting from road accidents – Also, its provisions regarding licensing and penalties for traffic violations serve the broader purpose of promoting road safety – Thus, any interpretation of its provisions must ensure a mechanism for timely compensation and relief for victims of road accidents and also promote overall road safety. [Para 15] 546 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 – s.2(21) – Strict interpretation of: Held: A light motor vehicle would mean a transport vehicle, omnibus, road roller, tractor, or motor car, provided the weight does not exceed 7,500 kgs. [Para 35] Interpretation of Statutes – Principles of statutory interpretation – Discussed. Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 – Compensation – Accidents involving ‘transport vehicles’ operated by individuals holding licenses to drive ‘light motor vehicles’ – Payment of claims disputed by insurance companies: Held: Compensation must not be denied for minor technical breaches of the licensing conditions – The emphasis on ‘Transport Vehicle’ in the licensing scheme has to be understood only in the context of the ‘medium’ and ‘heavy’ vehicles – This harmonious construction also aligns with the objective of the 1994 amendment in Section 10(2) to simplify the licensing procedure – This would prevent insurance companies from taking a technical plea to defeat a legitimate claim for compensation involving an insured vehicle weighing below 7,500 kgs driven by a person holding a driving license of a ‘Light Motor Vehicle’ class.
