of the Constitution. It is thereafter that the process has started. Further A it is submitted that during the pendency of the present proceedings, two s were passed by this Court on 4.12.2020 issuing certain directions and again on 2.5.2022 issuing further directions. Both the s are reproduced below: dated 04.12.2020: B “By the letter dated 27th September, 2019, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India has written to the Chief Secretary, Government of Punjab/Gujarat/Haryana/Karnataka/NCT of Delhi that on the occasion of commemoration of 550th Birth Anniversary C of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, special remission and release of prisoners are proposed. In particular, the said letter states as follows: “It has been decided that 8 sikh prisoners be given special remission under Article 161 of the Constitution and released from prison. The proposal for commutation of death sentence to life D imprisonment of one prisoner is to be processed under Article 72 of the Constitution of India. The State Government/Union Territory Administration concerned and Centre-State Division of Ministry of Home Affairs are requested to take all required action in this regard.” E On a query made by the Court, Mr. K.M. Nataraj, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Union of India stated that the proposal has not been sent in view of the pending appeals of the co-accused in this Court. It is not denied that the petitioner has himself not filed any appeal against his sentence. Therefore, there is no question of awaiting the outcome F of any appeal pending before this Court. It is obvious that the factum of the appeals pending at the behest of other co-accused would have no relevance to the proposal intended to be sent for consideration under Article 72 of the Constitution of India. G Mr. K.M. Nataraj, learned ASG, therefore, seeks time to make a statement about the proposal as contemplated in the letter dated 27th September, 2019 to be sent for processing under Article 72 of the Constitution of India. List the matter on 8th January, 2021.” H 274 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R.
