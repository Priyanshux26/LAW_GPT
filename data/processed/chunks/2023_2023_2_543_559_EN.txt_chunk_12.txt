SUNDRESH, J.] remain, we are inclined to issue a direction to them to consider A accommodating the private respondents in their respective reserved category, provided they do not exceed the percentage of reservation made permissible, without upsetting the appointment of the appellants and others similarly placed and subject to their eligibility. On the question of inter-se seniority, we do not need to delve much, as the of the B Division Bench stands set aside, and therefore, the private respondents are certainly new entrants, and hence cannot seek precedence.
