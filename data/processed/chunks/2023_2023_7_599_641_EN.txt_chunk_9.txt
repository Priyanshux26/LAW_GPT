However, the notice for invoking of arbitration in accordance with Article 21 of the Contract was issued only on 08.11.2021, i.e., after a period of more than five F years and much beyond the limitation period of three years. According to the learned ASG, the claim of the petitioner is hopelessly time barred. 22. The learned ASG requested the Court to look into the following dates and events for the purpose of deciding the present petition: G 27.03.2012: Contract was executed between the Petitioner and Respondent. 26.09.2016: CAUSE OF ACTION arose Liquidated damages were finally deducted. 25.09.2019: The limitation period of 3 years expired. H M/S B AND T AG v. MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 613 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] 08.11.2021: Advocate for claimant sent ‘Notice for invoking A of Arbitration under Article 21 of the Contract’. 16.11.2021: Respondent received the Notice invoking arbitration. 03.02.2023: The Petitioner filed Arbitration Petition No. 13 B i.e. the Present Petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for Constitution of Arbitral Tribunal. 23. In the last, the learned ASG submitted that the period of limitation for issuing notice invoking arbitration not being specifically C prescribed in the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963 (for short, ‘the Act 1963’) will be covered by the residuary Article i.e., Article 137 of the Schedule to the said Act. 24. In such circumstances referred to above, Mr. Nataraj, the learned ASG prayed that the claim of the petitioner being ex facie time barred, the present petition under Section 11(6) of the Act 1996 may not D be entertained and the same may be rejected. ANALYSIS 25. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the only question that E falls for our reconsideration is whether time-barred claims or claims which are barred by limitation, can be said to be live claims, which can be referred to arbitration? 26. Before adverting to the rival submissions canvassed on either side, we may look into few relevant provisions of the Act 1996 and the F Act 1963. 27. Section 11 of the Act 1996 provides for appointment of arbitrators. Sub section (6) of Section 11 reads thus: “11(6). Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties,— G (a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or (b) the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an agreement expected of them under that procedure; or H 614 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A (c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to him or it under that procedure, a party may request the Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court or any person or institution designated by such Court to take the necessary measure, unless the B agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment.” 28. The plain reading of the aforesaid provision would indicate that no time limit has been prescribed for filing application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 for appointment of an arbitrator.
