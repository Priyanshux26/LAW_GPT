They have cited various decisions of this Court as well as of Courts in other jurisdictions. E 16. The learned Amicus Curiae makes the following specific submissions: 16.1. The Determination of whether an arbitration agreement is duly stamped or not, must be left to the arbitrator. Section 11(6A) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 circumscribes the scope of the appointing F authority. It begins with a non-obstante clause and was specifically meant to overrule the 7-judge bench in SBP & Co v Patel Engg. Ltd8. (for short “SBP”) and National Insurance Co. Ltd. V Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd9(for short “Boghara Polyfab”). Moreover, the ambit of Section 16 of Arbitration Act, 1996 which deals with the competence of an G arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction, is wide enough, according to Mr. Gourab Banerjee, to allow the arbitrator to make a determination with respect to the stamping of the instrument. 8 (2005) 8 SCC 618 H 9 (2009) 1 SCC 267 M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 431 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] 16.2. The 246th Report of the Law Commission of India10 (for A short “246th LCI Report) recommended that the scope of authority be limited to “existence” and “validity” of the arbitration agreement. The legislature went one step further and limited the scope of the appointing authority under Section 11(6A) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 to confine to the examination of only “existence” and not even “validity” of the B arbitration agreement. Such approach is consistent with the objective of expeditious resolution of arbitration disputes. A Court under Section 11(6) of Arbitration Act, 1996 is in the nature of an appointing authority, to facilitate and assist arbitration. 16.3 The statutory bar in Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899 C would be triggered only when there is a finding that the document is not duly stamped. For the same, there ought to be an inquiry into stamping. Only on triggering of Section 33(2) of the Stamp Act, 1899 titled “Examination and impounding of instruments”, Section 35 will follow. The examination under Section 33(2) of the Stamp Act, 1899 should not be undertaken by a Court under Section 11(6A) of the D Arbitration Act, 1996, but by the appointed arbitrator. 16.4. If the court finds under Section 11of the Arbitration Act, 1996 that there is no agreement, then it can take a final view. However, if the Court feels that a deeper consideration is required then the same can be left to the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 16 of the Arbitration E Act, 1996. According to Mr. Gourab Banerjee, the learned Senior Counsel, this is the appropriate way to harmonise Section 11(6A) with Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. 16.5. The absence of stamping or instrument inadequately stamped would at best be an issue of admissibility but not about jurisdiction. The F Stamp Act, 1899 is a fiscal measure enacted to secure revenue for the State for certain classes of instruments. It is, therefore, not enacted to arm a litigant with a weapon of technicality to meet the case of the opponent.
