5. Invariably, the provision of a strong criminal remedy has encouraged the institution of a large number of cases that are relatable to the offence contemplated by Section 138 of the Act. So much so, that at present a disproportionately large number of cases involving the dishonour of cheques is choking our criminal justice system, especially at the level of Magistrates' Courts……..” Further, after citing authors pointing towards compensatory jurisprudence within the NI Act, this Court observed that: “18. It is quite obvious that with respect to the offence of dishonour of cheques, it is the compensatory aspect of the remedy which should be given priority over the punitive aspect.” 12. This Court has time and again reiterated that in cases of section 138 of NI Act, the accused must try for compounding at the initial stages instead of the later stage, however, there is no bar to seek the compounding of the offence at later stages of criminal proceedings including after conviction, like the present case (See: K.M Ibrahim v. K.P Mohammed & Anr. (2010) 1 SCC 798 and O.P Dholakia v. State of Haryana & Anr. (2000) 1 SCC 762). In the case at hand, initially, both sides agreed to compound the offence at the appellate stage but the appellant could not pay the amount within the time stipulated in the agreement and the complainant now has shown her unwillingness towards compounding of the offence, despite receiving the entire amount. The appellant has paid the entire Rs.1.55 crore and further Rs.10 lacs as interest. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 211 Raj Reddy Kallem v. The State of Haryana & Anr. As far the requirement of ‘consent’ in compounding of offence under section 138 of NI Act is concerned, this Court in JIK Industries Limited & Ors. v. Amarlal V. Jamuni & Anr. (2012) 3 SCC 255 denied the suggestion of the appellant therein that ‘consent’ is not mandatory in compounding of offences under Section 138 of NI Act. This Court observed that: “57. Section 147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act reads as follows: “147.Offences to be compoundable.—Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), every offence punishable under this Act shall be compoundable.” 58. Relying on the aforesaid non obstante clause in Section 147 of the NI Act, the learned counsel for the appellant argued that a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Damodar [(2010) 5 SCC 663 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 520 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1328] , held that in view of non obstante clause in Section 147 of the NI Act, which is a special statute, the requirement of consent of the person compounding in Section 320 of the Code is not required in the case of compounding of an offence under the NI Act. 59. This Court is unable to accept the aforesaid contention for various reasons……” Further this Court observed in para 89 of the said judgement that: “Section 147 of the NI Act must be reasonably construed to mean that as a result of the said section the offences under the NI Act are made compoundable, but the main principle of such compounding, namely, the consent of the person aggrieved or the person injured or the complainant cannot be wished away nor can the same be substituted by virtue of Section 147 of the NI Act.” This Court in Meters and Instruments private Ltd.
