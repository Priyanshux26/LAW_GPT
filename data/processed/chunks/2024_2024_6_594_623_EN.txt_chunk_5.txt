The Corporation issued Notice dated 27.04.1992 under Section 68 of the Act of 1976 proposing to evict Pulkit Trust from the land. After considering the objections raised by Pulkit Trust, the Corporation informed it on 27.09.1994 that the same were not accepted. Thereupon, Pulkit Trust filed Civil Suit No. 5415 of 1994, which ultimately culminated with the dismissal of the SLP filed by it before this Court in 1995. 5. The plaintiffs further stated that, in the meantime, a public interest litigation was instituted before the High Court of Gujarat vide Special Civil Application No. 3980 of 1992. The plaintiffs also joined the litigation thereafter as necessary parties. This case was finally dismissed by the High Court on 3/4.04.1995. The plaintiffs stated that they had suffered huge monetary losses as they were deprived of the benefit of enjoying the property since 1963 and the failure of the Corporation in allotting them suitable land, at the time the scheme was implemented, amounted to failure in discharge of its statutory obligation and duty [2024] 6 S.C.R. 601 Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation under Sections 65, 68, 84 and 85 of the Act of 1976. The plaintiffs claimed that the market rate of the land allotted to the plaintiffs was about ₹150/- per sq. yd. in the year 1963 and, therefore, the value of 3890 sq. yds. would come to ₹5,83,500/-. They asserted that if this amount had been invested at 10% p.a. compound rate of interest, it would come to ₹1,63,97,673/-. They prayed for compensation of ₹1,63,97,673/-. They further stated that, the scheme was framed as per the provisions of the Act of 1976, whereby deduction of 21.40% of their land was necessitated, but they were finally allotted land with a further deduction of 974 sq. mts. illegally. They, therefore, sought allotment of that land in the alternative. 6. The Corporation filed its written statement in the suit, stating as under: The suit, as framed, was not maintainable and the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain it and grant the reliefs prayed for therein. The suit also required to be dismissed for non-joinder of parties, as the State Government had not been impleaded therein. Even on merits, the plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs prayed for. The plaintiffs were allotted Final Plot No. 187, admeasuring 2278 sq. mts., under the scheme, which had been varied after following the due procedure. As regards the shortfall of land, the plaintiffs were paid compensation @ ₹25/- per sq. mt. under the scheme itself and, as such, the plaintiffs accepted possession of Final Plot No. 187 and the compensation, in respect of the remaining area of land, without protest and without challenging the same. Therefore, it was not open to them to make out a grievance either with respect to the remaining area of land and/or the quantum of compensation. If they had any grievance with respect to the quantum of compensation, they were required to prefer an appeal under Section 54 of the Act of 1976.
