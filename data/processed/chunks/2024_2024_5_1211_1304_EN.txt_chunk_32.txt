It seems to us that acceding to the appellants’ request on the aforesaid account would also have undesirable consequences. If delay were to be condoned merely on the basis of a broad general assertion of bureaucratic indifference, without requiring demonstration of bona fide or an act of mala fide on the part of specific individuals, it would create an artificial distinction between the private parties and the government entities vis-à-vis the law of limitation. This would not be in conformity with the spirit of equality before law as guaranteed under our Constitution. Allowing such latitude would further distort incentives for the government and encourage more laxity by the bureaucracy in its general functioning, thereby undermining quality governance. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1253 Delhi Development Authority v. Tejpal & Ors. D.4. COVID-19 Pandemic 40. The fourth ground taken by the appellants is that the delay ought to be condoned on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. At this juncture, it would be apposite to discuss the series of s passed by this Court regarding the operation of limitation vis-à-vis the COVID-19 pandemic. 41. Vide dt. 23.03.2020 In Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation,42 this Court passed an omnibus extending the period of limitation for proceedings before all courts/tribunals in the country from 15.03.2020 till further s. Subsequently, vide an dt. 08.03.2021, this Court noted the lifting of the nation-wide pandemic lockdown and a return to normalcy. Accordingly, the Court brought an end to the extension and held that: “I. In computing the period of limitation for any suit, appeal, application or proceeding, the period from 15.03.2020 till 14.03.2021 shall stand excluded. Consequently, the balance period of limitation remaining as on 15.03.2020, if any, shall become available with effect from 15.03.2021. II. In cases where the limitation would have expired during the period between 15.03.2020 till 14.03.2021, notwithstanding the actual balance period of limitation remaining, all persons shall have a limitation period of 90 days from 15.03.2021. In the event the actual balance period of limitation remaining, with effect from 15.03.2021, is greater than 90 days, that longer period shall apply. III. The period from 15.03.2020 till 14.03.2021 shall also stand excluded in computing the periods prescribed under Sections 23 (4) and 29A of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and provisos (b) and (c) of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and any other laws, which prescribe period(s) of limitation for instituting proceedings, outer limits (within which the 42 (2020) 19 SCC 10, para 2. 1254 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports court or tribunal can condone delay) and termination of proceeding […]”. [emphasis supplied] 42. However, when COVID-19 cases across the country rose again, a miscellaneous application was filed and vide an dt. 27.04.2021,43 this Court restored the dated 23.03.2020 and held that the period of limitation is to be extended till further s. This came to an end on 23.09.2021 when directions to exclude the period between 15.03.2020 and 02.10.2021 from limitation were issued.44 43.
