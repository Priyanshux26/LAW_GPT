– Moreover, recommendations of Technical Expert Committee (TEC) set up by Supreme Court and Parliamentary Standing Committees’ Reports on Agriculture and on Science and Technology, Environment and Forest were not considered – Recommendations of GEAC as well as decision taken by respondent-Union of India with regard to approving environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 were vitiated and hence, quashed – Per Karol, J., held, the question of ban on HT crops is not warranted in view of the precautionary principle and it is a decision squarely within the domain of policy – Composition of GEAC was in accordance with the Rules, to which the challenge of constitutionality, has failed, and in the absence of any change in the Rules, no fault can be found with the same – Decision of GEAC to grant conditional approval is not vitiated by non-application of [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1849 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. mind, or any other principle of law, on part of the body, which itself is an expert body – Matter to be placed before Hon’ble Chief Justice of India for constituting appropriate Bench to consider said aspect afresh – Rules for the Manufacture, Use, Import, Export and Storage of Hazardous Micro-Organisms, Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells, 1989 [framed under ss.6, 8 and 25 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986] Held [per B.V. Nagarathna, J. ]: 1.1. GEAC simply recommended the environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 without any deliberation as such, which recommendation was accepted by the Central Government – All the previous deliberations and decisions of GEAC as well as the recommendations and suggestions of the sub-committee to GEAC were given a go by and totally ignored – The deferring of the field demonstration between the years 2018 to 2021, which was for valid reasons, was also ignored – There is no reason forthcoming as to why GEAC completely changed its stance in the 147th meeting held on 18.10.2022 – This resulted in the decision of the Union Government on 25.10.2022 impugned herein – There is no material put forth for the sudden decision taken by the Union Government on receiving the changed recommendation of GEAC, when earlier, it was submitted before this Court that the Union Government was still deliberating on the matter, which aspect is evident from the s passed by this Court when in fact field demonstration was also put on hold by GEAC – Such being the position from the year 2018 onwards, all of a sudden environmental release of DMH-11 was approved even in the absence of field trials for conducting studies on the impact of honeybees and other pollinators. [Paras 42.5 and 42.6] 1.2. Furthermore, while granting permission of the environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, the condition imposed was that usage of any formulation or herbicide would not be permitted for cultivation in the farmer’s field and any such use in the farmer’s field without due approval would attract appropriate legal action under various enactments – There is no indication as to how the use of any herbicide could be prevented, rather, the condition not to use any herbicide was open-ended without having any means to check whether any herbicide would be used in the farmer’s field pursuant to the environmental release – The adverse effects 1850 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
