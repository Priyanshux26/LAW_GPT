Reliance is also placed on this court’s decision in State of Rajasthan v. Mangilal Pindwal21 upheld the power of the legislature to amend repealed provisions for a period when these provisions were in operation till the date of repeal. The repealing of Section 166 of the Gujarat GST Act clearly shows that the VAT Act has not been repealed at all and hence, the consequences of repeal cannot follow. 34. It is submitted that Section 84 A is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable but aims at equity and restitution by allowing the tax authorities to collect the tax from those dealers who have passed on the burden of tax on the ultimate consumer but not paid it into the government treasury thus avoiding unjust enrichment of money as held by a special larger Constitution bench in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v. Union of India22 (hereafter, “Mafatlal Industries”). It is urged that restitution and prevention of unjust enrichment is a principle of equity applicable irrespective of any statutory provisions. Further, it is argued that Section 84 A does not impose new tax or liability, but merely facilitates the collection of tax whose burden was passed on to the ultimate consumer and that collected tax, being public money and its incidence and burden is always presumed in indirect taxes, it will be most inequitable and improper to allow some dealers to retain the benefi t of tax which has been passed on. 35. It was next urged that Section 84 A is a validating Act which increases the time limit thereby enabling the collection of public funds in the hands of the dealers of tax. The revision notices were sent after the delivered by this court in the State of Gujarat v. Reliance Industries 19 1964 (8) SCR 217; AIR 1964 SC 1729 20 1963 (2) SCR 747 21 (1996) Supp (3) SCR 98 22 1996 Suppl. (10) SCR 585 THE STATE OF TELANGANA & ORS. v. M/S TIRUMALA 167 CONSTRUCTIONS [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] Ltd23. Counsel submitted that the time limit prescribed under Section 84 A is not too long if Articles 61(b), 62, 63(b), 64, 65, 66, 67, 92, 94, 96, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110 and 136 of the Limitation Act, 1963 are viewed which provide for time limits of 12 or even 30 years from the occurrence of any event which may also take many years to occur. IV. Arguments of the respondent-assessees 36. It was argued on behalf of the assessee-respondents by Mr. Kapil Sibal, Mr. S. Ganesh, Mr Nankani and Mr Soparkar, learned Senior counsel and Mr. Sujit Ghosh, Advocate (hereafter “the assesses”) that continuance of inconsistent existing law is solely for the purposes of making them consistent (through amendments) with the amended architecture of the Constitution. It was submitted that to elucidate the ambit of powers under Section 19 of the Amendment, an inference can be drawn from Article 243ZF of the Constitution, which has been couched in a manner identical to Section 19. There are however, two distinctive features inter se between them, fi rst, being, that unlike Section 19 Article 243ZF was incorporated into the body of the Constitution, and the second is while Article 243ZF has a non-obstante clause seeking to override all Articles contained in Part IXA of the Constitution, Section 19 of the Constitutional Amendment Act, 2017 (“CAA”) only overrides the provision of the Amendment and not the Constitution of India.
