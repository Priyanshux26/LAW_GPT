Co. Ltd. (AIR 1923 PC 66); Jivrajbhai Ujameshi Sheth v Chintamanrao Balaji (1964 (5) SCR 480); Sudarshan Trading Co v Govt of Kerala (1989 (2) SCC 38); Raipur Development Authority v Chokamal Contractors (1989 ((3) SCR 144); and Santa Sila Devi v Dhirendra Nath Sen (1964 (3) SCR 410).” 24. It is also noteworthy that the scope of jurisdiction of a court, under Section 30/33 of the Act, never extended beyond discerning if the award 11 1994 Supp (2) SCR 529. 378 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. disclosed an “error apparent on the face of the award” which is an “error of law apparent on the face of the award and not an error of fact. The error of law can be discovered from the award itself or from a document actually incorporated therein.” (Refer to Trustees of Port of Madras v Engineering Constructions12). In the facts of the present case, the award did not, facially disclose any error of law; damages were awarded in accordance with principles embodied in law, and the fi ndings were based on the evidence placed before the tribunal. The ruling of the trial courts and the High Court is nothing short of intense appellate review, which is impermissible in law and beyond the courts’ jurisdiction. 25. For the above reasons, this court is of the opinion that the impugned as well as the of the trial court, cannot be sustained; they are accordingly set aside. The award is restored. The respondents shall ensure full payment in terms of the award, to the appellant, within eight weeks from today. The appeals are allowed in these terms. The appellant shall be entitled to costs throughout. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals allowed. Divya Pandey 12 1995 (Supp 2) SCR 672.
