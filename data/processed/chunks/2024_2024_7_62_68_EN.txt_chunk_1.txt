64 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 2. Brief facts of the case are that on 25.04.2016, an FIR u/s 7/13 (2) of the P.C Act was lodged against Respondent- Dr. Partap Singh Verka and another co-accused i.e. ‘Vikas’, at Police Station Vigilance Bureau, Amritsar. It was disclosed in the FIR that the present respondent was working as a doctor in Guru Nanak Hospital at the relevant point of time when complainant-Gurwinder Singh sought treatment for his brother who was in jail. The complainant alleged that on 20.04.2016 the Respondent took a bribe of Rs.10,000 from the complainant through the accused-Vikas for admitting the complainant’s brother in his hospital, as he was otherwise reluctant to treat a prisoner. Again on 24.04.2016, the respondent demanded another Rs.10,000/- to keep the patient in the hospital for further treatment and asked the complainant to give that amount to the other accused i.e. ‘Vikas’ in two installments of Rs.5,000 each. The complainant, however, contacted the Vigilance Bureau instead and the officials of Vigilance laid a trap to catch the culprits. On 25.04.2016, the accused-Vikas (ward attendant) was caught red- handed in the parking lot of the hospital receiving Rs.5000 from the complainant. On the same day, the respondent was also arrested from his office. 3. In May 2016, both the accused were released on bail. A chargesheet dated 22.12.2016 was later filed only against the other accused- Vikas. The present respondent was not named in the charge-sheet as an accused. 4. However, during the course of the trial, the complainant-Gurwinder Singh deposed as PW-1 on 12.05.2017 and in his examination- in-chief, he said that it was the present Respondent who had demanded the bribe and it was on his behalf that the other accused, Vikas had received the bribe amount. The trial Court deferred the hearing on the request of the Public Prosecutor of the State who then wanted to move an application under Section 319 of the CrPC for summoning the respondent as an accused. Consequently, an application was moved by the State on 18.05.2017 under Section 319 CrPC, which was allowed on 20.05.2017 and Dr. Partap Singh Verka was summoned to face the trial. 5. The accused Respondent challenged this of the Trial Court before the High Court which has set aside the of the Trial Court, as sanction under Section 19 of the P.C Act had not been taken. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 65 The State of Punjab v. Partap Singh Verka 6. We have heard the counsel for the Appellant-State as well as for the Respondent and have also perused the material before us. 7. There is no dispute on the fact that the Respondent is a ‘Public Servant’ as defined under Section 2(c) of the P.C Act. Section 19 of the P.C Act puts a bar on Courts to take cognizance of an offence under Sections 7, 11, 13 and 15, without the previous sanction of the State Government, Central Government or the competent authority, as the case may be.
