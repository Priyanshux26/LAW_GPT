Therefore, the moment it is found that a dealer is to be deemed to have failed to pay the tax to the extent mentioned in sub-section D (5), the penalty is automatic. Further, there is no discretion with the assessing officer either to levy or not to levy and/or to levy any penalty lesser than what is prescribed/mentioned in Section 45(6) of the Act, 1969. In that view of the matter, there is no question of considering any mens rea on the part of the assessee/ dealer. [Para 6.4][495-G-H; 496-A-C] E 2. The word used in Section 45(6) is “shall be levied”. The dealer shall be liable to pay the penalty not exceeding one and one-half times of the difference of the tax as mentioned in sub- section (5) of Section 45 of the Act, 1969. The language used in Section 45 is precise, plain and unambiguous. The intention of F the legislature is very clear and unambiguous that the moment any eventuality as mentioned in Section 45(5) occurs, the penalty shall be leviable as mentioned in sub-section (6) of Section 45. No other word like mens rea and/or satisfaction of the assessing officer and/or other language is used like in Section 11AC of the G Central Excise Act. It is a well settled principle in law that the Court cannot read anything into a statutory provision which is plain and unambiguous. A statute is an edict of the legislature. The language employed in a statute is the determinative factor of legislative intent. As per the settled position of law, the intention of the legislature is primarily to be gathered from the language H STATE OF GUJARAT AND ANR. v. M/s. SAW PIPES LTD. 481 used, which means that attention should be paid to what has been A said as also to what has not been said. The courts cannot aid the legislatures’ defective phrasing of an Act; they cannot add or mend, and by construction make up deficiencies which are left there. [Para 6.11][501-E-H; 502-A] 3. On strict interpretation of Section 45 and Section 47 of B the Act, 1969, the only conclusion would be that the penalty and interest leviable under Section 45 and 47(4A) of the Act, 1969 are statutory and mandatory and there is no discretion vested in the Commissioner/Assessing Officer to levy or not to levy the penalty and interest other than as mentioned in Section 45(6) C and Section 47 of the Act, 1969. It is needless to observe that such an interpretation has been made having regard to the tenor of Sections 45 and 47 of the Act, 1969 and the language used therein.
