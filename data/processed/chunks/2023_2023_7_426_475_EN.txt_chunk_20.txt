So far F as the Karnataka Amendment Act is concerned, in the definition clauses of “Bulls Race or Bullock Cart Race” and “Kambala”, they have been described as part of tradition and culture of the State. In the Maharashtra Act also the source of Bullock Cart Race has been identified to be the tradition and culture of specified parts of that State in the definition clause of Bullock Cart Race. G 17.The argument of the petitioners and the interveners supporting in substance the ban on performance of these sports have been that the Statutes seek to validate the provisions that were held to be illegal by this Court without curing the defects outlined in the of A. Nagaraja (supra). In such circumstances, the Amendment Acts could H 460 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A not be held to be in exercise of legitimate legislative power in the light of the constitutional provisions and these enactments are colourable legislations.

Corollary submissions of the petitioners are that after Presidential assent was given to the three Statutes, they legitimised the three aforesaid events but the manner in which they are conducted is contrary to the provisions of Sections 3, 11(1)(a) and (m) as was held in the A. Nagaraja (supra) case. Hence, the attempt of the Amendment Acts is to override a judicial verdict without addressing G the grounds on which this Court had found Jallikattu and Bullock Cart Race in the States of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra respectively to be in violation of the 1960 Act.
