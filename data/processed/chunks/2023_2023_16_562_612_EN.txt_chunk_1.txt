[Para 54] 564 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Role of the adjudicating authority in applications under Part II and Part III: Held: Bearing in mind the clear diff erences between the CIRP under Part II and insolvency resolution process for individuals and partnership under Part III, the legislature has carefully calibrated the role of the resolution professional; the imposition of the moratorium; and the stage at which the adjudicating authority steps in under Part II, on one hand, and Part III, on the other – This is based on an intelligible diff erentia between the nature of the insolvency resolution process in the case of a corporate debtor, on one hand, and individuals or partnerships, on the other. [Paras 60, 61] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.99 – Process before the resolution professional, if ex parte: Held: No – The provisions of s.99 leave no manner of doubt that the process which takes place before the resolution professional is not an ex parte process in the absence of a debtor against whom the insolvency resolution process is sought to be initiated – Though, the ultimate report of the resolution professional has only a recommendatory value, the legislature has ensured that the recommendation is made after taking into account the information or, as the case may be, the explanation that is furnished by the debtor – Thus, it cannot be said that there is any element of bias in a report submitted by an RP who is nominated by the creditor. [Para 67] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Professionals) Regulations, 2016 r/w para 21 of the First Schedule – Plea of the petitioners that the resolution professional is empowered to direct the personal guarantor and others to disclose sensitive personal information without a prior hearing and this demand for information, lacking an opportunity for the personal guarantor to be heard, raises concerns about violating the right to privacy: Held: The resolution professional is only entitled to seek information strictly relevant to the examination of the application for IRP – Further, regulation 7(2)(h) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Professionals) Regulations, 2016 r/w para 21 of the First Schedule, casts an obligation on the resolution professional to ensure DILIP B JIWRAJKA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS 565 confi dentiality of all information relating to the insolvency process – The BLRC also acknowledges the information imbalance between debtors and creditors, necessitating the resolution professional’s investigative role in individual insolvency – Therefore, s.99 empowers the resolution professional to seek information – The right to privacy is subject to reasonable restraints – In the context of s.99(4), the legitimate aims of establishing a comprehensive framework for individual insolvency and aiding the adjudicating authority justify seeking personal fi nancial information, balancing privacy rights with the objective. [Para 70] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Role of the Adjudicating Authority – Plea of the petitioners that the adjudicating authority must be required to determine jurisdictional question like whether a debt exists or whether the relationship of debtor and creditor subsists, at the threshold: Held: The adjudicating authority conducts an independent assessment, not solely relying on the resolution professional’s report, to decide the fate of applications u/ss.94 or 95 – The true adjudicatory function of the authority commences u/s.100 after the submission of the report – What is described as a jurisdictional question by the petitioners may not be a simple matter to be decided as a question of law – The jurisdictional questions of the nature suggested by the petitioners, namely, on whether there is a subsisting debt or whether the relationship of debtor and creditor subsists, would involve a decision on mixed questions of law and fact – The entire scheme of ss.99 and 100 implicates time lines laid down by Parliament – The entire process of implementing these time lines would be rendered nugatory if an adjudicatory role were to be read into the provisions of s.97(5) – The provisions of s.99 do not as such implicate any adverse civil consequences particularly if those provisions are read in the manner in which we now propose to elucidate.
