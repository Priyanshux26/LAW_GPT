No.20650 of 2023 about the issues concerning the Corbett National Park on the 11th and 12th of January 2024. 2. A perusal of report of the CEC, which is numbered as I.A. No.20650 of 2023 as well as other reports submitted by various authorities, which were also taken into consideration by the CEC in its report, depicts a bleak picture of things in the Corbett National Park which is one of the first National Parks established in India. The reports make it clear that some of the Forest officers have blatantly resorted to illegal felling of trees, proceeding with construction activities in flagrant disregard of the provisions of the law and s of this Court. We therefore decided to treat this as a test case and determine as to what directions are necessary to be issued, so that in future, such illegal activities are not repeated and as to what measures are required to be resorted to for protecting the precious wildlife. 3. We extensively heard Mr. K. Parameshwar, learned Amicus Curiae, Mr. A.N.S. Nadkarni, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of Uttarakhand, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Union of India and Mr. Gaurav Kumar Bansal, applicant-in-person.
