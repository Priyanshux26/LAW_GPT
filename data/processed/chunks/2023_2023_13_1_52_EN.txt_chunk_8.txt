SLP(Crl.) No.4364 of 2011 8. Leave granted. 9. This appeal has been fi led by the appellant assailing the correctness of the and of the Bombay High Court passed in Criminal Application No.1913 of 2010, titled Manjit Singh Bali vs. Central Bureau of Investigation dated 29.11.2010. By the above , the Bombay High Court dismissed the petition praying for quashing of the FIR registered by CBI against the petitioner therein under Sections 7 and 8 of the PC Act, 1988. In this case, an FIR was registered on 18.02.2010 based on a complaint dated 16.02.2010. A raid was conducted on 24.02.2010, during which the petitioner therein was arrested and cash was recovered from his car. In this case also the issue is as to whether in the facts of the said case, Section 6A(1) of DSPE Act would be applicable or Section 6A(2) thereof would be applicable. ARGUMENTS: A. For CBI: 10. Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appearing for the appellant-CBI in Criminal Appeal No.377 of 2007 made detailed submissions which are briefl y summarized hereunder: 10.1. Section 6A of the DSPE Act is a mere procedural provision and not a penal provision as such would not attract Article 20(1) of the Constitution. Article 20 of the Constitution applies only to those provisions of law in force, violation of which results in conviction and resultantly awarding sentence. Procedural issues like statutory protection during trial, a provision providing for a particular Court to try the off ence would not have any bearing while invoking Article 20 of the Constitution. 10.2. Article 20 of the Constitution would have no applicability in determining whether the declaration made in the case of Subramanian Swamy CBI v. R.R. KISHORE 13 [VIKRAM NATH, J.] (supra) would be prospective or retrospective. The protection provided under Article 20 of the Constitution against ex post facto law extends and confi nes only to conviction and sentence and would have no relevance for procedural aspects and also would not have any applicability to the powers exercised during the course of the investigation. He enlisted the following aspects in this respect: (a) Article 20 is limited in application wherein distinct off ences are created subsequently; (b) The other aspect of Article 20 is debarring infl iction of greater penalty, post commission of the off ence; (c) Section 6A did not decriminalise PC Act off ences and removal of the said provision, therefore, does not create a new off ence; (d) Section 6A did not provide any blanket immunity against anti-corruption laws and therefore, removal of the same does not create a new off ence; (e) Section 6A did not create any vested right which can be said to be covered by Article 20; (f) Declaration of Section 6A as invalid and unconstitutional is through a judicial and not a legislative measure. ; 10.3. Reliance is placed upon the following s in support of the above propositions: (1) Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh and another Vs. State of Vindhya Pradesh5; (2) State of West Bengal Vs. S.K.
