All these petitions have been filed only thereafter which may not be maintainable stricto sensu having regard to the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Aflatoon v. Lt. Governor of Delhi [(1975) 4 SCC 285: AIR 1974 SC 2077] and the dictum of this is followed consistently by this Court in various cases (see Murari v. Union of India [(1997) 1 SCC 15], Ravi Khullar v. Union of India [(2007) 5 SCC 231] and Anand Singh v. State of U.P. [(2010) 11 SCC 242 : (2010) 4 SCC (Civ) 423]).” [emphasis supplied] 35. In Savitri Devi (supra), this Court considering the peculiar circumstances and the intent of the High Court’s to provide increased compensation, seconded the grant of that relief in the larger public interest.21 This is explicitly observed by this Court noting that: 19 W.P. No. 37443/2011. 20 [2015] 7 SCR 512 : (2015) 7 SCC 21 21 Ibid, para 43 and 46. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1023 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. Darshan Lal Bohra & Ors. “50. Keeping in view all these peculiar circumstances, we are of the opinion that these are not the cases where this Court should interfere under Article 136 of the Constitution. However, we make it clear that directions of the High Court are given in the aforesaid unique and peculiar/ specific background and, therefore, it would not form precedent for future cases.” [emphasis supplied] 36. Having held so, we further find that there are several respondents in this batch of appeals who had raised the objection; did not accept any compensation; and their names were duly recorded in the land records when the notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act was published. Since each one of them has an indefeasible right to seek compliance of the procedure engrafted under Section 5A, we shall now proceed to analyse whether the Collector faithfully complied with the said provision in these cases. D.2. Compliance with Section 5A of the 1894 Act 37. It may be recapitulated that according to the High Court, the Collector failed to adhere to the mandate of Section 5A as no record of authenticity as to how effectively the Gram Pradhan intimated all tenure holders, was produced. This was sufficient to infer that the respondent-landowners were not properly informed the date of personal hearing; their objections were treated as an empty formality since the Collector disposed them by consolidating in groups; and there are doubts about the procedural fairness as the Collector attempted to rectify an earlier by issuing a corrigendum. To ascertain whether the High Court rightly attained these conclusions, we shall deal with each of these issues separately. D.2.1. Presumption regarding notices not being served 38. It is timeworn law that the person who submits objections under Section 5A must be accorded an opportunity of personal hearing. Such a hearing must precede with an advance notice served upon the objector. As a necessary corollary, the failure to serve the notice would be sufficient to infer the defiance of Section 5A of the 1894 Act.
