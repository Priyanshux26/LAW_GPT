The Appellants filed a Civil Misc. Review Application No.355 of 2022, but the review petition was also dismissed on 22.09.2022. 3.7. The Appellants are before this Court challenging the aforesaid s of the High Court and seek restoration of their right to carry on their business in accordance with their valid license and the statutory provisions. 4. The learned counsel for the Appellants, Shri Nikhil Goel, advanced the following arguments: 4.1. The learned counsel for the Appellants contends that the High Court erred in categorizing aromatic tincture of cardamom as a “prohibited article.” According to the Appellants, no such prohibition exists under the D&C Act, 1940, or any notification issued thereunder. Section 26A of the D&C Act, 1940 empowers only the Central Government to regulate, restrict, or prohibit the sale and distribution of any drug in the public interest. There being no notification prohibiting this particular tincture, the Respondent authorities have no jurisdiction to treat it as a banned substance. 4.2. The Appellants argue that the impugned s passed by the Respondent authorities and the High Court’s endorsement of 2106 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports such actions infringe their fundamental right to carry on a lawful trade or business under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. They stress that they possess a valid license and are in compliance with all applicable regulations. 4.3. The Appellants further submit that repeated inspections, arbitrary interference, and harassment by the Respondent authorities are motivated by extraneous reasons, including retaliation for complaints made against officials demanding bribes. The unlawful actions have resulted in closure of their shops, causing significant financial loss and damage to their reputation. 4.4. The Appellants emphasize that the tincture in question is a regulated drug, commonly used for minor digestive ailments, and does not figure in any list of prohibited or banned medicines. Multiple RTI responses from different governmental departments have confirmed that aromatic tincture of cardamom is a licensed medicine and does not require a doctor’s prescription. In these circumstances, the restriction placed by the Respondent authorities is wholly unjustified and arbitrary. 5. In response, the learned counsel for the Respondent Authorities, Mr. Samar Vijay Singh, urged the following contentions: 5.1. The Respondent authorities, while denying any mala fide intent, contend that aromatic cardamom tincture has extremely high alcohol content (around 84% to 87% v/v). According to them, the substance is being misused as a cheap substitute for country liquor by vulnerable sections of society, including daily-wage earners and rickshaw pullers. They argue that large quantities of this tincture are sold by the Appellants’ shop without proper records or the presence of a registered pharmacist, and no other medicines are reportedly being sold. 5.2. The Respondent authorities insist that the manner of sale and the demographics of the customers indicate that the tincture is effectively being used as an intoxicant rather than a medicinal preparation. They claim that its indiscriminate consumption poses serious health hazards and may lead to untimely deaths. They further submit that the misuse is causing substantial revenue losses to the State, as the tincture is replacing taxed country liquor.
