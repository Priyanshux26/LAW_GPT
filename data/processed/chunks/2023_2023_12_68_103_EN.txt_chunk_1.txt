[Paras 21, 23, 27-30, 37, 40 and 44] Constitution of India – Powers of Supreme Court and High Courts, part of Basic Structure: Held: Powers of Supreme Court and the High Courts vested under the Constitution cannot be abridged, excluded or taken away, being part of the Basic Structure of the Constitution. [Para 16] Alternative remedy – No bar for exercise of writ jurisdiction – Ladakh Autonomous Hill Devel-opment Councils Act, 1997 – s.13: Held: The availability of alternative effi cacious remedy is no bar to the exercise of high prerogative writ jurisdiction – s.13, 1997 Act does not, and cannot, impede a Constitutional Court from proceeding further – High Court was not precluded from issuing a direction of the nature issued by it, more so when such direction does not violate any statutory provision – Constitution of India – Election Laws. [Para 16] Practice and Procedure – Inter-departmental communications – Reliance upon: Held: Inter-departmental communications are in the process of consideration for appropriate decision and cannot be relied upon as a basis to claim any right – In the present case, it was rightly contended that the Legal Opinion by the Law Department remains internal advice, and advice alone, and the same would not create/confer any right in favour of R1 – Elections – Administrative Law. [Para 17] 70 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. Constitution of India – Article 226 – Power to direct for actions, in rare and exceptional situation, not mentioned in the provisions concerned – Discussed. Elections – Election authority, to be independent of any extraneous infl uence: Held: Elections to any offi ce/body are required to be free, fair and transparent – Elections lie at the core of democracy – The authority entrusted by law to conduct such elections is to be completely in- dependent of any extraneous infl uence/consideration – In the present case, the Union Territory of Ladakh not only denied R1 the Plough symbol, but even upon timely intervention by the Single Judge, left no stone unturned not only to resist but also frustrate a cause simply by effl ux of time. [Para 22] Elections – Power of Supreme court to bring back status quo ante: Held: Plea of the Appellants that no relief be granted to R1 due to the election process having reached the penultimate stage, rejected – Having chosen to not comply with successive s of the High Court which were passed well in time, such as not to stall/delay the notifi ed election schedule, the Appellants cannot be permitted to plead that interference by Supreme Court at this late juncture should not be forthcoming – No litigant should have even an iota of doubt or misimpression that just because of systemic delay or the matter not being taken up by the Courts resulting in effl ux of time the cause would be defeated, and the Court would be rendered helpless to ensure justice to the party concerned – This Court can even turn the clock back, if the situation warrants such dire measures – Powers of this Court, if need be, to even restore status quo ante are not in the realm of any doubt, as held in Nabam Rebia and Bamang Felix v. Deputy Speaker, Aurnachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly reported as [2016] 6 SCR 1 – Though, Nabam Rebia has been referred to a Larger Bench in Subhash Desai v. Principal Secretary, Governor of Maharashtra however, the questions referred to the Larger Bench do not detract from the aforesaid power and furthermore, mere reference to a larger Bench does not unsettle declared UNION TERRITORY OF LADAKH v. JAMMU AND 71 KASHMIR NATIONAL CONFERENCE law – Constitution of India – Practice and Procedure – Reference to larger Bench does not unsettle declared law.
