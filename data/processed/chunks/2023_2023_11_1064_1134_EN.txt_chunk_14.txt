27. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned Senior Counsel prayed that there being merit in his appeal, the same be allowed and the impugned and of the High Court be set aside. BALWANTBHAI SOMABHAI BHANDARI v. HIRALAL 1085 SOMABHAI CONTRACTOR (DECEASED) REP. BY LRS. & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] 28. Mr. Mihir Joshi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants in the Civil Appeal No. 5041 of 2022 made the following submissions: (a) The High Court has erred in not accepting the apology tendered by the appellants on the ground that it was not tendered at the fi rst instance. Notice in Form-I was issued on 23.04.2018. After issuance of notice, the very fi rst affi davit of the appellant dated 24.08.2018 contains an unconditional apology. A further affi davit dated 24.12.2018 also off ers unconditional apology. The apology being genuine as is evident from the facts of the case and tendered at the fi rst instance ought to have been accepted by the Court. The High Court rendered a factually incorrect fi nding in para 49 (iv) that there was no unconditional apology tendered at the fi rst instance so as to construe the acts of the accused as not being deliberate or wilful. The High Court erred in holding in para 38 of its impugned that the fi rst affi davit dated 28.08.2018 did not contain an unconditional apology, which is factually incorrect. The said affi davit dated 28.08.2018 tendered an unconditional apology. (b) In fact, the contempt proceedings were not maintainable at all since the statement recorded on behalf of the appellant in the dated 14.10.2015 is neither an of the Court nor an undertaking given to the Court and therefore, there could be no breach thereof, amounting to civil contempt as contemplated under section 2(b) of the Act 1971. It is self-evident that the statement is an assurance to the other party and not an undertaking to the court. Breach of such statement may invite an action for restitution by the opposite party which would have to be adjudicated in duly constituted proceedings, but it would not invite proceedings for contempt since it is neither an of the court nor an undertaking to the court. This distinction is well known and accepted by Courts and the contempt application ought to have been dismissed as not maintainable only on this ground 1086 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. (c) The High Court clearly erred in holding that breach of the statement recorded in the dated 14.10.2015 (assuming the same is considered as an undertaking contemplated under Section 2(b) of the Act 1971) was a wilful and deliberate breach, overlooking the following facts: (i) The Court has erred in disbelieving the explanation tendered by the Appellants regarding the necessity of the sales since the subject transfers had been concluded with full payment of consideration and handing over of possession vide the possession receipts much prior to 14.10.2015 and therefore, the transfers were not covered by the statement recorded on 14.10.2015.
