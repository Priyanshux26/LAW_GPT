Nagarathna and Nongmeikapam Kotiswar Singh,* JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the mobile service providers who pay excise duties on various items for setting up their business more particularly for erection of mobile towers and peripherals like pre-fabricated buildings etc. can take the benefit of CENVAT Credit under the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 for the purpose of payment of service tax on the output services rendered by them. Headnotes† CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 – Rules 3, 2(k), 2(a)(A)(i), (iii) – “inputs”; “goods”/“capital goods” – General Clauses Act – ss.3(36), 3(26) – Transfer of Property Act, 1882 – s.3 – Mobile Service Providers (MSPs), if entitled to CENVAT credit on mobile towers and prefabricated buildings (PFBs) – Conflicting views of the High Court of Bombay and Delhi: Held: Applying the tests of permanency, intendment, functionality and marketability, it is evident that mobile towers and PFBs are not immovable but movable within the meaning of Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act, r/w Section 3(36) of the General Clause Act – Considering the nature of annexation of the tower to the earth, it is seen that the annexation is not for permanent annexation to the land or the building as the tower can be removed or relocated without causing damage to it – The attachment of the tower to the building or the land is not for the permanent enjoyment of the building or the land – Further, the tower is fixed to the land or building for enhancing the operational efficacy and proper functioning of the antenna which is fixed on the tower by making it stable and wobble free The fact that the tower, if required can be removed, dismantled in the Completely knocked down condition * Author 1526 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and Semi-knocked down condition and sold in the market is not disputed – Mobile towers and PFBs are movable properties and hence, “goods” – Towers and shelters (PFBs) support the Base Transceiver System (BTS)/antenna for effective transmission of mobile signals and thus, enhance their efficiency and since these articles are components/accessories of BTS/antenna which are admittedly “capital goods” falling under Chapter 85 within sub-clause (i) of Rule 2(a)(A) of CENVAT Rules, these items consequently are covered by the definition of “capital goods” within the meaning of sub-clause (iii) read with sub-clause (i) of Rule 2(a)(A) of CENVAT Rules – Further, since these are used for providing output service, i.e., mobile telecommunication service, and since these are “capital goods” received in the premises of the provider of output service as contemplated under Rule 3(1)(i), the Assessees would be entitled to CENVAT credit on the excise duties paid on these goods – Thus, tower and the PFBs are not immovable property but are “goods”/ “capital goods” within the meaning of Rule 2(a) (A)(iii) and since these are used for providing output service, these can be considered to be “inputs” within the meaning of Rule 2(k) – CENVAT credit can be availed in respect of these goods for payment of service tax – Any item so long it qualifies as a “good” and is “used” for providing output service, would come within the purview of “input” under Rule 2(k) and excise duty paid on such items can be claimed as CENVAT credit which may in turn be used for payment of service tax for the output service provided by the MSPs – of the Delhi High Court in Vodafone Mobile Services Limited v.
