(ii) The respondent(s) are eligible in terms of the aforesaid clarifi cations; (iii) The argument that to be considered recognised, an institution must have recognition from the Takniki Board has been raised for the fi rst time in rejoinder before this Court, therefore, it cannot be entertained at this stage; (iv) The appointments under Post Code 556 were subject to the outcome of the litigation, therefore the appointees have no right to challenge the decision of the High Court; (v) The prescribed essential qualifi cation is in fact a non-essential qualifi cation, inasmuch as selection is made after undergoing rigorous selection process such as written test, typing test and interview. Therefore, Diploma is not an essential qualifi cation; (vi) The term recognized institution occurring in the 2014 Rules is ambiguous and, therefore, required clarifi cation. In this regard, reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in Dhananjay Malik vs. State of Uttaranchal22 ; (vii) Rule 18 conferred power on the State to relax the Rules. Consultation with Public Service Commission was not required because under the proviso to Article 320 (3) of the Constitution, “The Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission (Exemption from Consultation) Regulations, 1973” were framed and, as per Regulation 3 thereof, there is exemption from consultation in respect of services and posts specifi ed in the Schedule. Class III posts, other than those specifi ed, are exempt from consultation. Thus, relaxation without consultation with the Commission was legally permissible. In this regard, reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in the case of State of Gujarat vs. Arvindkumar T. Tiwari23. 18. On behalf of the State of Himachal Pradesh, H.P.
