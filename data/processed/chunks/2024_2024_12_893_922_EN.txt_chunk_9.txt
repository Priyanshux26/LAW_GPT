18. It would, therefore, be relevant to examine the HSN in the context of the changes made in the First Schedule to the Act of 1985 in 2005 apropos ‘coconut oil’. Section III and Chapter 15 in the HSN are titled the same as Section III and Chapter 15 in the First Schedule and read thus: SECTION III ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE FATS AND OILS AND THEIR CLEAVAGE PRODUCTS; PREPARED EDIBLE FATS; ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE WAXES CHAPTER 15 ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE FATS AND OILS AND THEIR CLEAVAGE PRODUCTS; PREPARED EDIBLE FATS; ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE WAXES 4 [2008] 12 SCR 1223 : (2008) 9 SCC 82 908 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Chapter Notes. 1. - This Chapter does not cover: (a) to (d) … (e) Fatty acids, prepared waxes, medicaments, paints, varnishes, soap, perfumery, cosmetic or toilet preparations, sulphonated oils or other goods of Section VI; or (f) … 19. Heading 15.13 in the HSN is identical to Heading 1513 in Chapter 15 in Section III of the First Schedule, after its amendment, and reads thus: 15.13 – COCONUT (COPRA), PALM KERNEL OR BABASSU OIL AND FRACTIONS THEREOF, WHETHER OR NOT REFINED, BUT NOT CHEMICALLY MODIFIED. - Coconut (copra) oil and its fractions: 1513.11 - - Crude oil 1513.19 - - Other - Palm kernel or babassu oil and fractions thereof: 1513.21 - - Crude oil 1513.29 - - Other (A) COCONUT (COPRA) OIL This oil is obtained from the dried flesh or copra (as it is called) of the coconut (Cocos nucifera). Fresh coconut flesh can also be used. This non-drying oil is pale yellow or colourless and is solid below 250C. Coconut oil is used in soaps, in cosmetic or toilet preparations, for making lubricating greases, synthetic detergents, laundering or cleaning preparations and as a source of fatty acids, fatty alcohols and methyl esters. Refined coconut oil is edible and is used for food products such as margarine, dietary supplements. 20. Section VI of the HSN is titled ‘Products of the Chemical or Allied Industries’ as is Section VI in the First Schedule to the Act of 1985. Section Note 2 therein reads as follows: [2024] 12 S.C.R. 909 Commissioner of Central Excise, Salem v. M/s Madhan Agro Industries (India) Private Ltd. SECTION VI PRODUCTS OF THE CHEMICAL OR ALLIED INDUSTRIES Section Notes. 1. … 2. - Subject to Note 1 above, goods classifiable in heading 30.04, 30.05, 30.06, 32.12, 33.03, 33.04, 33.05, 33.06, 33.07, 35.06, 37.07 or 38.08 by reason of being put up in measured doses or for retail sale are to be classified in those headings and in no other heading of the Nomenclature. It is, therefore, identical to the amended Section Note 2 in Section VI in the First Schedule to the Act of 1985. The General Note under Section Note 2 in the HSN is of relevance and reads as follows: Section Note 2 provides that goods (other than those described in headings 28.43 to 28.46) which are covered by heading 30.04, 30.05, 30.06, 32.12, 33.03, 33.04, 33.05, 33.06, 33.07, 35.06, 37.07 or 38.08 by reason of being put up in measured doses or for retail sale, are to be classified in those headings notwithstanding that they could also fall in some other heading of the Nomenclature.
