While lending his support to the abovementioned arguments, he made the following submissions – Firstly, that the issue of applicable YADAIAH AND ANR. v. STATE OF TELANGANA AND 627 OTHERS [SURYA KANT, J.] law over the Subject Land can no longer be opened in light of the High Court’s dated 21.04.2006 wherein it was categorically held that the State could not agitate over the applicability of correct regulatory regime after a gap of 30 years post assignment. According to him, the Laoni Rules of 1950 were held to be applicable over the Subject Land. In support of this, he also referred to the Mandal Revenue Offi cer’s clarifi cation vide his memo dated 23.09.1992. Secondly, he took pains to go through the entirety of sale deeds executed by M.A. Baksh to point out that out of the originally assigned area measuring 142 Acres 39 Guntas, only about 10 Acres land was sold through these sale deeds. In other words, the contravention of provisions of 1977 Act was limited to this area and an of resumption could not have been passed in respect of the entire Subject Land. Lastly, he submitted that even if the Subject Land is resumed, the Appellants are entitled to compensation as per the Seven-Judge bench decision of the High Court in LAO cum Revenue Divisional Offi cer, Chevella Division v Mekala Pandu10, read with the right to property duly protected under Article 300A of the Constitution. 32. Supplementing the Appellants, Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel raised the following contentions – Firstly, that in the counter affi davit fi led by the impleaded Respondent, i.e. Greyhounds, a plea has been taken that they have taken possession of the Subject Land in 2003 itself. If this was the case, then where was the need to issue the Second SCN in 2006 and to take this contrary stance by them. Secondly, he contended that in all the sale deeds entered by M.A. Baksh as a GPA holder, he is mentioned as the vendee which showcases that the Appellants were unaware or were not actively involved in carrying out sale of the Subject Land. 33. In the end, Mr. Tripurari Ray learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants raised a contention for the fi rst time at this stage by relying on the decision of this Court in Yeshwant Deorao Deshmukh v Walchand Ramchand Kothari11. He contended that the Laoni Rules of 1950 created an artifi cial classifi cation among two classes – namely those who were 10 LAO cum Revenue Divisional Offi cer, Chevella Division v Mekala Pandu 2004 SCC OnLine AP 217. 11 Yeshwant Deorao Deshmukh v Walchand Ramchand Kothari 1950 SCC 766. 628 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. granted regular patta under Rule 2 to 14 of these Rules through the bidding process which was alienable and the landless or poor people who were granted special patta under Rule 15 to 24 of Laoni Rules of 1950 with a bar on the alienability and obligation of an Assignee to cultivate the land.
