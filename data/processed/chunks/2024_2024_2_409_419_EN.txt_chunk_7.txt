In the alternative, we may also [2024] 2 S.C.R. 419 Manoj Kumar v. Union of India & Ors. formulate a reasonable equivalent for restitution of the wrongful action. 25. Returning to the facts of the present case, in exercise of our primary duty, we have set aside the action of the respondents as being illegal and arbitrary. In furtherance of our duty to provide a reasonable measure for restitution, we have explored the possibility of directing the Institute to appoint the appellant as a primary teacher in any other school run by them. However, it seems that the only primary school run by the Institute is the one for which they sought to fill vacancies and it is closed since 2023. In this situation, we must consider an alternative restitutory measure in the form of monetary compensation. 26. We appreciate the spirit of the appellant who has steadfastly contested his case like the legendary Vikram,10 from the year 2017 when he was illegally denied the appointment by the executive dated 22.05.2017, which we have set aside as being illegal and arbitrary. In these circumstances, we direct the Institute (respondent no. 2) to pay an amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- as compensation. This amount shall be paid to the appellant within a period of six weeks from the date of passing of this . 27. For the reasons stated above, we allow the appeal and set aside the of the High Court in W.P. (C) No. 5279 of 2017 and C.M. No. 22382 of 2017 dated 24.01.2018 and in L.P.A. No. 158 of 2018 dated 16.10.2018 and direct the Institute (respondent no. 2) to pay Rs. 1,00,000/- as a compensation with cost quantified at Rs. 25,000/-.
