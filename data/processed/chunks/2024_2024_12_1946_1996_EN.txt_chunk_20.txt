This Court while answering the issue in the negative, applied the doctrine of separate corporate personality and held that it is only the drawer of the cheque who could be held to be liable for the payment of interim compensation under Section 143A of the NI Act and the authorised signatory of a company cannot be said to be the drawer of the cheque. The relevant observations made by the Court are reproduced hereinbelow: “13. The appellant has challenged the and of the High Court dated March 29, 2023 as well as the relied upon and dated March 8, 2023. The present appeal is filed assailing the correctness of these 1976 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports s vis-a-vis the larger question of law, as framed by the High Court: “Whether the signatory of the cheque, authorised by the ‘company’, is the ‘drawer’ and whether such signatory could be directed to pay interim compensation in terms of section 143A of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 leaving aside the company?” xxx xxx xxx 28. The High Court’s interpretation of section 7 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 accurately identified the “drawer” as the individual who issues the cheque. This interpretation is fundamental to understanding the obligations and liabilities under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which makes it clear that the drawer must ensure sufficient funds in their account at the time the cheque is presented. The appellants’ argument that directors or other individuals should also be liable under section 143A misinterprets the statutory language and intent. The primary liability, as correctly observed by the High Court, rests on the drawer, emphasizing the drawer’s responsibility for maintaining sufficient funds. 29. The general rule against vicarious liability in criminal law underscores that individuals are not typically held criminally liable for acts committed by others unless specific statutory provisions extend such liability. Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is one such provision, extending liability to the company’s officers for the dishonour of a cheque. The appellants’ attempt to extend this principle to section 143A, to hold directors or other individuals personally liable for interim compensation, is unfounded. The High Court rightly emphasised that liability under section 141 arises from the conduct or omission of the individual involved, not merely their position within the company. 30. The distinction between legal entities and individuals acting as authorized signatories is crucial. Authorised [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1977 Bijoy Kumar Moni v. Paresh Manna & Anr. signatories act on behalf of the company but do not assume the company’s legal identity. This principle, fundamental to corporate law, ensures that while authorised signatories can bind the company through their actions, they do not merge their legal status with that of the company. This distinction supports the High Court’s interpretation that the drawer under section 143A refers specifically to the issuer of the cheque, not the authorised signatories. 31. The principle of statutory interpretation, particularly in relation to sections 143A and 148, was also correctly applied by the High Court.
