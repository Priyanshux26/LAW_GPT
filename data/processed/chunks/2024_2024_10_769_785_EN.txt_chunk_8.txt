Digital Supreme Court Reports the evidence of P.W.7, Doctor, who performed the autopsy. The law on minor discrepancies which does not affect the basic case of the prosecution, is well settled. This Court in C. Muniappan v. State of Tamil Nadu7 has stated as under: “85. It is settled proposition of law that even if there are some omissions, contradictions and discrepancies, the entire evidence cannot be disregarded. After exercising care and caution and sifting through the evidence to separate truth from untruth, exaggeration and improvements, the court comes to a conclusion as to whether the residuary evidence is sufficient to convict the accused. Thus, an undue importance should not be attached to omissions, contradictions and discrepancies which do not go to the heart of the matter and shake the basic version of the prosecution›s witness. As the mental abilities of a human being cannot be expected to be attuned to absorb all the details of the incident, minor discrepancies are bound to occur in the statements of witnesses. (Vide Sohrab v. State of M.P. [(1972) 3 SCC 751 : 1972 SCC (Cri) 819 : AIR 1972 SC 2020], State of U.P. v. M.K. Anthony [(1985) 1 SCC 505 : 1985 SCC (Cri) 105], Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat [(1983) 3 SCC 217 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 728 : AIR 1983 SC 753], State of Rajasthan v. Om Prakash [(2007) 12 SCC 381 : (2008) 1 SCC (Cri) 411], Prithu v. State of H.P. [(2009) 11 SCC 588 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 1502], State of U.P. v. Santosh Kumar [(2009) 9 SCC 626 : (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 88] and State v. Saravanan [(2008) 17 SCC 587 : (2010) 4 SCC (Cri) 580]. )” 16. That apart, the acquittal of the appellant under section 25/27 of the Arms Act on a technical ground that the of sanction by the District Magistrate was rejected as there was no date in the , cannot come to the aid of the appellant as the extent of proof and procedures for prosecution are different. In the instant case, the charge of murder framed against the appellant stood proved, as narrated above. Insofar as the claim that when the other accused have been 7 [2010] 10 SCR 262 : (2010) 9 SCC 567 : (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 1402 : 2010 SCC OnLine SC 946 at page 596 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 781 Sandeep v. State of Uttarakhand acquitted for the same offence, the appellant cannot be convicted, we do not agree with the same. It is proved beyond doubt that the victim died due to gunshot. The presence of the other accused with the alleged weapons was not proved and the victim was not inflicted with any other form of injury. Therefore, the benefit of doubt granted to the other accused, who were acquitted, cannot be extended to the appellant. Accordingly, the conviction under section 302 IPC is confirmed. 17. Insofar as the conviction under section 34 IPC, there is a contradiction in the evidence of the Investigating Officer and the other witnesses on instigation.
