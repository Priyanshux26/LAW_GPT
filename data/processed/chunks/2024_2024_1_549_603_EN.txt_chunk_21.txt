31. In the case of State through Central Bureau of Investigation, New Delhi -vs- Jitender Kumar Singh [(2014) 11 SCC 724] certain persons who were not public servants were being tried with a public servant in relation to offences outside the purview of the 1988 Act. The public servant however was implicated in offences under the aforesaid statute. It has been held and observed in this :- “46. We may now examine Criminal Appeal No. 161 of 2011, where the FIR was registered on 2-7-1996 and the charge-sheet was filed before the Special Judge on 14-9- 2001 for the offences under Sections 120-B, 420 IPC read with Sections 13(2) and 13(1) of the PC Act. Accused 9 and 10 died even before the charge-sheet was sent to the Special Judge. The charge against the sole public servant under the PC Act could also not be framed since he died on 18-2-2005. The Special Judge also could not frame any charge against non-public servants. As already indicated, under sub-section (3) of Section 4, the Special Judge could try non-PC offences only when “trying any case” relating to PC offences. In the instant case, no PC offence has been committed by any of the non-public servants so as to fall under Section 3(1) of the PC Act. Consequently, there was no occasion for the Special Judge to try any case relating to the offences under the PC Act against the appellant. The trying of any case under the PC Act against a public 578 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports servant or a non-public servant, as already indicated, is a sine qua non for exercising powers under sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the PC Act. In the instant case, since no PC offence has been committed by any of the non-public servants and no charges have been framed against the public servant, while he was alive, the Special Judge had no occasion to try any case against any of them under the PC Act, since no charge has been framed prior to the death of the public servant. The jurisdictional fact, as already discussed above, does not exist so far as this appeal is concerned, so as to exercise jurisdiction by the Special Judge to deal with non-PC offences. 47. Consequently, we find no error in the view taken by the Special Judge, CBI, Greater Mumbai in forwarding the case papers of Special Case No. 88 of 2001 in the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for trying the case in accordance with law. Consequently, the passed by the High Court is set aside. The competent court to which Special Case No. 88 of 2001 is forwarded, is directed to dispose of the same within a period of six months. Criminal Appeal No. 161 of 2011 is allowed accordingly.” Citing this authority along with the judgement of this court in the cases of (i) Chiranjilal Goenka -vs- Jasjit Singh & Others [(1993) 2 SCC 507], (ii) State of Tamil Nadu -vs- Paramasiva Pandian [(2002) 1 SCC 15], (iii) State of Punjab -vs- Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar [(2011) 14 SCC 427] and (iv) Kaushik Chaterjee -vs- State of Haryana [(2020) 10 SCC 92] it was argued that the defect of jurisdiction strikes at the very power or authority of the Court and hence the Special Judge could not have passed the remand and hence the entire proceeding against the appellant before the Special Judge ought to fail.
