The main reliefs that may be claimed in the Election Petition have to be the reliefs as envisaged in Rule 6 of the said Rules of 1995. 14. Though a faint attempt was made by the learned counsel for the petitioner to argue that the agent of the petitioner had orally requested the Returning Offi cer to re-count the votes immediately after the announcement of total number of votes polled by each of the candidates, admittedly no such request was made in writing either by the petitioner or his agent to the Returning Offi cer as required under Rule 80 of the Nirvachan Niyam 1995. Even otherwise the petitioner was required to call in question, the election by fi ling an Election Petition under Section 122 of the said Act, in the manner prescribed under the Rules of 1995 which required the petitioner to seek declarations as envisaged in Rule 6 thereof, and in such a petition, she could have prayed for a relief of re-counting of votes. 15. There is hardly any need to reiterate the trite position of law that when it comes to the interpretation of statutory provisions relating to election law, jurisprudence on the subject mandates strict construction of the provisions4. Election contest is not an action at law or a suit in equity but purely a statutory proceeding, provision for which has to be strictly construed. The petitioner having failed to make any application in writing for re-counting of votes as required under Section 80 of the Nirvachan Niyam, 1995, and having failed to seek relief of declarations as required under Rule 6 of the Rules of 1995, the Election Petition fi led by the petitioner before the Sub Divisional Offi cer (R) seeking relief of re-counting of votes alone was not maintainable. 16. In that view of the matter, we do not fi nd any merit in the present appeal. 17. The appeal is dismissed. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal dismissed. Nidhi Jain
