Legality of the policy, and not the wisdom or soundness of the policy, is the subject of judicial review”. [Emphasis supplied] 50. This is particularly true for complex areas requiring empirical knowledge, data inputs, and technical expertise,48 such as matters involving economic policy,49 scientific policy,50 or international relations.51 Complex social, economic, or commercial issues require a trial and error approach, the weighing of different competing aspects, and often intricate factual studies.52 Such matters raise complicated multi-disciplinary questions that do not fall within the legal domain, are irreducible to one answer, and require adjustment of priorities amongst different stakeholders.53 51. Since courts are not equipped to evaluate such factual aspects, they cannot be allowed to formulate policy. In contrast, the legislature has the correct institutional mechanism to deliberate on various considerations, as it facilitates decision-making by democratically 47 Directorate of Film Festivals v. Gaurav Ashwin Jain (2007) 4 SCC 737, para 16. 48 Union of India v. S. L. Dutta (1991) 1 SCC 505, para 18. 49 State of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal (1986) 4 SCC 566, para 34. 50 Jacob Puliyel v. Union of India, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 533, paras 91 and 93. 51 Gaurav Kumar Bansal v. Union of India (2015) 2 SCC 130, para 9. 52 Shri Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Union of India (1990) 3 SCC 223, para 56. 53 Santosh Singh v. Union of India (2016) 8 SCC 253, paras 23 and 24. 1042 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports elected representatives who possess diverse tools and skill sets to balance social, economic, and political factors.54 Such policy matters thus ought to be entrusted to the legislature. This principle is succinctly encapsulated by Sanjeev Coke Mfg. Co. v. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd.,55 in which a 5-judge bench of this Court held that: "Scales of justice are just not designed to weigh competing social and economic factors. In such matters legislative wisdom must prevail and judicial review must abstain.” 52. Furthermore, the Courts are not tasked with assessing the efficacy of policies. A policy may successfully achieve the objectives outlined in legislation, or it may possess limitations hindering the full realization of its aims. Regardless, the Court cannot sit in over policy to determine whether revisions may be necessary for its enhancement. This has also been authoritatively elucidated by an 11-judge bench of this Court in the case of Rustom Cavasjee Cooper (Banks Nationalisation) v. Union of India:56 "63. This Court is not the forum in which these conflicting claims may be debated. […] The Parliament has under Entry 45, List I the power to legislate in respect of banking and other commercial activities of the named banks necessarily incidental thereto: it has the power to legislate for acquiring the undertaking of the named banks under Entry 42, List III. Whether by the exercise of the power vested in the Reserve Bank under the pre-existing laws, results could be achieved which it is the object of the Act to achieve, is, in our , not relevant in considering whether the Act amounts to abuse of legislative power.
