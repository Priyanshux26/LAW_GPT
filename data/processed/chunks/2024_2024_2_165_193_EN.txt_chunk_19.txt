41. Additionally, the application was rejected under Rule 17. No doubt this cannot be a rejection which will result in the cancellation of his caste certificate. This is also reinforced by the fact that the District Caste Certificate Scrutiny Committee, by its letter dated 14.09.2023, stated that the Appellant No.1’s application dated 30.12.2020 was “disposed for non-compliance” and clarifies that his Caste Certificate dated 03.02.2013 is not invalidated. The Appellant No.1 may take the benefit of the validity certificate issued to him on 12.07.2023, pursuant to his second application of 14.06.2023, for sustaining his Caste Certificate issued by the Competent Authority on 03.02.2013, for contesting in future elections and for claiming other concessions as may be available in law. 42. Appellant No.1 has ceased to be a member because of the automatic disqualification. In view of this, the proceedings of the Tahsildar dated 19.06.2023 rejecting the No Confidence Motion on the ground that the voting requirement of three-fourth of the members “entitled to sit and vote”, was not fulfilled, cannot be sustained and has rightly been set aside by the High Court. [2024] 2 S.C.R. 193 Sudhir Vilas Kalel & Ors. v. Bapu Rajaram Kalel & Ors. 43. The net result is that the High Court was right in setting aside the rejection of the No Confidence Motion and in holding that the No Confidence Motion against Appellant No. 2-Sarpanch, was duly carried. The High Court was also justified in directing that the Appellant No.2 should stop exercising the powers as a sarpanch and in further directing that the election for the post of village Sarpanch be notified afresh. The High Court was justified in quashing the declaration dated 19.06.2023 declaring that the No Confidence Motion had failed. 44. We affirm the judgement and of the High Court dated 20.09.2023 in Writ Petition No. 7924 of 2023. In view of the above discussion, the Appeal is dismissed. Interim s will stand vacated. No as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey Result of the case: Appeal dismissed.
