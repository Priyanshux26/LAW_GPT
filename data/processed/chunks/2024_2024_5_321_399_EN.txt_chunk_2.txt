with monthly compounding. [Paras 140-143] 324 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Interpretation of Statutes – Principle of harmonious construction – Interplay between the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 and the Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993: Held: Doctrine of harmonious construction is based on the principle that the legislature would not lightly take away from one hand what it had given with the other – Doctrine provides, that as far as possible, two seemingly conflicting provisions within a statute, or the seemingly conflicting provisions of one statute vis a vis another, should be construed in a manner so as to iron out any conflict – Beneficial provisions of the 1985 Act, was enacted to maximise the chances of revival of sick industrial companies, while the 1993 Act, was enacted with the intention to ensure that small-scale industries are paid their dues in time – This object of the 1993 Act was sought to be achieved by providing a high interest rate, with monthly compounding, so as to act as a deterrent for the buyers – Interest of justice requires that both the 1985 Act and the 1993 Act, which are in the nature of beneficial enactments, should be read harmoniously so as to impart a meaningful construction to the language of each of the enactments. [Paras 119, 125, 136] Interest – Grant of interest – Concept of : Held: When interest is awarded by the Court, normal feeling is that it is so awarded by way of penalty or punishment, however, interest in all cases is not granted by way of penalty or punishment – Interest on the delayed payment of the claim amount accrues due to the continuing wrong committed by the wilful withholding of the payment towards the claim, resulting in a continuous injury until such payment is made, or in other words, until the claim is realised.
