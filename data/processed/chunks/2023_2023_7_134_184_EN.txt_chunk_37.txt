It is needless to point-out that, before directing such investigation, the Superintendent of Police or an officer superior to him is required to apply his mind to the information and come to an opinion that the investigation on such allegations is C necessary. The argument canvassed on behalf of the accused persons is that there is no such of the police officer not below the rank of Superintendent of Police in the chargesheet. We do not propose to go into this issue in the present litigation. This issue was not even raised before the High Court. Even otherwise, this is a question of fact and a matter of record. If it is the case of the accused that there is no such D on record, the same may be pointed out to the trial court in the course of the trial. It is for the trial court to verify the record, look into it and take an appropriate call on this issue in accordance with law. 89. In view of the aforesaid discussion, all the appeals filed by the CBI succeed and are hereby allowed. E 90. The impugned s passed by the High Court are hereby set aside. 91. The Special Court shall now proceed further with the trial of the accused persons in accordance with law. F 92. Pending applications if any shall stand disposed of. Ankit Gyan Appeals allowed.
