The instant appeal is consequently dismissed. Nonetheless, we consider it essential to summarize our conclusions on the issues raised: i. The High Court rightly entertained the writ petition filed by Respondent No. 1, who had the requisite locus standi. The said writ petition filed in public interest was maintainable; ii. There were no delay or laches in approaching the High Court; iii. The contract awarded to NTBCL through the Concession Agreement by State authorities and NOIDA was unfair, unjust and inconsistent with Constitutional norms; iv. NOIDA exceeded its authority by delegating the power to levy fees or impose tolls to NTBCL, rendering such delegation invalid. v. Article 14 of the Concession Agreement, read with the formula in Annexure F, contravenes public policy and is, therefore, liable to be severed from the Agreement. 2042 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports vi. NTBCL has recovered the project costs and substantial profits, eliminating any justification for the continued imposition or collection of user fees or tolls. vii. The issue pertaining to outdoor licensing fees between NOIDA and NTBCL does not fall within the purview of the present challenge. 92. As regard to SLP(C) No. 8060/2019, concerning the challenge to the arbitration proceedings between NOIDA and NTBCL, it is clarified that the said matter shall be heard and decided separately on its own merit. 93. ed accordingly. Pending applications if any, to be disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Bibhuti Bhushan Bose
