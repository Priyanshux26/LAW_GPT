He further submits that, in view of provisions of Section 7 read with Section 10(3), the modified Standing would have taken effect only after the period of seven days from the date on which the copies of the of the Appellate Authority are sent to the employer and to the trade union or other prescribed representatives of the workmen under sub-Section (2) of Section 6 of the said Act.
