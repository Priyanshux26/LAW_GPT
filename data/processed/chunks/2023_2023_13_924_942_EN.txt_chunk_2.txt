(MD) No.15115 of 2020. 928 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. “7. The Superintending Engineer, in his letter dated 15.04.2017, has assumed that the petitioner had ‘”colour blindness”’ which, was not backed with any medical report. Likewise, the Chief Engineer (Personal), in the impugned of rejection has also termed the petitioner’s eye condition as “colour blindness”. On the contrary, the medical experts attached to the Ophthalmological Department of the two Hospitals referred above, were clearly of the view that there was only a ‘defective colour vision’ and not “colour blindness”. There is a huge diff erence between ‘”colour blindness”’ and ‘defective colour vision’. In the case of defective colour vision, the person with such defect could perform his normal routine life, if the defectiveness is minimal and probably, if the defectiveness was to be maximum, may be such candidate may have some inconvenience in his routine vision. 8. Admittedly, such norms have not been prescribed in the notifi cation dated 28.12.2015 calling for applications to the post of Assistant Engineer (Electrical), nor does the recruitment regulations of TANGEDCO prescribe these norms. While the medical experts have not certifi ed the fi tness of the petitioner’s colour vision, the respondents seem to have unilaterally come to a conclusion that the defectiveness in ‘colour vision’ opined by the medical expert, would be to such a percentage as to hamper the regular duties of an Assistant Engineer (Electrical). Such a decision is not based on intelligible diff erentia. No reliance has been placed on expert reports or any other material for the respondents to arrive at such a conclusion.
