22 under Section 11(6), for appointment of an arbitral tribunal, to adjudicate the disputes under the Shareholders Agreement pertaining to 2,00,010 shares and 4,00,000 shares respectively. II. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 17. Mr. Kunal Cheema, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, submitted that both the arbitration petitions arise out of disputes under the Shareholders Agreement. Clause 13.10 of the agreement provides for the arbitration clause and the same has not been disputed by the parties. 18. It was submitted that the petitioner was entitled to be allotted 4,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10 each in respondent no.1 company under the Shareholders Agreement. In addition, as per the letter dated 22.09.2011, respondent no.2 further confirmed that 2,00,010 equity shares in respondent no.1 which belonged to the petitioner, were being held by respondent no.2. Despite repeated reminders to both the respondents, the share certificates of the aforementioned shares were not issued to the petitioner. 19. The counsel submitted that the respondents have raised two broad contentions - one, with respect to the merits of the dispute; and two, that the claims made in the petitions are not maintainable as they are barred by limitation. As regards the first aspect, it was submitted 120 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports that the merits of the dispute can be looked into by the arbitral tribunal and arguments on merit can be made after the parties file their pleadings and lead evidence therein. 20. On the issue of limitation, it was submitted that under the Shareholders Agreement, there was no time frame within which the share certificates were to be issued to the petitioner. On a reading of the letter dated 22.09.2011, the value of the share was to be paid to the petitioner at the time of sale of respondent no.1 company. As far as the petitioner is aware, such a sale has not been made, at least till the issuance of notice dated 23.02.2017. Hence, there is no specific date/day on which it can be ascertained that the cause of action had arisen. 21. The counsel submitted that it is the case of the respondents that certain correspondence was exchanged between the parties in the period between 06.08.2015 and 15.10.2015. Therefore, the Arbitration Notice dated 23.01.2017 was sent within 3 years from 15.10.2015 which is the date of the last legal notice sent by the respondents to the petitioner. Thereafter, the petitioner filed two arbitration applications on 03.03.2017 before the High Court of Bombay which were ultimately dismissed on 22.02.2019. Immediately thereafter, on 09.04.2019, the present petitions were filed before this Court. Therefore, the arbitration petitions cannot be said to be ex-facie time barred and the implication or interpretation of the said correspondences could be looked into by the arbitral tribunal while deciding the claim and its maintainability on the question of limitation and merits. 22. It was submitted that, without prejudice to the aforesaid contention, even if it is assumed that the “cause of action” had arisen at any specific point of time, there is a continuing breach of contract since the respondents failed to provide the share certificates and abide by the Shareholders Agreement and the letter dated 22.09.2011.
