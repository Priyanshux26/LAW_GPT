Pursuant to the said , the Union of India has sought to place on record the decision-making process employed by the Government of India and the regulatory framework under which this permission was granted. 16.2 In addition to the above, the Union of India has stated in its Additional Affidavit dated 09.11.2022 that the research, development, and use of GE technologies is a highly technical matter guided by the views of subject experts. As such, the inquiry before this court is limited to whether there exists an adequate regulatory mechanism governing this field and whether material compliance with the same has been made. 16.3 The conditional approval for environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 and its parental lines Varuna bn 3.6 and EH-2 modbs 2.99 containing barnase, barstar, and bar genes prior to commercial release has been made after a long and exhaustive regulatory process which commenced as far back as in 2010 and is outlined as below: i. The initial R&D was conducted by the CGMCP in accordance with the Revised Guidelines for Research in Transgenic Plants, 1998 in the laboratory as well as greenhouse conditions. The R&D was regulated by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC) and RCGM as prescribed by the Guidelines. ii. Based on the information generated, an application was made to the IBSC for permission to conduct a confined field trial. After the recommendation of the IBSC, the CGMCP submitted a further application to RCGM. After the recommendation of the RCGM, GEAC considered the recommendation of the RCGM in its meetings dated 29.09.2010, 21.09.2011, and 18.07.2014. iii. After the completion of confined field tests, the CGMCP submitted an application dated 15.09.2015, along with a dossier of 3285 pages, seeking approval for environmental 2020 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports release of the GE mustard hybrid DMH-11 and its parental lines Varuna bn 3.6 and EH-2 modbs 2.99. iv. The said application was considered by GEAC in its 125th meeting dated 11.12.2015. After a detailed discussion, the applicant was invited to give a presentation to GEAC on 04.01.2016. Accordingly, on 04.01.2016, GEAC formed an eight-member sub-committee under the chairmanship of Dr. K. Veluthambi, Co-chair, GEAC. v. The meeting of the sub-committee took place on 02.02.2016 and the sub-committee recommended revision of the biosafety dossier by the applicant. Considering the above, GEAC, in its 127th meeting dated 05.02.2016, adopted the recommendations of the sub-committee and directed the revision of the dossier. In addition, GEAC directed preparation of the Biosafety RARM Report. vi. The sub-committee requested GEAC for an additional one month’s time to submit its final recommendations. The request was granted by GEAC in its 129th meeting dated 20.06.2016. GEAC also invited two groups of NGOs to present their views on the release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 in India. vii. Thereafter, on 11.08.2016, GEAC considered the report titled “Assessment of Food and Environmental Safety”, incorporating the evaluation of biosafety data generated by the applicant CGMCP and prepared by the sub-committee along with the inputs of RAU of the RCGM.
