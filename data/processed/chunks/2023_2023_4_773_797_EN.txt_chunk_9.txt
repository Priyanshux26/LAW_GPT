306/2007 H STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH v. M/S A.J. 785 INFRASTRUCTURES PVT. LTD [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] can recover the amount in pursuance of the consent decree A passed in their favour, the State has no preferential right to sell the property and, therefore, the petitioner bank is entitled to sell the mortgaged property and realize the arrears of amount due to them and State shall be entitled to recover the balance amount, if any, left with the bank or in the alternative, B they are at liberty to proceed against respondents No. 4 to 6 for recovery of the amount by proceeding against them in accordance with law. The Division Bench in the above case has already taken the view that the provisions of Section 35 of the Act would override the inconsistent provisions of Section 16B of the Tax Act and as such, there provisions of the Sales C Tax Act Section 16B as they are inconsistent with Section 35 of the Act are declared ultravires of the Constitution.” (emphasis ours) 16. Dissatisfied with the and dated 2nd January D 2008, the State and the Commissioner on 22nd May, 2008filed an application7 under section 151 of the CPC for “rectification etc., of the / dated 2nd January, 2008”. The prayer in such petition was for recall of the and dated 2nd January, 2008 in the interest of justice, equity and fair play so that theapplicants are saved from enormous adverse consequences of such and . E 17. The said application came to be considered by the same Division Bench (which had decided the writ petition) and stood dismissed, inter alia, by the following dated 5th June, 2008: “This application under Section 151 CPC has been purportedly (sic, filed) for rectification of our judgement dated F 2.1.2008. However, in the prayer clause it has been prayed that the judgement dated 2nd January, 2008 may be recalled. It is clear that under the garb of this application the State is seeking review of the judgement. We need not burden ourselves with the various grounds taken G in the application. The perusal of the application shows that it is virtually a review petition but has been styled to be an application under Section 151 CPC. This cannot be permitted. 7 CMP No. 1205 of 2008 H 786 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A Various facts have now been pleaded in this application, which were neither pleaded nor argued when the writ petition was heard and decided. In an application under Section 151 CPC, the applicants cannot be permitted to rake up absolutely new pleas which were never taken or argued in the writ petition. In case the State is aggrieved by the , it has the B remedy of approaching the apex Court. There is no error apparent on the face of the record of the judgement. The application being without any merit and being totally misconceived, is rejected”. 18. The and dated 2nd January, 2008 allowing the C writ petition has been challenged in Civil Appeal No.
