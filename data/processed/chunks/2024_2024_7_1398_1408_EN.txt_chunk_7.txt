Even the question of proving such document to the satisfaction of the Court to be lawful, also did not arise. Thus, it cannot be said that the dated 20.08.1984 was an under XXIII Rule 3 CPC. 21. Once it is held that the dated 20.08.1984 was not an of compromise of suit under XXIII Rule 3 CPC the argument relating to applicability and bar under XXIII Rule 3A CPC would have no relevance at all. 22. Additionally, we must also note the case of Som Dev v. Rati Ram 5 as presented by the appellants to clarify the rigors of XXIII Rule 3 of CPC. In this case, it was clarified by this Court that after the amendment of Code of Civil Procedure in 1977, a compromise decree can be passed only on compliance with the requirements of Rule 3 of XXIII, otherwise it may not be possible to recognize the same as compromise decree. When a compromise is to be recorded and a decree is to be passed, Rule 3 of XXIII of the Code requires that the terms of compromise should be reduced to writing and signed by the parties. 23. In the present case, neither the compromise deed has been reduced to writing, nor it is recorded by the court. Mere statements of the parties before court about such said compromise, cannot satisfy the requirements of XXIII Rule 3 of the CPC. Therefore, the compromise decree is not valid. 5 [2006] 5 Supp. SCR 778 : (2006) 10 SCC 788 1408 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 24.
