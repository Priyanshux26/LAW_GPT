It would go against the anti-discriminatory principles stipulated by this Court in so far as Judges drawn from various sources are concerned. Conclusion 31. We are, therefore, clearly of the view that the first respondent was entitled to the addition of the period during which she served as a Judge of the High Court to be added to the length of her service as a member of the district judiciary from 11 May 1981 to 31 July 2014. The break in her service must necessarily have no adverse implications in computing her pension for the simple reason that her service upon appointment as a High Court Judge was in pursuance of a recommendation which was made during her tenure as a Judge of the district judiciary. 32. The pensionary payments shall be computed on the basis of her last drawn salary as a Judge of the High Court. The arrears of pension shall be payable to the first respondent on or before 31 March 2024 together with interest at the rate of 6% per annum. 33. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. 34. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Result of the case: Mukund P Unny, Hony. Associate Editor Appeal disposed of. (Verified by: Liz Mathew, Sr. Adv.)
