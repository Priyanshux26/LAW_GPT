In such circumstances referred to above, the respondent amended his writ petition pending before the Gauhati High Court and challenged the fi nal of penalty dated 05.01.2016 in addition to the original reliefs prayed before the CAT, Guwahati. B. IMPUGNED PASSED BY THE HIGH COURT 25. The impugned of the High Court is in three parts. In other words, the High Court allowed the writ petition and set aside the of penalty on three grounds: - (i) First, the High Court took the view that the Central Complaints Committee was constituted by the competent authority to inquire into only the fi rst complaint dated 30.08.2011, however, the Central Complaints Committee during the course of its inquiry also looked into the allegations levelled in the second Complaint dated 502 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 18.09.2012 which it could not have. The relevant observations on this issue read as under: - “41. What is important to note is that a complaint dated 18.09.2012 along with fi ve Annexures was submitted by Smt. X to the Chairperson of the CCC and copy of such complaint was also made available to the petitioner. In the inquiry report the above fact is not mentioned. It also does not appear that the said complaint was brought to the notice of the disciplinary authority. The CCC was mandated by the authority to inquire into the complaint dated 30.08.2011. However, it is manifest from the inquiry report that the complaint submitted on 18.09.2012 was also taken into consideration. It is noted by the CCC in the report under the heading “VI. Charges which were admitted/dropped/ not pressed” that the petitioner did not plead guilty to any of the allegations made by the complainant in her complaint dated 30.08.2011. Though the copy of the complaint dated 30.08.2011 was furnished, the same was not given in the form of articles of charge. The requirement of the offi cer proceeded against to be formally asked whether he pleads guilty or not would, according to the understanding of the court, is not an opportunity to such offi cer only to answer the same in a mono-syllable. To give meaning to the word “formally”, a real and eff ective opportunity has to be granted to the offi cer concerned to make his comment in writing in response to the complaint. Apparently, no such opportunity was aff orded. There is no indication that in respect of the complaint dated 18.09.2012, the offi cer was even asked as to whether he pleads guilty to the allegations made therein or not.
