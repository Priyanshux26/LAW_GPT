It was contended that in the absence of there being any connection between the offences alleged against the petitioner herein with the offences alleged against the accused by the Gujarat Police, the invocation of Section 8 of the NIA Act for passing of the impugned s is illegal and arbitrary and in total violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. Learned senior counsel submitted that the writ petitions may be allowed and the s issued at Annexures P-4, P-6 and P-9 insofar as the petitioner is concerned, may be quashed and set-aside. 4.4 Learned senior counsel, Sri Dave, further submitted that the High Court which has granted bail to the petitioner herein vide dated 05.07.2021 could not have, at the instance of NIA, cancelled the bail by the impugned dated 29.01.2024. He submitted that if the arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioner in the writ petition are accepted by this Court and the s at Annexures P-4, P-6 and P-9 assailed in the writ petition are quashed, then the impugned of cancellation of bail by the High Court at the instance of the respondent NIA would have to be quashed. Consequently, the earlier of the High Court granting bail would revive. The petitioner is willing to cooperate with the trial of the offences alleged against him under the NDPS Act before the Special Court in Punjab itself. Consequently, it is submitted that the transfer of the FIR and trial to Special Court, Ahmedabad would also have to be 1760 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports quashed. Learned senior counsel submitted that the arguments advanced in the writ petition be read as part and parcel of the arguments in the Special Leave Petition and the impugned of cancellation of the petitioner’s bail may be set-aside and the earlier dated 05.07.2021 granting bail may be revived. 4.5 On the other hand, learned ASG Ms. Aishwarya Bhati appearing for respondent Union of India and NIA, with reference to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of Union of India at the outset submitted that the writ petition is misconceived; that the impugned dated 29.6.2020 (Annexure P-4) was issued by the Central Government by invoking sub-section (5) of Section 6 of the NIA Act; the petitioner herein cannot have any grievance with regard to the said inasmuch as the petitioner is not named in FIR No.1/2018 dated 12.08.2018; however, during the investigation of the Scheduled Offences under Sections 17 and 18 of the UAPA Act which are also connected with FIR No.01/2018 dated 12.08.2018 at PS ATS, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, under certain provisions of the NDPS Act (non-scheduled offences), it emerged that the offences alleged against the petitioner herein in FIR No.23/2020 and FIR No.20/2020 were connected to the Scheduled Offences under Sections 17 and 18 of the UAPA which were already being investigated by the NIA and, therefore, s at Annexures P-6 and P-9 were issued. 4.6 With reference to the role of the petitioner, it was submitted by Ms. Bhati that he is part of the narco-terror network of smuggling drugs into India, transporting from Gujarat to Punjab, storing the same and purifying in Amritsar and Ludhiana for further distribution to various parts of Punjab and the National Capital, New Delhi and its surrounding areas.
