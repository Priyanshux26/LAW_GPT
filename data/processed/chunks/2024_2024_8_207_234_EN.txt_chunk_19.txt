The power to nominate is therefore not a vestige of the past or a power of the Administrator that is continued by default. It is made to incorporate change in the Constitutional structure of NCTD. (x) The ‘text’ of Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the DMC Act, 1957 as amended by Act 67/1993 expressly enables the ‘Lt. Governor’ to nominate persons having special knowledge to the Corporation. The power expressed by the statute in the name of Lt. Governor, also seen in the ‘context’ of other provisions of the statute, demonstrates the statutory scheme in which powers and duties are distributed among authorities under 234 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the Act. The context in which the power is located confirms that the Lt. Governor is intended to act as per the mandate of the statute and not to be guided by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. 39. Having examined the provisions of the Act, we are of the opinion that Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act is a Parliamentary enactment vesting the power of nomination of persons with special knowledge in municipal administration with the Lt. Governor. The power is to be exercised as a statutory duty of the Lt. Governor and not as the executive power of the Government of NCTD. 40. For the reasons stated above, the notifications dated 03.01.2023 and 04.01.2023 issued by the Lt. Governor under Section 3(3)(b)(i) are not in violation of Article 239AA read with Section 41 of the GNCTD Act. 41. Accordingly, this Writ Petition (C) No. 348 of 2023 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India is dismissed. 42. No as to costs. Result of the case: Writ Petition dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
