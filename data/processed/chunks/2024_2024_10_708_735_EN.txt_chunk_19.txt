Upon considering the evidence on the part of the appellants herein (the defendants), we have no hesitation to hold that the requirements to co-exist to constitute adverse possession are not established by them. So also, it can only be held that the reckoning of the period of limitation from the date of commencement of the right of ownership of the plaintiff over the suit land instead of looking into whether they had succeeded in pleading and establishing the date of commencement of adverse possession and satisfaction regarding the prescriptive period in that regard, was rightly interfered with, by the High Court. 46. There can be no doubt that being concurrent cannot be a ground for confirmation and as held by this Court in D.R. Rathna Murthy v. Ramappa,17 concurrent findings could be set aside if perversity is found with the impugned decision. 17 [2010] 12 SCR 755 : (2011) 1 SCC 158 734 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 47. The upshot of the discussion as above is that the well-merited decision of the High Court in the impugned invite no interference in exercise of appellate jurisdiction and the appeals are liable to be dismissed. Hence, the captioned appeals are dismissed. No as to costs. Contempt Petition (C) Nos. 517-518 of 2020 IN Civil Appeal Nos. 3159-3160 of 2019 48. The Contempt Petition arises out of an passed on 27.03.2015 in Civil Appeal Nos. 3159-3160 of 2019 when it was remaining only as SLP Nos. 6995-6996 of 2015. This court, while issuing notice ed thus: - “Status quo regarding possession, as it exists today, shall be maintained by the parties, till further s.” On 27.10.2020 this court passed another , wherein, inter-alia, it was ed: “It is made clear that on the next occasion, the contempt petition as well as CA Nos. 3159-3160/2019 shall be disposed of finally.” 49. The alleged contempt is that pending the Civil Appeal and after the passing of the of status quo regarding possession, the respondents in the contempt petition viz., the appellants created third party rights in the property. Obviously, with the dismissal of the civil appeals the impugned and decree of the High Court got confirmed and the declaration that the first respondent in the appeal – plaintiff is entitled to recovery of possession of the suit property mentioned specifically therein has become final. Therefore, indisputably, in terms of the and decree the appellants herein are bound to deliver vacant and possession of the scheduled suit land to the plaintiff viz., the first respondent. 50. Since the same is executable we do not propose to go into the contentions in the contempt petition and are inclined only to close the contempt petition in view of the in Civil Appeal Nos. 3159-3160 of 2019 and to discharge the notice issued to alleged [2024] 10 S.C.R. 735 Neelam Gupta & Ors. v. Rajendra Kumar Gupta & Anr. contemnors and to leave the first respondent in the Civil Appeals viz., the plaintiff to execute the decree, in accordance with law.
