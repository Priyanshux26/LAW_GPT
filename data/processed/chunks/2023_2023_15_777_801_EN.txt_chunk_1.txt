[Paras 34, 35, 41] STATE OF PUNJAB v. PRINCIPAL SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNOR 779 OF PUNJAB AND ANOTHER Constitution of India – Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha (Punjab Legislative Assembly) – The dispute in the present case essentially bears upon the Governor having detained four Bills which were passed by the Vidhan Sabha on 20.06.2023: Held: There is no valid constitutional basis to cast doubt on the validity of the session of the Vidhan Sabha which was held on 19.06.2023, 20.06.2023 and 20.10.2023 – Any attempt to cast doubt on the session of the legislature would be replete with grave perils to democracy – The Speaker who has been recognized to be a guardian of the privileges of the House and the constitutionally recognized authority who represents the House, was acting well within his jurisdiction in adjourning the House sine die – The re-convening of the House was within the ambit of Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure – Casting doubt on the validity of the session of the House is not a constitutional option open to the Governor – The Legislative Assembly comprises of duly elected Members of the Legislature – During the tenure of the Assembly, the House is governed by the decisions which are taken by the Speaker in matters of adjournment and prorogation – Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that the Governor of Punjab must now proceed to take a decision on the Bills which have been submitted for assent on the basis that the sitting of the House which was conducted on 19.06.2023, 20.06.2023 and 20.10.2023 was constitutionally valid.
