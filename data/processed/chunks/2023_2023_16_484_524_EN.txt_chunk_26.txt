THROUGH ITS MANAGING DIRECTOR [UJJAL BHUYAN, J.] had purchased twenty fi ve MV turbines on and around 08.07.1998 for the purpose of its eligible business. Assessee claimed depreciation on the said turbines at the rate of 25% on WDV basis. On perusal of the materials on record, assessing offi cer held that in view of the change in the law with regard to allowance of depreciation on the assets of the power generating unit w.e.f. 01.04.1997, the assessee would be entitled to depreciation on straight line method in respect of assets acquired on or after 01.04.1997 as per the specifi ed percentage in terms of Rule 5 (1A) of the Income Tax Rules, 1962. Assessing offi cer however noted that the assessee did not exercise the option of claiming depreciation on WDV basis. Therefore, it would be entitled to depreciation on straight line method. 36.1. After obtaining the clarifi cation of the assessee, assessing offi cer held that since the assessee did not exercise the option of adopting WDV method, therefore, in view of the provision of Rule 5 (1A) of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 (briefl y ‘the Rules’ hereinafter), it would be entitled to depreciation on the straight line method. On that basis, as against the depreciation claim of the assessee of Rs. 2,85,37,634.00, the assessing offi cer allowed depreciation to the extent of Rs. 1,59,10,047.00. 37. In the appeal before the CIT (A), the assessee contended that the assessing offi cer had erred in limiting the allowance of depreciation on the turbines to Rs. 1,59,10,047.00 as against the claim of Rs. 2,85,37,634.00. However, vide the appellate dated 16.05.2005, CIT (A) confi rmed the disallowance of depreciation made by the assessing offi cer. 38. On further appeal by the assessee before the Tribunal, vide the dated 07.06.2007, the Tribunal on the basis of its previous decision in the case of the assessee itself for the assessment year 2000-2001 answered this question in favour of the assessee. 39. When the matter came up before the High Court in appeal by the revenue under Section 260A of the Act, the High Court referred to the proviso to sub-rule (1A) of Rule 5 of the Rules and affi rmed the view taken by the Tribunal. The High Court held that there was no perversity in the reasoning of the Tribunal and therefore, the question raised by the revenue could not be said to be a substantial question of law. 518 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 40. Rule 5 provides for the method of calculation of depreciation allowed under Section 32 (1) of the Act. It says that such depreciation of any block of assets shall be allowed, subject to provisions of sub-rule (2), as per the specifi ed percentage mentioned in the second column of the table in Appendix-I to the Rules on the WDV of such block of assets as are used for the purposes of the business or profession of the assessee during the relevant previous year. In so far the present case is concerned, it is not in dispute that sub-rule (2) has no application.
