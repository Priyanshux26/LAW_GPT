[Paras 17, 29, 30-32, 35, 36] Service Law – Service jurisprudence – Punishments – Compulsory retirement: Held: Ordinarily a person in service cannot be visited with a punishment not specified in the contract of service or the law governing such service – Punishments may be specified either in the contract of service or in the Act or the rules governing such service – Compulsory retirement is a well-accepted method of removing dead wood from the cadre without affecting his entitlement for retirement benefits, if otherwise payable – It is another form of terminating the service without affecting retirement benefits – [2024] 6 S.C.R. 431 Union of India & Ors. v. Santosh Kumar Tiwari Ordinarily, compulsory retirement is not considered a punishment – But if the service rules permit it to be imposed by way of a punishment, subject to an enquiry, so be it. [Paras 18, 33] Interpretation of Statutes – Central Reserve Police Force Act, 1949 – ss.11, 9, 10 – “subject to”: Held: As regards Section 11 being exhaustive of the minor punishments which could be imposed, the intention of the legislature appears to the contrary – Section 11 expressly uses the phrase “subject to any rules made under this Act” before “award in lieu of, or in addition to, suspension or dismissal any one or more of the following punishments” – While prescribing punishment for “more heinous offences” and “less heinous offences” in Sections 9 and 10 respectively, the phrase “subject to any rules made under this Act” is not used – The expression “subject to” conveys the idea of a provision yielding place to another provision or other provisions subject to which it is made. [Para 28] Administrative Law – Delegate’s power to make rules: Held: The intention of the legislature, as indicated in the enabling Act, must be the prime guide to the extent of delegate’s power to make rules – However, the delegate must not travel wider than the object of the legislature rather it must remain true to it.
