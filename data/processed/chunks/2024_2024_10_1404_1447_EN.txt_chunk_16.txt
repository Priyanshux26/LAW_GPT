The Competition Commission of India rejected the application for extension of time by SAIL. It held that a prima facie case was made out against SAIL 41 [1976] 1 SCR 306 : (1975) 2 SCC 702 [25] 42 [1976] 1 SCR 306 : (1975) 2 SCC 702 [28] 43 [1976] 1 SCR 306 : (1975) 2 SCC 702 [29] 44 [1976] 1 SCR 306 : (1975) 2 SCC 702 [40] 45 [2010] 11 SCR 112 : (2010) 10 SCC 744 1426 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and directed the Director General to make an investigation. SAIL challenged the above before the Competition Appellate Tribunal. The Commission filed an application for impleadment before the Competition Appellate Tribunal on the ground that it was a necessary and proper party. Emphasis was placed on Section 18 of the Competition Act to contend that the powers, functions and duties of the Commission required it to be impleaded as a party in the appeals filed before the Tribunal. The Tribunal dismissed the application for impleadment. An appeal was preferred against this . This issue framed by this Court was : “whether the Commission would be a necessary or at least a proper party in the proceedings before the Tribunal in an appeal preferred by a party”.46 A three-Judge Bench of this Court held that the Commission was a necessary party in cases where it initiated a suo moto inquiry and that it was a proper party in all other proceedings before the Competition Tribunal: “31(3). The Commission, in cases where the inquiry has been initiated by the Commission suo moto, shall be a necessary party and in all other cases the Commission shall be a proper party in the proceedings before the Competition Tribunal. The presence of the Commission before the Tribunal would help in complete adjudication and effective and expeditious disposal of matters. Bring an expert body, its views would be of appropriate assistance to the Tribunal. Thus, the Commission in the proceedings before the Tribunal would be a necessary or a proper party, as the case may be.” 30. While arriving at this conclusion, this Court relied on the following aspects: a. Section 53-S(3) of the Competition Act provides that the Commission may authorise one or more Chartered Accountants, Company Secretaries, Cost Accountants or legal practitioners to present the case of the Commission with respect to any appeal before the Appellate Tribunal.47 The Commission’s legal right to 46 [2010] 11 SCR 112 : (2010) 10 SCC 744 [30.3] 47 The Competition Act 2002; Section 53S; Also see the Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations 2009; Regulation 51 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1427 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. representation before the Appellate tribunal would be diluted if the Commission was absent;48 b. The Competition Commission can initiate suo moto proceedings in terms of Section 19 read with Section 26 of the Competition Act. Principles of fairness require that such a party be heard by the Tribunal before any s “adverse to it are passed”.
