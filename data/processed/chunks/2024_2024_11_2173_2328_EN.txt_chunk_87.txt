Supreme Court Reports delaying arbitration until these challenges are resolved. This tactic can effectively halt the arbitration process, leading to avoidable delays in resolution- a problem exacerbated by the broader issue of judicial backlog in India. 16. Section 11(6A) was inserted in the Arbitration Act through the 2015 Amendment: “11(6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6), shall, notwithstanding any , decree or of any Court, confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.” [emphasis supplied] 17. The language in Section 11(6A) read with Section 5 of the Arbitration Act, and an interpretation focusing on the legislative intent informs us about the narrow scope for court’s scrutiny under Section 11(6A), at the stage of appointment of arbitrators,. 18. In Mayavati Trading (P) Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman,4 a three-Judge Bench of this Court affirmed the reasoning in Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.5 by observing that the examination under Section 11(6A) is “confined to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement and is to be understood in the narrow sense.” It was also held that the position of law prior to the 2015 Amendment Act, as set forth by the decisions of this Court in SBP & Co. v Patel Engineering6 and National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd,7 which widened the scope of judicial intervention, are legislatively overruled. 19. In the concurring opinion in A.Ayyasamy vs A. Paramasivam,8 it was observed as under: “53. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, should in my view be interpreted so as to bring in line the principles 4 (2019) 8 SCC 714 5 (2017) 9 SCC 729 6 (2005) 8 SCC 618 7 (2009) 1 SCC 267 8 (2016) 10 SCC 386 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2285 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company underlying its interpretation in a manner that is consistent with prevailing approaches in the common law world. Jurisprudence in India must evolve towards strengthening the institutional efficacy of arbitration. Deference to a forum chosen by parties as a complete remedy for resolving all their claims is but part of that evolution. Minimising the intervention of courts is again a recognition of the same principle.” [emphasis supplied] 20. In the significant decision on the Interplay Between Arbitration Agreements under A&C Act, 1996 & Stamp Act, 1899,9 7 judges of this Court had emphasized on the minimal supervisory roles of Court in arbitral process: “81. One of the main objectives behind the enactment of the Arbitration Act was to minimize the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process by confining it only to the circumstances stipulated by the legislature. For instance, Section 16 of the Arbitration Act provides that the arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction “including ruling on any objection with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.” The effect of Section 16, bearing in view the principle of minimum judicial interference, is that judicial authorities cannot intervene in matters dealing with the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.
