Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd., 1985 Supp SCC 280 : 1985 SCC (Tax) 538] We are of the opinion that in view of the clear provisions of Section 7(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 and Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, these directions were legally wrong.” 103. In MCD v. Gurnam Kaur,54 A 3-Judge bench of this Court held that: “11. ... A decision should be treated as given per incuriam when it is given in ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a rule having the force of a statute.” 104. In Punjab Land Development & Reclamation Corpn. Ltd. v. Labour Court,55 a five-judge bench of this Court said the following in the context of the principle of per incuriam for ignoring statutory provisions :- “43. As regards the s of the Supreme Court allegedly rendered in ignorance of a relevant constitutional provision or other statutory provisions on the subjects covered by them, it is true that the Supreme Court may not be said to “declare the law” on those subjects if the relevant provisions were not really present to its mind. But in this case Sections 25-G and 25-H were not directly 54 [1988] Supp. 2 SCR 929 : (1989) 1 SCC 101 55 [1990] 3 SCR 111 : (1990) 3 SCC 682 628 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports attracted and even if they could be said to have been attracted in laying down the major premise, they were to be interpreted consistently with the subject or context. The problem of per incuriam when actually arises, should present no difficulty as this Court can lay down the law afresh, if two or more of its earlier s cannot stand together.” [emphasis supplied] 105. In N.Bhargavan Pillai v. State of Kerala,56 a two-judge bench speaking through Arijit Pasayat J. noted that a cannot be treated as a binding precedent, if it fails to notice a specific statutory bar: “14. Coming to the plea relating to benefits under the Probation Act, it is to be noted that Section 18 of the said Act clearly rules out application of the Probation Act to a case covered under Section 5(2) of the Act. Therefore, there is no substance in the accused-appellant’s plea relating to grant of benefit under the Probation Act. The decision in Bore Gowda case [(2000) 10 SCC 260 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 1244] does not even indicate that Section 18 of the Probation Act was taken note of. In view of the specific statutory bar the view, if any, expressed without analysing the statutory provision cannot in our view be treated as a binding precedent and at the most is to be considered as having been rendered per incuriam. Looked at from any angle, the appeal is sans merit and deserves dismissal which we direct.” 106.
