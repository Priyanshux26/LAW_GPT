Raju, A.S.G., Mukesh Kumar Maroria, Zoheb Hussain, Annam Venkatesh, Ms. Sairica Raju, Advs. for the Respondents. / OF THE SUPREME COURT SANJAY KUMAR, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. Challenge in these appeals is to the s dated 20.07.2023 and 26.07.2023 passed by a Division Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court dismissing CWP No. 14536 of 2023 fi led by Pankaj Bansal and CWP No. 14539 of 2023 fi led by his father, Basant Bansal. By the dated 20.07.2023, the Division Bench opined that, as the constitutional validity of Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (for brevity, ‘the Act of 2002’), had been upheld by the Supreme Court, the challenge to the same by the writ petitioners could not be considered only because of the fact that a review petition was pending before the Supreme Court. The prayer of the writ petitioners to that eff ect was accordingly rejected. By the later dated 26.07.2023, the Division Bench rejected the prayer of the writ petitioners to quash/set aside their arrest s along with their arrest memos and the consequential proceedings arising therefrom, including the s dated 15.06.2023, 20.06.2023 and 26.06.2023 passed by the learned Vacation Judge/ Additional Sessions Judge, Panchkula, whereby they were remanded to the custody of the Directorate of Enforcement (for brevity, ‘the ED’) and thereafter, to judicial custody. The Division Bench further held that, keeping in view the gravity of the allegations against them, their prayer to be released from custody did not deserve acceptance and rejected PANKAJ BANSAL v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 719 [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] the same. In consequence, the Division Bench dismissed both the writ petitions. Hence, these appeals by Pankaj Bansal and Basant Bansal. 3. The genesis of these appeals is traceable to FIR No. 0006 dated 17.04.2023 registered by the Anti-Corruption Bureau, Panchkula, Haryana, under Sections 7, 8, 11 and 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, read with Section 120B IPC for the off ences of corruption and bribery along with criminal conspiracy. The names of the accused in this FIR are: ‘i). Mr. Sudhir Parmar (the then Special Judge, CBI and ED, Panchkula); ii). Mr. Ajay Parmar (nephew of Mr. Sudhir Parmar and Deputy Manager (Legal) in M3M Group); iii). Mr. Roop Bansal (Promotor of M3M Group); and iv). other unknown persons.’ 4. Signifi cantly, prior to this FIR, between the years 2018 and 2020, 13 FIRs were gotten registered by allottees of two residential projects of the IREO Group, alleging illegalities on the part of its management. On the strength of these FIRs, the ED recorded Enforcement Case Information Report No. GNZO/10/2021 dated 15.06.2021 (hereinafter, ‘the fi rst ECIR’) in connection with the money laundering off ences allegedly committed by the IREO Group and Lalit Goyal, its Vice-Chairman and Managing Director. Neither in the FIRs nor in the fi rst ECIR were M3M Group or the appellants herein arrayed as the accused. Further, no allegations were levelled against them therein.
