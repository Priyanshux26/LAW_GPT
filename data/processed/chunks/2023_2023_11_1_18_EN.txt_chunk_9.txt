v. 15 SHARWAN KUMAR KUMAWAT ETC. ETC [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] 20. Kerala State Beverages (M AND M) Corporation Limited v. P.P. Suresh, (2019) 9 SCC 710 : - “B. Legitimate expectation 14. The main argument on behalf of the respondents was that the Government was bound by its promise and could not have resiled from it. They had an indefeasible legitimate expectation of continued employment, stemming from the Government dated 20-2-2002 which could not have been withdrawn. It was further submitted on behalf of the respondents that they were not given an opportunity before the benefi t that was promised, was taken away. To appreciate this contention of the respondents, it is necessary to understand the concept of legitimate expectation. 15. The principle of legitimate expectation has been recognised by this Court in Union of India v. Hindustan Development Corpn. [(1993) 3 SCC 499] If the promise made by an authority is clear, unequivocal and unambiguous, a person can claim that the authority in all fairness should not act contrary to the promise. 16. M. Jagannadha Rao, J. elaborately elucidated on legitimate expectation in Punjab Communications Ltd. v. Union of India [(1999) 4 SCC 727] . He referred (at SCC pp. 741-42, para 27) to the in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service [1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 WLR 1174 : (1984) 3 All ER 935 (HL)] in which Lord Diplock had observed that for a legitimate expectation to arise, the decisions of the administrative authority must aff ect the person by depriving him of some benefi t or advantage which, “27. … (i) he had in the past been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there have been communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the decision-maker that they will not be withdrawn without giving him fi rst an opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn.” (AC p. 408)” 16 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 17. Rao, J. observed in this case, that the procedural part of legitimate expectation relates to a representation that a hearing or other appropriate procedure will be aff orded before the decision is made. The substantive part of the principle is that if a representation is made that a benefi t of a substantive nature will be granted or if the person is already in receipt of the benefi t, that it will be continued and not be substantially varied, then the same could be enforced. 18.It has been held by R.V. Raveendran, J. in Ram Pravesh Singh v. State of Bihar [(2006) 8 SCC 381 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 1986] that legitimate expectation is not a legal right. Not being a right, it is not enforceable as such. It may entitle an expectant: (SCC p. 391, para 15) “(a) to an opportunity to show cause before the expectation is dashed; or (b) to an explanation as to the cause for denial.
