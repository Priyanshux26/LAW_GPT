[Para 33][527-C-D] G 1.8 In the facts of the instant case, the alleged offence was committed on 21.3.1995, and the of the trial court was delivered on 7.12.1999. More than 28 years have passed since the commission of the offence. The relevant trial court record has not been able to be reconstructed, despite the efforts of the H JITENDRA KUMAR RODE v. UNION OF INDIA 515 courts below. Hence, ing a retrial is not in the interest of A justice and would not serve any fruitful purpose. The time elapsed must be taken into consideration by the Court, and it is stressed on that, only after taking due note of and taking steps to abide by the warning issued by this Court. [Para 34][527-E-G] State of U.P. v. Abhai Raj Singh and Another (2004) 4 B SCC 6 : [2004] 2 SCR 818 – referred to. Sita Ram & Others v. State 1981 Cr.LJ, 65 – referred to. 1.9 Protection of the rights under Article 21 entails protection of liberty from any restriction thereupon in the absence C of fair legal procedure. Fair legal procedure includes the opportunity for the person filing an appeal to question the conclusions drawn by the trial court. The same can only be done when the record is available with the Court of Appeal. That is the mandate of Section 385 CrPC. Therefore, it is not within prudence to lay down a straightjacket formula, the non-compliance with D the mandate of the section, in certain cases contingent upon specific facts and circumstances of the case, would result in a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which is found in the instant case. [Para 35][527-G-H; 528-A-B] 1.10 The language of Section 385 shows that the Court E sitting in appeal governed thereby is required to call for the records of the case from the concerned Court below. The same is an obligation, power coupled with a duty, and only after the perusal of such records would an appeal be decided. [Para 36][528-C] F 1.11 The impugned and the conviction passed by Special Judge is set aside. [Para 37][528-D] 1.12.
