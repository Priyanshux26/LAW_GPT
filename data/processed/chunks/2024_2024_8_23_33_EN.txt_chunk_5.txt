Digital Supreme Court Reports lessee that there was a delay on the part of the school in challenging the of conversion. The submissions recorded in the impugned show that the parties proceeded on the footing that there was a challenge to the conversion . The counter filed by the alleged lessee before the High Court shows that it refers to the amended Writ Petition and paragraph 45 of the counter raises a contention of the delay in challenging the conversion deed. Therefore, the argument that the amendment was not allowed need not detain us. ON MERITS 11. Coming back to the facts of the case, the plot was put to auction in 1995. The Special Nazul Officer accepted the highest bid offered by the school of Rs. 8,51,043.15, out of which a sum of Rs. 85,105 was paid along with the tender. We have already stated the facts leading to the cancellation of the highest bid of the school and acceptance of the second-highest bid of the sons of the alleged lessee. It is important to note that the Special Nazul officer passed an on 26th November 2001, by which the consideration for converting leasehold rights into freehold rights was fixed at Rs.67,022.21. This amount was less than 10% of the bid offered by the school about 16 years before the dated 26th November 2001. On the face of it, this cannot be a fair and transparent process of transferring the State’s ownership rights. 12. We have perused the of the Civil Court dated 24th July 2000 which dismissed the suit filed by the alleged lessee. The Trial Court held that the alleged lessee was not entitled to the benefits of G.Os. dated 17th February 1996 and 1st December 1998. In the suit, the alleged lessee sought conversion from leasehold to freehold based on these two G.Os. All findings were recorded against the alleged lessee except the finding that he was in possession of the plot. Being aggrieved by the decree of dismissal of the suit, the alleged lessee preferred First Appeal No.81 of 2000. The appeal was disposed of by the dated 6th December 2000. The said makes an interesting reading. The High Court heard the counsel for the alleged lessee, the authority, and the State Government. The first paragraph refers to the appearances of the learned counsel. The second paragraph gives the facts in brief. The same paragraph also notes that the alleged lessee sought the relief of mandatory injunction for the grant of conversion in terms of the G.Os. dated [2024] 8 S.C.R. 31 City Montessori School v. State of U.P. & Ors. 17th February 1996 and 1st December 1998 and that the Trial Court declined to grant the said relief.
