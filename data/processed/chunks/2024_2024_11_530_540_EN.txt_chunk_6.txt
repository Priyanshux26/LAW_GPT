20. Before we conclude, we must clarify that the limited jurisdiction of the referral Courts under Section 11 must not be misused by parties in to force other parties to the arbitration agreement to participate in a time-consuming and costly arbitration process. This is possible in instances, including but not limited to, where the claimant canvasses the adjudication of non-existent and mala fide claims through arbitration. With a view to balance the limited scope of judicial interference of the referral Courts with the interests of the parties who might be constrained to participate in the arbitration proceedings, the Arbitral Tribunal may direct that the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the party which the Tribunal ultimately finds to have abused the process of law and caused unnecessary harassment to the other party to the arbitration. Having said that, it is clarified that the aforesaid is not to be construed as a determination of the merits of the matter before us, which the Arbitral Tribunal will rightfully be equipped to determine. E. CONCLUSION 21. The existence of the arbitration agreement in Clause 18.12 of the MSA has not been disputed by the respondent. The question whether there exists a valid dispute to be referred to arbitration can be addressed by the Arbitral Tribunal as a preliminary issue. 22. As a result, the appeal filed by the appellant is allowed and the impugned passed by the High Court of Bombay is hereby set aside. 23. We appoint Mr. S.J. Vazifdar, former Chief Justice of the Punjab & Haryana High Court, as the sole arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes between the parties. 540 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 24.
