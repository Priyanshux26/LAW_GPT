M/s Express Publications (Madurai) Ltd. shall continue to apply. In the light of the rules of the company and the terms of the employment s, the management relieved the employee from duty by paying one month salary in lieu of notice on 08.10.2003, which was accepted and also encashed by the employee. Hence, there is no procedural violation of law on the part of the management in terminating the services of the employee. Thus, according to the learned counsel, the of the High Court setting aside the award of the Labour Court to the extent of reinstating the employee with compensation in lieu of back wages, requires no interference by this Court. 9.
