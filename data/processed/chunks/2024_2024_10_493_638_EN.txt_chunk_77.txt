165. However, as evident from the language of Article 15(1), caste cannot be a ground to discriminate against members of marginalized castes. 243 Murthy Match Works v. Asst Collector of Central Excise (1974) 4 SCC 428 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 607 Sukanya Shantha v. Union of India & Ors. Any use of caste as a basis for classification must withstand judicial scrutiny to ensure it does not perpetuate discrimination against the oppressed castes. While caste-based classifications are permissible under certain constitutional provisions, they are strictly regulated to ensure they serve the purpose of promoting equality and social justice. 166. In the context of prisons, valid classification must be a functional classification.244 The classification of prisoners has been considered both from the point of view of security and discipline as well as reform and rehabilitation.245 This has been the objective. However, there is no nexus between classifying prisoners based on caste and securing the objectives of security or reform. Limitations on inmates that are cruel, or irrelevant to rehabilitation are per se unreasonable, arbitrary and constitutionally suspect.246 Inmates are entitled to fair treatment that promotes rehabilitation, and classification of any kind must be geared towards the same. Courts have been enjoined with the duty “to invigorate the intra-mural man-management so that the citizen inside has spacious opportunity to unfold his potential without overmuch inhibition or sadistic overseeing”.247 Segregating prisoners on the basis of caste would reinforce caste differences or animosity that ought to be prevented at the first place. Segregation would not lead to rehabilitation. 167. The petitioner’s counsel have brought to the notice the observations made by the Madras High Court in C. Arul v. The Secretary to Government.248 One of the prayers in the writ petition was “not to discriminate the prisoners on the basis of the caste and forbearing the jail authority from confining Palayamkottai prison inmates on caste basis”. The writ petition was not entertained, as the High Court accepted the explanation of the State government that “the inmates belonging to different castes are housed in different blocks, in to avoid any community clash, which is prevailing common in Tirunelveli and Tuticorin Districts”. It was also noted that “there 244 Charles Sobraj v. Supdt., Central Jail, 1978 INSC 149 245 RK Kapoor Committee, pp. 157-160. 246 Sunil Batra (I) v. Delhi Administration (1978) 4 SCC 494 247 Hiralal Mallick v. State of Bihar (1977) 4 SCC 44 248 W.P. (MD) No. 6587 of 2012 (Madras High Court, dated 28 October 2014) 608 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports is rivalry between two groups on account of caste feeling, which is regular in the District and in to avoid any untoward incident and put an end to such rivalry, the Prison Authority is compelled to house the inmates of different communities in different blocks”. We cannot agree with the position taken by the High Court. It is the responsibility of the prison administration to maintain discipline inside the prison without resorting to extreme measures that promote caste-based segregation.
