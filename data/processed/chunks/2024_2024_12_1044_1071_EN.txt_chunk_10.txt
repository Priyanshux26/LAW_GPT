However, in view of Raj Kumar Karwal [Raj Kumar Karwal v. Union of India, (1990) 2 SCC 409 : 1990 SCC (Cri) 330] , a Section 53 officer investigating an offence under the NDPS Act can end up only by filing a complaint under Section 36-A(1) (d) of the NDPS Act. Shri Lekhi’s only answer to this anomaly is that under Section 36-A(5) of the NDPS Act, such trials will follow a summary procedure, which, in turn, will relate to a complaint where investigation is undertaken by a narcotics officer. First and foremost, trial procedure is post-investigation, and has nothing to do with the manner of investigation or cognizance, as was submitted by Shri Lekhi himself. Secondly, even assuming that the mode of trial has some relevance to this anomaly, Section 258 CrPC makes it clear that a summons case can be instituted “otherwise than upon complaint”, which would 1060 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports obviously refer to a summons case being instituted on a police report—see John Thomas v. K. Jagadeesan [John Thomas v. K. Jagadeesan, (2001) 6 SCC 30 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 974] (at para 8).” 23. It could be seen that while answering the said question, in paragraph 145, Nariman, J., while penning down the majority has observed that under Section 36-A(1)(a) of the NDPS Act, it was only offences which were punishable with imprisonment for a term of more than three years that were exclusively triable by the Special Court. 24. It is thus clear that the statutory scheme, according to the provisions of Section 36-A(5) of the NDPS Act, prescribes that, for convicting a person under Section 58 of the NDPS Act, he/she must be tried summarily. 25. Section 260 of the Cr.P.C. provides that the power to try summarily is with any Judicial Magistrate, any Metropolitan Magistrate or any Magistrate of the first class specially empowered in this behalf by the High Court. Section 262 of the Cr.P.C. provides that the procedure specified in this Code for the trial of summons-case shall be followed except as hereinafter mentioned. A detailed procedure has been provided for trial of summons cases by the Magistrate under Section 251 to 259 of the Cr.P.C. 26. It is thus clear that the learned Special Judge could not have conducted the proceedings against the present appellant for the offence punishable under Section 58 of the NDPS Act inasmuch as such proceedings could have been conducted only by a Magistrate. Undisputedly, the procedure as required under Chapter XX i.e. Sections 251 to 256 of the Cr.P.C. has also not been followed. b. Good Faith: 27. It will be relevant to refer to Section 69 of the NDPS Act, which reads thus: “69. Protection of action taken in good faith.—No suit, prosecution or other legal proceeding shall lie against the Central Government or a State Government or any officer of the Central Government or of the State Government or any other person exercising any powers or discharging any functions or performing any duties under this Act, for [2024] 12 S.C.R.
