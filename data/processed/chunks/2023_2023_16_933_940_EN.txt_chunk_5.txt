11. A perusal of the prayer made in the suit shows that in the alternative, only refund of earnest money along with interest has not been claimed, rather the respondent/plaintiff had claimed adequate damages, which may include refund of the earnest money along with interest. Merely refunding the earnest money paid, after sixty years will be unreasonable as the respondent, after booking the plot, has been waiting all along as even in the litigation since 1986. The price of the land in the area has increased manifold for the last sixty years. 940 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 12. The passed by the High Court in M/s Ashoka Enclave Plot-holders Association’s case (supra) does not come to the rescue of the appellant for the reason that in the aforesaid case, the civil suit was fi led by the appellants therein on 14.06.1991, nine years after the off er was made to them for allotment of alternative plot. The same was held to be beyond limitation. The argument of the appellant that the respondent had requested for refund of the earnest money paid by him vide letters dated 27.01.1975 and 1.01.1976 also deserves to be rejected as it was not responded to by the appellant. 13. Considering the aforesaid totality of the facts, in our view, the interest of justice will meet in case the impugned and decree of the High Court is modifi ed to the extent that instead of getting the sale deed of the plot registered @ ₹25/- per square yard, in the alternative, the appellant pays a total amount of ₹50,00,000/- to the respondent as full and fi nal settlement of claim in the suit. The amount is to be paid within a period of three months. 14. The present appeals are disposed of accordingly. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals disposed of. Nidhi Jain
