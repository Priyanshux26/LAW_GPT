These factors have a detrimental effect on maternal mortality and morbidity. Adolescent mothers are likely to develop lifelong health consequences from sexual encounters and childbearing. They are also more likely to be sterilized at an early age which is indicative of a lack of control over their choices.33 Families after bearing the desired number of offspring, force women to undergo sterilization to control further reproduction in the family.34 The high rate of sterilization found in women married as children would also lead to more unprotected sex which leads to a risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. 18. Lack of healthcare access in rural areas and for poor families may lead to further health complications and unsafe medical procedures including unsafe abortions.35 Further, women married as children are deprived of educational and employment opportunities thereby effacing them from public life. Education has an inversely proportional effect on child marriage. 87% of married adolescent girls did not attend school.36 In India, women having twelve or more years of schooling tend to marry much later than other women. The median age at first marriage for women between the age of 25-49 increases from 17.1 years for women with no schooling to 22.8 years for women with twelve or more years of schooling.37 This is in line with studies conducted at a global level which reflect that child marriages are 66% lower among girls who complete secondary education and 80% lower among those who pursue higher education.38 31 Ibid. 32 NFHS-5, 117. 33 Anita Raj (2010).

The age of consent 19. The trajectory of child marriage in India is stubborn and persistent. It has travelled centuries, and its opposition seems to have only incremental successes each time. Still widely prevalent,39 the first movement against child marriage in modern India began in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Social reformers were trying to build public opinion against child marriage. Two concerns primarily animated the call against child marriages by early reformers. The first was the high number of early widows.40 Because the rate of mortality was low, many girls found themselves in widowhood in the early years of their lives.
