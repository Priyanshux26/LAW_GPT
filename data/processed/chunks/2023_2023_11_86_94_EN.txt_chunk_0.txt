[2023] 11 S.C.R. 86 : 2023 INSC 708 CASE DETAILS M/S LARSEN AIR CONDITIONING AND REFRIGRATION COMPANY v. UNION OF INDIA AND ORS. (Civil Appeal No. 3798 of 2023) AUGUST 11, 2023 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT AND DIPANKAR DATTA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration : Whether the High Court erred in modifying the arbitral award to the extent of reducing the interest, from compound interest of 18% to 9% simple interest per annum. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.31 – Modifi cation of interest by the High Court – Propriety of: Held : In the instant case, given that the arbitration commenced in 1997, i.e., after the Act of 1996 came into force on 22.08.1996, the arbitrator, and the award passed by them, would be subject to this statute – Under the enactment, i.e. s.31(7), the statutory rate of interest itself is contemplated at 18% p.a. – This is in the event the award does not contain any direction towards the rate of interest – Therefore, there is little to no reason, for the High Court to have interfered with the arbitrator’s fi nding on interest accrued and payable – Unlike in the case of the old Act, the court is powerless to modify the award and can only set aside partially, or wholly, an award on a fi nding that the conditions spelt out u/s. 34 of the 1996 Act have been established. [Para 13] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.34 – Jurisdiction under: Held : The limited and extremely circumscribed jurisdiction of the court u/s. 34 of the Act, permits the court to interfere with an award, sans the grounds of patent illegality, i.e., that “illegality must go to the root of the matter and cannot be of a trivial nature”; and that the tribunal “must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an arbitrator construes a term of the contract in a reasonable manner, it will not mean that the 86 M/S LARSEN AIR CONDITIONING AND REFRIGRATION 87 COMPANY v. UNION OF INDIA award can be set aside on this ground”– The other ground would be denial of natural justice. [Para 15] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.37 – Scope of Appellate Court to review fi ndings: Held : In appeal, s.37 of the Act grants narrower scope to the appellate court to review the fi ndings in an award, if it has been upheld, or substantially upheld u/s. 34 – It is important to notice that the old Act contained a provision which enabled the court to modify an award – However, that power has been consciously omitted by Parliament, while enacting the Act of 1996 – This means that the Parliamentary intent was to exclude power to modify an award, in any manner, to the court.
