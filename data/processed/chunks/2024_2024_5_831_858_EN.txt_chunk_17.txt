157). 19 In Roy Estate v. State of Jharkhand (2009) 12 SCC 194; Union of India v. Mahendra Girji (2010) 15 SCC 682 and Union of India v. Mahendra Girji (2010) 15 SCC 682, this Court has underscored the importance of following the timelines fixed by the statute. In Mansaram v. S.P. Pathak (1984) 1 SCC 125, this Court has held that the powers relevant to the land acquisition process must be exercised within a reasonable time. In Kerala State Housing Board v. Ramapriya Hotels (P) Ltd. (1994) 5 SCC 672, this Court has held that if the concerned legislation does not stipulate the time-frames within which the process or its components are to be completed, it amounts to a violation of Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution. In Ram Chand v. Union of India (1994) 1 SCC 44, this Court has acknowledged the realisation of the Parliament that the authorities are not completing the acquisition proceedings within a reasonable time and thus, the Parliament has introduced time-limits. In Ambalal Purshottam v. Ahmedabad Municipal Corpn. (1968) 3 SCR 207, this Court held that a notification under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 must be followed by a proceeding for determination of compensation without any unreasonable delay. In Khadim Hussain v. State of U.P. (1976) 1 SCC 843, this Court held that excessive intervening delay between notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, keeping the landowner in suspense throughout, is illegal. 854 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports possession of the property in normal circumstances. The culmination of an acquisition process is not in the payment of compensation, but also in taking over the actual physical possession of the land. If possession is not taken, acquisition is not complete. With the taking over of actual possession after the normal procedures of acquisition, the private holding is divested and the right, title and interest in the property, along- with possession is vested in the State. Without final vesting, the State’s, or its beneficiary’s right, title and interest in the property is inconclusive and causes lot of difficulties. The obligation to conclude and complete the process of acquisition is also part of Article 300A. ii) Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Sections 4 and 5 of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952, Sections 37 and 38 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, and Sections 3D and 3E of the National Highways Act, 1956, statutorily recognise this right of the acquirer. iii) This step of taking over of possession has been a matter of great judicial scrutiny and this Court has endeavoured to construe the relevant provisions in a way which ensures non- arbitrariness in this action of the acquirer20. For that matter, after taking over possession, the process of land acquisition concludes with the vesting of the land with the concerned authority. The culmination of an acquisition process by vesting has been a matter of great importance.
