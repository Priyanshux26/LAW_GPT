Thus, this Bench is not limited to the questions framed by the three-Judge Bench. B. Submissions i. Appellants’ submissions 27. This Court held in Synthetics (7J) (supra) that denatured spirit is industrial alcohol and is outside the jurisdiction of States under Entry 8, List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. It held that Entry 8, List II deals only with potable alcohol. Mr Dinesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel representing the State of UP assailed the reasoning in Synthetics (7J) (supra) and argued that the States have jurisdiction over industrial alcohol. He submitted that: a. Legislative entries are fields of legislation and must be read widely and construed liberally to maintain the federal balance. The exclusive jurisdiction of the States cannot be ousted by a Parliamentary enactment. Article 245 of the Constitution is 1974 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports subject to Article 246 and therefore the division of legislative powers must be given their full effect; b. The term ‘intoxicating liquors’ appearing in Entry 8 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution has a rich history and legislative practice accompanying it; c. The term ‘intoxicating liquors’ in Entry 8 of List II is borrowed from Entry 31, List II of the 1935 Act. The 1935 Act was enacted by the British Parliament when the term ‘intoxicating liquors’ had attained a specific meaning. This meaning can be discerned from Section 110 of the License Consolidation Act 1910 and Sections 3, 4, 5, 116 of the Spirit Act 1880; d. In British legislations, the words ‘intoxicating liquors’ were defined to include spirit of all kinds including fermented and distilled spirits. The terms ‘intoxicating liquors’ and ‘spirit’ or ‘liquor of all kinds’ were used interchangeably in laws in England; e. Various provincial statutes defined the words ‘liquor’ and ‘sprit’ to include all liquids containing alcohol.58 These legislations were enacted with the knowledge that alcohol is used for industrial purposes. ‘Intoxicating liquors’ in Entry 8 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution is a comprehensive phrase which connotes all liquids containing alcohol. Therefore, liquor and spirit including industrial alcohol have always been under the jurisdiction of States; f. The 1935 Act used different phrases in Entries 31 and 40 of List II of its Seventh Schedule. These entries are relatable to Entries 8 and 51 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution respectively. Whereas the phrase ‘alcoholic liquor for human consumption’ is used in Entry 51 List II for taxation purposes, Entry 8 of List II uses the word ‘intoxicating liquors’. Similarly, Entry 84 of List I uses the phrase ‘alcoholic liquor not for human consumption’ and Article 47 uses the phrase ‘intoxicating drinks’. It would be irrational to presume that the framers of the Constitution used different phrases to mean the same thing; 58 Bombay Abkari Act 1878, Madras Abkari Act 1886, Bengal Excise Act 1909, Bihar Excise Act 1915, MP Excise Act 1915, Punjab Excise Act 1914, Chhattisgarh Excise Act 1915 and UP Excise Act 1910.
