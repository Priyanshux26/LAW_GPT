P. 41(b)). xi) The testimonies of the Doctors PWs, 10, 19, 25 and 26, clearly bring out that the injuries sustained by the deceased could be caused by means of M.O. 29, 30 and 33. This is an additional circumstance. xii) Ext.P41(c), which is the report of the Scientific Assistant (Chemistry), FSL, Thiruvananthapuram, clearly establishes that the black coloured ink in Item 66 (the marker pen with trade brand label as Kolor Pik permanent XL marker) and 67 (1 black coloured plastic cap) is similar to the ink used in the black coloured writings in Item 63 (wooden frame) item 64 (wall clock) with trade label samay and item 65 (calendar of Guruvayur Cooperative Urban Bank). Item numbers referred to here are the ones given for reference by the Scientific Assistant in her report. The Marker pen (part of M.O. 95) was recovered from the southern room where the Appellant was found, and rightly an inference has been drawn that the writings on M.O. 43 (Wall Clock) M.O. 90 (Mirror) and M.O. 94 (2005 Calendar) are the writings of the accused by using M.O 95 (marker pen) xiii) At the site where the hole was drilled, soil/powder was available. It is found in the forensic report that the soil/powder on M.O. 34 bag (found in the room where the accused was found) and seized as per Ext.P-12 scene mahazar, was apparently similar to the soil/powder seized near the hole. Equally so, in the M.O. 71 shirt belonging to the accused, apparently similar soil/ powder was found. These are established by the FSL report 928 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (Exh. 41(a)). Further, the nail clippings of the accused taken by PW-31 dated 14.11.2005 revealed apparently similar soil/ powder to the soil/powder found at the site of the hole as per FSL report (Exh. 41(a)). This is a circumstance relied upon by the prosecution to establish that the accused gained access through the hole that he dug. The argument of the accused that the nail clippings were taken on 14.11.2005 and no importance could be attached has rightly been rejected by the High Court saying that it is not even the case of the accused that the soil/ powder detected from the hole at the scene of occurrence was planted on his nail. Mr. Renjith B. Marar, learned counsel for the appellant contended that Exhibit P-41(a) report was not put in the Section 313 questioning in the context of the soil particles on the wall tallying with the soil particles in the nail clippings and on the shirt and the bag found in the room where the accused was present. We have called for the original record and examined the Section 313 statement and had the Malayalam version read over to us. We have also seen the translated version of Section 313. Exhibit P-41(a) was put in question no. 52 but it was in the context of item 68 cable and as to how it could be cut with the knives (item 22 and 23).
