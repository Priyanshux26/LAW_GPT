FEMC Pratibha Joint Venture / of the Supreme Court Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J. 1. The issue for consideration before us is whether the timeline for refund under Section 38(3) of the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 20041 must be mandatorily followed while recovering dues under the Act by adjusting them against the refund amount. 2. The brief facts relevant for our purpose are as follows.

The appellant did not pay the refund even until 2022, pursuant to which the respondent sent a letter dated 09.11.2022 for the consideration of their refund. The Value Added Tax Officer passed an adjustment dated 18.11.2022 to adjust the respondent’s claims for refund against dues under default notices dated 30.03.2020, 23.03.2021, 30.03.2021, and 26.03.2022.

Value Added Tax 1 Hereinafter ‘the Act’. 2 WP (C) 2491/2023, dated 21.09.2023 (‘Impugned ’). 340 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Officer, Ward 3003 to summarise the law on refund under Section 38. It held that the department must scrupulously adhere to the time limit for processing and issuing the refunds under Section 38. Whenever the department seeks to obtain necessary information under Section 59 of the Act, it must take steps within the time limit envisaged under the Act. Further, the refund amount can be adjusted only when an enforceable demand in the nature of tax or duty is pending against the assessee. The department does not have any legal right or justification to retain the amount beyond the time limit prescribed under Section 38.4 In the facts of the present case, it was held that the mandate of the Act has not been followed and hence the adjustment is not maintainable.5 5. We have heard the learned ASG for the department and Mr. Rajesh Jain, learned counsel for the respondent-assessee.
