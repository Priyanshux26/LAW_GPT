7. We, therefore, find no error in the reasoning adopted by the learned Single Judge, inasmuch as the learned Single Judge has relied on the of this Court in the case of State of Maharashtra v. Vishwnath Maranna Shetty.2 8. A perusal of the of the learned Single Judge would reveal that the learned Judge has basically rejected the appeal on the ground that the twin conditions as required under the provisions of the said Act i.e. (i) Satisfaction of the Court that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence; and (ii) He/she is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. While doing so, the learned Judge has given elaborate reasonings and has held that the appellant is not entitled to grant of bail. 9. However, it is to be noted that this Court in the case of Manish Sisodia v. Directorate of Enforcement,3 while considering the twin conditions, as applicable under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 has held that prolonged incarceration without the accused being made to face the trial would result in forcing him to face the sentence without undergoing the trial. In the said case of Manish Sisodia (supra), the Court has also held that the right to speedy trial is also one of the facets of the rights flowing from Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The said of this Court in the case of Manish Sisodia (supra), has been constantly followed in various other s including the case of Kalvakuntla Kavitha v. Directorate of Enforcement.4 10. The material placed on record would reveal that for a period of the last six years, out of 102 dates, the accused has not been produced 1 2024 INSC 645 : [2024] 7 SCR 992 : (2024) 9 SCC 813 2 2012 INSC 494 : [2012] 9 SCR 873 : (2012) 10 SCC 561 3 2024 INSC 595 : [2024] 8 SCR 1061 : 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1920 : 4 2024 INSC 632 : [2024] 8 SCR 717 : 2024 SCC OnLine SC 2269 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 841 Siddhant @ Sidharth Balu Taktode v. The State of Maharashtra and Another before the Court either physically or through virtual mode on most of the dates. On the last date, we had put a query to the learned counsel appearing for the State as to why the charges were not framed as of date in this case. Shri Kilor fairly states that the charges have not been framed in the cases which are registered prior to the registration of the present case. We may say with anguish that this is a very sorry state of affairs. If an accused is incarcerated for a period of approximately five years without even framing of charges, leave aside the right of speedy trial being affected, it would amount to imposing sentence without trial. In our view, such a prolonged delay is also not in the interest of the rights of the victim.
