In our view, the validity of the power exercised under Section 102(1) Cr.P.C. is not dependent on the compliance with the duty prescribed on the police officer under Section 102(3) Cr.P.C. The validity of the exercise 420 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of power under Section 102(1) Cr.P.C. can be questioned either on jurisdictional grounds or on the merits of the matter. That is to say, the of seizure can be challenged on the ground that the seizing officer lacked jurisdiction15 to act under Section 102(1) Cr.P.C. or that the seized item does not satisfy the definition of ‘property’16 or on the ground that the property which was seized could not have given rise to suspicion concerning the commission of a crime, in for the authorities to justify the seizure.17 The pre-requisite for exercising powers under Section 102(1) is the existence of a direct link between the tainted property and the alleged offence. It is essential that the properties sought to be seized under Section 102(1) of the Cr.P.C. must have a direct or close link with the commission of offence in question.18 14. As stated hereinbefore, the obligation to report the seizure to the Magistrate is neither a jurisdictional pre-requisite for exercising the power to seize nor is the exercise of such power made subject to compliance with the reporting obligation. Contrast this with Section 105E Cr.P.C., 1973 which provides for similar power of seizure and attachment of property. While Section 105E(1) confers the substantive power to make seizure under circumstances provided in that section, sub-section (2) of Section 105E declares that the passed under Section 105E(1) ‘shall have no effect unless the said is confirmed by an of the said Court, within a period of thirty days of its being made’. In that sense, the of seizure, for it to take effect and have legal force, is subjected to a further statutory requirement of the seizure being confirmed by an of Court. It is only upon passing of the confirmation within the stipulated period does the of seizure take effect. Until then, it remains an in form but without having any legal force. 15. We find that there are certain other provisions19 in the 1973 Code which place similar obligation(s) on the police officer to report their actions to the jurisdictional Magistrate. For example, Section 157 Cr.P.C. 15 Nevada Properties (P) Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra & Anr. (2019) 20 SCC 119 16 Ms Swaran Sabharwal Vs. Commissioner of Police, 1990 (68) Comp Cas 652 Delhi (DB) 17 State of Maharashtra Vs. Tapas D. Neogy,1999/INSC/417 18 Supra, 17. 19 See, Section 168 Cr.P.C. [2024] 6 S.C.R. 421 Shento Varghese v. Julfikar Husen & Ors. provides that ‘if, from information received or otherwise, an officer in charge of a police station has reason to suspect the commission of an offence……he shall forthwith send a report of the same to a Magistrate’. As in the case of Section 102(3) Cr.P.C., Section 157 Cr.P.C. does not provide for any consequence in the event there is failure to promptly comply with the reporting obligation.
