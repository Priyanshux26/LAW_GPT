The suit was not filed within a reasonable time as it was not filed from three years of the execution of the Agreement to Sell or from the date of death of Smt. Sushila Devi who had died on 25.12.1992. The suit was filed about two and a half years from the date of death of Sushila Devi and about four and a half years from the date of execution of the alleged Agreement to Sell. As such, no discretionary relief should be granted in such a case where a suit is filed with such delay. 21.5. The Agreement to Sell did not contain the specific boundaries of the land covered by the same and the same being vague, as such, no specific performance could have been granted. Possession has always remained with Sushila Devi and thereafter her legal heirs and now is with the transferees as has been held by the High Court. The sale deeds executed during the pendency of proceedings would not outrightly be declared as void but would only be subject to adjudication. Reliance is placed upon the following s: 4 (1999)‡ 3 SCC 573 (para 17) 5 (2005) 2 SCC 217 6 (2010) 10 SCC 512 (para 17 & 21) 7 (2024) SCC OnLine SC 981 ‡ Ed.

Nank Builders & Investors (P) Ltd.8 - Yogesh Goyanka v. Govind9 21.6. On the above submissions, no discretionary reliefs should be granted to the plaintiff-appellants and the High Court has rightly declined the same. 22. On behalf of the intervenor, in addition to what has been submitted on behalf of the respondents, further submissions are summarised hereunder:- 22.1. Bona Fide Purchaser Without Notice: The intervenor argued that they purchased the suit property (22 acres) from Respondent Nos. 4 to 7 on 26/03/2012 and 31/03/2012 through a registered sale deed for a total consideration of Rs. 7.92 crores. At the time of the purchase, the intervenor had no knowledge of the pending litigation. They only became aware of the appeals after the purchase and filed the intervention applications accordingly. 22.2. Lis Pendens Doctrine Not Applicable: The intervenor submitted that the doctrine of lis pendens under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, does not apply in their case as the sale took place after the High Court’s on 15/03/2012 and before the Supreme Court’s on 30/04/2012 directing the parties to maintain the status quo. Therefore, they asserted that no litigation was pending during this period, and the transfer of the property was lawful. 22.3. Registered Sale Deeds Valid: The intervenor contended that no relief can be granted to the appellants in the absence of a specific challenge to the registered sale deeds executed in their favor. They argued that as bona fide purchasers for value, their rights should be protected. 22.4. Agreement to Sell and Specific Performance: The intervenor further highlighted that the Agreement to Sell dated 30.08.1990 was vague and lacked specific details regarding the boundaries 8 (2013) 5 SCC 397 (para 53) 9 (2024) SCC OnLine SC 1692 (para 16 & 17) 2398 [2024] 11 S.C.R.
