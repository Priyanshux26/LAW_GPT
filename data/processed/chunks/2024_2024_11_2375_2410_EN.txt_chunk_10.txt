As a result, the four sale [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2391 Shyam Kumar Inani v. Vinod Agrawal & Ors. deeds dated 18.01.2001 were declared null and void. 17.5. In its final findings, the Trial Court ruled that the appellants had been ready and willing to perform their obligations under the agreement. The suit was found to be within the period of limitation, as the cause of action arose when the legal heirs of Sushila Devi refused to execute the sale deed after her death. 17.6. The Trial Court directed that Defendant Nos. 1 to 5 must execute the sale deed in favour of the plaintiff within two months and further declared the sale deeds executed in favour of Defendant Nos. 7 to 10 as null and void. 18. Now, we briefly refer to the reasoning and findings of the High Court in allowing the appeal. 18.1. The High Court first scrutinized the Agreement to Sell dated 30.08.1990, emphasizing that it was not registered, and the sale consideration appeared to be significantly below the market rate prevailing at the time of the alleged transaction. The High Court found this to be an indicator of potential mala fides on the part of the plaintiff-appellants. 18.2. Furthermore, the High Court noted that the agreement lacked specific details concerning the boundaries of the disputed land, leading to ambiguity about the property that was to be conveyed. 18.3. On the issue of possession, the High Court observed that while the appellants claimed to have been put in possession of the land by Sushila Devi, there was no substantial evidence to corroborate this assertion. 18.4. The High Court found that the appellants had failed to convincingly establish their possession of the land in question, which significantly weakened their case for specific performance. 18.5. In addition, the High Court placed significant weight on the fact that the appellants did not enter the witness box to testify in support of their claims. Instead, the appellants relied on their Power of Attorney holder, Pankaj Maheshwari, to provide testimony. The High Court emphasized that while a Power of Attorney holder may testify regarding facts within their personal knowledge, critical facts regarding the execution of the 2392 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Agreement to Sell could only be testified to by the appellants themselves. The failure of the appellants to take the witness stand led the High Court to draw an adverse inference under the established legal principle that the best evidence should be produced, especially when a party to the agreement is alive and capable of testifying. 18.6. The High Court further examined the issue of fraud and misrepresentation, which had been raised by the defendants. It found that the entire transaction was shrouded in suspicion, given the low consideration, the alleged absence of clear possession by the plaintiffs, and the fact that the legal heirs of Sushila Devi were unaware of the agreement. The High Court concluded that the burden of proving the validity of the agreement rested on the appellants, particularly in light of the defence of fraud, but the appellants had failed to discharge this burden satisfactorily.
