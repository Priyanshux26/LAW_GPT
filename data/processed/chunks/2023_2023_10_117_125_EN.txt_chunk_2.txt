The management thereupon issued s dated 10/ G 17.11.2000, 24/26.11.2000 and 27.11.2000, implementing the Award. The workmen were absorbed in regular service and paid 75% of their back wages from 10.05.1990 up to 18.03.1997 and full wages, applicable to Class IV, for the period thereafter. This compliance was made subject to the final outcome of the writ petition. H 120 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 6. However, a learned Judge of the Jharkhand High Court dismissed CWJC No. 953 of 1998 (R), vide dated 01.11.2018. The learned Judge affirmed the finding of the Tribunal that the workmen concerned had worked in the FCI at Patna for 240 days in the preceding 12 months and were then stopped from doing so without complying with the mandatory provisions of Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, B 1947. Further, the learned Judge noted that the management did not controvert the claim of the workmen that similarly situated persons had been regularized in service pursuant to the earlier passed by the High Court and it did not cite any factor to distinguish the cases of the workmen in question from those of the workmen so regularized. Having C said so, the learned Judge observed that a casual employee who worked for 240 days in the preceding calendar year would only be entitled to reinstatement in service, if his termination from service is without notice or compensation in lieu thereof, as provided under Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and he would not be entitled to seek regularization in service. However, as the management had chosen to D comply with the impugned Award, without abiding by the condition imposed in the interim passed in the writ petition, and as the workmen concerned had been availing the benefit of the impugned Award for more than 18 years, the learned Judge opined that it would cause great hardship to them if the position was changed at that stage. The E learned Judge, accordingly, dismissed the writ petition, upholding the Award in its entirety. 7. The matter was thereupon carried in appeal by the management before a Division Bench of the Jharkhand High Court in LPA No. 80 of 2019. By dated 17.12.2020, the Division Bench modified the F under appeal, by quashing the Award to the extent that it directed regularization of the services of the workmen. This modification was made on the ground that such relief could not be sustained when there was no term of regularization in the reference of the industrial dispute. The Division Bench disposed of the appeal by setting aside the of the learned Judge declining to interfere with the Award in so far as it G directed regularization of services, but left untouched the direction to pay 75% of the back wages. 8. Both sides are in appeal before this Court against the of the Division Bench. The Executive Staff Union of FCI filed an appeal on behalf of the workmen concerned, aggrieved by the denial of H THEIR WORKMEN THROUGH THE JOINT SECRETARY (WELFARE), FCI 121 EXECUTIVE STAFF UNION.
