The process pursuant to which a treaty acquires the force and eff ect of domestic law was for long referred to by German theorists as a ‘transformation’ (i.e., as the promulgation of a domestic statute parallel to the treaty and incorporating the treaty text). A similar view can also be found, though often not very explicit, in other countries.54 This theory, however cannot explain why, among other things, the treaty, even after parliamentary consent, becomes applicable domestically only when it enters into force under international law or why it loses its binding force internally when it is rescinded or terminated at the international level. For these reasons, the German doctrine of international law abandoned the transformation theory. Parliamentary consent is now understood as a mandate through which the treaty itself - rather than a corresponding internal legislative provision - becomes applicable within the scope of domestic law.55 51. The point in time at which a treaty enters into force internationally and the point at which it becomes applicable under domestic law must be distinguished from the point in time at which the material consequences of the treaty begin to take eff ect, or, in other words, the taxable period or the date from which taxation shall be limited by the treaty (the eff ective date). Usually this ‘initiation of treaty eff ects’ is established by explicit treaty rules. Various aspects may be of importance here. Treaty rules in particular often distinguish between treaty eff ects on assessed taxes and those on withholding taxes. In general, the material eff ects of tax treaties apply retrospectively, viewed from the date of entry into force under international law; detrimental retrospectivity, however, may be prohibited. 54 See, e.g., Canadian Supreme Court of 28 September 1982, The Queen v.

Through the mandate of the legislature, treaties in most States obtain the same authority as internal law. In some States they are even considered to have priority over domestic law.56” F.
