12. The petitioner stated that since the respondents were not paying heed to his repeated requests for issuance of share certificates, the petitioner sent a Common Notice dated 23.01.2017 (hereinafter referred to as “Arbitration Notice”) to both the respondents, directing them to either issue the share certificates evidencing allotment of 2,00,010 and 4,00,000 shares respectively or in the alternate, to return the amount equivalent to those shares. The same was received by both the respondents on 24.01.2017. In the event of a dispute, the Arbitration Notice called upon the respondents to appoint arbitrators in terms of Clause 13.10 of the Shareholders Agreement. The said clause is reproduced hereinbelow: "13.10. Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising under or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation any dispute concerning the existence or enforceability hereof, shall be resolved by arbitration in Mumbai in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The dispute will be referred to the arbitrator, and Gumpro has right to appoint 2 (two) arbitrators and Other Shareholder have the right to appoint 1(one) arbitrator. All these three (03) arbitrators, will appoint one of them to act as umpire of the arbitral tribunal. The language of the arbitration shall be English. Any arbitration award by the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding upon the Parties, shall not be subject to appeal, and shall be enforced by of a court of competent jurisdiction.” 13. As there was no response from the respondents, the petitioner filed two separate applications dated 03.03.2017 under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996, bearing Arbitration Application No. 50 of 2017 for adjudication of disputes pertaining to the 4,00,000 equity shares and Arbitration Application No. 51 of 2017 for adjudication of disputes pertaining to 2,00,010 equity shares, before the High Court of Bombay, praying for the appointment of an arbitral tribunal. 14. After nearly 10 months from the date of the arbitration notice, on 07.11.2017, the respondents sent a reply denying and disputing all [2024] 12 S.C.R. 119 Aslam Ismail Khan Deshmukh v. Asap Fluids Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. the claims and allegations made by the petitioner. Without prejudice to the contentions in the reply, the respondents appointed two arbitrators in terms of clause 13.10 of the Shareholders Agreement and called upon the petitioner to nominate the third arbitrator. It was asserted that the alleged claim of 2,00,010 shares or the value thereof cannot be referred to arbitration as it does not fall within the remit of the dispute resolution clause of the Shareholders Agreement. 15. The High Court of Bombay vide and final dated 22.02.2019 held that the petitioner is a Non-Resident Indian who habitually resides and works in Dubai. The proceedings would constitute an “international commercial arbitration” and therefore, the Section 11 applications filed before it were not maintainable. 16. In light of the above and upon the dismissal of the Section 11 applications by the High Court, the petitioner has filed the present petitions before this Court i.e., Arbitration Petition No.20 and Arbitration Petition No.
