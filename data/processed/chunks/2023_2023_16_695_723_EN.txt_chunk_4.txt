[HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] even those of the Single Judge of the Bombay High Court in Nozer Gustad Commissariat (supra) and Antonio Joao Fernandes (supra), although each of these decisions were binding on the court, while it was deciding Kokate. 6. It was accordingly expressed that the decision in Kokate (supra) is per incuriam as it was rendered without considering relevant and binding precedents. The learned Judge also opined that the fundamental focus of S. 109A & S. 109B of the Companies Act, 1956 and Bye-law 9.11.7 of the Depositories Act is not the law of succession nor it is intended to restrict the law of succession in any manner. Addressing the mischief that was sought to be avoided by the two statutory provisions, the court observed that it was intended to aff ord the company or the depository in question, a legally valid quittance so that it does not remain answerable forever to succession litigations and endless slew of claims under the succession law. It was therefore opined that the statutory provisions allow for the liability to be moved from the company or the depository to the nominee but the nominee continues to hold the shares/securities in fi duciary capacity and is also answerable to all claims in the succession law. 7. With the above understanding of the legal provisions, the learned Judge declared that the view in Kokate (supra) generates inconsistencies as it renders a nomination under the Companies Act the status of a ‘superwill’ that is bereft of the rigour applicable to a will for its making or the test of its validity under the Indian Succession Act, 1925. According to the ruling, S. 109A & S. 109B of the Companies Act, 1956 and the Bye-law 9.11 of the Depositories Act, 1996 does not displace the law of succession nor does it stipulate a third line of succession. 8. Even while declaring Kokate (supra) to be per incuriam, it was made clear that the aforesaid (31.3.2015) does not dispose of the Notice of Motion No. 822/2014 in Suit No. 503/2014 and Chamber Summons No. 72/2014 in Testamentary Petition No. 457/2014 and those were posted for fi nal hearing on the basis of the law as declared. 9. The appellants being aggrieved by the decision (dated 31.3.2015) of the learned Single Judge, fi led Appeal No. 313/2015 to challenge the . Appeal No. 311/2015 was also fi led in the Testamentary Petition No. 457/2014. 702 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 10.While dealing with the appeals, the Division Bench at the outset noticed that the consideration to be made is whether the view taken by the learned Single Judge vis-a-vis the Kokate (supra) is the correct opinion. Accordingly, the following questions were formulated for decision in the appeals: “(i) Whether a nominee of a holder of shares or securities appointed under Section 109A of the Companies Act, 1956 read with the Bye- laws under the Depositories Act, 1996 is entitled to the benefi cial ownership of the shares or securities subject matter of nomination to the exclusion of all other persons who are entitled to inherit the estate of the holder as per the law of succession?
