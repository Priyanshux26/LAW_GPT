The assertion that the establishment and incorporation of a university through legislation inherently preclude it from being classified as a minority institution is unfounded. Such a contention arises from a misinterpretation of the decision in Azeez Basha [supra], which was specific to a particular statute and addressed a legislative framework predating the Constitution, enacted by a colonial authority. 258. It was noticed in Yashpal [supra] that a university lacking infrastructure or educational facilities would still have the authority to grant degrees, potentially resulting in significant dis in coordinating and upholding standards in higher education, which could detrimentally affect the entire nation. Therefore, it was in the larger public interest that this Court, held that the establishment of a university by the State, exercising its sovereign power, ought to occur through a legislative enactment. It held that insofar as private universities are concerned, “established or incorporated” should be read conjunctively and further that “a private university can only be established by a separate Act or by one compendious Act where the legislature specifically provides for establishment of the said university”. 259. It can be seen through various enactments8 that universities are established by the ‘sponsor’ who designs the administrative 8 See The Amity University Uttar Pradesh Act, 2005; The Galgotias University Uttar Pradesh Act, 2011; The Bennett University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh Act, 2016; The Mohammad Ali Jauhar University Act, 2005; The Era University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh Act, 2016; Maulana Azad University, Jodhpur Act, 2013. 2032 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports framework, considering the minimum requirements outlined in the regulations. The “sponsor”, typically a society, also arranges the necessary properties, including land and buildings. Subsequently, the University may either be recognized as deemed to be a university under Section 3 of the UGC Act, or it may be formally established and incorporated on behalf of the sponsor through a statutory enactment. 260. As stated above, there exists substantial legislative frameworks of minority Universities established by statute. The said statutes highlight the predominantly minority orientation of these institutions with peripheral non-minority elements. As stated above, the said legislative enactments and their examination reveals that a significant level of autonomy was retained by the sponsoring entity, with pivotal decision-making authority vested therein. In some instances, specific provisions were made for religion-based reservations as well through the legislation itself. Therefore, the appropriate Legislature, in its wisdom, can certainly establish, incorporate, or recognize a minority University, and include appropriate provisions to imbue the University with a minority identity. Therefore, the UGC Act or the in Yashpal [supra], in no manner, come to the aid of the parties challenging the correctness of the in Azeez Basha [supra]. p. ncmeI act and the amendment 261. According to the parties challenging the judgement of the High Court, the error that since a University requires a statute for establishment and statutory establishment renders such University to be non-minority, was furthered under the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the “NCMEI Act”). The said enactment and its definition clause, excluded universities from being certified as ‘Minority Educational Institution’.
