This Court allowed the challenge on the following grounds: a. The phrase ‘intoxicating liquor’ in Entry 8 means ‘liquor which is consumable by human being as it is” for the following reasons: (i) In FN Balsara (supra), this Court was not aware [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1963 State of U.P. & Ors. v. M/s Lalta Prasad Vaish and sons of the full use of alcohol as industrial alcohol;26 and (ii) Only two decisions of this Court have dealt with industrial alcohol. One was the decision in Synthetics (2J) (supra) and the other was the decision in Indian Mica and Micancite Industries v. State of Bihar27 in which this Court held that Parliament had the legislative competence to levy tax on alcoholic liquor not fit for human consumption;28 b. The provisions that are challenged are not regulatory but seek to levy a tax.29 List II does not confer the State Legislature the power to levy of tax on industrial alcohol;30 c. In view of Item 26 of the First Schedule to IDRA, the control of alcohol industries vests exclusively in the Union. Thus, the power to issue licenses to manufacture both potable and non- potable alcohol vests in the Central Government;31 d. The State can also not regulate industrial alcohol as a ‘product’ of the controlled industry in terms of Entry 33 of List III because the Union occupies the whole field on industrial alcohol as evinced by Section 18G of the IDRA;32 e. Even otherwise, the impugned provisions do not regulate a product of the scheduled industry. Rather, they deal with the manufacture and sale of industrial alcohol;33 f. The power of the States to legislate on the subject of alcohol is restricted to laws which (paragraph 86 of Synthetics (7J) (supra)): i. Prohibit potable alcohol in terms of Entry 6 of List II which concerns public health; ii. Lay down regulations to ensure that non-potable alcohol is not diverted and misused as a substitute for potable alcohol; 26 (1990) 1 SCC 109 [74] 27 [1971] Supp. 1 SCR 319 : (1971) 2 SCC 236 28 (1990) 1 SCC 109 [75] 29 On the distinction between tax and fee (see (1990) 1 SCC 109 [69-73] 30 (1990) 1 SCC 109 [83] 31 (1990) 1 SCC 109 [85] 32 (1990) 1 SCC 109 [85] 33 (1990) 1 SCC 109 [85] 1964 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports iii. Charge excise duty on potable alcohol and sales tax under Entry 52 of List II. However, sales tax cannot be charged on industrial alcohol; and iv. Charge fees on a quid pro quo basis, in return for some service rendered by the state, as distinct from fees for grant of a privilege in terms of Indian Mica (supra). 13. However, the in paragraph 88 makes the following observations: “On an analysis of the aforesaid decisions and practice, we are clearly of the opinion that in respect of industrial alcohol the States are not authorised to impose the impost they have purported to do.
