None of the parties have made any prima facie case for grant of interim s. In fact, the plaintiffs have come forward with the applications seeking interim directions based upon their C apprehension that resolutions may be passed in respect of amendment of the Rules and Regulations of the 1st Defendant/ Party. This Court, cannot imagine what would be going to take place during the General Council meeting held on 23.06.2022 and issued interim s/directions in advance. In fact, it is well settled D that in matter of internal issues of an association/Party, the Courts normally do not interfere, leaving it open to the association/party and its members to pass resolutions and frame a particular bye- law, rule or regulation for better administration of the Party since any decision comes forth among the Members of the General Council, it is well within their collective wisdom and this Court E cannot insist the Members to act upon in a particular manner. It is for the General Council and its members to decide and pass resolutions and this Court cannot interfere with the process of conducting the General Council meeting. Therefore, this Court is not inclined to pass any interim s/directions, except making F it clear that the General Council meeting which is scheduled to be held on 23.06.2022 shall go on. Issue Notice to the respondents returnable by 11.07.2022. Private notice is also permitted. List the matters on 11.07.2022.” G 6.8. The aforesaid dated 22.06.2022 was questioned by the plaintiff of CS No. 111 of 2022 before the Division Bench of the High Court in OSA No. 160 of 2022.Taking note of the case of the plaintiff- appellant in the said intra-court appeal, the Division Bench of the High Court issued directions in the manner that the General Council meeting H 1132 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A slated on 23.06.2022 could go on but no decision would be taken on any item other than 23 items mentioned in the draft resolution. While issuing notice, the Division Bench observed and directed in its dated 23.06.2022 as under: - “11. Since the draft resolution approved by the respondents 4 and B 5 does not contain an item with regard to the amendment of the Rule- 20A 1 to 13, 45 and 45 (sic), we are of the view that the appellant has made out a prima facie case for the grant of an of interim injunction. In the event of not granting any interim in the above petition, the appellant and the 4th respondent would be greatly prejudiced. Further, if an of injunction is C not granted, the prayer sought for in the suit will become infructuous. We are also of the view that the interim injunction sought for by the petitioner to prohibit the respondents from conducting the General Council Meeting cannot be granted. However, the General Council can discuss and take decisions D only with regard to 23 items mentioned in the draft resolution, which has been approved by the respondents 4 and 5.
