In Kannadasan this Court had interpreted the provisions to the effect that the Validation Act would confer a right on the State Government to make fresh levy and collection of dues which were collectable upto 04.04.1991. This interpretation was, however, not accepted by three-judge Bench. It was observed that the Validation Act could not be construed to confer a right to make a levy or collection of the cess and taxes on the minerals which were collected upto 04.04.1991, as was held in Kannadasan. It merely validated the collections already made so that the State will not be burdened with the liability of refunding the amount, already collected under void law. Therefore, the contrary view expressed in Kannadasan was held to be not correct. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1821 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. 26.12 With reference to Article 265 of the Constitution, it was observed that the State laws which stood expired on various dates prior to 04.04.1991 and on 04.04.1991 did not authorise imposition and collection of taxes and cess on minerals after 04.04.1991 in respect of minerals extracted till 04.04.1991, on which the cess was collectable. It was observed that object of the Validation Act was only to confer the life to void statutes by fictional re-enactment and granting legislative competence for limited purpose so that the State would not be called upon to refund the cess already collected under such void law. Thus, the void laws never existed after 04.04.1991 and consequently, there was no right with the State to make any levy or collection of the cess, which was collectable up to 04.04.1991. Only past actions had been sought to be validated, that too, by a fictional enactment of the State laws by Parliament, keeping it alive till 04.04.1991. Even if imposition of levy had been made but not collected, the same could not be collected after 04.04.1991 as the Validation Act had not provided any provision permitting State to levy or collection after 04.04.1991. Therefore, it was held that the States cannot be conferred a right to levy or collection after 04.04.1991. Therefore, to that extent Kannadasan’s observations were not approved. 26.13 The overruling of certain observations made in Kannadasan by the three-judge Bench in Tata Iron and Steel does not touch upon the question whether imposition of cess and other taxes on the basis of royalty or in addition to royalty by a State legislature is competent. The in Tata Iron and Steel on the other hand proceeds on the premise that India Cement and Orissa Cement were rightly decided. The Validation Act had been passed by the Parliament and there being a confusion with regard to the actual collection of the levies by the States on or after 04.04.1991 and in Kannadasan, this Court having held that it could be so in the form of arrears and dues, to that extent, disapproved Kannadasan. 26.14 I do not find any inconsistency between the s in Kannadasan and Tata Iron and Steel on the questions of whether royalty is a tax and whether the States had no 1822 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
