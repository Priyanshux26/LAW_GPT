Thus, Section 6A of the Citizenship Act does not violate Article 29(1) of the Constitution for the above reasons. v. Section 6A(3) is constitutional 103. Justice Pardiwala in his opinion has concluded that Section 6A(3) is unconstitutional for the following reasons: 169 “The Assam Official language Act” 170 The Assam Official Language Act 1960, Section 3 171 The Assam Official Language Act 1960, Section 4. The adoption of any other language for the administrative or official purposes of the region must be by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting. 172 The Assam Official Language Act 1960, “Section 5. The adoption of any other language for the administrative or official purposes of the region must be by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting” 173 The Assam Official Language Act 1960, Section 7. 1298 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports a. The low detection of immigrants who entered Assam between 1966-71 is attributable to the manifest arbitrariness of the mechanism prescribed by Section 6A(3); b. Section 6A(3) mandates that for migrants to register as citizens, they must be detected as foreigners. However, the mechanism does not provide for self-declaration or voluntary detection as a foreigner. The process of detection can only be set in motion by the State.174 This is a clear departure from the scheme of the Citizenship Act and Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution which allows acquiring citizenship through registration;175 and c. Section 6A(3) does not prescribe an outer time limit for the detection of an immigrant to Assam as a foreigner. This militates against the purpose of the provision and is arbitrary for the following reasons: i. The name of a person who is detected as a foreigner today would be deleted from the electoral rolls for ten years from the date of detection. This consequence is not in consonance with the object of the provision which was early detection, deportation and conferment of citizenship;176 ii. Placing the onus on the State to detect a foreigner coupled with the absence of temporal limit allows immigrants to continue to be on the electoral rolls and enjoy being de-facto citizens;177 and iii. Section 6A(3) incentivizes undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh to stay in Assam indefinitely until they are detected as Foreigners since they will be able to acquire citizenship only if they are ‘ordinarily resident’ in Assam.178 174 Paragraphs 121-123 of the of Justice Pardiwala 175 Ibid, 128 176 Ibid, 159 “Thus, an immigrant whose name figures in the electoral roll, despite being a foreigner continues to be eligible to vote in the elections till that person is detected as a foreigner and the name of that person is struck off the electoral roll. There being no temporal limit to the applicability of Section 6A, this situation would continue in the years to come till the detection exercise is completed.” 177 Ibid, 162 178 Ibid, 163 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1299 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 104.
