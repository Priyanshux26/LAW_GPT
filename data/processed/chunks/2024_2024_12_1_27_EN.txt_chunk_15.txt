Pertinently, the core allegations in both the complaints [2024] 12 S.C.R. 23 Subrata Choudhury @ Santosh Choudhury & Ors. v. The State of Assam & Anr. were identical. In the circumstances, the instant matter is completely covered by the decision of this Court in Talukdar as explained in Jatinder Singh and Poonam Chand Jain. The High Court was thus not justified in holding the second complaint to be maintainable.” 27. Now, we will have to proceed with the appeal bearing in mind the exposition of law in Samta Naidu’s case (supra) that if earlier disposal of the complaint was on merits and in a manner known to law, the second complaint on ‘almost identical facts’ which were raised in the first complaint would not be maintainable. “If the core of both the complaints is same, the second complaint ought not to be entertained,” it was further held therein. In the light of the factual narration with respect to the disposal of the original complaint dated 11.11.2010, made hereinbefore and in view of the courses open to a Magistrate on receipt of a negative report and applying the exposition of law in Samta Naidu’s case (supra) with respect to the maintainability of a second complaint we have no hesitation to hold that the maintainability of the second complaint dated 20.07.2011 filed by the second respondent would depend upon the question whether the core of the original complaint dated 11.11.2010 and the second complaint dated 20.07.2011 is the same as the disposal of the complaint dated 11.11.2010 was on merits and in a manner known to law. In this context, it is also to be noted after considering the final report, the protest complaint and admittedly, upon hearing the counsel for the complainant the protest petition was rejected not only by finding that the investigation suffers from no infirmity but also by finding that since it was conducted properly, no for further investigation is invited and further that the materials are not sufficient to take cognizance. As noted earlier, despite the said nature of the dated 06.06.2011 the second respondent-complainant has not chosen to challenge the same but, chosen only to file a fresh complaint, viz., the second complaint dated 20.07.2011. 28. In the contextual situation, it is relevant to note that earlier the learned Magistrate invoking the power under Section 202 Cr.P.C., postponed the issuance of summons. After recording the initial deposition of the complainant and the witnesses vide dated 19.09.2011, he directed for police investigation and report. The High Court as per dated 24.05.2012 in Criminal Petition No. 12/2012 set aside the dated 19.09.2011 and directed the appellants herein to 24 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports file appropriate application raising the issue of maintainability and in turn, directing the learned CJM to decide on the maintainability expeditiously. The dated 12.07.2012 was passed by the learned CJM in compliance with the direction in the dated 24.05.2012. 29. The dated 12.07.2012 of the learned CJM where under he discussed the second complaint dated 20.07.2011 would undoubtedly reveal that after taking into consideration the entire factual background of the case and the nature of disposal of the original complaint dated 11.11.2010 under the dated 06.06.2011 the application filed by the appellant herein raising maintainability of the second complaint was considered by the learned CJM.
