No doubt, ordinarily that would be the position. The moot question, however, is as to whether such a course of action has to be necessarily adopted by the High Court in all cases, while dealing with an application under Section 11 of the Act or is there room for play in the joints and the High Court is not divested of exercising discretion under some circumstances? If yes, what are those circumstances? It is this very aspect which was specifi cally dealt with by this Court 100 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. in Tripple Engg. Works [North Eastern Railway v. Tripple Engg. Works, (2014) 9 SCC 288 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 30]. Taking note of various s, the Court pointed out that the notion that the High Court was bound to appoint the arbitrator as per the contract between the parties has seen a signifi cant erosion in recent past. In paras 6 and 7 of the said decision, those s wherein departure from the aforesaid “classical notion” has been made are taken note of. It would, therefore, be useful to reproduce the said paragraph along with paras 8 and 9 hereinbelow: (SCC pp. 291-93) “6. The ‘classical notion’ that the High Court while exercising its power under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter for short ‘the Act’) must appoint the arbitrator as per the contract between the parties saw a signifi cant erosion in ACE Pipeline Contracts (P) Ltd. v. Bharat Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. [(2007) 5 SCC 304], wherein this Court had taken the view that though the contract between the parties must be adhered to, deviations therefrom in exceptional circumstances would be permissible. A more signifi cant development had come in a decision that followed soon thereafter in Union of India v. Bharat Battery Mfg. Co. (P) Ltd. [(2007) 7 SCC 684] wherein following a three-Judge Bench decision in Punj Lloyd Ltd. v. Petronet MHB Ltd. [(2006) 2 SCC 638], it was held that once an aggrieved party fi les an application under Section 11(6) of the Act to the High Court, the opposite party would lose its right of appointment of the arbitrator(s) as per the terms of the contract. The implication that the Court would be free to deviate from the terms of the contract is obvious. 7. The apparent dichotomy in ACE Pipeline [(2007) 5 SCC 304]and Bharat Battery Mfg. Co. (P) Ltd. [(2007) 7 SCC 684] was reconciled by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Northern Railway Admn., Ministry of Railway v. Patel Engg. Co. Ltd. [(2008) 10 SCC 240], wherein the jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 11(6) of the Act was sought to be emphasised by taking into account the expression ‘to take the necessary measure’ appearing in sub-section (6) of Section 11 LOMBARDI ENGINEERING LTD. v. UTTARAKHAND JAL 1001 VIDYUT NIGAM LTD. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] and by further laying down that the said expression has to be read along with the requirement of sub-section (8) of Section 11 of the Act.
