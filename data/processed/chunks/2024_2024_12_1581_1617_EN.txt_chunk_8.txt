Though the learned Single Judge had upheld the objection of the appellant and had set aside the clarification, Division Bench of the High Court while upholding the decision of the learned Single Judge and this Court while setting aside both the s of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench, did not examine this aspect of the matter. 30.3. It is also contended that learned Arbitrator had terminated the arbitral proceedings vide the award dated 16.12.1997 followed by the corrigendum dated 18.12.1997. No application having been moved for rectification of any clerical or calculation error within 30 days in terms of Section 33 of the 1996 Act and the respondent having not challenged the award under Section 34 of the said Act, learned Arbitrator could not have introduced any correction to the award, that too, in the manner in which it has been done. In the award, he had granted simple interest whereas by way of clarification, the same was changed to compound interest. 30.4. It is settled law that Section 33 is the only provision in the 1996 Act which allows correction of clerical errors. In the garb of clarification or correcting clerical errors, learned Arbitrator introduced substantial change in the award. In any view of the matter, the power under Section 33 of the 1996 Act could not have been exercised by the learned Arbitrator more than 6 years after passing of the award. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1593 North Delhi Municipal Corporation v. M/s. S.A. Builders Ltd. 31. Respondent in its counter affidavit has stated that the special leave petition out of which the present civil appeal arises is totally misconceived and is an abuse of the process of law. 31.1. Learned Arbitrator vide the award dated 16.12.1997 had awarded a sum of Rs. 1,70,70,720.80 (corrected to Rs. 1,70,40,720.80) alongwith interest @ 18% per annum in favour of the respondent. In the course of the execution proceeding, the executing court i.e. the learned Single Judge referred the matter to the Division Bench on the question as to whether under Section 31(7) of the 1996 Act, post-award interest would be on the principal sum adjudged or would be on the principal sum plus interest on the principal sum which had accrued from the date of the cause of action to the date of passing of the award. Division Bench permitted the respondent to seek clarification from the learned Arbitrator. This was challenged by the appellant before this Court by way of a special leave petition. However, the said special leave petition was dismissed. It was, thereafter, that the clarification was issued by the learned Arbitrator. Appellant never challenged the clarified award under Section 34 of the 1996 Act; instead approached the executing court. The executing court i.e. learned Single Judge had erroneously set aside the clarification. Appeal filed by the respondent against such was dismissed by the Division Bench. When the respondent had approached this Court by filing special leave petition, a three-Judge Bench of this Court had already decided the issue in M/s.
