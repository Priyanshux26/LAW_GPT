[2024] 7 S.C.R. 532 : 2024 INSC 486 Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors. (Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024) 09 July 2024 [Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, CJI, J.B. Pardiwala* and Manoj Misra, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Scope of judicial review of the actions of the State in the matters relating to contract/tender disputes under writ jurisdiction; whether the action on the part of the respondent in cancelling the tender was amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court; if so, whether the said action could be termed as arbitrary or unfair and in consequence of violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Headnotes† Contract/tender disputes – Judicial review – Scope – Tender awarded to the appellant on Public-Private Partnership basis for maintenance of two underpasses was cancelled by the respondent-Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority stating that there was a technical fault therein and also on account of a change in policy whereby, the operation & maintenance of the concerned underpasses was handed over to another authority – Action to cancel the tender, if amenable to writ jurisdiction and whether was arbitrary and influenced by extraneous considerations: Held: The tender was not terminated pursuant to any terms of the contract subsisting between the parties – Respondent cancelled the tender saying that there was technical fault in the tender that was floated – Thus, the respondent exercised powers in its executive capacity as the action to cancel the tender fell outside the purview of the terms of the contract – Hence, the present matter is not purely a contractual dispute even if related to a tender, as the dispute involves a public law element – Although there is no discharge of a public function by the respondent * Author [2024] 7 S.C.R. 533 Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors. towards the appellant yet there is a right to public law action vested in him against the respondent in terms of Article 14 – Thus, writ petition filed by the respondent was maintainable and the relief prayed for could have been considered by the High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction – On facts, just a month prior to cancelling the tender, the respondent issued work stop notice to the appellant, asking to stop all work in respect of the tender in view of the handing over of the operation & maintenance of the concerned underpasses by the respondent to another authority, Kolkata Municipal Corporation – Appellant pointed out that the work stop s were misconceived as the respondent continued to retain the custody as well as the advertisement rights of the concerned underpasses – As such the respondent even after the change in policy, remained well within its rights to continue charging license fee in lieu of the advertisement rights by way of the tender issued to the appellant – Change in policy had no bearing on the cancellation of the tender – It was only after the appellant highlighted why the work stop s were misconceived and uncalled for, that the respondent immediately flipped its stance and in its notice of cancellation that was issued just 1-month later, it attributed ‘technical faults’ in the tender – Furthermore, although the internal-file notings mention about the policy change in the operation and maintenance of the concerned underpasses, however, the cancellation of the tender for work was neither due to any technical fault nor due to the policy change but it was at the behest of the concerned minister who suggested to cancel the tender – The concerned minister’s decision to cancel the tender on account of purported ‘change in policy’ was without any application of mind, capricious and influenced by malice – Cancellation of the tender was not in public interest – Present lis is a classic case of an arbitrary and capricious exercise of powers by the respondent to cancel the tender on the basis of extraneous considerations and at the behest of the concerned Minister-In-Charge – Notice of cancellation was non-est, quashed – Impugned of the High Court upholding the decision of the respondent to cancel the tender, set aside.
