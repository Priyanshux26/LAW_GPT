1 of 2012.140 Unlike the decisions discussed above, this was not a case where the protection of Article 31-C was sought to protect a legislation, instead, Article 39(b) was relied on by this Court to determine whether there is a 137 [1989] 2 SCR 544 : (1989) 3 SCC 709 : 1989 INSC 128 138 [1989] 2 SCR 518 : (1989) 3 SCC 616 : 1989 INSC 127 139 [1990] 1 SCR 983 : (1992) Supp 1 SCC 692 : 1990 INSC 89 140 [2012] 9 SCR 311 : (2012) 10 SCC 1 : 2012 INSC 428 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 167 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. constitutional mandate for the distribution of natural resources in a particular way. In view of the observations of a two-judge bench of this Court on the allocation of spectrum, the President made a reference to this Court. One of the main questions before this Court was whether auctions are the only constitutionally permissible means for the state to dispose of natural resources. 198. The Constitution Bench held that declaring auctions as a constitutional mandate would be impermissible as it would distort the constitutional principles in Article 39(b). This Court held that Article 39(b) lays down a ‘restriction’ on the object of distribution of natural resources, i.e. that such distribution must be to achieve the “common good”. Further, the term “distribution” was held to have a wide connotation, not restricted to only one mode of allocation such as auctions. This Court held: “113. […] The overarching and underlying principle governing “distribution” is furtherance of common good. But for the achievement of that objective, the Constitution uses the generic word “distribution”. Distribution has broad contours and cannot be limited to meaning only one method i.e. auction. It envisages all such methods available for distribution/allocation of natural resources which ultimately subserve the “common good”. 199. Further, this Court held that although auctions may be the best way to maximise revenue, revenue maximisation is not always the best way to subserve the ‘common good’. In some cases, according to this Court, revenue considerations may assume a secondary position vis-à-vis developmental considerations. This Court held: “119. The norm of “common good” has to be understood and appreciated in a holistic manner. It is obvious that the manner in which the common good is best subserved is not a matter that can be measured by any constitutional yardstick—it would depend on the economic and political philosophy of the Government. Revenue maximisation is not the only way in which the common good can be subserved. Where revenue maximisation is the object of a policy, being considered qua that resource at that point of time to be the best way to subserve the common good, auction would be one of the preferable methods, though 168 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports not the only method. Where revenue maximisation is not the object of a policy of distribution, the question of auction would not arise. Revenue considerations may assume secondary consideration to developmental considerations.
