If the presence of Rani Kaur in the house on the date of the alleged incident is doubtful, then, the testimony of PW 5 that he had seen her along with the appellant in the jeep, will also lose its strength. 37. Seen in this background, we need not go further and consider the evidence qua other circumstances sought to be proved by the prosecution since the failure to prove a single circumstance cogently can cause a snap in the chain of circumstances. There cannot be a gap in the chain of circumstances. When the conviction is to be based on circumstantial evidence solely, then there should not be any snap in the chain of circumstances. If there is a snap in the chain, the accused is entitled to benefit of doubt. If some of the circumstances in the chain can be explained by any other reasonable hypothesis, then also the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt. [See: Bhimsingh Vs. State of Uttarakhand, (2015) 4 SCC 281.] 38. Therefore, we allow this appeal and set aside the concurrent findings of conviction. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeal allowed.
