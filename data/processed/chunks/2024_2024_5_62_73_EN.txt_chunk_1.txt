Acceptance of Change Reports in relation to the Vahiwatdar (Administrator) and Trustees of Shri Mallikarjun Devasthan, Shelgi, a Public Trust, is in issue. A learned Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay invalidated such acceptance and remanded the matters to the Deputy Charity Commissioner, Solapur Region, Solapur, for consideration afresh. Hence, these appeals. 3. Though, no interim s were passed by this Court, we are informed that the s of remand have not been acted upon owing to the pendency of these cases. Further, in terms of the High Court’s directions, the Vahiwatdar and the Trustees, whose names were already entered in the records, are continuing to administer the Trust as on date. 4. Facts, to the extent relevant, played out thus: By application dated 26.05.1952, Mallikarjun Mahalingappa Patil applied for registration of Shri Mallikarjun Devasthan, Shelgi, as a Public Trust, under Section 18 of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950, now known as Maharashtra Public Trusts Act, 1950 (for brevity, ‘the Act of 1950’). The object of this Trust was the upkeep and maintenance of Shri Mallikarjun Temple [2024] 5 S.C.R. 65 Shri Mallikarjun Devasthan, Shelgi v. Subhash Mallikarjun Birajdar & Ors. at Shelgi, North Solapur Taluka. Shri Mallikarjun Devasthan, Shelgi, was accordingly registered as a Public Trust. The mode of succession of managership and trusteeship, as provided in the application, was that Mallikarjun Mahalingappa Patil was to be the Vahiwatdar of the Trust and the eldest male member of his family was to succeed him. Further, the Vahiwatdar was also empowered to co-opt others, if and when necessary. Mallikarjun Mahalingappa Patil passed away in the year 1992 and his eldest son, Ashok Mallikarjun Patil, became the Vahiwatdar of the Trust.
