That apart, accused has failed to explain with regard to the incriminating evidence found against him except total denial and as such the High Court has rightly applied the principles laid down by this Court in Pattu Rajan v. State of Tamil Nadu9 to reject the contention of the accused appellant. C On account of evidence available on record having been ignored and there being patent perversity in appreciation of evidence by the Learned Sessions Judge it resulted in interference by the High Court. We do not find any material irregularly having crept in the of the High Court calling for our interference. On re-appreciation of entire evidence D by the High Court inproper perspective it has resulted in arriving at a right conclusion viz. that accused alone has committed the murder of the deceased Mr. Jose C Kafan and there being no other possible view which could be considered as missing in the link of chain of circumstances, this Court is of the considered view that appeal deserves to be dismissed as being devoid of merits. E 23. For the reasons indicated hereinabove we dismiss the appeal and confirm the dated 20.03.2020 passed by the High Court of Karnataka in Criminal Appeal No.335 of 2014. F Nidhi Jain Appeal dismissed. (Assisted by : Rakhi, LCRA) G 8 (2015)1 SCC 323 9 (2019) 4 SCC 771 H
