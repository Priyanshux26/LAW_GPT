1 State on 06.11.2013, as amended on 03.05.2016. Having examined the matter in its totality, we are clearly of the view E that answer to this question could only be in the negative for more than one reason. 15. A comprehension of the factual aspects and the rival submissions makes it clear that the entire case of the petitioner-company, asserting its right to get the subject land converted from leasehold to F freehold, is premised on the policy formulated by the respondent No. 1 on 06.11.2013 and amended on 03.05.2016. The petitioner would assume that the said policy with its amendment is applicable to its project and to the subject land. This assumption is without any legal basis and the claim of the petitioner turns out to be hollow and baseless because neither the original policy formulated on 06.11.2013 nor its amendment on 03.05.2016 G have any application to the subject land or to the project of the petitioner. 15.1. A look at the background aspects makes it clear that the subject land was allotted to the petitioner on 05.08.2006 after acceptance of its offer of allotment of the said industrial plot by UPSIDC. Clause 14(a) of the allotment letter dated 05.08.2006 had been clear and H BHASIN INFOTECH AND INFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATE LTD. 1089 v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] unequivocal that land was allotted on 90 years lease basis. Further, it A was provided in clause 10(b) of the allotment letter that tripartite lease deed of the built-up premises would be executed where the allottee of the developer shall be the lessee; UPSIDC shall be the lessor; and the developer (the petitioner) shall be a confirming party. The lease deed dated 23.08.2006 in relation to 37208 sq. mtrs. of the allotted land carried B the covenants, inter alia, that the lessee (the petitioner) will not, without the consent of lessor (UPSIDC), transfer, sublet, relinquish, mortgage or assign its interest in the demised premises or in the buildings standing thereon with the other requirements [vide clause 3 (j)]. It was also stipulated that the allottee shall have to abide by the general terms and conditions of allotment of UPSIDC [vide clause 13]. It appears that in C this lease deed dated 23.08.2006, the stipulation regarding tripartite lease deed did not as such occur but the said clause 13 made all the general conditions of allotment binding on the petitioner. Moreover, in the other lease deed dated 30.03.2009 in relation to the adjacent plot of land, this stipulation was also inserted in clause 3(j). We are not entering into the D questions relating to tripartite lease deed in this matter but, this much is apparent on a comprehensive look at the terms of allotment and the covenants of lease deeds that the land was allotted to the petitioner on 90 years lease basis and further treatment of land and built-up portion thereupon were to abide by those terms and covenants. It is also clear that possession of the entire parcel of land comprising the aforesaid two E lease deeds, i.e., 40505 sq.
