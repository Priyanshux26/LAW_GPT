1 SCR 524 : (1976) 3 SCC 252 60 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports against Shri Yogendra Garg for sanction under Section 197 of the CrPC 1973, and henceforth, the Appellant-Company cannot be prosecuted alone for the charge under Section 120B of IPC 1860, and it finally put forth that the offences under Section 420 read with Section 120B of IPC 1860 are not made out as against the Appellant. 13. The learned Special Judge, however, disagreed Company and dismissed the said application vide dated 19.07.2017. To substantiate its dismissal, the Court with reference to the CE Act 1944, observed that as per Section 4A(1), it transpires that the retail price of the concerned goods is to be declared, which through reliance on Circular dated 01.03.2001 and the concerned provisions of law, is interpreted as declaration of MRP. 14. It is against the said dated 19.07.2017 that the Appellant- Company had moved the High Court of Gujarat in CRA No. 783 of 2017 which eventually led to the passing of the Impugned dated 15.09.2023. During the pendency of the CRA No. 783 of 2017, the High Court of Gujarat stayed further proceedings before the Special Judge while issuing notice to the Respondent-Agency vide dated 18.08.2017. It was brought to the attention of the High Court that the Appellant-Company had paid a total of INR 1,51,45,378/- (Rupees One Crore Fifty One Lakhs Forty Five Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy Eight only) during the investigation by the Revenue Authorities and admittedly, in light of the s dated 09.05.2005 and 30.06.2005, the Appellant-Company had become entitled to a refund instead. 15. While passing the Impugned dated 15.09.2023, the High Court of Gujarat disagreed with the contentions of the Appellant-Company, and affirmed the contentions of the Respondent-Agency. 16. It is in this backdrop that the Appellant-Company moved this Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 13422 of 2023 by reiterating its earlier contentions. On the first date of hearing, our attention was drawn to the dated 09.05.2005 of the Office of Commissioner of Customs (Appeals) which had directed that the matter be remanded to the assessing authority for fresh assessment. No further development is there in the case of the Appellant-Company. Accordingly, vide dated 16.10.2023, proceedings before the Trial Court were stayed. The Respondent-Agency, too, filed their contentions as part of its Counter Affidavit dated 19.04.2024. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 61 Baccarose Perfumes and Beauty Products Pvt. Ltd v. Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr. 17. Having heard the counsels for both the parties at length, it is pertinent to consider the concerned provisions of law before we delve into the legal and factual facet. 18. Predominantly, the argument of the Appellant-Company pertained to having been granted immunity by Settlement Commission vide dated 20.08.2007 as per Section 32K of the CE Act 1944. A perusal of the powers of the Settlement Commission leads us to equivalent provision under the CA 1962 through Section 127H. Both the provisions are pari materia to each other and bear the same text.
