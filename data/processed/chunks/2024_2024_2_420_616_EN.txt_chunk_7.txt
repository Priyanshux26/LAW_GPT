[Paras 29, 31-33, 35] Doctrines/Principles — Doctrine of proportionality - Proportionality standard test to balance fundamental rights- right to information and the right to informational privacy: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CuI.) (for himself and for B R Gavai, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, JJ) Proportionality standard is an effective standard to test whether the infringement of the fundamental right is justified — It would prove to be ineffective when the State’s interest in question is also a reflection of a fundamental right — Proportionality standard is by nature curated to give prominence to the fundamental right and minimize the restriction on it— If the single proportionality standard were employed to the considerations in the instant case, at the suitability prong, the Court would determine if non-disclosure is a suitable means for furthering the right to privacy — At the necessity stage, the Court would determine if non-disclosure is the least restrictive means to give effect to the right to privacy — At the balancing stage, the Court would determine if non-disclosure has a disproportionate effect on the right holder — In this analysis, the necessity and the suitability prongs would inevitably be satisfied because the purpose is substantial: it is a fundamental right — Balancing stage will only account for the disproportionate impact of the measure on the right to information (the right) and not the right to privacy (the purpose) since the Court is required to balance the impact on the right with the fulfillment of the purpose through the selected means — Thus, the Court while applying the proportionality standard to resolve the conflict between two fundamental rights preferentially frames the standard to give prominence to the fundamental right which is alleged to be violated by the petitioners (in this case, the right to information). [Paras 152-153] 430 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Doctrines/Principles — Double proportionality standard - Application of, to both the rights-right to informational privacy of the contributor and the right to information of the voter: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya ४ Chandrachud, CuI.) (for himself and for B R Gavai, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, JJ) Double proportionality standard is the proportionality standard to both the rights (as purpose) to determine if the means used are suitable, necessary and proportionate to the fundamental rights — First prong of the analysis is whether the means has a rational connection with both the purposes, that is, informational privacy of the political contributions and disclosure of information to the voter — Further, while applying the suitability prong to the purpose of privacy of political contribution, the court must consider whether the non- disclosure of information to the voter and its disclosure only when demanded by a competent court and upon the registration of criminal case has a rational nexus with the purpose of achieving privacy of political contribution — Undoubtedly, the measure by prescribing non-disclosure of information about political funding shares a nexus with the purpose — Non-disclosure of information grants anonymity to the contributor, thereby protecting information privacy — It is certainly one of the ways capable of realizing the purpose of informational privacy of political affiliation — Suitability prong must next be applied to the purpose of disclosure of information about political contributions to voters — There is no nexus between the balancing measure adopted with the purpose of disclosure of information to the voter — According to Clause 7(4) of the Electoral Bond Scheme and the amendments, the information about contributions made through the Electoral Bond Scheme is exempted from disclosure requirements — This information is never disclosed to the voter — Purpose of securing information about political funding can never be fulfilled by absolute non-disclosure — Measure adopted does not satisfy the suitability prong vis-a-vis the purpose of information of political funding - The next stage is the necessity prong, wherein the Court determines if the measure identified is the least restrictive and equally effective measure — Court must determine if there are other possible means which could have been adopted to fulfill the purpose, and whether such alternative means realize the purpose in a real and substantial manner; impact fundamental rights differently; and are better suited on an overall comparison of the degree of realizing the purpose [2024] 2 S.C.R.
