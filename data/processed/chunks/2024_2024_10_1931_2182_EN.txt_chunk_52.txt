The State Legislature will have the competence to legislate with respect to the field which is not the subject matter of control. The legislative competence of the State Legislature is only denuded to the extent of the ‘control’ by the Union declared by the law of Parliament to be expedient in the public interest. 2000 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports c. Reconciling the potential overlap between Entry 52 of List I and Entry 8 of List II 66. Having discerned the scope of Entry 52 of List I, it next needs to be considered if Entry 52 of List I and Entry 8 of List II overlap, and if they overlap, whether they can be reconciled. 67. At this juncture, the decisions of this Court that have dealt with the interplay of Entry 52 of List I and entries of List II need to be referred to. In Calcutta Gas Company v. State of West Bengal,118 a Constitution Bench dealt with the overlap between Entry 52 of List I and Entry 25 of List II. Entry 25 of List II provides for ‘gas and gas works’. The Legislature of West Bengal enacted the Oriental Gas Company Act 1960. The constitutional validity of the enactment was challenged on the ground that Entry 24 of List II which deals with industries is subject to Entry 52 of List I and thus, Entry 25 of List II must be confined to matters which are not covered by Entry 24. In short, the submission was that the ‘industry’ of gas and gas works will be covered by Entry 24 of List II and the other matters relating to gas and gas works will be covered by Entry 25 of List II. Justice Subba Rao writing for the Constitution Bench held that the ‘industry’ of gas and gas works will be covered by Entry 25 for the following reasons119: a. Entry 25 of List II will become redundant if Entry 24 of List II (read along with Entries 25 and 26 which deal with trade, commerce, production, supply and distribution of products) covers the industry of ‘gas and gas works’; b. The alternative, allows Entries 24 and 25 to operate fully in their respective fields. Entry 24 must be interpreted to cover the entire field of industry while Entry 25, the specific industry of gas and gas works;120 and 118 [1962] Supp. 3 SCR 1 : AIR 1962 SC 1044 119 AIR 1962 SC 1044 [9] 120 “9. […] If industry in Entry 24 is interpreted to include gas and gas works, Entry 25 may become redundant, and in the context of the succeeding entries, namely Entry 26, dealing with trade and commerce, and Entry 27, dealing with production, supply and distribution of goods it will be deprived of all its contents and reduced to “useless lumber”. If industrial, trade, production and supply aspect are taken out of Entry 25, the substratum of the said entry would disappear: in that event we would be attributing to the authors of the Constitution ineptitude, want of precision and tautology.
