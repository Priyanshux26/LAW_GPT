A valid but as per the “form” of arbitration agreement provided in Section 7 of Arbitration Act, 1996, it has to necessarily be in writing. Another point worth noting is that if an arbitration agreement can be for example, even non-contractual and does not necessarily require signature, how far the general provisions of Stamp Act, 1899 and the Contract Act, 1872 can apply to prove “formal” validity of an arbitration agreement B produced under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act, 1996? Section 2(h) of the Contract Act, 1872 states that an agreement enforceable by law is a contract but a plain reading of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 may also prove that an “arbitration agreement” can be non- contractual. This is not to say that the provisions of the Contract Act, C 1872 or Stamp Act, 1899 would not apply. As rightly held in Vidya Drolia(supra) and noted by my Learned Brother Justice K.M. Joseph, pre-conditions to formation of contract under the Contract Act, 1872 must be met which includes free consent of the parties, absence of fraud and misrepresentation etc. However, in my view, in this reference, we are concerned with a formal requirement. The point being that when D a special law provides for the specific requirements for the “formal” validity of an arbitration agreement, it cannot be rendered void by a general law. An Arbitration agreement has special attributes59 and is not a conventional agreement in that sense. Moreover, none of the provisions of the Stamp Act, 1899 would lead us to the conclusion that an arbitration E agreement would be invalid/void-ab-initio when it is not stamped. Thus, the conclusion in Garware(supra) that an unstamped agreement would be rendered void is not only inconsistent with Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 but also the Stamp Act, 1899 as per which a document can at most, be rendered inadmissible in evidence.
