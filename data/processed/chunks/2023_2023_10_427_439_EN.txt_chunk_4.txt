19555 (W) of 1999. The learned counsel also placed on record the memo of the Chairman of Respondent No. 3- Municipality dated 15.09.2006, proposing the regularisation of 12 persons including the Appellant. The High Court in its dated 03.09.2010 passed in Writ Petition No. 17892 of 2010 has also recorded submissions of the Respondents that resolutions for F the Appellant’s absorption are already in place and the same have been sent for approval. 16. The learned counsel then argued that the High Court ought to have looked that the facts of the present case are clearly distinguishable from the facts of Secretary, State of Karnataka vs Umadevi1, since it G cannot be applied to a case where regularisation has been sought in pursuance of Article 14. In support of her argument, the learned counsel relied on this Court’s in UP SEB vs Pooran Chandra Pandey2, the facts of which are similar to the present case. In the said case, it 1 (2006) 4 SCC 1 H 2 (2007) 11 SCC 92 OM PRAKASH BANERJEE v. THE STATE OF WEST BENGAL 433 & ORS. [KRISHNA MURARI, J.] was held that the decision in Umadevi (supra) cannot be applied A mechanically without seeing the facts of a particular case, as a little difference in facts can make Umadevi (supra) inapplicable. Lastly, the learned counsel mentioned that the Appellant retired in 2021 (after a service of 30 years) without any benefits. 17. Per contra, Ms. Astha Sharma, AOR, learned counsel appearing B on behalf of Respondents No. 1 and 2 argued that the High Court has rightly dismissed Writ Petition No. 31399 (W) of 2017, as the same was filed by the Appellant after an inordinate delay of 5 years, and the representations made by the Appellant do not constitute a sufficient ground to condone the delay. In this regard, the learned counsel relied on C this Court’s in Surjeet Singh Sahni vs State of U.P. & Ors.3, wherein it has been held that representation does not extend the period of limitation and the aggrieved person has to approach the court expeditiously and within reasonable time. 18. The learned counsel brought to our notice the High Court’s D dated 24.08.2009, passed in Writ Petition ST No. 483 of 2009. In the said , the High Court declared regularisation circulars dated 13.08.1979, 28.08.1980 and 13.03.1996, respectively, as ultra vires to the Constitution. Therefore, the said circulars have seized to exist in the eyes of law. The learned counsel also contended that the High Court in its dated 20.06.2000 passed in Writ Petition No. 19555 (W) of E 1999, had rightly held that the absorption of permanent vacancies of casual workers would not be considered retrospectively and would only have a prospective effect. She further contended that the Appellant failed to produce documents before the High Court to substantiate if the dated 04.05.2018 passed in Writ Petition No. 31399 (W) of 2017 suffers F from any perversity. 19. Learned counsel placed reliance on this Court’s in Umadevi (supra) wherein it has been held that casual/temporary/ad hoc appointees are not entitled to regularisation.
