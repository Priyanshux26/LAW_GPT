Aggrieved by the aforesaid and decree of the High Court, the defendant No.7 (Srinivas Raghavendrarao Desai) filed two Special Leave Petitions. Leave was granted. As he expired during the pendency of the matters before this Court, his legal representatives have been brought on record. The issue raised in the present appeals is only pertaining to Regular Survey No. 44/4 and Regular Survey No.106/2, which was sold to defendant No.9 by defendant No.7 vide sale deed dated 25.07.2001. Arguments 7. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the of the High Court deserves to be set side for the reason that reliance has been placed upon 1965 partition which was not the pleaded case in the plaint initially filed. No evidence led, which was beyond pleadings could be considered. An application seeking amendment of the plaint was filed to take up that plea, however, the same was declined by the Trial Court vide dated 11.10.2006 and the was not challenged any further. Even the pleadings to that effect sought to be taken in the replication filed by the plaintiffs were struck off by the Trial Court. The pleaded case of the defendants before the Trial Court was that there was a partition amongst the family members on 30.08.1984. The aforesaid partition deed was subject matter of litigation in Civil Suit No. 80 of 1995 filed by the defendant No. 2 wherein the same has been noticed and an passed thereon. 7.1 The High Court had totally gone wrong in setting aside the decree dated 23.06.1995 without there being any challenge to the same by any of the parties. That issue did not arise out of the of the lower Appellate Court. It was further submitted that the appellant/defendant No. 7 had not violated any interim passed by the Trial Court as on the date such an was passed, he was not even party to the litigation.
