The amendment is intended to meet the criticism over the timeline in its application to international commercial arbitrations. The amendment is remedial H TATA SONS PVT LTD (FORMERLY TATA SONS LTD) v. SIVA INDUSTRIES 1271 AND HOLDINGS LTD in that it carves out international commercial arbitrations from A the rigour of the timeline of six months. This lies within the domain of the arbitrator and is outside the purview of judicial intervention. The removal of the mandatory time limit for making an arbitral award in the case of an international commercial arbitration does not confer any rights or liabilities on any party. Since Section B 29A(1), as amended, is remedial in nature, it should be applicable to all pending arbitral proceedings as on the effective date i.e., 30 August 2019. [Para 34][1284-B-E] 1.5 Consistent with the amended provisions of Section 29A, the sole arbitrator in the instant case, would be acting within his C domain and jurisdiction to decide upon any further extension of time beyond what is originally stipulated at the meeting which was held on 21 March 2018. The sole arbitrator may issue appropriate procedural directions for extension of time while at the same time endeavoring an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration.
