Further to the JVA, a Technology and Know-How Licence Agreement (dated 13.07.1999) was entered into by AgrEvo SA and MIL. In terms of this licence agreement, the necessary process and know-how to manufacture H 1 Dated 23.04.2010 in No. 330-337/WZD/AHB/20210 M/S BILAG INDUSTRIES P. LTD. v. COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. 621 DAMAN [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] Esbiothrin and Esbiol as per the specifications provided by AgrEvo SA A was transferred to BIL. In terms of this agreement, AgrEvo SA had agreed to licence BIL to manufacture the allethrin molecules (i.e., Esbiothrin and Esbiol products) conforming to AgrEvo SA’s specifications. Thus, as a JV partner, AgrEvo SA invested a certain amount as capital in BIL and also brought the technical know-how for B the Joint Venture Company (BIL) to manufacture Esbiothrin and Esbiol products. In terms of the JVA, it was agreed that three members of the Bilakhias family (who were directors of MIL), were to be paid non- compete fee of ` 25.51 crores as conforming parties to the JVA. This non-compete fee bound the Bilakhias to not compete with the JVA after it came into force, i.e., from 03.07.1999. C 5. BIL had been selling its manufactured products to various bulk formulators including Rhone Poulenc Agro Chemicals India Ltd./ Aventis CropScience (India) Ltd. The Esbiothrin purchased from BIL had been sold by Aventis CropScience (India) Ltd., to various end-consumers. Other products purchased from BIL were used by Aventis CropScience D (India) Ltd., for formulation. The price at which the goods manufactured by BIL and sold to AgrEvo SA on export was based on supply agreement dated 03.07.1999. According to the supply agreement, BIL agreed to sell deltamethrin product at a particular price for different periods from April 1999 to March 2003. The price was to be arrived at on the basis of E actual cost of production plus profit margin as mentioned in the table in Annexure 3.1(a) of the supply agreement dated 03.07.1999. Similarly, the allethrin products (Esbiothrin) were also agreed to be sold by BIL to AgrEvo SA at the actual cost plus mark up of 35% in 1999-2000, 30% in 2000-2001 and 25% in 2002-2003. Esbiothrin products were sold by AgrEvo SA outside India. BIL arrived at the price in the same manner F for its sale to AgrEvo (India) Ltd. / Aventis CropScience (India) Ltd. within India. Certain changes in share holding patterns of foreign companies occurred later; however, they are not relevant for the purposes of deciding this case. 6. What is relevant for this case is that in BIL, AgrEvo SA held G 51% of the share capital initially (which was increased to 74% subsequently) and it continued to hold more than 51%. BIL thus became a subsidiary of AgrEvo SA. AgrEvo SA held 100% shares in Aventis Crop Science (India) Ltd. Therefore, both BIL and Aventis Crop Science (India) Ltd. became subsidiaries of AgrEvo SA (the name of which was H 622 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A changed to Aventis CropScience SA around March 2000; both names are used interchangeably hereafter) during the relevant period.
