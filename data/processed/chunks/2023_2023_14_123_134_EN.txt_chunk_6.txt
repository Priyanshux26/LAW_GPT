However, it is also settled principle of law that, this Court being a Executing Court cannot go behind the decree and has to execute the decree as it is. It needs to be mentioned at the cost of repetition that, already the Misc. Notice no. 152 of 2006 is decided by my learned predecessor by way of dt. 12.02.2013. The said notice was contested by the 132 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. debtor no. 1(a) to 1(e) and debtor no. 2. It was held that the present decree holder is entitled to execute the decree against the debtors. It needs to be mentioned that, the said is not challenged by the debtor no. 1(a) to 1(e) and debtor no. 2 before the appropriate forum. If the said fact is taken into consideration, indeed there is considerable substance in the argument of the learned Advocate for the decree holder that, the said dt. 12.02.2013 has attained fi nality and now it is open to the debtor no. 1(a) to 1(e) and debtor no. 2 to agitate the same point again under the pretext of objection to the execution of decree. 9. That apart, what is most important is that this Court is not sitting in appeal against its own . Also, it is not the case of the debtor no. 1(a) to 1(e) and debtor no. 2, that the dated 12.02.2013 passed by my learned predecessor in Misc. Notice no. 152 of 2006 was passed without jurisdiction. Also, the ground of fraud or ex-parte passing the dt 12.02.2013 is not raised by the debtor no. 1(a) to 1(e) and debtor no. 2 in the application Exh. 18. The Misc. Notice No. 152 of 2006 was decided on merits after due hearing both sides and the said is not challenged before the appropriate appellate/revisional forum. If the said fact is considered, there can be hardly any doubt that the application Exh. 18 taken out by the debtor no. 1(a) to 1(e) and debtor no. 2 is nothing but an attempt to re-open the passed on 12.02.2013 in Misc. Notice no .152 of 2006 under the garb of objection to the execution of decree which is not permissible particularly when already the said notice is decided on merit and is not challenged till date. Considering the said fact, I have no hesitation to hold that, the application Exh. 18 is not maintainable.” As we have already referred above, this was taken in revision by the debtors, where the revision was allowed and the dated 28.09.2017 was set aside. The decree holder moved a petition before the Bombay High Court under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India and the main ground taken before the High Court was that the revisional court fell into an error in holding that the application moved by the debtors for setting aside the dated 12.02.2013 comes within the purview of PRADEEP MEHRA v. HARIJIVAN J. JETHWA (SINCE 133 DECEASED THR. LRS.) [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] the power of the executing court given to it under Section 47 of the CPC.
