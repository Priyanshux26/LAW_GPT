36. Insofar as Mr. Singh’s submissions that this Court may not exclude from the NCLT’s ambit any power to direct re-valuation, we have given our anxious thought to the same. Our view is that while certainty in law and legal principles is the obvious aim, the law is to be applied in the context 15 Raj Kishore Jha v State of Bihar, (2003) 11 SCC 519. 694 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. of the facts. If a matter where the facts are stark comes to light, the same would have to necessarily be dealt with by the NCLT within the four corners of the Code itself, having due regard to the extant circumstances. It is for the NCLT to exercise power strictly within the domain permitted by the Code. In this behalf, one may peruse the decisions in Embassy Property Developments Private Limited v State of Karnataka, (2020) 13 SCC 308 and Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limit ed v Amit Gupta, (2021) 7 SCC 209.
