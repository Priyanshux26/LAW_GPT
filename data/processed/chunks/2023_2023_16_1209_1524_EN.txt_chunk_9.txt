[Para 149] – Held (per Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J. ): One is not oblivious to the concerns of the LGBTQ+ partners with respect to denial of access to certain benefi ts and privileges that are otherwise available only to married couples – The general statutory scheme for the fl ow of benefi ts gratuitous or earned; property or compensation; leave or compassionate appointment, proceed on a certain defi nitional understanding of partner, dependant, caregiver, and family – In that defi nitional understanding, it is no doubt true, that certain classes of individuals, same-sex partners, live-in relationships and non-intimate care givers including siblings are left out – The impact of some of these defi nitions is iniquitous and in some cases discriminatory – The policy considerations and legislative frameworks underlying these defi nitional contexts are too diverse to be captured and evaluated within a singular judicial proceeding – A review of the impact of legislative framework on the fl ow of such benefi ts requires a deliberative and consultative exercise, which exercise the legislature and executive are constitutionally suited, and tasked, to undertake.
