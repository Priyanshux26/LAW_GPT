86. Thus, it is the decision-making process, which vitiated the entire process of reappointment of the respondent No. 4 as the Vice-Chancellor. The case on hand is not one of mere irregularity. 87. We emphasise on the decision-making process because in such a case the exercise of power is amenable to judicial review. 88. In Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans reported in (1982) 1 WLR 1155 : (1982) 3 All ER 141 (HL), Lord Brightman observed thus: (WLR p. 1174 G) “… Judicial review, as the words imply, is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was made.” 89. In view of the aforesaid, we allow this appeal. 90. The impugned and passed by the High Court dated 23.02.2022 is hereby set aside. As a consequence, the Notifi cation dated 23.11.2021, reappointing the respondent No. 4 as the Vice-Chancellor of the Kannur University is hereby quashed. 91. Pending application(s) if any shall stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Ankit Gyan
