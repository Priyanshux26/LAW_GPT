The Union of India and Others the applicants therein(private respondents herein) to file a review application for assailing the s passed in Original Application No. 831 of 2007 and Original Application No. 821 of 2007. 10.

The Union of India13 and respondent No. 2-Factory were directed by the High Court to restore the seniority of the writ petitioners(private respondents herein), holding that the writ petitioners are senior to the appellant herein, both as per the date of initial appointment and also in the promotional post of skilled grade. The High Court held that an employee selected in the semi-skilled grade is required to complete the probation period satisfactorily and has to pass the requisite trade test prescribed for the post before he can be confirmed and promoted to the skilled grade. Due to the extension of the probation period of the respondents in the Writ Petition No.583 of 2011(including the appellant herein), they were required to be placed below the persons who were promoted to the skilled grade earlier to them. The High Court held that in the skilled grade, the writ petitioners(private respondents herein) were senior to the third respondent(appellant herein). It was also held that the promotions to the skilled grade and the highly skilled grade were carried out in the years 1998 and 2003, respectively but the third respondent (appellant herein) chose to file the Original Application14 in the year 2007 and no reason was forthcoming for the gross delay. The relevant extract from the High Court’s dated 10th October, 2011 is reproduced hereinbelow: - “7. A mere reading of the counter affidavit would show that the probation of the third respondent in W.P. No. 583 of 2011 was extended by six months and for the third respondent in W.P. No. 584 of 2011, it was extended by three months by virtue of their failure to complete probation of two years and to pass the required trade test prescribed for the posts.
