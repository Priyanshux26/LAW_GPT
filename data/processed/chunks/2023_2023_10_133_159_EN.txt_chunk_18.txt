The certificate dated 04.05.2020 issued by the APPCB merely certified that the installed capacity of Sanvira, as G on 09.10.2018, for manufacturing calcined petroleum coke, was 3,30,000 Metric Tonnes per annum in terms of the CTO. The total figure of 1.4 Million Metric Tonnes of RPC was based on the permissible capacity as on 09.10.2018. The Division Bench, therefore, concluded that if production capacity had increased, the proportionate share to be given was after clearance by this court. H M/S. SANVIRA INDUSTRIES v. RAIN CII CARBON (VIZAG) 159 LTD. & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 29. This court is of the considered opinion that the view expressed A by the impugned is correct. Barring the fact that a clarification was issued on 04.05.2020, by the APPCB, there was no change in circumstance; the material document to be considered was the CTO, which for the relevant period (i.e. as on 09.10.2018) was 2,00,000 MT per annum, for Sanvira. Even according to it, the claim for enhancement B was made later, and the CTO for the increased capacity was issued on 26.12.2019. In these circumstances, the clarification of APPCB, that as on a particular date, the production capacity was 3,30,000 MTPA was of no consequence, because it was the CTO that was considered all along, in all previous meetings. Therefore, the findings and conclusions of the Division Bench cannot be faulted. C 30. For the above reasons, it is held that there is no infirmity with the findings and conclusions of the Division Bench, in the impugned . The appeals fail, and are, accordingly dismissed, without on costs. D Divya Pandey Appeals dismissed. (Assisted by : Kritika and Roopanshi Virang, LCRAs) E F G H
