10. As is clear from Rule 13 extracted above, the uploading of the certifi cates happens only after the declaration of the results of the Preliminary Examination and before the Main Examination is held. For the Main Examination, a candidate is required to submit an on-line Detailed Application Form–I (DAF-I) along with scanned documents/certifi cates in support of the claim for EWS category within the prescribed time. 11. Any delay in submission of the DAF-I or documents in support beyond the prescribed date was not to be allowed and would lead to cancellation of the candidature. DIVYA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 55 [K. V. VISWANATHAN, J.] 12. What is clear from the above is, before the closing date of application, the candidate has to be in possession of the requisite Certifi cate for the Financial Year 2020-2021 and before the Main Examination, the candidate is expected to upload the Certifi cate. Case of the petitioner: 13. The petitioner claims that she had the EWS Certifi cate for the year 2019-2020 since it was issued to her on 09.10.2020 by the Haryana Government.
