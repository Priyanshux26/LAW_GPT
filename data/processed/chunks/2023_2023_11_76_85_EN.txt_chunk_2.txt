3. While so, there was a major outbreak of a bacterial disease called ‘White Spot Disease’ along the east coast of Andhra Pradesh, which led to mass mortality of prawns in the area, including the appellant’s farm. This led to invocation of the insurance policy by the appellant. However, upon submission of a claim thereunder by the appellant and after two separate surveys were conducted at its own behest, the respondent insurance company repudiated the appellant’s claim in its entirety, under letter dated 15.07.1997. According to the insurance company, there was a breach by the appellant of the policy conditions, inasmuch as records were not maintained properly and accurately; records were not produced at the time of the survey; and whatever records were produced were unsubstantiated. 4. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant instituted Original Petition No. 55 of 1996 before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi [for brevity, ‘the NCDRC’]. The appellant prayed for a sum of `75,98,362/- towards the loss suff ered by it along with interest thereon @ 24% per annum and compensation of `10,00,000/-. By common dated 29.04.2004, the NCDRC disposed of the appellant’s Original Petition No. 55 of 1996 along with Original Petition No. 54 of 1996 fi led against the respondent insurance company by one Mr. V.V. Rama Raju, a similarly situated prawn cultivator from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The NCDRC recorded a clear fi nding therein that the repudiation of the appellant’s claim by the respondent insurance company was unjustifi able. It was noted that insurance coverage was provided after thorough inspection of the appellant’s ponds by the senior offi cers of the insurance company on 25.11.1994, who were fully satisfi ed in all respects, and only thereafter, the policy was issued upon payment of the premium. The NCDRC therefore opined that it was totally unreasonable on the part of the insurance company to allege that the appellant was not maintaining proper records on 2-3.12.1994. Reference was made to the two surveyors’ reports and accepting the salvage value suggested by one of them, the NCDRC held that the appellant was entitled to a sum of `17,64,097/- with interest 80 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. thereon @ 9% per annum from 01.07.1995 till realization. Original Petition No. 54 of 1996 fi led by Mr. V.V. Rama Raju, the other prawn cultivator, was also disposed of on similar lines, awarding him a sum of `24,97,609/- with interest thereon @ 9% per annum. 5. Dissatisfi ed with the common passed by the NCDRC, both the claimants and the insurance company approached this Court, by way of a batch of appeals, viz., Civil Appeal Nos. 5294, 7091, 8051 and 4182 of 2004. By dated 10.11.2009, this Court disposed of the appeals, opining that the NCDRC had not calculated the compensation properly, including the interest to be paid to the claimants. The matter was accordingly remanded to the NCDRC for an expeditious decision in that regard. 6. It is on the strength of this remand that the NCDRC again undertook the exercise of quantifi cation of the amount to be paid to the claimants and the interest to be awarded to them, leading to the impugned presently by the appellant.
