These sections provide for an explicit bar from prosecution on grant of immunity in cases where the proceedings for any offence have been instituted subsequent to the date of receipt of the application seeking such immunity under the relevant law. 19. A perusal of the scheme of the CrPC 1973 allows us to infer that mere registration of FIR cannot be interpreted to mean that it constitutes the initiation of such proceedings. A registration of FIR necessitates an investigation by a competent officer as per the detailed process outlined in Sections 155 to 176. It is only after a Final Report (or as referred in the common parlance, a Challan or a Chargesheet) is submitted as per the compliance of Section 173(2) of CrPC 1973, cognizance for the offence(s) concerned is taken. However, undoubtedly, the Court is not bound by the said report. The cardinal principle that investigation and taking of cognizance operate in parallel channels, without an intermingling, and in different areas was also laid down by this Court in H.N. Rishbud v. State (Delhi Admn.) 4 and further elaborated and reiterated in Abhinandan Jha and Others v. Dinesh Mishra 5 and State of Orissa v. Habibullah Khan.6 20. In Hira Lal Hari Lal Bhagwati v. CBI, New Delhi,7 even though the subject matter of the dispute pertained to Kar Vivad Samadhan Scheme, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as “KVSS 1998”), the observations of this Court came to the rescue of the Assessee- Company therein. As per the said factual matrix, the case of the 4 [1955] 1 SCR 1150 : (1954) 2 SCC 934 5 [1967] 3 SCR 668 : 1967 SCC OnLine SC 107 6 2003 SCC OnLine SC 1411 7 [2003] 3 SCR 1118 : (2003) 5 SCC 257 62 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Assessee-Company therein was settled under the KVSS 1998 on 10.02.1999 by the Designated Authority and as per the terms of the settlement, the Assessee-Company therein withdrew the appeal before this Court on 16.03.1999 and a certificate for full and final settlement was issued on 19.07.1999. Despite that, on 06.01.1999, a case was registered as against the Appellant therein in capacity as the office bearer of the Assessee-Company. It was held by this Court that continuation of such a prosecution would be inconsistent with the intent and provisions of the law. The Appellant therein was also obliged to withdraw the appeal before this Court, which might have had also impacted the merits of the criminal proceedings as against them. 21. The above ratio, as laid down by this Court, would be fully applicable to the case-at-hand, especially when it is not in dispute that the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals), Kandla returned a finding that the Appellant-Company was not required to pay the CVD on the basis of MRP, but as per the invoice value. This is in consonance with the submission of the Appellant-Company. On remand to the Assessing Authority for decision afresh on the liability, it had observed that the Appellant-Company was entitled to a refund of INR 1.39 Crores out of the INR 1,51,45,378/- (Rupees One Crore Fifty One Lakhs Forty Five Thousand and Three Hundred Seventy Eight only) paid by it to the Revenue Authorities as per the demand made earlier for the purpose of clearance of the concerned goods.
