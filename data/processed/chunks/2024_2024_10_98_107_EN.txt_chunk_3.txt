The Division Bench, vide the impugned dated 20.07.2016, opined that the entire selection process need not be disturbed. The Bench observed that the interviews were conducted elaborately over 19 days to determine the suitability of candidates. It further noted that inviting candidates 63 times the number of posts for the interview stage did not constitute an error fatal enough to vitiate the entire selection process. Additionally, it was noted that the criteria for shortlisting candidates to the extent of 3-5 times the number of vacancies was not a rigid or mandatory criterion either. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 103 Sukhmander Singh and Ors Etc. v. The State of Punjab and Ors Etc. 10. It was also noted that the adopted selection criteria did not allocate 50 marks solely for the interview component but instead, consisted of a broad range of evaluative criteria (academic qualifications, knowledge of science practical equipment, rural areas, et cetera) as well. In fact, the interview aspect only consisted of 20 marks, and therefore, was not on the higher side. 11. On the question of awarding 5 marks to candidates belonging to rural areas, both the Single Judge and the learned Division Bench were of the same view that awarding such marks on the basis of the residence of the candidates would be legally impermissible. Such a conclusion was drawn on the basis of the ratio in a Full Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court, Abhishek Rishi v. State of Punjab & Ors., 2013 SCC OnLine P&H 6980. 12. Accordingly, the Division Bench, having acknowledged that the selectees had already worked for about 5-6 years with some of them having become over-aged as well, opined that since the selection process was not mala fide or biased, a fresh list should be compiled by the PSEB. This revised list would necessitate the deduction of the 5 marks previously awarded to candidates for belonging to rural areas, on the basis of which appointments should be made. Discussion & Conclusion 13. Various submissions made by the learned counsels for the parties have been considered. Essentially, the question here is whether the criteria on the basis of which selection was made could be made the legal basis for selection & appointment of Laboratory Attendants or not. 14. Admittedly, the advertisement dated 27.04.2011 indicated that shortlisting of candidates should be done on the basis of merit. However, the of the Chairman of the PSEB dated 11.10.2012 (Annexure P-3) indicates that all candidates obtaining 33.3% marks i.e., meeting the 20 marks’ cut-off benchmark, were declared eligible for the interview. Therefore, no weightage was given for marks contained in the written test. Instead, the selection was made on the basis of the following criteria: “CRITERIA FOR THE SELECTION OF LAB ATTENDANTS (i) Academic qualifications: Matriculation a) 1st Division 05 marks 104 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports b) 2nd Division 03 marks c) 3rd Division 02 marks Supporting Qualifications/Activities: a) Rural Area 05 marks b) Knowledge of Science Practical Instrument 15 marks (ii) Experience: 1 year 01 marks 2 years 02 marks 3 years 03 marks 4 years 04 marks 5 years 05 marks (iii) Interview Marks: 20 Grand Total: (i) + (ii) + (iii) = 50” 15.
