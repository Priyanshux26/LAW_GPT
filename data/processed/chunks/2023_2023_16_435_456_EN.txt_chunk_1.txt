[Paras 11, 12, 26, 27] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973– Explanatory Note No. (2) in the First schedule to Cr.PC; ss.3(1)(c), 12: Held: Expressions ‘Magistrate of the First Class’ and ‘Any Magistrate’ used in the First schedule to Cr.PC, include ‘Chief Judicial Magistrates’ as well – Any contra-construction would lead to a situation denuding the status of ‘trial Court’ to a Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate and in other words, AMANDEEP SINGH SARAN v. STATE OF CHHATTISGARH 437 any such contra-construction would tantamount to a declaration that as per the First Schedule to Cr. PC no off ence is triable by a Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate. [P aras 15, 16] Criminal Law – Object of Penology – Discussed. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.3(1)(c), 29, 31: Held: In the Cr.PC, there is no provision to empower a Court of a Chief Judicial Magistrate or Court of a Magistrate of the fi rst class to pass any sentence not authorized u/s.29 (1) or 29 (2), Cr.PC, as the case may be – s.31, Cr. PC deals with sentence in cases on conviction of several off ences at one trial and needless to say that this provision would not cloth power on a Magistrate to bypass the provision u/s.29(1) or 29(2), Cr.PC in respect of imposing sentence in any given off ence upon conviction of the off ender and, therefore, it is diff erent from s.34 of the old Code, 1898.

[Para 20] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – First Schedule to CrPC, surveyed – Court of competence in the hierarchy of Courts empowered to try a particular off ence where imprisonment for life or imprisonment for 10 years and fi ne is prescribed: Held : Barring very few off ences including s.409, IPC, in all cases, where the off ence concerned is punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for 10 years and fi ne, the First Schedule to Cr. PC provides the Court competent to try such off ences as “Court of Session” – Barring some exceptions, it is essentially the severity of the punishment imposable and severe nature of the off ence that acts as the decisive factor in the matter of fi xing the forum in the hierarchy of Courts, for trying the diff erent off ences.
