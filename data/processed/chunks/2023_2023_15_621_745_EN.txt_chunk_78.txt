The focus on mutual intention refl ects a fundamental diff erence between the Group of Companies doctrine and ‘piercing the veil’ or alter ego. In veil-piercing, the separate legal identities of the parent and subsidiary companies are disregarded or nullifi ed on equity and fairness considerations (such as to prevent fraud). Application of the Group of Companies doctrine does not result in lifting the corporate veil, and is rather based on identifying the mutual intention of the parties.46 27. The doctrine has not been accepted in the same terms across the world. 42 Also see Born (supra) 1561; Bernard Hanotiau, ‘Chapter 14: Group of Companies in International Arbitration’ in Loukas A.

LTD. & ANR. 731 [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J.] 28. In UK, in Peterson Farms Inc v. C&M Farming Ltd,47 the Court rejected the applicability of the doctrine in English law. The separate legal identities of the parent and subsidiary companies is held to be a fundamental legal tenet.48 In the Dallah case, the UK Supreme Court diff ered from the Paris Court of Appeal on enforcing the arbitral award against the Government of Pakistan (non-signatory). Even after applying French law to determine when a non-signatory is a party, based on the material before it, the Court held there was no mutual intention in this case to make the Government of Pakistan a party.49 Similarly, in Kabab-Ji SAL (Lebanon) v. Kout Food Group (Kuwait),50 the UK Supreme Court did not enforce the arbitral award against the non-signatory company as there was no material to show that it was a party as per the terms of the contract. 29. Similarly, Singapore courts have also rejected the applicability of the Group of Companies doctrine by emphasising the fundamental corporate law principle of separate legal identities.51 30. Swiss courts, on the other hand, have allowed for non-signatories to be made party to the arbitration agreement based on their conduct, manifesting implied consent. The Swiss Federal Court has held that an arbitration agreement must itself be in writing as per Article 178 of the Swiss Private International Law Act. However, the question of whether a non- signatory is a party to such written arbitration agreement can be determined by reference to its involvement in the preparation and performance of the contract containing the arbitration clause, which refl ects its intent to be party to such arbitration agreement.52 31. American courts also do not expressly rely on the Group of Companies doctrine to determine whether a non-signatory is a party. Rather, they use principles such as equitable estoppel, assumption, piercing the 47 [2004] EWHC 121 (Comm); Mayor and Commonalty & Citizens of the City of London v.
