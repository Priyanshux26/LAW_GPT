Similar view has been reiterated observing that the suit was not maintainable, if barred by the proviso to Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act. (See also Gian Kaur v. Raghubir Singh [(2011) 4 SCC 567) 57. In view of the above, the law becomes crystal clear that it is not permissible to claim the relief of declaration without seeking consequential relief. 29 1993 Supp (3) SCC 129 30 [2012] 8 SCR 35 : (2012) 8 SCC 148 346 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 58. In the instant case, the suit for declaration of title of ownership had been filed, though Respondent 1-plaintiff was admittedly not in possession of the suit property. Thus, the suit was barred by the provisions of Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act and, therefore, ought to have been dismissed solely on this ground. The High Court though framed a substantial question on this point but for unknown reasons did not consider it proper to decide the same.” 30. In Venkataraja and Ors. v. Vidyane Doureradjaperumal (Dead) thr. LRs (2-Judge Bench)31, the purpose behind Section 34 was elucidated by this Court. It was observed that the purpose behind the inclusion of the proviso is to prevent multiplicity of proceedings. It was further expounded that a mere declaratory decree remains non-executable in most cases. This Court noted that the suit was never amended, even at a later stage to seek the consequential relief and therefore, it was held to be not maintainable. This position of law has been reiterated recently in Akkamma and Ors. v. Vemavathi and Ors. (2-Judge Bench)32. 31. This Court in Executive Officer, Arulmigu Chokkanatha Swamy Koil Trust, Virudhunagar v. Chandran and Others (2-Judge Bench)33 while reversing the High Court decree, observed that because of Section 34 of the SRA, 1963, the plaintiff not being in possession and claiming only declaratory relief, ought to have claimed the relief of recovery of possession. It was held that the Trial Court rightly dismissed the suit on the basis that the plaintiff has filed a suit for a mere declaration without relief for recovery, which is clearly not maintainable. 32. That apart, it is now well settled that the lapse of limitation bars only the remedy but does not extinguish the title. Reference may be made to Section 27 of the Limitation Act. This aspect was overlooked entirely by the High Court in reversing the findings of the Courts below. It was not justified for it to have overlooked the aspect of limitation, particularly when deciding a dispute purely civil in nature. 31 [2013] 5 SCR 814 : (2014) 14 SCC 502 32 [2021] 10 SCR 1187 : 2021 SCC Online SC 1146 33 [2017] 5 SCR 473 : (2017) 3 SCC 702 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 347 Vasantha (Dead) Thr. Lr. v. Rajalakshmi @ Rajam (Dead) Thr.Lrs. 33. Adverting to the facts of the present case, on a perusal of the plaint, it is evident that the plaintiff was aware that the appellant herein was in possession of the suit property and therefore it was incumbent upon him to seek the relief which follows.
