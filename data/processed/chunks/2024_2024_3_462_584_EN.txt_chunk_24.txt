v. Union of India, [2015] 13 SCR 1 : (2016) 5 SCC 1 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 495 Sita Soren v. Union of India This Court has overruled decisions which involve the interpretation of the Constitution despite the fact that they have held the field for long periods of time when they offend the spirit of the Constitution. 34. The of the majority in PV Narasimha Rao (supra) deals with an important question of constitutional interpretation which impacts probity in public life. The decision has been met with notes of discord by various benches of this Court ever since it was delivered in 1998. An occasion has arisen in this case to lay down the law and resolve the dissonance. This is not an instance of this Court lightly transgressing from precedent. In fact, this case is an example of the Court giving due deference to the rule of precedent and refraining from reconsidering the decision in PV Narasimha Rao (supra) until it arose squarely for consideration. 35. The appellant has relied on s of this Court in Shanker Raju v. Union of India22, Shah Faesal v. Union of India23, Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. v. CIT24 and Krishena Kumar v. Union of India25. These s reiterate the proposition that (i) the doctrine of stare decisis promotes certainty and consistency in law; (ii) the Court should not make references to reconsider a prior decision in a cavalier manner; and (iii) a settled position of law should not be disturbed merely because an alternative view is available. However, all these s recognize the power of this Court to reconsider its decisions in certain circumstances – including considerations of “public policy”; “public good” and to “remedy continued injustice”. In the facts which arose in those cases, this Court found that there was no compelling reason to reconsider certain s of this Court. 36. In Shanker Raju (supra), this Court was dealing with the interpretation of the Administrative Tribunals (Amendment) Act, 2006 and the appointment of a judicial member of the Central Administrative Tribunal. The two-judge Bench observed that it was bound by the decision of a bench of larger strength adjudicating a similar issue and could not reconsider the view taken in that decision merely because an alternative view was available. 22 [2011] 2 SCR 1 : (2011) 2 SCC 132 23 [2020] 3 SCR 1115 : (2020) 4 SCC 1 24 [1965] 2 SCR 908 25 [1990] 3 SCR 352 : (1990) 4 SCC 207 496 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 37. In Shah Faesal (supra), a Constitution Bench of this Court was adjudicating on the question of whether the petitions were to be referred to a larger bench of seven judges on the ground that there were purportedly two contradictory decisions by benches of five judges. The Court observed that references to larger benches cannot be made casually or based on minor inconsistencies between two s. In that context, the Court found that the decisions were not irreconcilable with each other nor was one of the decisions per incuriam.
