Then, Monu Gujral (PW-10), another neighbour, took the phone but it was cut. PW-10 then used his own phone to call the kidnapper on the same number and asked to speak to Bobby. When the kidnapper let him do so, PW-10 told PW-1 that it was not Bobby’s voice. Then, the caller said to PW-10 that Bobby had told him that his mother had ₹3 lakh; to send the same right away and the balance ₹20 lakh could be given in 1 month. 6. Om Prakash Yadav pressed upon PW-1 to arrange ₹1 lakh and to withdraw the rest of the ₹20 lakhs from the bank. However, PW-1 could not give ₹1 lakh to Om Prakash Yadav as there were relatives in her house. PW-10 wrote down the mobile number from which the kidnapper had RAJESH & ANR. v. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH 7 [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] called, viz., 8305620342, on a piece of paper and gave it to PW-1. She gave the said number to the police. When she came back from the police station, Om Prakash Yadav came to her and asked her not to tell the police anything and that Bobby would be freed by midnight. Later, Raja Yadav came to PW-1’s house at about 11 o’clock in the night and told her that her brother, PW-2, and her other brother, Major Singh, had kidnapped her son in their greed for money. Raja Yadav had a sword in his hand and told PW-1 that he would cut the throats of her brothers if she asked him to. PW-1 told him not to do any such thing as her brothers would not do something like that. 7.
