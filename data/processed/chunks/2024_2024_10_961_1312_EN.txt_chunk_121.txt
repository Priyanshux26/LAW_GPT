Moreover, there has been no violation of the right of the Petitioners under Article 326 as it merely grants them the right to vote and be included in the electoral rolls, which continues to subsist to this day devoid of any interruption. As stated earlier, the Petitioners have not claimed any violation of their statutory rights and have failed to demonstrate the violation of any rights under Article 326 of the Constitution. x. Article 355 and Section 6A 345. The Petitioners contended that Section 6A is violative of Article 355 of the Constitution on account of the continued presence of millions of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam, purportedly, leading to a transformation in the demographic composition of the State. They contended that the continuing influx has resulted in a scenario where the indigenous population of Assam finds themselves effectively reduced to a minority in their own State. 346. Drawing upon the precedent in Sarbananda Sonowal (supra), the Petitioners posit that Assam is currently grappling with a state of ‘external aggression’ and ‘internal disturbance’ due to the said influx of immigrants. Consequently, they argue that it becomes the duty of the 1134 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Union, as provided in Article 355, to undertake necessary measures for the protection of Assam. In such circumstances, the Petitioners contend that Section 6A, in its current form, contravenes Article 355 and should, therefore, be deemed unconstitutional and struck down. 347. The Petitioners further argued that the Union’s obligation, as outlined in Article 355, to safeguard a ‘State’ from ‘external aggression’ encompasses not only a responsibility towards the territorial integrity but also extends to the inhabitants of the State, encompassing their culture and identity. According to the Petitioners, this duty mandates the State to shield itself from cultural aggression arising from extensive migration. 348. Au contraire, the Respondents maintained that the conclusions drawn in Sarbananda Sonowal (supra) are distinguishable, as that case primarily focused on the inadequate detection and deportation of illegal migrants entering after the year 1971, without delving into the provisions related to the grant of citizenship under Section 6A. Moreover, it is asserted that the prerequisite for ‘external aggression’ is the principle of ‘animus belligerendi’, and since the migration in question was distress-driven, intending to seek refuge in India, it should not fall within the purview of Article 355. 349. The Respondents also contend that Article 355 should not be considered an independent and standalone basis for challenging Section 6A. They argue that any challenge to Section 6A based on the alleged violation of Article 355 would be unsuccessful unless the claimed deprivation of rights can be directly linked to Part III of the Constitution. Additionally, the Respondents assert that the primary objective of Section 6A was to provide a lasting solution to the disturbances in Assam and to facilitate the governance of the state in conformity with the constitutional provisions. According to the Respondents, Section 6A therefore does not contravene the provisions of Article 355; instead, it strengthens and reinforces the principles enshrined therein.
