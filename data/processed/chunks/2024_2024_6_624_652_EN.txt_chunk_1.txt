[Paras 12, 14, 18, 26-28] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Execution of the decree by attachment of whole property when part of the property could have satisfied the decree – Impermissibility: Held: A decree for realisation of a sum in favour of the plaintiff should not amount to exploitation of the debtor by selling his entire property – The execution of a decree by sale of the entire immovable property of the debtor is not to penalise him but the same is provided to grant relief to the decree holder and to confer him the fruits of litigation – However, the right of a decree holder should never be construed to have bestowed upon him a bonanza only because he had obtained a decree for realisation of a certain amount – Court’s power to auction any property or part thereof is not just a discretion but an obligation imposed on the Court and the sale held without examining this aspect and not in conformity with this mandatory requirement would be illegal and without jurisdiction – In the case at hand, the Executing Court did not discharge its duty to ascertain whether the sale of a part of the attached property would be sufficient to satisfy the decree – When the valuation of three attached properties was mentioned in the attachment Panchanama, it was the duty of the Court to have satisfied itself on this aspect and having failed to do so the Court caused great injustice to the debtor by auctioning his entire attached properties causing huge loss to him and undue 626 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports benefit to the auction purchaser – The fact that the properties were sold for Rs. 34,000/- would further demonstrate that the decree holder who himself was the auction purchaser calculatedly offered a bid at Rs. 34,000/- despite being aware that the value of the attached properties was Rs. 1,05,700/-. [Paras 25, 27] Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – XXI, Rule 54(1) r/w XXI CPC, Rule 66 – Plea of the respondent nos.1 and 2 that the valuation of the attached properties as shown in the attachment panchanama cannot be the basis to hold that the property of the debtor valued much more than the decretal sum has been sold in execution as, Rule 54 of XXI CPC does not contemplate valuation at the time of attachment: Held: Sub-rule (2) of Rule 66 of XXI CPC mandates that the sale proclamation should mention the estimated value of the property and such estimated value can also be given under Rule 54 XXI CPC – The fact that the Court is also entitled to enter in the proclamation of sale its own estimate of the value of the property demonstrates that whenever the attached immovable property is to be sold in public auction the value thereof is required to be estimated – In between Rule 54 to Rule 66 of XXI CPC, there is no other provision requiring assessment of value of the property to be sold in auction – The provisions contained in Rule 54(1) XXI read with Rule 66 of XXI CPC are to be borne in mind wherein it is provided that either whole of the attached property or such portion thereof as may seem necessary to satisfy the decree shall be sold in auction – If there is no valuation of the property in the attachment Panchanama and there being no separate provision for valuation of the property put to auction, it is to be understood that the valuation of the property mentioned in attachment Panchanama prepared under Rule 54 can always provide the estimated value of the property otherwise the provisions enabling the court to auction only a part of the property which would be sufficient to satisfy the decree would be unworkable or redundant – In the present case, the assessed value of all the attached properties was Rs.1,05,700/- whereas the original decretal sum was Rs.27,694/- which is about 26.2% of the total value of the property – Therefore, when only one of the attached properties was sufficient to satisfy the decree there was no requirement for effecting the sale of the entire attached properties.
