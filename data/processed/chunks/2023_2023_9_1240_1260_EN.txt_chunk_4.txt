H 1246 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A b) Direct the opposite party to pay, a sum of Rs.20,000/- on account of mental agony, delay, the harassment etc. suffered by the complainant.” e) What is significant is that on the date of the complaint, the Insurance Company had not repudiated the claim. It appears from the B record that the Insurance Company had appointed an agency named “Delta Detectives” to investigate the matter and the said agency, on 27.10.2008, had recommended repudiation of the claim. f) After the complaint CPA No. 515 of 2009 was lodged on 11.06.2009, it was only on 15.10.2009 that the respondent-Insurance C Company issued a letter repudiating the claim. The relevant portion of the repudiation letter reads as follows:- “2. You, vide an intimation letter dt. 02.07.2008, informed, for the first time, that your above said Dumper No. HR-55C-5385 had been stolen on 26.06.2008. D xxx xxx xxx “5. That, thus, from the above facts as disclosed by you and your driver, it is quite clear that the theft of your Dumper No. HR- 55C-5385 was totally the result of your and your driver Mam Chand’s total negligence in not safeguarding the said vehicle E properly. It is quite clear that had the said Dumper would not have been left un-attended and further the key of the said Dumper would not have been left inside the key hole of the said Dumper, then, the same could not have been taken away by any person. In view of above contraventions and violations of the terms and conditions of the subject insurance policy, the Co. is not liable to F pay any claim in respect of the said Dumper. Therefore, the competent authority of the Co. has repudiated your claim. It may please be noted.” g) When the matter stood thus, the complaint CPA No. 515 of 2009 came up before the District Forum on 22.11.2020 when the following G statement appears to have been recorded of the advocate for the appellant, in CPA No. 515 of 2009: “I, Surender Kumar Gulia, Advocate, state that I do not want to proceed with my case. It may be dismissed. H ASHOK KUMAR v. NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. 1247 [K. V. VISWANATHAN, J.] Sd/- Sd/- A Surender Kumar Gulia, Adv.
