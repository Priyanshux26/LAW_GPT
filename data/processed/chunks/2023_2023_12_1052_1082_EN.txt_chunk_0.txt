SUPERINTENDENT OF CENTRAL EXCISE AND CUSTOMS AND OTHERS (Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013) AUGUST 18, 2023 [SANJIV KHANNA AND SUDHANSHU DHULIA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Whether the Customs Act, 1962 creates a fi rst charge overriding the charge in favour of the secured creditor. Customs Act, 1962 – Companies Act, 1956 – ss.529A, 530(1) – Customs duty ‘due and payable’ – ‘relevant date’ – Preferential payments u/clause (a) to s.530(1) – Customs Act if negates or overrides the statutory preference in terms of s.529A, Companies Act – Prior secured creditors if entitled to enforce their charge, notwithstanding the government dues payable under the Customs Act: Held: Upon import of the goods, the Company had entered the goods for home consumption u/s.46, Customs Act – However, the goods were stored in a private bonded warehouse, in the terms of s.68, Customs Act – Goods were not released on non-payment of customs duty etc. and, thereupon, show cause notices were issued and two adjudication s dated 15.09.2000 and 10.10.2000 were passed – The debt had become ‘due’ in terms of the aforesaid two adjudication s and ‘payable’ immediately – Thus, the customs duty became ‘due and payable’ prior to twelve months next to the ‘relevant date’; the ‘relevant date’ being the date of winding up of the Company on 01.12.2003 – The amount ‘due and payable’ in terms of the two adjudication s would, thus, not fall in the category of preferential payments u/clause(a) to s.530(1), Companies Act – Provisions in the Customs Act do not, in any manner, negate or override the statutory preference in terms of s.529A, Companies Act, which treats 1052 IDBI (THROUGH STRESSED ASSETS STABILIZATION FUND 1053 CONSTITUTED BY THE GoI)v. SUPT. OF CENTRAL EXCISE AND CUSTOMS AND OTHERS the secured creditors and the workmen’s dues as overriding preferential creditors; and the government dues limited to debts ‘due and payable’ in the twelve months next before the relevant date, which are to be treated as preferential payments u/s.530, Companies Act, but are ranked below overriding preferential payments and have to be paid after the payment has been made in terms of s.529 and 529A, Companies Act – Therefore, the prior secured creditors are entitled to enforce their charge, notwithstanding the government dues payable under the Customs Act – Impugned set aside – Company Application fi led by the Offi cial Liquidator allowed – Sale proceeds deposited in Supreme Court and converted into fi xed deposit receipts, along with the interest accrued thereon, be paid to the Offi cial Liquidator to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of ss.529A and 530, Companies Act – Constitution of India – Article 372(1). [Paras 22, 23, 26 and 28] Customs Act, 1962 – s.142A – Companies Act, 1956 – ss.529A, 530: Held: Provision of s.142A, insofar as it protects the rights of overriding preferential creditors governed and covered by s.529A, Companies Act, is clarifi catory and declaratory in nature, and does not lay down a new dictum or confer any new right as far as the present case is concerned – However, the enactment of s.142A of the Customs Act does confer or create a fi rst charge on the dues ‘payable’ under the Customs Act, notwithstanding provisions under any Central Act, but not in cases covered u/s.529A of the Companies Act, RDDBFI Act, SARFAESI Act and the IBC – s.142A, Customs Act, post its enactment, would dilute the impact of s.530 of the Companies Act, which had restricted preferential treatment to government taxes ‘due and payable’ limited to twelve months prior to the ‘relevant date’, without preferential right for taxes that had become ‘due and payable’ in the earlier period.
