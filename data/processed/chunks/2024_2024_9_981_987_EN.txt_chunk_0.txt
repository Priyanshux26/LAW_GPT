Headnotes† Practice and Procedure – Impleadment – Proper impleadment of parties in any proceedings is sine qua non in any matter coming before court – A corporate has a separate legal entity as compared to an individual or an officer of the company: Held: It needs to be appreciated that proper impleadment of parties in any proceedings is sine qua non in any matter coming before the court. However, what is noticed is that it has become a casualty in the process. Due care is not taken at the time of initiation of any proceedings before any forum to ensure that proper parties * Author 982 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports are impleaded. It needs to be appreciated that a corporate has a separate legal entity as compared to an individual or an officer of the company. There can be privity of contract between the corporate and any other individual and that contract or communication may have been signed by any officer on its behalf as an authorized signatory. It does not mean that the officer signing the communication or the agreement or the executive head of the company becomes individually liable for any claim against the company except the cases where any specific claim is made in that regard. Any or decree or award passed by the Court, in case proper parties are not impleaded, becomes inexecutable.
