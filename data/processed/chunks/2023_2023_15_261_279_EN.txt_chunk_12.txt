The second 2 Paragraph 24 PAWAN KUMAR v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS. 277 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] certifi cate is the medical report of the appellant i.e., Bone Ossifi cation Test conducted on 05.02.1996 which is about two months after the alleged incident where the certifi cate of the test show that he was about 19 years of age. The Radiologist (CW-3) who had conducted the test was examined in the trial, on being questioned about the veracity of the report by the defence, he said that although he had examined the appellant and conducted the Bone Ossifi cation Test but, he did not give the precise years i.e., 19 years to be the age of the appellant. According to him this has been done by the Chief Medical Offi cer (CMO). The C.M.O was never examined in the trial. In any case, a bone ossifi cation test, which is primarily done to determine the age, does not give the precise age but is at best an approximation. 30. Further, it must also be kept in mind that the medical opinion based on Bone Ossifi cation Test, is not entirely accurate. This Court in the case of Vinod Katara v. State of U.P. 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1204 has held the following: 60. The bone ossifi cation test is not an exact science that can provide us with the exact age of the person. As discussed above, the individual characteristics such as the growth rate of bones and skeletal structures can aff ect the accuracy of this method. This Court has observed in Ram Suresh Singh v. Prabhat Singh, (2009) 6 SCC 681 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1194, and Jyoti Prakash Rai v. State of Bihar, (2008) 15 SCC 223 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 796, that the ossifi cation test is not conclusive for age determination because it does not reveal the exact age of the person, but the radiological examination leaves a margin of two years on either side of the age range as prescribed by the test irrespective of whether the ossifi cation test of multiple joints is conducted. The courts in India have accepted the fact that after the age of thirty years the ossifi cation test cannot be relied upon for age determination. It is trite that the standard of proof for the determination of age is the degree of probability and not proof beyond reasonable doubt. 31. In a case of juvenility where two views are possible, this Court has held that a liberal approach should be undertaken. This position was laid down by this Court in the case of Arnit Das v. State of Bihar (2000) 5 SCC 488 where it was held that: 278 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. “19………. (ii) a hypertechnical approach should not be adopted while appreciating the evidence adduced on behalf of the accused in support of the plea that he was a juvenile and if two views may be possible on the same evidence, the court should lean in favour of holding the accused to be a juvenile in bline cases; and” This proposition of taking a liberal view and about extending the benefi t of juvenility where two views are available has been reiterated by this Court in numerous subsequent decisions such as Mukarrab and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2017) 2 SCC 210, Ashwani Kumar Saxena v. State of Madhya Pradesh (2012) 9 SCC 7503 as well as Rishipal Singh Solanki v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2022) 8 SCC 602 which concluded as follows in para 33.8: 33.8.
