88 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 64. An even more explicit demonstration of this rationale can be found in Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) v Union of India.73 The case concerned a 1977 notification under Section 25 of the Customs Act, 1962 granting a wholesale exemption from customs duty on newsprint. However, by a fresh notification in 1981, the Union Government amended its policy and stated that for the printing of newspapers, books and periodicals, the exemption from customs duty would only apply beyond 10 per cent. In effect, the 1981 notification imposed a 10 per cent ad valorem customs duty on imported newsprint from newspapers and periodicals. The 1981 notification was struck down by a three-judge bench of this Court on the ground that it impermissibly restricted the freedom of speech guaranteed by Article 19 of the Constitution.74 On the secondary question of whether the earlier 1977 notification stood revived, the Court held that it did. Justice ES Venkataramiah, as the learned Chief Justice then was, speaking for the Court held: “107. … We may also state that the legal effect on an earlier law when the later law enacted in its place is declared invalid does not depend merely upon the use of words like, ‘substitution’, or ‘supersession’. It depends upon the totality of the circumstances and the context in which they are used. […] 109. Hence, if the notification dated July 15, 1977 cannot revive on the quashing of the impugned notifications, the result would be disastrous to the petitioners as they would have to pay customs duty of 40% ad valorem from March 1, 1981 to February 28, 1982 and 40% ad valorem plus Rs 1000 per MT from March 1, 1982 onwards. […] Such a result cannot be allowed to ensue.” The Court in Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) observed that the consequence of the pre-existing law not reviving would in fact result in greater prejudice to the petitioners than if there had been no of the court at all. If after the 1981 notification 73 [1985] 2 SCR 287 : (1985) 1 SCC 641 : 1984 INSC 231 74 Ibid [102] (Venkataramiah J). [2024] 11 S.C.R. 89 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. was invalidated, the 1977 notification granting a general exemption from customs duty on newsprint did not continue in force, the net outcome would be a higher customs duty on news publishers. This was because the original notification itself was framed in the manner of an exemption from customs duty. The above extract makes it clear that in addition to the question of whether the legislative intent was indivisible, the issue of the legal effect of invalidation in cases of substitution must take into account the facts of a given case, the rationale for invalidation, and the practical effect of the unamended text being revived or not. iv. Analysis and Conclusions concerning Article 31-C 65. Based on the above precedents, certain principles governing the consequence of an amendment resulting in a substitution being invalidated come to the fore.
