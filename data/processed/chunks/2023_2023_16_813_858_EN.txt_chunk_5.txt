Board of School Education by accepting the qualifi cation of such candidate(s) for his job if that is found equivalent to 10+2 and valid for pursuing higher studies.” (J) As a result of the above decision, many candidates who, as per the 2014 Rules, were not eligible, came within the zone of consideration and as such included in the select list, resulting in ouster of such candidates who, though lower on merit, were otherwise eligible as per the 2014 Rules. Therefore, some of those ousted candidates laid a challenge to the merit list before the Tribunal through O.A. No. 5543 of 2017 which, consequent to abolition of the Tribunal, came to be transferred to the High Court and was registered as Writ Petition No. 34 of 2019. Notably, though O.A. No. 5543 of 2017 was fi led after declaration of the fi nal select list, only three or four selected candidates were initially impleaded as opposite parties. (K) While the recruitment / selection exercise under the Advertisement dated 13.02.2015 was ongoing, a fresh Advertisement No. 32-3/2016, dated 18.10.2016, was issued by the Commission inviting applications for another set of 1156 posts of JOA (IT) (Post Code 556) with the same qualifi cations as prescribed in the 2014 Rules. (L) At this stage, it would be relevant to point out that, broadly, two sets of cases cropped up from the recruitment exercise for Post Code 447, namely, (i) O.A. Nos. 2830; 2989; 2994; 2998; 3009; and 3026 of 2017, which came to be renumbered as Writ Petition Nos. 2253; 2289; ANKITA THAKUR & ORS. v. THE H.P. STAFF SELECTION 823 COMMISSION & ORS. [MANOJ MISRA, J.] 2290; 2388; 2394; and 7681 of 2020 before the High Court after abolition of the Tribunal. These cases were at the instance of candidates whose candidature was rejected for not possessing qualifi cations as prescribed by the 2014 Rules. (ii) O.A. No. 5543 of 2017, fi led on 13.10.2017, which, upon transfer to the High Court, came to be registered as Writ Petition No. 34 of 2019 before the High Court. This was by those candidates who were not placed in the select list. Their claim was that the relaxation dated 21.08.2017 resulted in inclusion of ineligible candidates and, therefore, they were ousted from the merit list. In this O.A. No. 5543 of 2017), the relief(s) sought were: (i) That clarifi cation dated 21.08.2017 and Offi ce dated 18.09.2017 be quashed and set aside; and (ii) That Commission be directed to prepare a merit list from amongst those candidates who possess essential and minimum qualifi cation as mentioned in Advertisement No. 30 of 2015, dated 13.02.2015, and make recommendation accordingly. (M) As in between, another Advertisement (i.e., for Post Code 556) was issued, the State Government vide letter dated 19.03.2018 directed the Commission to apply the clarifi cation issued on 21.08.2017 for Post Code 556 as well. The relevant portion of the letter dated 19.03.2018 is extracted below: “l am directed to refer to your letters No.
