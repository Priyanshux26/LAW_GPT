The objection also noted that the land was originally allotted for promoting Information Technology and related industry in the Electronic City but the allottee had completely changed usage of the said land by wanting to set up a hotel which fell in the hospitality sector. The objection of the Audit Party is reproduced hereunder: “6. The allotment of land in January 2006 was infl uenced by the objective of setting up of IT related industry. However, in contravention the Allottee proposed (June/July 2007) to construct the Hotel. 788 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. Therefore, the consent should have been accorded by charging the prevailing rate of plot (Rs.3.2 Crores per acre) in terms of clause 3(4) (ii) of the Land cum Sale Agreement. Failure to do so, that caused loss to the Company to extent of Rs.46.25 lakhs. Further, the rate of Rs.3.20 Crore per acre was applicable to residential purpose and the rate has to be increased by 40 percent for commercial purpose. Considering this loss would further increase by Rs.32 lakhs.” 20. It is true that initially the appellant tried to justify the demand of change in activity of Rs.5 lakhs calculated at the rate being Rs.1 Crore per acre but later on it realized that the audit objection was correct and, therefore, the appellant was entitled to demand the revised fi nal rate as determined by the 141st Board meeting. It would be relevant to reproduce the Resolution of Board of Directors passed in its 141st meeting: “EXTRACT OF THE RESOLUTION PASSED AT THE 141ST MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF M/S.
