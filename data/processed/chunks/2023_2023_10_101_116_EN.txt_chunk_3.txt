Vide Circular dated 14th December, 1993,the Commissioner clarified that the D exemption would remain in effect—a specific notification will prevail over a general entry in the Schedule. It was further stated that the process of obtaining maize starch from maize involves simple processing; therefore, maize starch will be classified as ‘maize products’ and covered by the Exemption Notification. E e) The Legislature next amended6 the Act w.e.f. 1st April, 1994. Entry No. 8 of Part B of Schedule III (“Exemption Entry No. 8”, hereafter) was inserted exempting “products of millets (rice, flour, brokens and bran of cholam, cumbu, ragi, thinai, varagu, samai, kudiraivali, milo and maize)” F from taxation under the Act. The amendment retained the language of the Exemption Notification except that the word ‘like’ was omitted. Although, in effect, the Exemption Notification lost force with the amendment of the Schedule, nevertheless, the exemption on maize starch remained G unchanged based on subsequent clarifications issued by the Commissioner on 31st December, 1996 and 6th May, 1997. 4 The TNGST (Amendment) Act, 1993(Act No. 24 of 1993) 5 The TNGST (Second Amendment) Act, 1996 (Act No. 37 of 1996) 6 The TNGST (Amendment) Act, 1994(Act No. 32 of 1994) H 106 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A f) However, this position was followed by two subsequent developments - the latter being crucial for the present purpose. Firstly, Section 28-A was inserted w.e.f. 6th November, 1997 by way of an amendment7 to the Act which empowered, by way of a statutory provision, the Commissioner to issue clarifications concerning the rate of B tax under the Act. Secondly, after the insertion of Section 28-A, the Commissioner issued a Circular dated 23rd June, 1998, clarifying that Exemption Entry No. 8 does not encompass maize starch; the said entry only applies to products listed within the brackets and excludes maize starch C which is distinct from maize flour and not commonly understood as such by ordinary people or even dealers. Being covered by Entry 67 of Part D of Schedule I, it will be taxed at 11%. However, a request having been received from the appellant for withdrawal of the Circular dated 23rd June, 1998, the Commissioner vide a subsequent Circular D dated 8th October, 1998 cancelled the earlier Circular dated 23rd June, 1998 and clarified that maize starch is taxable from 1st April, 1994, since Item 8 of Part B of Schedule III does not include maize starch. In view of specific Entry No. 61 of Part D of Schedule I, i.e., “sago and starch of E any kind”, it covers maize starch also, subject to a 4% tax to be levied w.e.f. 17th July, 1996 and not tax at 11%. g) Questioning the aforesaid clarification, the appellant made a representation before the Commissioner which came to be rejected on 28th June, 1999. The appellant was served F with notices8 for recovery of general sales tax to the tune of Rs 7,69,729/- for FY 1998-1999, followed by a provisional assessment notice9 issued by the Commissioner.
