Resultantly, the Revenue had time until 30 June 2021 to issue a reassessment notice for assessment year 2017- 2018 under Section 149(1)(a). This harmonious reading gives effect to the legislative intention of both the Income Tax Act and TOLA. Moreover, Sections 147 to 151 are machinery provisions. Therefore, they must be given an interpretation that is consistent with the object and purpose of the Income Tax Act. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1687 Union of India & Ors. v. Rajeev Bansal 70. In Income-tax Officer v. Vikram Sujitkumar Bhatia,126 a two-Judge Bench of this Court had to decide whether Section 153C of the Income Tax Act, as amended by the Finance Act 2015, would apply to searches conducted before 1 June 2015 (the date of coming into force of the amendment). This Court observed that since Section 153C is a machinery provision, it should be interpreted in a manner to effectuate the object and purpose of the statute. It was observed that the object and purpose of Section 153C was the assessment of the income of any other person. It was held that if the amended provision is made applicable prospectively, it will frustrate the object and purpose of Section 153C. 71. Section 3(1) of TOLA contains a non obstante clause: “notwithstanding anything contained in the specified Act.” The legislative intention of including the non obstante clause is to remove any obstacles which may come in the way of the operation of the extension of the time limit till 31 March 2021 or such other date after 31 March 2021 specified by the Central Government. The purpose is to ensure that the full benefit of the relaxation should be provided to both the assesses and the Revenue to tide over the difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 72. The non obstante clause in Section 3(1) has to be read as controlling the provisions of the specified Acts, including the provisions of the Income Tax Act.127 In the context of the issuance of a reassessment notice, the non obstante clause will override the provisions of the Income Tax Act in case of any direct conflict or inconsistency. Section 3(1) overrides Section 149 only to the extent of relaxing the time limit for issuance of reassessment notice under Section 148. The time limit for issuance of a reassessment notices, which fall for completion between 20 March 2020 and 31 March 2021,has been extended till 30 June 2021. However, the non obstante clause under Section 3(1) of TOLA will operate neither to extend the time limit of three years from the end of the relevant assessment year under Section 149(1)(a) of the new regime nor to extend the time limit of six years from the end of the relevant assessment years under Section 149(1)(b) of the old regime. The non obstante clause 126 (2023) 453 ITR 417 127 M P V Sundararamier v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 1958 SCC OnLine SC 22 1688 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports ensures that the Revenue has additional time beyond the statutory stipulated time limit to complete or comply with the formalities given the administrative difficulties that arose due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
