[2024] 10 S.C.R. 79 : 2024 INSC 744 Lakha Singh v. Balwinder Singh & Anr. (Civil Appeal No. 10893 of 2024) 27 September, 2024 [Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Sandeep Mehta,* JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the entire case of the respondent-plaintiff regarding execution of the disputed agreement; alleged payment of Rs.16,00,000/- in cash to the appellant-defendant and alleged appearance of the respondent-plaintiff in the office of sub-registrar in the purported exercise of getting the sale deed executed in terms of the disputed agreement was fraud and concoction. Headnotes† Contract – Specific Performance – Respondent filed a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell in respect of an agricultural plot of land – In alternative, respondent-plaintiff, inter-alia, sought relief of recovery of Rs.19,00,000/- including the amount of Rs.16,00,000/- paid as earnest money on the date of execution of the disputed agreement – Trial Court allowed the suit partly, directing recovery of Rs.16,00,000/- and denied the prayer of specific performance – The first appeal as well as the second appeal preferred by the appellant-defendant were rejected – Correctness: Held: In the instant case, the stamp papers were not purchased by the appellant-defendant nor respondent-plaintiff – The document was typed out in Gurmukhi language and the photostat copy thereof is available on record – The disputed agreement runs into 3 pages – The signature of the respondent-plaintiff, and the thumb impression of the appellant-defendant are marked only on the last page thereof – The first and second pages of the agreement, do not bear the signature of the respondent-plaintiff or the thumb impression of the appellant-defendant – There exist significant blank spaces at the foot of the first two pages below the transcription typed out on these two pages – These observations give rise to a strong inference fortifying the contention of the * Author 80 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports appellant-defendant’s counsel that the thumb impression of the appellant-defendant may have been taken on a blank stamp paper and the disputed agreement was typed thereon subsequently – Respondent-plaintiff did not take permission from his department before entering into an agreement to sell of such a high value – According to the disputed agreement, appellant-defendant agreed to sell his land @ Rs.5,00,000/- per Killa, which was half of the market rate of the land – Going by the rate fixed, the total sale consideration of the land would have been Rs.18,87,000/- – However, the disputed agreement recites that appellant-defendant had received an earnest money of Rs.16,00,000/-, which is lion’s share of the total sale consideration – Therefore, it does not stand to reason that why respondent-plaintiff would defer execution of sale deed to a date almost 16 months later, when only 15% of the total value was remaining – Thus, the disputed agreement i.e., the agreement to sell is highly suspicious – As far as appearance of respondent-plaintiff in the sub-registrar office is concerned, admittedly, the respondent-plaintiff did not give any advance intimation to the appellant-defendant imploring him to receive the balance consideration and execute the sale deed on the scheduled date i.e.
