In this context, the three judges’ bench in Sundaresh Bhatt, Liquidator of ABG Shipyard (supra) has referred to Section 238 of the IBC to observe that Section 238 of the IBC clearly overrides any provision of law which is inconsistent with the IBC. This has also made reference to Section 142A of the Customs Act, which reads thus: 32 These provisions, though relevant, are not being reproduced for the sake of brevity. 33 As defi ned and payable in terms of Section 529(3)(b) of the Companies Act. 34 (2022) 7 SCC 260. 35 (2023) 1 SCC 472. 36 For short, ‘IBC’. 1080 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. “142A. Liability under Act to be fi rst charge.—Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Central Act or State Act, any amount of duty, penalty, interest or any other sum payable by an assessee or any other person under this Act, shall, save as otherwise provided in Section 529-A of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and the Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (51 of 1993), the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and the Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 be the fi rst charge on the property of the assessee or the person, as the case may be.” Section 142A of the Customs Act was inserted by Act 8 of 2011 with eff ect from 8th April 2011. It does not apply to the present litigation. Section 142A of the Customs Act protects and ensures that the dues under the Customs Act do not, in any way, aff ect the rights of third parties under Section 529A of the Companies Act or rights of the parties as per provisions of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and the Financial Institutions Act, 199337, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and the Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 200238 and the IBC. Read in this manner, it is clear to us that the provision of Section 142A of the Customs Act, insofar as it protects the rights of overriding preferential creditors governed and covered by Section 529A of the Companies Act, is clarifi catory and declaratory in nature, and does not lay down a new dictum or confer any new right as far as the present case is concerned. However, the enactment of section 142A of the Customs Act does confer or create a fi rst charge on the dues ‘payable’ under the Customs Act, notwithstanding provisions under any Central Act, but not in cases covered under Section 529A of the Companies Act, RDDBFI Act, SARFAESI Act and the IBC. Section 142A of the Customs Act, post its enactment, would dilute the impact of Section 530 of the Companies Act, which had restricted preferential treatment to government taxes ‘due and payable’ limited to twelve months prior to the ‘relevant date’, without preferential right for taxes that had become ‘due and payable’ in the earlier period. 37 For short, ‘RDDBFI Act’.
