Housing Society v. Swaraj Developers51] The legislative intent is clear. Rules made by virtue of statutory powers prescribe both a mandate and a time limit. The same has to be followed. Here itself we may clarify that the conclusion arrived at by us in respect of the strict adherence to the timeline mentioned in Rules 3 & 4 of the 2008, Rules shall not affect any decision of the authorities where the same may or may not have been followed 48 [1984] 2 SCR 914 : (1984) 2 SCC 500 49 [1991] 3 SCR 873 : 1992 Supp (1) SCC 323 50 [1997] Supp. 2 SCR 267 : (1997) 6 SCC 312 *dissenting opinion of Saghir Ahmad, J. 51 [2003] 3 SCR 762 : (2003) 6 SCC 659 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 363 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. as on date of this . For ample clarity, it is stated that the observations made in this shall apply prospectively. Independent Review 34. The bone of contention in this regard is that since both the recommending and the granting authorities took merely a day each in performing their respective functions, the requirement of an independent review which is to be undertaken by both authorities has been left unfulfilled thereby vitiating the sanction in question. 35. The meaning of the word independent, as is well understood, is that the act, or as in this case, evaluation is made in a way which is lone standing or which does not rely on any other factor, such as previous consideration or evaluation by another authority, to arrive at its conclusion. 35.1 The Cambridge dictionary defines the word independent to mean: – “not influenced or controlled in any way by other people, events, or things” 35.2 The Merriam Webster dictionary defines the word independent as:- “1: not dependent: such as a (1): not subject to control by others ; (2): not affiliated with a larger controlling unit b (1): not requiring or relying on something else : not contingent; (2): not looking to others for one’s opinions or for guidance in conduct; (3): not bound by or committed to a political party c (1): not requiring or relying on others (as for care or livelihood); (2): being enough to free one from the necessity of working for a living d: showing a desire for freedom” 35.3 The Black’s Law Dictionary defines: “INDEPENDENT. Not dependent; not subject to control, restriction, modification, or limitation from a given outside source.” 364 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Independence, which is the state of being independent would also be instructive in our understanding. “INDEPENDENCE. The state or condition of being free from dependence, subjection, or control. A state of perfect irresponsibility. Political independence is the attribute of a nation or state which is entirely autonomous, and not subject to the government, control, or dictation of any exterior power.” 36. Review, as a concept is to be understood for it is the coming together of these two aspects which will form our understanding of the term ‘independent review’.
