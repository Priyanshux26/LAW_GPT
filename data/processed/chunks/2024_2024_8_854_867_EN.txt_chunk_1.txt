The present appeal calls in question the correctness of the of the High Court of Tripura at Agartala dated 20.06.2022 in W.A. No. 5 of 2020. By virtue of the said , the Division Bench of the High Court confirmed the of the learned Single Judge dated 04.12.2019 dismissing the writ petition of the Appellant. Brief facts: 3. The facts lie in a narrow compass. One Dr. Praveen Kumar Mishra was working as an Associate Professor in Law in the Respondent- University. On 27.11.2015, the Executive Council of the Respondent- University granted a lien for one year to Dr. Praveen Kumar Mishra to enable him to join the post of Associate Professor in Law in Sikkim University. On 02.12.2015, Dr. Praveen Kumar Mishra joined Sikkim University. 4. On 05.05.2016, the Respondent-University issued an advertisement through an employment notification for various posts by inviting applications from suitable candidates. In the Department of Law, for the post of Assistant Professor, three vacancies were advertised. One was an unreserved regular vacancy. One was a lien vacancy in the Open category and one was a lien vacancy for the OBC candidates. The pay-scale was Rs.15600-39100 and the Grade Pay was Rs.6,000/-. In the note appended in Clause 19, it was mentioned “Appointment made to the posts against LIEN vacancy are likely to be regularized subject to vacation of lien and satisfactory performance.” Importantly, it was a common advertisement for all the three vacancies. We say this, at the outset, because both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench proceeded on the basis [2024] 8 S.C.R. 857 Maitreyee Chakraborty v. The Tripura University & Ors. that what was advertised was only a lien vacancy. No doubt, two of the vacancies were lien vacancies. However, there was one regular post also notified in the Unreserved category and hence it will be too much to assume that candidates would not have applied in full measure on the premise that only lien vacancies were advertised.
