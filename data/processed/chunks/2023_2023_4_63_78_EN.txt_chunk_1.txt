Partly allowing the appeal, the Court HELD: 1. It is required to be noted that HSN Code 3808 has been deleted from Entry 44(5) w.e.f. 01.07.2006 and from D 21.01.2006 the aforesaid products would fall under Sl. No.66 namely ‘Mosquito repellant’, which is the specific entry and subject to VAT at 12.5%. The insecticides under Entry 44(5) therefore can be said to be a general entry. Once there is a specific entry the ‘Mosquito Repellant’, thereafter one is not required to E go to the definition under another Act namely Insecticides Act. Sl.No.66 of Notification SRO 82/06 dated 21.01.2006 issued under Section 6(1)(d) of the Kerala VAT Act which covers “Mosquito Repellants”. [Para 9][74-H; 75-A-B] 2.

[Para 9.3][75-G-H] 4. Considering the dominant use of Dettol and the active ingredients of Dettol referred to hereinabove and that the Dettol B is used as an antiseptic and is used in hospitals for surgical use, medical use and midwifery due to therapeutic & prophylactic properties the same would fall under Entry 36(8) (h) (vi) as claimed by the appellant and would not fall under the residuary entry as claimed by the Revenue. [Para 9.10][78-B] C 5. As per the settled position of law while considering a particular entry the principles of classification which are fundamental to any matter relating to classification under the taxing statute are: (a) plain meaning to be given to the taxing provision; (b) burden to prove classification in a particular entry D is always on the Revenue; (c) any ambiguity has to be resolved in favour of the assessee and in case of a reasonable doubt, the construction most beneficial to the assessee must be adopted; (d) specific entry would override a residuary entry; and (e) resort to residuary entry is to be taken as a last measure, only when by E liberal construction the specific entry cannot cover the goods in question.
