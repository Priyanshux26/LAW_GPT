The meaning of the expression “in the course of the same transaction” used in Section 223 is not materially different from that expression used in Section 223(1) [sic 235(1)]. It is so understood by this Court in State of A.P. v. Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao [AIR 1963 SC 1850 : (1964) 3 SCR 297] . The following observation in the said is contextually quotable: “The series of acts which constitute a transaction must of necessity be connected with one another and if some of them stand out independently, they would not form part of the same transaction but would constitute a different transaction or transactions. Therefore, even if the expression ‘same transaction’ alone had been used in Section 235(1) it would have 63 [1999] Supp. 4 SCR 120 : (2000) 1 SCC 285 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 375 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. meant a transaction consisting either of a single act or of a series of connected acts. The expression ‘same transaction’ occurring in clauses (a), (c) and (d) of Section 239 as well as that occurring in Section 235(1) ought to be given the same meaning according to the normal rule of construction of statutes.” 12. For several offences to be part of the same transaction, the test which has to be applied is whether they are so related to one another in point of purpose or of cause and effect, or as principal and subsidiary, so as to result in one continuous action. Thus, where there is a commonality of purpose or design, where there is a continuity of action, then all those persons involved can be accused of the same or different offences “committed in the course of the same transaction”.” 44.2 In R. Dineshkumar v. State,64 this Court considered the aspect of ‘transaction’ in the following terms: “…19.3. This Court after taking note of the fact that the clause “same transaction” is not defined under the CrPC opined that the meaning of the clause should depend upon the facts of each case. However, this Court indicated that where there is a proximity of time or place or unity of purpose and design or continuity of action in respect of a series of acts, it is possible to infer that they form part of the same transaction. This Court also cautioned that every one of the abovementioned elements need not co-exist for a transaction to be regarded as the “same transaction”. 20. According to us, the principle enunciated in Ganeswara Rao case [AIR 1963 SC 1850 : (1963) 2 Cri LJ 671] is that where several persons are alleged to have committed several separate offences, which, 64 [2015] 5 SCR 605 : (2015) 7 SCC 497 376 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports however, are not wholly unconnected, then there may be a joint trial unless such joint trial is likely to cause either embarrassment or difficulty to the accused in defending themselves.” 44.3 In Nasib Singh v. State of Punjab,65 DY Chandrachud, J (as his Lordship then was) speaking for a three-judge Bench formulated the following principles in respect of joint or separate trials: “51.1.
