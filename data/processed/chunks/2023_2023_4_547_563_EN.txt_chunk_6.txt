To uphold the respondent’s move would directly violate the appellants’ rights under Article 20 (1). 11. Mr. Harris Beeran, learned counsel for the respondent, relied upon the statement of objects and reasons of the amendment to the Wakf Act of 2013. He placed emphasis on the rationale behind inclusion F of Section 52A, that is to declare illegal holding and occupation of lands as criminal offence. As far as the appellants’ argument regarding the retrospective application of the provision is concerned, counsel relied on Securities & Exchange Board of India v. Ajay Agarwal8(hereafter “Ajay Agarwal”) and Mohan Lal v. State of Rajasthan9 to urge that G since the appellantsare still in possession of the property, the amendment applies to them. 8 (2010) 3 SCR 70. 9 (2015) 6 SCC 222. H 556 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 12. It was urged by the respondents that the premises were leased to the appellants without obtaining prior sanction of the Board on 15.09.1973 for a period of 11 months by the then Managing Trustee Mr. K. V. Kunhammed Koya who was later removed by the Board as per the in the proceedings Number 2/1976 dated 09.09.1978 due to misfeasance and malfeasance. The accused have been conducting a B business concern,”Norman Printing Bureau”, in the waqf building for the last more than 40 years without any right tocontinue in it. As per Section 56 of the Waqf Act, 1995, the Mutawalli/ Managing Trustee of waqf has no authority to leaseout the building without obtaining prior sanction of the Board. C 13. Learned counsel submitted that in view of Section 472 Cr.PC, the continued possession of the appellants constituted a continuing offence. Regardless of previous occupation, once the penal provision became part of law, under the 2013 amendment, the appellants’ conduct stood exposed to the risk of criminal prosecution. In such circumstances, D the reliance on Article 20 (1) is misplaced. III 14. The Wakf Act, 1954 was a precursor to the enactment of the Wakf Act, 1995. This court explained the scheme of the 1995 Act in Ramesh Gobindram (Dead) through L.Rs. v Sugra Humayun Mirza E Wakf10as “Wakfs and matters relating thereto were for a long time governed by the Wakf Act, 1954. The need for a fresh legislation on the subject was, however, felt because of the deficiencies noticed in the working of the said earlier F enactment especially those governing the Wakf Boards, their power of superintendence and control over the management of individual wakfs. Repeated amendments to the 1954 Act, having failed to provide effective answers to the questions that kept arising for consideration, the Parliament had to bring a comprehensive legislation in the form of Wakf Act G 1995 for better administration of wakfs and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Chapter I of the 1995 Act deals with Preliminaries like definitions, title, extent and commencement and application H 10 2010 (10) SCR 945. P. V. NIDHISH & ORS. v. KERALA STATE WAKF BOARD & 557 ANR.
