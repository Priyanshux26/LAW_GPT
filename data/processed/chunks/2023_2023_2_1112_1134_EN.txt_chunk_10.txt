Jain observed that courts B ought to refrain from mechanically granting bail and absence of relevant considerations will make such an susceptible to interference. Para 13 of the said is relevant and is reproduced herein below :- “13. ……Though at the stage of granting bail an elaborate examination of evidence and detailed reasons touching the merit C of the case, which may prejudice the accused, should be avoided, but there is a need to indicate in such reasons for prima facie concluding why bail was being granted particularly where the accused is charged of having committed a serious offence. (See also State of Maharashtra v. Ritesh21, Panchanan Mishra v. Digambar Mishra And Others22, Vijay Kumar v. Narendra D and Others23 and Anwari Begum v. Sher Mohammad And Another24)” [Also refer : Neeru Yadav v. State of Uttar Pradesh And Another25; Anil Kumar Yadav v. State (NCT Of Delhi) And Another26 and Mahipal v Rajesh Kumar Alias Polia And E Another27] 14. Stressing on the necessity to look into the earlier s where the bail applications of the accused have been rejected, this Court in Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav And Another28held thus :- F 17 (2005) 8 SCC 21 18 (2001) 4 SCC 280 19 (2002) 3 SCC 598 20 (2009) 14 SCC 286 21 (2001) 4 SCC 224 G 22 (2005) 3 SCC 143 23 (2002) 9 SCC 364 24 (2005) 7 SCC 326 25 (2014) 16 SCC 508 26 (2018) 12 SCC 129 27 (2020) 2 SCC 118 H 28 (2004) 7 SCC 528 MS. X v. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND ANOTHER 1127 [HIMA KOHLI, J.] “12. In regard to cases where earlier bail applications have been A rejected there is a further onus on the court to consider the subsequent application for grant of bail by noticing the grounds on which earlier bail applications have been rejected and after such consideration if the court is of the opinion that bail has to be granted then the said court will have to give specific reasons why in spite B of such earlier rejection the subsequent application for bail should be granted.” 15. In Sushila Aggarwal and Others v. State (NCT of Delhi) And Another29, a Constitution Bench comprising of five Judges was confronted with conflicting views of different Benches of varying strength C on the following two questions framed for consideration :- “(i) Whether the protection granted to a person under Section 438 CrPC should be limited to a fixed period so as to enable the person to surrender before the trial court and seek regular bail. (ii) Whether the life of an anticipatory bail should end at the time D and stage when the accused is summoned by the court.” After an extensive discussion, the Constitution Bench distilled the Law and answered the above reference in para 91 in the following words:- “91.1. Regarding Question 1, this Court holds that the protection E granted to a person under Section 438 CrPC should not invariably be limited to a fixed period; it should enure in favour of the accused without any restriction on time.
