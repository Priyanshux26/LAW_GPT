216 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 1. Since the pivotal question of law involved in all the captioned petitions is the same, they were taken up for hearing analogously and are being disposed of by this common and . 2. For the sake of convenience, the Review Petition No. 400 of 2021 filed by the Customs Department is treated as the lead matter. 3. This Review Petition has been filed by the Customs Department through the Commissioner of Customs, New Delhi (the “Department”) under XLVII of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 seeking review of the and dated 09.03.2021 passed by this Court in Civil Appeal No. 1827 of 2018 titled M/s Canon India Private Ltd. v. Commissioner of Customs. A. FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF THE REVIEW PETITION 4. A two-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Commissioner of Customs v. Sayed Ali and Another reported in (2011) SCC 537, had held that the Commissioner of Customs (Preventive) is not a “proper officer” as defined in Section 2(34) of the Customs Act, 1962 (“the Act, 1962”) and therefore did not have the jurisdiction to issue a show cause notice in terms of Section 28 of the Act, 1962. The Court observed that while all proper officers must be “officers of customs”, all “officers of customs” are not proper officers. It also held that only those officers of customs who were assigned the functions of assessment, which would include re-assessment, working under the jurisdictional collectorate within whose jurisdiction the bills of entry or baggage declarations had been filed and consignments had been cleared for home consumption, would have the jurisdiction to issue show cause notice under Section 28 or else it would lead to a situation of utter chaos and confusion, in as much as all officers of customs in a particular area, be it under the Collectorate of Customs (Imports) or the Preventive Collectorate, would fall under the definition of “proper officers”. Section 2(34) is extracted below: “(34) proper officer in relation to any functions to be performed under this Act, means the officer of customs who is assigned those functions by the Board or the Principal Commissioner of Customs or Commissioner of Customs” 5. As a result of the decision in Sayed Ali (supra), the Central Board of Excise and Customs (the “Board”) issued Notification No. 44/2011-Cus-NT dated 06.07.2011 under Section 2(34) of the [2024] 12 S.C.R. 217 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. Act, 1962, assigning the functions of the “proper officers” to the Commissioners of Customs (Preventive), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (“DRI”), Directorate General of Anti Evasion (“DGAE”) and Officers of Central Excise. The notification specified that it would operate prospectively. With a view to account for the past periods, Section 28(11) was introduced vide the Customs (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2011 (Act No.14 of 2011) dated 16.09.2011 by virtue of which all persons appointed as Officers of Customs under sub-section (1) of Section 4 before the 06.07.2011 were deemed to have and always had the power of assessment under Section 17 and were deemed to be and always have been “proper officers” for the purpose of the said section.
