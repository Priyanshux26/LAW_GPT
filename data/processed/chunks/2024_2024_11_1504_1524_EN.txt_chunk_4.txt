Additionally, it is submitted that Hinduism does not prescribe any procedure to do conversion, however the key requirement for regaining caste status is that the reconvert must show a sincere intention to fully return to their original community, completely abandoning the new religion and embracing the customs and practices of their former caste, without opposition from its members. To buttress the same, the learned counsel placed reliance on the following decisions and the principles laid down therein: (a) S.Anbalagan v. B.Devarajan and others 5 - ‘For reconversion to Hinduism, no particular ceremony such as expiratory rites need be performed unless the practice of the caste makes it necessary’. 5 [1984] 1 SCR 973 : (1984) 2 SCC 112 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1511 C. Selvarani v. The Special Secretary-Cum-District Collector and Others (b) The Principal, Guntur Medical College, Guntur and others v. Mohan Rao6- ‘Even if a person does lose the membership of his caste, on reconversion to another religion, he can once again become a member of the caste in which he was born and to which he belonged before conversion to another religion, if the members of the caste accept him as a member’. (c) KP Manu v. Chairman, Scrutiny Committee7 - ‘Three things that need to be established by a person who claims to be a beneficiary of the caste certificate are:(i) there must be absolutely clear-cut proof that he belongs to the caste that has been recognized by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) ,1950; (ii) there has been reconversion to the original religion to which the parents and earlier generations had belonged; and (iii)there has to be evidence establishing the acceptance by the community’. (d) Mohammad Sadique v. Darbara Singh Guru8 - ‘A person can change his religion and faith but not the caste, to which he belongs, as caste has linkage to birth’. (e) Kailash Sonkar v. Maya Devi9 - ‘A caste to which a Hindu belongs is essentially determined by birth. When a person is converted to Christianity or some other religion, the original caste remains under eclipse and as soon as during his/her lifetime the person is reconverted to the original religion, the eclipse disappears and the caste automatically revives. However, where it appears that the person reconverted to the old religion had been converted to Christianity since several generations, it may be difficult to apply the doctrine of eclipse to the revival of caste’. Thus, according to the learned counsel, the appellant being a Hindu by religion and belonging to Valluvan caste, is entitled to the issuance of Scheduled Caste community certificate and denial of the same by the respondent authorities as affirmed 6 [1976] 3 SCR 1046 : (1976) 3 SCC 411 7 [2015] 3 SCR 243 : (2015) 1 SCC 1 : 2015 SCC OnLine SC 161 8 [2016] 4 SCR 372 : AIR 2016 SC 2054 9 [1984] 2 SCR 176 : (1984) 2 SCC 91 1512 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports by the High Court, is arbitrary, illegal and unconstitutional and therefore, the s impugned in this appeal as well as in the writ petitions deserve to be set aside.
