2,83,500 per square meter on Bellary Road, and for Jayamahal Road it is fixed at Rs. 2,04,000 per square meter (see convenience compilation filed on 21.07.2024 at pages 248 and 249) and this value is not adopted. Secondly, the applicable rules for issuance of TDR is [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1315 Chaduranga Kanthraj Urs and Anr. v. P. Ravi Kumar and Ors. known and called as Karnataka Town and Country Planning (Benefit of Development Rights) Rules 2016. Section 2(i) defines ‘Market Value’ to mean the value determined as per the guidance value of land in accordance with Section 45B of the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957. Thus, the TDR has to be issued as per the guidance value fixed under the Stamp Act and it is for this precise reason the State while determining the market value of the subject land had adopted the guidance value as specified under the Stamp Act for purposes of calculation/determination under I.A. No. 98276 of 2021 for pleading financial hardship. The State Government cannot now retrace its steps in this regard and determine the value of the subject property at its whims or fancies or on any imaginary value for the purposes of issuance of TDR. Thirdly, the market value of the property has to be prescribed under Rule 4 of TDR Rules, which clearly mandates the “market value” of a property to be as prescribed under Section 45B of Stamp Act, as the basis for issuance of TDR. In fact, this Court by s dated 21.11.2014, 17.05.2022 and 19.03.2024 in no uncertain terms has ed or directed the respondents to issue TDR as per TDR Rules. Fourthly, in the interlocutory application (I.A. No. 98276 of 2021) filed for modification by the State, it has been specifically pleaded by the State itself that “if the compensation was required to be paid in terms of the award passed under the Act of 1996, then for the extent of 15 acres and 39 guntas the compensation payable would be Rs. 37,28,813. However, if the TDR certificate is to be issued as per TDR rules for the said extent of 15 acres 39 guntas, it would result in 13,91,742 sq. feet additional built up area constructable in the city of Bengaluru and approximately it would be equivalent to notional value of Rs.1,396 crores” after deducting 60% of the guidance value. The State specifically pleaded that TDR once granted is transferable and it would not be possible to recover the value of the TDR from the appellants if it is transferred to other parties/ builders, in the event of final going against the appellants. In fact, it is for this precise reason we have opined supra that s dated 21.11.2014 and 17.05.2022 was not required to be tweaked by this Court by adding additional conditions. Fifthly, it is to be noted that when value of adjacent and abutting land is fixed at Rs. 2,83,500 per sq. meter and 2,04,000 per sq. meter respectively under the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957, the value of subject land cannot be diminished below the said value.
