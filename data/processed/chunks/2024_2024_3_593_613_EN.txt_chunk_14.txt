As the land stood regranted, the tenant acquired the right to purchase the said land by virtue of the provisions of the Tenancy Act. 29. In Kondabai Ganu Barkale (since deceased) through her Legal Heirs Smt. Housabai P Bhongale and others vs. Pandit @ Shankar D. Patil (since deceased) through his Legal Heirs Waman S.Patil and others6, a learned Judge noted that the Tribunal had erred in holding that the tenancy in that case was created long after Tillers’ Day. The learned judge found that there was no dispute as to the fact that the tenancy in respect of the said land was created long before Tillers’ Day and by virtue of Section 88CA of the Tenancy Act, Section 32 to Section 32–R of the Tenancy Act were inapplicable thereto at that time. However, after the Abolition Act and regrant of the Watan land to the landlord thereunder, the provisions of the Tenancy Act became applicable to the subject land with full vigour. Such application, by operation of law, was not to be treated as the creation of a new tenancy by the landlord after Tillers’ Day. The Tribunal was, therefore, held to be in clear error in applying the provisions of Section 32O of the Tenancy Act to the case. 30. We find ourselves in respectful and complete agreement with the views expressed by the Bombay High Court in the above decisions. In the case on hand, it is the contention of the appellants that there was no lease subsisting as on 01.01.1963, owing to the dated 18.04.1961 passed upon the application made by the legal heirs under Section 5 of the 1874 Act after the death of the original Watandar. They would further contend that as the possession of the Watan lands was actually restored to the legal heirs on 22.04.1962, the tenants were not even in possession on the appointed date, viz., 01.01.1963. In effect, their argument is that neither a lawful lease was in existence nor were 5 (2004) 3 Mah. L.J. 75 6 (2016) 2 Mah. LJ 282 612 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the tenants in physical possession on the said date. However, this argument loses sight of the fact that the dated 18.04.1961 had not attained finality inasmuch as the tenants subjected it to challenge before the higher authorities and their challenge was still pending. No doubt, the High Court erroneously referred to the ‘misconceived appeal’ filed by them as ‘revisional proceedings’ but notwithstanding the nomenclature, the inescapable fact remains that the challenge to the initial dated 18.04.1961 was subsisting as on 22.04.1962, the date of delivery of possession, and such proceedings of challenge concluded in favour of the tenants when their revision was allowed, vide the dated 03.05.1982. Merely because no stay was granted in such proceedings and, in consequence, the tenants stood divested of actual physical possession, it did not lend any finality to the impugned in those proceedings and, therefore, the purported termination of the lease still hung in balance.
