[Para 36] 490 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Advocates – Relationship between an Advocate and his Client – Nature of control – Unique attributes: Held : Advocates are generally perceived to be their client’s agents and owe fiduciary duties to their clients – Advocates are fastened with all the traditional duties that agents owe to their principals – Advocates have to respect the client’s autonomy to make decisions at a minimum, as to the objectives of the representation – Advocates are not entitled to make concessions or give any undertaking to the Court without express instructions from the Client – It is the solemn duty of an Advocate not to transgress the authority conferred on him by his Client – Advocate is bound to seek appropriate instructions from the Client or his authorized agent before taking any action or making any statement or concession which may, directly or remotely, affect the legal rights of the Client – Advocate represents the client before the Court and conducts proceedings on behalf of the client – He is the only link between the court and the client – Thus, his responsibility is onerous – He is expected to follow the instructions of his client rather than substitute his – Thus, a considerable amount of direct control is exercised by the Client over the manner in which an Advocate renders his services during the course of his employment.
