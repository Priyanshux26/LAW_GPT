Sub-section (4) of Section 43, inter alia, provides that where the court s that an arbitral award be set aside, the period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of the of the court shall be excluded in computing the time prescribed by the Limitation Act, 1963, for the commencement of the proceedings with respect to the dispute soc submitted. If the period between the commencement of the arbitration proceedings till the award is set aside by the court, has to be excluded in computing the period of limitation provided for any proceedings with respect o the dispute, there is no good reason as to why it should not be held that the to provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act would be applicable to an application submitted under Section 34 of the Act of 1996, more particularly d where no provision is to be found in the Act of 1996, which excludes the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, to an application made under Section 34 of the Act. It is to be noticed that the powers under Section 34 of the Act can be exercised by the court only if the aggrieved party makes an application. The jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act, cannot be exercised suo motu. The total period of four months within which an application, for setting aside an arbitral award, has to be made is not unusually long. Section 34 of the Act of 1996 would be unduly oppressive, if it is held that the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act are not applicable to it, because cases are no doubt conceivable where an aggrieved party, despite exercise of due diligence and good faith, is unable to make an application within a period of [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1333 Kirpal Singh v. Government of India, New Delhi & Ors. four months. From the scheme and language of Section 34 of the Act of 1996, the intention of the legislature to exclude the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act is not manifest. It is well to remember that Section 14 of the Limitation Act does not provide for a fresh period of limitation but only provides for the exclusion of a certain period. Having regard to the legislative intent, it will have to be held that the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would be applicable to g an application submitted under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 for setting aside an arbitral award.” 7. On the other hand, Mr. Rajat Sangwan, learned counsel appearing for respondent Nos.1 and 2 (National Highway Authority of India) has vehemently contended that the periods of limitation under the Arbitration Act are sacrosanct and these provisions are strictly interpreted by the Courts. He would further submit that, even assuming that Section 14 of the Limitation Act is applicable, the benefit of the said section cannot be extended beyond 20.10.2011. In other words, his submission is that the period commencing from 09.11.2011 to the filing of Section 34 petition being 23.02.2012, should not be condoned.
