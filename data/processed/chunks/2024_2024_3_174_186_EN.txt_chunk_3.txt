The first challenge was that “ghee” is not a “product of livestock” and therefore cannot be regulated and notified. The second ground for challenge was that there is a procedure which is laid down under the law, mainly under Section 3 of the Act which prescribes the process i.e., first a draft notification has to be published, objections are invited against the notification and only after hearing such objections can this notification be made. It was contended that this process has not been followed and therefore the notification is bad. 8. This matter ultimately went to a Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Writ Petition No. 24818 of 2008 titled Kommisetty [2024] 3 S.C.R. 179 Sangam Milk Producer Company Ltd. v. The Agricultural Market Committee & Ors. Nammalwar & Co. Guntur v. Agricultural Market Committee, Tenali & Ors. (2009) SCC OnLine AP 317 and by a 2:1 majority, the Andhra Pradesh High Court rejected the argument of the appellants and upheld the notification of the year 1994, holding that the notification under challenge is not under Section 3 but under Section 4 of the Act, and is valid and moreover “ghee” is a livestock product. Based on the said the Writ Petitions filed by the appellants in Civil Appeal Nos. 6493 of 2014 (M/s Guntur District Milk Production2), 6494 of 2014 (M/s. Lakshmi Das Premji Ghee Merchants), 6496 of 2014 (M/s Durga Dairy Ltd.), 6497 of 2014 (The Krishna District Milk Producers Co-operative Union Ltd., Vijaywada) & 6498 of 2014 (M/s. Karnataka Co-operative Milk Producers Federation Limited) were also dismissed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The decision of the Full Bench in Kommisetty Nammalwar (supra) upholding the validity of the 1994 notification is also under challenge before us in C.A No.6495 of 2014. 9. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and have perused the material on record. 10. The argument that “ghee” is not a product of livestock is baseless, and bereft of any logic. The contrary argument that “ghee” is indeed a product of livestock is logically sound. Livestock has been defined under Section 2(v) of the Act, where Cows and buffalos are the livestock. Undisputedly, “ghee” is a product of milk which is a product of the livestock. The majority opinion of the Full Bench decision in Kommisetty Nammalwar (supra) while referring to the s of this Court in Park Leather Industry (P) Ltd. v. State of U.P. (2001) 3 SCC 135; Kishan Lal v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1990 SC 2269; Ram Chandra Kailash Kumar v. State of U.P. 1980 Supp (1) SCC 27 and Smt. Sita Devi (Dead) by LRs. v. State of Bihar & Ors. (1995) Supp (1) SCC 670 held that all animal husbandry products would fall within the meaning of ‘products of livestock’ as defined under Section 2 (xv) of the Act. Further, the majority decision has also held that the inclusion of “ghee” as a livestock product cannot be faulted merely because it is derived from another dairy product.
