Since it is a ground specific to each property, the High Court was wrong to grant the benefit en masse and quash the entire declaration issued under Section 6 of the 1894 Act.15 24. It may be noted at this stage that the respondents in Civil Appeals No. 8055, 8056, 8058, 8059, 8060, and 8062 of 2019 have not been able to demonstrate that they ever filed objections under Section 5A of the Act. In most instances, the objections have not been produced, and the respondents have mentioned inconsistent dates of their filing. Further, while objections have been produced in Civil Appeal No. 8058 and 8059 of 2019, they precede the date of publication of the notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act. Since these respondents could not show as to how they became aware of the acquisition proceedings, more so when NOIDA has cogently contested the veracity of such objections, we find it difficult to accept the respondents’ stance with reference to the issue discussed hereinabove. D.1.2. Locus of the Respondents who are subsequent purchasers 25. The second sub-issue regarding maintainability of the respondents’ claim stems from the fact that a few of them are stated to have purchased their lands after the notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act was issued. The short question that falls for consideration 15 Delhi Admn. v. Gurdip Singh Uban (2000) 7 SCC 296, para 53 and 54; Abhey Ram v. Union of India (1997) 5 SCC 421, para 13; V. Chandrasekaran v. Administrative Officer (2012) 12 SCC 133, para 24 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1019 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. Darshan Lal Bohra & Ors. is whether such landowners have locus standi to seek abrogation of the acquisition proceedings. 26. This issue is no longer res-integra. This Court has, in a wide range of judicial pronouncements, held that the notification issued under Section 4 of the 1894 Act creates an impediment on the transfer of title in a property.16 The subsequent purchasers do not acquire an unencumbered title over the property and they deliberately run the risk of securing a defective title. The axiom that ‘a public right cannot be altered by the agreement of private persons’, will thus clog their right to raise objection against the acquisition. 27. We may usefully cite Rajasthan State Industrial Development & Investment Corpn. v. Subhash Sindhi Coop. Housing Society,17 in this context which summed up the past precedents observing that: “13. There can be no quarrel with respect to the settled legal proposition that a purchaser, subsequent to the issuance of a Section 4 notification in respect of the land, cannot challenge the acquisition proceedings, and can only claim compensation as the sale transaction in such a situation is void qua the Government. Any such encumbrance created by the owner, or any transfer of the land in question, that is made after the issuance of such a notification, would be deemed to be void and would not be binding on the Government.
