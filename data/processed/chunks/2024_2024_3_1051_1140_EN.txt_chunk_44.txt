The High Court held [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1117 Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. that the time-period under Section 55 of the Ports Act would only apply to a case where payment and overcharging would synchronize i.e., on the facts and circumstances as prevailing on the date of payment, the sum should be an overcharge. The relevant observations read as under: - “5. Because of the inordinate delay [in] the release of the said goods after completing all Customs formalities, the said goods suffered heavy demurrage charges. Accordingly the petitioner represented before the Customs authorities for allowing warehousing of the said goods, pending completion of the Customs formalities [...] 7. Due to the aforesaid delay in allowing clearance of the said goods by the Customs authorities, the said goods incurred heavy demurrage due to no fault of the petitioner. In the circumstances, the petitioner prayed before the Customs authorities for issuance of necessary wharf rent exemption certificate in to enable the petitioner to clear the consignment without payment of demurrages from the Port authorities. After several reminders on or about March 25, 1985 the Customs authorities handed over a wharf rent exemption certificate dated March 23, 1985 to the petitioner covering part of the period of detention, that is from November 28, 1984 to March 1, 1985 in respect of consignment arrived per Vessel “Batara Dua” and from January 22, 1985 to March 1, 1985 in respect of the consignments arrived per vessel “Vishwa Yash”. 8. Thereupon the petitioner again requested the Customs authorities for issuance of wharf rent exemption certificate for the entire period of detention, that is, upto March 25, 1985. Meanwhile, however, as the goods were continuing to incur demurrage, the petitioner had no other alternative but to make payment of the demurrage charges to the Port authorities under protest and take clearance of the said goods. In respect of the said consignments, the 1118 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports petitioner paid a total sum of Rs. 8,43,995 as purported demurrage charges for the period November 28, 1984 to March 25, 1985 in respect of vessel “Batara Dua” and for the period January 15, 1985 to March 25, 1985 in respect of vessel “Vishwa Yash”. 9. Thereafter, on or about February 3, 1986 the Customs authorities issued another wharf rent exemption certificate for the uncovered period from March 2, 1985 to March 25, 1985 in respect of the said goods. 10. In the premises, by a letter dated 15th February, 1986, the petitioner filed an application before the Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer, Post and Railway Audit Section, Calcutta Port Trust enclosing therewith the bills issued by the Port Trust authorities levying and realising demurrage charges as also the said wharf rent exemption certificates. By the said application the petitioner claimed refund for the sum of Rs. 8,43,995 paid by him under protest as aforesaid as purported demurrage/wharf rent charges. The petitioner drew the attention of the said Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer to the fact that in view of the said Wharf Rent Exemption Certificate the petitioner was not/could not be made, liable for payment of the said demurrage/wharf rent charges.
