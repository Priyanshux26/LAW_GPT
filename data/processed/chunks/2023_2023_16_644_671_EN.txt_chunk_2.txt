However, in appeal, the High Court of Andhra Pradesh held against Nalini Kanth, vide dated 11.12.2006, and allowed Appeal Suit No. 2695 of 1989 fi led by Gainedi Kaliprasad, Venkubayamma’s grandson through her deceased daughter, Varalaxmi. Hence, this appeal by Nalini Kanth. 2. Nalini Kanth’s prayer in O.S. No. 113 of 1983 before the learned Principal Subordinate Judge, Srikakulam, fi led through his guardian, was for declaration of his title to the suit properties that had belonged to 648 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. Venkubayamma and for recovery of their possession from Kaliprasad, defendant No.1. His case was that he was adopted by Venkubayamma on 18.04.1982 at Sri Sri Raghunadha Swamy Temple at Bhapur in Berhampur City, Ganjam District, Orissa (presently, Odisha). It was claimed that the Adoption Deed (Ex. A9) was executed on 20.04.1982 and it was registered on the same day. It was signed by his natural parents who gave him in adoption and also by his adoptive mother. Thereafter, Venkubayamma executed registered Will Deed dated 03.05.1982 (Ex. A10) in a sound state of mind bequeathing all her properties to him. Thereby, Venkubayamma also canceled her earlier Will Deed dated 26.05.1981 (Ex. A19), executed in favour of Kaliprasad, her grandson. Under Ex. A10 Will, Venkubayamma appointed Pasupuleti Anasuya (PW 1) as the executor of the Will and also as the guardian of Nalini Kanth, in the event she died during his minority. In fact, Venkubayamma died just two months later, on 26.07.1982. Defendants No. 2 to 12 in the suit were Venkubayamma’s tenants.
