We have seen how, under the Stamp Act, an agreement does not become a contrAct, namely, that it is not C enforceable in law, unless it is duly stamped. Therefore, even a plain reading of Section 11(6-A), when read with Section 7(2) of the 1996 Act and Section 2(h) of the Contract Act, would make it clear that an arbitration clause in an agreement would not exist when it is not enforceable by law. This is also an indicator that SMS Tea Estates has, in no manner, been touched by the D amendment of Section 11(6-A).” 76. The above proposition of law in Garware(supra) appears to be incorrect. As noted earlier, the in SMS Tea(supra) stands legislatively overruled as it was delivered in the pre-2015 amendment regime. Even though there is no express mention in the 246th LCI Report E (supra), the non-obstante clause effectively overrules it. 77. Now let us consider Section 2(g) and 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 which read as under: “(g) An agreement not enforceable by law is said to be void; F (h) An agreement enforceable by law is a contract;” Incorporating the principle in Garware(supra) would mean that as per Section 2(g) and (h) of the Contract Act, 1872, an agreement would be rendered void-ab-initio, if it is not stamped. This would however be contrary to the legislative scheme of the Stamp Act, 1899 G as per which non-stamping/insufficient stamping is a curable defect as discussed earlier. Moreover, stamp duty is levied on the instrument and not the transaction.56 56 Board of Revenue v N. Narasimhan AIR 1961 Mad 504; A. Bapiraju v District Registrar AIR 1968 AP 142 H 466 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A 77.1. In Gulzari Lal Malwari v Ram Gopal57 Lord Williams J while discussing Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899 noted that there is no provision in the Stamp Act, 1899 which renders a document invalid: “There is a clear distinction to be drawn between invalidity and inadmissibility of documents. Certain statutes and sections render B documents invalid if they are not stamped. No section of the Indian Stamp Act has this effect but an instance of a document being rendered invalid by the omission of stamps is contained in the English Stamp Act, s. 93, which provides:— A contract for sea insurance (other than such insurance as is referred to, in the fifty-fifth section of the Merchant Shipping C Act, Amendment Act, 1862) shall not be valid unless the same is expressed in a policy of sea insurance” [emphasis supplied] 77.2. Moreover, the language of Section 11(6A) confines the scope D of enquiry to only “existence.” and not even whether a contract is null and void, as recommended by the 246th LCI Report(supra). The question on validity and existence can be gone into by the arbitrator under Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and not by the Court under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. E J. Interplay between the Stamp Act 1899, Contract Act 1872 and the Arbitration Act, 1996 i) Arbitration Act, 1996 is a special legislation 78.
