There is no right to apply until there is a clear and unequivocal denial of that right by the respondent. It must, therefore, be clear that the claim for arbitration must be raised H 602 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A as soon as the cause for arbitration arises as in the case of cause of action arisen in a civil action. [Paras 54-55 and 57][633-H; 634-C-E; 635-C] Dwijendra Narain Roy v. Joges Chandra De and others, AIR 1924 Cal 600; Mussummat Chand Kour and B Another v. Partab Singh and Others ILR (1889) 16 Cal 98 – referred to. Russell on Arbitration by Anthony Walton (19th Edn.) at pp. 4-5; Law of Arbitration by Justice Bachawat, p. 549 – referred to. C 1.4 Whether any particular facts constitute a cause of action has to be determined with reference to the facts of each case and with reference to, the substance, rather than the form of the action. If an infringement of a right happens at a particular time, the whole cause of action will be said to have arisen then and there. In such a case, it is not open to a party to sit tight and not to file D an application for settlement of dispute of his right, which had been infringed, within the time provided by the Limitation Act, and, allow his right to be extinguished by lapse of time, and thereafter, to wait for another cause of action and then file an application under Section 11 of the Act 1996 for establishment of E his right which was not then alive, and, which had been long extinguished because, in such a case, such an application would mean an application for revival of a right, which had long been extinguished under the Act 1963 and is, therefore, dead for all purposes. Such proceedings would not be maintainable and would obviously be met by the plea of limitation under Article 137 of F the Act 1963. [Para 58][635-D-F] 1.5 The plain reading of the letter dated 24.02.2016 would indicate that the disputes between the parties had cropped up way back in the year 2014 itself. This is evident by the date 24.10.2014 figuring in the aforesaid letter dated 24.02.2016. The G letter indicates that after the disputes arose between the parties, the petitioner tried to offer its explanation and put forward its case vide letter dated 24.10.2014. The respondent by letter dated 24.02.2016 clarified or rather informed the petitioner that the justifications put forward by the petitioner vide its letter dated H 24.10.2014 were duly considered and thereafter, a final decision M/S B AND T AG v. MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 603 was taken for encashment of the liquidated damages. Therefore, A the petitioner is not justified in saying that it continued to negotiate till 2019. The mere bald assertion in this regard is not sufficient. The entire history of the negotiation between the parties must be specifically pleaded and placed on record. It is only after the entire history of negotiation is pleaded and placed B on record that the Court would be in a position to consider such history so as to find out what was the “Breaking Point” at which any reasonable party would have abandoned efforts at arriving at a settlement and contemplated referral of the dispute for arbitration.
