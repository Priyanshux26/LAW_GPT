These issues, we are afraid, do not arise out of the writ petition which has become infructuous on Karapurkar Committee and Sawant Committee having submitted their reports. In case, the petitioner has any further relief to seek, it may, in accordance with law, file a fresh substantive petition before an appropriate forum which would be considered on its own merits”. 8. As a result of the dated 10.02.2006, the present appellant i.e., Goa Foundation, filed Writ Petition No.334 of 2006 for directions to the State Government of Goa to complete the process of identification of forest and to identify the degraded forest lands in accordance with this Court’s dated 12.12.1996. 8 Under the Chairmanship of Dr. H. Karapurkar on 04.09.2000. 9 Goa foundation v. State Government of Goa. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 711 T. N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India and Others 9. The State Government appointed two new Committees10 to identify the remaining areas of private forests in North and South Goa districts that had not been identified by the previous Committee(s). The criteria used by these Committees to identify private forest were same as adopted earlier. 10. Further, the Appellant filed another Writ Petition being W.P. No.495 of 2010 before the High Court of Bombay, seeking the quashing of criteria pertaining to the canopy density which should not be less than 0.4. It was the Appellant’s case that the non-consideration of forest areas having canopy density of 0.1-0.4 (10-40%) was contrary to the criteria allegedly accepted by this Court in the dated 28.03.200811. Hence, appellant claimed that category of open forest or degraded forest having canopy density of 10-40% were totally omitted from the identification process. Subsequently the petition was amended and the criteria of minimum 5 (five) Hectare was also challenged in view of the affidavit filed by the Forest Survey of India12 wherein the forest cover was defined as being “all lands more than 1 ha in area, with tree canopy density of more than 10% irrespective of ownership and legal status”. Meanwhile, by a notification dated 27.11.2012, the State of Goa again constituted two Committees13 to identify the balance areas of private forests that had not been covered by the previous Committees. The criteria for identification of forest lands were same as followed earlier. 11. The Bombay High Court vide dated 17.10.2013 transferred both the Writ Petitions14 to the NGT which were renumbered as Application No.14 (THC) of 201315 and Application No.16 (THC) of 201316. The NGT by the impugned has set aside both the applications and hence the appellant is before this Court. 10 The North Goa District Committee headed by K.G.
