Ahuja vs. V.K. Vora and another8. 8 [2009] 9 SCR 1144 : (2009) 10 SCC 48 658 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 14. In the case of State of NCT of Delhi through Prosecuting Officer, Insecticides, Government of NCT, Delhi vs. Rajiv Khurana9, this Court reiterated the position thus: “17. The ratio of all these cases is that the complainant is required to state in the complaint how a Director who is sought to be made an accused, was in charge of the business of the company or responsible for the conduct of the company’s business. Every Director need not be and is not in charge of the business of the company. If that is the position with regard to a Director, it is needless to emphasise that in the case of non-Director officers, it is all the more necessary to state what were his duties and responsibilities in the conduct of business of the company and how and in what manner he is responsible or liable.” 15. In the case of Ashoke Mal Bafna (supra), this Court observed thus: “9. To fasten vicarious liability under Section 141 of the Act on a person, the law is well settled by this Court in a catena of cases that the complainant should specifically show as to how and in what manner the accused was responsible. Simply because a person is a Director of a defaulter Company, does not make him liable under the Act. Time and again, it has been asserted by this Court that only the person who was at the helm of affairs of the Company and in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business at the time of commission of an offence will be liable for criminal action. (See Pooja Ravinder Devidasani v. State of Maharashtra [Pooja Ravinder Devidasani v. State of Maharashtra, (2014) 16 SCC 1 : (2015) 3 SCC (Civ) 384 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 378 : AIR 2015 SC 675].) 10. In other words, the law laid down by this Court is that for making a Director of a Company liable for the offences committed by the Company under Section 141 of the Act, there must be specific averments against the Director showing as to how and in what manner the 9 [2010] 9 SCR 387 : (2010) 11 SCC 469 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 659 Susela Padmavathy Amma v. M/S Bharti Airtel Limited Director was responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company.” 16. A similar view has been taken by this Court in the case of Lalankumar Singh and others vs. State of Maharashtra10 to which one of us (B.R. Gavai, J.) was a party. 17. In the light of this settled legal position, let us examine the averments made in the complaints. 18. It will be relevant to refer to para 16 of the complaint bearing No. CC 3151/2017 filed by the respondent before the Court of XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai dated 30th November 2016, which reads thus: “16.
