IL& FS made representation before the learned 103 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. judge on 28.08.2019. A letter dated 03.09.2019 was sent by the HDFC reiterating that monies in the escrow account were its exclusive property and that IL&FS could not claim ownership over such property. The Escrow Bank wrote on 04.09.2019 to IL&FS that it had acted in terms of Escrow Agreement and was obliged to hold the money lying in trust for the purpose for which it was received i.e. for the benefi t of HDFC. Former judge of this court issued a show-cause notice dated 30.09.2019 to the HDFC and issued a notice to the Escrow Bank on 10.10.2019.

Former judge of this court granted a personal hearing to the parties.

On 03.07.2020, former judge of this court issued a fi nal holding that the actions of the HDFC and Escrow Bank in debiting the amount from the Escrow Account violated the s passed by NCLAT and thus HDFC and the Escrow Bank were directed to purge themselves within two weeks. 7.
