8. The High Court, in its findings, held that lodging false complaints against a spouse amounts to mental cruelty. In this case, the wife had filed a criminal complaint alleging dowry harassment against the husband and his family but later abandoned it without pursuing the matter further. The Court inferred that the complaint was baseless and filed with intent to harass, constituting an act of mental cruelty. Furthermore, the Court observed that the couple had been living separately for over fifteen years by then, which demonstrated an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. Drawing from s of this Court in Naveen Kohli vs. Neelu Kohli,1 and Samar Ghosh vs. Jaya Ghosh,2 the High Court noted that such prolonged separation indicates that the marital relationship is beyond repair and forcing the parties to remain in a dead marriage would be neither just nor beneficial. Additionally, the High Court concluded that the appellant’s act of leaving the matrimonial home without reasonable cause, coupled with her lack of interest in reconciliation, amounted to desertion. 9. The High Court extensively analyzed the principles laid down by this Court, particularly in the case of Samar Ghosh (Supra), which 1 [2006] 3 SCR 53 : (2006) 4 SCC 558 2 [2007] 4 SCR 428 : (2007) 4 SCC 511 760 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports provides illustrative examples of mental cruelty. These principles emphasize that mental cruelty is a subjective state of mind caused by prolonged anguish, frustration, and emotional turmoil, which renders it unreasonable for spouses to cohabit. 10. The High Court observed that the appellant had filed a false criminal complaint accusing the respondent and his family of dowry harassment. However, the appellant neither pursued the complaint nor provided reasonable justification for her actions. Her conduct demonstrated malice and intent to harass, causing mental agony to the respondent and his family. The High Court inferred that this amounted to mental cruelty, as the complaint disrupted the matrimonial harmony and caused significant emotional distress to the respondent. 11. The High Court also addressed the respondent’s claim of desertion. The appellant had been living separately from the respondent for over fifteen years without valid reasons or attempts at reconciliation. Although she filed a counterclaim seeking restitution of conjugal rights, she failed to actively pursue it, revealing lack of genuine intent to resume marital cohabitation. Prolonged separation, coupled with absence of any reasonable explanation, demonstrated the appellant’s intention to permanently withdraw from the marital relationship. The High Court held that this constituted desertion under the principles established by this Court, which define desertion as the willful and permanent abandonment of matrimonial obligations without consent of the other spouse. 12. The High Court also relied on precedents wherein this Court had held that filing false criminal complaints and leveling unsubstantiated allegations amounts to mental cruelty. It emphasized that false accusations erode trust and affection, irreparably damaging marital bond. Additionally, the High Court observed that the appellant’s behavior caused an irreparable rift between the parties, rendering their marriage broken beyond repair.
