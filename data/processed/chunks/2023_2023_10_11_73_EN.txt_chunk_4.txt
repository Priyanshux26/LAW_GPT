Such a reasoning was a huge climbdown from the original charge that A-1 to A-7 entered into E a criminal conspiracy, to cause wrongful loss to PSU and to confer a wrongful gain to A-5 to A-7. Once an offence of Section 120B is not made out against A-5 to A-7, the very foundation for the prosecution becomes shaky. Therefore, the conviction of A-1 for the offences under Section 120B read with Sections 420, 468, F Section 471 read with Section 468 and Section 193 IPC and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act cannot be sustained. [Para 103][65-C-E] 4.3 A-1 was found guilty of an offence under Section 193. Section 193 applies only to false evidence given in any stage of a G judicial proceeding or the fabrication of false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial proceeding. The allegation against A-1 was not even remotely linked to any of the Explanations under Section 193 of the IPC. Therefore, the of the trial court and that of the High Court convicting H A. SRINIVASULU v. THE STATE REP. BY THE INSPECTOR OF 17 POLICE A-1 for the said offences and sentencing him to imprisonment of A varying terms and fines of different amounts are liable to be reversed. [Para 104][65-F-G] 4.4 No Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under Section 193 IPC, except on a complaint in writing of that Court or of some other Court to which that Court is subordinate. B This bar is found in Section 195(1)(b)(i) of the Code. No complaint was ever made by any Court or by any officer authorized by any Court that A-1 or A-3 or A-4 committed an offence punishable under Section 193 IPC. But unfortunately, the trial court convicted A-1, A-3 and A-4, of the offence under Section 193 C without any application of mind and the same has been upheld by the High Court. [Para 108][66-E, F] 4.5 The reading of the trial court and the High Court as though this Committee of which A-3, A-4 and the Approver were a part, was actually a Tender Committee having a larger role to D play, is completely misconceived. In fact, the prosecution had to stand or fall on the strength of the testimony of the Approver namely PW-16. Despite the assertion on the part of PW-16 giving a clean chit to A-3 and A-4, the trial court found both of them guilty on a convoluted logic that they were part of a Tender Committee and that “every word and every description in the E Tender Committee proceedings had been written by them with a view to cheat PSU” and that “if A-3 and A-4 were innocent they should have questioned and asked for details regarding the contractors.” Such a reasoning given by the trial court and approved by the trial court and approved by the High Court was F completely perverse. [Paras 110-112][64-D, E; 68-A, B] 4.6 A-4 had no role in choosing the tenderers, but entered the picture only after the offers were received from the tenderers.
