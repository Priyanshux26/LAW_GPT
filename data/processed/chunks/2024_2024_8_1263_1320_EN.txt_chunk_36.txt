As for Rule 48 falling under Part III Schedule 2 of the IT Act, it contemplates attachment of an immovable property of the defaulter, prohibiting the defaulter from transferring/ charging the property and prohibiting all other persons from taking benefit from such a transfer/charge. 36.7 The sequence of the events as unravelled from the records reveal that the Income Tax Department had already filed a claim before the Liquidator who had in turn moved the Adjudicating Authority for appropriate directions relating to the subject property that was under the attachment passed by the Income Tax Authorities. The said application was disposed of by the Adjudicating Authority vide dated 10th February, 2020 wherein, directions were issued to lift the attachment subject to the conditions that may be specified in an Escrow 1316 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports account where the sale consideration would be deposited by the Liquidator. The said passed in open Court was duly conveyed by the Liquidator to the Auction Purchaser, though it is the stand of the latter that a physical copy of the said passed on 10th February, 2020, was received by it much later, in the month of May, 2020. The escrow account55 was created on 3rd August, 2020 and the entire tax arrears amounting to ₹2,44,01,603/- (Rupees Two crore forty four lakhs one thousand six hundred and three only) were deposited in the escrow account on 24th August, 2020, though the income tax department lifted the attachment three days later, on 27th August, 2020. This was duly conveyed to the office of the Sub-Registrar at Trichy on the same date. The second proviso to Section 281 of the IT Act did provide a window to the Auction Purchaser to approach the assessing officer for prior permission to transfer the subject property. But that option was exercised when the Liquidator moved an application for appropriate permission before the Adjudicating Authority which was granted on 10th February, 2020 under intimation to the Auction Purchaser. 36.8 The contention of the learned counsel for the Auction Purchaser is that Rule 13, Schedule I of the IBBI Regulation, 2016 must be read in conjunction with Rule 12 and only on payment of the full amount, could the sale transaction be treated to have been completed in all respects. Since the full amount could not be paid till the attachment was lifted, the Liquidator could not have executed a certificate for sale/sale deed to transfer the subject property in favour of the Auction Purchaser. 36.9 We are afraid, such an assumption does not stand to reason. Rule 12 is not interlinked with Rule 13. Both the Rules cover different situations. The first proviso to Rule 12 gives a leeway to the successful bidder to make payment of the balance sale consideration after thirty days subject to paying interest at the rate of 12%. However, the second proviso to Rule 12 is unequivocal and declares that the sale itself will be treated as 55 Escrow Account No. 50200050623451 [2024] 8 S.C.R.
