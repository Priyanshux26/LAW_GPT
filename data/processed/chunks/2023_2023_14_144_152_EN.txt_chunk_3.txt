The matter was considered by the Chief Engineer and disposed of vide dated 14.03.2005. While considering the representations and referring to the relevant Rules, the Chief Engineer directed that K.K. Subramanian, K.S. Badarudeen, M.K.Raghavan, K.Sureshan, C.Satheesan and K.K. Chandrababu be granted promotion as Assistant Engineers with eff ect from 01.08.1993. However, it was clarifi ed that they will not be paid any arrears on account of date of re-assignment of date of promotion, though they will be eligible for fi xation of pay. 8. It was further argued that the private respondents knew that with the passed in the aforesaid writ petition fi led by them, the appellant will be adversely aff ected, hence, they had impleaded him as a party but the 6 Writ Petition (Civil) No. 37212 of 2004- (E) (M.K. Raghavan, Assistant Engineer III vs. State of Kerala)Decided on 21.12.2004. C. ANIL CHANDRAN v. M.K. RAGHAVAN AND OTHERS 149 [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] fact remains that he was never served with any notice of the writ petition. Before even re-assigning the date of promotion of the private-respondents from a back date, which had adversely aff ected the chances of promotion of the appellant, he was not aff orded any opportunity of hearing by the Chief Engineer. 9. Immediately after the appellant came to know about the passing of the aforesaid dated 14.03.2005, he fi led a writ petition6 before the High Court challenging the aforesaid . The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition opining that the seniority list of the Assistant Engineer, as was circulated on 22.11.2001, was the fi nal seniority list, which was never challenged by the private-respondents 1 to 4, 7 and 8. The same could not have been reopened to the prejudice of the appellant without even notice to him. Hence, the same was set aside and a direction was issued for re- assigning the seniority to the appellant. 10. Aggrieved by the aforesaid passed by the learned Single Judge, the respondents No.1 to 4 preferred writ appeal. The same was allowed by the Division Bench of the High Court holding that with anti- dating of the promotion of the private respondents from diff erent dates in the year 1995, to 01.08.1993, the appellant was not adversely aff ected. The passed by the learned Single Judge was set aside by the Division Bench. The of the Chief Engineer dated 14.03.2005 was restored. It is the aforesaid which is impugned in the present appeal. 11. In the aforesaid factual matrix narrated by learned counsel for the petitioner, the contention is that the private respondents never fi led any objections to the seniority list of Assistant Engineers as circulated 2-3 times between 1996-1997. When the fi nal seniority list was circulated on 22.11.2001, even then the same was not challenged within a reasonable time. The issue was sought to be raised more than three years later. That too by challenging the fi nal seniority list, when service records of the eligible candidates for promotion from the post of Assistant Engineer to Executive Engineer was called for.
