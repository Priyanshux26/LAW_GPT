The appellant fi led a complaint before the Commission seeking compensation of ₹ 95,03,00,000 (₹95 crores 3 lakhs) plus litigation expenses of ₹ 10,000 per hearing and suitable pecuniary punishment to the delinquent offi cers. II. Commission’s Findings 15. The Commission dismissed the appellant’s complaint and observed that no expert opinion was adduced or proved before it for establishing medical negligence during the blood transfusion against the respondent/ opposite parties. It was also observed that no reason existed for the opposite parties to deny sharing of the appellant’s medical records, and in fact, the discharge certifi cate, when found was duly supplied to the appellant. 16. The Commission also relied on provisions of Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct Etiquettes and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 (hereafter “IMC Professional Conduct Regulations”)10 to observe that the hospital facility was not bound to preserve the appellant’s medical records beyond the period of three years and thus there is no reason to believe that the authorities deliberately denied the appellant’s medical records to him. The Commission also relied on the blood test report dated 05.03.2014 to hold that the appellant was not infected at the 171 Military Hospital, Samba, while denying the Medical Board’s opinion dated 12.12.2014 and 24.06.2015 and a letter dated 14.12.2016 (as the same were not based on any evidence) and thus, no negligence was attributable to the respondents. Aggrieved by the fi ndings of the Commission, the appellant has preferred an appeal before this court. 10 Clause 1.3.1 of Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct Etiquettes and Ethics) Regulations, 2002. 614 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. III. Proceedings in the present appeal 17. This court by an dated 08.04.2022, considering the nature of the controversy involved in the impugned case, appointed Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned senior counsel and Ms. Vanshaja Shukla, as amici curiae to appear on behalf of the appellant and assist the court. 18. By a letter dated 25.04.2022, this court directed the respondents to submit the entire record pertaining to transfusion of blood on 10.07.2002 to the appellant. As a consequence, 171 MH and 166 MH again searched their records and by letter dated 14.06.2022 and 13.06.2022 (from 171 MH and 166 MH respectively), submitted that they were unable to detect the appellant’s medical records as they were destroyed in compliance with the policy of destruction of old documents. IV. Submissions by the Appellant 19. The amici and the appellant argued that it is the onus of the respondents to establish that the two armed forces (Indian Army and IAF) were not negligent, because of the direct acts of their doctors and the hospital. Reference to a letter dated 12.06.2018 was made in which the Respondent No 1 admitted in writing that 171 MH was not authorized to operate any blood bank and therefore, no pathologist was authorized or appointed at the facility. The appellant also referred to an RTI reply11 stating that “there was no transfusion medicine expert (doctor) available and no blood grouping and cross-matching test report is available”.
