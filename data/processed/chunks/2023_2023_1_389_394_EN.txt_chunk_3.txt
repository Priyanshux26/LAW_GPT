Applying the law laid down by this Court in the case of Indore D Development Authority (supra) to the facts of the case on hand and the stand taken by the DDA in the counter filed before the High Court, the impugned and passed by the High Court is unsustainable. 4.1 At this stage, it is required to be noted that the High Court was E conscious of the fact that the actual physical possession is not capable of being taken due to illegal occupation by the encroachers. Though, the High Court has granted the declaration that the acquisition proceedings with respect to the subject lands are deemed to have lapsed, the High Court has observed that the original writ petitioner would only be entitled to compensation as per Act, 2013. F 4.2 As observed and held hereinabove, the original writ petitioner shall not be entitled to the relief of declaration of lapsing of the acquisition proceedings. Once that be so, there is no question of payment of any compensation to the original writ petitioner as per the Act, 2013. Under the circumstances also, the impugned and passed by the G High Court is unsustainable. 5. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, present appeal succeeds.
