These were requests for starting an enquiry, which obviously did not commence prior to the aforesaid dates in the year 2021. Thus, on this point I cannot accept the finding of the High Court that a regular enquiry was already initiated on 05.06.2018. The restriction in Section 17A of the 1988 Act is on conducting an enquiry by a police officer without the prior approval of the authority specified therein. A request to conduct an enquiry by itself cannot be the starting point of the enquiry under the said provision to bypass the restriction postulated therein. Moreover, in the facts of this case, actual search for information had commenced in the year 2021, as I have already indicated, and lack of action on this count has been attributed by the State to the appellant and the other accused persons themselves. We are not going into the truth of such allegations. But if such allegations are assumed to be correct, the same shall only support the appellant’s case that no enquiry was initiated before incorporation of Section 17A in the statute book. Further, in the F.I.R. or the preliminary enquiry report dated 09.12.2021, there was no reference to the communication of 05.06.2018. I, accordingly, hold that before Section 17A of the 1988 Act had become operational, no enquiry, inquiry or investigation had commenced as against the appellant in relation to the subject crime. 14. Mr. Salve has also relied on a Standard Operating Procedure (hereinafter referred to as “SOP”) for processing cases under Section 17A of the 1988 Act. This has been issued under Memo no.428/07/2021-AVD.IV(B) dated 03.09.2021 by the Department of Personnel and Training of the Government of India. This memo in detail records how the aforesaid provisions shall apply. Clause 4.2 thereof stipulates: - “Enquiry for the purposes of these SOPs, means any action taken, for verifying as to whether the information pertains to commission of offence under the Act.” [2024] 1 S.C.R. 563 Nara Chandrababu Naidu v. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr. 15. As there is no authoritative guideline defining what constitutes an enquiry, I find it safe to rely on the explanation given in the aforesaid clause of the SOP. This explanation also contemplates any action taken for verifying as to whether the information pertains to commission of offences under the Act or not. Again, the memo of 05.06.2018, if tested standalone, cannot be construed to imply taking any action. 16. The High Court citing the s of this Court in the cases of Shambhoo Nath Misra -vs- State of U.P. & Others [(1997) 5 SCC 326] and State of Uttar Pradesh -vs- Paras Nath Singh [(2009) 6 SCC 372], has held that the protection of sanction sought by the accused persons therein cannot be applied because when a public servant is alleged to have committed the offence of fabrication of records or misappropriation of public funds, it cannot be said that he acted in discharge of his official duty. Obviously, it cannot be said that such misdemeanour on the part of a public servant can be equated to his official duties.
