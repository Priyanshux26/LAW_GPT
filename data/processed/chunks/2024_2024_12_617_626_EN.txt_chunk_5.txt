The circular dated 29th March, 2003 issued by the Government of Karnataka specifically extended protection to various castes, including those which were excluded in the earlier Government circular dated 11th March, 2002. This subsequent circular covered the castes such as Kotegara, Kotekshathriya, Koteyava, Koteyar, Ramakshathriya, Sherugara and Sarvegara, thus, ensuring that individuals of these castes, holding Scheduled Castes certificates issued prior to de-scheduling, would be entitled to claim protection of their services albeit as unreserved candidates for all future purposes. Additionally, the communication issued by the Ministry of Finance dated 17th August, 2005 reinforced the protective umbrella to the concerned bank employees and also saved them from departmental and criminal action.” 3 2024 INSC 634 : [2024] 8 SCR 868 4 [2000] Supp. 5 SCR 65 : (2001) 1 SCC 4 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 625 Union of India & Ors. v. Rohit Nandan 12. Having considered the matter in detail, we are of the opinion that after the decision of this Court in the case of Bhim Rao Ambedkar (supra), the issue of the appellant claiming reservation as Scheduled Caste candidate does not subsist. As indicated earlier, it is not even the argument of the respondent that the said will not apply. 13. The decisions of this Court in Bhim Rao Ambedkar (supra) and in K. Nirmala (supra) exercising equity jurisdiction stand on a different footing and they can be distinguished on facts. Those s dealt with long standing appointments, continued over a period of time, because of which court felt, on equitable considerations, not to disturb the employment of the appellants therein. The facts in this case are completely different and the following will clarify the position. 14. The respondent was in service of the Union on the basis of reservation claimed by him as an OBC candidate. It was only on 02.07.2015 that the State Government issued a notification shifting the caste Tanti from the OBC to that of Scheduled Caste and the necessary change in the service record was brought only on 17.08.2018. In the meanwhile, an advertisement was issued on 07.10.2016 for a Limited Departmental Competitive Examination, and the respondent applied as a Scheduled Caste candidate. 15. When the Government refused appointment to the respondent to the post as he does not belong to Scheduled Caste, he approached the Tribunal and filed an Original Application which came to be dismissed on 01.04.2022. However, the respondent’s writ petition was allowed by the High Court only on 19.01.2023. We are informed that during the pendency of the matter before this Court, the respondent was appointed to the said promotional post only on 14.12.2023. Even assuming that the respondent was given benefit of his illegal categorisation as a Scheduled Caste candidate, the benefit that accrued to him was for a short period of less than a year and that too during the pendency of this appeal. Therefore, there are no equities in favour of the respondent like that of the candidates in the case of Bhim Rao Ambedkar or K. Nirmala (supra).
