The appeal arises from the dated 15 January 2024 of the High Court of Delhi by which a petition under article 226 was dismissed on grounds of maintainability. A. Factual Background 4. The appellant addressed a legal notice to the first respondent, Sony Pictures, on 6 October 2023 raising objections to the trailer of their film. The appellant was particularly aggrieved by the introduction of some of the characters of the film, who were portrayed to suffer from physical impairments. Sony Pictures replied to the notice on 17 October 2023. The movie was released on 3 November 2023 with ‘U’ certification from the Central Board of Film Certification. 5. The appellant claims that the film violates the constitutionally protected rights of persons with disabilities; and the provisions of the Cinematograph Act, 19521 and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 20162. The appellant claims that the Central Board 1 “Cinematograph Act” 2 “RPwD Act” [2024] 7 S.C.R. 257 Nipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors. of Film Certification3 has violated its statutory duty to certify films in accordance with the applicable guidelines. 6. He therefore sought directions: (i) Mandating the inclusion of an expert on disability within the Central Board of Film Certification and its advisory panel constituted under Sections 3 and 5 of the Cinematograph Act; (ii) Mandating the inclusion of the expert under Section 3 of the Cinematograph Act, 1952; (iii) Seeking relief against the first respondent, including punitive damages; and (iv) A public apology from the first respondent. 7. The appellant has highlighted instances in the trailer as well as the film where certain medical conditions have been misrepresented and derogatory terms have been used for characters who are persons with disabilities. These include (a) misrepresentation of the condition of night blindness; and (b) derogatory references to (i) a person with Alzheimer’s as “bhulakkad baap”, (ii) a hearing-impaired person as a “soundproof system”; and (iii) a character with speech impairment as an “atki hui cassette”.
