Digital Supreme Court Reports 33. We have also heard Ms. Mrinal Gopal Elker, learned counsel for the respondent-State of M.P. and Mr. Avadhesh Kumar Singh, learned counsel for respondent No. 4 – Archana Mishra and the parties who have filed applications for impleadment. Though no formal s of impleadment were made, arguments were heard on the application. They contend that the s of the Collector, revisional authority, learned Single Judge and the Division Bench warranted no interference. They relied on S.K. Sharma (supra) and reiterated the aspect of there being no prejudice due to the non-compliance of the principles of natural justice. They highlighted the fact that even though the appellants received less marks in the basic qualifying examination, they have obtained higher marks in the interview; that relatives have come to be appointed; that there was reasonable likelihood of bias and that the relatives of committee members have obtained higher marks during the interview. They also relied on Section 40(c) and Section 100 of the M.P. Panchayat Raj Avam Gram Swaraj Adhiniyam. They relied on the s of this Court on the aspect of bias and likelihood of bias, among them being, Dr. (Mrs.) Kirti Deshmankar vs. Union of India and Others, (1991) 1 SCC 104, J. Mohapatra and Co. and Another vs. State of Orissa and Another, (1984) 4 SCC 103, Ashok Kumar Yadav and Others vs. State of Haryana and Others, (1985) 4 SCC 417, A.K.
