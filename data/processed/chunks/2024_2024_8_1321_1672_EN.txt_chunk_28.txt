Davinder Singh & Ors. d. States must confer the benefits to members of all the castes notified by the President under Article 341. If the State Government is of the opinion that benefits are not required to be conferred to the caste, then it can make a recommendation for its exclusion from the list of Scheduled Castes; and e. The purpose of conferring Parliament with the power to alter the list issued by the President under Article 321 is to prevent the tinkering of the list for political purposes. 38. Mr Mallela Venkata Rao, counsel submitted that the opinion of Justice SB Sinha in Chinnaiah (supra) that other forms of affirmative action must be employed to remedy inter-se backwardness within the Scheduled Castes is the appropriate and constitutional approach. 39. Mahendra Kumar Mitra, Petitioner-in-person appearing on behalf of Dr. Ambedkar Scheduled Castes Federation, Karnataka submitted that the recommendation of the Justice Usha Mehra Committee to include Clause (3) to Article 341 providing Parliament the power to sub-categorize castes upon a resolution received from the State was not accepted by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.51 40.

Mr Vembadi Subramanian and Mr VK Biju, counsel, made submissions on the same lines.
