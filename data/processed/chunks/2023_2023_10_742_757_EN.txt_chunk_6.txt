The same may be adopted while permitting reduction of load. B (2) Reduction of load requested by the disputant H.T. Consumers may be sent to Headquarters office before processing the same. (3) Request for reduction of load within a period of one year C from the date of earlier reduction may be permitted” 13. A perusal of the record reveals that a request for the reduction of the contracted demand to 10000 KVA was made on 24th December,2001 and thereafter, repeated letters and communications in this regard have been made. Vide letter dated 30th January, 2002 it was informed to the Appellants that the assumption in respect of the reduction D being effectuated from 27th January, 2002 was incorrect and the same would be subject to certain conditions. 14. Further, vide a letter dated 20th May, 2002, a meeting was requested with the concerned authority. Subsequently, conceding to the threat of disconnection of the supply a payment of Rs.78,00,000/- was E made under protest. The said payment was acknowledged vide letter dated 27th May, 2002, and it was stated that the ‘under protest’ nature of the same was not acceptable. It was also informed thereby that a delayed payment surcharge @ 1.5% per month would also be applicable. 15. Revised bills were requested in line with the interim of F the High Court dated 28th November,2002, in terms of letter dated 4th June, 2002, but the same does not appear from the record to have been responded to. 16. The High Court, in appeal, considered at length the various clauses of the agreement to hold that no such right to pay the reduced G amount arose in the absence of such a request being sanctioned by the Board. 17. It is submitted that the unilateral call by the Board not to alter the contract as requested saddles the Appellant with unfair cost. It is then submitted that the Board is bound to grant such permission for H 752 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A reduction so long as the payment as according to Clause 19.02 is being made. 18. As per Clause 13.04 which states that the agreement of supply may be terminated by any consumer by giving one month’s notice, it is urged that the Appellant’s application dated 24th December, 2001 seeking B the reduction to 10000 KVA with effect from 27th January, 2002, must be treated a notice of termination of the agreement with respect to the 13000 KVA that is sought to be reduced. 19. On the basis of certain other instances where similar applications were decided upon within a short period of time, it is C submitted that taking such a large time to deliberate upon the Appellant’s application is arbitrary and unreasonable. 20. The primary thrust of the Respondents’ argument is a clause in the 1999 agreement reproduced Supra. The effect of this Clause, as per the Respondents, is that the request for a reduction in maximum demand as made by the Appellant, does not acquire any status as till the D time such request is processed by the Board, and a decision allowing such reduction is taken.
