Agrawala, Tishampati Sen, Ms. Riddhi Sancheti, Anurag Anand, Ms. Tasmiya Taleha, Advs. for the Respondents. / OF THE SUPREME COURT SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J. 1. The appellants before this Court were the plaintiff s in a civil suit, fi led in the year 2021, seeking declaration that the Conveyance Deed dated 17.12.2019 to be declared null and void, and that the registered Development Agreements dated 17.09.2007, 20.11.2007, 30.11.2007, 03.12.2007 and 27.02.2008 stand validly terminated. The respondents/defendants moved an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as “Arbitration Act”) for referring the matter to arbitration by relying upon the arbitral clause in the two agreements dated 31.03.2007 and 25.07.2008. It was contended that the aforesaid agreements formed the basis of the Conveyance Deed and the Development Agreements which are subject matter of the suit. The Trial Court allowed the application of the defendant and referred the matter for arbitration, vide its dated 13.10.2021. This was challenged in Writ Petition No.8836 of 2021 by the appellants / plaintiff s before the Bombay High Court, which was dismissed vide dated 10.12.2021. Aggrieved by these two s, the appellants / plaintiff s are now before this Court. 2. The only question to be decided by us here is whether the Trial Court and the High Court have rightly referred the matter to arbitration or the dispute is of such a nature that it is not liable to be referred to arbitration, as there was no arbitration clause in the Conveyance Deed dated 17.12.2019 or if there was, yet the matter in any case is such that it is not arbitrable. The brief facts of the case are as follows: 912 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R.
