The appellants filed writ appeals. By the impugned , the appeals were dismissed reiterating the findings of the learned Singe Judge. Contentions: 11. We have heard Mr. Surender Kumar Gupta, learned counsel for the appellants and Ms. Sansriti Pathak, learned counsel for the respondent-State. 12. Learned counsel for the appellants, after placing a comprehensive overview of the facts, vehemently contended that there was no fault on the part of the appellants and for any wrong computation of vacancy, the appellants ought not to be prejudiced. He further contended that the State admittedly does not dispute that two vacancies were, in fact, created and that if at all there was any manipulation, it was at the level of the School. In the absence of any blameworthy conduct attributed to the appellants, they ought not to be prejudiced after serving the School for very long. According to the appellants, they were continuously teaching till 30.03.2016 by entering their names in a separate register. However, according to the State, from October, 2005 their salaries have been stopped. In support of their claim, learned counsel for the appellants relied upon the s of this 26 [2024] 1 S.C.R. DIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS Court in Vikas Pratap Singh and Ors. Vs. State of Chhattisgarh and Ors., (2013) 14 SCC 494 and the recent in Civil Appeal Nos. 6233-34 of 2023 dated 20.11.2023 titled Vivek Kaisth and Anr. Vs. The State of Himachal Pradesh and Ors., 2023:INSC:1007 = 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1485. 13. Ms. Sansriti Pathak, learned counsel for the State vehemently defended the impugned . She contended that where there was fraud, the whole selection process shall be vitiated. She relied on Sachin Kumar and Ors. Vs. Delhi Subordinate Service Selection Board (DSSSB) and Ors. 2021:INSC:147 = 2021 (4) SCC 631 in support of her proposition. Learned counsel submitted that there was no case warranting interference under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. Discussion and Findings: 14. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the matter and considered the submissions of the rival parties and perused the records. The correspondence between the School and the Directorate of Education culminated in the of 26.12.1997. There is a dispute about the number of posts that were sanctioned. According to the State, two posts were, in fact, sanctioned and it was the School that manipulated it, to make it three. We will proceed on the basis that the version of the State is correct. The nominee of the State participated in the selection process. Twelve candidates had applied and ultimately three appellants were empanelled for selection. Due approval was given for the appointment and admittedly they discharged their duties on their post from 25.06.1999 till September, 2005. Even according to the State, admittedly, till date there is no terminating their services. What impelled the appellants to go to the High Court was the stoppage of their salary. 15. There is not an iota of material to demonstrate how the appellants, who were applicants from the open market, were guilty of colluding in the manipulation.
