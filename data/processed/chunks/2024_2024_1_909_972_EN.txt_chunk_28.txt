“13. Gender and number.—In all Central Acts and Regulations, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context,— (1) …………………; and (2) words in the singular shall include the plural, and vice versa.” 86. Apart from that, the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Vivek Narayan Sharma and others v. Union of India and others10 had an occasion to consider the question, as to whether the word “any” would include “all” and vice versa. The Constitution Bench of this Court observed thus: “113. It is strenuously urged by the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners that the word “any” used in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act will have to be given a restricted meaning to mean “some”. It is submitted that if sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act is not read in such manner, the very power available under the said sub-section will have to be held to be invalid on the ground of excessive delegation. It is submitted that it cannot be construed that the legislature intended to bestow uncanalised, unguided and arbitrary power on the Central Government to demonetise the entire currency. It is, therefore, the submission of the petitioners that in to save the said section from being declared void, the word “any” requires to be interpreted in a restricted manner to mean “some”. 114. Per contra, it is submitted on behalf of the respondents that the word “any” under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act, cannot be interpreted in a narrow manner and it will have to be construed to include “all”. Precedents construing the word “any” 115. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar [Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 : AIR 1961 SC 10 [2023] 1 SCR 1 : (2023) 3 SCC 1=2023 INSC 2 952 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 838] was considering the question as to whether the phrase “any one of the Directors” as found in Section 76 of the Mines Act, 1952 could mean “only one of the Directors” or could it be construed to mean “every one of the Directors”. In the said case, all the Directors of the Company were prosecuted for the offences punishable under Sections 73 and 74 of the Mines Act, 1952. The High Court had held [Lala Karam Chand Thapar v. State of Bihar, 1958 SCC OnLine Pat 30] that any “one” of the Directors of the Company could only be prosecuted. 116. The Constitution Bench of this Court observed thus : (Lala Karam Chand Thapar case [Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 : AIR 1961 SC 838], AIR pp. 847-48, paras 29-34) “29. It is quite clear and indeed not disputed that in some contexts, “any one” means “one only it matters not which one” the phrase “any of the Directors” is therefore quite capable of meaning “only one of the Directors, it does not matter which one”.
