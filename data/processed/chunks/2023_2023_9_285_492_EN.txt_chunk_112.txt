Section 45 has been recognized as a provision falling under Part II which is a “complete code”. [See Chloro Controls v Severn Trent Water Purification Inc18] The expression “unless it finds” in Section 45 was interpreted per majority in Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v Aksh Optifibre Ltd19 F (for short “Shin-Etsu) as a consideration on a “prima facie basis” only. In 2019, Parliament amended Section 45. It substituted the expression “unless it finds.” with “unless it prima facie finds”. It thus brings the statute in line with the position settled in Shin Etsu (supra). In this background, the Stamp Act, 1899 merely creates a G temporary infliction till the stamp duty is recovered, with or without penalty (as the case may be). The affliction only attaches to the instrument and not the transaction. 18 (2013) 1 SCC 641 H 19 (2005) 7 SCC 234 M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 435 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] 20.2 The Arbitration Act, 1966 has always been held to be an A exhaustive legislation in the nature of a complete Code. [Paragraphs 83-84, 89 inFuerst Day Lawson Ltd. v. Jindal Exports Ltd.20] According to Mr. Panda, the impounding of the parent instrument that contains the arbitration agreement by a forum that exercises power under the complete Code, either under Section 8, 9 and 11 within Part I, or B under Section 45 within Part-II, is inconsistent with the character of Arbitration Act, 1996 which is in the nature of a complete code. 21. Looking at the respective projection by the learned Amicus Curiae and other counsels, the following questions fall for our consideration: C i) Whether the non-stamping of the substantive contract/ instrument would render the arbitration agreement non- existent in law, void and unenforceable at the stage of Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 for the purpose of referring a matter for arbitration? D ii) Whether the examination of stamping and impounding should be done at the threshold by the Section 11 judge or should it be left to the arbitrator? F. The Statutory framework of the Stamp Act, 1899 22. Let us begin by examining the objective behind the enactment E of the Stamp Act, 1899. The 67th Law Commission Report21 suggests that the idea of a fiscal enactment for the purpose of collecting revenue for the State first originated in Holland and thereafter, the Bengal Regulation 6 of 1797 was enacted in India. This was initially limited to Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Banaras. Subsequently, various stamp F regulations were introduced in Bombay and Madras. The Stamp duties were primarily intended to compensate for the deficiency in public revenue due to abolition of tax for the maintenance of police establishments, leviable on “Indian Merchants and Traders”. However, the Regulation paved way for later enactments relating to stamp duty. In 1860, the first Act relating to Stamp duties was enacted in India. This was repealed by G the Act of 1862, 1869, 1879 and subsequently, the Act of 1899 was enacted which is the current legislation.
