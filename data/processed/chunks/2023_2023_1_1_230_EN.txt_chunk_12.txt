On a close reading of the Notification dated 8th November, 2016, in juxtaposition with the records, the following aspects emerge: H 18 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A i) The proposal for demonetisation originated from the Central Government, by way of its letter addressed th to the Bank, dated 7 November, 2016. This aspect forms the central plank of the controversy at hand. That the recommendation did not originate from the Bank under sub- section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI B Act, but was “obtained” from the Bank in the form of an opinion on the proposal for demonetisation submitted by the Central Government. Such an opinion, could not be considered to be a recommendation as required by the Central C Government in to proceed under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the Act. ii) Even if it is to be assumed for the sake of argument that the said opinion, was in fact a “recommendation” under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, in light D of the interpretation given to the phrase “any” series or “any” denomination, to mean a specified series/ specified denomination, the recommendation itself is void inasmuch as it pertained to demonetisation of “all” series of Bank notes of denominational values of Rs.500/- and Rs.1,000/-.
