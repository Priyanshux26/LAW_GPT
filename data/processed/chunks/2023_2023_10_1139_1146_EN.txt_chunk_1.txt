Hence, there was C no intention on his part to kill the deceased. Whether the appellant had done a cruel act or not, has to be appreciated after considering three facts. Firstly, the appellant was a soldier on guard duty, secondly, the appellant and the deceased had a fight over the seniority and thirdly, though there were 20 rounds in the rifle of the deceased, he fired only one round. The appellant D cannot be said to have acted in such a cruel manner which would deprive him of the benefit of exception 4 to Section 300 IPC. The term cruel manner is a relative term. Exception 4 applies when a man kills another. By ordinary standards, this itself is a cruel act. The appellant fired only one bullet which proved to be E fatal. He did not fire more bullets though available. He did not run away and he helped others to take the deceased to a hospital. If a meaning is assigned to the word ‘cruel’ used in exception 4 which is used in common parlance, in no case exception 4 can be applied. Therefore, exception 4 to Section 300 was applicable in this case. Therefore, the appellant is guilty of culpable homicide F not amounting to murder. The appellant snatched the rifle from the hands of the deceased and fired one bullet at the deceased. This act was done with the intention of causing such bodily injury to the deceased as was likely to cause death. Therefore, the first part of Section 304 IPC would apply. Under the first part of Section G 304 IPC, an accused can be punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years. [Para 11][1145-C-H; 1146-A-D] 1.2 PW-5 and PW-10 admitted that the accused had a ‘nice reputation’. The conduct of the appellant would be a mitigating H NO.15138812Y L/NK GURSEWAK SINGH v. UNION OF INDIA 1141 & ANR. factor for determining the sentence. It is not in dispute that the A appellant has undergone incarceration for a period of 9 years and approximately 3 months. Taking an overall view of the evidence on record, the sentence already undergone by the appellant would be an appropriate sentence in the facts of the case. The conviction of the appellant for the offence punishable u/s. 302 IPC is altered B to the one under Part 1 of Section 304 IPC. The appellant is sentenced to undergo imprisonment for the term which he has already undergone. [Paras 12 and 13][1146-D-G] Prakash Chand v. State of H.P. (2004) 11 SCC 381 : [2004] 3 Suppl.
