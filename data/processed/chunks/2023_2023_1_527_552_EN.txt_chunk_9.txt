2-6 as there is no concept of ‘persons acting in concert’ under the said Regulations; (vi) under section 111A (3), the Tribunal has no power to annul the transfer or to direct the buy-back of the shares. G 15. Having heard both sides, we formulate the following questions for our consideration. 12 hereinafter referred to as ‘the SEBI Act’. 13 (1977) 2 SCC 424 H 14 (2006) 5 SCC 361 IFB AGRO INDUSTRIES LTD. v. SICGIL INDIA LTD. AND 539 OTHERS [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J.] What is the scope and ambit of Section 111A of the 1956 Act, A as amended by Section 59 of the 2013 Act, to rectify the register of members? Which is the appropriate forum for adjudication and determination of violations and consequent actions under the SEBI (SAST) Regulations 1997 and the SEBI (PIT) Regulations 1992? Re: Interpretation and scope of Section 111A of the 1956 B Act as replaced by Section 59 of the 2013 Act: 16. The reliefs claimed by the Appellant in its Company Petition under Section 111A of the 1956 Act is as under: - “(a) Declaration that the acquisition of shares of and in the C company by the Respondent Nos.1 to 6 are illegal, null and void and of no effect; (b) Necessary directions be given for rectifying the records by deleting the names of the Respondents as owners of all shares of and in the company acquired by the Respondents; D (c) Permanent injunction restraining the Respondents whether by themselves or their servants or agents or assigns or otherwise howsoever from exercising any rights or receiving any benefit in respect of the shares held by the Respondents in the company in any manner whatsoever; E (d) ……. (e) …….” 17. The declaration to hold the acquisition of shares by the Respondents as null and void in a petition under Section 111A has to be examined in the context of the scope and ambit of the rectificatory F jurisdiction of the Tribunal and, in particular, the specific wordings of the said provision. 18. The rectificatory powers of a Board/Company Court under Section 38 of the Companies Act, 1913, then under Section 155 of the 1956 Act, followed by Section 111A introduced by the 1996 Amendment G to the 1956 Act, and finally, Section 59 of the 2013 Act, demonstrate that its essential ingredients have remained the same. It is a summary power to carry out corrections or rectifications in the register of members. The rectification must relate to and be confined to the facts that are evident and need no serious enquiry. The following is a comparative table H 540 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A indicating the legislative changes. For the purpose of the present proceeding, we can confine the examination between the 1956 Act with its 1996 amendment and the 2013 Act.
