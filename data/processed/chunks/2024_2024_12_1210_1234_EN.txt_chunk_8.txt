While so, the decision of this Court in Bhoop Singh (supra) was also elaborately discussed. The relevant portions of the said are reproduced below for ready reference: “6. Under Section 17(1)(b), non-testamentary instruments which purport or operate to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future, any right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent, of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, to or in immovable property requires registration. The word “instrument” is not defined in the Registration Act, but is defined in the Stamp Act, 1899 by Section 2(14). 7. A compromise decree passed by a court would ordinarily be covered by Section 17(1)(b) but sub-section (2) of Section 17 provides for an exception for any decree or of a court except a decree or expressed to be made on a compromise and comprising immovable property other than that which is the subject-matter of the suit or proceeding. Thus, by virtue of sub-section (2) (vi) of Section 17 any decree or of a court does not require registration. In sub-clause (vi) of sub-section (2), one category is excepted from sub-clause (vi) i.e. a decree or expressed to be made on a compromise and comprising immovable property other than that which is the subject-matter of the suit or proceeding. Thus, by conjointly reading Section 17(1)(b) and Section 17(2) (vi), it is clear that a compromise decree comprising 8 Arising out of SLP (C) No.32799 of 2019) 9 Mohammade Yusuf & others v. Rajkumar & others (2020) 10 SCC 264 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1223 Mukesh v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. immovable property other than which is the subject- matter of the suit or proceeding requires registration, although any decree or of a court is exempted from registration by virtue of Section 17(2)(vi). A copy of the decree passed in Suit No. 250-A of 1984 has been brought on record as Annexure P-2, which indicates that decree dated 4-10-1985 was passed by the Court for the property, which was subject-matter of the suit. Thus, the exclusionary clause in Section 17(2)(vi) is not applicable and the compromise decree dated 4-10-1985 was not required to be registered on plain reading of Section 17(2) (vi). The High Court referred to of this Court in Bhoop Singh Vs. Ram Singh Major and Others, (1995) 5 SCC 709, in which case, the provision of Section 17(2) (vi) of Registration Act came for consideration. This Court in the above case while considering clause (vi) laid down following in paragraphs 16, 17 and 18:- “16. We have to view the reach of clause (vi), which is an exception to sub-section (1), bearing all the aforesaid in mind. We would think that the exception engrafted is meant to cover that decree or of a court, including a decree or expressed to be made on a compromise, which declares the pre-existing right and does not by itself create new right, title or interest in praesenti in immovable property of the value of Rs 100 or upwards.
