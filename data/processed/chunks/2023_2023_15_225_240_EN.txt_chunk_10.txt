As observed above, the State is a secured creditor under the GVAT Act. Section 3(30) of the IBC defi nes secured creditor to mean a creditor in favour of whom security interest is credited. Such security interest could be created by operation of law. The defi nition of secured creditor in the IBC does not exclude any Government or Governmental Authority.” 240 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 27. In view of the above stated position, we are of the opinion that the well-considered sought to be reviewed does not fall within the scope and ambit of Review. The learned Counsels for the Review Petitioners have failed to make out any mistake or error apparent on the face of record in the impugned , and have failed to bring the case within the parameters laid down by this Court in various decision for reviewing the impugned . Since we are not inclined to entertain these Review Petitions, we do not propose to deal with the other submissions made by the learned Counsels for the parties on merits. 28. In that view of the matter, all the Review Petitions are dismissed. Headnotes prepared by: Review Petitions dismissed. Ankit Gyan
