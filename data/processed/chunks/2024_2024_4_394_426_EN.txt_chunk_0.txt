The issue arising for consideration is as to the validity of the High Court’s findings that grounds u/ss. 100(1)(b), 100(1)(d)(i) and 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 were established, warranting invalidation of the election of KK. Headnotes Representation of the People Act, 1951 – ss. 100(1)(b), 100(1) (d)(i), 123 – Election – Filing of nomination – Submission of material particulars – Non-disclosure of three vehicles – High Court held non-disclosure of vehicles as corrupt practice – Correctness: Held: The High Court was of opinion that appellant’s failure to disclose the three vehicles (two scooty and van), that stood registered in the names of his dependent family members, amounted to a corrupt practice – The High Court assumed that the non- disclosure of a vehicle registered in the name of a candidate or his dependent family members was sufficient in itself to constitute undue influence – One scooty was in name of wife of the appellant, DW5 deposed that he had taken this vehicle as scrap and sold it to DW6 – DW6 confirmed the same – In relation to other two vehicles in question, there were actual documents of conveyance and also proof of the requisite forms prescribed under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 being duly filled in by wife and son of appellant – Form No. 29, relating to notice of ownership transfer of a vehicle by the registered owner, viz., the transferor, was issued in respect of each of these vehicles but despite the same, the transferees did not do the needful to get their own names registered as the owners – Once it is accepted that the three vehicles in question * Author [2024] 4 S.C.R. 395 Karikho Kri v. Nuney Tayang and Another were either gifted or sold before the filing of the nomination by KK, the said vehicles cannot be considered to be still owned by KK’s wife and son for purposes other than those covered by the Act of 1988 – However, the High Court did not take note of this distinguishing factor in the case on hand – The vehicles were not owned and possessed in praesenti by the dependent family members of KK at the time of the filing of his nomination – Non- disclosure of three vehicles cannot be held against KK – Such non-disclosure cannot be treated as an attempt on his part to unduly influence the voters, thereby inviting the wrath of Section 123(2) of the Act of 1951. [Paras 20,21,22,25,27,28] Representation of the People Act, 1951 – Election – Filing of nomination – Non-disclosure of three vehicles – Vehicles sold/ gifted – The High Court was of the opinion that, notwithstanding vehicles were sold/gifted, these vehicles continued to stand in the names of the dependent wife and son of KK – In consequence, upon considering the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the decision of the Supreme Court in Naveen Kumar v. Vijay Kumar and others [2018] 2 SCR 572, it was held that vehicles were owned by the dependent wife and son of KK but they were not disclosed in the Affidavit in Form No.
