The State cannot under the guise of helping these affected persons extract work of utility and value from them without paying them the minimum wage.” Justice Pathak wrote a concurring opinion, holding the Exemption Act to be violative of Article 14. The Court directed the State government to pay the arrears of the difference between the minimum wage and the actual wage paid to the construction workers. 76. It was pointed out to this Court in Labourers Working on Salal Hydro Project v. State of Jammu & Kashmir115 that a large number of migrant workmen from different States working on a hydro-electric project were denied the benefit of labour laws and were exploited by 114 [1983] 2 SCR 271 : (1983) 1 SCC 525 115 [1983] 2 SCR 473 : (1983) 2 SCC 181 554 [2024] 10 S.C.R.

In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India,116 the petitioner had highlighted the issue of bonded labourers in stone quarries of Faridabad district and and their inhuman living conditions. Referring to the provisions of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976, the discussed the meaning of “bonded labour”. According to the Act, a bonded labourer is someone who has incurred or is presumed to have incurred a bonded debt.117 A bonded debt refers to an advance received or presumed to have been received by a bonded labourer under or in pursuance of the bonded labour system.118 The inference of this definition, according to the State government, was that bonded labourers must first prove that they are providing forced labour in consideration of an advance or other economic consideration received by them. The Court rejected this reasoning, stating that it would be “cruel to insist” that a bonded labourer “should have to go through a formal process of trial with the normal procedure for recording of evidence.” It was further observed that “a bonded labourer can never stand up to the rigidity and formalism of the legal process due to his poverty, illiteracy and social and economic backwardness and if such a procedure were required to be followed, the State Government might as well obliterate this Act from the statute book”. The Court also noted that statistically, “most of bonded labourers are members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes or other backward classes”. 78. The held that whenever a labourer is made to provide forced labour, the presumption would be that it is consideration of an advance or other economic consideration received by him, and he is thus a bonded labourer. This presumption may, however, be rebutted by the employer or the State Government by providing satisfactory material. The Court reiterated the constitutional obligation of the 116 [1984] 2 SCR 67 : (1984) 3 SCC 161 117 Section 2(f), Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 118 Section 2(d), Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
