PC to quash the FIR registered against the appellant therein under different Sections of IPC including Section 306, IPC. For the purpose of this case, it is only referred to paragraph 12 therein, insofar as it is relevant which reads thus:- “In to bring out an offence under Section 306 IPC specific abetment as contemplated by Section 107 IPC on the part of the accused with an intention to bring about the suicide of the person concerned as a result of that abetment is required. The intention of the accused to aid 1 [2011] 3 SCR 437 : (2011) 3 SCC 626 2 [2010] 10 SCR 351 : (2010) 8 SCC 628 3 [2009] 13 S.C.R. 230 : (2009) 16 SCC 605 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 1059 M. Vijayakumar v. State of Tamil Nadu or to instigate or to abet the deceased to commit suicide is a must for this particular offence under Section 306 IPC………” 8. Thus, an analysis of the provisions under Section 306, IPC with reference to abetment as contemplated under Section 107, IPC and the decisions in M. Mohan’s case (supra) and Madan Mohan Singh’s case (supra) would reveal that while considering the question as to whether a person can be convicted under Section 306, IPC or whether a conviction thereunder could be sustained, one has to consider the mens rea of the accused/convict to bring about suicide of the victim. Needless to say, that it requires an active act or direct act which led the victim to commit suicide seeing no option; and in other words, the act must have been of such a degree intending to push the deceased into such a position that he/she committed suicide. Bearing in mind the aforesaid position, we will analyse the case of the prosecution and the evidence on record to find out whether the prosecution had succeeded in bringing conviction to the appellant under Section 306, IPC. 9. A brief reference to the prosecution case is required in the above regard. As per the prosecution, the victim Senthil Kumar, while working as a supplier in Salem Hotel belonging to one Muthu (A-3), borrowed an amount of Rs. 2000/- from the appellant who is the son of A-3. It is the case that the latter arranged it as a loan on the request of the deceased, from one Kishore, Venkatachalpati Finance. The deceased failed to repay the borrowed amount and then the finance company pestered the appellant for repayment. Enraged by this, the appellant along with one Ravichandran (A- 2) kidnapped the deceased and brought him to the shop of A-2 and from there took him and wrongfully confined him in the tailor shop of one Sampath Kumar (PW-3), on 06.12.2002 demanding repayment of the borrowed amount. For wrongfully confining him and thereby instigating him to commit suicide, accused Nos. 3 to 5 had played their role along with the appellant and A2. It is unable to withstand the torment that Senthil Kumar committed suicide by hanging in the tailoring shop of PW-3.
