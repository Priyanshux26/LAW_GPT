Prolonged separation of over fifteen years, coupled with lack of any effort to resolve disputes or reconcile, supported the conclusion that the marital bond had become a legal fiction. 13. The High Court noted that the respondent’s efforts for reunion were unsuccessful, as the appellant displayed indifference towards reconciliation. Her insistence on retrieving her belongings from the matrimonial home and the absence of any subsequent action for [2024] 12 S.C.R. 761 Amutha v. A.R. Subramanian restitution of conjugal rights further illustrated her lack of interest in continuing the marriage. Her admission during cross-examination that she had not taken any steps for reconciliation further strengthened the conclusion that she was not genuinely invested in salvaging the marriage. The Court emphasized that the factum of separation and animus deserendi, that is, the intention to desert, were conclusively established, and in the absence of reasonable justification for her conduct, the appellant’s actions amounted to both cruelty and desertion. 14. The High Court underscored that mental cruelty cannot be established through direct evidence but must be inferred from the cumulative circumstances of the case. It observed that the appellant’s behavior, including the filing of a false dowry harassment complaint and her prolonged separation from the respondent, clearly fell within the parameters of mental cruelty as outlined in Samar Ghosh (Supra). This included sustained reprehensible conduct, studied neglect, and indifference that rendered cohabitation intolerable and caused significant mental anguish to the respondent. 15. Further, the High Court addressed the breakdown of the marriage, noting that the prolonged separation of over fifteen years demonstrated that the marital relationship was beyond repair. Relying on precedents such as Naveen Kohli (Supra), it held that maintaining the facade of marriage under such circumstances serves no purpose and only perpetuates emotional distress for both parties. The High Court emphasized that refusing to dissolve a marriage that has become defunct de facto, despite its legal tie, undermines the sanctity of marriage and disregards the emotional well-being of the parties. 16. Hence, the High Court found that the respondent had sufficiently established the grounds of cruelty and desertion under Section 13(1)(ia) and (ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 19553. It held that the appellant’s false criminal complaint and her indifference to reconciliation efforts caused significant mental agony to the respondent, amounting to cruelty. Additionally, her prolonged separation without reasonable cause constituted desertion. The High Court dissolved the marriage and set aside the decisions of the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court, granting a decree of divorce to the husband. It noted that 3 In short, ‘HMA’ 762 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports maintaining the marital tie under these circumstances was contrary to public interest and the principles of justice, and therefore, the appeal was allowed. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 17. The appellant contends that the High Court erred in reversing the concurrent findings of fact established by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court. According to the appellant, the High Court overstepped its jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 19084, which allows intervention only in cases involving a substantial question of law.
