Value of Mitigation Putting a conservative value of US$ 5 per tonne of CO 2 locked in our forests, this huge sink of about 24,000 mt of CO is worth US$ 120b, or Rs 6,00,000 crores. 2 Incremental carbon under scenario three will add a value of around US$ 1.2b, or Rs 6,000 crores every year to India’s treasury of forest sink, assuming a value of US$ 7 per tonne.” (emphasis supplied) A recent report of the Reserve Bank of India presents a very disturbing scenario. The report clearly suggests the enormous potential impact of climate change on the society, leading to serious job losses in every sector. Therefore, the adverse effect will be on the future of the nation as a whole, as against an identifiable group. “Report on Currency and Finance; Towards a Greener Cleaner India”, published by the Reserve Bank of India, (2022-2023), (pp. 45, 47), “4. Macroeconomic Impact of Climate Change in India xxx xxx xxx II.32 India, along with countries such as Brazil and Mexico, face high risk of reduction in economic growth, if global warming raises temperature by 2 degree Celsius as against 1.5 degree Celsius (IPCC, 2018). Climate change manifested through rising temperature and changing patterns of monsoon rainfall in India could cost the economy 2.8 per cent of its GDP and depress the living standards of nearly half of its population by 2050 (Mani et al., 2018). India could lose anywhere around 3 per cent to 10 per cent of its GDP annually by 2100 due to climate change (Kompas et al., 2018; Picciariello et al., 2021) in the absence of adequate mitigation policies. Furthermore, Indian agriculture (along with construction activity) as well as industry are particularly vulnerable to labour productivity losses caused by heat related stress (Somnathan et al., 2021). India could account for 34 million of the projected 80 million global job losses from heat stress associated productivity decline by 2030 (World Bank, 2022). Further, up to 4.5 per cent of India’s 124 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports GDP could be at risk by 2030 owing to lost labour hours from extreme heat and humidity conditions. Moreover, heatwaves could also last 25 times longer, i.e., rise in severity, by 2036-2065 if current rate of carbon emissions is not contained (CMCC, 2021). These estimates, thus, underscore the importance of timely adoption and faster implementation of climate mitigation policies to reduce the adverse impact on the Indian economy.” (emphasis supplied) One way of dealing with this situation is preserving the existing forests, while making an endeavour to enhance its cover. An understanding from the economic and social perspective would be the best approach. 36. The concept of “Green Accounting” in evaluating a nation’s wealth, including its natural assets, would extend enormous benefits which are both tangible and intangible. There are numerous resources that are being tapped from the forests. Therefore, what is required is a comprehensive approach.
