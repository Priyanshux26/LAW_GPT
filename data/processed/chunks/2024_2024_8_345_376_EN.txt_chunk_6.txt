Ghori, Police Sub-Inspector (PW-17), who testified on oath that the statement of first informant, Mohammad Arif 1 [2015] 1 SCR 721 : (2015) 7 SCC 178 354 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Memon (PW-11) was reduced into writing by him at Krishna Medical Hospital, Karamsad at 11:00 pm. 10.4 That the evidence of Demistalkumar (PW-12) also creates grave doubt about the very presence of the first informant, Mohammad Arif Memon (PW-11) at the place of incident, as the witness clearly stated in his evidence that he saw only the injured lying at the crime scene in a profusely bleeding condition. 10.5 That Demistalkumar (PW-12) made gross improvements in his evidence while identifying the three appellants in the dock for the first time after a span of more than two and a half years. The witness admitted in his cross-examination that he had not provided any details in his statement, recorded under Section 161 CrPC, about the identity of assailants. The identification in the dock without any Test Identification Parade (TIP) is a weak and unreliable piece of evidence. In support of this submission, learned counsel placed reliance on the rendered by this Court in the case of Amrik Singh v. State of Punjab. 2 10.6 That K.N. Waghela, Head Constable (PW-16), posted at the Anand Town Police Station admitted in his cross-examination that a telephonic wardhi about the incident was noted down by him. However, the witness was not in a position to recollect the exact time of recording of the telephonic wardhi. The witness stated that it was mentioned in the telephonic wardhi, that an indiscriminate assault with sword and other sharp weapons had been made upon Mohammad Sohail (deceased). It was admitted by the witness in his cross-examination, that no reference of a sword was made in the FIR. It was also admitted that there was no reference of dagger and gupti in the telephonic wardhi. It was contended that the daily dairy entry pertaining to the recording of the telephonic wardhi was also not produced on record by the prosecution which tantamounts to concealment of vital facts requiring adverse inference to be drawn against the prosecution. 2 [2022] 7 SCR 451 : (2022) 9 SCC 402 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 355 Allarakha Habib Memon Etc. v. State of Gujarat 10.7 That the information about the commission of crime had been received at the police station at 9:15 pm, is clear from the evidence of Demistalkumar (PW-12) and therefore, the statement of the first informant (PW-11) recorded by S.N. Ghori, PSI (PW-17) at a later point of time, would tantamount to a statement under Section 161 CrPC and resultantly, it will be hit by Section 162 CrPC. In support of this contention, learned counsel placed reliance on a rendered by this Court in the case of Animireddy Venkata Ramana & Ors. v. Public Prosecutor, High Court of Andhra Pradesh.3 10.8 Mustaq (PW-13), another projected eyewitness to the incident, deposed that he was also present at the place of occurrence and had seen the accused appellants assaulting the deceased.
