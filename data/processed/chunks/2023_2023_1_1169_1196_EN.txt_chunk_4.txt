However, the manner of C its implementation, the timing of applicability of a scheme, and its impact, especially where it results in exclusion of a certain section of public employees from the benefit, are subject matters of scrutiny by the court, especially, when the complaint is of discrimination and violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. This is one such case. 3. The appellant association (consisting of employees who had D superannuated, opted for VRS, resigned, or legal heirs of expired employees of the respondent corporation) challenge a 1 of the Bombay High Court (Nagpur bench). In that proceeding, the appellants had complained of discrimination against the decision dated 29.03.2010, of the Industry, Energy and Labour Department, Government of E Maharashtra (hereafter “the State”). That decision denied the benefit of revision of pay scales, as recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission, to the employees of the Maharashtra State Financial Corporation (hereafter “MSFC”) who had retired or died during the period of 01.01.2006 to 29.03.2010. That decision of the State made the revision of pay scale as a result of the Report of the Fifth Pay Commission F applicable to 115 employees of MSFC who were working as on 29.03.2010. The revision, however, was given effect from 01.01.2006. 4. The appellants had urged before the High Court, that denying them the benefit of pay scales was discriminatory and arbitrary, because they were in continuous service, and had even received the benefit of G interim revision, pending finalization of pay scales pursuant to the Pay Commission Report. It was urged that those in employment on and after 29.03.2010, and those who continued in service after 01.01.2006 but retired before 29.03.2010, belonged to the same category. The only 1 dated 19.06.2018 in W.P. No. 1420/2013 H 1176 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A difference between those who were in service after the latter date, was that they had longer period of service. However, the crucial date for grant of pay revision, was the date from which it was given effect to, i.e., 01.01.2006. As all the appellants were in service as on that date, the denial of pay revision, which was concededly for the period they had worked, amounted to not only hostile discrimination, but also withholding B of pay revision benefits, legitimately and rightfully theirs. 5. By the impugned , the High Court accepted the submissions of MSFC and the State, that financial considerations were of importance in regard to grant or denial of monetary benefits. The MSFC had also urged before the High Court, that the benefit was granted to those C employees on the rolls of the corporation, as of 29.03.2010, in to motivate and incentivise them for better performance. 6. After quoting the counter affidavit filed by the State Government, which approved such revision, the High Court accepted MSFC’s argument: D ““…It was also considered that there were only 115 employees working in the Respondent No.2 Corporation and the said strength of said employees will further reduce in near future.
