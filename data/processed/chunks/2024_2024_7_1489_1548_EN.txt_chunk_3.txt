[Paras 84, 90] Constitution of India – Art. 19(1)(g) – The right to practice law – Fees or licences levied by the authorities – Unreasonableness: Held: According to the current enrolment fee structure of the SBCs, an advocate has to pay anywhere between Rupees fifteen thousand to Rupees forty-two thousand as a pre-condition to enrolment – The SBCs charge enrolment fees in excess of the stipulated fee prescribed under Section 24(1)(f) – The excess enrolment fee imposed by the SBCs is without authority of law – Compounded with this there are no reasonable criteria behind the decision of the SBCs to charge such exorbitant amounts as enrolment fees – The SBCs cannot have unbridled powers to charge any fees given the express legislative policy under Section 24(1)(f) – Imposing excessive financial burdens on young law graduates at the time of enrolment causes economic hardships, especially for those belonging to the marginalized and economically weaker sections of the society – Therefore, the current enrolment fee structure charged by the SBCs is unreasonable and infringes Article 19(1)(g). [Para 102] Advocates Act, 1961 – Exorbitant Enrolment fees charged by the SBCs – Financial implications for the SBCs and the BCI: Held: According to the legislative scheme of the Advocates Act, the Bar Councils must only charge the amount stipulated under Section 24(1)(f) as an enrolment fee – Once the advocates are enrolled on 1494 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the State rolls, the Bar Councils can charge fees for the services provided to the advocates in accordance with the provisions of the Advocates Act – It is for the SBCs and the BCI to devise an appropriate method of charging fees that is fair and just not only for the law graduates intending to enroll, but also for the advocates already enrolled on the State rolls – There are several reasonable ways by which the SBCs and BCI can and already do collect funds at later stages of an advocate’s career.
