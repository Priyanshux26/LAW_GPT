Dev. rev., 283 (1983). 28 Id. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1157 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 34. The Indian Independence Act, 1947 was passed on 18.07.1947, dividing erstwhile India into two new nations, i.e., India and Pakistan. Considering the incessant migration at the time of partition, the Influx from West Pakistan (Control) Ordinance, 1948 was promulgated, putting into place a permit system. The ordinance was subsequently replaced by the Influx from Pakistan (Control) Ordinance, 1948. Thereafter, on 22.04.1949, the Influx from Pakistan (Control) Act, 1949 was enacted. 35. It was the understanding during the drafting of the Constitution that as Assam and East Bengal shared a long history of migration, thus it would not be prudent to apply the permit system for migration in East India vis-à-vis the permit system that was in place for the territory of North-West India and erstwhile West Pakistan. Consequently, the permit system was never implemented in relation to the b with East Pakistan. 36. At the time of independence, Assam occupied one-fifteenth of India’s total land surface and had a very fluid b. The muddy and riverine b with East Pakistan led to regular trouble as disputes over territory surfaced. There were claims and counter-claims about the territorial jurisdiction of India and East Pakistan.29 37. In 1950, keeping in mind the excessive migration taking place into Assam post-independence, the Government of India sought to stabilize the situation and protect the resources of the country from excess migration and enacted IEAA, 1950. During this period, there were instances of communal disturbance and some immigrants living in the districts of Goalpara, Kamrup and Darrang in Assam fled to East Pakistan, leaving their properties behind.30 38. Inter-alia in light of the aforesaid developments, an agreement between the Governments of India and Pakistan respectively was signed on 08.04.1950, popularly known as the Nehru-Liaquat Agreement,31 whereby refugees were allowed to return to dispose of their properties. 29 ArupJyoti sAiKiA, Quest For moDern AssAm: A history (Penguin Books 2023). 30 Id. 31 Agreement Between the Government of India and Pakistan Regarding Security and Rights of Minorities (Nehru-Liaquat Agreement), India-Pak., Apr. 8, 1950, New Delhi. 1158 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 39. On 26.12.1952, the Influx from Pakistan (Control) Repealing Act, 1952 was enacted to repeal the Influx from Pakistan (Control) Act, 1949 and this ended the permit system w.e.f. 15.10.1952. 40. The Citizenship Act, 1955 came into force on 30.12.1955, inter-alia, prescribing and laying down the various manners and conditions under which the citizenship of India was to be obtained or granted. 41. Post the partition of the country, there were constant skirmishes between the two newly born nations, and the India-Pakistan war of 1965 occasioned a large-scale migration of people from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) into India, particularly into the states of Assam and West Bengal, creating fresh security concerns. 42. Until 1963, the task of detection, prosecution and deportation of illegal immigrants was solely done by the police forces. Concerned by the excessive migration to Assam as well as the lack of judicial scrutiny in the procedure of detection and deportation of immigrants, the Government decided to establish tribunals in Assam to bring in an element of judicial scrutiny and as such the Foreigners (Tribunals) , 1964 was issued.
