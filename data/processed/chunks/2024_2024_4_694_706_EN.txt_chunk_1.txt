XXIII, r. 3 – Recording of the compromise and the consequent decree, although appearing procedurally delayed, adhered to the process required under CPC – Furthermore, the High Court overlooked the fact that legal heir of defendant No 2, had previously objected to the execution proceedings, which was dismissed – Subsequent appeals before the High Court, including a Special Leave Petition were also dismissed – Thus, similar objections by respondent No. 1, in her capacity as one of the legal heirs of defendant No. 2 would not be maintainable and would amount to abuse of process of law – Executing Court rightly rejected the objections u/s. 47 filed by the respondent no. 1 – Impugned of the High Court is set aside and that of the executing court is restored – Ord.
