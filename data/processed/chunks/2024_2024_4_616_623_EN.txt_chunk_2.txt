But this is not enough. Even this application, filed in the year 2017, was admittedly not pressed before the Trial Court by the appellant, for [2024] 4 S.C.R. 619 K.B. Lal (Krishna Bahadur Lal) v. Gyanendra Pratap & Ors. the reason that correct facts were not mentioned in the application. Finally, another application under IX, Rule 7 of the CPC came to be filed yet again by the appellant on 23.11.2020. 6. This second application filed by the appellant was dismissed by the trial court vide dated 07.10.2021. What weighed in with the trial court, while dismissing the appellant’s application under IX, Rule 7 of the CPC, was the fact that the appellant was duly served and had filed vakalatnama of his counsel in April 2006 but did not file written statements in time and on 12.07.2011 an application was filed by the appellant, seeking permission to file the written statements. It was noted by the Trial Court that the explanation tendered by the appellant for the delay in filing the application under IX, Rule 7 of the CPC was that the advocate appointed by him at the time of receiving summons, i.e., April 2006, did not pursue the matter diligently and had defrauded the appellant. Thus, the appellant appointed another advocate, namely Shri R.D. Rastogi in May 2006. This explanation, as noted by the trial court, was based on contradictory statements and wrong facts, and no reasonable cause was given for the delay caused. Hence, it was dismissed. 7. Aggrieved by dated 07.10.2021 by which his application under IX, Rule 7 of the CPC for setting aside the dated 06.09.2006 was dismissed by the trial court, the appellant preferred a Revision, which came before Additional District Judge, Barabanki (hereinafter referred to as “Revisional Court”). Vide dated 28.03.2022, the revisional court dismissed the Civil Revision filed by the appellant. The revisional court, upon examination of the material on record, found that the first application under IX, Rule 7 of the CPC which was filed by the appellant on 01.09.2017, was not pressed, owing to the fact that initially he had appointed an advocate who did not attend the case, and wrong facts were mentioned by a ‘junior advocate’ in the first application. Hence, another advocate filed the second application on 23.11.2020, mentioning the correct facts. Yet, the signature on the first application filed in the year 2017 and on that of the second application filed in the year 2020 were of the same advocate, namely, Shri R.D. Rastogi. It was also observed by the revisional court that although it was averred by the appellant that he was put in dark by the counsel earlier engaged by him, there is no reference to his name. Thus, upon consideration of the entire material on the record, it was held by the revisional court 620 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports that the application under IX, Rule 7 of the CPC for recalling dated 06.09.2006 was filed by the appellant not only after a long delay of 14 years, but also without assigning any satisfactory reasons for the delay, hence, the revisional court found no error in the dated 07.10.2021 of the trial court and accordingly, the Civil Revision preferred by the appellant was dismissed.
