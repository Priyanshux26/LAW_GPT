3, requires that each House ‹keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their require Secrecy . . ..› This Clause has not been the subject of extensive judicial examination. See Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 670–671, 12 S.Ct. 495, 496–497, 36 L.Ed. 294 (1892); United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 4, 12 S.Ct. 507, 508, 36 L.Ed. 321 (1892).] We cannot but conclude that the Senator’s arrangements with 560 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Beacon Press were not part and parcel of the legislative process.” (emphasis supplied) 151. The Court in Gavel (supra) applied the same standard it did in Brewster (supra) to hold that only acts which are essential to the deliberations of the House or in discharge of the functions vested under the Constitution are immune from prosecution before a court of law. Other acts which may in some way be related to the speech or vote of a legislator will not be protected under the Speech and Debate Clause unless they were essential to the legislator’s function. The Court therefore held a consistent position that members of Congress would only have immunity under the Constitution for their ‘sphere of legitimate legislative activity.’ 152. In United States v. Helstoski,74 a member of the House of Representatives was accused of accepting money in return for introducing certain private bills to suspend the application of immigration laws. Relying on its previous rulings in Johnson (supra), Brewster (supra) and Gavel (supra) the US Supreme Court held that the purpose of the Speech and Debate Clause was to free the legislator from executive and judicial oversight that realistically threatens to control his conduct as a legislator. The Court reaffirmed the position of American law that material from the legislative acts of the accused Congressman may not be relied on or placed before the grand jury but proof of bribe and promise to commit a future legislative act may be investigated as they do not constitute an essential function of the legislator in discharge of his duties. 153. We may helpfully refer to another decision before concluding the analysis of the position of law in the United States. In Hutchinson v. Proxmire,75 a Senator would release a publication highlighting what he perceived to be “wasteful government spending”. The Senator made a speech on the floor of the Senate and had it published in the press. The complainant, who was funded by public institutes for his research, was named by the Senator. The press release was circulated to over one hundred thousand people including agencies 74 442 US 477 (1979) 75 439 US 1066 (1979) [2024] 3 S.C.R. 561 Sita Soren v. Union of India which funded the research of the complainant. The complainant filed a suit claiming loss of respect in his profession, loss of income and the ability to earn income in the future. The District Court granted summary in favour of the Senator, holding that the publication fell under the ‘information function’ of Congress and would be immune under the Speech and Debate Clause.
