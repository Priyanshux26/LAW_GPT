The appellant, Commercial Tax Officer (hereafter called “the revenue”) is aggrieved by the and of the Telangana High Court1, by E which a writ petition filed by the respondent (hereafter “the assessee”) was allowed. 2. The assessee questioned the revenue, complaining that it did not provide copies of assessment for the years 2005-06, 2008-09, 2009-10, and 2010-11 under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 (hereafter “APGST Act”). and Telangana State Value Added Tax F Act, 2005 (hereafter “VAT Act”) and for not lifting attachment dated 03.02.2012 and another, revised attachment dated 20.02.2018 under Form V invoking the provisions of Revenue Recovery Act, 1864 (hereafter “the RR Act”), under Section 27 of the VAT Act. The revenue had issued assessment s for the assessment years (AYs) 2005-06 G to 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11, under which ` 1,88,81,000/-, ` 2,38,84,000/- and ` 2,21,83,854/- was claimed respectively, as tax due and payable. 1 Dated 28.09.2021 in WP No. 3703/2020 H 928 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A 3. The assessee argued, before the High Court that the revenue, despite several requests, did not furnish assessment s, and that it was not aware of them. Since these s were allegedly not served, the assessee submitted that it was unable to examine their correctness and whether they conformed with the provisions of the VAT Act, and further to enable it to avail remedies under the statute. The assessee B alleged that the notice dated 03.02.2012 in Form V under the RR Act invoking Section 27 of the VAT Act for non-payment of arrears of tax to the tune of ` 5,59,58,758/- and attaching its various properties, led it to bring to the notice of the authorities that the arrears so reflected in Form V were erroneous. The assessee requested to cancel the said demand, C since the assessment s for the year 2001-02 and 2003-04 were revised on 24.04.2005 resulting in excess tax collection; it requested that such excess tax collected be adjusted for the subsequent demand. According to the assessee, the revenue thereafter did not issue any further notice and after lapse of about six years, issued a revised notice in Form V dated 20.02.2018 showing arrears of tax in a sum of D ` 5,59,78,758/- for the tax periods 2005-06 to 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 and attached land and building (belonging to the assessee) being Sy. No.182 - H.No.7-3-52/1/2 situated at Gaganpahad village, Rajender Nagar Mandal, Ranga Reddy district measuring 2,224.05 square yards. The assessee relied on various representations2 asking the revenue to E cancel the demand and attachment notices. 4. It was also urged that, though the assessee made several requests for furnishing copies of assessment s and also the date of service of such s passed, the revenue maintained silence, and provided neither. The assessee therefore urged that without effecting F the service of the assessment s, as mandated by law, the revenue could not claim tax shown as arrears, and could not resort to provisions of the RR Act, attaching its properties.
