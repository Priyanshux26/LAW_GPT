Ram Chander Talwar & Nomination made under provisions of S. 45ZA Anr. v. Devender Kumar of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 entitled the Talwar & Ors.15 nominee to receive the deposit amount on the death of the depositor. 26. A consistent view appears to have been taken by the courts, while interpreting the related provisions of nomination under diff erent statutes. It is clear from the referred s that the nomination so made would not lead to the nominee attaining absolute title over the subject property for which such nomination was made. In other words, the usual mode of succession is not to be impacted by such nomination. The legal heirs therefore have not been excluded by virtue of nomination. 27. The presence of the three elements i.e., the term ‘vest’, the provision excluding others as well as a non-obstante clause under S.109A of the Companies Act, 1956 have not persuaded us in the interpretation to be accorded vis-à-vis nomination, in any different manner. Different legislations with provisions pertaining to nomination that have been a subject of adjudication earlier before courts, have little or no similarity with respect to the language used or the provisions contained therein. While the Government Savings 13 (1993) 1 Mah LJ 228 14 (2000) 6 SCC 724 15 (2010) 10 SCC 671 SHAKTI YEZDANI & ANR. v. JAYANAND JAYANT 715 SALGAONKAR & ORS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] Certificates Act, 1959, Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and Public Debts Act, 1944 contain a non-obstante clause, the Insurance Act, 1939 and Cooperative Societies Act, 1912 do not. 28. Similarly, there are variations with respect to the word ‘vest’ being present in some legislations (the Employees Provident Fund Act, 1952) and absent in others (the Insurance Act, 1939, the Cooperative Societies Act, 1912). Looking at the dissimilarities and the fact that uniform defi nition is not available relating to the rights of ‘nominee’ and/or whether such ‘nomination’ bestows absolute ownership over nominees, it is only appropriate that the terms are considered as ordinarily understood by a reasonable person making nominations, with respect to their movable or immovable properties. A reasonable individual arranging for the disposition of his property is expected to undertake any such nomination, bearing in mind the interpretation on the eff ect of nomination, as given by courts consistently, for a number of years. The concept of nomination if interpreted by departing from the well- established manner would, in our view, cause major ramifi cations and create signifi cant impact on disposition of properties left behind by deceased nominators. 29. The legislative intent of creating a scheme of nomination under the Companies Act, 1956 in our opinion is not intended to grant absolute rights of ownership in favour of the nominee merely because the provision contains three elements i.e., the term ‘vest’, a non-obstante clause and the phrase ‘to the exclusion of others’, which are absent in other legislations, that also provide for nomination.
