His explanation that he went home and slept is uninspiring in confidence for the incident took place in his presence and in close proximity of habitation, more specifically at a short distance i.e. just 3-4 minutes of walking distance from the Police Headquarters D where constables are posted around the clock. He left his friend profusely bleeding on the spot but did not seek any help and immediately did not report the incident to the family members of the deceased. [Para 9][752-C-G] 3. This Court on multiple occasions has held that it is not E the quantity but the quality of witnesses and evidence that can either make or break the case of the prosecution. It is the duty of the prosecution to prove that the testimonies of the witnesses that it seeks to rely upon are of sterling quality, i.e. fully trustworthy and absolutely free from any kind of blemish. [Para F 10][752-H; 753-A] 4. In the absence of any other evidence linking the accused to the murder of the deceased, the testimony of PW-3 discarded, there is no other direct or circumstantial evidence, ocular or otherwise, linking the accused be it on the point of motive or the incident. It is in this backdrop it is found that the Courts below to G have seriously erred. The settled principles of convicting the accused on circumstantial evidence, enunciated by this Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra (1984) 4 SCC H 748 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A 116, have not been followed by the Courts below. It is true that concurrent findings of facts of the Courts below, are usually, not to be interfered with. However, it is only in the presence of exceptional circumstances, this Court exercises its wide powers where there is travesty of justice and when absurd and erroneous conclusions are drawn by the Courts below. This is one such case B fit for exercising the powers entrusted to us as a duty under Article 136 of the Constitution. [Paras 16, 17][754-D-G] Jagga Singh v.
