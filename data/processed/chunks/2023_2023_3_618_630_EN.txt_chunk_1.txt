The question which arises for consideration in these appeals, directed against an of the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal1 (hereafter ‘CESTAT’ or ‘tribunal’) is whether the B price at which the appellant M/s Bilag Industries Ltd., Vapi (hereafter ‘BIL’) sold its products to the buyer, should be treated as a transaction with a “related person” under Section 4(4)(c) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (hereafter “the Act”). 2. BIL was incorporated as Mitsu Industries Ltd. (hereafter ‘MIL’) C in 1992; it was formed by members of the Bilkhias family who were its major shareholders/promoters. MIL used to manufacture pesticides, insecticides and their intermediaries classifiable under Chapter 38, Central Tariff Act, 1985 (hereafter ‘CETA’). These fell under the broad category of pyrethroid products. Besides other products like Cypermethrin and alpha Cyermethrin, MIL manufactured Allethrins, Deltamethrin, and D intermediates for the entire range of products. Before July 1999, MIL did not manufacture Esbiothrin and Esbiol (falling under the product group of Allethrins). 3. On 16.02.1998, AgrEvo GmbH and MIL signed a Letter of Intent, and on 22.11.1998 they signed a letter of Memorandum of E Understanding (‘MOU’) expressing their intention to form a joint venture for research, manufacture, and sale of mainly synthetic pyrethroids products and their intermediates. Thereafter, MIL, AgrEvo GmbH, and AgrEvo SA entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) on 03.07.1999. This was for the purpose of researching, developing and manufacturing F agrochemicals and environmental health products. MIL agreed to first transfer its entire non-pyrothroid business to another company, namely, Mitsu Pesticides Ltd. 4. On the date of closing of the JVA, MIL’s name was changed to M/s Bilag Industries Ltd. (‘BIL’). At the time of formation of the joint G venture, AgrEvo SA held 51% of the share capital in BIL and the balance share capital in BIL was held by the Bilakhias family.
