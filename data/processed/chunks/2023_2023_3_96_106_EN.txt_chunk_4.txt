It is submitted that if the ACRs for the years 2016-17 and 2019-20 both having “Good” grading are excluded, in that case for rest of the years, the petitioner was having grading “Very Good” and therefore the petitioner would have got the promotion accordingly. E 3.2 Making above submissions and relying upon the aforesaid decisions, it is prayed to direct the DPC/High Court to ignore the uncommunicated ACR for the year 2016-17 and also the ACR for the year 2019-20, both having “Good” grading and to consider the case of the petitioner for promotion taking into consideration the remaining ACRs, F namely, ACRs for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19 in which the petitioner was having “Very Good” grading. 4.While opposing the present appeal, Shri Maibam Nabaghanashyam Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the High Court has submitted that the petitioner received “Very Good” gradings G only in her ACRs for the year 2017 to 2019 and her ACR gradings were “Good” for the years 2015 and 2016. 4.1 It is submitted that the gradings in the ACRs for the years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 were communicated to the petitioner and others on 08.04.2021, one day before the impugned Departmental H 102 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R.
