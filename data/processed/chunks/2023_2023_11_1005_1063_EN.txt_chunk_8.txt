Moreover, if reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of the accused will not aff ord evidence as to the commission of an off ence, it is quite unlikely that a charge-sheet would even be fi led against the accused for committing an off ence of rape. (Rajendra Prahladrao Wasnik v State of Maharashtra (2019) 12 SCC 495 para 49-57; Prakash Nishad @ Kewat v State of Maharashtra 2023 SCCOnline SC 666 para 57,58.59) 3. Prosecution did not place on record the exculpatory evidence against the Appellant 3.1 The underwear of the Appellant was seized by the police on 01.06.2023 at 11:45 pm [Ex 6 (Seizure memo)], and the underwear of the deceased was seized on 01.06.2015 at 11:00 pm [Ex 6/1 (Seizure memo)]. However, the prosecution failed to prove if they were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for examination. MUNNA PANDEY v. STATE OF BIHAR 1017 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] 3.2 As per the dated 29.06.2015, a letter on behalf of the offi cer in-charge of PS Sabour was fi led before the Ld Trial Court seeking permission to send the articles to FSL Patna for examination. However PW5, Reeta Kumari, the IO in her cross examination before the Trial Court on 24.10.2016 admitted that she followed the instructions of her senior police offi cer and did not receive any FSL report. [PW5 para 8] 3.3 Further the vaginal swab of the deceased collected at the time of post-mortem was sent by PW 4, Dr Sandeep Lal to the pathology lab for examination. [Ex 2 (Post- mortem report)]. However, the pathological report which states that ‘spermatozoa not found’was not produced by the prosecution as evidence at the time of trial. 4. Last seen evidence not conclusively proved against the Appellant 4.1 All the witnesses in their 161 statement stated that the victim was last seen with Pritam Tiwari. However, PW1, PW2 and PW3 in their Court testimony, which was recorded 3 months after Pritam Tiwari was declared a Juvenile by the Juvenile Justice Board [Ex A ( of the JJB)] improved their statement and said that it was Munna Pandey and not Pritam Tiwari. However, this was not corroborated by the independent witness Vijay Sah (PW6). The said improvement on the part of the interested witnesses could be motivated by the fact that Pritam Tiwari (who was caught red handed) was now only going to be subjected to a lenient punishment under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 and therefore the Appellant alone remained accused in the subject case. 4.2 There are material contradictions in PW3’s court testimony and her 161 statement. In her 161 statement she states that Pritam Tiwari came to her house at 09:00 am and took the victim along with him to watch TV and after 2 hours she saw Pritam Tiwari locking the grill of the verandah. Whereas in her Court testimony, she states that Munna Pandey was last seen with the victim. PW3 was confronted with this particular contradiction by the defense counsel during her cross- examination but PW3 does not provide any reason for the said contradiction.
