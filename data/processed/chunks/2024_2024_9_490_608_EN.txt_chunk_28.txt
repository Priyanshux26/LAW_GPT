Hence, in our view, in addition to narrower meaning given to the term “public policy” in Renusagar case, it is required to be held that the award could be set aside if it is patently illegal. The result would be – award could be set aside if it is contrary to: (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (b) the interest of India; or (c) justice or morality, or (d) in addition, if it is patently illegal. Illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature, it cannot be held that award is against the public policy. Award could also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court. Such award is opposed to public policy and is required to be adjudged void. (Emphasis supplied) 38. Following the expansive view of the concept “contrary to public policy”, in D.D.A v. M/s. R.S. Sharma & Co.,29 which related to a 28 [2003] 3 SCR 691 : (2003) 5 SCC 705 29 [2008] 12 SCR 785 : (2008) 13 SCC 80 530 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports matter arising from a proceeding under Section 34, as it stood prior to 2015 amendment, a two-Judge Bench of this Court, on the scope of the power to set aside an arbitral award, summarized the general principles as follows: “21. … (a) An award, which is (i) contrary to substantive provisions of law; or (ii) the provisions of the arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996; or (iii) against the terms of the respective contract; or (iv) patently illegal; or (v) prejudicial to the rights of the parties; Is open to interference by the court under Section 34(2) of the Act. (b) The award could be set aside if it is contrary to: (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (b) the interest of India; or (c) justice or morality.

(d) It is open to the court to consider whether the award is against the specific terms of contract and if so, interfere with it on the ground that it is patently illegal and opposed to public policy of India.” 39. In Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited v. Western Geco International Limited,30 which also related to the period prior to 2015 amendment of Section 34 (2)(b)(ii),31 a three-Judge Bench of this Court, after considering the decision in Saw Pipes (supra), 30 [2014] 12 SCR 1 : (2014) 9 SCC 263 paragraphs 35, 38 and 39 31 See Footnote 18 [2024] 9 S.C.R. 531 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. without exhaustively enumerating the purport of the expression ‘fundamental policy of Indian law’, observed that it would include all such fundamental principles as providing a basis for administration of justice and enforcement of law in this country.
