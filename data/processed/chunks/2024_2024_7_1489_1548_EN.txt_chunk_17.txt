1513 Gaurav Kumar v. Union of India and Ors. guidance of the delegated authority.37 As a corollary, the delegated authority must carry out its rule-making functions within the framework of the law. The delegated legislation must be consistent with the law under which it is made and cannot go beyond the limits of policy and standards laid down in the law.38 28. Although delegated legislation enjoys the presumption of constitutionality, it does not enjoy the same immunity as the parent legislation. It is now well-established39 that delegated legislation can be challenged on the following grounds: (i) lack of legislative competence to make delegated legislation; (ii) violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution; (iii) violation of any provision of the Constitution; (iv) failure to conform to the statute under which it is made or exceeding the limits of authority conferred by the enabling Act; (v) repugnance to any other enactment; and (vi) manifest arbitrariness. 29. Modern legislation often contains provisions enabling the delegate of the legislature to frame subordinate legislation. The statutory provision for delegation is often couched in general terms empowering the delegate the power to frame rules “to carry out the purposes of this Act” or a particular segment of the statute contained in a Chapter. The general provision is then followed by a provision enumerating specific matters on which the delegate may frame rules. A similar legislative scheme is reflected in Sections 15 and 28 of the Advocates Act. Where a rule-making power is conferred upon the delegate in general terms, a subsequent enumeration of matters on which the delegate may frame rules is illustrative and does not limit the scope of the general power.40 The enumerated matters in such a situation 37 Harishankar Bagla v.

Digital Supreme Court Reports provide guidelines for the delegated authority while framing rules in exercise of the general power.41 iv. Power to levy fees 30. Article 265 of the Constitution stipulates that no tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law. Article 366(28) defines taxation or tax to include the imposition of a tax or impost, whether general, local or special. 31. In CIT v. McDowell and Co. Ltd.,42 a three-Judge Bench of this Court enunciated the principles for interpreting Article 265 read with Article 366(28): “21. “Tax”, “duty”, “cess” or “fee” constituting a class denotes various kinds of imposts by State in its sovereign power of taxation to raise revenue for the State.
