2 The bearing No. 30121 of 2018. 3 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the Adjudicating Authority’. H 4 For short, ‘AHAHO’. *Ed. Note : Pagination in the table is as per the original . COMMISSSIONER OF CUSTOMS, CENTRAL EXCISE AND SERVICE TAX, 293 HYDERABAD v. ASHWANI HOMEO PHARMACY [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] Item 3003 90 14 or under any item stated in Chapter 30 of the First A Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 19855-6; and that the product in question, being “Hair oil”, was required to be classified as ‘cosmetic’ under Tariff Item 3305 90 19. Accordingly, the Adjudicating Authority confirmed the demand to the tune of Rs.2,72,14,266/- on the respondent for the differential duty payable in terms of Section 11-A (10) of the B Central Excise Act, 19447; ed payment of interest on the said differential duty in terms of Section 11-AA of the Act of 1944; and imposed penalty in the sum of Rs.54,00,000/- under Rule 25 of the Central Excise Rules, 2002. 1.2. However, the appeal preferred by the respondent was allowed C by the Tribunal by its impugned dated 31.01.2018 and the aforesaid dated 16.10.2015 passed by the Adjudicating Authority was set aside. The Tribunal held that the product in question, AHAHO, fell in the category of ‘medicament’ and hence, was rightly classified under Chapter 30 of the First Schedule to the Act of 1985. D 1.3. An ancillary but intertwined aspect of the matter had been that the product in question was being classified as ‘medicament’ under the said Chapter 30 since the year 1994. According to the respondent, this classification was regularly accepted by the Department in the past with at least two successive s of the Commissioner (Appeals) and hence, there was no justification in re-examining the issue. The E Adjudicating Authority expressed the view that because of material amendment of the tariff entries in Chapters 30 and 33 in the year 2012, classification of the product in question required re-examination. The Tribunal, however, did not approve of this proposition of the Adjudicating Authority. F 1.4. The appellant is aggrieved of the so passed by the Tribunal and hence, has preferred this appeal while asserting that the product in question had rightly been classified by the Adjudicating Authority as ‘cosmetic’ in terms of Chapter 33 and hence, the demand in question deserves to be maintained. On the other hand, the respondent G 5 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the Act of 1985’. 6 In the discussion hereinafter, reference to the relevant Chapter or the relevant Tariff Item is always pertaining to the ‘First Schedule to the Act of 1985’, unless indicated otherwise. 7 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the Act of 1944’. H 294 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A supports the impugned while asserting that the product in question has rightly been classified as ‘medicament’ in terms of Chapter 30. 2. In view of the above, the primary question in this appeal is as to whether the product in question, AHAHO, would be classified as ‘medicament’ under Chapter 30 or as ‘cosmetic’ under Chapter 33 of B the First Schedule to the Act of 1985.
