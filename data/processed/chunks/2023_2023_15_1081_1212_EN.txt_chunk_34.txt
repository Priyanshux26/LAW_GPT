No. 268 68 Richard Garnett, ‘Article 5 of the Model Law: Protector of the Arbitral Process?’ (2021) 38(2) Journal of International Arbitration 127-146. IN RE: INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UNDER 1131 THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT 1996 AND THE INDIAN STAMP ACT 1899 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI ] 74. One of the main objectives of the Arbitration Act is to minimize the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process. Party autonomy and settlement of disputes by an arbitral tribunal are the hallmarks of arbitration law. Section 5 gives eff ect to the true intention of the parties to have their disputes resolved through arbitration in a quick, effi cient, and eff ective manner by minimizing judicial interference in the arbitral proceedings.69 Parliament enacted Section 5 to minimize the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process to the bare minimum, and only to the extent “so provided” under the Part I of Arbitration Act. In doing so, the legislature did not altogether exclude the role of courts or judicial authorities in arbitral proceedings, but limited it to circumstances where the support of judicial authorities is required for the successful implementation and enforcement of the arbitral process.70 The Arbitration Act envisages the role of courts to “support arbitration process”71 by providing necessary aid and assistance when required by law in certain situations. 75. Section 5 begins with the expression “notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force.” The non-obstante clause is Parliament’s addition to the Article 5 of the Model Law. It is of a wide amplitude and sets forth the legislative intent of limiting judicial intervention during the arbitral process. In the context of Section 5, this means that the provisions contained in Part I of the Arbitration Act ought to be given full eff ect and operation irrespective of any other law for the time being in force. It is now an established proposition of law that the legislature uses non-obstante clauses to remove all obstructions which might arise out of the provisions of any other law, which stand in the way of the operation of the legislation which incorporates the non-obstante clause.72 76. A non-obstante clause is appended in a provision to give such provision overriding eff ect over other provisions of the law.73 In 69 Food Corporation of India v. Indian Council of Arbitration, (2003) 6 SCC 564 70 Union of India v. Popular Construction Co., (2001) 8 SCC 470; P Anand Gajapathi Raju v. P.V.G. Raju, (2000) 4 SCC 539 71 Swiss Timing Ltd. v.

Guram,74 Justice Sabyasachi Mukharji explained the purport of non-obstante clause in the following terms: “67. A clause beginning with the expression “notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in some particular provision in the Act or in some particular Act or in any law for the time being in force, or in any contract” is more often than not appended to a section in the beginning with a view to give the enacting part of the section in case of confl ict an overriding eff ect over the provision of the act or the contract mentioned in the non obstante clause.
