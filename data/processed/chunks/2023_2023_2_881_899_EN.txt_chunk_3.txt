v. M/S. UNION CARBIDE 885 CORPORATION & ORS. and substantial relief to victims of the disaster. Thus, it was observed A that a sum of US $ 470 million would be just, equitable, and reasonable. This was to be paid on or before 31.03.1989 and all civil and criminal proceedings were to be closed in the process. 6. A detailed setting out the reasons that persuaded this Court to make the of settlement was passed thereafter on B 04.05.1989, reported as Union Carbide Corporation v. Union of India & Ors.1 We would like to highlight a few aspects of the said . This Court noted that the basic consideration motivating the settlement was the compelling need for urgent relief. It was considered necessary to grant immediate remedy as it was a question of survival for the thousands C of persons rendered destitute by the ghastly disaster.
