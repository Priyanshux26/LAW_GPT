Allowing the writ petition, the Court F HELD: 1.1 In the present case the dispute is with respect to the post of Assistant Registrar in the High Court of Manipur. Prior to the Rules 2020, the promotion to the post of Assistant Registrar was governed by the Gauhati High Court Service Rules, 1967. However, the Manipur High Court framed its own rules namely Rules, 2020. The DPC met to fill up the post of Assistant G Registrar on 09.04.2021. Therefore, as such the Rules, 2020 which were prevailing at the time when the DPC met were rightly considered. It is not in dispute and cannot be disputed that for the post of promotion to the Assistant Registrar the ACRs of preceding four years from the date of DPC were required to be H taken into consideration. Therefore, in the present case the ACRs 96 R. K. JIBANLATA DEVI v. HIGH COURT OF MANIPUR THROUGH 97 ITS REGISTRAR GENERAL for the period between 2016- 2017 to 2019-2020 were required A to be taken into consideration and in fact taken into consideration. As observed hereinabove out of 100 marks ACR weightage was of 80 marks. [Paras 6 and 6.3][103-A-C, F-G] 1.2 In the present case the petitioner got “Good” gradings for the year 2016-17 and received “Very Good” gradings in her B ACRs for the years 2017-18 and 2018-2019. It was the specific case on behalf of the petitioner which has not been denied that the ACRs grading of “Good” for the year 2016-17 was never communicated to the petitioner even till the DPC met. Therefore, uncommunicated ACR for the year 2016-17 having the grading C “Good” could not have been relied upon for consideration for promotion. Similarly, so far as the ACR gradings for the year 2019- 2020 is concerned, admittedly the same was communicated to the petitioner on 08.04.2021, just one day before the DPC met on 09.04.2021.
