FACTUAL MATRIX 22. For a more comprehensive understanding of the issues raised in the present case, it is necessary to refer to the historical and sociological context in which these issues have arisen. a. hiStorical BackgrounD i. Colonial 23. Between 1817 and 1826, there were multiple invasions by the Burmese into Assam. This brought the Kingdom of Ava, i.e., the sovereign kingdom that ruled Upper Burma into conflict with the British East India Company. 24. There was a great deal of mistrust and friction between the British and the Burmese. This culminated into the first Anglo-Burmese war in 1824 which ended with the signing of the Yandabo Peace Treaty on 24.02.1826 between the East India Company and the Burmese Kingdom of Ava. The treaty, inter-alia, stipulated for the ceding of the territories of Assam, Manipur, Arakan, and the Taninthayi to the British. However, two more wars were fought between the British and Burmese before annexation of Burma was completed by the British. 21 Paragraph 364-366 of the of Justice Surya Kant. 22 Id., paragraphs 380-382. 23 Id., paragraph 386.

Adjacent territories, including those forming the present-day states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, were designated as the ‘frontier tracts’ and were annexed in due course. The British province that came to be known as ‘Assam’ roughly took shape by 1873. Subsequently, in the same year, the British introduced inner line under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873 to restrict the migrants.24 26. In 1836, Bengali was declared as the official language of the Bengal province of which Assam was a constituent. In 1839, with the annexation of Maran/Matak territory in upper Assam, the British control over Assam was complete and the British saw it fit to extract the most out of Assam’s fertile lands. 27. The charter granted to the East India Company in 183325 marked the triumph of the British industrial interests over its mercantile interest and had a significant impact on the settlement of the newly conquered Assam. The Charter permitted the Europeans to hold land outside the Presidency towns on a long-term lease or with free-hold rights. This paved the path for a colonial plantation economy.
