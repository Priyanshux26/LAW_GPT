Smt. V.S. Ramadevi, B who had the shortest tenure as the ninth Chief Election Commissioner was drawn from the Civil Services. Her term lasted for sixteen days. The Tenth Chief Election Commissioner was none other than Shri T. N. Sheshan, who was the Eighteenth Cabinet Secretary of India and had a term of six years commencing from 12.12.1990 till 11.12.1996. The 1991 C Act came to be amended, initially, by an Ordinance, and later, by a law made by Parliament, the Ordinance being published on 01.10.1993. Shri M.S. Gill and Shri G.V.G. Krishnamurthy were appointed as Election Commissioners, w.e.f., 01.10.1993. The amendment and the appointments came to be challenged by Shri T. N. Seshan, the Chief Election Commissioner and others and the challenge was repelled by a Constitution D Bench of this Court and the is reported in T.N. Seshan,(supra). We would observe that what was essentially contemplated by founding Fathers was an Election Commission, which was to consist of a permanent figure, viz., the Chief Election Commissioner and such Election Commissioners, as may be necessary. For nearly forty years after the adoption of the Constitution of India, there were only Chief Election E Commissioners. After the in T.N.Seshan (supra), it will be noticed that thereafter, the Election Commission of India became a team consisting of the Chief Election Commissioner and the two Election Commissioners. With the term ofShri T. N. Seshan coming to an end 11.12.1996, the trend began of appointing the Election Commissioners F as Chief Election Commissioners. Thus, Shri M.S. Gill became the Chief Election Commissioner. Shri M.S. Gill was also a Civil Servant. He served as Chief Election Commissioner for a period of four years and sixty- nine days, i.e., from 12.12.1996 till 13.06.2001. Shri G.V.G. Krishnamurthy continued till 30.09.1999 (nearly six years) as Election Commissioner. Shri James Michael Lyngdoh became an Election Commissioner in the G year 1997 and was made the Chief Election Commissioner on 14.06.2001, on the expiry of the term of Shri M.S. Gill, and he continued till 07.02.2004 (the term lasted two years and two hundred and sixty-nine days). Thereafter, we may notice, for the period 2000 to 2022, the details of the Election Commissioners and the Chief Election Commissioners and the H length of the tenure, which is as follows: ANOOP BARANWAL v. UNION OF INDIA 65 [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] A B C D E O. A CLOSER LOOK AT S.S. DANOA (SUPRA), THE 1991 ACT AND T.N. SESHAN (SUPRA) 53. It was on 07.10.1989 that the President, in exercise of his powers under Clause 2 of Article 324 of the Constitution, fixed the number F of Election Commissioners as two. This was to continue until further s. Later on, on 16.10.1989, two persons of which, one was Shri S.S. Dhanoa, were appointed as the Election Commissioners. It was for the first time after Independence that Election Commissioners were appointed, thereby making the Election Commission of India a multi- G Member Commission. In other words, till 16.10.1989, the Chief Election Commissioner constituted the Election Commission of India.
