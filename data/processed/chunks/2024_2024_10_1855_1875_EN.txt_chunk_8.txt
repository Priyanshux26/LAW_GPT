1). 14.2. Zahoor Ahmed, father of the appellants, had filed objection before the Consolidation Officer claiming co-tenancy rights 1866 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in Khata Nos. 98 and 99 to the extent of half share. He also claimed one half share in plot No. 115 of Khata No. 100. 14.3. According to Zahoor Ahmed (father of the appellants), the disputed Khatas were acquired jointly by the common ancestor. After the death of Satai and Allah Bux, the name of Abdul Ghafoor was recorded since he had attained majority by that time and Abdul Shakoor was still a minor. Abdul Ghafoor was ‘karta’ of the family and he looked after Abdul Shakoor and Mohammad Ismail. After the death of Abdul Ghafoor, in view of the settlement arrived at between the legal heirs of Abdul Ghafoor and Zahoor Ahmed, the parties were in cultivatory possession of their respective shares in the disputed Khatas. 14.4. On the other hand, Sami Ullah and Badlu (respondents) had contended that Khata No. 98 was taken on patta by Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad. In the said patta, share of Abdul Ghafoor was mentioned as 5/6 and that of Mohammad 1/6. After the death of Mohammad, his share devolved in equal proportion upon Abdul Ghafoor and Abdul Shakoor. Therefore, the appellants who represents the branch of Abdul Shakoor got only 1/12 share. 14.5. The case of the contesting objectors (the respondents) with regard to plot Nos. 35, 57, 111 and 112 comprising Khata No. 99 was that these plots were their exclusive property in view of the registered relinquishment deed dated 30.06.1948 (which was registered on 07.07.1948 and executed by the father of the appellant Zahoor Ahmed) in favour of the respondents. They contended that the said Khata was neither recorded in the name of Zahoor Ahmed nor was he in possession thereof. Respondents were the exclusive owners of plot Nos. 35, 57, 111 and 112 of Khata No. 99. 14.6. After tracing the trajectory of the s passed by the Consolidation Officer, appellate authority i.e. the Assistant Settlement Officer and the revisional authority i.e. the Deputy Director of Consolidation, the High Court noted that the Deputy Director vide the dated 20.09.1974 had confirmed the s of the lower authorities with respect to plot No. 115 of Khata No. 100 but had partly allowed the revision of the respondents with respect to plot Nos. 35, 57, 111 and 112 of Khata No. 99 as well as of Khata No. 98. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1867 Nisar Ahmad & Ors. v. Sami Ullah (Dead) Through Lrs. & Anr. 14.7. High Court vide the impugned and dated 05.01.2009 held that execution of the relinquishment deed in respect of the four plots of land i.e. plot Nos. 35, 57, 111 and 112 of Khata No. 99 was not denied by Zahoor Ahmed. It was a registered document and thus carried the presumption of genuineness. High Court further noted that the appellants had not questioned the genuineness and correctness of the relinquishment deed at any stage of the litigation.
