[Para 79] Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 – s.3(1)(r) – “with intent to humiliate” – Meaning: Held: Section 3(1)(r) should be seen in the context of Section 7(1)(d) of the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 wherein any insult against a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe on the ground of “untouchability” was punishable with imprisonment for a maximum term of six months – However, Civil Rights Act could not adequately tackle caste-based offences and [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1089 Shajan Skaria v. The State of Kerala & Anr. the practice of “untouchability”, leading to the enactment of the 1989 Act introducing more stringent provisions for combating such practices – The words “with an intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe” are thus, inextricably linked to the caste identity of the person who is subjected to intentional insult or intimidation and are inseparable from the underlying idea of “untouchability” which is sought to be remedied and punished by the 1989 Act – Not every intentional insult or intimidation of a member of a SC/ST community will result into a feeling of caste- based humiliation – It is only in those cases where the intentional insult or intimidation takes place either due to the prevailing practice of untouchability or to reinforce the historically entrenched ideas like the superiority of the “upper castes” over the “lower castes/untouchables”, the notions of ‘purity’ and ‘pollution’, etc. that it could be said to be an insult or intimidation as envisaged by the 1989 Act – The expression “intent to humiliate” in Section 3(1)(r) must be construed in the larger context in which the concept of humiliation of the marginalised groups has been understood by various scholars – It is not ordinary insult or intimidation which would amount to ‘humiliation’ that is sought to be made punishable under the 1989 Act – Humiliations based on different grounds and identities existing in the society targeted in different legislations like the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, discussed.
