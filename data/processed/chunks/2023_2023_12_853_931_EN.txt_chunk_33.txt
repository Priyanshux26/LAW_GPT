The successful party can demand : (a) the delivery of benefi t earned by the opposite party under the interim of the court, or (b) to make restitution for what it has lost. 11. In the facts of this case, in spite of the Karnataka Rare Earth v. Department of Mines & Geology, WPs No. 4030-4031 of 1997, dated 1-12-1998 (KAR) of the High 900 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. Court, if the appellants would not have persuaded this Court to pass the interim s, they would not have been entitled to operate the mining leases and to raise and remove and dispose of the minerals extracted. But for the interim s passed by this Court, there is no diff erence between the appellants and any person raising, without any lawful authority, any mineral from any land, attracting applicability of sub-section (5) of Section 21. As the appellants have lost from the Court, they cannot be allowed to retain the benefi t earned by them under the interim s of the Court. The High Court has rightly held the appellants liable to be placed in the same position in which they would have been if this Court would not have protected them by issuing interim s. All that the State Government is demanding from the appellants is the price of the minor minerals. Rent, royalty or tax has already been recovered by the State Government and, therefore, there is no demand under that head. No penal proceedings, much less any criminal proceedings, have been initiated against the appellants. It is absolutely incorrect to contend that the appellants are being asked to pay any penalty or are being subjected to any penal action. It is not the case of the appellants that they are being asked to pay the price more than what they have realised from the exports or that the price appointed by the respondent State is in any manner arbitrary or unreasonable.” (emphasis supplied) 326. In A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak, (1988) 2 SCC 602 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 372, this Court observed that it is a settled principle that an act of the court shall prejudice no man. This maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit is founded upon justice and good sense and aff ords a safe and certain guide for the administration of the law. No man can be denied his rights. In India, a delay occurs due to procedural wrangles. In A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak, (1988) 2 SCC 602 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 372, this Court observed : (SCC p. 687, para 102) “102. This being the apex court, no litigant has any opportunity of approaching any higher forum to question its decisions. Lord V. SENTHIL BALAJI v. THE STATE REPRESENTED BY 901 DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] Buckmaster in Montreal Street Railway Co. v. Normandin, 1917 AC 170 (PC) (sic) stated: ‘All rules of court are nothing but provisions intended to secure the proper administration of justice. It is, therefore, essential that they should be made to serve and be subordinate to that purpose.’ This Court in State of Gujarat v. Ramprakash P. Puri, (1969) 3 SCC 156 : 1970 SCC (Cri) 29, reiterated the position by saying : (SCC p. 159, para 5) ‘5.
