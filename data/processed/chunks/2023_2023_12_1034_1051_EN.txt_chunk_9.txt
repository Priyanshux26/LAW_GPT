An agreement to sell confers merely a personal right which can be enforced strictly according to the terms of the deed and at the time agreed upon. Proviso appended to Section 58(c), however, states that if the condition for retransfer is not embodied in the document which eff ects or purports to eff ect a sale, the transaction will not be regarded as a mortgage. (See: Pandit Chunchun Jha v. Sk. Ebadat Ali [(1955) 1 PRAKASH (DEAD) BY LR. v. G. ARADHYA AND ORS. 1047 [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] SCR 174 : AIR 1954 SC 345] , Bhaskar Waman Joshi v. Narayan Rambilas Agarwal [(1960) 2 SCR 117 : AIR 1960 SC 301] , K. Simrathmull v. S. Nanjalingiah Gowder [1962 Supp (3) SCR 476 : AIR 1963 SC 1182] , Mushir Mohd. Khan [(2000) 3 SCC 536] and Tamboli Ramanlal Motilal [Tamboli Ramanlal Motilal v. Ghanchi Chimanlal Keshavlal, 1993 Supp (1) SCC 295] . )” 32. The High Court relied upon Indira Kaur v. Sheo Lal Kapoor [(1988) 2 SCC 488 : AIR 1988 SC 1074]. Therein the Court took into consideration the factors adumbrated therein, particularly, a long stipulated period of 10 years for conveying the property and the vendee was prohibited from selling and parting with his right, title and interest for 10 years. The vendor was allowed to occupy the property as a tenant on payment of Rs 80 per month. No of mutation was passed in his favour. It was held: “6. … In the present case having regard to the facts and circumstances highlighted in the course of the discussion pertaining to the question as to whether or not the transaction was a transaction of mortgage having regard to the real intention of the parties it would be diffi cult to hold that the agreement to sell executed by the defendant in favour of the plaintiff was by way of a ‘concession’. It was a transaction entered into by the defendant who was a hard-headed businessman and the documents in question have been carefully framed in legal terminology taking into account the relevant provisions of law. The transaction also discloses the awareness of the defendant about Section 58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act as is evident from the fact that the reconveyance clause is not embodied in the sale deed itself. In the agreement to sell, no reference has been made to the transaction of sale though it has been executed contemporaneously. The defendant who has permitted the plaintiff to continue in possession on payment of rent equivalent to about 13½ per cent interest and was evidently aware of all the dimensions of the matter would not have granted any concession or executed the agreement by way of a concession. The agreement was executed evidently because the plaintiff would not have executed the sale deed unless an agreement to sell by a contemporaneous document 1048 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. was also executed to enable the plaintiff to enforce specifi c performance within ten years.
