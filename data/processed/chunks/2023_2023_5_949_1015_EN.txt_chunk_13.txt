It is submitted that accordingly, the High Court erroneously holds that if the unholy bond between the auditor and company is broken, either by removal or resignation, then Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 fulfils its purpose. It is submitted that according to the H UNION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER V. DELOITTE HASKINS 967 AND SELLS LLP [M. R. SHAH, J.] High Court, Section 140(5) of the Act is only attracted when despite the A petition by the Central Government, an auditor sets up a defence and opposes the petition frivolously and thus invites a final as set forth in the second proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013. It is submitted that on this basis, the High Court proceeded to hold that the petition filed by the Union of India under Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 has been B satisfied by the subsequent resignation of the auditor and therefore the petition under Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 filed by the Union of India is no longer maintainable. It is submitted that the High Court erroneously proceeded to quash Section 140(5) petition and the passed by the NCLT, Mumbai upholding its maintainability. C 3.2 Now insofar as quashing and setting aside the criminal proceedings, it is submitted that the respondents assailed Section 212(14) direction on two grounds. Firstly, on the ground that the issuance of the direction to prosecute within 30 hours of receipt of the IFIN SFIO Report demonstrates non-application of mind. Secondly, that the IFIN SFIO Report was an incomplete report as investigation had not been completed D and therefore Section 212(14) direction was incompetent. It is submitted that insofar as the first ground is concerned, the High Court erroneously holds that there is non-application of mind since it was improbable that a report of about 750 pages and 32000 pages of annexures could have been considered in 30 hours. Further, the High Court erroneously holds E that the relevant facts and documents to demonstrate application of mind have not been placed on record. It is submitted that while doing so, the High court also holds that the existence of a valid sanction can be appreciated in a writ Court and need not wait trial. 3.3 As regards the IFIN SFIO Report, it is submitted that the F High Court holds summarily and without even going into the same and erroneously holds that the SFIO Report is incomplete and lacking and therefore Section 212(14) direction is incorrect and/or invalid. 3.4 On interpretation of Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013, Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG has taken us to the legislative history and legislative intent of Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013. It is submitted that Section 140 G of the Act, 2013 is titled as “Removal, resignation of auditor and giving of special notice”. It appears in Chapter X of the Act which is titled as “Audit and Auditors”. Section 140(1) of the Act, 2013 provides for the procedure to remove an auditor by the company before the expiry of his term.
