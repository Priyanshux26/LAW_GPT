The Court is expected to pass an D promptly on the application which may be filed under Section 17 which may be of the same date as the application under IX Rule 13. Any delay on the part of the Court cannot prejudice the applicant. [Para 22][750-A-H; 751-A] 1.4 The appellants filed the application both under Section E 17 of the Act and under IX Rule 13 on the same day, namely, 06.05.2014. The application under IX Rule 13 is premised on knowledge of the ex parte decree being obtained on 05.05.2014 in the Execution Proceedings. There was no security offered on 06.05.2014. Though a direction as such was not F expressly sought for but permission was sought for to furnish security, it could be said that in substance the appellants essentially sought for direction within the meaning of the proviso to Section 17. The High Court was in error in finding that the appellants did not seek for dispensing with the security, and therefore, apparently holding the same against the appellants. G When the appellants sought for permission to furnish security, if the permission was granted and a direction to furnish security was given on the same date and it had been complied with within the time, then the appellants would have been compliant with Section 17. No s were passed on the application under H Section 17 dated 06.05.2014. Within 6 days, on 12.05.2014, the ARTI DIXIT & ANR v. SUSHIL KUMAR MISHRA & ORS 731 appellants on their own purported to furnish security. The surety A was the 7th proforma respondent in the appeal. The security was however, a shop. The shop was not owned by the surety. The Municipal Corporation, Lucknow was the owner. The surety was a tenant. A security to be provided under Section 17 by a surety is to be enforced under the provisions of Section 145 of the Code B of Civil Procedure as contemplated in Section 17 (2) of the Act. Section 145 of the CPC inter alia provides that the security provided by a surety can be enforced by effecting sale of the property. It has been held that the security provided by the appellants through the surety is not acceptable in law having regard to Section 17 (2) as the shop belonged to the Municipal C Corporation, Lucknow and it could not be sold for enforcing the surety. [Para 23][751-B-G] 1.5 While it is true that no was passed on the application under Section 17 on 06.05.2014, the fact remains that the appellants on their own furnished a surety as stated. The D High Court reasons that the security so provided was unacceptable on two grounds. Firstly, it was not furnished along with the application under IX Rule 13 on 06.05.2014. Secondly, it is found that it was not acceptable in law. [Para 24][751-G-H] E 1.6 It is true that the High Court in the dated 03.12.2015 proceeded to find that the “security was accepted by the court below”.
