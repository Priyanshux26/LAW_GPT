139 Bombay Slum Redevelopment Corporation Private Limited v. Samir Narain Bhojwani Tribunal, this Court, while dealing with the decisions under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act, in its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, has to be circumspect – By their own volition, the parties choose to go before the Arbitral Tribunal instead of availing remedy before the traditional civil courts – Therefore, the Courts must be very conservative when dealing with arbitral awards and confine themselves to the grounds strictly available under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. [Para 19] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – Bulky pleadings – Time-consuming submissions, leading to very lengthy awards – Bar to show restraint: Held: The arbitral proceedings have become synonymous with very bulky pleadings and evidence and very long, time-consuming submissions, leading to very lengthy awards – Moreover, there is a tendency to rely upon a large number of precedents, relevant or irrelevant – The result of all this is that there are very long hearings before the Courts in Sections 34 and 37 proceedings – In many cases, the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 are being treated as if the same are appeals under Section 96 of the CPC – When members of the bar take up so many grounds in petitions under Section 34, which are not covered by Section 34, there is a tendency to urge all those grounds which are not available in law and waste the Court’s time – The members of the Bar should show restraint by incorporating only legally permissible grounds in petitions under Section 34 and the appeals under Section 37 – Brevity will make the arbitral proceedings and the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 more effective – Arbitration must become a tool for expeditious, effective, and cost-effective dispute resolution.
