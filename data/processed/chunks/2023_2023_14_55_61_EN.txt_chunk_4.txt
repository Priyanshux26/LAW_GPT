Permitting the fi ling of successive petitions under Section 482 Cr.P.C. ignoring this principle would enable an ingenious accused to eff ectively stall the proceedings against him to suit his own interest and convenience, by fi ling one petition after another under Section 482 Cr.P.C., irrespective of when the cause therefor arose. Such abuse of process cannot be permitted. 12. In the case on hand, the fi ling of the charge sheet and the cognizance thereof by the Court concerned were well before the fi ling of the fi rst petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C., wherein challenge was made only to the sanction . That being so, the petitioner was not at liberty to again invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to the charge sheet and the 8 (2006) 1 MWN (Cri) DCC 1 = 2006 SCC Online Mad 94 BHISHAM LAL VERMA v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH 61 [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] cognizance at a later point of time. The impugned passed by the Allahabad High Court holding to this eff ect is, therefore, incontrovertible on all counts and does not warrant interference. The Special Leave Petition is devoid of merit and is accordingly dismissed. Before parting with the case, we place on record our appreciation and gratitude to Mr. S. Nagamuthu, learned amicus curiae, for his able and scholarly assistance. Headnotes prepared by: SLP dismissed. Ankit Gyan
