There is no doubt that conviction can be based on extra–judicial confession, but in the very nature of things, it is a weak piece of evidence. [Para 15][26-G-H; 27-A] 1.5 The trial court found the testimonies of PWs 10 to 12 E not to be reliable so as to base the conviction solely on the basis of such testimonies. Unless such a finding was found perverse, an interference therewith would not be warranted. [Para 16][27- F-G] 1.6 The Division Bench of the High Court has relied on the recovery of the blood–stained clothes and the weapon which F is alleged to have been used by the appellant in commission of the crime. The trial court disbelieved the recovery of clothes and weapon on two grounds. Firstly, that there was no memorandum statement of the accused as required under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, 1872 and secondly, the recovery of the G knife was from an open place accessible to one and all. The approach adopted by the trial court was in accordance with law. However, this circumstance which could not have been used, has H 22 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A been employed by the High Court to seek corroboration to the extra–judicial confession. [Paras 17, 18][27-G; 28-A-B] 1.7 The scope of interference in an appeal against acquittal is very well crystalised. Unless such a finding is found to be perverse or illegal/impossible, it is not permissible for the B appellate Court to interfere with the same. The view taken by the trial court could not be said to be either perverse or illegal/ impossible to warrant interference. The High Court grossly erred in interfering with the well–reasoned and of acquittal passed by the trial court. Thus, the impugned and passed by the High Court convicting the appellant for C the offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC is quashed and set aside.
