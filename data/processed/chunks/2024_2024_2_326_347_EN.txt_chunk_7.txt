Reliance is placed on Harmath Kaur v. Inder Bahadur Singh17. Further, reliance is placed on Mahadeo Prasad Singh18 to state that when there is an expectation simpliciter of succession, neither a transfer nor a contract to transfer is permissible. B. RESPONDENTS (i) The fact that the First Settlement Deed was acted upon i.e. the rights given to two sons of Thayammal were returned to her by a subsequent deed in 1952, shows that the first one gave rights in presenti. Therefore, in Saroja rests a ‘vested’ right as per Section 19 of the Transfer of Property Act, 188219, a vested right once accrued cannot be defeated by the death of the transferee prior to possession. Reference is made to Sreenivasa Pai v. Saraswathi Ammal (2-Judge Bench)20. (ii) The Second Settlement Deed reverting the life interest awarded to the two sons only gives Thayammal a life interest and therefore subsequent settlement deeds were non est in law and thus need not be challenged. (iii) So far as the non-seeking of relief within twelve years is concerned, it is submitted that the possession of the property was only available to Gopalkrishnan upon the death of Pavunammal (in 2004). Since a suit is pending, the limitation for seeking possession is arrested. The plea of adverse possession will be applicable only if the possession with the opposing party had become adverse on the date of the plaint. The learned counsel relies on Tribhuvan Shankar v. Amrutlal (2-Judge Bench)21. 17 AIR 1922 PC 403 18 AIR 1931 PC 1989 19 “TPA” 20 [1985] Supp. 2 SCR 122 : (1985) 4 SCC 85 21 [2013] 12 SCR 368 : (2014) 2 SCC 788 338 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (iv) The enjoyment of the property bequeathed on Raghavulu and Munusamy was in the nature of life interest. The Second Settlement Deed, therefore, is hit by Section 6(d) of TPA. They cannot convey a better title than they have received. (v) None of the conditions mentioned in Section 126, TPA for revocation/suspension of settlement are met in the present case, meaning thereby that the settlement cannot be revoked. (vi) Since the title to the properties stood vested in Saroja, Gopalakrishnan had cause of action to file a suit for declaration. The reason for filing of the suit in 1993 is a settlement deed executed by Pavunammal in favour of Vasantha. Since the former was alive the suit was filed without seeking the relief of possession. It is submitted that the proviso uses the term ‘further relief’ which implies that such relief had to be available on the date of filing the plaint which it was not as possession rested with Pavunammal therefore, a suit only for declaration was maintainable on the date of filing. (vii) Reliance on Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 is misconceived as the same is only applicable to wills covered by Section 57 (a) and (b) of the said Act i.e wills executed within the local limits of the civil jurisdiction of the High Courts of Bombay and Madras.
