F 2. From the impugned and passed by the High Court, it appears that it was the specific case on behalf of the appellant before the High Court that the possession of the land in question has been taken. Even in the writ petition before the High Court in para (c), the original writ petitioner had admitted that on 22.09.1997, the possession G of the agricultural land (land in question) has been taken. Despite the above and relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. Vs. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki and Ors., (2014) 3 SCC 183 and solely on the ground that the compensation has not been paid or tendered, the High Court has H UNION OF INDIA THROUGH LAND ACQUISITION 193 COLLECTOR v. RAJESH KUMAR AND ORS. [M. R. SHAH, J.] declared that the acquisition with respect to the land in question is deemed A to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013. 2.1 The decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. (supra), which has been relied upon by the High Court, has been overruled by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and B Ors., (2020) 8 SCC 129. In paragraphs 365 and 366, the Constitution Bench of this Court has observed and held as under:- “365. Resultantly, the decision rendered in Pune Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183] is hereby overruled and all other decisions in C which Pune Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183] has been followed, are also overruled. The decision in Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. [Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. v. State of T.N., (2015) 3 SCC 353] cannot be said to be laying down D good law, is overruled and other decisions following the same are also overruled. In Indore Development Authority v. Shailendra [(2018) 3 SCC 412], the aspect with respect to the proviso to Section 24(2) and whether “or” has to be read as “nor” or as “and” was not placed for consideration. Therefore, that decision too cannot prevail, in the light of the discussion in the present E . 366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under: 366.1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on 1-1-2014, the date of commencement of F the 2013 Act, there is no lapse of proceedings. Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of the 2013 Act. 366.2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding the period covered by an interim of the court, then proceedings shall continue as G provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the 2013 Act under the 1894 Act as if it has not been repealed. 366.3. The word “or” used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be read as “nor” or as “and”.
