Defendant Nos. 51 and 52 are the legal F heirs of defendant No.1. The appellants Cyrus/Goldstone/Trinity could not have had any claim, but for the purchase of 80% of undivided shares by HEH the Nizam, later impleaded as defendant No.156. Therefore, it is clear that the predecessors of the appellants rely upon these very sub- divisions, but the appellants negate the same. Thus, the appellants are guilty of approbating and reprobating. G 171. The predecessors of the appellants have had knowledge that faisal patti were recorded in the name of the claim petitioners in 1978 itself. Even the Receiver was aware of this, as seen from the letter written by the Receiver on 09.04.1980 to the Collector. Yet the Receiver informed the Court that possession of the land in Survey No.172 could H 358 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A be granted to defendant Nos.157 and 206. The report of the Receiver- cum-Commissioner in this regard and the passed thereon by the Court dated 20.01.1984 for handing over possession, is shocking, in the light of the fact that the Receiver himself recorded in his letter dated 09.04.1980 that faisal patti stood in the name of the claim petitioners. Therefore, it is too late in the day for the appellants B to question as to how the claim of the claim petitioners stood established. We accordingly answer this issue No. (v) in favour of the claim petitioners. Issue No. (vi) : Whether the State of Telangana has any legitimate claim C and whether any such claim would still survive after a series of setbacks to the State Government in the Court room? 172. In paragraph 244 of the impugned , the High Court recorded a finding that pattas were granted to cultivating Ryots prior to 1948 and that therefore the land did not vest in the State Government after the Hyderabad Jagir Abolition Regulations. The High Court went D on to hold further that the Revenue Department of the subsequent State Government accepted these pattas as genuine and implemented the sethwar issued in 1947 and faisal patti issued in 1978-79. 173. Following the aforesaid finding, the High Court declared in paragraph 414(d) that the land did not vest in the State Government E after the Hyderabad Jagir Abolition Regulations. Aggrieved by such a finding and conclusion, the State of Telangana originally came up with an application in I.A. No. 75869 of 2022 to implead themselves as parties to SLP (Civil) Nos. 2373-2377 of 2020. But subsequently, the State has filed an independent appeal in SLP (Diary) No. 19266 of 2022. F Therefore, the application for impleadment is unnecessary and hence it is dismissed. 174. Coming to the appeal filed by the State of Telangana, it is seen from the impugned that the State was not a party before the Division Bench of the High Court. Therefore, the aforesaid findings G are not binding upon the State of Telangana. In fact, the State of Telangana need not have filed any appeals against the impugned , as the declaration in paragraph 414(d) should be understood as a finding with regard to the claim of the claim petitioners qua the appellants.
