There is no dispute to the ratio laid down in the above case that the authorities had the power of punishment/dismissal/removal of the candidate in the event the enrollment/recruitment had been obtained by fraudulent means or on the basis of fake relationship certificate. 26. Similarly, the case of S. Muthu Kumaran vs. Union of India and Ors.5 is of no help to the respondents as the dismissal therein under the Army Act was on the ground of fraudulent recruitment which was 4 [2018] 1 SCR 679 : (2018) 14 SCC 279 5 [2017] 1 SCR 550 : (2017) 4 SCC 609 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 251 No.2809759H Ex-Recruit Babanna Machched v. Union of India and Ors. found to be proved and no perversity was found in the of the Tribunal affirming the dismissal which was modified/substituted to that of discharge. 27. In view of what have been said above and the legal position, as referred, the discharge/dismissal of the appellants is certainly invalid for want of non-consideration of the plea taken by the appellants. Accordingly, we have no option but to set aside the impugned s of discharge/dismissal dated 9.5.2013 and the (s) and (s) dated 06.03.2014 and 18.11.2015 passed by the Armed Forces Tribunal. The appellants shall be reinstated with all consequential benefits. 28. The appeals are allowed as aforesaid with no as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan Result of the case: Appeals allowed.
