To comprehensively address the submissions [2024] 12 S.C.R. 305 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. made before us, we find it necessary to address the following three issues: (i) What is the scope of Explanation 2 to Section 28? (ii) Whether the field of operation of Section 28(11) and Explanation 2 overlaps? In other words, what is the scope of the non-obstante clause in sub-section (11)? (iii) Whether Section 28(11) cures the defect pointed out in Sayed Ali (supra)? 143. Explanation 2 was introduced as a part of the new Section 28 enacted by the Finance Act, 2011 with effect from 08.04.2011. Explanation 2 to Section 28 reads as follows: “Explanation 2. - For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that any non-levy, short-levy or erroneous refund before the date on which the Finance Bill, 2011 receives the assent of the President, shall continue to be governed by the provisions of section 28 as it stood immediately before the date on which such assent is received.” 144. It was vehemently argued on behalf of the respondents that reading Section 28(11) with Explanation 2 narrows down the period for the purposes of retrospective validation of the show cause notices issued and limits the application of sub-section (11) to the period from 08.04.2011 (enactment of new Section 28) to 16.09.2011 (enactment of the Validation Act). This challenge is based on the reasoning that the non-obstante clause contained in Section 28(11) is limited to “…, decree or of any court of law, tribunal or other authority…” and does not oust the application of other provisions of the Act including Explanation 2. It was argued that the phrase “…this section…” in sub-section (11) when read harmoniously with Explanation 2 refers to the new Section 28 only and will not be applicable to the old provision as it stood prior to 08.04.2011. 145. The determination of the soundness of the aforesaid argument necessitates a comparison of Section 28, prior to the amendment and subsequent to the amendment. 306 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
