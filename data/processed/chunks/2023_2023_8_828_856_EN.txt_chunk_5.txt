K.B. TEA PRODUCT PVT. LTD. v. COMMERCIAL TAX 835 OFFICER, SILIGURI [M. R. SHAH, J.] manufactured product, i.e., 18.05.1999, since at that point of time the A definition of “manufacture” in Section 2(17) of the Act, 1994 included ‘blending of tea’. 5.2 It is submitted that subsequently, the definition of “manufacture” under Section 2(17) of the Act, 1994 came to be amended by the West Bengal Finance Act, 2001 and “blending of tea” came to be omitted B from the definition w.e.f. 01.08.2001. It is submitted that therefore, the appellant company ceased to be a manufacturer under the Act, 1994 and, therefore, was ineligible to avail the benefit under Section 39 of the Act, 1994. It is submitted that therefore, the Commercial Tax Officer, Siliguri Charge sought to amend the Registration Certificate of the C appellant company in terms of the amendment. 5.3 It is submitted that earlier the exemption was granted to the small-scale industrial units engaged in manufacturing activities. It is submitted that at the relevant time, pre-01.08.2001, and as per Section 2(17) of the Act, 1994, “blending of tea” was included in the definition of D “manufacture”. It is submitted that therefore, being manufacturers, the appellants were allowed the exemption. It is submitted that however, thereafter, in view of the amendment to Section 2(17) of the Act, 1994 w.e.f. 01.08.2001, “blending of tea” was excluded from the definition of “manufacture” and, therefore, the appellants ceased to be the manufacturers. It is submitted that once the appellants ceased to be the E manufacturers, the appellants shall not be entitled to the exemption as the exemption was available only to the small-scale industrial units engaged in manufacturing activities and to manufacturer under the Act, 1994. 5.4 It is submitted that when the legislature in its wisdom, excluded F “tea blending” from the definition of “manufacture”, therefore, “tea blending” cannot be regarded as a manufacturing activity entitled to enjoy exemption as provided by Section 39 of the Act, 1994. It is submitted that the submission on behalf of the appellants on legitimate expectation and that by amending Section 2(17) “vested right” in favour of the G appellants could not have been taken away, has no substance. 5.5 It is submitted that as rightly observed and held by the High Court, this is not a case of “vested right” but a case of “existing right”. It is submitted that therefore, the existing right can be taken away. It is submitted that there cannot be any legitimate expectation against a statute. H 836 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 5.6 It is further submitted that to grant the exemption or not is a policy decision and nobody can claim the exemption as a matter of right. It is submitted that therefore, both the learned Tribunal as well as the High Court have rightly refused to grant the appellants any exemption from payment of sales tax which the appellants were being granted prior to 01.08.2001 being the manufacturers of “tea blending”. B 5.7 It is further submitted that this is not the case of retrospective operation, but it is a case of prospective withdrawal of an existing continuing right to get exemption of sales tax.
