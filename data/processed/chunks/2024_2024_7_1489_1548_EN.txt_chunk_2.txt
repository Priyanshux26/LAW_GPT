Digital Supreme Court Reports There is no express provision in the Advocates Act empowering the SBCs to levy fees, except for the enrolment fee and stamp duty, if any, under Section 24(1)(f), at the time of admission of advocates on the State roll – The decision of the SBCs to charge miscellaneous fees is contrary to the legislative prescription of the Advocates Act. [Para 70] Advocates Act, 1961 – s.24 – Charges other than the enrolment fee cannot be a valid pre-condition: Held: Admission on the roll of advocates is a pre-requisite for any person intending to practice law in India – At the time of enrolment, candidates have little agency but to pay the miscellaneous fees imposed by the SBCs to get enrolled – Non-payment of the fees means that a candidate cannot get enrolled on the State roll – Thus, all the miscellaneous fees collected from a candidate at the time of enrolment essentially serve as a pre-condition to the process of enrolment – Section 24(1) specifically lays down the pre-conditions subject to which an advocate can be enrolled on State rolls – Since Section 24(1)(f) specifies the amount that can be charged by the SBCs as an enrolment fee, the SBCs and the BCI cannot demand payment of fees other than the stipulated enrolment fee as a pre-condition to enrolment. [Para 79] Bar Council of India Rules – Rule 40 under Section IVA of Chapter II of Part VI: Held: Rule 40 under Section IVA of Chapter II of Part VI under the BCI Rules mandates every advocate borne on the rolls to pay the SBC a sum of Rupees three hundred every third year – The sum under Rule 40 can only be collected from advocates already admitted on the State rolls – Therefore, this sum cannot be collected from persons at the time of enrolment – It must be collected from advocates after they are admitted on the State roll. [Para 80] Constitution of India – Art.14 – Enrolment of advocates – Exorbitant Enrolment fees charged by SBCs – Substantive equality and manifest arbitrariness: Held: The burden of payment of enrolment fees and other miscellaneous fees imposed by the SBCs falls equally on all persons seeking enrolment – While the burden is facially neutral, it perpetuates structural discrimination against persons from marginalized and economically weaker sections of the society – In more than one way, the process of enrolment perpetuates a culture [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1493 Gaurav Kumar v. Union of India and Ors. of systemic exclusion and discrimination that impacts the entry of law graduates into the legal profession and even beyond – The right to pursue a profession of one’s choice and earn livelihood is integral to the dignity of an individual – Charging exorbitant enrolment fees and miscellaneous fees as a pre-condition for enrolment creates a barrier to entry into the legal profession – The levy of exorbitant fees as a pre-condition to enrolment serves to denigrate the dignity of those who face social and economic barriers in the advancement of their legal careers – This effectively perpetuates systemic discrimination against persons from marginalized and economically weaker sections by undermining their equal participation in the legal profession – Therefore, the current enrolment fee structure charged by the SBCs (Eg: the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa charges a cumulative fee of Rupees fifteen thousand from the general candidates and Rupees fourteen thousand five hundred from SC and ST candidates) is contrary to the principle of substantive equality.
