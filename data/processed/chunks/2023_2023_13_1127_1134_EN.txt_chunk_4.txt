The ATS is dated 31.07.1975 and the suit was fi led on 01.01.1981. The limitation for fi ling a suit for specifi c performance, as per Article 54 of the Schedule to The Limitation Act, 1963 is 3 years ‘from the date fi xed for performance or if no such date is fi xed, when the plaintiff has notice that the performance is refused.’ In Ghewarchand v Mahendra Singh, (2018) 10 SCC 588, it was observed that when deciding upon the question of limitation, it is mainly required to see the plaint allegations and how the plaintiff has pleaded the accrual of cause of action for fi ling of the suit. Apropos limitation, this Court observed, in Basawaraj v Land Acquisition Offi cer, (2013) 14 SCC 81 as under: ‘12. It is a settled legal proposition that law of limitation may harshly aff ect a particular party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes. The court has no power to SABBIR (DEAD) THROUGH LRS. v. ANJUMAN (SINCE 1133 DECEASED) THROUGH LRS. [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] extend the period of limitation on equitable grounds. “A result fl owing from a statutory provision is never an evil. A court has no power to ignore that provision to relieve what it considers a distress resulting from its operation.” The statutory provision may cause hardship or inconvenience to a particular party but the court has no choice but to enforce it giving full eff ect to the same. The legal maxim dura lex sed lex which means “the law is hard but it is the law”, stands attracted in such a situation. It has consistently been held that, “inconvenience is not” a decisive factor to be considered while interpreting a statute. 13. The statute of limitation is founded on public policy, its aim being to secure peace in the community, to suppress fraud and perjury, to quicken diligence and to prevent oppression. It seeks to bury all acts of the past which have not been agitated unexplainably and have from lapse of time become stale. According to Halsbury’s Laws of England, Vol. 28, p. 266: “605. Policy of the Limitation Acts.—The courts have expressed at least three diff ering reasons supporting the existence of statutes of limitations namely, (1) that long dormant claims have more of cruelty than justice in them, (2) that a defendant might have lost the evidence to disprove a stale claim, and (3) that persons with good causes of actions should pursue them with reasonable diligence.” An unlimited limitation would lead to a sense of insecurity and uncertainty, and therefore, limitation prevents disturbance or deprivation of what may have been acquired in equity and justice by long enjoyment or what may have been lost by a party’s own inaction, negligence or laches.
