(ix) That the Division Bench of Allahabad High Court in the case of Shyoraj Singh clearly erred while relying upon the case of Radhy Shyam to hold that the acquisition notifications are bad in law and that the urgency clause was wrongly invoked. That Radhy Shyam is not applicable to the lands acquired for integrated planned development project at hand and is clearly distinguishable on facts as the said was passed in the 1088 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports context of an acquisition for private purposes, serving private interests and the chunk of land was acquired in a standalone exercise for development of residential, commercial and industrial projects, unlike the present case where the acquisition is being done in the national interest for a project meant to create public infrastructure of huge magnitude. In this regard, it was submitted that Nand Kishore was distinguished in Radhy Shyam in the following terms: - “76. In Nand Kishore Gupta v. State of U.P. [(2010) 10 SCC 282] the acquisition was upheld because the land was urgently needed for construction of Yamuna Expressway and by the time the matter was decided by this Court, huge amount had been spent on the project. As against this, the exercise of power under Sections 17(1) and/or 17(4) for the acquisition of land for residential, industrial and commercial purposes, construction of sewage treatment plant and district jails was held to be legally impermissible in Raja Anand Brahma Shah v. State of U.P. [AIR 1967 SC 1081 : (1967) 1 SCR 373], Narayan Govind Gavate v. State of Maharashtra [(1977) 1 SCC 133 : 1977 SCC (Cri) 49], Om Prakash v. State of U.P. [(1998) 6 SCC 1], Union of India v. Krishan Lal Arneja [(2004) 8 SCC 453] , Essco Fabs (P) Ltd. v. State of Haryana [(2009) 2 SCC 377 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ) 537], Babu Ram v. State of Haryana [(2009) 10 SCC 115 : (2009) 4 SCC (Civ) 69] and Anand Singh v. State of U.P. [(2010) 11 SCC 242 : (2010) 4 SCC (Civ) 423].” (x) That this Court in Natthi v. State of U.P. & Ors.21 and Narendra Road Lines Pvt. Ltd. v. State of UP and Others,22 has dismissed the SLPs preferred against the s passed by the Allahabad High Court in the self-same acquisition while relying on the law laid down in Nand Kishore, wherein it was held that the acquisition in question in District Gautam Budh Nagar through YEIDA is for planned development and the 21 SLP(C) No. 014705-014710 of 2011 22 SLP(C) No. 17808 of 2010 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1089 Kali Charan and Others v. State of U.P. and Others subject lands are contiguous to the land parcels, which were acquired for the purpose of residential, industrial, amusement, etc. along with Yamuna Expressway. (xi) The attention of the Court was also drawn to the fact that the SLP in Natthi v. State of U.P. & Ors.23 was dismissed on 9th May, 2011, just a month after the decision of Radhy Shyam which was delivered on 15th April, 2011.
