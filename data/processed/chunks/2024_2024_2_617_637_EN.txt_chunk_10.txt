Thereafter, vide letter dated 08.04.2003 the resignation dated 25.03.2003 was accepted from a prospective date ‘unilaterally’ using the words “final, binding and irrevocable.” 20. The in Rev. Oswald (supra) was relied upon in the impugned to say that facts of the instant case are similar. In our view, the case of Rev. Oswald (supra) was a case in which unconditional deed of resignation was executed before the witnesses and sent to the Bishop’s Secretary with an understanding of postponing the formal acceptance until the future date. The resignation deed so executed before witnesses was unilaterally withdrawn by the Vicar, therefore, the House of Lords held that the resignation was voluntary, absolute, validly executed and irrevocable. 21. In the case at hand, the unconditional resignation waiving the requirement of six months’ notice as demanded by the Trust was not submitted by the appellant. Without prior consent, the acceptance of resignation vide letter dated 08.04.2003 using the words final, binding and irrevocable was unilateral. In the subsequent letter dated 632 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 11.08.2003, acceptance of the words “final, binding and irrevocable” was not expressly made. In fact, it was in the context of the wordings of the letter dated 08.04.2003 extracted hereinabove. The averments in the letter dated 11.08.2003, which is after date of acceptance of resignation also does not disclose any implied agreement to the contents of the letter dated 08.04.2003. From above discussion, in our view, we cannot accept the said line of reasonings recorded by three fora. Therefore, in our view, the of Rev. Oswald (supra) does not apply to the facts of the present case. Thus, dismissal of the petition of appellant on similarity of facts with the case of Rev. Oswald (supra) is not correct and such findings by three for are unsustainable. In our view, on the facts of this case, the ratio of the of the Constitutional Bench in the case of Gopal Chandra Misra (supra) applies in full force. 22. Our said view is further fortified by the of this Court in Balram Gupta (supra), wherein reiterating the view taken in “Raj Kumar Vs. Union of India, AIR 1969 SC 180”, this Court held that till the resignation is accepted by the Competent Authority in consonance with the rules governing the acceptance, the employee has the ‘locus poenitentiae’, but not thereafter. On the facts referred hereinabove of the present case, the withdrawal of the resignation was made two weeks prior to the effective date, i.e., on 09.09.2003, however, the appellant was having locus to withdraw the resignation prior to the effective date of resignation. 23. In a later of this Court in Srikantha S.M. (supra), the principle of “vinculum juris” has been propounded, paras 26 and 27 whereof, are relevant therefore, reproduced as thus – "26. On the basis of the above decisions, in our opinion, the learned counsel for the appellant is right in contending that though the respondent Company had accepted the resignation of the appellant on 4-1-1993 and was ed to be relieved on that day, by a subsequent letter, he was granted casual leave from 5-1-1993 to 13-1-1993.
