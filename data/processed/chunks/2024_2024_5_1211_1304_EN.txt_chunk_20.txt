3.6. Relying on these two decisions, the present respondent- landowners approached the High Court from 2014 to 2017 seeking declaration(s) that the acquisition proceedings initiated by GNCTD had lapsed because of non-payment of compensation or non-taking of possession. Following the dictum in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association (supra), the High Court allowed the landowners’ claim and declared the acquisition proceedings as 2 [2014] 1 SCR 783 : (2014) 3 SCC 183, para 17. 3 The contingencies being, when landowners do not give consent to receive compensation, there is no person competent to alienate the land, or there is dispute regarding title to receive the compensation. 4 [2014] 7 SCR 799 : (2015) 3 SCC 353, para 11. 1236 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports lapsed. The appellants preferred SLPs against some of these s, many of which were in turn dismissed by this Court either in limine or after granting leave. 3.7. However, a two-judge bench of this Court in Yogesh Neema v. State of Madhya Pradesh 5 doubted the correctness of Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association (supra). Relying upon the maxim “actus curiae neminem gravabit” (i.e., the act of court should not prejudice the parties), the bench referred for reconsideration the question of law regarding the effect of an of stay on possession under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act to a larger bench. 3.8. Similarly, another two-judge bench of this Court in Indore Development Authority v. Shailendra 6 doubted the correctness of Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and referred the question of law regarding the manner of payment under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act for reconsideration. 3.9. Both these issues were considered by a three-judge bench of this Court in Indore Development Authority v. Shailendra.7 The larger bench held, inter alia, that the term “paid” in Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act is to be read as “tender” of payment, i.e., an offer to pay. In case the compensation was tendered and the same was refused, it was to be interpreted as “paid”. Further, on account of various rules made under Section 55 of the 1894 Act, it was held that the term “deposit” in the proviso to Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act must be read to include a deposit of compensation with the Government Treasury, and not just with the Reference Court. The three-judge bench then held that Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) was per incuriam as it failed to consider the statutory rules made under Section 55 of the 1894 Act and as it also did not take notice of appropriate precedents for interpreting the term “paid”. Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association (supra) was also overruled in so far as it allowed landowners to unduly benefit from s of stay. 5 (2016) 6 SCC 387, para 6-7. 6 (2018) 1 SCC 733, para 23. 7 [2018] 2 SCR 1 : (2018) 3 SCC 412, para 216-217. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1237 Delhi Development Authority v. Tejpal & Ors. 3.10. It is in the aftermath of Shailendra (supra) that the appellants filed most of the present appeals, Review Petitions and Miscellaneous Applications seeking a favourable determination of their rights.
