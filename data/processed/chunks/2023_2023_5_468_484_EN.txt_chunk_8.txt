By the said document, it has proposed to supply 1425 MW to Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited (HPGCL) from 1980 MW (3 x 660 MW) Phase IV extension of Mundra Project. The representation given is that it will use either imported or indigenous coal. F 31. If the argument of the appellants is to be accepted that at the time of bid there was no assurance of domestic coal supply, then the contention of the appellants that AP(M)L is entitled to shortfall of 70% of the coal itself is contradictory. 32. In any case, even on facts, it is to be noted that the contention G is without substance. AP(M)L has offered to supply 1425 MW of power from its Phase IV extension of Mundra Project, having a capacity of 1980 MW. The PPA entered into between Haryana Utilities and AP(M)L is for 1424 MW. 33. The SLC(LT), in its meeting dated 12th November 2008, based on the recommendation of the Central Electricity Authority (“CEA” for H 480 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A short), Ministry of Power (“MoP” for short) had authorized the issuance of LoA for 1386 MW i.e. 70% of 1980 MW installed capacity of Phase IV extension of the Mundra Project. This was done in accordance with the provisions of the NCDP 2007. Insofar as the remaining capacity is concerned, the decision was deferred to be taken by the SLC (LT) in the future, based on the recommendation of MoP and other relevant B factors. 34. It could thus be seen that AP(M)L would be entitled to benefit on account of the Change in Law if there was any shortfall of 70% of the domestic coal as was decided to be allotted by the SLC (LT) in its meeting dated 12th November 2008, culminating in the Ministry of Coal C (for short, “MoC”) issuing a LoA dated 25th June 2009 and the Fuel Supply Agreement (for short, “FSA”) being signed by AP(M)L with CIL on 9th June 2012. 35. Undisputedly, the claim of AP(M)L is with regard to shortfall in the assured quantity of 70%, and not above that. D 36. From the passed by the learned APTEL, it is clear that it has been the consistent stand of the appellants that AP(M)L was in a position to generate and supply contracted capacity of 1424 MW out of the fuel linkage arising out of the FSA dated 9th June 2012 with Mahanadi Coal Field Limited (“MCL” for short). It has been its stand that AP(M)L E should use the entire domestic coal availability towards the contracted capacity of the appellants first, and then use the imported coal for the deficit to reach the targeted PLF. It has further been its stand that the entire domestic coal available should be accounted towards 1424 MW contracted to Haryana Utilities. F 37. In its reply dated 31st July 2017, Haryana Utilities have categorically stated thus: “Thus the actual coal received from MCL is required to be considered towards power supplied under Haryana PPAs for the purpose of relief under force majeure.” G 38.
