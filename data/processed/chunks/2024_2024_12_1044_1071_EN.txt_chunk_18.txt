Wherever there is a real likelihood that the judge would, from kindred or any other cause, have a bias in favour of one of the parties, it would be very wrong in him to act; and we are not to be understood to say, that where there is a real bias of this sort this Court would not interfere; but in the present case there is no ground for doubting that the Justices acted perfectly bona fide; and the only question is, whether in strict law, under such circumstances, the certificate of such Justices is void, as it would be if they had a pecuniary interest; and we think that R. v. Dean and Chapter of Rochester [(1851) 17 QB 1] is an authority, that circumstances, from which a suspicion of favour may arise, do not produce the same effect as a pecuniary interest.”” CONCLUSION: 38. As already stated hereinabove, the matter went to the High Court in revision. The High Court, by the impugned and refused to interfere with the same and upheld the dated 30th May 2008. The said impugned and was stayed by this Court vide dated 26th October 2010. 39. When we opened the sealed cover on 24th October 2024 and perused the dated 30th May 2008 passed by the learned Special Judge, it became clear to us that the learned Special Judge had acted in a predetermined manner. Though the and of conviction/ acquittal dated 22nd/24th February 2007 was challenged by both the State and Ran Singh in an appeal and which appeal was admitted, the learned Special Judge has observed that the and [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1071 Bharti Arora v. The State of Haryana of conviction/acquittal dated 22nd/24th February 2007 has not been challenged and has become final. It therefore reflects total non-application of mind. We therefore find that the dated 30th May 2008 passed by the learned Special Judge is also liable to be set aside on the said ground. 40. In the result, we pass the following : (i) The appeal is allowed; (ii) The and dated 14th October 2010 passed by the High Court in Criminal Revision No. 2194 of 2008 is quashed and set aside; (iii) The observations made by the learned Special Judge in the and of conviction/acquittal dated 22nd/24th February 2007 in paragraphs 49 and 50 stand quashed and set aside; and (iv) The notice issued by the learned Special Judge dated 26th February 2007 to the appellant under Section 58 of the NDPS Act and all subsequent proceedings including the dictated and typed on 30th May 2008 by the learned Special Judge shall stand quashed and set aside. 41. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
