12. As already noted, in the present case, several FIRs have been lodged in respect of the aff airs of the bank. This included three FIRs dated 11 and 12 August 2021, FIR Nos 525, 526 and 527 of 202, which were lodged by the auditor. These FIRs were lodged soon after the audit report dated 6 August 2021. At this stage, it would be material to note that the FIR which was lodged by the appellant was on 19 July 2019, prior to the date of the audit report. The narrow issue which falls for consideration in the present appeal 304 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. is whether the provisions of Section 81(5B) can be construed as preventing a share holder of the society such as the appellant, who was also an erstwhile director, from independently setting the criminal law in motion. 13. The respondents have submitted that the institution of the FIR by the appellant, which is based on the audit report, is in contravention of Section 81(5B). It is contended that only the auditor or the Registrar is empowered to fi le an FIR in terms of Section 81(5B). The substance of the respondents’ argument is that the procedure laid down under Section 81(5B) is a special procedure, and will prevail over Section 154 of the CrPC. To fortify their submission, the respondents have relied on the decisions of this Court in Jeewan Kumar Raut v. CBI5 and Jamiruddin Ansari v. CBI.6 14. The High Court was of the view that since the provisions of the 1960 Act are special in the sense that they govern co-operative societies in the state, the provisions of Section 81(5B) would preclude the registration of an FIR at the behest of a person, such as the appellant, who is a shareholder of the co-operative society. We are unable to accept the view of the High Court. Neither expressly nor by necessary implication does the 1960 Act preclude the setting into motion of the criminal law by any person other than the auditor or the Registrar. 15. Section 4 of the CrPC provides that all off ences under the IPC shall be investigated, inquired, and tried according to the provisions of the CrPC. Section 4(2) structures the application of the CrPC in situations where a special procedure is prescribed under any special enactment.7 Section 4 is extracted below: 4. Trial of off ences under the Indian Penal Code and other laws.— (1) All off ences under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter contained.
