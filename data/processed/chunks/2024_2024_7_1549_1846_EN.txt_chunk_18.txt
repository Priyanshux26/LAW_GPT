on the basis of royalty which is in addition to payment of royalty – Such levies could also be imposed under Entry 49 List II thereby making Entry 50 List II redundant which is not acceptable – There would be unhealthy competition between the States to derive additional revenue and consequently, the steep, uncoordinated and uneven increase in cost of minerals, subjecting the national market being exploited for arbitrage – Overall economy of the country would be affected adversely – This would lead to breakdown of the federal system envisaged under the Constitution in the context of mineral development and mineral rights – Overruling the in India Cement would mean that all s akin to India Cement’s case whether prior to or subsequent thereto, stand overruled irrespective of whether they are of High Courts or this Court – Thus, all States would once again start levying taxes on mineral rights under Entry 49 List II, thereby bypassing Entry 50 List II so as to not be bound by any limitation that Parliament had imposed by law on power of the States to levy taxes on mineral rights – Parliament would have to again step in to bring about uniformity in the prices of minerals and in the interest of mineral development so as to curb the States from imposing levies, taxes on mineral rights. [Paras 35.2, 35.3] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1573 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. Precedent – Typographical error in a of a larger Bench – If can be questioned by smaller Benches on the basis thereof: Held: (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.) s of larger Benches cannot be questioned by smaller Benches on the basis of an imagined “typographical error” – Entire must be read and understood including its under currents before negating it for what it stands – of a Court of law is not a piece of legislation but one pregnant with reasoning and it becomes the duty of a succeeding Bench considering a precedent to be cautious in opining something contrary on the premise of a “typographical error” in a of a larger Bench by failing to understand the import of the reasoning – Opinion of the majority in the Kesoram’s case is per incuriam as it failed to follow the dictum in India Cement on the basis of a “typographical error” where there was none.
