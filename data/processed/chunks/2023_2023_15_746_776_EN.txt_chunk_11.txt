: Canadian Eagle Oil Co. Ltd. v. Selection Trust Ltd., 1946 AC 119 at p. 140 (HL) 9 Cape Brandy Syndicate v. IRC, (1921) 1 KB 64 10 Ibid. M/S MODI NATURALS LTD. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF 763 COMMERCIAL TAX UP [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] Simply because one class of legal entities is given a benefi t which is specifi cally stated in the Act, does not mean that the benefi t can be extended to legal entities not referred to in the Act as there is no equity in matters of taxation….” 41. Yet again, it was observed: “It may thus be taken as a maxim of tax law, which although not to be overstressed ought not to be forgotten that, ‘the subject is not to be taxed unless the words of the taxing statute unambiguously impose the tax [on] him’, (Russell v. Scott11, AC p. 433). The proper course in construing revenue Acts is to give a fair and reasonable construction to their language without leaning to one side or the other but keeping in mind that no tax can be imposed without words clearly showing an intention to lay the burden and that equitable construction of the words is not permissible [Ormond Investment Co. v. Betts12 ]. Considerations of hardship, injustice or anomalies do not play any useful role in construing taxing statutes unless there be some real ambiguity [Mapp v. Oram13]. It has also been said that if taxing provision is ‘so wanting in clarity that no meaning is reasonably clear, the courts will be unable to regard it as of any eff ect [IRC v. Ross and Coulter [IRC v. Ross and Coulter14]’.” 42. Further elaborating on this aspect, the learned author stated as follows: “Therefore, if the words used are ambiguous and reasonable open to two interpretations benefi t of interpretation is given to the subject [Central India Spg. and Wvg. & Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Municipal Committee, Wardha15]. If the legislature fails to express itself clearly and the 11 1948 AC 422 : (1948) 2 All ER 1 (HL) 12 1928 AC 143 (HL) 13 1970 AC 362 : (1969) 3 WLR 557 : (1969) 3 All ER 215 (HL) 14 (1948) 1 All ER 616 (HL) 15 AIR 1958 SC 341 764 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. taxpayer escapes by not being brought within the letter of the law, no question of unjustness as such arises [CIT v. Jalgaon Electric Supply Co. Ltd.16 ]. But equitable considerations are not relevant in construing a taxing statute, [CIT v. Central India Industries Ltd.17], and similarly logic or reason cannot be of much avail in interpreting a taxing statute [Azam Jah Bahadur v. Expenditure Tax Offi cer18]. It is well settled that in the fi eld of taxation, hardship or equity has no role to play in determining eligibility to tax and it is for the legislature to determine the same [Kapil Mohan v. CIT19]. Similarly, hardship or equity is not relevant in interpreting provisions imposing stamp duty, which is a tax, and the court should not concern itself with the intention of the legislature when the language expressing such intention is plain and unambiguous [State of M.P.
