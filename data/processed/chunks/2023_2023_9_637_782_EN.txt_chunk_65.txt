KERALA STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD & 725 ORS. [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 167. In light of the impugned s of the Bombay High Court, A which are in appeal before us, MSEB by its Circular 684 dated 25 September 2003 allowed auction purchasers of closed/ sick industrial units to exercise either of the options as prescribed by Circular 518 dated 18 June 1993. However, an undertaking was required by the incoming consumers to unconditionally agree to pay the arrears of previous B owners in case the Supreme Court decided in favour of MSEB. 168. After the enactment of the 2003 Act, the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code, 2005 was framed under Section 50 of the 2003 Act. The regulations came into effect from 20 January 2005, and apply prospectively. Regulation 10.5 of the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code C provides that dues owed to the distribution licensee are charge on the property and as a statutory effect, the liability for the payment of electricity dues is passed on to the new owner/ occupier of the premises, albeit to a certain time restriction. Regulation 10.5 provides as follows: “10.5: Any charge for electricity or any sum other than a charge D for electricity due to the Distribution Licensee which remains unpaid by a deceased consumer or the erstwhile owner / occupier of any premises, as a case may be, shall be a charge on the premises transmitted to the legal representatives / successors-in- law or transferred to the new owner / occupier of the premises, as the case may be, and the same shall be recoverable by the E Distribution Licensee as due from such legal representatives or successors-in-law or new owner / occupier of the premises, as the case may be. Provided that, except in the case of transfer of connection to a legal heir, the liabilities transferred under this Regulation 10.5 shall F be restricted to a maximum period of six months of the unpaid charges for electricity supplied to such premises” 169. Presently, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Electricity Supply Code and other Standards of Performance of Distribution Licensees including Power Quality) Regulations 202176 have G been enacted repealing the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005. Clause 12.5 of the 2021 Regulations reiterates that any unpaid charges for electricity shall be a charge on the premises. 76 “2021 Regulations” H 726 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A 170.
