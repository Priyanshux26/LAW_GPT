It is brought to the notice of this Court that in furtherance of its decisions, as approved by the Impugned , the Govt. of Bihar has repealed the existing Rules and notified the Bihar Subordinate Engineering (Civil/Mechanical/Electrical) Cadre Rules, 2023 (the ‘New Rules’) vide Notification No. 1174 dated 07.03.2023. In compliance with the directions of the High Court, appropriate provisions for the grant of one-time age relaxations have also been made under Rule 8(2) of the New Rules. Further, the BTSC has cancelled the Advertisement vide notice dated 10.04.2023 and fresh requisitions have been sent by the Water Resources Department to the BTSC vide letter dated 21.03.2023 for selection against 2252 vacant posts for Junior Engineers in that department. 1354 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 18. Mr. Patwalia further contends that the completion of the selection process under the Advertisement, resulting in the Select List and in the Final Select List was consistently carried out with the rider that the appointments would be subject to the outcome of the pending litigation. He argues that while the Select List was partially set aside by the High Court vide dated 19.04.2022, the Final Select List was neither considered by the High Court nor published, and therefore, no right to appointment vests with the Appellants, making any claim to equity untenable. 19. At this stage, it is pertinent to note that while issuing notice, this Court vide dated 24.04.2023 directed the maintenance of status quo which has persisted till date. As per the most recent status report by the State, nearly 9,187 posts of Junior Engineers remain vacant, drastically affecting the day-to-day functioning of the State. As retirements are ongoing, the working strength is continuously decreasing and is currently at 11.7%. In recognition of the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, Mr. Patwalia has fairly stated before this Court that the State will abide by any appropriate direction given by the Court. 20. We have heard Learned Counsel for the parties and perused the record. 21. As evidenced above, the present case has a chequered history. Before the Advertisement was released, an amendment was brought to the Rules in 2017, more particularly to Rule 9, which restricted the eligibility criteria only to those candidates who possessed a Diploma from an institute approved by the AICTE. This amendment was prima facie contrary to the decision of this Court in Bharathidasan University (supra) which is solidified by the stand of the AICTE before this Court and their public notice dated 19.02.2022. However, despite this infraction, the Advertisement contained the same restriction, arbitrarily disqualifying persons like the Writ Petitioners from the selection process. 22. Thereafter, the first Select List that was prepared was partly set aside vide dated 19.04.2022 in CWJC No. 7312/2021 and the BTSC was directed to prepare a fresh Select List as under: “Accordingly, appointments made to extent in terms of Rule 4(A) of amending Rules, 2017 are set aside and the [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1355 Shashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. The State of Bihar and Others Bihar State Technical Selection Commission is directed to prepare afresh select/merit list granting 40% institutional reservation to all the diploma holders, who have obtained their diploma certificate from any polytechnic institutes recognized by AICTU and affiliated by State Board of Technical Institutions, Bihar, Patna within the State of Bihar.” 23.
