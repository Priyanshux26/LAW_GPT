It is then the burden of the award holder to furnish security, as required by the court’s s, to utilise the amount or to make an application for modification of the condition if it is unable to fulfil the same. 17. In furtherance of the above, we therefore reiterate that the deposit of Rs. 7.5 crores must be converted as on the date of such deposit, i.e., 22.10.2010, when the rate of exchange as submitted by the appellants was 1 euro = Rs. 59.17. 18. The second deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs pursuant to the High Court dated 03.06.2011 stands on a different footing from the first deposit. This did not permit the respondent to withdraw this amount till the completion of the proceedings. Hence, the amount cannot be converted as on the date of deposit as the respondent could not have benefitted from the same. This amount could be withdrawn only 58 C.A. 3867 of 2010. 320 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in 2016, pursuant to the Executing Court’s dated 24.08.2016. The respondent withdrew the entire deposit of Rs. 8 crores, along with the interest that accrued on this amount, on 10.10.2016. 19. From the above discussion on the first deposit, it is clear that the exchange rate on 22.10.2010 would apply to that extent and non- withdrawal by the respondent of Rs. 7.5 crores was in its own discretion and inaction. However, since the of 03.06.2011 permits withdrawal of Rs. 50 lakhs on the completion of the proceedings, that would be the appropriate date for determining the exchange rate. Here, the revision proceedings were complete on 01.07.2014. Hence, it would be appropriate to apply the exchange rate as on this date to convert the deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs. 20. Our conclusions from this can be summarised as follows: i. The statutory scheme of the Act makes a foreign arbitral award enforceable when the objections against it are finally decided. Therefore, as per the Act and the principle in Forasol (supra), the relevant date for determining the conversion rate of foreign award expressed in foreign currency is the date when the award becomes enforceable. ii. When the award debtor deposits an amount before the court during the pendency of objections and the award holder is permitted to withdraw the same, even if against the requirement of security, this deposited amount must be converted as on the date of the deposit. iii. After the conversion of the deposited amount, the same must be adjusted against the remaining amount of principal and interest pending under the arbitral award. This remaining amount must be converted on the date when the arbitral award becomes enforceable, i.e., when the objections against it are finally decided. 21. As per these conclusions, the first deposit of Rs. 7.5 crores must be converted as on the date of deposit being 22.10.2010. The second deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs as well as the remaining amount due under the award must be converted when the objections proceedings attained finality on 01.07.2014.
