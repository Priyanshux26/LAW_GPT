of Excess Profits Tax [(1955) 27 ITR 20 (SC)] and Gursahai Saigal v. CIT [(1963) H 784 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A 48 ITR 1 (SC)]; CWT v. Sharvan Kumar Swarup & Sons [(1994) 6 SCC 623]; CIT v. National Taj Traders [(1980) 1 SCC 370]; Associated Cement Co. Ltd. v. CTO [(1981) 4 SCC 578]). Francis Bennion in Bennion on Statutory Interpretation, 5th Edn., Lexis Nexis in support of the aforesaid proposition put forth as an illustration that since charge made by the legislator in procedural B provisions is excepted to be for the general benefit of litigants and others, it is presumed that it applies to pending as well as future proceedings.” 10.7 In the case of Girdhari Lal & Sons (supra), it is observed and held by this Court that once the primary intention is ascertained and C the object and purpose of the legislation is known, it then becomes the duty of the Court to give the statute a purposeful or a functional interpretation. It is further observed that the primary and foremost task of a court in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature, actual or imputed. Having ascertained the intention, the Court D must then strive to so interpret the statute as to promote or advance the object and purpose of the enactment. It is further observed that the ascertainment of the legislative intent is a basic rule of statutory construction and that a rule of construction should be preferred which advances the purpose and object of a legislation and that though the construction, according to the plain language, should ordinarily be adopted, E such a construction should not be adopted where it leads to anomalies, injustices or absurdities. On interpretation of the statute, it is observed in paras 17 to 21 in the case of Hindustan Bulk Carriers (supra) as under:- “17. If the choice is between two interpretations, the narrower F of which would fail to achieve the manifest purpose of the legislation, we should avoid a construction which would reduce the legislation to futility, and should rather accept the bolder construction, based on the view that Parliament would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result. (See Nokes v. Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries [(1940) 3 All G ER 549 : 1940 AC 1014 : 109 LJKB 865 : 163 LT 343 (HL)] referred to in Pye v. Minister for Lands for NSW [(1954) 3 All ER 514 : (1954) 1 WLR 1410 (PC)] .) The principles indicated in the said cases were reiterated by this Court in Mohan Kumar Singhania v. Union of India [1992 Supp (1) SCC 594 : AIR 1992 H SC 1]. INCOME TAX OFFICER v. VIKRAM SUJITKUMAR BHATIA 785 [M. R. SHAH, J.] 18. The statute must be read as a whole and one provision of A the Act should be construed with reference to other provisions in the same Act so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole statute.
