When a consumer buys an article, he buys it because it performs a specifi c function for him. There is a mental association in the mind of the consumer between the article and the need it supplies in his life. It is the functional character of the article which identifi es it in his mind. In the case of a glass mirror, the consumer recalls primarily the refl ective function of the article more than anything else. It is a mirror, an article which refl ects images. It is referred to as a glass mirror only because the word glass is descriptive of the mirror in that glass has been used as a medium for manufacturing the mirror. The basic or fundamental character of the article lies in its being a mirror. It was observed by this Court in Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan [(1980) 4 SCC 71 : 1980 SCC (Tax) 548 : AIR 1980 SC 1552 : (1980) 3 SCR 1109] which was a case under the sales tax law: (SCC pp. 75-76, para 7) “... In determining the meaning or connotation of words and expressions describing an article or commodity the turnover of which is taxed in a sales tax enactment, if there is one principle fairly well settled it is that the words or expressions must be construed in the sense in which they are understood in the trade, by the dealer and the consumer. It is they who are concerned with it, and it is the sense in which they understand it that constitutes the defi nitive index of the legislative intention when the statute was enacted.” That was also the view expressed in Geep Flashlight Industries Ltd. v. Union of India [(1985) 22 ELT 3] . Where the goods are not marketable that principle of construction is not attracted: Indian Aluminium Cables Ltd. v. Union of India [(1985) 3 SCC 284 : 1985 SCC (Tax) 383] . The question whether thermometers, lactometers, syringes, eyewash glasses and measuring glasses could be described as “glassware” for the purpose of the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947 was answered by the Orissa High Court in State of Orissa v Janta Medical Stores [(1976) 37 STC 33 (Ori)] in the negative. To the same eff ect is the decision of this Court in Indo International Industries v. CST, Uttar Pradesh [(1981) 2 111 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. SCC 528 : 1981 SCC (Tax) 130 : AIR 1981 SC 1079 : (1981) 3 SCR 294] where hypodermic clinical syringes were regarded as falling more accurately under the entry relating to “hospital equipment and apparatus” rather than under the entry which related to “glasswares” in the UP Sales Tax Act.” In the aforesaid , the question that arose for consideration was under what tariff item ‘glass mirror’ would fall, and glass screens fi tted in motor vehicles as wind screens, rear screens, window screens would fall under which competing tariff item. Adjudicating this question, this Court held that glass sheet after successive stage of processing undergoes a complete transformation to become a glass mirror and a diff erent commercial product with a refl ective surface.
