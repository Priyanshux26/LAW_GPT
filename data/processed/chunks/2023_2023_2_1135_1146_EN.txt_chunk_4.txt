He denied that Krishna B Shetty B performed Satyanarayan Pooja on 07.01.1985, after execution of the partnership agreement, but admitted that the Invitation Card (Exh.44) issued on that occasion bore his name. He also admitted his signatures in the assignment agreement dated 15.01.1985 (Exh.49). He denied that Krishna B Shetty was running the hotel as his own business in his individual C capacity and that he forcibly dispossessed him in January, 1986.

Upon consideration of the pleadings and evidence, the Trial Court answered the three issues framed by it as under: - D E F 13. The Trial Court held against the plaintiffs in so far as the ground under Section 13(1)(b) of the Act of 1947 was concerned, as the Advocate Commissioner’s second report (Exh.23) showed no trace of G a toilet having been constructed in the leased premises. However, as regards the ground raised under Section 13(1)(e) of the Act of 1947, the finding was otherwise. The Trial Court took note of the admitted execution of the partnership agreement dated 01.01.1985 (Exh.48), whereby the tenant accepted Krishna B Shetty as a partner in his hotel business. H YUVRAJ @ MUNNA PRALHAD JAGDALE & ORS. v. 1141 JANARDAN SUBAJIRAO WIDE [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] Further, the Trial Court noted that the Invitation Card (Exh.44) for the A Satyanarayan Pooja, mentioned the name of Hotel Ambika, the name of the tenant and the name of the new partner, Krishna B Shetty. The Trial Court also noted that the tenant admitted his signatures in the assignment agreement dated 15.01.1985 (Exh.49), whereby he had assigned his hotel business in the leased premises to Krishna B Shetty for ` 2,00,000/- and B accepted ` 50,000/- as earnest money. It was accordingly held that Krishna B Shetty was taken as a partner in the business initially but, thereafter, the business was sold to him for ` 2,00,000/-. The Trial Court observed that the original lease deed dated 22.01.1975(Exh.55) stated clearly in page 4 that the tenant would not assign the business and would not allow third persons to conduct the said business in any way nor C would he transfer the said business in any way in favour of a third person. The Trial Court then adverted to Section 15(1) of the Act of 1947, which provides that, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, the tenant would not be entitled to sublet or transfer or give on licence the leased premises and also the proviso thereto, which allowed the Government, D by way of a notification in the Official Gazette, to permit in any area transfer of interest in premises held under leases or a class of leases to such extent as may be specified in the notification. As the conditions of the proviso were not satisfied on facts and in the light of the clear prohibition of assignment in the lease deed, the Trial Court decreed the suit.
