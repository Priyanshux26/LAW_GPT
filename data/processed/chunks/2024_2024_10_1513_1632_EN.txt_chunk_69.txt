The right to information about routine ways to make life meaningful and be educated on the adverse effects of child marriage falls under Article 21. Children are entitled to be aware of their rights and the ill effects that marriage unleashes on them. The entitlement of the child flows from the right to education. Education cannot be restricted to pedantic and bookish classroom learning. The State certainly has an obligation to provide free and compulsory education to all between the ages of six and fourteen. The mandatory minimum prescribed by Article 21-A, however, cannot restrict the right of children to be informed of significant and life altering dangers. 193. In a litany of s, this Court has firmly grounded the right to education into our constitutional jurisprudence.269 While dealing with a PIL against physically and mentally challenged children being kept in jails, this Court in Sheela Barse II v. Union of India270 has recognised that it is the duty of the State to ensure the full development of a child’s personality. The articulation of the right to development of a child puts a positive obligation on the State to create conditions feasible and resources necessary for the full development of children. In addition to the rights tracible to Part III of the Constitution, the development of child is also a part of the Directive Principles of State Policy.271Article 39 stipulates certain principles of policy to be followed by the State. Clause (f) of Article 39 reads as follows: “(f) that children are given opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment.” 194. The duty of the State corresponds to the right to development of a child which is tracible to Articles 14, 19(1)(a), 21 and 15. The right 269 Unni Krishnan JP v.

Union of India & Ors. comprehends the ability of a child to exercise free speech, express authenticity and live a life of liberty and dignity. It falls on the State to ensure that children are informed of ways in which their life is likely to interact with society and the cautions to bear in the journey they chart out in life so that they may enjoy and exercise their rights under Articles 14, 15, 19(1)(a) and 21. 195. Child marriage is one such threat. Sexual conduct within this relation, or for that matter outside marriage, is another aspect of education and information.
