Finally, several authorities have held that the arbitration agreement ceases to have effect if the parties waive arbitration. There are many possible ways of waiving a right to arbitrate. Most commonly, a party will waive the right to arbitrate if, in a court proceeding, it F fails to properly invoke the arbitration agreement or if it actively pursues claims covered by the arbitration agreement.” 88. The aboveexplained examination does not arise in the language of Section 11(6A). That is to say, the legislature has not borrowed the language of Section 45 in Section 11(6A), which is limited to the G ‘existence’ of the arbitration agreement. VII. Limited Examination by Court under Section 11(6A) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 89. The limited scope of Section 11(6A) of the Act, 1996 has H been explained by a three-judge bench of this Hon’ble Court in Pravin M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 419 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [AJAY RASTOGI, J.] Electricals Private Limited v. Galaxy Infra and Engineering Private A Limited26 at para 17 placing its reliance on Vidya Drolia and Others (supra) wherein it was held that the existence of an arbitration agreement means an agreement which satisfies the requirements of both the Act, 1996 and the Contract Act, 1872 and when it is enforceable in law. The in United India Insurance Company Limited and Another B v. Hyundai Engineering& Construction Company Limited and Others27 was also relied upon in Pravin Electricals Private Limited (supra) to demonstrate that Section 11(6A) deals with “existence”, juxtaposed to Section 16 and Section 45, which deal with “validity” of an arbitration agreement. There indeed lies a distinction between the “existence” and the”validity” of an arbitration agreement. C 90. The UNCITRAL Model Law also supports a distinction between jurisdictional objections based on the alleged non-existence, invalidity, or illegality of the arbitration agreement, and jurisdictional objections based upon the scope of a concededly valid arbitration agreement. 28All issues of jurisdiction including the existence or validity D of the arbitration agreement can be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal, whether or not appointed through the intervention of the court under Section 16 of the Act, 1996. VIII. Interpretation of “Existence of Arbitration Agreement” E 91. In to determine the “existence of an arbitration agreement” under Section 11(6A), the Act, 1899 may not have a bearing owing to the reason thatat the pre-referral stage,if the document is not duly stamped/insufficiently stamped that does not render the arbitration agreement non-existent as discussed and ascertained earlier. The only consideration that the courts/judicial authority at the pre-referral stage F needs to follow is theprima facie existence of an arbitration agreement as referred under Section 7 of the Act, 1996 which provides: “7. Arbitration agreement.— (1) In this Part, “arbitration agreement” means an agreement by G the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which 26 (2021) 5 SCC 671 27 (2018) 17 SCC 607 28 UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (1985), with amendments as adopted in 2006,Availableat:https://uncitral.un.org/sites/uncitral.un.org/ files/media-documents/uncitral/en/19-09955_e_ebook.pdf H 420 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R.
