Learned counsel urged that Section 238 of IBC could not override Sections 173 and 174 of the 2003 Act, since the latter (i.e. the G Electricity Act) is a special enactment, and would prevail over the IBC, which is a later general law, dealing with insolvency. 8. Counsel urged that provisions of the 2003 Act (Sections 42, 45 and 56) and the 2005 Code (Clauses 4.3 and 6.15), prescribed the H 3Board of Trustees, Port of Mumbai v. Indian Oil Corporation, 1998 (2) SCR 774. 1234 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A mechanism for recovery of electricity charges. The 2003 Act being a ‘special Act’ with a non-obstante clause, would have an overriding effect over the ‘general’ IBC law. This mechanism for speedy recovery of electricity dues, had to be given full effect. Thus, the provisions of IBC and the priority of claims under it in liquidation proceedings, were separate and applied in respect of other amounts available for distribution, after B the recovery of electricity dues were permitted under the 2003 Act and 2005 Code. 9. Learned counsel also relied upon the decision of this court in State Tax Officer v. Rainbow Papers Ltd.,4 in which this court held that by virtue of a security interest created in favour of the government C for tax claims under the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003, tax authorities i.e., the government, was a secured creditor under the IBC. This court held that if a resolution plan excluded such tax or statutory dues payable to the government, it would not bein conformity with the provisions of the IBC and, as such, would not be binding on the State. D 10. Alternatively, the learned counsel submitted that electricity dues were also ‘security interests’ in favour of electricity service providers. He relied on the definition of ‘secured creditor’ which meant “a creditor in favour of whom security interest is created.”5 Such ‘security interest’ was defined under the IBC as: E “Right, title or interest or a claim in a property, created in favour of, or provided for a secured creditor by a transaction which secures payment or performance of an obligation and includes mortgage, charge, hypothecation, assignment and encumbrance or any other agreement or arrangement securing payment or performance of any obligation of any F person.”6 11. ‘Claim in a property’ section of the definition could be invoked when one secured payment or performance of any obligation under the law. Additionally, the term “transfer” was defined under the IBC to mean: G “Includes sale, purchase, exchange, mortgage, pledge, gift, loan or any other form of transfer of right, title, possession or lien.”7 4State Tax Officer v. Rainbow Papers Ltd., 2022 (13) SCR 808. 5 Section 3 (30), IBC. 6 Section 3 (31), IBC. H 7 Section 3 (34), IBC. PASCHIMANCHAL VIDYUT VITRAN NIGAM LTD. v. RAMAN 1235 ISPAT PRIVATE LIMITED & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 12. It was urged that a reading of the definitions of ‘security interest’ A and ‘transfer’ indicated that the intent of the IBC was to include, in the concept of ‘security interest’, all claims, including statutory claims arising in law, against the corporate debtor.
