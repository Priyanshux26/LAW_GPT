The Resolution Professional’s view appears to be that once an allottee seeks remedies under RERA, and opts for return of money in terms of the made in her favour, it is not open for her to be treated in the class of home buyer. This Court is unpersuaded by the submission. It is only home buyers that can approach and seek remedies under RERA – no others. In such circumstances, to treat a particular segment of that class diff erently for the purposes of another enactment, on the ground that one or some of them had elected to take back the deposits together with such interest as ed by the competent authority, would be highly inequitable. As held in Natwar Agarwal (HUF)(Supra) by the Mumbai Bench of National Company Law Tribunal the underlying claim of an aggrieved party is crystallized in the form of a Court or decree. That does not alter or disturb the status of the concerned party - in the present case of allottees as fi nancial creditors. Furthermore, Section 238 of the IBC contains a non obstante clause which gives overriding eff ect to its provisions. Consequently its provisions acquire primacy, and cannot be read as subordinate to the RERA Act. In any case, the distinction made by the R.P. is artifi cial; it amounts to “hyper-classifi cation” and falls afoul of Article 14. Such an interpretation cannot therefore, be countenanced. 115 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 9. In view of the foregoing reasons, the impugned is hereby set aside; the appellants are declared as fi nancial creditors within the meaning of Section 5(8)(f) (Explanation) and entitled to be treated as such along with other home buyers/fi nancial creditors for the purposes of the resolution plan which is awaiting fi nal decision before the adjudicating authority. The appeal is allowed in the above terms. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Nidhi Jain
