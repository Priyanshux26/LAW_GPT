Such proceedings would not be maintainable and would obviously be met by the plea of limitation under Article 137 of the Act 1963. 59. We once again go back to the facts of the present case. Even G according to the petitioner, the disputes arose between the parties in relation to the wrongful encashment of bank guarantee vide letter dated 16.02.2016 for Euro 201,793.75 (“BG”) and for wrongful imposition of liquidated damages to the tune of Euro 399,0240.10. We are at one with the learned ASG that this was the “Breaking Point”. What is more H 636 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A important is the fact that the respondent on 26.09.2016, deducted the amount towards recovery of the liquidated damages. The requisite amount was credited into the Government account in accordance with the instructions contained in the letter dated 11.08.2016. This was the end of the matter. To say that even thereafter, the petitioner kept negotiating with the respondent in anticipation of some amicable settlement would B not save the period of limitation. 60. In the aforesaid context, we deem fit to reproduce the entire letter dated 24.02.2016 addressed by the respondent to the petitioner. The letter reads thus: C “BY FAX Integrated HQs of MoD (Army) Master General of Ordnance Branch Procurement Progressing Organisation D Room No. 230, B Wing, Sena Bhavan DHQ PO, New Delhi – 110011 78953/SMG/GS/WE-4/PPO/D(MC)876 24 Feb 2016 M/s B&T Switzerland E PO Box 174, 3604 Thun Switzerland Fax : 0041 33 3346701 Local : 46088802 F CONTRACT NO. 78953/SMG/GS/WE-4 DATED 27 MAR 2012 FOR PROCUREMENT OF QUANTITY 1568 SUB MACHINE GUN UNDER FTP 1.

The plain reading of the aforesaid letter would indicate that B the disputes between the parties had cropped up way back in the year 2014 itself. This is evident by the date 24.10.2014 figuring in the aforesaid letter dated 24.02.2016. The letter indicates that after the disputes arose between the parties, the petitioner tried to offer its explanation and put forward its case vide letter dated 24.10.2014. The respondent by letter C dated 24.02.2016 clarified or rather informed the petitioner that the justifications put forward by the petitioner vide its letter dated 24.10.2014 were duly considered and thereafter, a final decision was taken for encashment of the liquidated damages. Therefore, the petitioner is not justified in saying that it continued to negotiate till 2019. The mere bald assertion in this regard is not sufficient as observed by this Court in Geo D Miller (supra). The entire history of the negotiation between the parties must be specifically pleaded and placed on record.
