151, CPC cannot be invoked if there exists a remedy made available by the CPC itself. [Para 92, 94, 96] Precedents – Decision when, per incuriam – Shailendra [3-Judge] case, declaring Pune Municipal Corporation’ case per incuriam – Correctness: Held: Shailendra [3-Judge] case declared Pune Municipal Corporation [3-Judge] case per incuriam without having the benefit of the caution sounded by the Constitution Bench in Vikramjit Singh’s case and Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community’s case though it considered in excess of 250 decisions – There is absolutely no scope for a Bench of three-Hon’ble Judges to declare a previous decision of a Bench of co-equal strength per incuriam – Shailendra [3-Judge] case, at the highest, could have doubted Pune Municipal Corporation case and referred it for decision by a yet larger Bench but could not have, by any stretch of reasoning, declared it per incuriam. [Para 74] [2024] 5 S.C.R. 957 Govt. of NCT of Delhi Through Its Secretary, Land and Building Department & Another v. M/s K.L. Rathi Steels Limited and Others Precedents – Decision when, per incuriam – Shailendra [3-Judge] case, if per incuriam: Held: There is absolutely no scope for a Bench of three-Hon’ble Judges to declare a previous decision of a Bench of co-equal strength per incuriam – Shailendra [3-Judge] case declared Pune Municipal Corporation [3-Judge]’s case per incuriam without having the benefit of the caution sounded by the Constitution Bench in Vikramjit Singh’s case and Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community’s case – Shailendra [3-Judge] case, at the highest, could have doubted Pune Municipal Corporation case and referred it for decision by a yet larger Bench but could not have, by any stretch of reasoning, declared it per incuriam – Same logic applicable to this Bench too – Following, the Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community’s case, and also having regard to the sense of judicial discipline and propriety, this Court restrains itself from declaring Shailendra [3-Judge] case as per incuriam notwithstanding the firm conviction in this behalf – Shailendra [3-Judge] case is not held to be per incuriam. [Para 74] Precedent – Precedent of a previous Bench – Maintenance of judicial discipline and propriety: Held: Supreme Court of India, a revered institution, is one Court which operates through separate Benches owing to administrative exigency and practical expedience – These Benches are essential to efficiently manage the diverse and voluminous cases that come before the Court and to discharge the solemn judicial duty for which the Court exists – Each Bench speaks for the Court as a whole, contributing to the intricate symphony of justice that defines the Supreme Court of India – Thus, the need arises for a Bench to be careful, cautious, and circumspect while being critical of a precedent of a previous Bench – Every Bench is supposed to bear in mind two overriding considerations – First is that of deference to the views expressed by a Bench in a primary decision and the other is maintaining judicial discipline and propriety if, upon threadbare consideration, it is found difficult to assent to the justification for such primary decision – In such an eventuality, dignity and decency would demand disagreement voiced by the subsequent Bench and reference of the matter to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice for constitution of a larger Bench which is not a critical observations and adverse comments in respect of the primary decision rendered by a coordinate Bench.
