In the facts of the present case, the said judgement squarely applies looking to the situation wherein the quantifi cation of loss has not been proved in the enquiry. Even otherwise, prior to passing of an of forfeiture of gratuity, opportunity of hearing has not been aff orded to the appellant. We acknowledge the view taken by the Full Bench in the said and reaffi rm the same. 26.The counsel for appellant also relied upon the judgement of B.R. Sharma (supra), in which the riotous behaviour of the employee was found proved. However, the said does not apply in the facts of the present case. Similarly, reliance was also placed on the case of Canara Bank (supra) wherein as per the Regulations of the Canara Bank, the withholding of the amount of gratuity to the extent of loss caused was permissible. In the facts of the present case and contents of Regulations and Circular of the Bank, the said being distinguishable, has no application. The learned Single Judge has correctly observed that as per the 1977 Regulations, compulsory retirement; removal from service which shall not be a disqualifi cation for future employment and dismissal which shall ordinarily be a disqualifi cation for future employment are distinct and separate punishments. The act of forfeiture of gratuity is not envisaged in the present case as the provisions are silent on the aspect of forfeiture in case of compulsory retirement. As per Circular No. 1563 dated 16.01.1997 of the Bank, in our view, the Division Bench erred in reversing the of the learned Single Judge. 27.Therefore, taking a wholistic view of the 1977 Regulations, 1979 Regulations, Circular dated 16.01.1997 and the facts on record, we are of the view that the present civil appeal deserves to be allowed. We affi rm the fi ndings of the learned Single Judge and set-aside the judgement rendered by the Division Bench. The appeal is allowed. No as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed.
