Pertinently, the direction issued to the appellant vide the of disposal of the writ petition did not specifically mention a time-frame within which the was to be implemented. 59. In view of the absence of a time-frame in the , much would turn on rule 21 of the Writ Rules.47 Having read the relevant rule, we presume that the learned Single Judge was aware of such a rule and, hence, refrained from stipulating a time-frame for compliance of the Court’s . Irrespective of any time-frame fixed in an , the direction contained therein would require compliance within the period stipulated in rule 21 if the person responsible for such compliance has notice of it even aliunde. 60. The question of the contempt petition being barred by limitation has to be decided keeping section 20 of the Act and rule 21 of the Writ Rules in mind together with what constitutes a “continuing wrong/ breach/offence”. Undisputedly, the contempt petition was instituted on 04th October, 2014, more than 5 (five) years after the (of which contempt had been alleged) was passed, i.e., on 05th March, 2009.

[2024] 7 S.C.R. 1113 S. Tirupathi Rao v. M. Lingamaiah & Ors. stipulated by rule 21 expired and ended on 03rd May, 2010, i.e., in accordance with section 20 of the Act. However, the first respondent has contended that the contempt petition was not barred by limitation since the act of the appellant in not implementing the direction for effecting mutation was in the nature of a continuing wrong. 62. The date on which service of the dated 05th March, 2009 disposing of the writ petition was effected on the appellant is not stated anywhere in the contempt petition by the first respondent. No such date is also reflected in the representations that the first respondent claims to have made on 11th May, 2009, 12th September, 2009, 22nd October, 2010, 16th August, 2012 and 05th February, 2014. It is also not seen from the appellant’s counter affidavit that he pleaded non-service of such .
