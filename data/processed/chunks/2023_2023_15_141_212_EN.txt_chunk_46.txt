The enduring rights theory attributes a degree of permanence to the power to promulgate ordinances in derogation of parliamentary control and supremacy. Any such assumption in regard to the conferment of power would run contrary to the principles which have been laid down in S.R. Bommai…. **************** ***************** 202 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. The Constitution has not made a specifi c provision with regard to a situation where an ordinance is not placed before a legislature at all. Such an eventuality cannot be equated to a situation where an ordinance lapses after the prescribed period or is disapproved. The mandate that the ordinance will cease to operate applies to those two situations. Not placing an ordinance at all before the legislature is an abuse of constitutional process, a failure to comply with a constitutional obligation. A government which has failed to comply with its constitutional duty and overreached the legislature cannot legitimately assert that the ordinance which it has failed to place at all is valid till it ceases to operate. An edifi ce of rights and obligations cannot be built in a constitutional on acts which amount to a fraud on power. This will be destructive of the Rule of law. Once an ordinance has been placed before the legislature, the constitutional fi ction by which it has the same force and eff ect as a law enacted would come into being and relate back to the promulgation of the ordinance. In the absence of compliance with the mandatory constitutional requirement of laying before the legislature, the constitutional fi ction would not come into existence. In the present case, none of the ordinances promulgated by the Governor of Bihar were placed before the state legislature. This constituted a fraud on the constitutional power. Constitutionally, none of the ordinances had any force and eff ect. The noticeable pattern was to avoid the legislature and to obviate legislative control. This is a serious abuse of the constitutional process. It will not give rise to any legally binding consequences.” 102. In the present case, the Telangana ordinance was promulgated on 17.6.2016. The Telangana State GST Act was enacted and received the assent of the Governor on 25.05.2017; it was brought into force on 01.07.2017. The state GST Act contained a savings and repeal law, which sought to save acts done, privileges and rights accrued under the repealed enactment, i.e. the State VAT Act. It was sought to be argued that once the State Legislature approved the ordinance and enacted the amendment, in conformity with it, the provisions of the Ordinance became part of the act. The question of legislative competence would not arise, because the mere confi rmation of an ordinance is within the competence of the State legislature. Since the law was introduced through a diff erent procedure, i.e. ordinance, the eff ect of THE STATE OF TELANGANA & ORS. v. M/S TIRUMALA 203 CONSTRUCTIONS [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] that law, empowering the VAT offi cials to reopen or complete assessments, was no diff erent.
