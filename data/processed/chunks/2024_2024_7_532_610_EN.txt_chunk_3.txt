[Para 56] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 537 Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors. Contract – Contractual disputes – Arbitrariness of State actions – Meaning and Import of – Test of reasonableness – Vice of arbitrariness – When attracted: Held: The question, whether an impugned action is arbitrary or not, is to be answered on the facts and in the circumstances of a given case – An obvious test to apply is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned act and if so, does it satisfy the test of reasonableness – Where a mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is no impediment in following that procedure, the performance of the act otherwise and in a manner which does not disclose any discernible principle which is reasonable, may itself attract the vice of arbitrariness – Every State action must be informed by reason and an act uninformed by reason, is arbitrary – To enthuse efficiency in administration, a balance between accountability and autonomy of action should be carefully maintained – Whether the public authority acted bona fide would be gauged from the impugned action and attending circumstances – The authority should justify the action assailed on the touchstone of justness, fairness and reasonableness – Test of reasonableness is more strict – Supporting an with a rationale which in the circumstances is found to be reasonable will go a long way to repel a challenge to State action – The reasons need not in every case be part of the as such – If there is absence of good faith and the action is actuated with an oblique motive, it could be characterised as being arbitrary – A total non-application of mind without due regard to the rights of the parties and public interest may be a clear indicator of arbitrary action – Another way to assess whether an action complained of could be termed as arbitrary is by scrutinizing the reasons assigned to such an action – However, the Court is not supposed to delve into every minute details of the reasoning assigned, but should only see whether the reasons were earnest, genuine and had a rationale with the ultimate decision – What is under scrutiny in judicial review of an action is the decision-making process and whether there is any element of arbitrariness or mala fide – Thus, the question to be answered in such situations is whether the decision was based on valid considerations.
