From the and dated 25.03.2022 of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay at Nagpur in WP No. 1787 of 2021. M/S OM GURUSAI CONSTRUCTION COMPANY v. 381 M/S V.N. REDDY & ORS. Appearances: Satyajit A Desai, Amit K Pathak, Siddharth Gautam, Abhinav K. Mutyalwar, Gajanan N Tirthkar, Vijay Raj Singh Chouhan, Ms. Anagha S. Desai, Advs. for the Appellant. Prashant Shrikant Kenjale, Sandeep Chopade, Uday B. Dube, Advs. for the Respondents. / OF THE SUPREME COURT K. V. VISWANATHAN, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. This case brings back to memory the classic words of Justice M. Hidayatullah (as the learned Chief Justice then was) in Mahanth Ram Das vs. Ganga Das, [1961] 3 SCR 763. Though it was in the context of the Code of Civil Procedure, dealing with the powers of a Civil Court, the following passage does repay study for the present facts too: “… Such procedural s, though peremptory (conditional decrees apart) are, in essence, in terrorem, so that dilatory litigants might put themselves in and avoid delay. They do not, however, completely estop a Court from taking note of events and circumstances which happen within the time fi xed. For example, it cannot be said that, if the appellant had started with the full money ed to be paid and came well in time but was set upon and robbed by thieves on the day previous, he could not ask for extension of time, or that the Court was powerless to extend it. Such s are not like the law of the Medes and the Persians….” (emphasis supplied) 3. The question which arises for consideration in this case is, on the facts herein, are we to construe Clause 2.22.0(ix) of the tender conditions as the law of the Medes and the Persians - rigid and unalterable, even if the justice of the cause warranted otherwise? 382 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 4. Clause 2.22.0 (ix) reads as under: - (ix) L-I shall submit the demand draft/BG or FDR additional performance security in the offi ce of the Executive Engineer, Lower Wardha Project Division, Wardha within 2 days of opening of envelope-2. This duration of 2 days will not be relaxed under any circumstances.
