Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that: a. The decision of this Court in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu & Anr12, dwelt with the importance of the post of Chief Secretary in terms of its sensitivity, responsibility and the rapport which is required between the Chief Secretary and the Chief Minister; 12 (1974) (4) SCC 3 466 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. b. The provisions of Section 45A(d) contain only a defi nition of the expression “Chief Secretary” and cannot be construed to be a substantive provision governing the appointment of the Chief Secretary by the Central Government; c. Section 45E of the amended statute which deals with the transfers and postings of the Group A offi cers under the auspices of the National Capital Civil Service Authority cannot encompass the Chief Secretary who is a ex offi cio part of the authority; d. The power under Rule 55(2)(b) of the Transaction of Business Rules has always been exercised by the Lieutenant Governor on the aid and advice of the NCTD Government; e. In terms of the third proviso of Rule 16(1) of the All India Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefi ts) Rules 195813, an extension to a member of the All India Service holding the post of Chief Secretary to a State Government can be granted for a period of not more than six months “on the recommendations made by the concerned State Government with full justifi cation and in public interest with the prior approval of the Central Government”; f. Reference to the State Government in the third proviso to Rule 16 of the AIS (DCRB) Rules 1958 can only mean the GNCTD bearing in mind the observations in paragraph 173 of the in the 2023 Constitution Bench. Thus, in the absence of its recommendation, which has to be backed by a justifi cation and in public interest, no extension can be granted unilaterally by the Central Government; g. No extension has been granted to the Chief Secretary in GNCTD even in a single instance over 30 years; and h. Apart from the three expressly excluded entries of the State List pertaining to Police, Public and Land, the Chief Secretary also deals with 110 other entries of the Seventh Schedule in the performance of his functions. That is why a recommendation for 13 “1958 Rules” GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI v. UNION OF INDIA 467 & ORS. [DR. DHANANJAYA Y. CHANDRACHUD, CJI] the appointment of the Chief Secretary has emanated from the GNCTD while the appointment is actually made by the Union Government. Hence, the proposed extension which is sought to be granted to the Chief Secretary is without the authority of law. 11.
