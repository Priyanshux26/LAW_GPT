The Certifi cate of 10.07.2021 produced on the date of the Personality Test was not accepted. 71.

However, the rectifi cation has not been considered. Interference with the decision of the Selecting Body – When permissible? 74. Could we fault this exercise of the UPSC in rejecting their candidature under the EWS Category, is the question that arises for consideration? We are constrained to conclude that we cannot fault the DIVYA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 77 [K. V. VISWANATHAN, J.] method adopted by the UPSC. This is for the reason that the UPSC has strictly acted in accordance with the mandate of Rule 13 read with Rule 27 & 28. They had an obligation to scrutinize the forms as uploaded with DAF-I. Rules 13, 27 & 28 of the CSE-Rules 2022 are to be read with the Offi ce Memoranda of 19.01.2019 &31.01.2019 especially clause 5 of the Offi ce Memorandum of 31.01.2019. The examining body has not considered the defects as insignifi cant.
