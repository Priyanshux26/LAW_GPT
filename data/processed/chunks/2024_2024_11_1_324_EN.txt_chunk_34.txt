Article 31-C was inserted into the Constitution by Section 3 of the Constitution (Twenty-Fifth Amendment) Act, 1971. At the time of its inclusion in the Constitution, it read as follows: “31C. Saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles. – Notwithstanding anything contained in article 13, no law giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles specified in clause (b) or clause (c) of article 39 shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article 14, article 19 or article 31; and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving [2024] 11 S.C.R. 47 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy: Provided that when such law is made by the Legislature of a State, the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration of the President, has received his assent.” 37. Article 31-C, along with Article 31-A, was challenged in Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala.32 In the decision in that case, a majority comprising of seven of the thirteen judges consisting of Justices KK Mathew, AN Ray, DG Palekar, HR Khanna, YV Chandrachud, MH Beg, and SN Dwivedi upheld the constitutional validity of the first part of Article 31-C which provided immunity from challenges under Article 14, Article 19, and Article 31 to laws giving effect to the Directive Principles set out in clauses (b) or (c) of Article 39.33 In the case of six of the Judges (Mathew, Ray, Palekar, Chandrachud, Beg, and Dwivedi JJ), this flowed from their reasoning that Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution was unbounded and courts could not judicially review the validity of a constitutional amendment even if it modified the application of fundamental rights. Justice Khanna, however, did not subscribe to the view that Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution was unlimited.34 Nonetheless, on an independent analysis of Article 31-C, Justice Khanna found that the first part of Article 31-C which immunised laws from Article 14, Article 19, and Article 31 challenges did not violate the basic structure of the Constitution.35 38. In Kesavananda Bharati, there also arose substantial disagreement concerning the second half of Article 31-C which stated that no law containing a declaration that the statute gave effect to a policy furthering the principles in clause (b) or (c) of Article 39 could be questioned by a court on the ground that it did not in fact give effect to such policy.
