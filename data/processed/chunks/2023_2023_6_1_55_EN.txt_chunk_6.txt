PARDIWALA, J. B 1. As the issues raised in both the captioned appeals are common and the challenge is also to the self-same passed by the High Court, those were taken up for hearing analogously and are being disposed of by this common and . C 2. These appeals by special leave are at the instance of five under trial accused charged with having committed offences punishable under Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, ‘the IPC’), Sections 17, 18, 18B and 20 respectively of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (for short, ‘the UAPA’) and Sections 4 and 5 respectively of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 (for short, ‘the 1908 D Act’) and are directed against the passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh dated 26.04.2022 in CRA-D No. 47 of 2021 (O&M) by which, the High Court dismissed the appeal and thereby declined to release the accused persons on default bail under Section 167(2) of the CrPC. E 3. The seminal issues falling for the consideration of this Court may be formulated as under:- (i) Whether an accused is entitled to seek default bail under the provisions of Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, ‘the CrPC’) on the ground that although the chargesheet F might have been filed within the statutory time period as prescribed in law yet the chargesheet sans a valid of sanction passed by a competent authority is no chargesheet in the eye of law and therefore, it is as good as saying that no chargesheet was filed by the investigating agency within the statutory time period as prescribed in law? To put it G more succinctly, whether the Court concerned is precluded in any manner for the purpose of Section 167 of the CrPC from taking notice of the chargesheet that might have been filed by the investigating agency in the absence of a valid of sanction?
