Digital Supreme Court Reports concern for one and all. She prayed for issuance of appropriate directions. She submitted that in an age when children require internet access for educational purposes, it has become imperative to provide them with a safe online environment in accordance with Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). iii. Submissions on behalf of the respondent no. 1 / the Sole Accused. 27. Mr. Prashant S. Kenjale, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent no. 1 / the accused, submitted that the FIR was lodged for the offence under Section 14(1) of the POCSO and Section 67B of the IT Act, and thus, no error not to speak of any error of law could be said to have been committed by the High Court in passing the impugned . 28. He further submitted that the date of the receipt of the videos recovered from the mobile phone of the respondent no. 1 phone is 14.06.2019, at which point the 2019 amendment to Section 15 was not yet in force. 29. He further contended that the two files found from the Respondent’s phone were named (a.) VID-20190614-WA005.mp4 and (b.) VID- 20190823-WA0020.mp4. The use of “WA” in the file names indicates that they were automatically downloaded by WhatsApp, which has an auto-download feature, as shown in a research study. He would submit that in such circumstances, the said videos had been automatically downloaded onto his phone and that the respondent no. 1 was unaware of their existence. He argued that the forensic evidence clearly indicates both the creation and modification date as 14.06.2019, thereby indicating that the files were never accessed. 30. He further submitted that the mere possession of the aforesaid videos does not constitute an offence under Section 15(1) of the POCSO, as the respondent never had any intention to share or distribute them. He also argued that even if it is assumed that the respondent no. 1 had watched the said videos once and then failed to delete it, he cannot be charged under Section 15(1) of the POCSO, as he was unaware of its presence due to the government’s failure to publicize the law. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 187 Just Rights for Children Alliance & Anr. v. S. Harish & Ors. 31. He submitted that ignorance of law on the part of the respondent no. 1 was accompanied by a bona fide belief, and as such it would not constitute an offence under Section(s) 15 of the POCSO and 67B of the IT Act. In support of this argument, he placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in Chandi Kumar Das Karmarkar v. Abanidhar Roy, reported in AIR 1965 SC 585, and Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P., reported in (1979) 2 SCC 409. iv. Submissions on behalf of the respondent nos. 2 & 3 / the State. 32. Mr. D. Kumanan, the learned Counsel appearing for the State, submitted that the High Court, whilst passing the Impugned proceeded on an erroneous footing that an offence under Section 14 of the POCSO had been alleged against the accused, even- though both the chargesheet as-well as the quashing petition clearly mentioned that the indictment against the accused was under Section 15(1) of the POCSO.
