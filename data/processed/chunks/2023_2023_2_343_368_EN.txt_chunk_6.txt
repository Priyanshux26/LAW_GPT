The Court directed the Central Government to ensure that the entire programme framed by the Committee headed by Mr. Gopal Subramanium was operationalized and further directed C concerned institutions to fully cooperate with the Bar Council of India. 9. On the proceedings taking the aforesaid course, vide dated 18.03.2016 (hereinafter referred to as “reference ”), a three- Judges Bench of the Court opined that the questions which fall for determination in the present matter are of considerable importance D affecting the legal profession in general and need to be authoritatively answered by a Constitution Bench. The reference provided for three questions to be answered by this Court, as under: “1. Whether pre-enrolment training in terms of Bar Council of India Training Rules, 1995 framed under Section 24(3)(d) of the E Advocates Act, 1961 could be validly prescribed by the Bar Council of India and if so whether the decision of this Court in Sudeer vs. Bar Council of India & Anr. [(1999) 3 SCC 176] requires reconsideration. 2. Whether a pre-enrolment examination can be prescribed by F the Bar Council of India under the Advocates Act, 1961. 3. In case question Nos. 1 and 2 are answered in the negative, whether a post-enrolment examination can be validly prescribed by the Bar Council of India in terms of Section 49(1) (ah) of the Advocates Act, 1961.” G 10. There was resistance on part of some stake holders to hold the All India Bar Examination in W.P. (C) No.25 of 2021, W.P. (C) No. 987/2013, T.C. (C) No. 16/2011, 12/2011, 13/2011, 36/2011, 14/2011, 15/ 1 (1999) 3 SCC 176 H 352 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A 2011, 75/2012, 88/2012, 08/2012, 17/2011, 18/2011 and T.P.(C.) No. 692/ 2015, which have been tagged with the present matter. The case law debated before us: 11. There are three significant s whose implication was debated before us. The first is the of this Court in V. Sudeer2 B which discussed whether the 1995 Rules relating to entrants into the legal profession are within the competence of the Bar Council of India. The Bench recognised the exclusive and unfettered right to practice to a person enrolled as an advocate on the State roll. A conjoint reading of Sections 23, 29 and 33 clarifies that a person who is found qualified to be admitted as an advocate on the State Roll by satisfying the statutory C conditions under Section 24(1), will automatically become entitled to practice full-fledged in any court including the Supreme Court. Hence, the statutory conditions under Section 24(1) are satisfied unless a disqualification takes place under Section 24A of the said Act. The concept of pre-enrolment training was held to be not necessary. On various D grounds the 1995 Rules were held ultra vires the said Act and was, thus, invalid.
