The obligation to pay is complete by tendering the amount under Section E 31(1). The landowners who had refused to accept compensation or who sought reference for higher compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act. F 366.6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act is to be treated as part of Section 24(2), not part of Section 24(1)(b). 366.7. The mode of taking possession under the 1894 Act and as contemplated under Section 24(2) is by drawing of inquest report/memorandum. Once award G has been passed on taking possession under Section 16 of the 1894 Act, the land vests in State there is no divesting provided under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act, as once possession has been taken there is no lapse under Section 24(2). H 724 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 366.8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are applicable in case authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for five years or more before the 2013 Act came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending with the authority concerned B as on 1-1-2014. The period of subsistence of interim s passed by court has to be excluded in the computation of five years. 366.9. Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality C of concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of enforcement of the 2013 Act i.e. 1-1-2014. It does not revive stale and time- barred claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question D the legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.” 2.7. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority (supra), on merits also E the impugned and passed by the High Court declaring that the acquisition with respect to land in question is deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013 is unsustainable. 3. In view of the above and for the reason stated above the present appeal succeeds. The impugned and passed by the High F Court declaring that the acquisition with respect to the land is deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013 is accordingly quashed and set aside. Consequently, the original writ petition filed by respondent no.1 filed before the High Court stands dismissed. Present appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs. G Nidhi Jain Appeal allowed.
