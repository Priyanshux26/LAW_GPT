32. Even in the case of C.B. Dhall (supra) relied upon by the appellants, this Court while considering the purport of Rule 20B of the State Bank of India (Supervising Staff) Service Rules, 1975 held that under Rule 20B disciplinary proceeding, if initiated against an employee before he retires from service, could be continued and concluded [2024] 11 S.C.R. 821 State Bank of India & Ors. v. Navin Kumar Sinha even after his retirement and for the purpose of conclusion of the disciplinary proceeding, the employee is deemed to have continued in service but for no other purpose. 33. That being the position, we see no merit in the appeal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. Appellants are directed to release all the service dues of the respondent expeditiously and at any rate not later than six weeks from today. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
