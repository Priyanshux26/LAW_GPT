In that view of the matter, the High Court concurred with the finding recorded by the revisional authority and rightly dismissed Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 6635 of 1974 filed by the appellants. 23. In so far Writ Petition No. 18 of 1975 is concerned, the same was filed by the respondents, being aggrieved by the declaration made by the consolidation authorities that appellant would get half (1/2) share in the plots comprised in Khata Nos. 98 and 99 excluding 1874 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports plot Nos. 35, 57, 111 and 112 which exclusively belonged to the respondents. High Court took the view that consolidation authorities had erroneously proceeded to allot half (1/2) share to Zahoor Ahmed on the premise that the land was a joint family property. High Court held that the authorities were not justified in importing principles of Hindu law while determining the share of the parties who were admittedly Mohammedans. Thus, the High Court held as follows: I have given careful consideration to the three s of the authorities. I also perused copy of the lease deed dated 07.05.1922. A bare perusal of the said lease deed dated 07.05.1922 clearly shows that the said lease deed was taken by two persons, namely, Abdul Ghafoor, son of Allah Bux, and Mohammad, son of Satai. Abdul Shakoor, father of Zahoor Ahmed (Objector) was very much alive in the year 1922. He, according to the finding of the Deputy Director of Consolidation, died some time in the year 1930. It shows that the lease was taken jointly by Abdul Ghafoor, son of Allah Bux, and Mohammad, son of Satai. The said lease was not taken as joint family property by these persons. The concept of joint family property which is prevalent amongst the Hindus is not known amongst the Muslims. Abdul Ghafoor, son of Allah Bux, and Mohammad, son of Satai, were the only lessees and no other person. The authorities below misdirected themselves by considering the said acquisition of the property by Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad as joint acquisition for the family. So far as the validity of the lease in question is concerned, the same cannot be disputed by the contesting respondents Nos. 4 to 7 (petitioners of writ petition No. 6635 of 1974). It is not their case that the property was acquired by Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad in any other manner. It is also not their case nor established by them that the said property was acquired by Satai, the common ancestor, or by Abdul Ghafoor, father of Zahoor Ahmad, in any other manner. Source of acquisition of the said property is the lease deed in question dated 07.05.1922. In the revenue records in the basic year, names of Sami Ullah and Badlu (respondents Nos. 4 and 5) of the connected writ petition and of Zahoor Ahmad are recorded. Only dispute is with regard to the extent of their respective shares therein. The authorities [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1875 Nisar Ahmad & Ors.
