Did the PPA in the present case, require prior approval of the state commission 45.

A (i) generated from conventional Captive Generating Plant having capacity of 5 MW and above for his own use and / or (ii) procured from conventional generation through open access and third party sale.” 47. From a reading of the above provision, it is evident that there B was never any provision, which mandated prior approval by the state commission, of PPAs entered into, by parties, in exercise of their free choice, in relation to renewable energy sources.
