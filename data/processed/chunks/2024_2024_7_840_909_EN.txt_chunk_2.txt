[Paras 96-112] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 843 SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Krish Spinning Contract – Discharge of – Discharge by performance – Discharge by “accord and satisfaction” or by “full and final settlement” – Explanation of: Held: Contract between parties can come to an end by the performance thereof by both the parties, that is, by the fulfilment of all the obligations in terms of the original contract – This is discharge by performance – Alternatively, the contract may also be discharged by substitution of certain new obligations in place of the obligations contained in the original contract, and subsequent performance of the substituted obligations – Substituted obligations are referred to as ‘accord’ and the discharge of the substituted obligations is referred to as ‘satisfaction’ – This is discharge by “accord and satisfaction” or by “full and final settlement” in common parlance – Written confirmation of discharge by “accord and satisfaction” can also be in the form of a full and final discharge voucher or a No-Dues or a No Claims Certificate issued by one of the parties acknowledging that there are no outstanding claims and that such a party has received the full and final payment to its satisfaction – Concept of discharge of a contract by “accord and satisfaction” is embodied in s. 63 of the Contract Act, 1872, which provides that the promisee may, inter alia, accept any substituted obligation in place of the original promise made to him, and such acceptance on the part of the promisee would amount to the discharge of the contract – Once a contract has been fully performed, it can be said to have been discharged by performance – Once the contract has been discharged by performance, neither any right to seek performance, nor any obligation to perform remains under it – However, whether there has been a discharge of contract or not is a mixed question of law and fact, and if any dispute arises as to whether a contract has been discharged or not, such a dispute is arbitrable as per the mechanism prescribed under the arbitration agreement contained in the underlying contract. [Paras 40-42, 46, 47] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s. 16 – Presumption of separability – Doctrine of separability: Held: Arbitration agreement, by virtue of the presumption of separability, survives the principal contract in which it was contained – s. 16(1) which is based on Art.16 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, 1985 embodies the presumption of separability – Two aspects to the doctrine of 844 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports separability as contained in the 1996 Act are that an arbitration clause forming part of a contract is treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract; and decision by the arbitral tribunal declaring the contract as null and void does not, ipso facto, make the arbitration clause invalid – Fundamental premise governing the doctrine of separability is that the arbitration agreement is incorporated by the parties to a contract with the mutual intention to settle any disputes that may arise under or in respect of or with regard to the underlying substantive contract, and thus by its inherent nature is independent of the substantive contract.
