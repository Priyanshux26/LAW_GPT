It does not, however, confer authority to impose new prohibitions or to classify a duly licensed drug as contraband. Section 22(1)(d) is not a substitute for Section 26A of the D&C Act, 1940. While an Inspector may inspect premises, verify licenses, ensure proper record-keeping, and take action against specific offenses under the Act, the Inspector cannot supplant the Central Government’s prerogative by effectively banning a drug simply because of alleged misuse in certain quarters. 12. Similarly, even if the Respondent authorities are concerned about the high alcohol content of the tincture or its potential misuse by certain consumers, the D&C Act, 1940 and the rules framed thereunder provide mechanisms for addressing such issues without resorting to extra-statutory prohibitions. For instance, the authorities may ensure that licensees maintain proper records as mandated by the relevant rules; they may verify that a qualified pharmacist is present at the time of sale; they may inspect the premises regularly and take penal action if any license conditions are breached. If, upon gathering evidence and seeking expert advice, the authorities believe that the [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2111 M/s Bhagwati Medical Hall & Anr. v. Central Drugs Standard Control Organization & Ors. drug poses health risks serious enough to warrant prohibition, their proper recourse is to move the Central Government to consider exercising its powers under Section 26A of the D&C Act, 1940. Until such a notification is issued, the drug cannot be unilaterally banned at the local level. 13. By endorsing the characterization of the aromatic tincture of cardamom as a “prohibited article” without any notification from the Central Government, the impugned s of the High Court have effectively circumvented the legislative design. The High Court’s reasoning overlooks the clear distinction drawn by the D&C Act, 1940 between general regulatory authority and the special, centralized power to prohibit drugs. This approach also disregards the rights of a duly licensed trader who is entitled to carry on business in a product that remains lawful unless and until lawfully prohibited. Fundamental principles of administrative law, as well as the very structure of the D&C Act, 1940, demand that any restriction on a licensed medicinal preparation must rest on a firm statutory footing. 14. It follows that the impugned s dated 12.07.2022 and 22.09.2022 must be set aside. The Appellants, holding a valid license and acting within the boundaries of existing regulations, are entitled to resume their business of selling the aromatic tincture of cardamom and any other duly permitted medicines. The Respondent authorities, if genuinely concerned about misuse, may intensify lawful regulatory oversight, ensuring strict compliance with licensing conditions and quality standards. However, they cannot assume the power to declare the product banned or treat it as such in the absence of a notification under Section 26A of the D&C Act, 1940. The statutory scheme envisions uniformity, predictability, and legal certainty—values that would be undermined if local authorities could unilaterally impose prohibitions contrary to the nationally determined regime. 15. The civil appeals are allowed. 16. The impugned s dated 12.07.2022 and 22.09.2022 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Writ C No.13134 of 2022 and Civil Misc.
