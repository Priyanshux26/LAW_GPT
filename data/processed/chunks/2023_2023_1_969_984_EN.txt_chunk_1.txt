Besides this, it is unnatural and improbable that one as close a neighbour of PW-1 living 8-10 paces away would D not be aware that the boy went missing on 8.10.1999. [Para 19][978-E-G] 3. There is no explanation why PW-1, despite being told by PW-2 and PW-3 that they had seen A-3 taking victim ‘H’ in her house holding his hand, did not mention the involvement of A-3 E in the inquest proceedings. PW-7, who is witness to inquest, deposed about the presence of PW-1 to PW-5 during the inquest renders suspect the deposition of PW-2 and weakens the testimony of PW-5, who claims to have left the village on 09-10- 1999 and returned only on 12-10-1999. [Para 20][979-E-G] F 4. In circumstantial evidence cases, to sustain conviction, the panchsheel principles laid down in Sharad Birdichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra must be fulfilled. However, in present case, prosecution is not able to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. There are serious flaws in the testimonies of two sets of witnesses (PW-2, PW-3 & PW-4, PW-5) who deposed to seeing G the deceased with A-3 and the first two accused (A-1 and A-2), on 08.10.1999 and 09.10.1999, respectively. There are flaws in their testimonies regarding their presence at the place and time and with respect to the knowledge of PW-1. PW-1’s conduct, in not stating anything during inquest proceedings, despite being H JABIR & ORS. v. THE STATE OF UTTARAKHAND 971 informed about seeing the boy in the company of A-3 on A 08.10.1999, and later, on the early morning of 09.10.1999, by PW- 2, PW-3 and PW-4, undermines the prosecution story. The conduct of PW-4 and PW-5 in not taking any steps to ensure the safety of the child despite knowing the previous enmity or grudge on the part of the accused is unnatural. [Paras 21-22][980-C; 987- C-F] B Sarad Birdichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra [1985] 1 SCR 88– relied on. 6. The “last seen” doctrine has limited application, wherein the time lag between the time the deceased was seen last with the accused and the time of murder, is narrow; furthermore, the C court should not convict an accused only on that basis. In the present case, save the “last seen” theory, there is no other circumstance or evidence. The time gap between when the deceased was seen in the company of the accused on 09-10-1999 and the probable time of his death based on the post mortem D report is not narrow. Given this fact, and the serious inconsistencies in the depositions of the witnesses, and the fact that the FIR was lodged almost 6 weeks after the incident, the sole reliance on the “last seen” circumstance to convict the accused-appellants is not justified.
