B. PARDIWALA, J.] (ii) 08.06.2019 – arrest of the first and second Appellants; A (iii) 18.08.2019 – arrest of the third and fourth Appellants; (iv) 11.09.2019 – arrest of Taranbir Singh (Appellant of Crl. A. No. 1012 of 2023) (v) 17.09.2019 – extension of the period of investigation from 90 B to 180 days; (vi) 15.11.2019 – chargesheet presented; (vii) 14.12.2020 – application for default bail; (viii) 16.12.2020 – sanction dated 26.10.2020 under the 1908 C Act filed; (ix) 06.01.2021 – sanction was issued under the UAPA; (x) 17.03.2021 – sanction by the Ministry of Home Affairs under Section 45(1), UAPA following the transfer of investigation to NIA; and D (xi) 22.03.2021 – supplementary chargesheet has been presented by NIA. 6. In such circumstances referred to above, the Appellants (original accused persons) are here before this Court with the present appeals. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE ACCUSED E PERSONS 7. Mr. Colin Gonsalves, the learned Senior Counsel and Mr. Satya Mitra, the learned Counsel appearing for the respective appellants vehemently submitted that the High Court committed a serious error in declining to grant the benefit of default bail to the appellants. F 8. According to both the learned counsel, the chargesheet filed without sanction is an incomplete chargesheet and on the basis of such incomplete chargesheet no cognizance can be taken. It was submitted that the final report is filed so as to enable the court concerned to apply its mind as to whether cognizance of the offence should be taken or not. G The sum and substance of the submission canvassed on behalf of the accused persons is that there cannot be a part chargesheet. A chargesheet filed without sanction is an incomplete chargesheet and does not meet the requirement of a police report within the meaning of Section 173(2) of the CrPC. Such a chargesheet would also not be in consonance with sub section (5) of Section 173 of the CrPC. H 16 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 9. Such incomplete chargesheet cannot be used as a tool or device by the police to defeat an application seeking statutory/default bail. It was argued that a chargesheet filed under the UAPA must be complete in all respects. The emphasis put by both the learned counsel was on the fact that the sanction must accompany the chargesheet to enable the court concerned to take cognizance. B 10. It was further argued that mere gathering of evidence by the investigating agency is not sufficient when it comes to comparing usual criminal cases with the cases under the UAPA. The investigation cannot be said to be complete until the facts gathered are scrutinised by the authority appointed by the Central Government and such authority submits C its report. 11. Our attention was drawn by both the learned counsel to Rules 3 and 4 respectively of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) (Recommendation and Sanction of Prosecution) Rules, 2008 (for short, ‘Rules 2008’), which provide a time limit for making recommendation D by the authority and a time limit thereafter, for sanction of the prosecution.
