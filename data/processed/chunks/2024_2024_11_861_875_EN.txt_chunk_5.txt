Chandra Shekhar & Ors. 13. In the case of State of U.P. v. Mohd. Naim,6 in paragraph 11 this Court held thus: “11. The last question is, is the present case a case of an exceptional nature in which the learned Judge should have exercised his inherent jurisdiction under Section 561-A CrPC in respect of the observations complained of by the State Government? If there is one principle of cardinal importance in the administration of justice, it is this: the proper freedom and independence of judges and Magistrates must be maintained and they must be allowed to perform their functions freely and fearlessly and without undue interference by any body, even by this Court.

It has also been recognised that judicial pronouncements must be judicial in nature, and should not normally depart from sobriety, moderation and reserve.” (emphasis added) These observations must be borne in mind by every Judge. 14. In the case of in Re: ‘K’, A Judicial Officer,3 in paragraphs 7 and 8, this court observed thus: 6 [1964] 2 SCR 363 : 1963 SCC OnLine SC 22 870 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “7.
