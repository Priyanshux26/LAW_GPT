It is also a fact that the first respondent-insurance company got its office in Nainital or in other words it is conducting its business within the limits of Motor Accident Claims Tribunal at Nainital and the fact is that cross-examination of witnesses were done on its behalf as well. There cannot be any doubt with respect to the fact that the subject matter of claim is within jurisdiction of the Claims Tribunal, at Nainital. 32. For all these reasons, we set aside the impugned and dated 28.11.2016 passed by the High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital in appeal from No.414 of 2010 arising from the Award in MACP No.137/2006 and also the award dated 06.10.2010 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal at Nainital. To enable the Tribunal to proceed further and to decide the claim petition on merits, MACP No.137/2006 is restored into its file and in view of the long lapse of time there will be a further direction that the Tribunal shall conclude the entire exercise after permitting parties to adduce further evidence, if any, within a period of six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this . 33. The parties shall appear before the Tribunal either in person or through counsel on 20.05.2024 and thereupon, the Tribunal shall conclude the proceedings within the above stipulated time. In the peculiar circumstances to comply with the direction, the Registry shall forward copies of this to all the parties. The appeal is disposed of as above.
