30 years. 81. NTBCL contended that the impugned failed to account for: (i) the total user fee collected, considering only the provisional project cost of Rupees 377 crores; (ii) the interest on debt paid by NTBCL until March 2014; (iii) the repayment of the principal by NTBCL, which amounted to Rupees 280.36 crores; and (iv) other expenses of Rupees 22.9 crores and additional taxes, including MAT and FBT, totalling Rupees 50.42 crores. NTBCL argued that [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2039 Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd. v. Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association and Others since these amounts were not kept in view by the High Court, it still needed to recover an aggregate sum of Rupees 454.71 crores from user fees and other income, which was the computation of losses it had suffered as on 31.03.2014. 82. NTBCL further contended that it generated a revenue of Rupees 743.34 lakhs (out of Rupees 2028.88 lakhs) from the display of advertisement hoardings on the NOIDA side of the Project in 2019- 2020, which increased to Rupees 399.81 lakhs in 2020-2021. Out of this advertising revenue, Rupees 339.87 lakhs were paid towards license fees in 2019-2020, and Rupees 84.97 lakhs in 2020-2021. After the collection of tolls was discontinued, NTBCL became solely reliant on the revenue generated from advertisement hoardings. 83. We find that no independent evaluation of these competing claims is required to be undertaken by us as the issues raised by NTBCL have been effectively answered by the independent arbiter, namely the CAG, through its Report submitted to this Court concluding that: (i) The total expenses incurred by NTBCL are Rupees 1,136.26 crores. (ii) The total income generated by NTBCL is Rupees 1,103 crores. (iii) The Total Project Cost has been recovered to a large extent and only around Rupees 15 crores remained to be recovered as of 31.03. 2016. (iv) Other future recurring costs which would be incurred over the life span of the DND Flyway are the O&M costs. These are to be calculated as per the norms adopted in the Feasibility Study of the DND Flyway based on which the expenditure for the year 2015-16 can be reasonably estimated to be around Rupees 19 crores. 84. The sum of Rupees 1,136 crores, i.e. the total expenses incurred by NTBCL are based on the statutory accounts from 2001 to March 2016. This sum includes all the unrecovered project costs added before the date of commissioning of the Project and the inflated and unnecessary expenditures undertaken by NTBCL such as, travelling expenses, legal fees, extraordinary salaries and bonuses to employees, etc. as specified in paragraph 62 of this judgement. 2040 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 85. It seems to us that no person or entity can be allowed to make an undue and unjust profit from public property, at the cost of the public at large.23 In Mandsaur Transport Assn. v. State of M.P., when dealing with the aspect of the collection of toll to recover the costs of construction of a bridge, this Court held that there was no reason for the collection of the toll to continue if the State Government had recovered the costs of construction and maintenance several times over.24 This reasoning was reiterated in MSK Projects (I) (JV) Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan.25 86.
