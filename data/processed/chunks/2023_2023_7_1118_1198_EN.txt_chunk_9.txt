In the month of May, 2022, Form AA and Form BB were communicated by the party in relation to the election of Tamil Nadu Legislative Council. These forms were also signed by OPS and EPS, functioning jointly as Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator. B 6.6. Until the processes aforesaid, the Co-ordinator and the Joint Co-ordinatorappear to have continued to function intandemand in the spirit of joint leadership envisioned by the amended byelaws. Continuing as such, they issued a joint notice convening the meeting of General Council on 23.06.2022. This notice did not have any agenda or proposed C resolutions. However, with the issuance of this notice, a subtle simmering appears to have started within the party for return to the system of single leadership and this had been the trigger to the present litigation. It appears that on 19.06.2022, OPS sent a letter to EPS asking for adjournmentof the General Council meeting scheduled to be held on D 23.06.2022, which was replied in the negative by EPS. There had been a petition filed in Madras High Court for police protection at the meeting dated 23.06.2022. It is the case of EPS that OPS received the final version of resolution to be placed before the members of General Council by the Party Headquarters and he conveyed the consentfor the same.As noticed hereinbefore, the proposed meeting dated 23.06.2022 led to the E said three civil suits, being CS Nos. 102 of 2022, 106 of 2022 and 111 of 2022. In CS No. 111 of 2022, the plaintiff, Mr. M. Shanmugam sought the reliefs of prohibitory injunction against the party as also against the General Council, the Executive Committee, the Co-ordinator, and the Joint Co-ordinator, that they may not convenethe General Council meeting F proposed to be held on 23.06.2022. Two applications, OA Nos. 327 of 2022 and 328 of 2022, were also filed seeking temporary injunctionso as to restrain the defendants from placing any agenda in the General Council meeting to be held on 23.06.2022. Other OAs were alsofiled in the other civil suits but, for the sake of brevity, we are not expanding on them because the subject-matter essentially remains the same. G 6.7. The aforesaid applications with the prayer for interim and direction were considered by a learned Single Judge of the High Court on 22.06.2022. The learned Single Judge declined to pass any interim or to issue any interim direction; and the General Council meeting slated for 23.06.2022 was allowed to go on. The learned Single H Judge observed, inter alia, as under: - THIRU K. PALANISWAMY v. M. SHANMUGAM & ORS. 1131 [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] “13. This Court, upon hearing the learned respective counsel and A on-going through the entire record, finds that all the parties have reported no objection for conducting the General Council meeting to be held on 23.06.2022, however, the learned counsel appearing for the plaintiffs and 3rd defendant/Co-ordinator would strongly oppose to passing of any resolutions on the floor of the Meeting B regarding amendment of the Rules and Regulations of the 1st Defendant/Party, mainly, abolishing the posts of Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator as it would cause great prejudice to them.
