[1994 Supp (1) SCC 185 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 348]) In Tara Singh [1991 Supp (1) SCC 536 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 710] the Court made the following observations: (SCC p. 541, para 4) “4. It is well settled that the delay in giving the FIR by itself cannot be a ground to doubt the prosecution case. Knowing the Indian conditions as they are we cannot expect these villagers to rush to the police station immediately after the occurrence. Human nature as it is, the kith and kin who have witnessed the occurrence cannot be expected to act mechanically with all the promptitude in giving the report to the police. At times being grief-stricken because of the calamity it may not immediately occur to them that they should give a report. After all it is but natural in these circumstances for them to take some time to go to the police station for giving the report.” 12. Keeping in view the aforestated settled legal position, let us examine as to whether the delay of more than one year in the registration of the FIR was fatal to the case of prosecution or the prosecution had suffi ciently explained the said delay? 13. As transpiring from the record, the deceased Bisahu Singh was the husband of PW-2 Ganeshi Bai and father of PW-3 Anita Porte.
