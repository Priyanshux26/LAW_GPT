(2) Where such a notice is issued to any person, it shall be the duty of that person to comply with the terms of the notice. (3) Where such person complies and continues to comply with the notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the off ence referred to in 870 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. the notice unless, for reasons to be recorded, the police offi cer is of the opinion that he ought to be arrested. (4) Where such person, at any time, fails to comply with the terms of the notice or is unwilling to identify himself, the police offi cer may, subject to such s as may have been passed by a competent Court in this behalf, arrest him for the off ence mentioned in the notice.” 32. Due interpretation of this provision of utmost importance has been given by this Court on more than one occasion [Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273 and Satender Kumar Antil v. CBI, (2022) 10 SCC 51]. The Interpretation of this provision, meant to preserve and safeguard the liberty of a person, is taken note of in the afore-stated s. This provision cannot be termed as a supplement to Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002. The PMLA, 2002 being a sui generis legislation, has its own mechanism in dealing with arrest in the light of its objectives. The concern of the PMLA, 2002 is to prevent money laundering, make adequate recovery and punish the off ender. That is the reason why a comprehensive procedure for summons, searches, and seizures etc., has been clearly stipulated under Chapter V of the PMLA, 2002. An arrest shall only be made after due compliance of the relevant provisions including Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002. Therefore, there is absolutely no need to follow and adopt Section 41A of the CrPC, 1973 especially in the teeth of Section 65 of the PMLA, 2002. 33. In the absence of any mandate, one cannot force the Authorized Offi cer to ensure due compliance of Section 41A of the CrPC, 1973 especially when a clear, diff erent and distinct methodology is available under the PMLA, 2002. Following Section 41A of the CrPC, 1973 for an arrest under the PMLA, 2002 would only defeat and destroy the very inquiry/investigation under the PMLA, 2002. Till summons are issued to a person, he is not expected to be in the know-how. Any prior intimation, other than what is mandated under the PMLA, 1973 might seriously impair the ongoing investigation. 34. The Explanation to Section 45 of the PMLA, 2002 once again reiterates the role required to be performed by an Authorized Offi cer, duly fulfi lling the conditions adumbrated under Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002. The Explanation goes on to state by way of a clarifi cation that all off ences V. SENTHIL BALAJI v. THE STATE REPRESENTED BY 871 DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] under the Act shall be cognizable and non-bailable off ences, notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in the CrPC, 1973.
