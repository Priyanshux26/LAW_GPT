To buttress the said submission, she relied on Epuru Sudhakar, Swamy Shraddhananda (2) vs. State of Karnataka, (2008) 13 SCC 767, (“Shraddhananda”), and Jagdish. Reliance was also placed on the decision in Laxman Naskar wherein this Court had discussed the factors to be considered before granting remission. 7.9. It was urged that the prerogative power of remission is not immune from judicial review, vide Epuru Sudhakar wherein it was observed that judicial review of the of remission is available on the following grounds: (i) non-application of mind; (ii) is malafide; (iii) has been passed on extraneous or wholly irrelevant considerations; (iv) relevant materials kept out of consideration; (v) suffers from arbitrariness. 7.10. It was contended that in the present case, remission was granted to all the convicts mechanically and without application of mind to each of the cases andthat the relevant factors were not considered. That the State Government failed to consider the relevant material and make an objective assessment while considering the applications of the convicts for remission. The nature and gravity of the crime, the impact of the remission s on the victim and her family, witnesses and society at large, were not considered. That mere good behaviour in jail and completion of fourteen years in jail are not the only pre-requisites while considering the application for premature release of the convicts. 7.11. Attention was drawn to the fact that respondent No.3 herein had approached the High Court of Gujarat by way of Crl. Application No.4573 of 2019 seeking a direction to the State Government to consider his application for remission. The High Court vide dated 17.07.2019 dismissed the same in view of Section 432 of the CrPC. Respondent No.3’s second [2024] 1 S.C.R. 793 Bilkis Yakub Rasool v. Union of India & Others application was also dismissed vide dated 13.03.2020 passed by the Gujarat High Court. That infact, within fourteen days of the First dated 17.07.2019, respondent No.3 had approached the Government of Maharashtra by way of an application dated 01.08.2019. Upon his application, opinion was sought from the (i) Investigating Agency (CBI) and the (ii) Presiding Officer of the convicting court (Special Judge, Sessions Court, Greater Mumbai), both of whom opined in the negative and against remission being granted to the said respondent. Further, the Superintendent of Police, Dahod, vide letter dated 03.02.2020 gave a negative opinion by noting that the victim and her relatives stated that respondent No.3 should not be released. The District Magistrate, Dahod, also gave a negative opinion vide letter dated 19.02.2020, so also the Jail Advisory Committee at its meeting held on 20.07.2021. That it was thereafter that respondent No.3 approached this Court by filing Writ Petition (Crl.) No.135 of 2022 and by dated 13.05.2022 this Court directed the State of Gujarat to consider respondent No.3’s application within a period of two months from the date of the . 7.12.
