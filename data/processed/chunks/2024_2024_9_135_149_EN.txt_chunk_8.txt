In effect, the submission 1 [2014] 3 SCR 984: (2014) 12 SCC 106 [2024] 9 S.C.R. 147 Anantdeep Singh v. The High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh & Anr. is that the probationer’s service could be dispensed with without holding a formal enquiry or giving an opportunity to the probationer and the employer was well within his right to dispense the service of the probationer by conducting the preliminary enquiry to ascertain the suitability. In this connection, he has placed reliance upon the following s: .i State of Punjab vs. Balbir Singh;2 .ii State of Punjab and others vs. Sukhwinder Singh;3 iii. State of Punjab and others vs. Rajesh Kumar;4 iv. Bishan Lal Gupta vs. State of Haryana;5 v. State of Punjab vs. Sukh Raj Bahadur;6 and vi. High Court of Patna vs. Pandey Madan Mohan.7 17. Mr. Gupta, while further addressing on merits, submitted that it was not just the allegation of having illicit relationship with lady judicial officer but there were other very serious allegations which were unbecoming of a judicial officer and since the appellant was a probationer, the Full Court of the High Court found him unsuitable for continuing in service and accordingly he was dismissed from the service. 18. He further submitted that in the case of the lady judicial officer whose petition was allowed by the High Court and has since been reinstated to the service, the only allegation against the said lady judicial officer was of carrying on an illicit relationship with the appellant which the High Court found was without any basis or supporting material. According to him, in the present case, the High Court in the dated 25.10.2018 had clearly held that it was omitting the allegations of illicit relation with the lady judicial officer from consideration and further relied upon other allegations of misconduct or unsuitability against the appellant and therefore, the appellant cannot claim any advantage or benefit from the in the case of the lady judicial officer. 2 [2004] Supp. 4 SCR 368 : (2004) 11 SCC 743 3 [2005] Supp. 1 SCR 580 : (2005) 5 SCC 569 4 [2006] Supp. 9 SCR 208 : (2006) 12 SCC 418 5 [1978] 2 SCR 513 : (1978) 1 SCC 202 6 [1968] 3 SCR 234 : (1968) 3 SCR 234 7 (1997) 10 SCC 409 148 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 19. Having considered the submissions advanced, at the outset, we make it clear that we are not entering into the merits of the matter i.e., the reconsideration by the High Court in the Full Court meeting held on 03.08.2023 and the termination letter issued by the State on 02.04.2024. These s could be tested before the High Court by way of a fresh writ petition to be filed by the appellant and such liberty having been granted by this Court in the writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India filed by the appellant which was withdrawn on 22.09.2023. For the above reason, the case laws relied upon by Mr. Gupta are not being dealt with nor are we dealing with the case laws relied upon by Mr. Patwalia.
