Active measures are required at the Governmental level to ensure that such ideas are implemented/replicated in other parts of the country to promote sustainable development and gender equality. The Central and State Governments should support these models by providing financial assistance, creating enabling policies, and offering technical guidance to communities. (iii) As highlighted by the learned Amicus Curiae, sacred groves in different States are managed in various ways. Some are overseen by village panchayats or local bodies created for this purpose, while others rely solely on community traditions without any formal governance. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) is recommended to create a comprehensive policy for the governance and management of sacred groves across the country. As part of this policy, the MoEFCC must also develop a plan for a nationwide survey of sacred groves, by whatever name they are identified in each State. This survey should identify their area, location, and extent, and clearly mark their boundaries. These boundaries 1874 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports should remain flexible to accommodate the natural growth and expansion of these forests while ensuring strict protection against any reduction in size due to agricultural activities, human habitation, deforestation, or other causes. (iv) It must be noted that the National Forest Policy, 1988, carries a statutory flavour as noted in Para 72 of the T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad(87) v. Union of India,19 Clause 4.3.4.2 of the National Forest Policy, 1988, highlights the importance of encouraging people with customary rights in forests to help protect and improve forest ecosystems, as they depend on these forests for their needs. Therefore, it is suggested that MoEFCC should strive to create policies and programs that protect the rights of these communities and involve them in forest conservation. IX. CONCLUSION 59.
