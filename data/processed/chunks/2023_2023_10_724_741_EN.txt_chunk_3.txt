The Review Petitioner who was holding the office of Director in DMC tendered his resignation on 31.03.2009. On 22.06.2009, Respondent No. 1 issued a demand for Arbitration to the Review Petitioner under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA. The statement of claim was also against DMC and GBTL seeking G damages to the tune of US $ 4.8 million. 3.6. GBTL filed its objections on 21.07.2009 to the effect that the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction to include it as a party in the arbitration as it was not a party to the agreement. On the same day, the Review Petitioner also filed a ‘without prejudice response’ H ARUN DEV UPADHYAYA v. INTEGRATED SALES SERVICE 729 LTD. & ANR. [VIKRAM NATH, J.] to the Statement of Claim stating, inter alia that he was not A signatory in the agreement between DMC and Respondent No. 1; secondly, that he never consented to or agreed to be bound by any arbitration agreement; and thirdly, any demand for arbitration against him in his individual capacity was not acceptable and was denied. B 3.7. The signatory to the Representation Agreement i.e. DMC filed its reply on 21.07.2009 to the Statement of Claim made by Respondent No.1. 3.8. In October, 2009, GBTL filed Special Civil Suit No. 1035 of 2009 before the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Nagpur, against C Respondent No. 1 seeking declaration and perpetual injunction and also for recovery of damages of Rs. 10,00,000/-. This suit is still pending. An application under 39 Rules 1&2 CPC was also filed in the said suit praying to restrain Respondent No. 1 to proceed with the arbitration on the ground that it could not be D compelled to participate in the arbitration as it was not a signatory to the agreement. 3.9. The Tribunal on 23.12.2009 passed an interlocutory holding that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to decide whether the non-signatory to the Representation Agreement were appropriately E named in the arbitration or not; the issue of piercing of the corporate veil and joinder of non-signatory parties could be decided after evidence is received and is not a preliminary issue; the claims of the Review Petitioner and GBTL would not be jeopardized and would not constitute a waiver of their rights of claims as non- signatory parties; that they must contest the arguments and factual F claims made by Respondent No.1; their non-participation in the arbitration would potentially expose them to an adverse award or an award by default.
