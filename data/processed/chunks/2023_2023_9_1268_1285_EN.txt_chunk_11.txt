The amended provision has excepted international commercial arbitrations from the mandate of the twelve-month timeline which governs C domestic arbitrations. The amendment is intended to meet the criticism over the timeline in its application to international commercial arbitrations. The amendment is remedial in that it carves out international commercial arbitrations from the rigour of the timeline of six months. This lies within the domain of the arbitrator and is outside the purview of judicial D intervention. The removal of the mandatory time limit for making an arbitral award in the case of an international commercial arbitration does not confer any rights or liabilities on any party. Since Section 29A(1), as amended, is remedial in nature, it should be applicable to all pending arbitral proceedings as on the effective date i.e., 30 August 2019. E 35. We may notice certain s of the High Courts on the provisions of Section 29A which have been adverted to during the course of oral submissions. Those decisions are: i. A decision of a Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi dated 23 January 2020 in Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. Pvt. Ltd. Vs Jindal India Thermal Power Ltd.;15 F ii. A decision of a Single Judge of the Delhi High Court dated 21 July 2020 in ONGC Petro Additions Ltd. vs Ferns Construction Co. Inc.;16 and iii. The decision of the Chief Justice of the High Court of G Judicature for Orissa at Cuttack dated 11 December 2020 in M/s SARA International Pvt. Ltd. Vs Southern Eastern Railways & Anr.17 14 Hitendra Vishnu Thakur v. State of Maharashtra, (1994) 4 SCC 602 15 OMP (Misc) (Comm.) No 512/2019 16 OMP (Misc) (Comm) 256/2019 H 17 ARBP No. 28 of 2020 TATA SONS PVT LTD (FORMERLY TATA SONS LTD) v. SIVA INDUSTRIES 1285 AND HOLDINGS LTD [DR. DHANAJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 36. In Shapoorji Pallonji, the Delhi High Court had held that A amended Section 29A(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, being procedural law, would apply to the pending arbitrations as on the date of the amendment. However, a coordinate bench in MBL Infrastructures Ltd v. Rites Ltd.18 held that the amended Section 29A would be prospective in nature, without referring to the earlier in Shapoorji B Pallonji. Finally, the Delhi High Court in ONGC Petro Additions settled the controversy and reiterated the position of law as laid down in Shapoorji Pallonji. The Court, inter alia, stated that Section 29A(1) shall be applicable to all pending arbitrations seated in India as on August 30, 2019 and commenced after October 23, 2015, and there is no strict time line prescribed to the proceedings which are in nature of international C commercial arbitration as defined under the Act, seated in India. 37. Consistent with the amended provisions of Section 29A, the sole arbitrator in the present case would be acting within his domain and jurisdiction to decide upon any further extension of time beyond what is originally stipulated at the meeting which was held on 21 March 2018.
