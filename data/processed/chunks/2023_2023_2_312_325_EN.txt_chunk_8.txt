2017, H pg. 31) NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY LTD. v. THE CHIEF 323 ELECTORAL OFFICER & ORS. [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] be given paramount importance and it is not open for the Court to add, A delete or substitute any words (Suraj Mal Ram Niwas Oil Mills (P) Ltd. vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd9.). Insurance contracts are in the nature where exceptions cannot be made on ground of equity and the Courts ought not to interfere with the terms of an insurance agreement (Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Limited vs. Garg B Sons International10). 29. This Court in Vikram Greentech India Ltd. v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd.11reiterated that the insured cannot claim anything more than what is covered by the insurance policy. The terms of the contract have to be construed strictly, without altering the nature of the C contract as the same may affect the interests of the parties adversely. The clauses of an insurance policy have to be read as they are. Consequently, the terms of the insurance policy, that fix the responsibility of the insurance company must also be read strictly. 30. In several other judgements12, this court has held that the D insurance contract must be read as a whole and every attempt should be made to harmonise the terms thereof, keeping in mind that the rule of contra proferentem does not apply in case of commercial contract, for the reason that a clause in a commercial contract is bilateral and has mutually been agreed upon. 31. Now we turn to the specific clause in the MoU, which would E govern the insurance policy providing for payment of compensation in the event of death (only) resulting “solely and directly” from the accident caused by external violent and any other visible means. On a plain reading itself, leave aside the question of strict interpretation of the clauses, it is quite apparent that the admissibility of the claim is in the event of death. F The second part of the same sentence begins with “only”. Thus, even in the event of a death, it is only in the scenario where the consequent situation arises, i.e., it has to be solely and directly from an accident caused by external violence. Here the death is by sun stroke. There was no semblance of any violence being the cause of death.
