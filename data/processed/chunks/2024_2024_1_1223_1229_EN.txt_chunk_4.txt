Accordingly, in our view the Appellant cannot be unfairly deprived of the benefit of female reservation merely on account of the Appellant’s honesty and restraint which did not allow her to mark ‘yes’ against a column inquiring about a prospective candidates’ status as a person belonging to the NCL, in the absence of the underlying supporting document. Additionally, other similarly situated candidates have been granted the benefit under the Corrigendum; and their otherwise defective applications have now been considered by the Respondent. 18. In our considered opinion, the High Court adopted a hyper-technical interpretation of the Instructions without appreciating that such an interpretation would nullify the effect of the Corrigendum. Such an interpretation ought not to have been adopted especially in light of the fact that other persons have been granted the benefit of the Corrigendum; and that the Respondent has relaxed the Instructions qua such persons so as to enable valid NCL Certificates to be furnished. 19. In light of the aforesaid, we find that the Impugned and resultantly, the Underlying ought to be set aside. Accordingly, taking note of the peculiar facts of the case; and that the Appellant is a meritorious candidate who has cleared the main examination under the ‘Open General Category’ despite being deserving of the benefit of female reservation, we are inclined to balance the equities and do justice by exercising our power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, we direct the Respondent to forthwith treat the Appellant as a candidate under the ‘Reserved Female Category’. 20. The appeal is allowed in the aforesaid terms. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan Result of the case: Appeal allowed.
