In other words, whether the revision of freight charges was done pursuant to a new methodology being adopted or due to an error in the existing notified freight charges? (i) It is submitted that the freight charges/ the distance between BAD station to HSR station was revised / corrected by the Petitioner vide its notification dt.05.07.2005 (Annexure P-3 @Pg.146 of the SLP). The said revision/ correction was carried out after ‘critically reviewing’ the old distance tables with the revised distance tables of the North Central Railways (NCR). It is clearly stated in the said notification that the earlier notified distance of 444 km was used for calculating the freight as the revised distance table of NCR, despite being available, was not received earlier. This clearly shows lapses on part of the Petitioner. Despite being aware that the revised distance tables had come for the NCR, the same were not considered and the Petitioner continued calculating the freight as per the old distance, which is illegal. (ii) It is further submitted that there is no change in the tracks or route from BAD to HSR. It appears that the wrong distance was notified in the old table, that is why there was a need to critically review the same before notifying the corrected distance. 4. It is pertinent to mention here that the Petitioner has made a subtle attempt to mislead this Hon’ble Court by introducing circulars dt.07.04.2004 & 24.09.2004 in its SLP. The Petitioner has used the said circulars to erroneously allege that the change of distance was to be applied prospectively from date mentioned in the said circulars. In this regard it is submitted that the said circulars do not pertain to change of distance. The said circulars stipulate the guidelines for rounding off the chargeable distance upto two decimal places. Even the file no. of the said circulars is completely [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1079 Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. different from the notification issued on 05.07.2005, whereby the corrected rates were notified between BAD & HSR. The file no. of the circulars dt. 07.04.2004 & 24.09.2004 is TCR/2043/2000/2, whereas, for the notification dt.05.07.2005, it is DRM/CLAOG RAD/ Distance Table/2004/20. It is submitted that this fact in itself makes it clear that the subject matter of the circulars dt. 07.04.2004 & 24.09.2004 and notification dt.05.07.2005 are totally distinct and separate and the said circulars have no bearing upon the present case. 5. It is also pertinent to mention here that there is an unexplained delay of 661 days in filing the SLP by the Petitioner. In the light of the aforementioned submissions, it is humbly prayed that the present SLP filed by the Petitioner be dismissed.” F. ANALYSIS 21. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the following pivotal questions fall for our consideration: - I. What is the scope of Section 106 sub-section (3) of the Railways Act, 1989? In other words, what constitutes an “overcharge” within the meaning of Section 106 sub-section (3) of the Railways Act, 1989?
