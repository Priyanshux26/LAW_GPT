In R C Poudyal v. Union of India,3 the Court elucidated that although the term ‘secular’ was not present in the Constitution before its insertion in the Preamble by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, secularism essentially represents the nation’s commitment to treat persons of all faiths equally and without discrimination. In M Ismail Faruqui (Dr) v. Union of India,4 this Court elaborated that the expression secularism in the Indian context is a term of the widest possible scope. The State maintains no religion of its own, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience along with the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate their chosen religion, and all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs, enjoy equal freedoms and rights. However, the ‘secular’ nature of the State does not prevent the elimination of attitudes and practices derived from or connected with religion, when they, in the larger public interest impede development and the right to equality. In essence, the concept of secularism represents one of the facets of the right to equality, intricately woven into the basic fabric that depicts the constitutional scheme’s pattern. 5. Similarly, the word ‘socialism’, in the Indian context should not be interpreted as restricting the economic policies of an elected government of the people’s choice at a given time. Neither the 1 [1973] Supp. 1 SCR 1 : (1973) 4 SCC 225 (13 Judges) 2 [1994] 2 SCR 644 : (1994) 3 SCC 1 (9 Judges) 3 [1993] 1 SCR 891 : (1994) Supp. 1 SCC 324 4 [1994] Supp. 5 SCR 1 : (1994) 6 SCC 360 952 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Constitution nor the Preamble mandates a specific economic policy or structure, whether left or right. Rather, ‘socialist’ denotes the State’s commitment to be a welfare State and its commitment to ensuring equality of opportunity. India has consistently embraced a mixed economy model, where the private sector has flourished, expanded, and grown over the years, contributing significantly to the upliftment of marginalized and underprivileged sections in different ways. In the Indian framework, socialism embodies the principle of economic and social justice, wherein the State ensures that no citizen is disadvantaged due to economic or social circumstances. The word ‘socialism’ reflects the goal of economic and social upliftment and does not restrict private entrepreneurship and the right to business and trade, a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g). 6. The argument that the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, should be struck down due to its enactment during the Emergency and the extended period of the Lok Sabha was previously deliberated in Parliament, during the consideration of the Constitution Forty-Fifth Amendment Bill, 1978. During these deliberations, the inclusion of the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ came under scrutiny. Subsequently, this Bill was renumbered and called the Constitution Forty-Fourth Amendment Act 1978. The word ‘secular’ was explained as denoting a republic that upholds equal respect for all religions, while ‘socialist’ was characterized as representing a republic dedicated to eliminating all forms of exploitation—whether social, political, or economic.
