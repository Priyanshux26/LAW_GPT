[Para 6.5][339- F-H; 340-A-C] 2. To interpret Regulation 40(1) of the Regulations in the manner in which the appellants have understood and/or D interpretated would lead to arbitrariness and denying a government servant the benefit of annual increment which he has already earned while rendering specified period of service with good conduct and efficiently in the last preceding year. It would be punishing a person for no fault of him. As observed E hereinabove, the increment can be withheld only by way of punishment or he has not performed the duty efficiently. Any interpretation arbitrariness which and/or would lead to unreasonableness should be avoided. If the interpretation as suggested on behalf of the appellants and the view taken by the F Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court is accepted, in that case it would tantamount to denying a government servant the annual increment which he has earned for the services he has rendered over a year subject to his good behaviour. The entitlement to receive increment therefore crystallises when the government servant completes requisite length of service with G good conduct and becomes payable on the succeeding day. In the present case the word “accrue” should be understood liberally and would mean payable on the succeeding day. Any contrary view would lead to arbitrariness and unreasonableness and denying a government servant legitimate one annual increment H 334 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A though he is entitled to for rendering the services over a year with good behaviour and efficiently and therefore, such a narrow interpretation should be avoided. [Para 6.7][343-A-E] P.
