It was, thereafter, that the G Mussalman Waqf Act, 1923 was enacted. Thereunder, by virtue of Section 2(e), waqf-alal-aulad was excluded from the operation of the 1923 Act. Still further in the year 1930, the Mussalman Waqf Validating Act, 1930 was enacted, which declared only that the 1913 Act applied to Waqfs created before the commencement of the 1913 Act. It is thereafter H 954 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A that the U.P. Muslim Waqfs Act, 1936 (hereinafter referred to as, ‘the 1936 Act’) and the 1960 Act were enacted. Neither the 1936 nor the 1960 Acts applied to the facts. Therefore, it is contended that the appellant cannot have a case that the alleged Waqf was registered either under the 1936 Act or the 1960 Act. The object of the Waqf relied upon is to benefit the offspring and their offspring and in their absence to the Shia B poor. The 1936 Act did not apply and Waqf could not have been registered under the 1936 Act. There is no religious or charitable purpose to the Waqf Deed dated 26.07.1934. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in Fazlul Rabbi Pradhan v. State of West Bengal and others10. The waqf not being registered, the summary procedure under the Act C was not applicable. It is further complained that the appellants have different versions in regard to the alleged registration. On the one hand, it is contended that registration was actually done in 1934, at which time, the 1923 Act was in force. The said Act, apart from specifically excluding waqf-alal-aulad from its ambit did not provide for any provisions relating to registration. It is further pointed out that during the hearing, a case is D set up that registration was done under the 1936 Act. In view of the specific exclusion, by way of Section 2(2)(i), it does not apply as the entire income was going for the benefit of the members of the family. There is a procedure at any rate prescribed under the 1936 Act, in Section 38. The same has not been followed. The third version, it is pointed out, E was that the waqf was registered under the 1960 Act. A Report of the Controller, which was for the first time relied upon in this Court and which was disbelieved by the Tribunal, cannot be the basis. Still further, as the entire income was dedicated to the descendants of the waqif stood excluded from the ambit of the 1960 Act, the claim was without basis. Here again, Section 29 provided the procedure for registration. F The same, having not been conformed with, it could not be said that the waqf was registered under the 1960 Act. In view of the 1960 Act not being applicable, the bar to the compromise of the suit or proceeding relating to waqfs, enacted in Section 69, was inapplicable. The summary procedure for recovery of Waqf Properties mentioned in Section 45B G was not available. No reliance could be placed on the extract of the Register of the Waqf purporting to establish the registration of the waqf and which was produced by Respondent No.4-Collector for the first time in Rejoinder submissions before this Court.
