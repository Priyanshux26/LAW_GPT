It is further alleged that on the plea of PW-1, the appellant (AO1) booked a case against one M. Ashok, a worker in the saw-mill and not against PW-1 and thereafter, a compounding fee of Rs.50,000/- was charged, by issuing a receipt (Exhibit P-2) in the name of M. Ashok. 5. It is further alleged that after their visit on 6th January, 2023, the appellant (AO1) and AO2 started demanding mamool (monthly gratification) to the tune of Rs.5,000/- from the PW-1 under a threat that they would book a case against him and in that manner his business would be ruined. Threatening calls were allegedly made to PW-1 on a regular basis. On 21st January, 2003, AO2 called PW-1 and asked him to keep the mamool money ready with further instruction that he would make a call and give directions for delivery of the said bribe. On 22nd January, 2003, the appellant (AO1) called PW-1 and asked him to reach Hotel Quality-Inn Residency, Nampally (hereinafter being referred to as ‘Hotel Quality-Inn’), on early morning of 23rd January, 2003 with the demanded mamool amount of Rs. 5,000/-. Disinclined to pay the bribe, PW-1 lodged a complaint (Exhibit P-1) on 22nd January, 2003 with Shri G. Ramachander, Deputy Superintendent of Police, ACB (hereinafter being referred to as ‘DySP’)(PW-10) and a crime report was registered thereupon. The trap was arranged on 23rd January, 2003. The complainant (PW-1), along with his friend Potagunta Ramesh Naidu (hereinafter being referred to as ‘PW-2’) reached the ACB office with the currency notes to the tune of Rs.5,000/- being the bribe amount. Two independent witnesses, namely, Kathi Srinivas Rao (PW-3) and Md. Mahmood Ali were summoned to act 644 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports as mediators (panchas). At 9:45 am, the trap party conducted the pre- trap proceedings which were recorded in the memorandum (Exhibit P-4). After completing the pre-trap proceedings, the trap party, under the leadership of DySP (PW-10) proceeded to the Hotel Quality-Inn at 10:30 am. The complainant (PW-1) and PW-2 entered the Hotel and met the appellant (AO1) in the coffee shop of the said Hotel. It is further alleged that the complainant (PW-1) offered the bribe amount to the appellant (AO1) at the coffee shop, who showed reluctance to accept the same and asked them to follow him into the cellar of the hotel. The DySP and the other trap party members followed them from a distance. After reaching the cellar, the appellant (AO1) demanded and accepted the bribe amount from the complainant (PW-1) and pushed it down into the rexine bag which he was carrying. The prosecution claims that the above sequence of events which transpired between the appellant (AO1) and the complainant (PW-1) in presence of PW-2 was also visible to the trap party which was waiting in the hotel lobby, however, they could not overhear the conversation. 6. At about 11:25 am, PW-2 came out of the cellar and gave the pre- arranged signal upon which, the trap party proceeded towards the appellant (AO1).
