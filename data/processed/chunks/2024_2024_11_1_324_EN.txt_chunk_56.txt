77 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. Gujarat under Section 15 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 (MMRD Act) specifying rates of royalty and dead rent to be paid by mining companies. Section 15(3) of the MMRD Act prohibited the state government from increasing the rates of royalty (and as a result dead rent)61 more than once in a period of four years. For the four-year period between 1974 and 1978, this Court found that the State of Gujarat had increased the rates of royalty and dead rent in 1974 and then again impermissibly increased royalty rates in 1975 and dead rents in 1976. The Court struck down these subsequent enhancements as violative of Section 15(3) of the MMRD Act.62 A question then arose, as to whether after invalidating these subsequent notifications, the rate of royalty and dead rent under the last valid notification of 1974 stood revived or not. Justice DP Madon, writing for the Bench, cited the decision in Central Provinces Manganese Ore with approval and held: “72. The position before us is the same. It was not the intention of the Government of Gujarat that even if the new schedule of royalty substituted by the 1975 Notification was void and inoperative Schedule I as substituted by the 1974 Notification nonetheless stand repealed. It was equally not the intention of the Government of Gujarat that even if the rates of dead rent substituted in Schedule II by the 1976 Notification were void and inoperative, the rates of dead rent as substituted by the 1974 Notification would nonetheless stand repealed. If the contention in this behalf were correct, it would lead to the startling result that on and from the date of the coming into force of the 1975 Notification no royalty was payable in respect of minor minerals and that on and from the date of the coming into force of the 1976 Notification no dead rent was payable in respect of any leased area. The rates in Schedule I and Schedule II were intended to be substituted by new rates. The intention was not to repeal them in any event. If the substitutions effected by the 1975 and 1976 Notifications were invalid, such substitutions were equally invalid to repeal the 1974 61 See Ibid [55] (Madon J). 62 Ibid [65], [67] (Madon J). 78 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Notification. The result is that the 1974 Notification continued to be operative both as regards the rates of royalty and the rates of dead rent until they were validly substituted with effect from April 1, 1979, by the 1979 Notification.” (emphasis supplied) The above extract comports with the reasoning in Central Provinces Manganese Ore. The two-Judge bench observed that it could never have been the intention of the Government of Gujarat to independently repeal the existing 1974 rates of royalty and dead rent when it substituted them by subsequent notifications enhancing the rates. This is doubly evident from the fact that the government had enhanced the rates of royalty and dead rent.
