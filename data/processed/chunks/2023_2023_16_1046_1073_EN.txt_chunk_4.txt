This included condition qua pendency/contemplation of disciplinary proceedings. Therefore, the subsequent clarifi cation6 brought out by the Government through its letter dated 09.07.2018 amounts to nothing but changing the rules of the game. It is further contended that at the previous stages of the litigation, that is before the Single Judge and Division Bench, it was never the pleaded stance of the State that the date of consideration was 31.08.2019. In fact, there it was contended that 01.11.2018 was the cut-off date qua all eligible conditions. 6 It was clarifi ed therein that 01.11.2018 was the cut-off date in to determine the age-related criterion while other conditions of eligibility was to be tested as on date of consideration. 105 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 14.

On a reading of Rule 9, letter dated 30.05.2019 and letter dated 09.07.2019, whether 01.11.2018 can be said to be the cut-off period uniformly applicable qua all the eligibility conditions provided in Rule 9(1)(a) and (b) or is such date to be considered as the cut-off date only for the purpose of determining age-related eligibility? 2. If we are to hold that 01.11.2018 was the cut off only for the limited purpose, whether Dinesh Singh satisfi ed the other eligibility conditions?
