Discrepancies galore in the prosecution’s case tear asunder the fabric of its purported version as to how events unfolded. Oftentimes, Courts fi nd that reckless overzealousness and unbridled fervour coupled with scant regard for due procedures and practices on the part of the police, in picking upon those whom they perceive to be the guilty party and then building up a case against them, accomplishes the direct opposite of what they seek to achieve, by exposing gaping holes and weak links in the chain of evidence that they ultimately off er, as is the situation now. 16. To begin with, there is no clarity as to the time at which Ajit Pal went missing. Ex. P1, being the ‘missing person’ report lodged by Rajwant Kaur (PW-1), recorded that Ajit Pal left the house on 26.03.2013 6 1989 Supp (2) SCC 706 12 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. at 9 o’clock and went somewhere and that he was searched for but was not found. Signifi cantly, there is no mention therein of whether it was at 9 am or 9 pm that Ajit Pal had left the house or that it was to see the ‘Holika’. PW-6 is the Chief Constable at Gorakhpur Police Station who recorded Ex. P1 on 27.03.2013. He stated that PW-1 reported that her son, Ajit Pal, had left the house on 26.03.2013 at 9 o’clock without telling anyone and he had not been found despite their search. There is a mention of the time as 9 o’clock, without specifying whether it was in the morning or night and again, no mention of the ‘Holika’. However, FIR No.273/13 (Ex. P35), registered on 28.03.2013 at 18:20 hours, recorded that Ajit Pal had left the house on 26.03.2013 at ‘9 in the morning’ without telling anyone and that he was searched for everywhere but was not found. Again, there is no mention therein of his having gone to see the Holika, but there is now clear ambiguity whether Ajit Pal went missing on 26.03.2013 at 9 o’clock in the morning itself or at 9 o’clock at night. Further, the prosecution would have it that the kidnappers were not even certain as to the ransom amount that they wanted. Several varying fi gures fi nd mention in the prosecution’s case. If the very motive for the off ence was to collect ransom, it is doubtful whether the kidnappers would have been so equivocal about their demand. 17. Adding to the confusion, Rajwant Kaur (PW-1) stated during her cross-examination that the person on the phone who made the ransom call was a stranger and then went on to add that she had recognised the voicebut as her child’s life was in danger, she did not tell the police. She further stated that she did not say that she had recognized the voice until the end. She also admitted that she did not even mention in her examination-in-chief that she had recognised the voice. Compounding matters further, she stated that the police had used tracking dogs on 29.03.2013 but denied the suggestion that the dogs had detected the body in the well.
