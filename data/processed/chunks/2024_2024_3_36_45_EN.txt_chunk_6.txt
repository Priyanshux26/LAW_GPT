The statement of the victim would therefore reveal that the motive attributed by the deceased is to accused No. 1 Pappi @ Mashkoor. She stated that she had a quarrel with her devar Pappi @ Mashkoor over partition of the house. It can further be seen that the role of pouring kerosene on the victim and setting her ablaze is also attributed to accused No. 1 Pappi @ Mashkoor. 15. Insofar as other two accused i.e. Naeema (wife of accused No.1 Pappi @ Mashkoor) and her brother Naeem are concerned, the statement of the victim only states that they aided her devar Pappi @ Mashkoor. However, no specific role of how they assisted accused No. 1 Pappi @ Mashkoor could be found in the dying declaration (Ext. Ka-6). We therefore find that, though the said dying declaration can be the sole basis of maintaining the conviction of accused No. 1 Pappi @ Mashkoor, in the absence of any specific role attributed to accused No. 2 Naeema and accused No. 3 Naeem, they are entitled to the benefit of doubt.
