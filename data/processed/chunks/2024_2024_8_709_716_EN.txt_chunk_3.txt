Prior to that Junior Engineers were being appointed by upgrading different posts. 5.1 There is no dispute that the private contesting respondents herein were not Junior Engineers as on the date when the direct recruitments were made. The private contesting respondents were promoted on an officiating basis as Sectional Officers, Grade-I, on different dates. The Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) was held on 16.03.2007 to consider regularization of their officiating promotion. Officiating promotion of Sectional Officers, Grade-I, in the pay-scale of ₹4500-7000 was regularized vide Office dated 31.03.2007. Even if they had been working as Sectional Officer, Grade-I, from any 2 [2006] Supp. 10 SCR 1 : (2007) 1 SCC 683 : 2006 INSC 944 3 [2013] 13 SCR 540 : (2013) 8 SCC 693 : 2013 INSC 420 4 [2019] 11 SCR 444 : (2019) 16 SCC 28 : 2019 INSC 938 714 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports date prior to 16.03.2007, the same does not come to their rescue for the reason that they were working on a lower post. Sectional Officer, Grade-I, is a promotional post from Sectional Officer, Grade-II. 6. In response, Mr. Rana Mukherjee, learned senior counsel appearing for the contesting private respondents, who were the writ petitioners before the High Court in W.A.No.4 of 2020 submitted that Office dated 31.03.2007 clearly shows that the private contesting respondents were deemed to be promoted from various dates as Sectional Officers, Grade-I, as their officiating promotion was regularized. The dates as are available in the aforesaid Office in most of the cases was prior to the date of appointment of the appellants in C.A.@S.L.P. (C)No.17102 of 2021. Hence, they were rightly granted seniority from that date as it was that post which was subsequently upgraded to Junior Engineer. There is no error in the passed by the Division Bench of the High Court and both the appeals deserve to be dismissed. 7. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the relevant referred record. 8. The undisputed facts in the case fall in a very narrow compass. There are two sets of employees working as Junior Engineers. The appellants in C.A.@S.L.P. (C)No.17102 of 2021 are the incumbents who were selected by the Nagaland Public Service Commission and were appointed as Junior Engineers vide Notification 01.05.2003. The private contesting respondents who were the writ petitioners and appellants before the Division Bench of the High Court in W.A.No.4 of 2020 were working as Sectional Officer, Grade-I and the post on which they were working was upgraded to that of Junior Engineer (Class-II Gazetted), vide letter dated 11.10.2007. The pay-scales on which the Sectional Officer, Grade-I, were working was ₹4500-7000 whereas the pay-scales on which Junior Engineer (Class-II Gazetted), were working was ₹6000-9750. 9. As stated before us, the post of Junior Engineer was governed by the 1997 Rules in terms of which 90% recruitment is to be done by direct recruitment and 10% by way of promotion. As stated before us, prior to 2003 selection by the Nagaland Public Service Commission no direct recruitment was made.
