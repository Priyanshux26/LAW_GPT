Further, as noted in Vidya Drolia (supra), if this duty within the limited compass is not exercised, and the F Court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may undermine the effectiveness of both, arbitration and the Court32. Therefore, this 24Vidya Drolia supra note 7, para 154.4. 25Nortel Networks supra note 22, para 45.1.

H 864 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A Court or a High Court, as the case may be, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 11(6) of the Act, is not expected to act mechanically merely to deliver a purported dispute raised by an applicant at the doors of the chosen arbitrator33, as explained in DLF Home Developers Limited v. Rajapura Homes Pvt. Ltd. B 29. Analysis: We will now proceed to apply these principles to the present case and examine the arbitrability of the dispute by undertaking a prima facie review of the basic facts. 30. SPML duly completed the stipulated work under the subject contract, and a Completion Certificate was issued by NTPC on C 27.03.2019. SPML sought the release of the final payment, and NTPC, by its letter dated 10.04.2019, agreed to release the same. 31. A No-Demand Certificate was issued by SPML on 12.04.2019, and the final payment was released by April 2019. There is nothing on record about any pending claims of SPML during the subsistence of the contract or till the release of the final payment. This is evident from the D Writ Petition as well as the Arbitration Petition under Section 11 of the Act. 32. While NTPC released the final payment, on 14.05.2019, it justified the withholding of SPML’s Bank Guarantees on the ground that there are certain disputes between the parties with respect to other E projects. 33. Objecting to the stand of NTPC by its letter dated 15.05.2019, SPML stated that linking the Bank Guarantees with claims under other projects was unjustified. In turn, SPML raised a claim of Rs. 72,01,53,899/ - against NTPC. At the same time, SPML also sought the appointment F of an “Adjudicator” to settle these claims. 34. It is in the above-referred context that SPML filed the Writ Petition before the High Court on 03.07.2019. The prayer in the Writ Petition, particularly in the context of the huge claim raised on 15.05.2019, assumes importance. The prayer is reproduced herein below for ready G reference: “(a) Pass an appropriate Writ, or Direction quashing the e-mail dated 14.05.2019 issued by the Respondent insofar 33DLF Home Developers Limited v.
