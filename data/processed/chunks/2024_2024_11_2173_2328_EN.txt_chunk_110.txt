The following principles can be culled out from the s: I. In HRD v. GAIL (supra), this Court held that a broad commonsensical approach must be adopted while interpreting 79 ibid, paras 37-38. 80 (2023) 8 SCC 226. 81 (2024) 4 SCC 341, see paras 85-91. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2317 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company the entries of the Schedules, such that they are not unduly enlarged or restricted.82 It rejected the submission that an expansive view must be taken to remove even the remotest likelihood of bias since the grounds for challenge of an award have been narrowed after the 2015 Amendment.83 Rather, it held that since the entries in these Schedules are based on the Red and Orange Lists of the IBA Guidelines, they must be interpreted as per the principles contained in these Guidelines. The standard to be adopted is that a reasonable third person who has knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that there is a likelihood of the arbitrator being influenced by factors other than the merits of the dispute.84 II. In Jaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh v. Ajay Sales & Suppliers85 and in Ellora Paper Mills v. State of M.P.,86 this Court has held that the purpose of Section 12(5) and the Seventh Schedule is to ensure the neutrality, independence, and impartiality of the arbitral tribunal.87 Further, in Jaipur Zila (supra), the Court held that the Seventh Schedule must be read as a whole, considering its object and purpose.88 III. This Court in Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (supra) rejected a challenge to the arbitrator’s eligibility under Section 12(5) on a ground that is not enumerated in the Seventh Schedule. Once the Parliament has devised a statutory scheme prescribing the de jure ineligibility of certain persons to act as an arbitrator, the Court must not deviate and add to these grounds, as it would create uncertainty in the arbitration process.89 40. After reviewing prior precedents and in view of what I have held about party autonomy, it can be said that the 2015 Amendment to Section 12, specifically the insertion of Section 12(5) and the Seventh Schedule, incorporates the overarching public policy consideration 82 HRD v. GAIL (supra), para 20. 83 ibid. 84 ibid. 85 (2021) 17 SCC 248. 86 (2022) 3 SCC 1. 87 Jaipur Zila Dugdh (supra), para 14. 88 ibid, paras 16-17. 89 Chennai Metro Rail (supra), para 41. 2318 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports that binds the contracting parties to constitute an independent and an impartial arbitral tribunal as a credible and an effective substitute to ordinary courts and tribunals established to provide access to justice. In furtherance of this objective, the court will not be bound by the procedure for constitution of the arbitral tribunal in the arbitration agreement. I. International Perspective 41. Having noted the perspective of this Court on the duty of the parties to appoint an independent tribunal after the 2015 Amendment, and before concluding, it is necessary to examine the international perspective on the issue.
