Therefore, in our considered view the scope of the functions of the proper officer under the new Section 17 is limited. 91. It is evident from the aforesaid that the attention of this Court in Canon India (supra) was not drawn to the important changes brought to Section 17 of the Act, 1962 vide Section 38 of the Finance Act, 2011 with effect from 08.04.2011. 92. The observation in paragraph 13 in Canon India (supra) that “where one officer has exercised his powers of assessment, the power to reassessment must also be exercised by the same officer or his successor and not by another officer of another department though he is designated to be an officer of the same rank” has been made [2024] 12 S.C.R. 277 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. without taking note of the changes to Section 17 of the Act, 1962 with effect from 08.04.2011. 93. Similarly, the observation in paragraph 14 in Canon India (supra) is erroneous. The relevant paragraph is reproduced below: “We find it completely impermissible to allow an officer, who has not passed the original of assessment, to re-open the assessment on the grounds that the duty was not paid/not levied, by the original officer who had decided to clear the goods and who was competent and authorised to make the assessment. The nature of the power conferred by Section 28(4) to recover duties which have escaped assessment is in the nature of an administrative review of an act. The section must therefore be construed as conferring the power of such review on the same officer or his successor or any other officer who has been assigned the function of assessment.” In other words, the conclusion that an officer who did the assessment, could only undertake reassessment under Section 28(4) was arrived at without taking note of the abovementioned amendment to Section 17 of the Act, 1962 with effect from 08.04.2011 vide Section 38 of the Finance Act, 2011. The in Canon India (supra) also recorded an erroneous finding that the function of re-assessment is with reference to Section 28(4) when in fact it is an exercise of function under Section 17. 94. Further, in Canon India (supra) the subject show cause notice was dated 19.09.2014 in respect of the Bill of Entry filed on 20.03.2012. This Court appears to have erroneously applied the provisions of Section 17 of the Act, 1962, as they stood prior to 08.04.2011 as opposed to the amended Section 17 which ought to have been applied. iv. Scheme of Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 95. Section 17 read with Sections 46 and 47 of the Act, 1962 deals with the assessment and re-assessment at the first instance that is, upon entry of the consignments and clearance of bill(s) of entry. The amendment to Section 17 introduces the process of 278 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports self-assessment and subsequent re-assessment upon verification by the proper officer, if so required, for undertaking a check at the first instance.
