This Court issued a C direction in Paragraph 44.4 : “44.4 The State functionaries and private and public sector undertakings/organisations/bodies/ institutions, etc. shall put in place sufficient mechanism to ensure full implementation of Vishaka [Vishaka v. State of D Rajasthan, (1997) 6 SCC 241 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 932] guidelines and further provide that if the alleged harasser is found guilty, the complainant victim is not forced to work with/under such harasser and where appropriate and possible the alleged harasser should be transferred. Further provision should be made that harassment and E intimidation of witnesses and the complainants shall be met with severe disciplinary action.” (xii) In Githa Hariharan (Ms.) & Anr. vs. Reserve Bank of India & Anr.77, this Court was dealing with a challenge to Section 6(a) of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, F 1956 and Section 19(b) of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 which declared the father to be the natural guardian of the person and property of a minor son and unmarried daughter. The mother was recognised as the natural guardian under these provisions “after the father”. These provisions G resulted in hardship to spouses separated from each other while dealing with the wards. Reading the obligations of the State under certain International Conventions like CEDAW into the right to dignity of women and gender 76 (2013) 1 SCC 297 H 77 (1999) 2 SCC 228 KAUSHAL KISHOR v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS. 675 [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] equality, traceable to Article 21 and 14, this Court read down A the word “after” to mean “in the absence of”. By such interpretation, this Court invoked fundamental rights to interpret a word in the sphere of family law. (xiii) In Indian Medical Association vs. Union of India.78, the policy of an Army College of Medical Sciences to admit B only those who are wards of army personnel, based on scores obtained in an entrance test, was under challenge. The question that came up for consideration was whether this discriminatory practice by a private entity would be in violation of Article 15 of the Constitution. This Court in C Paragraph 187 stated: “187. Inasmuch as education, pursuant to T.M.A. Pai [(2002) 8 SCC 481], is an occupation under sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of Article 19, and it is a service that is offered for a fee that takes care of all the expenses of D the educational institution in rendering that service, plus a reasonable surplus, and is offered to all those amongst the general public, who are otherwise qualified, then such educational institutions would also be subject to the discipline of clause (2) of Article 15. In this regard, the purport of the above exposition of clause (2) of E Article 15, when read in the context of egalitarian jurisprudence inherent in Articles 14, 15, 16 and Article 38, and read with our national aspirations of establishing a society in which equality of status and opportunity, and justice, social, economic and F political, would imply that the private sector which offers such facilities ought not to be conducting their affairs in a manner which promote existing discriminations and disadvantages.” (xiv) In Society for Unaided Private Schools of Rajasthan G (supra), the constitutionality of Section 12 of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 was challenged on the ground that it violated Articles 19(1)(g) and 30 of those who had established schools in the private 78 (2011) 7 SCC 179 H 676 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R.
