Respondent has extensively argued that there is a clear convergence of interests of both the 1961 Act and 1987 Act and that the 2003 Policy exempts the recovery of the fees under both laws as incentives for the Development of Agro and Food Processing Industries. 15. Respondent further argued that the High Court had rightly dismissed the application for review of the dated 27.01.2010 by relying upon Note dated 28.08.2001 which was issued by the Punjab Rural Development Board, Chandigarh (recording therein the decision of the Chief Minister of Punjab) that exemption on an item from Market fees will automatically be extended to fees under the 1987 Act. Since the Respondent relied heavily on the Note dated 28.08.2001 before us as well as the High Court, it becomes pertinent for the State to duly counter such submission. 16. In this regard, the State submitted that the letters dated 28.08.2001, 09.10.2001, 10.09.2001 are clarified with the letters dated 02.11.2010 752 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and 21.02.2011 respectively. The Letter dated 02.11.2010 has been issued by the Department of Agriculture referring to the Govt. Memo dated 09.10.2001 and states that it has been found that the letter dated 09.10.2001 was not issued with the approval of the Competent Authority and is accordingly withdrawn. 17. Further, the Memo dated 21.02.2011 is another letter issued by the Department of Agriculture which also refers to the earlier memo dated 02.11.2010. The relevant parts of the latter memo are reproduced below: “… … …. …. … 4. It is clarified that because in the recovery of Rural Development Fee, the rules regarding recovery of Market Fee are applicable Mutatis Mutandis, therefore, the items which are directly exempted under certain conditions i.e: under rule 29 and 30, the same will be applicable in the recovery of Rural Development Fee, meaning that the exemption will be applicable on Rural Development Fee on the same items. 5. Besides, the exemption from Market fee under rules 30-C, is also granted by the State Govt. in exercise of the powers on case to case basis through a separate notification. Such cases are mainly covered under Industrial Policy 2003 or Guidelines for Mega projects 2007. Under these concessions, eligible units can be exempted from Market Fee or both from Market Fee and Rural Development Fee. In such cases, exemption from Market Fee will not be automatically applicable on Rural Development Fee, rather, the exemption from Rural Development Fee will applicable if the competent authority issues a specific / notification in this respect.” 18. However, the Respondent was quick to bring to our notice that the communication dated 02.11.2010 only withdraws the Memo dated 09.10.2001 and not the Note dated 28.08.2001. Further, it was also argued that the Appellant’s reliance on communication dated 21.02.2011 is wholly misconceived as that communication is subsequent to the petition of the Respondent being disposed of by the High Court.
