747 Bilkis Yakub Rasool v. Union of India & Others Held: of remission dated 10.08.2022 passed by the State of Gujarat in favour of 11 convicts is not in accordance with law – Government of the State of Gujarat had usurped the powers of the State of Maharashtra which only could have considered the applications seeking remission – Hence, the doctrine of usurpation of powers applies – State of Gujarat never sought for the review of the of this Court dated 13.05.2022 by bringing to the notice of this Court that it was contrary to s.432(7) and s of this Court – Policy of 1992 of the State of Gujarat was not applicable to the case of 11 convicts – Opinion of the Presiding Judge of the Court before which the conviction of 11 convicts was made- Special Court, Mumbai (Maharashtra) was rendered ineffective by the Government of the State of Gujarat which in any case had no jurisdiction to entertain the plea for remission of convicts – Opinion of the Sessions Judge at Dahod was wholly without jurisdiction as the same was in breach of s.432(2) – Furthermore, while considering the applications seeking remission, the Jail Advisory Committee, Dahod and the other authorities lost sight of the fact that 11 convicts had not yet paid the fine ed by the Special Court, Mumbai which had been upheld by the Bombay High Court. [Paras 50.4, 56] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 432(2) – Power to suspend or remit sentence – Application made to the appropriate Government for remission of a sentence – Requirement of the opinion of the Presiding Judge of the convicting court: Held: s. 432(2) states that when an application is made to the appropriate Government, inter alia, for remission of a sentence, the appropriate Government may require the Presiding Judge of the Court before or by which the conviction was had or confirmed, to state his opinion – The opinion must state as to, whether, the application should be granted or refused, together with his reasons for such opinion which must have bearing on the facts and circumstances of the case and be in tandem with the record of the trial or of such record thereof as exists; and also must forward with the statement of such opinion a certified copy of the record of the trial or of such record thereof as exists – Having regard to the requirements which the Presiding Judge must comply with while stating his opinion to the appropriate Government on an application for remission of sentence made by a convict, the expression “may” has to be interpreted as “shall” and as a mandatory requirement 748 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports u/s.432 – Furthermore, it cannot be left to the whims and fancies of the appropriate Government either to seek or not to seek the opinion of the Presiding Judge or the Court before which the conviction had taken place. [Paras 51, 52.2, 52.3] Sentence/sentencing – Imprisonment undergone in default of payment of fine – Nature of: Held: Sentence of imprisonment awarded to a person for committing an offence is distinct than the imprisonment ed to be undergone in default of payment of fine – Latter is not a substantive sentence for commission of the offence but is in the nature of penalty for default in payment of fine – On facts, while considering the applications for remission, the Jail Advisory Committee did not take into consideration whether the convicts had tendered the fine imposed by the Special Court and affirmed by the High Court as well as by this Court – Had the State of Gujarat considered the opinion from the Presiding Judge of the Court which had convicted, the accused, the aspect regarding non-payment of fine would have surfaced – In the absence of non-compliance with the direction to pay fine, there would be default sentence which would be in the nature of penalty – Question whether the default sentence or penalty had to be undergone by these respondents, was a crucial consideration at the time of recommending remission to the State Government by the Jail Advisory Committee – This aspect of the matter has also not been taken into consideration by the State Government while passing the impugned s of remission.
