Placing reliance on Vidya Drolia (supra), this Court gave the “Eye of the Needle” test to delineate the contours of the power of interference which the referral court may exercise under Section 11 of the Act, 1996. The first prong of 892 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the said test requires the court to examine the validity and existence of the arbitration agreement which includes an examination of the parties to the agreement and the privity of the applicant to the contract. The second prong of the test requires the court to, as a general rule, leave all questions of non-arbitrability to the arbitral tribunal and only as a demurrer reject the claims which are ex- facie and manifestly non-arbitrable. However, it was clarified that the standard of the aforesaid scrutiny is only prima facie, that is, unlike the pre-2015 position, the scrutiny does not entail elaborate appreciation of evidence and conduct of mini trials by the referral courts. The relevant observations made therein are reproduced hereinbelow: “24. Following the general rule and the principle laid down in Vidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549], this Court has consistently been holding that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred first authority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability. In Pravin Electricals (P) Ltd. v. Galaxy Infra & Engg. (P) Ltd. [Pravin Electricals (P) Ltd. v. Galaxy Infra & Engg. (P) Ltd. (2021) 5 SCC 671, paras 29, 30 : (2021) 3 SCC (Civ) 307], Sanjiv Prakash v. Seema Kukreja [Sanjiv Prakash v. Seema Kukreja (2021) 9 SCC 732 : (2021) 4 SCC (Civ) 597] and Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. NCC Ltd. [Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. NCC Ltd. (2023) 2 SCC 539 : (2023) 1 SCC (Civ) 88], the parties were referred to arbitration, as the prima facie review in each of these cases on the objection of non-arbitrability was found to be inconclusive. Following the exception to the general principle that the Court may not refer parties to arbitration when it is clear that the case is manifestly and ex facie non-arbitrable, in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd. [BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd. (2021) 5 SCC 738 : (2021) 3 SCC (Civ) 352] (hereinafter “Nortel Networks”) and Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B. Ramachandraiah & Sons [Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B. Ramachandraiah & Sons (2021) 5 SCC 705 : (2021) 3 SCC (Civ) 335], arbitration was refused as the claims of the parties were demonstrably time-barred. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 893 SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Krish Spinning Eye of the needle 25. The abovereferred precedents crystallise the position of law that the pre-referral jurisdiction of the Courts under Section 11(6) of the Act is very narrow and inheres two inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence and the validity of an arbitration agreement, which also includes an inquiry as to the parties to the agreement and the applicant’s privity to the said agreement.
