The clauses in the contract were binding on the H UNION OF INDIA & ORS. v. M/S. BHARAT ENTERPRISE 807 respondent. It cannot be departed from invoking the principle in A Central Inland Water Transport Corporation. It is not the case of the contractor that when the contract was entered into, it was in circumstances which attracted the principles laid down therein. If the clauses operate, the inevitable result is the arbitrator could not have traveled outside of the contractual prohibition and passed B an award allowing claims which were submitted after the submission of the final bill. [Paras 22, 23, 25 and 26][824-F-H; 825-A-B; 826-A-D] Central Inland Water Transport Corporation & Anr. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly AIR 1986 SC 1571 : [1986] 2 SCR C 278 – referred to. 1.4 While this Court cannot subscribe to the reasoning adopted by the High Court, it cannot also be lost sight of that the amounts in question are fairly meagre and the final bill remained unpaid for long period of time. It was apparently the long delay in D the payment of the final bill amount which led to the raising of the new claims. Perhaps, if the final bill itself was not kept pending for such a long time, the entire dispute may not have arisen at all. Having regard to all the facts and circumstances, while this Court is inclined to set aside the impugned , the interests of justice would require that the respondent is paid a lumpsum amount in E full and final satisfaction of all his claims. The impugned is set aside. However, the appellants will pay a sum of Rs.3 lakhs (Rupees Three Lakhs only) to the respondent which will be in full and final settlement of the claims of the respondent.
