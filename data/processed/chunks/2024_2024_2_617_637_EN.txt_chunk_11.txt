Moreover, he was informed that he would be relieved after office hours on 15-1-1993. The vinculum juris [[Ed. : vinculum (per OED): A bond of union, a tie. Usually figurative, and juris (per Black’s): Of Law; Of Right]], therefore, in our [2024] 2 S.C.R. 633 Dr. Mrs. Suman V. Jain v. Marwadi Sammelan through its Secretary and Others considered opinion, continued and the relationship of employer and employee did not come to an end on 4-1-1993. The relieving and payment of salary also make it abundantly clear that he was continued in service of the Company up to 15-1-1993. 27. In the affidavit-in-reply filed by the Company, it was stated that resignation of the appellant was accepted immediately, and he was to be relieved on 4-1-1993. It was because of the request of the appellant that he was continued up to 15-1-1993. In the affidavit-in- rejoinder, the appellant had stated that he reported for duty on 15-1-1993 and also worked on that day. At about 12.00 noon, a letter was issued to him stating therein that he would be relieved at the close of the day. A cheque of Rs 13,511 was paid to him at 17.30 hrs. The appellant had asserted that he had not received terminal benefits such as gratuity, provident fund, etc. It is thus proved that up to 15-1- 1993, the appellant remained in service. If it is so, in our opinion, as per settled law, the appellant could have withdrawn his resignation before that date. It is an admitted fact that a letter of withdrawal of resignation was submitted by the appellant on 8-1- 1993. It was, therefore, on the Company to give effect to the said letter. By not doing so, the Company has acted contrary to the law and against the decisions of this Court and hence, the action of the Company deserves to be quashed and set aside. The High Court, in our opinion, was in error in not granting relief to the appellant. Accordingly, the action of the Company as upheld by the High Court is hereby set aside. ” 24. In the above case, on submitting the resignation, appellant was relieved on 04.01.1993 granting leave from 05.01.1993 till 13.01.1993. The effective date of resignation was prospective, i.e., 15.01.1993. The appellant therein withdrew the resignation before the effective date on 08.01.1993. The Company refused to accept such withdrawal of resignation. In the said factual context, this Court set-aside such an action of refusal to accept the withdrawal of resignation and 634 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports explained the principle of “vinculum juris” holding that the relationship of employer and employee did not come to an end on the date of sending an intimation of withdrawal of resignation and it would continue till the actual date of acceptance. In the said case, after quashing the action of the company, this Court held that it would be unjust to deny assignment of further work to the employee by the employer and the employee was held entitled for salary and other consequential benefits.
