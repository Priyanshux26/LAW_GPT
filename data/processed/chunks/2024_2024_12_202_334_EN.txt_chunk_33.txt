Mr. Chittatosh Mookerjee refers me to Mukherjee, J. (as his Lordship then was), observed, Kania C.J. Fazl Ali, Patanjali Sastri and Mahajan, JJ. (as their Lordships then were) agreeing: “That a decision is erroneous in law is certainly no ground for ing review. If the Court has decided a point and decided it erroneously, the error could not be one apparent on the face of the record or even analogous to it “When, however, the Court disposes of a case without adverting to or applying its mind to a provision of law which gives it jurisdiction to act in a particular way that may amount to an error analogous to one apparent on the face of the record sufficient to bring the case within the purview of 47, rule 1 of the CPC.” [Emphasis supplied] 254 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 63. In Girdhari Lal Gupta v. D. H. Mehta reported in (1971) 3 SCC 189, this Court allowed the review on the ground that its attention was not given to a particular provision of the statute. The relevant observations read as follows: “15. The learned counsel for the respondent State urges that this is not a case fit for review because it is only a case of mistaken . But we are unable to agree with this submission because at the time of the arguments our attention was not drawn specifically to sub-section 23-C(2) and the light it throws on the interpretation of sub-section (1). 16. In the result the review petition is partly allowed and the of this Court in Criminal Appeal No. 211 of 1969 modified to the extent that the sentence of six months' rigorous imprisonment imposed on Girdharilal is set aside. The sentence of fine of Rs 2000 shall, however, stand.” [Emphasis supplied] 64. In M/s Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. v. Lt. Governor of Delhi reported in (1980) 2 SCC 167, the scope of the power of review was explained by this Court wherein it was held that: “8. It is well-settled that a party is not entitled to seek a review of a delivered by this Court merely for the purpose of a rehearing and a fresh decision of the case. The normal principle is that a pronounced by the Court is final, and departure from that principle is justified only when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character make it necessary to do so: Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan [AIR 1965 SC 845 : (1965) 1 SCR 933, 948 : (1965) 1 SCJ 377] . For instance, if the attention of the Court is not drawn to a material statutory provision during the original hearing, the Court will review its : G.L. Gupta v. D.N. Mehta [(1971) 3 SCC 189 : 1971 SCC (Cri) 279 : (1971) 3 SCR 748, 750] . The Court may also reopen its if a manifest wrong has been done and it is necessary to pass an to do full and effective justice: O.N.
