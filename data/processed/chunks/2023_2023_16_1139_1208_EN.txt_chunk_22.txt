10, 13 and 14 of List I of the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution of India] and Parliament, holds the exclusive power to legislate upon such conventions or treaties. (iii) Parliament can refuse to perform or give eff ect to such treaties. In such event, though such treaties bind the Union, vis a vis the other contracting state(s), leaving the Union in default. (iv) The application of such treaties is binding upon the Union. Yet, they “are not by their own force binding upon Indian nationals”. (v) Law making by Parliament in respect of such treaties is required if the treaty or agreement restricts or aff ects the rights of citizens or others or modifi es the law of India. (vi) If citizens’ rights or others’ rights are not unaff ected, or the laws of India are not modifi ed, no legislative measure is necessary to give eff ect to treaties. (vii) In the event of any ambiguity in the provision or law, which brings into force the treaty or obligation, the court is entitled to look into the international instrument, to clear the ambiguity or seek clarity. 45. The clearest enunciation of law, on Section 90 can be found in Union of India (UOI) & Ors. v Azadi Bachao Andolan & Ors28. Apart from noticing the decisions of various High Courts (i.e. Commissioner of Income Tax v. Visakhapatnam Port Trust29, Commissioner of Income Tax v. Davy Ashmore India Ltd.30, Leonhardt Andra Und Partner, Gmbh v. Commissioner 28 2003 (Supp4) SCR 222 29 [1983]144ITR146(AP) 30 [1991]190 ITR 626 (Cal) 117 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. of Income Tax31, Commissioner of Income Tax v. R.M. Muthaiah32 and Arabian Express Line Ltd. of United Kingdom & Ors. v. Union of India33) this court held as follows: “The provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of the Act are expressly made “subject to the provisions of this Act”, which would include Section 90 of the Act. As to what would happen in the event of a confl ict between the provision of the Income Tax Act and a notifi cation issued Under Section 90, is no longer res integra. ************** *************** 26. A survey of the aforesaid cases makes it clear that the judicial consensus in India has been that section 90 is specifi cally intended to enable and empower the Central Government to issue a notifi cation for implementation of the terms of a double taxation avoidance agreement. When that happens, the provisions of such an agreement, with respect to cases to which where they apply, would operate even if inconsistent with the provisions of the Income Tax Act. We approve of the reasoning in the decisions which we have noticed. If it was not the intention of the legislature to make a departure from the general principle of chargeability to tax under section 4 and the general principle of ascertainment of total income under section 5 of the Act, then there was no purpose in making those sections “subject to the provisions” of the Act”.
