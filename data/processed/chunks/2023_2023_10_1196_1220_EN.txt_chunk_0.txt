G Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.319 – Object and purpose – discussed. Dismissing the appeal, the Court HELD: 1. The Constitution Bench of this Court in Hardeep Singh, it is noted that an inquiry is contemplated as against a H 1196 YASHODHAN SINGH & ORS. v. THE STATE OF UTTAR 1197 PRADESH & ANR. person who has been discharged prior to the commencement of A the trial in terms of Section 227 Cr.P.C. as extracted above but on an inquiry, if it appears that there is evidence against such a discharged person, then power under Section 319 Cr.P.C. can be exercised against such a discharged person. This clearly would mean that when a person who is not discharged but is to be B summoned as per Section 319 Cr.P.C. on the basis of satisfaction derived by the court on the evidence on record, no inquiry or hearing is contemplated. This would clearly indicate that principle of natural justice and an opportunity of hearing a person summoned under 319 Cr.P.C. are not at all contemplated. Such a right of inquiry would accrue only to a person who is already C discharged in the very same proceeding prior to the commencement of the trial.
