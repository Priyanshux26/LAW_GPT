The respondent Nos.6, 7 and 8 are alleged to be the benami companies of the respondent No. 2-Pallav Sheth. 31. Respondent No. 2-Pallav Sheth is the debtor of FFSL which was a company notified under the provisions of the Act of 1992. 304 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Respondent No. 2-Pallav Sheth was notified under the Act of 1992 on 6th October, 2001 and thus, by virtue of Section 3(3) of the Act of 1992, all properties belonging to him stood automatically attached from the date of such notification. The appellants herein had borrowed the amounts in question from respondent Nos. 6, 7 and 8, way back in the years 1996-1997. By that date, there could not have existed any justifiable reason for the appellants herein to have entertained a belief that these were the benami companies of respondent No. 2-Pallav Sheth or that there was any breach of the provisions of the Act of 1992 by Pallav Sheth or the respondent companies. 32. Even if it is assumed for the sake of arguments that respondent Nos. 4 to 8 were the benami companies of respondent No. 2-Pallav Sheth, he not having been notified under the Act of 1992 by the time the amounts were borrowed, the appellants could not be expected to entertain any doubt regarding the operation of the Act of 1992 either against these companies or even against respondent No. 2-Pallav Sheth or that the companies were the benami companies of Pallav Sheth. 33. The foundation behind the assertion made by the Custodian that the appellants herein were garnishees of respondent No. 2- Pallav Sheth through respondent Nos. 6, 7 and 8 is based entirely on a communication dated 5th May, 1998 purportedly issued by the Income Tax Department. An affidavit was filed on behalf of the Department in the proceedings before the Special Court but in such affidavit, there is no reference whatsoever to the outstanding dues of respondent Nos. 6, 7 and 8 or that the appellants were its debtors. Furthermore, there is no reference whatsoever in this affidavit with regard to letter dated 5th May, 1998 which was annexed with the affidavit filed on behalf of the Custodian and was heavily relied upon by the Special Court. No witness from the Income Tax Department was examined in evidence before the Special Court in miscellaneous applications for recovery. 34. While initiating recoveries, the Custodian relied upon the provisions of Sections 3 and 9A of the Act of 1992 which are reproduced hereinbelow:- “3. Appointment and functions of Custodian. — (1) The Central Government may appoint one or more Custodians as it may deem fit for the purposes of this Act. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 305 Suman L. Shah v.
