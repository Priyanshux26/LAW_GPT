(vii). The application of doctrine of non est factum would not arise in view of the plaintiff admitting the execution of the Power of Attorney. (viii). The plaintiff cannot turn around and take a contrary stand after having received the sale proceeds and handing over possession to the defendants. (ix). The scope of the present appeal before this Court is very limited, and unless exceptional and special circumstances are shown to establish the perversity in the judgement of the High Court, no interference is called for. The appeal deserves to be dismissed. (x).

As the High Court proceeded to record a fi nding that there was neither any pleading nor any issue framed regarding the plea of non est factum, it would be appropriate to fi rst deal with the contents of the plaint. 16. It is specifi cally averred in paragraph No.6 of the plaint that only intention for executing the Power of Attorney in favour of defendant No.2 was for developing the property in question into smaller plots and to get necessary approvals for the same from the relevant authorities. In paragraph 10 of the plaint, it is clearly stated that the plaintiff s were illiterate and had no means to get the above exercise carried out and as the defendant No.2 was well versed in dealing with Government Authorities, he could have helped them in developing the plots. Further, it was specifi cally stated in paragraph 10 that after reading the documents in 1991, the plaintiff s realized that the defendant had two additional clauses incorporated authorizing him to sell, gift, settle the plots in question and also to execute wherever necessary transfer of Patta Deeds. This was never the intention. These two additional rights recorded in the Power of Attorney deed was never intended nor conveyed nor informed. It is also stated in the plaint that taking advantage of illiteracy and simplicity of the plaintiff s, such rights have been incorporated in the Power of Attorney. 6 2011 (7) SCC 493 7 2007 (9) SCC 660 8 2013 (15) SCC 27 9 2000 (1) SCC 451 10 2011 (10) SCC 420 11 1999 (2) SCC 635 358 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 17. A plea of non est factum can be taken by an executor or signatory of the deed to plead that the said document is invalid as its executor/signatory was mistaken about its character at the time of executing/signing it.
