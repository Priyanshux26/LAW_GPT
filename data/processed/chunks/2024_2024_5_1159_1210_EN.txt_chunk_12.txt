16. Counsel for the appellants prayed for allowing the civil appeals, while advancing the following arguments: On merger, res judicata, and prospective overruling: a) The doctrine of merger is neither a doctrine of constitutional law nor a doctrine having statutory recognition. It is merely a common law doctrine founded on principles of propriety and does not have universal applicability. Even a speaking dismissing the SLP would not attract the doctrine. b) Law declared by the Constitution Bench in Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra) applies retrospectively from 01st January, 2014. Earlier decision of the previous court shall not operate as res judicata, if the law has been altered. 1178 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports c) In the first round, the appellants/authorities were arrayed as respondents merely as a formality, without being adequately heard. As a result, the doctrines of merger or res judicata do not apply and the and issued by this Court in the first round is not binding on these authorities. Such a situation could allow anyone to come forward, get the appeal dismissed, and conclude the lis forever, which is an undesirable outcome. d) By virtue of principles flowing from Rule 4 read with Rule 33 of XLI, Code of Civil Procedure (“CPC” hereafter), this Court possesses ample authority to do complete justice, aligned with principles of justice, equity, and good conscience. The mere fact that a petitioner who filed the SLP in the second round was a party to the first round as a respondent would not warrant the application of the doctrine of res judicata. e) Decisions rendered in the preceding round of litigation, solely relying on s that have since been invalidated and effaced, within a brief timeframe, should not be permitted to result in a miscarriage of justice under the pretext of the doctrine of merger. Each case possesses unique and distinct facts, even if they pertain to a common subject. f) Any factual claim involved in the present appeals may be remanded to the High Court to ensure proper adjudication and prevent miscarriage of justice. On subsequent purchasers contesting acquisition proceedings: g) A or decree obtained through fraudulent means is void and non-existent in the eyes of the law and can be contested even in a collateral proceeding. h) Purchasers subsequent to the issuance of a Notification under section 4(1) of the 1894 Act lack the entitlement to assert the lapse of acquisition proceedings on any grounds. In cases where landowners engaged in fraudulent activities by entering into subsequent sale transactions with prior knowledge of the Notification under section 4(1) of the 1894 Act, such subsequent purchasers lack entitlement to initiate a case for declaration. They do not acquire any legal rights in the land, as the sale is fundamentally void ab initio, thereby disqualifying them from asserting the lapse of acquisition proceedings or claiming the land under the policy. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1179 Government of NCT of Delhi & Anr. v. M/s BSK Realtors LLP & Anr. i) Although the Bench of two Hon’ble Judges in Govt (NCT) of Delhi v. Manav Dharam Trust and another10 had recognised the right of the subsequent purchasers, such decision is no longer good law in view of the same being overruled by a Bench of three Hon’ble Judges in Shiv Kumar and another v. Union of India and others11 and such decision having found approval in Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra).
