25. The decisions rendered by this Court as also by various High Courts are not uniform in this behalf. But, then the broad principle which can be culled out therefrom is that the court at that stage would not consider any evidence or enter into a disputed question of fact or law. In the event, the jurisdiction of the court is found to be barred by any law, meaning thereby, the subject-matter thereof, the application for rejection of plaint should be entertained.” (emphasis supplied) 18. Similar was the view expressed in Shakti Bhog Food Industries Ltd. v. Central Bank of India and another16 and Srihari Hanumandas Totala v. Hemant Vithal Kamat and others17. 19. The law applicable for deciding an application under VII Rule 11 C.P.C. was summed up by this Court in Dahiben v. Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali (Gajra) dead through legal representatives and others18. Relevant parts of paragraph 23 thereof are extracted below: “23 to 23.1 × × × 23.2. The remedy under 7 Rule 11 is an independent and special remedy, wherein the court is empowered to summarily dismiss a suit at the threshold, without proceeding to record evidence, and conducting a trial, on the basis of the evidence adduced, if it is satisfi ed that the action should be terminated on any of the grounds contained in this provision. 23.3. The underlying object of 7 Rule 11(a) is that if in a suit, no cause of action is disclosed, or the suit is barred by limitation under 16 (2020) 17 SCC 260: 2020: INSC:413 17 (2021) 9 SCC 99: 2011: INSC:387 18 (2020) 7 SCC 366: 2020:INSC:450 ELDECO HOUSING AND INDUSTRIES LIMITED v. ASHOK 883 VIDYARTHI AND OTHERS [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] Rule 11(d), the court would not permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the proceedings in the suit. In such a case, it would be necessary to put an end to the sham litigation, so that further judicial time is not wasted. 23.4. In Azhar Hussain v. Rajiv Gandhi 1986 Supp SCC 315, this Court held that the whole purpose of conferment of powers under this provision is to ensure that a litigation which is meaningless, and bound to prove abortive, should not be permitted to waste judicial time of the court, in the following words : “12. … The whole purpose of conferment of such powers is to ensure that a litigation which is meaningless, and bound to prove abortive should not be permitted to occupy the time of the court, and exercise the mind of the respondent. The sword of Damocles need not be kept hanging over his head unnecessarily without point or purpose. Even in an ordinary civil litigation, the court readily exercises the power to reject a plaint, if it does not disclose any cause of action.” 23.5. The power conferred on the court to terminate a civil action is, however, a drastic one, and the conditions enumerated in 7 Rule 11 are required to be strictly adhered to. 23.6. Under 7 Rule 11, a duty is cast on the court to determine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action by scrutinising the averments in the plaint [Liverpool & London S.P.
