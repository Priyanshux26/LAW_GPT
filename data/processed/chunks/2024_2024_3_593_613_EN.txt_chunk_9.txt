]’ Insertion of this ‘Explanation’ was not an amendment of the provision, which would have prospective effect and, thereby, not apply to the application filed on 14.06.1958 under Section 5 of the 1874 Act. The ‘Explanation’ merely explained the position and was not substantive in nature. It is, therefore, deemed to have come into operation from the date on which Section 88(1) was amended in August, 1956. Thereby, the limited applicability of the provision to certain Watan lands was clearly delineated. In turn, Section 23 of the 1874 Act reads as follows: ‘23. Subject to the provisions of this Act and or any other law for the time being in force regarding Service Inams, Cash allowances and Pensions, it shall be the duty of the Collector to fix the annual emoluments of officiators appointed under the provisions of this Act, and to direct the payment thereof to the officiators for the time being. It shall be lawful for the Collector for this purpose to assign watan property, or the profits thereof, towards the emoluments of officiators. The existing assignments shall, until altered by competent authority, be taken to have been made under this section. With the sanction of the State Government the Collector may, as occasion arises, alter the assignment and may increase or diminish it in value, such increase or diminution being made rateably among the holders in proportion to the profit derived by such holders respectively from the watan.’ Thereafter, Section 88CA was inserted in the Tenancy Act by Amendment Act No.63 of 1958 with effect from 11.07.1958. It reads thus: ‘88CA. Sections 32 to 32R not to apply to certain service lands.- Nothing in sections 32 to 32-R (both inclusive), 606 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 33-A, 33-B, 33-C shall apply to land held as inam or watan for service useful to Government but not assigned as remuneration to the person actually performing such service for the time being under section 23 of the Bombay Hereditary Offices Act, 1874, or any other law for the time being in force.’ 20. A conjoint reading of the above provisions indicates that all Watan lands were not to be treated as Government lands. The ‘Explanation’ to Section 88 clarified the position with regard to Watan lands, other than those covered by Section 23 of the 1874 Act, as it manifests that only Watan land assigned as remuneration to an officiator performing service under Section 23 of the 1874 Act etc. shall be deemed to be land belonging to the Government. Thus, only Watan lands covered by Section 23 of the 1874 Act were to be treated as Government lands as per Section 88(1)(a). This is further clarified by Section 88CA inserted in the year 1958, which stated that Sections 32 to 32-R, 33-A, 33-B and 33-C would not apply to land held as Inam or Watan for service useful to the Government, excepting land assigned as remuneration under Section 23 of the 1874 Act etc. It is, therefore, clear that only Watan lands assigned as remuneration for service under Section 23 of the 1874 Act were to be treated as Government lands and stood excluded from the provisions of the Tenancy Act.
