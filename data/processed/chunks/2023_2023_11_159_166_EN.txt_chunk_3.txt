It is not even the case of the appellant. The respondent establishment is merely a pathological laboratory. 9. The stand taken by the appellant is that the respondent establishment will be covered in view of the notifi cation dated 27.05.1976 issued by the Government of Kerala, the relevant part whereof is extracted below: “GOVERNMENT OF KERALA LABOUR (E) DEPARTMENT NOTIFICATION 16141/E2/75/LBR Dated, Trivandaram 27th May 1976 S R O No.559/76 – In exercise of the powers conferred 1948 (Central Act 34 of 1948), the Government of Kerala having already given six months’ notice as required thereunder. The government of Kerala Notifi cation No.16141/E2/75/ LBR dated 5.11.1975 published as SRO BNO.1070/75 in the State Gazette dated 18.11.1975 hereby appoints the midnight of 29th shall extend to the classes of establishment and in areas as specifi ed in the schedule annexed hereto:- 164 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R.

The argument raised by the appellant is that the respondent establishment would fall within the term “shop” and the same is sought to be covered in terms of the aforesaid notifi cation. 11. A notice was issued to the respondent establishment on 27.04.2001, directing production of certain records. The same was replied to. Though it is claimed that the respondent establishment would be covered under the provisions of the Act in terms of the Notifi cation dated 27.05.1976, however, before the E.S.I. Court, reliance was placed on a letter issued by the Corporation on 22.11.2002 through which an earlier Memo dated 06.01.1989, was modifi ed. In terms of the aforesaid Memo letter, pathological laboratories and diagnostics centres were not covered under the defi nition of “shop”. It was not disputed that a “shop” as such is not defi ned under the Act. At the time of hearing, reliance was also placed on the Notifi cation dated 06.09.2007, issued by the Government of Kerala bringing certain establishments under the ambit of the Act. 12. It is not a matter of dispute that such a notifi cation is issued in terms of the power conferred under Section 1(5) of the Act in consultation with the E.S.I.
