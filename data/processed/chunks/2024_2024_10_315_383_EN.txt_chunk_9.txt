5.2 The second issue concerned the legality and propriety of sanction which was challenged on the ground that Rule 3 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) (Recommendation & Sanction of Prosecution) Rules, 20088 was not followed. The Court referred to the contents of the sanction dated 22nd July, 2020, impugned before it, and then concluded that the timeline stipulated in Rule 3 referred to supra, has been strictly adhered to. 5.3 The third issue is as to whether the cognizance is afflicted by non-application of mind. The Court considered the in Bhushan Kumar & Anr. v. State (NCT of Delhi)9 and State of Gujarat v. Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta10 to examine the power of the Magistrate at the stage of issuing process or summons. It was finally concluded that the approach of the learned Special Judge in dealing with the material placed before them by way of case diary, statements of various prosecution witnesses, other documents and material objects, requires no interference. 6. Aggrieved by the above findings of the High Court, the appellant is before this Court. ARGUMENTS ADVANCED 7. We have heard Mr. Balaji Srinivasan, learned Advocate-on-Record for the appellant and Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee, learned Additional Solicitor General of India and Ms. Swarupama Chaturvedi, learned Senior Counsel for the Union of India. 7 [2019] 8 SCR 824 : (2019) 17 SCC 326 8 Hereinafter ‘2008 Rules’ 9 [2012] 2 SCR 696 : (2012) 5 SCC 424 10 [2019] 1 SCR 1104 : (2019) 20 SCC 539 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 329 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. 8. In assailing the impugned , the appellants have advanced the following contentions. 8.1 Section 45 of UAPA read with Rules 3 and 4 of the 2008 Rules provided for a detailed procedure with respect to grant of sanction along with a timeline within which the same is to be granted. The impugned sanction is not in consonance with the statutory mandate as the same was issued 2 years and 11 months after the incident and 2 years and 6 months after the letter dated 12th May, 2017. 8.2 Clause (2) of Section 45 of the UAPA was violated as the requirement of ‘independent review’ while according sanction was not complied with. It is contended that the sanction was passed mechanically without supplying any reasons or application of mind. The s are stereotypical and standard. It is submitted that Section 45 requires independent scrutiny and application of mind at each stage – by requisitioning authority; by an independent agency and then by the sanctioning authority. Since, in the present facts the same was not complied with, sanction s are liable to be quashed. 8.3 Validity of sanction is a question that can be raised at any stage of proceedings. There are instances of this Court setting aside convictions after completion of trial and even quashing entire proceedings upon the filing of bail application, before trial on the ground of invalidity of sanction. In furtherance of this submission, various s have been referred to.
