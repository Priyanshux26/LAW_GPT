Therefore, till the year 2020-2021, the stage of field demonstration within an area of five acres at two or three different locations had not yet been cleared by GEAC with regard to transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11. 42.4 When the matter stood thus, Prof. Deepak Pental, on behalf of CGMCP, Delhi University (South Campus), the applicant, vide his letter dated 10.05.2022, wrote directly to the Hon’ble Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change seeking acceptance of the recommendations for environmental release of transgenic mustard hybrid DMH- 11 made in the 133rd GEAC meeting. The aforesaid letter is extracted as under: [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2101 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. “CENTRE FOR GENETIC MANIPULATION OF CROP PLANT (CGMCP) UNIVERSITY OF DELHI SOUTH CAMPUS BENTO JUAREZ ROAD, NEW DELHI-110021, INDIA Phone : 91-11-24112609, 24116392 Fax: 91-11-24116392 Shri Bhupender Yadav May 10, 2022 Hon’ble Minister Minister of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC) Indira Paryavaran Bhawan Aliganj Road, Jorbagh New Delhi – 110 003 Subject: Request for environmental release of GE mustard Respected Minister, I am writing to you on the environmental release of the Genetic Engineering-based technology for hybrid seed production in mustard, a major oilseed crop of our country. Some recent positive, as well as negative developments, have induced me to write to you on the matter which is pending with MoEFCC. The positive development is the Union Governments’ decision to put SDN-1 and SDN-2 types of gene edited crops out of the biosafety regimes stipulated for the Generally Engineered (GE) crops. This is indeed a major step forward. Barring the EU, most of the development countries have already reduced biosafety requirements for genome-edited crops. The negative development is continuing stagnation of the edible oil sector in India. While the demand for edible oils is increasing globally, the supplies are under stress leading to a spurt in the prices of edible oils in the international markets. As our country imports more than fifty per cent of its edible oil requirement there is an urgency to increase our domestic production. 2102 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Our group at the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP), University of Delhi South Campus has been working on increasing the yield of mustard for the past 30 years. A report on the research work being caried out at the Centre is being attached with this letter. The most appropriate technology for yield increase in mustard is hybrid breeding for which a robust hybrid seed production system is foundational; our GE-based hybrid seed production system meets the need. I believe the time has come for MoEFCC to permit environmental release of the GE technology for hybrid seed production to increase edible oil production in the country. To brief you on the past developments, the biosafety studies on the transgenic parental lines Varuna bn 3.6 and EH2 modbs 2.99 and the first generation hybrid DMH-11 were initiated in the year 2010. All the stipulated biosafety studies including field testing under isolation were carried out and a 3251-page dossier was submitted to GEAC on September 15, 2015.
