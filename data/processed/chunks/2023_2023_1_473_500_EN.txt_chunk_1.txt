Dismissing the appeals, the Court F HELD: 1. The welfare State plays a crucial role in aiding the realisation of the socio-economic rights which are recognised by the Constitution. Social welfare benefits provided by the State under the rubric of its constitutional obligations are commonly understood in the language of ‘largesse’, a term used to describe G a generous donation. Terming all actions of government, ranging from social security benefits, jobs, occupational licenses, contracts and use of public resources – as government largesse results in doctrinal misconceptions. The reason is that this conflates the State’s power with duty. The Constitution recognises the pursuit H M/S IMPCL v. KERALA AYURVEDIC CO OPERATIVE SOCIETY LTD. 475 & ORS. of the well-being of citizens as a desirable goal. In doing this the A Constitution entrusts the State with a duty to ensure the well- being of citizens. Government actions aimed at ensuring the well- being of citizens cannot be perceived through the lens of a ‘largess’. The use of such terminology belittles the sanctity of the social contract that the ‘people of India’ entered into with the B State to protect and safeguard their interests.

Inviting tenders and conducting public auctions are considered to be preferred methods of allocation for two reasons: firstly procurement can be made at the best price; and secondly, allocation is through a transparent process. However, if the F purpose of allocation by the State is not revenue maximization, the State could award contracts through other methods, provided it is non-arbitrary and meets the requirements of Article 14. Government contracts involve expenditure out of the public exchequer. Since they involve payment out of the public G exchequer, the moneys expended must not be spent arbitrarily. The State does not have absolute discretion while spending public money. All government actions including government contracts awarded by the State must be tested on the touchstone of Article 14. The following principles emerge from the discussion : (i) H 476 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A Government action must be just, fair and reasonable and in accordance with the principles of Article 14; and (ii) While government can deviate from the route of tenders or public auctions for the grant of contracts, the deviation must not be discriminatory or arbitrary.
