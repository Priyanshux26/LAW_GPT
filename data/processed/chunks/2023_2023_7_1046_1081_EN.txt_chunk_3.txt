A goods and products described as pan masala and gutkha, were included in Chapter 21. The conclusion therefore, is that till 2001, and the introduction of ADE, these two products were covered by local or sales tax levies. On a plain application of the interpretive rules, especially Rule 3(a) it is clear that the heading which provides the most accurate description has to be followed. B In the present case, there is no doubt, that before 2001, pan masala and gutkha fell within Chapter 21, as pan masala, regardless of whether they contained tobacco. Goods classifiable under Chapter 24, i.e. tobacco items were more general; also they did not include pan masala. As regards the question of the C rate of tax, in view of the restrictions under Section 15 CST Act, neither gutkha nor pan masala were “declared goods” under Section 14 of the CST Act. The amendment to the CET Act did not become part of Section 14(ix). The goods under the relevant sub-headings of the CET Act were absent in the list of declared goods of the CST Act; they were not part of the provisions D introduced to the Finance Act, 1988. Therefore, the subsequent changes made introducing 2404.40 in the CET Act do not affect or change the CST Act. Consequently gutkha and pan masala are not covered under sub-heading 2404.40 so far as CST Act is concerned. Resultantly the arguments of the assessees that the E rate of local tax, cannot exceed the limit under the CST Act, are rejected as unmerited.
