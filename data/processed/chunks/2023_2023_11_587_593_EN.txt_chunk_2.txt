Hence, it cannot be said to be a case of suicide or drunken driving. Relying upon the of this Court in Param Pal Singh Through Father v. National Insurance Co. & Anr., (2013) 3 SCC 409 and Northeast Karnataka Road Transport Corporation. v. Sujatha, (2019) 11 SCC 514, the argument advanced is that the dependents of the deceased are entitled to receive compensation. 6. On the other hand, learned counsel for the Insurance Company submitted that it is not in dispute that the deceased was not driving the vehicle at the time of his death. On the basis of the material produced on record, his death was not directly caused by any accident. The incident may have taken place in the course of employment, but it is not arising out of employment. Furthermore, the respondents argued that there is no evidence on record indicating that the deceased had suff ered a heart attack due to stress and strain of driving the truck. It was a Policy purchased by the owner of the vehicle in terms of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Hence, the claim should have been made under that Act. However, that was not availed of, because the death was not the result of a motor accident. There is no error in the passed by the High Court. The appeal deserves to be dismissed. Reliance was placed by Ld. counsel upon Ved Prakash Garg v. Premi Devi and Others (1997) 8 SMT. DARIYAO KANWAR & ORS. v. M/S UNITED INDIA 591 INSURANCE CO. LTD. & ANR. [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] SCC 1; National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Prembai Patel and others, (2005) 6 SCC 172. 7. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records. The facts evident from the records are that the deceased Sumer Singh was employed as a driver on vehicle bearing Truck no. DL-1G-B-3976, which was owned by the respondent No. 2. The same was fully insured. The Insurance Policy was eff ective from 30.06.2003 to 29.06.2004. As per the terms of the Policy available on record, an additional premium was paid to cover two employees for any compensation payable under the 1923 Act. While driving the vehicle from Delhi to Baroda, the health of the deceased deteriorated on 15.09.2003 at about 12:30 a.m. at Goverdhan Vilas, Udaipur (Rajasthan) and he died. Thereafter, the postmortem was conducted. On chemical examination of portions of viscera and blood samples, metallic poisons, ethyl and methyl alcohol, cyanide, alkaloids, barbiturates, tranquillizers and insecticides, were not found. This report rules out that the death was on account of consumption of poisonous material or liquor. FIR No. 18/2003 dated 15.09.2003 was also registered. It was pleaded in the application fi led by the appellants before the Commissioner that the deceased was drawing a monthly salary of ` 3,091/-(Rupees three thousand and ninety one) plus ` 50/-(Rupees fi fty) per day as allowance. The appellants were dependents on the deceased as its widow and children. 8. The Commissioner accepted the application fi led by the appellants.
