17. The English and American precedents and legislation G are not of such help. The Public Act, 1936 was passed because in 1936 different political organisations marched in uniforms causing riots. In America the First Amendment freedoms have no such qualifications as in India and the rulings are apt to be misapplied to our Constitution.” H 540 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 12.4 Thereafter in the case of Supdt., Central Prison vs. Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, (1960) 2 SCR 821, this Court had taken note of the difference in the American Law and the Indian Law more particularly the restrictions under Article 19(2). 12.5 Thereafter in the case of Ramlila Maidan Incident, In re, B (2012) 5 SCC 1, it is observed and held in paragraphs 7 to 11 on applicability of the American doctrine/US Supreme Court decisions as under: “7. In contradistinction to the above approach of the US Supreme Court, the Indian Constitution spells out the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a). It also C provides the right to assemble peacefully and without arms to every citizen of the country under Article 19(1)(b). However, these rights are not free from any restrictions and are not absolute in their terms and application. Articles 19(2) and 19(3), respectively, control the freedoms available to a citizen. Article 19(2) empowers the D State to impose reasonable restrictions on exercise of the right to freedom of speech and expression in the interest of the factors stated in the said clause. Similarly, Article 19(3) enables the State to make any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred, again in the interest of the factors stated therein. E 8. In face of this constitutional mandate, the American doctrine adumbrated in Schenck case [63 L Ed 470 : 249 US 47 (1919)] cannot be imported and applied. Under our Constitution, this right is not an absolute right but is subject to the abovenoticed restrictions. Thus, the position under our Constitution is different. F 9. In Constitutional Law of India by H.M. Seervai (4th Edn. ), Vol. 1, the author has noticed that the provisions of the two Constitutions as to freedom of speech and expression are essentially different. The difference being accentuated by the provisions of the Indian Constitution for preventive detention which G have no counterpart in the US Constitution. Reasonable restriction contemplated under the Indian Constitution brings the matter in the domain of the court as the question of reasonableness is a question primarily for the court to decide. (Babulal Parate v. State of Maharashtra [AIR 1961 SC 884 : (1961) 2 Cri LJ 16 : (1961) H 3 SCR 423]) ARUP BHUYAN v. STATE OF ASSAM & ANR. 541 [M. R. SHAH, J.] 10. The fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution itself A being made subject to reasonable restrictions, the laws so enacted to specify certain restrictions on the right to freedom of speech and expression have to be construed meaningfully and with the constitutional object in mind.
