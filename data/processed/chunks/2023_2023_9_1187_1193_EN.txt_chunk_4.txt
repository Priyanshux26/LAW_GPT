We observe that the submissions made on behalf of the insurance company before the NCDRC are contrary to the evidence on record as a result of which the appellant herein has been not only deprived of the aforesaid amount spent by him towards medical expenses owing F to the injuries sustained by the injured Ram Parshad Tharu in the accident in respect of which there is a third-party insurance coverage, but also has been constrained to approach this Court. We find that the stand of the insurer in this case is not fair and just. 16.
