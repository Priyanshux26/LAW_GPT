of the products. It is contended that the assessee despite being aware of the fact that their product was not covered under relevant notifi cation which provides for valuation under Section 4A of CE Act, had continued to avail the benefi t of Section 4A of CE Act till 11.07.2006. It is contended by the Revenue, that abatement provided to the goods classifi able under CET SH 2403 9910 i.e., ‘chewing tobacco’ was 50 percent, therefore if the goods are cleared as ‘chewing tobacco’ the duty has to be paid on lower value, resulting in payment of such amount of duty as the value determined under Section 4A of CE Act, after 50 percent abatement, which was much less as compared to transaction value under Section 4 of CE Act. It is further contended by the Revenue that ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was brought into the ambit of Section 4A of CE Act, by amendment to Notifi cation No.16 dated 11.07.2006 and thus the product ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was not specifi ed for assessment under Section 4A of the CE Act, for the period 01.03.2006 to 10.07.2006. Hence, the Revenue sought to justify the demand of duty short paid by the assessee by invoking the proviso under Section 11A (1), along with interest, at the appropriate rate under Section 11AB of the Act 1944. 25. The learned Senior counsel for the Revenue would further elaborate his submissions by contending that the assessee has not shown any proof of record for concluding that ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ is also ‘chewing tobacco’. By contending that this tariff classifi cation was in force during the period of the board’s letter dated 23.06.1987, notice dated 15.07.1987, and the notifi cation dated 16.03.1995 and as such they would not come to the rescue of the assessee. It is also urged that the tariff has been aligned to 8 digits and more specifi cally calculation has been provided where ‘chewing tobacco’ and ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ have been separately classifi ed and as such the contention of the assessee has no legs to stand. 26. The Revenue would further contend that the assessee is selling its product as “zafrani zarda” and as such it cannot claim ‘zarda/jarda’ used in the tariff heading is diff erent from ‘zarda/jarda’ used by assessee and further, the assessee has not been able to demonstrate how its product is diff erent from ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ mentioned in the tariff . The Revenue would also contend that once the product is sold as ‘zarda/jarda’, which is specifi cally covered under CET SH 2403 9930, it cannot claim that COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. AHMEDABAD v. M/S URMIN 593 PRODUCTS P. LTD. AND OTHERS [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] the said product would fall CET SH 2403 9910 as ‘chewing tobacco’. The Revenue has drawn the attention of this Court to the fact that assessee earlier classifi ed the product as ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’, and there being no change in classifi cation of the product, to pay duty at lesser value would be without any justifi cation.
