8. That after the impugned was dictated in open court on 17.8.2023 and subsequently uploaded on the website of Hon’ble Bombay High Court on 26.8.2023, the following developments have taken place: a. The Respondent No.1 and Respondent no.2 transferred an amount of Rs. 104 Crores to the Respondent No. 3 i.e. Union Bank of India vide RTGS, having UTR No. HDFCR52023082882894716. b. This was followed by the Respondent No.3 1.e. Union Bank of India issuing a No Dues Certificate dated 28.08.2023 thereby acknowledging that the Respondent No.1 does not owe any further amount to the Bank and releasing the personal guarantees as well. c. Further, after the No Dues Certificate was issued by Respondent No. 3, Respondent No.1 executed a registered Deed of Release [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1681 Celir LLP v. Mr. Sumati Prasad Bafna & Ors. with Tata Motors Financial Solutions Limited registered with the Joint Sub Registrar, Thane 8 having registration No. 19283/2023, whereby the second charge that Tata Motors Finance Solutions Limited had on the second property came to be released, pursuant to payment of Rs. 15 Crores (Rs. 10 Crores on 18.08.2023 and Rs. 5 Crores on 22.08.2023 ), which came to be duly acknowledged by Tata Motors Finance Solutions Limited. d. Following this, the Respondent No. 1 has also entered into a registered Agreement of Assignment of Leasehold Rights for transfer of leasehold rights in the secured asset with M/s Greenscape L.T. Park LLP on 28.8.2023, which came to be registered before the Joint Sub Registrar, Thane 8 having registration No. 19286/2023. Copies of Documents issued/ registered/executed subsequent to passing of the Impugned are attached herewith as Annexure R-1 (Colly). 9. Since there has been full compliance of the Impugned by the Respondent No.1 herein as well as the Respondent No.3 Bank, the SLP has essentially become infructuous. 10. The only issue which remains is the refund of the amount deposited by the Petitioner herein. This is an issue between the Petitioner and the Respondent No.3 Bank and the Respondent No.1 has no reason to come in the way of the refund of the amount to the Petitioner herein. 11. There is a specific direction of the Hon’ble High Court that the Respondent Bank shall immediately keep the entire amount of Rs. 105.05 Crores (deposited by the Auction Purchaser/Petitioner herein) in a ‘No Lien Interest Bearing Account’ and if the Respondent No.1 pays the balance amount of Rs. 104 Crores to the Respondent Bank by 31.8.2023 (which it has), 1682 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports then the Respondent Bank shall refund the amount of Rs. 105.05 Crores deposited by the Auction Purchaser together with accrued interest on or before 7.9.2023. The impugned correctly interprets Section 13(8) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security interest Act,2002 (SARFAESI Act): 12. During the arguments on 01.9.2023, the main issue of contention that arose was till what stage does the right of redemption survive, more so, in the light of the 2016 Amendment which amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, 2002.
