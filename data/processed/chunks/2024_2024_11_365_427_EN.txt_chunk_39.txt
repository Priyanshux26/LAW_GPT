As noted above, the RTE Act, which is the legislation framed by Parliament pursuant to Entry 25, specifically states that it is inapplicable to Madarsas, and thus, there is no issue of a conflict or repugnancy between the two Acts. 90. In view of the above, there is no jurisprudential basis to read Entry 25, List III to be limited to only education that is devoid of any religious 111 [2002] Supp. 3 SCR 587 : (2002) 8 SCC 481 112 Ibid [3-4]. 113 Article 254, Constitution of India. 114 Forum for People’s Collective Efforts v. State of W.B. (2021) 8 SCC 599 [116] 418 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports teaching or instruction and to contend that the Madarsa Act (in its entirety) which seeks to regulate the functioning of Madarsas in Uttar Pradesh is outside the competence of the state legislature. The challenge on the ground of legislative competence fails. b. Certain provisions of the Madarsa Act conflict with the UGC Act enacted under Entry 66, List I 91. As noted above, Entry 25 of List III has been made subject to certain entries in List I. One of these entries is Entry 66 of List I, which reads as follows: “66. Co-ordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions.” 92. In Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. vs. Steel Authority of India & Anr.,115 a Constitution Bench of this Court had occasion to observe the purport of the legislative entries in List II using the phrase “subject to” in the following terms: “44. Where the entries have used the phrase “subject to”, the legislative power of the State is made subordinate to Parliament with respect to either the Union List or the Concurrent List. The expression “subject to” conveys the idea of a provision yielding place to another provision or other provisions to which it is made subject. Therefore, where the Constitution intends to displace or override the legislative powers of the States, it has used specific terminology – “subject to”. However, the Constitution has also indicated the extent to which a particular legislative entry under List II is subordinated. For instance, the subjection is either with respect to provisions of List I or List III, or it can also be to the extent of “any limitations” imposed by Parliament by law. Thus, it is imperative that the entries in List II must be read and interpreted in their proper context to understand the extent of their subordination to Union powers.” (emphasis supplied) 115 [2024] 8 SCR 540 : 2024 INSC 607 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 419 Anjum Kadari & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. 93. The UGC Act has been enacted by Parliament pursuant to Entry 66 and seeks to make provisions for the “co-ordination and determination of standards in Universities and for that purpose, to establish a University Grants Commission.”116 The Madarsa Act has been enacted pursuant to Entry 25 of List III. This Court has held in a consistent line of precedent that the UGC Act occupies the field with regard to the coordination and determination of standards in higher education.
