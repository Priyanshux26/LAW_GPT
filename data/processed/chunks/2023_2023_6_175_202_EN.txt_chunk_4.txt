128 for the consideration of Rs. 3000/- would indicate that the balance amount of Rs. 7000/- was the consideration for the balance extent of land covered under Ext. 128. Since the D validity of the sale deed dated 04.07.1978 was not an issue/ question that could be raised by the second defendant against the first defendant in the subject suit and was rightly, not raised as an issue, the first defendant not only did not dispute the sale of such extent to the plaintiff but admitted the joint execution of E Ext. 128 and receipt of sale consideration, as incorporated in Ext. 128 and since the second defendant got no case that he had assailed the validity of the sale deed dated 04.07.1978 either before any competent authority or competent Civil Court this question needs no further elaboration. An inter-se dispute on the validity of the sale deed dated 04.07.1978, if at all between F the second and first defendants, could not have been considered in the subject-suit, for the reasons already mentioned as it would amount to adjudication of right or a claim, by way of counter-claim by one defendant against his co-defendant. Finding on its voidness under the Fragmentation Act was already held as unsustainable. G [Para 34][200-B-H; 201-A-B] 1.11 By virtue of Section 54, of the Transfer of Property Act and Section 17 of the Registration Act and since the immovable property was worth more than Rs. 100/- Ext.128 was reduced in writing and registered. The intention of the parties H are also reflected specifically in Ext.128 and at the same, nothing DAMODHAR NARAYAN SAWALE (D) THROUGH LRS. v. SHRI 181 TEJRAO BAJIRAO MHASKE & ORS. reflecting a contraintention not to pass the title and ownership in A present even impliedly therein. In other words, the need to take into consideration the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of parties in deciding the passing of title would arise only if the recitals in the document are indecisive and ambiguous. The oral evidence of the second defendant could not override the B registered Ext. 128 sale deed, as held by the First Appellate Court in the facts, circumstances and evidence on record in this case. In such circumstances, no other question(s) need be considered. The High Court committed a serious error based on perverse appreciation of evidence, in setting aside the and decree of the First Appellate Court decreeing the subject suit and in C restoring the decree of dismissal of the suit of the trial court. [Para 35][201-E-H] 1.12 The and final in Second Appeal passed by the High Court restoring the decree of the Civil Judge is set aside. The and decree of the Additional District Judge D is restored.
