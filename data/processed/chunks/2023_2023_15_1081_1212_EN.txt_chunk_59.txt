Thus, this Court gave eff ect to the intention of the legislature in minimizing the role of the courts at the pre-arbitral stage to the bare minimum. 148. Thereafter, in Vidya Drolia (supra), another three-Judge Bench of this Court, affi rmed the ruling in Mayavati Trading (supra) that Patel Engineering (supra) has been legislatively overruled. In Vidya Drolia (supra), one of the issues before this Court was whether the court at the reference stage or the arbitral tribunal in the arbitration proceedings would decide the question of non-arbitrability. This Court began its analysis by holding that an arbitration agreement has to satisfy the mandate of the Contract Act, in addition to satisfying the requirements stipulated under Section 7 of the Arbitration Act to qualify as an agreement. 149. In the course of the decision, one of the questions before this Court in Vidya Drolia (supra) was the interpretation of the word “existence” as appearing in Section 11. It was held that existence and validity are intertwined. Further, it was observed that an arbitration agreement does not exist if it is illegal or does not satisfy mandatory legal requirements. Therefore, this Court read the mandate of valid arbitration agreement 146 “2019 Amendment Act” 147 (2019) 8 SCC 714 IN RE: INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UNDER 1165 THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT 1996 AND THE INDIAN STAMP ACT 1899 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI ] contained in Section 8 into the mandate of Section 11, that is, “existence of an arbitration agreement.” 150. At the outset, Vidya Drolia (supra) noted that “Section 11 has undergone another amendment vide Act 33 of 2019 with eff ect from 9-8- 2019.” The purport of the omission of the said clause was further explained in the following terms: “145. Omission of sub-section (6-A) by Act 33 of 2019 was with the specifi c object and purpose and is relatable to by substitution of sub- sections (12), (13) and (14) of Section 11 of the Arbitration Act by Act 33 of 2019, which, vide sub-section (3-A) stipulates that the High Court and this Court shall have the power to designate the arbitral institutions which have been so graded by the Council under Section 43-I, provided where a graded arbitral institution is not available, the High Court concerned shall maintain a panel of arbitrators for discharging the function and thereupon the High Court shall perform the duty of an arbitral institution for reference to the Arbitral Tribunal. Therefore, it would be wrong to accept that post omission of sub-section (6-A) of Section 11 the ratio in Patel Engg. Ltd. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] would become applicable.” 151. Vidya Drolia (supra) proceeds on the presumption that Section 11(6A) was effectively omitted from the statute books by the 2019 Amendment Act. This is also refl ected in the conclusion arrived at by the Court, as is evident from the following extract: “154.1. Ratio of the decision in Patel Engg. Ltd. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg.
