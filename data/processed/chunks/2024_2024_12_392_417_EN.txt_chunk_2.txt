1’s culpability – The courts below have correctly observed that the appellant’s role in the crime is incomparable to that of his co-accused – The principle of parity does not apply in the present case, as the appellant’s [2024] 12 S.C.R. 395 Kunhimuhammed@Kunheethu v. The State of Kerala actions were materially different from those of his co-accused. [Paras 27.2, 27.6, 27.7] Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 324 and 326/34 – Appellant convicted u/ss.302, 324 and 326/34 of IPC and sentenced to life imprisonment – Plea of old age and deteriorating health: Held: A murder committed with the intent to target vital organs, particularly in a group setting, reflects a level of intent and cruelty that demands an appropriate punitive response – To reduce the sentence in such a case would risk undermining the seriousness of the crime and the sanctity of life itself, principles that the judicial system is duty-bound to uphold – While the Court acknowledges the appellant’s advanced age and medical condition, these factors cannot outweigh the need for justice and the imperative to uphold the rule of law – When the minimum sentence itself is life imprisonment, then grounds like parity, leniency, old age, health concerns, etc. shall not be of any aid to the accused while seeking reduction of sentence – Therefore, the appellant herein has been granted the minimum sentence for committing the offence of murder.
