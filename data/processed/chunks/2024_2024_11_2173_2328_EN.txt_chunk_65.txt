If in such field it is the custom and practice for parties frequently to appoint the same arbitrator in difference cases, this is a relevant fact to be taken into account while applying the rules set out above.”] [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2255 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company second requirement of the proviso to Section 12(5) is that parties must consciously abandon their existing legal right through an express agreement. Thus, the Arbitration Act reinforces the autonomy of parties by allowing them to override the limitations of independence and impartiality by an express agreement in that regard. 122. The proviso to Section 12(5) is a reflection of the common law doctrine of necessity. The nemo judex rule is subject to the doctrine of necessity and yields to it.230 The doctrine of necessity allows an adjudicator who may be disqualified because of their interest in the matter to continue to adjudicate because of the necessity of the circumstances.231 The proviso to Section 12(5) allows parties to exercise their autonomy to determine if there is a necessity to waive the applicability of the ineligibility prescribed under Section 12(5). Thus, common law principles and doctrines are adjusted to subserve the fundamental principles of arbitration by giving priority to the autonomy of parties. 123. In Bharat Broadband Network Ltd. (supra), this Court held that the proviso to Section 12(5) requires an express agreement in writing, that is, an agreement made in words as opposed to an agreement that can be inferred by conduct.232 It was explained that such an agreement must be made by both parties with full knowledge of the fact that although a particular person is ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator, the parties still have full faith and confidence in them to continue as an arbitrator.233 The principle of express waiver contained under the proviso to Section 12(5) also applies to situations where the parties seek to waive the allegation of bias against an arbitrator appointed unilaterally by one of the parties. After the disputes have arisen, the parties can determine whether there is a necessity to waive the nemo judex rule. This balances the autonomy of parties and the principles of an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal. 230 Tulsiram Patel (supra) [101]; Swadeshi Cotton Mills v.

(supra) [20] [This Court observed: “20. […] It is thus necessary that there be an “express” agreement in writing. This agreement must be an agreement by which both parties, with full knowledge of the fact that Shri Khan is ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator, still go ahead and say that they have full faith and confidence in him to continue as such.”] 2256 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports vi. Unilateral appointment of arbitrators is violative of the equality clause under Section 18 124.
