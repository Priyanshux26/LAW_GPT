For these reasons, he has held that Section 6A does not suffer from manifest arbitrariness. 8 14. Equality before law.— The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. 9 Paragraphs 164 and 166 of the of Justice Surya Kant. 10 Id., paragraphs 187-190. 11 Id., paragraphs 230-232. 12 Id., paragraphs 238-241. 1152 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 15. I am in agreement with the view taken by Justice Surya Kant that it was permissible for the legislature to enact Section 6A of the Citizenship Act solely for the State of Assam in view of the extraordinary conditions prevailing therein and the Assam Accord which was entered into as a culmination of such circumstances. Further, I concur with his view that Section 6A cannot be said to be violative of Article 14 for being under-inclusive. However, I differ from his views on the aspect of manifest arbitrariness for the reasons that I have assigned in the later parts of this . I am also of the considered view that Section 6A has acquired unconstitutionality subsequent to its enactment in 1985 by efflux of time and has thus become violative of Article 14 for being temporally unreasonable. I have dealt with this aspect too in detail in the later parts of this . 16. The next issue which my learned brother has dealt with pertains to the violation of the Article 2913 of the Constitution on account of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act. The view taken by him is that Section 6A does not deal with culture, but merely prescribes the conditions for conferment of citizenship on certain categories of immigrants. Thus, any impact on culture is only incidental and not direct or intentional. He has also held that Section 6A does not compel the pre-1971 immigrants to continue to reside within the territory of Assam after having obtained Indian citizenship which entitles them to reside and settle in any part of the country.14 In the ultimate analysis, he has held that due to the failure of the petitioners to establish an actionable impact on Assamese culture, Section 6A cannot be held to be violative of Article 29 of the Constitution.15 17. Justice Surya Kant has also considered the issue as to whether Section 6A of the Citizenship Act is violative of Article 2116 of the Constitution, and has held that the petitioners have failed to show 13 29. Protection of interests of minorities.— (1) Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same. (2) No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. 14 Paragraphs 297-298 of the of Justice Surya Kant. 15 Id., paragraphs 300, 304.
