However, the fi rst proviso to sub-section (2) thereof provides that a teacher who, at the commencement of this Act, does not possess minimum qualifi cations as laid down under sub-section (1), shall acquire such minimum qualifi cations within a period of fi ve years. 18.

It provides that every teacher appointed or in position as on 31st March 2015, who does not possess minimum qualifi cations as laid down under sub-section (1), shall acquire such minimum qualifi cations within a period of four years from the date of commencement of the 2017 Amendment Act. JAIVEER SINGH AND OTHERS v. THE STATE OF 609 UTTARAKHAND AND OTHERS [B. R. GAVAI, J.] 19. It can further be seen that in exercise of powers conferred under sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act, the Central Government authorised NCTE as an academic authority to lay down the minimum qualifi cations for a person to be eligible for appointment as a teacher. Accordingly, NCTE issued a notifi cation on 23rd August 2010 prescribing the minimum qualifi cations. The said notifi cation came to be amended by notifi cation dated 29th July 2011. Undisputedly, the said notifi cation was issued by NCTE in exercise of its powers under sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act. 20. The Government of Uttarakhand, vide notifi cation dated 28th August 2012, notifi ed the 2012 Service Rules. The minimum qualifi cations provided under the 2012 Service Rules was 2 years Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed.) known as B.T.C. in Uttarakhand from the concerned District Institute of Education and Training/District Resource Centre. The said 2012 Service Rules were amended in the year 2014. However, insofar as the requirement of 2 years D.El.Ed. course is concerned, it remained the same. 21. NCTE, in exercise of powers conferred under Clause (dd) of sub- section (2) of Section 32 read with Section 12A of the NCTE Act, notifi ed 2014 Regulations providing for minimum qualifi cations. Insofar as Class I to VIII are concerned, the minimum qualifi cations as provided in the earlier notifi cations remained the same. 22. As discussed hereinabove, the second proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the RTE Act was inserted by 2017 Amendment Act, however, with retrospective eff ect from 1st April 2015. As such, the teachers, who were appointed or in position as on 31st March 2015, were required to acquire the requisite qualifi cations within a period of 4 years from 1st Apil 2015. The communication dated 3rd August 2017 addressed by the Additional Secretary, MHRD will clarify the position, which reads thus: “This is regarding training of untrained in-service elementary teachers in the Govt./Govt. Aided/Unaided-Private Schools. It is apprised that the Amendment to the Section 23 (2) of the RTE Act to extend the period for such training to 31st March, 2019 has been passed by the Parliament.
