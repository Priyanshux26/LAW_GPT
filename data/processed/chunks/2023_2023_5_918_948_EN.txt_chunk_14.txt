In default, the Magistrate shall release the accused on bail. This is subject to the restriction imposed in Section 436-A, providing B for the maximum period for which, an under-trial prisoner may be detained. Chapter XXXVI provides for limitation for taking cognizance in certain offences. Section 468 imposes a bar on taking cognizance of an offence specified in sub-section (2) after the expiry of the period of limitation. Section 469 provides for commencement of period of limitation C and it is to be noted that while setting out the date on which the period of limitation would have started, sub-section (2) states that in computing the period of limitation, the day from which such period is to be computed, shall be excluded. Barring the said provision contained in Section 468 and Section 436A, there is no limitation prescribed in completion of investigation and the investigation may continue except for the default- D bail right which accrues to the accused on expiry of the 60th or 90th day, in terms of the first proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167. Thus, the legislative intent providing for the 60/90 day statutory period- serves a twin purpose, firstly speedy trial of the accused which would transform him into a convict or his release on culmination of the trial and secondly, E to assure speedy justice to the victim and to the society in general. 25. The insertion of proviso (a) to Section 167(2) of the Code was examined and analyzed in Chaganti (supra). In writing the two-judge bench opinion in the case, S. Natarajan J. had the occasion to examine the reasoning and the ratio in Rajoo alias Raj Kishore Singh Vs. State F of Bihar15 as also the High Court decisions in Raj Kumar Vs. State of Punjab16, Batna Ram vs. State of H.P17, Jagdish vs. State of M.P.18 and N. Sureya Reddy vs. State of Orissa (supra) and the learned Judge observed the following :- “31. Some of the decisions cited on either side have been G rendered prior to the amendment of proviso (a) by Act 45 of 1978 and some have been rendered after the amendment. Mr. 15 (1980) 1 SCC 108 16 AIR 1979 P&H 80 17 1980 Crl. LJ 748 (HP) H 18 1984 Crl. LJ 79 (MP) ENFORCEMENT DIRECTORATE, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA v. 937 KAPIL WADHAWAN & ANR. ETC. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] Ram Reddy sought to make a distinction of the earlier decisions A by contending that they ceased to have relevance because of the amendment to proviso (a) making it an independent paragraph all by itself. Since, we have held that in whichever way proviso (a) is construed i.e. with reference to Section 167(2) or without reference to it the periods of 90 days and B 60 days prescribed by the legislature can be reckoned only from the date of remand the distinction sought to be made between the decisions rendered prior to Amendment Act 45 of 1978 and subsequent to it does not have much of significance.
