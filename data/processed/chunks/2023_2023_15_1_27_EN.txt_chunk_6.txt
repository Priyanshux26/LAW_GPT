Om Prakash Yadav was arrested on 05.04.2013 at 15:30 hours under an Arrest Memo (Ex. P24). 11. The hair seized from the right fi st of the deceased was sent for DNA analysis and for comparison with the blood samples of Rajesh Yadav and Raja Yadav. The DNA Test Report revealed that the said hair belonged to Rajesh Yadav. The autopsy of the body was done by Dr. Vivek Shrivastav (PW-7). His postmortem report (Ex. P7) indicated that the death had occurred 3 to 5 days prior to the examination and the cause of death was haemorrhagic shock which occurred due to the throat being cut prior to death. The postmortem examination was conducted by him at 10:15 hours on 30.03.2013. 12. According to the prosecution, the ransom calls were made by Raja Yadav by inserting the SIM card with mobile number 8305620342 into Om Prakash Yadav’s mobile phone handset bearing IMEI No. 358327028551270. Thereafter, the said SIM card was destroyed and Om Prakash Yadav’s SIM card with mobile number 9993135127 was inserted into the handset. As per the prosecution, though the ransom calls were made during the morning hours on 28.03.2013, Ajit Pal was killed on the night of 26.03.2013 itself by Rajesh Yadav and Raja Yadav. They lured him by off ering him alcohol, whereupon Raja Yadav and Ajit Pal drank whisky. Raja Yadav then caught hold of Ajit Pal and Rajesh Yadav cut his throat. Rajesh Yadav then got a white plastic sack and they hid the body in the well. This, in sum and substance, was the prosecution’s case. 13. Before parting with the factual narrative, we may note that the prosecution tried to project Puran Singh (PW-3) as a witness to buttress a ‘last seen’ theory so as to build up a stronger case. This witness stated that his daughter was married to PW-2. He stated that he knew the accused also. He claimed that on 26.03.2013 at 6 pm, he had gone to Narmada Nagar to give a box of sweets to his daughter for Holi. He further stated that, after leaving her house, he reached the railway crossing and met Raja Yadav, Rajesh Yadav and Ajit Pal. Ajit Pal greeted him and he asked Ajit Pal why he was not at home as it was past 9 pm. Ajit Pal told him that he was going to see the ‘Holika’ and left with the others. PW-3 stated that he then went home and was informed by his daughter on 28.03.2013 that Ajit Pal had been 10 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. kidnapped and ransom calls had been made. On 29.03.2013, his daughter informed him that Ajit Pal’s dead body was found inside a well and that Raja Yadav, Rajesh Yadav, Brijesh Yadav and Om Prakash Yadav had helped recover it. PW-3 stated that he went for Ajay Pal’s last rites on 30.03.2013 and when he met the TownInspectorat the crossing, he told him that he had met Ajit Pal along with Raja Yadav and Rajesh Yadav on 26.03.2013.
