That apart, it is well-established in law that the non-floating of tenders alone does not constitute a sufficient basis to deem the actions of a public authority as arbitrary and illegal, nor does it invalidate the consequential contract. (d) The Concession Agreement resulted from extensive deliberations and consultations among various Government entities over several years and thus could not be termed as an arbitrary decision. It received approval from the Steering Committee, which comprised of representatives from all stakeholders, and the Empowered Committee established by the State. Additionally, the World Bank, which provided funding for the Project through a line of credit to IL&FS, also endorsed the Agreement. The Concession Agreement being an outcome of consensual deliberations, the High Court ought not to have construed it as violating Article 14 of the Constitution. (e) Article 13 of the Concession Agreement does not lack legal authority, as the rate of fees charged to users was determined by the Fee Review Committee. This determination was made by applying the formula specified in the Concession Agreement and the base rate established by the Steering Committee. The Fee Review Committee itself comprised of representatives from both NOIDA and NTBCL, along with a third party, with each representative duly qualified and possessing adequate experience in the management, operation, and maintenance of bridges. Additionally, the involvement of the Independent Auditor and Engineer ensured a mechanism of checks and balances. There was thus no factual foundation on the basis of which it could be inferred that the authority to levy fees was exclusively delegated to NTBCL. (f) NTBCL was empowered to collect user fees pursuant to Regulation 5(2) of the NOIDA (Levy of Infrastructure Fee) Regulations, 1998 (Regulations). These Regulations were formulated by NOIDA, in exercise of its powers under Section 6A read with Section 19 of the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development Act, 1976 (1976 Act). The collection of user fees commenced only in 2001, after the 1998 Regulations 2012 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports had come into force. That being so, there is no legal or factual foundation to hold that Section 6A of the 1976 Act was applied retroactively. The Regulations were a condition precedent in the Concession Agreement, as outlined in Section 3.1 (a) (iv), which stipulated the formulation of such Regulations to authorise NTBCL to collect fees. There is thus no lack of legal authority, and Article 13 of the Concession Agreement does not suffer from excessive delegation. (g) Article 14 of the Concession Agreement does not contravene public policy, and the High Court erred in applying the Doctrine of Severability. The rationale behind the formulation of the Total Project Cost took into account that NOIDA only contributed Rupees 10 crores towards the project, and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) formula employed is a standard, accepted methodology. Without the safeguard of such a formula, no developer would be willing to undertake substantial investments, particularly given the risk of premature and arbitrary termination of the contract by NOIDA. Furthermore, the return of 20% cannot be deemed arbitrary, as the project had to compete with other infrastructure sectors to secure debt funding and equity investment from the private sector.
