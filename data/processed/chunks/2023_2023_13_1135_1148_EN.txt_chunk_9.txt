In such a situation, we propose to dispose of this appeal by making appropriate directions in exercise of our power to do complete justice between the parties under Article 142 of the Constitution. 21. Accordingly, it is directed that: (i) The third respondent shall be off ered appointment, initially on probation, by the appellant on a post of Postal Assistant (for which he was selected) within a month from date; 114 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. (ii) If no post is vacant, a supernumerary post shall be created; (iii) Subject to satisfactory completion of the period of probation, the third respondent shall be confi rmed in service; (iv) Should service rendered during probation be considered not satisfactory, the appellant will be entitled to proceed in accordance with law; (v) Having not actually worked, the third respondent shall neither be entitled to arrears of salary nor shall he be entitled to claim seniority from the date of appointment of other candidates who participated in the recruitment process of 1995; (vi) Since the third respondent, if confi rmed after successful period of probationary service, would have less than 10 years’ service to his credit and consequently would fall short of qualifying service for pension and other retiral benefi ts, the appellant shall treat him to have been notionally appointed on the date the last of the selected candidates was appointed pursuant to the process of 1995 only for the purpose of release of such benefi ts in accordance with law; and (vii) In such case, his retiral benefi ts shall be computed based on the last pay drawn by him while in service. (viii) These directions will not be applicable to any respondent, other than the third respondent. 22. With the above directions, the appeal stands disposed of together with pending applications, if any. Parties shall, however, bear their own costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals disposed of.
