The appellant responded to the demand on 5 August 2014 and expressed readiness to enter into negotiations with the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board. On 22 September 2014, another notice was issued stating that the Board operates on a no-profi t-no-loss basis, and is liable to pay dues to HESCOM2. The notice stated that the Board’s failure to pay HESCOM its dues would impact upon electricity and water supply. Citing losses caused to the Board, and the audit offi cers’ objections against the non-revision of water bills under government s, the notice requested payment of arrears, in accordance with the revised rates. 7. On 15 October 2014, the appellant requested the respondent to withdraw the notice demanding arrears. In a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India before the High Court, the appellant challenged the notices dated 18 July 2014 and 22 September 2014. 2 Hubli Electricity Supply Company Limited. SOLARIS CHEM TECH INDUSTRIES LTD v. ASSISTANT 467 EXECUTIVE ENGINEER KARNATAKA URBAN WATER SUPPLY AND DRAINAGE BOARD 8. The appellant argued that i) the impugned notices were contrary to clause 4 of the agreements between the parties; ii) the 20 July 2011 Notifi cation, being prior in time to the agreements, was inapplicable and could not be relied on in to enhance the water tariff ; and iii) the enhancement of charges was against the principles of natural justice since the respondent had acted suo motu, without hearing the appellant. 9. The Writ Petition was dismissed by the Single Judge primarily on the ground that Clause 11 of the agreements stipulated that any dispute that would arise between the parties would be resolved fi rstly by mutual discussion and on a failure of the process, by referring the matter to the Chief Engineer, the second respondent, whose decision would be fi nal and binding. The Single Judge also observed that in terms of clause 4 of the agreements, the Board was entitled to increase the rates.
