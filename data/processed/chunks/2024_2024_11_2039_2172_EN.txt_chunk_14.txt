10 Crores to the Assenting Financial 2062 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Creditors as envisaged in the above Clause for BKC Property. Further, then the airport dues and parking charges after the ICD (approx. Rs. 240 Crores as of August 31, 2020) will be paid by the Resolution Applicant upfront in priority over any other payments to the creditors of the Corporate Debtor, subject to a maximum of Rs. 475 Crores. As per the general aviation practice in respect to parking and airport space, as and when the Corporate Debtor will intend to use/ move the aircrafts or use the airport space, such claimants will seek their past dues. Therefore, their payments need to be resolved upfront by pro rata reduction of amounts payable to other creditors, to enable the Corporate Debtor to re-commence its operation, which is why the Resolution Applicant has suggested that their payments be made upfront against the BKC Property. SUCH PAYMENTS WILL BE SETTLED UPFRONT IN FULL IN FIRST 180 DAYS FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE AND WITHOUT ANY CONDITIONS (INCLUDING NOT BEING STAGGERED PAYMENTS SPREAD ACROSS A PERIOD OF TIME) SO THAT FLYING CAN START IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT ANY FUTURE DISPUTES AND CONCERNS WITH SUCH CLAIMANTS FOR PAST DUES. Alternatively, the Resolution Professional can provide the Resolution Applicant with a no-dues certificate from such contingent creditors, in which case, these creditors will be treated in compliance with the provisions of the IBC. The Resolution Applicant states and confirms that this “Proposal for Resolution of outstanding airport and parking dues (approx. Rs. 240 Crores as of August 31, 2020)” which deals with the appropriation of the BKC Property is merely a proposal and not a condition to the implementation of this Resolution Plan and the CoC has the discretion to accept/ reject such proposal. If the above-mentioned proposal is acceptable to the CoC, then it is acceptable to the Resolution Applicant in the manner stated hereinabove. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2063 State Bank of India & Ors. v.
