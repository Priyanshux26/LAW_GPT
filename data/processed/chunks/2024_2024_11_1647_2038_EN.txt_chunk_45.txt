Education is a recognized head of charity. Therefore, religious denominations or sections thereof, which do not fall within the special categories carved out in Articles 29(1) and 30(1), have the right to establish and maintain religious and educational institutions. This would allow members belonging to any religious denomination, including the majority religious community, to set up an educational institution.” 47 The right of citizens of establish and administer educational institutions does not prevent the State from making any law relating to: (a) professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation, trade, business; (b) carrying on by the State or by a corporation owned or controlled by the State, of any trade, business, industry or service, whether to the exclusion, complete or partial of citizens or otherwise.

As opposed to these two provisions, Article 30 does not circumscribe the right on any grounds. This Court has, however, consistently emphasised that the right guaranteed by Article 30 is not absolute. 60. In Rev. Sidhajbhai Sabhai v. State of Bombay,49 a Constitution Bench observed that Article 30 is absolute and cannot be restricted on any grounds such as in Article 19. However, in the very next sentence this Court observed that the right can be restricted on the grounds of efficiency of instruction, discipline, health, sanitation, morality and public .50 It must be noticed that these grounds resemble the grounds for restraint prescribed in Articles 19(6) and 26. 61. The inconsistency of the observations in Rev. Sidhajbahi (supra) was set right in State of Kerala v. Very Rev. Mother Provincial.51 The six-Judge Bench differentiated between restrictions on the autonomy of a minority institution and the standard of education.52 The former is impermissible in view of the protection under Article 30(1). The latter was traced to the regulation of the profession which is covered by Article 19(6). Thus, regulation of a minority educational institution is permissible on the grounds in Article 19(6). However, the regulation must not infringe the minority character of the educational institution. Article 30(1) is absolute in that sense. Justice Khanna’s concurring opinion in St. Xavier’s (supra) also highlighted this point. The learned Judge observed that reasonable restrictions can be imposed to ensure that a minority educational institution is an institution of excellence. The examples given by the Judge included ensuring regular payment of salaries and audit of accounts.53 The distinction between regulation which affects the minority character and a regulation in pursuance of ‘national interest’ was also drawn by the opinion of the majority in TMA Pai (supra).54 National interest was interpreted to include public safety, national 48 PA Inamdar [6] 49 [1962] 3 SCR 837 50 [1962] 3 SCR 837 [849] 51 (1970) 2 SCC 417 52 Ibid [9, 10] 53 St. Xavier’s [91] 54 TMA Pai (supra) [107] 1714 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports security and national integrity, preventing the exploitation of students or the teaching community, and application of general laws such as laws on taxation, sanitation and social welfare.55 The principle that can be inferred from the above precedents is that regulations that may be justified on the grounds stipulated in Articles 19(6) and 26 may fall foul of Article 30 if they infringe the ‘minority character’ of the institution.56 This is the ‘special right’ or ‘protection’ which the Constitution guarantees minority education institutions.
