[Paras 58(a), 58(c), 58(e)] 996 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act, 1959 – Rajasthan Urban Improvement (Amendment) Act, 1987 – s.60A – Land Acquisition Act, 1894: Held: After the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was extended to the State of Rajasthan on 24.09.1984, an amendment in the RUI Act was introduced vide the Amending Act, 1987 which provided for the transitory measures for facilitating the application of the Land Acquisition Act to the State of Rajasthan – The legislature enacted Section 60A with a view to address the pending acquisition proceedings which were initiated under the RUI Act – While sub- section (4) puts an embargo on the challenge to an acquisition on the ground of non-payment of compensation, it is accompanied with a proviso that the compensation must be paid within six months from 01.08.1987. [Paras 67, 68] Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act, 1959 – Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – Whether the compensation was determined and paid lawfully to the respondents: Held: Since the improper service of notice u/s.52(2) invalidates the notification issued u/s.52(1) of the RUI Act for the Moongaksa land, so the discussion hereby is restricted to the acquisition proceedings for the Nangli Kota lands – The OSD passed an u/s.53(3) of the RUI Act for settlement of compensation at Rs. 90,000/- in lieu of the acquisition of the Nangli Kota lands – However, the payment of compensation was delayed – There are atleast two inconsistencies in the payment of compensation to the respondents and the procedure of acquisition of the Nangli Kota lands: (i) As per Section 52(7), the possession of the land being acquired cannot be handed over to the appellant Trust till it deposits the compensation amount determined u/s.53 of the RUI Act – However, in the present case, the possession of the Nangli Kota lands was handed over to the appellant Trust long before it deposited the compensation amount with the reference court; (ii) Even though the parallel litigation on the questions of nature and ownership of the land bearing Survey no. 229 was concluded in 1985, the compensation amount was deposited by the appellant Trust in the reference court only on 31.12.1997 that is after 12 years – The present case is squarely covered by Section 60A(4) as the Nangli Kota lands were already deemed to be vested in the [2024] 12 S.C.R. 997 Urban Improvement Trust v. Smt. Vidhya Devi and Ors. State after the notification under Section 52(1) was published – While sub-section (4) puts an embargo on the challenge to an acquisition on the ground of non-payment of compensation, it is accompanied with a proviso that the compensation must be paid within six months from 01.08.1987 – It is worth noting that neither the State Government nor the appellant Trust deposited the amount towards compensation to be paid to the respondents within a period of 6 months – In fact, there was an inordinate delay of almost 10 years in depositing the compensation amount in the reference court – Further, no reason worth the name has been provided by the State Government and the appellant Trust for such delay – Therefore, in considered view of this Court, the notification under Section 52(1) is liable to be declared invalid on the ground that the compensation was not deposited and paid to the respondents within the timeline specified in Section 60A(4) as well as on the ground that the acquisition process was not fair and in accordance with law – The improper procedure being adopted by the State Government and the appellant Trust when it took possession of the Nangli Kota lands before depositing compensation for the same was in contravention of the mandate of Section 52(7) of the RUI Act.
