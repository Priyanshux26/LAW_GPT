Jain and Anr. : (2011) 12 SCC 713 to submit that unless the statute defined the words and expressions, they ‘have to be construed in the sense in which persons dealing with them understand i.e., as per trade and understanding and usage.’ Further the decision in Commissioner of Central Excise G v. Wockhardt Life Sciences Limited: (2012) 5 SCC 585 has been relied upon to submit that for classifying a taxable commodity, there is no fixed test and the decision on the classification of a particular article would depend on the tangible material or as to how it is comprehended in “common parlance” or “commercial world” or “trade circle”, or in its popular sense.

On the other hand, learned senior counsel for the respondent A Mr. V.V.S. Rao has emphasised on the submissions that AHAHO’s classification has attained finality, having been examined four times; its composition is of four homeopathic medicines in a base oil medium; it has been licensed for manufacture and sale as a homeopathic medicine by the Director, Indian Medicines and Homeopathy, Government of B Andhra Pradesh; it cures/prevents alopecia, dandruff, hair fall, etc., due to its therapeutic and prophylactic properties; and its label indicates the nature of the product as a homeopathic medicine under Schedule K to the Rules of 1945 with ingredients, composition, indications, contra- indications and mode of application. C 9.1. Learned senior counsel would submit that although there were changes in the tariff structure in the year 2012 but then, notwithstanding the amendments, AHAHO has remained classifiable under Chapter 30, as its ingredients or manufacturing process did not undergo any change warranting its classification as a cosmetic under Chapter 33. Elaborating on these aspects, learned senior counsel has submitted that until 2004- D 05 the tariff entry was only 3003 39 for Homeopathic medicines and from 2005-06, 3003.39 was divided into 3003 for wholesale and 3004 for retail sale. Consequent to amendment of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 during the year 2005-06 introducing eight-digit classification system, the product became classifiable under Chapter E heading 3004 90 14 (Medicaments consisting of two or more constituents which have been mixed together for Therapeutic or Prophylactic uses put up in doses or in forms or packings suitable for retail sale). It has been argued with reference to the decisions in BPL Pharmaceuticals v. Collector of Central Excise, Vadodara: 1995 Supp (3) SCC 1 and Commissioner of Central Excise, Nagpur v. Vicco Laboratories: F (2005) 4 SCC 17 that some differences in the tariff entries would not change its character when the product remains the same. According to the learned counsel, insertion of Sub-Headings in Chapter 33 makes no difference as the product in question does not fit into any of the revised descriptions of “Hair oil” in Chapter 33, for AHAHO is clearly covered G by the definition of ‘medicament’. 9.1.1.In regard to the question of re-look at the classification, it has also been submitted that the contention on the part of appellant that the respondent classified the product under 3003 90 14, which provides for medicaments not put up in measured doses or packaging, whereas H 316 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R.
