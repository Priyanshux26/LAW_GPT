In Paul Varghese v. State of Kerala, (2007) 14 SCC 783, this Court again reiterated this provision and held: “As has been rightly held by the High Court in view of what has been stated in Dilawar Singh case [(2005) 12 SCC 709 : (2006) 1 SCC (Cri) 727] the trial court was not justified in holding that Section 319 of the Code has to get preference/primacy over Section 19 of the Act, and that matter stands concluded.” (para 4) 10. The words and phrases used in Section 19(1) of the P.C Act itself make it evident that the provision is mandatory in nature. In Surinderjit Singh Mand v. State of Punjab (2016) 8 SCC 722, although this [2024] 7 S.C.R. 67 The State of Punjab v. Partap Singh Verka court was dealing with the issue of sanction under Section 197 of CrPC but while doing so it referred to various s including the two cases discussed above and emphasized the provision of prior sanction: “The law declared by this Court emerging from the s referred to hereinabove, leaves no room for any doubt that under Section 197 of the Code and/or sanction mandated under a special statute (as postulated under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act) would be a necessary prerequisite before a court of competent jurisdiction takes cognizance of an offence (whether under the Penal Code, or under the special statutory enactment concerned). The procedure for obtaining sanction would be governed by the provisions of the Code and/or as mandated under the special enactment. The words engaged in Section 197 of the Code are, “… no court shall take cognizance of such offence except with previous sanction…”. Likewise sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act provides— “19. Previous sanction necessary for prosecution.—(1) No court shall take cognizance … except with the previous sanction ….” The mandate is clear and unambiguous that a court “shall not” take cognizance without sanction. The same needs no further elaboration. Therefore, a court just cannot take cognizance without sanction by the appropriate authority. Thus viewed, we find no merit in the second contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents that where cognizance is taken under Section 319 of the Code, sanction either under Section 197 of the Code (or under the special enactment concerned) is not a mandatory prerequisite.” 11. It is a well settled position of law that courts cannot take cognizance against any public servant for offences committed under Sections 7,11,13 & 15 of the P.C. Act, even on an application under section 319 of the CrPC, without first following the requirements of Section 68 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 19 of the P.C Act. Here, the correct procedure should have been for the prosecution to obtain sanction under Section 19 of the P.C Act from the appropriate Government, before formally moving an application before the Court under Section 319 of CrPC. In fact, the Trial Court too should have insisted on the prior sanction, which it did not.
