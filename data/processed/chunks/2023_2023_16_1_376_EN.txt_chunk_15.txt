State of Jammu & Kashmir,7 another Constitution Bench held (without considering the earlier decision in Prem Nath Kaul (supra)) that Article 370 is not a temporary provision because: a. Neither the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir nor the President had ever made a declaration that Article 370 ceased to be operative; and * Ed.

A reference to a larger Bench was also sought on the ground that the subsequent decision of the Constitution Bench in Mohd Maqbool Damnoo v. State of Jammu and Kashmir8 ignored the interpretation of Article 370 in Prem Nath Kaul (supra) and, in any event, the does not decide whether Article 370 can continue to operate after the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir was adopted.
