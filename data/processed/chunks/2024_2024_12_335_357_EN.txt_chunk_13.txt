Thus, under Section 304 of the CrPC, it is the duty of the Court to ensure that a legal aid lawyer is appointed to espouse the cause of the accused. 21. Now, we come back to the facts of the case. From the proceedings of the Trial Court, it appears that when the charges were framed on 8th September 2010, and when the plea was recorded, the appellant was not represented by any advocate. Proceedings of 26th February 2011 record that though three witnesses of the prosecution were present, the appellant was not represented by any advocate. Therefore, assurance of the appellant has been recorded that he would call his counsel on the next date. On 11th May 2011, the examination-in-chief of PW-1 was recorded. In the proceedings, the court recorded that the appellant had not engaged any advocate on that day, and he was not desirous of taking legal aid. However, on 8th June 2011, an advocate was appointed to espouse his cause. We find that on 20th July 2012, 4th October 2012, 1st November 2012, 7th November 2012, 9th November 2012 and 23rd November 2012, the advocate appointed as amicus curiae for the appellant was absent. Applications were required to be made by him to recall certain witnesses as the cross-examination was closed due to his absence. Thus, the evidence of more than one prosecution witness was recorded in the absence of the legal aid advocate. On 7th November 2012, another advocate was appointed to espouse the appellant’s cause. We find that a third advocate conducted the cross-examination of PW-8. 22. At the stage of framing the charge, the appellant was not represented by an advocate. From 8th June 2011, the appellant never declined legal aid. We are surprised to note that the examination-in-chief of PW-1 was allowed to be recorded without giving legal aid counsel [2024] 12 S.C.R. 355 Ashok v. State of Uttar Pradesh to the appellant, who was not represented by an advocate. If the examination-in-chief of a prosecution witness is recorded in the absence of the advocate for the accused, a very valuable right of objecting to the questions asked in examination-in-chief is taken away. The accused is also deprived of the right to object to leading questions. It will not be appropriate to comment on the capabilities of the two legal aid lawyers appointed in this case as they are not parties before us. But suffice it to say that the cross-examination of the witnesses was not up to the mark. Some of the crucial questions that normally would have been put in the cross-examination have not been asked. CONCLUDING PART 23. Our conclusions and directions regarding the role of the Public Prosecutor and appointment of legal aid lawyers are as follows: a. It is the duty of the Court to ensure that proper legal aid is provided to an accused; b.
