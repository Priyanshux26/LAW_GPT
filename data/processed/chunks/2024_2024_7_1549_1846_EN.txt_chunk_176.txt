If the aforesaid components are applied to the present case, it is clear that – (i) Section 9 of the MMDR Act, 1957 deals with payment of royalty in respect of any mineral removed or consumed; (ii) by a holder of mining lease who is obliged to pay the royalty; (iii) at the rate specified in the Second Schedule to MMDR Act, 1957; and (iv) a percentage of the average sale price on ad valorem basis. For instance, in respect of Iron Ore : (CLO, lumps, fines and concentrates all grades) fifteen per cent of average sale price on ad valorem basis. Although, Section 9 of the MMDR Act, 1957 is not worded in the manner a charging section in a taxation statute is normally worded, nevertheless, its import must be understood in the sense of it being a taxation provision. For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that royalty is the nature of a tax or an exaction. I now move on to the s of this Court as well as High Courts on the nature of exaction in the form of royalty under the provisions of the MMDR Act, 1957 as the controversy centres around various decisions of this Court and certain High Courts. Hingir-Rampur: 11. In Hingir-Rampur, a Constitution Bench of this Court presided over by P.B. Gajendragadkar, J. was considering the validity of the Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund Act, 1952 (hereinafter referred to as, “Act of 1952”). In December, 1952, the State of Orissa passed 1776 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the Act of 1952. In pursuance of the rule-making power conferred on it by the impugned Act, respondent No.1 purported to make the rules called the Orissa Mining Areas Development Act Rules, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as, “1955 Rules”). The liability for the payment of cess under the impugned Act was notified against the first petitioner’s Rampur colliery therein. Since a demand was made for the payment of cess, there was a challenge made to the same by filing the writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution before this Court. According to the petitioners, cess levied under the impugned Act was not a fee but in substance a levy in the nature of a duty of excise on the coal produced at the first petitioner’s Rampur Colliery, and as such was beyond the legislative competence of the Orissa legislature. Alternatively, it was urged that even if the levy imposed by the impugned Act is a fee relative to Entries 23 and 66 - List II, it would nevertheless be ultra vires having regard to the provisions of Entry 54 - List I read with Central Act 53 of 1948 (MMRD Act, 1948). According to the respondent-the State of Orissa, the levy imposed by the impugned Act was a fee relatable to Entries 23 and 66 - List II and its validity was not affected either by Entry 54 read with Act 53 of 1948 or by Entry 52 read with Act 65 of 1951.
