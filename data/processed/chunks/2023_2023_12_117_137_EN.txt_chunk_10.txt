A perusal of the minutes of the proceedings of the SSFC dated 23.07.2005 would indicate that though the plea of guilty was recorded during the course of the proceedings dated 23.07.2005 but the minutes are not signed by the original petitioner. It is only signed by the Commandant 128 Battalion BSF, namely, Ghanshyam Purswani. 33. Rule 142 of the BSF Rules, 1969 which fall in Chapter XI of the BSF Rules, 1969 deals with the manner in which an SSFC is required to record the plea of guilty. Rule 143 provides for the procedure after the plea of guilty is recorded. The relevant portion of Rule 142 as it stood on the date of the proceeding in question is reproduced below: “142. General plea of “Guilty” or “Not Guilty”.— (1) The accused person’s plea of “Guilty” or “Not Guilty” or if he refuses to plead or does not plead intelligibly either one or the other), a plea of “Not Guilty” shall be recorded on each charge. (2) If an accused person pleads “Guilty”, that plea shall be recorded as the fi nding of the Court; but before it is recorded, the Court shall ascertain that the accused understands the nature of the charge to which he has pleaded guilty and shall inform him of the general eff ect of that plea, and in particular of the meaning of the charge to which he has pleaded guilty, and of the diff erence in procedure which will be made by the plea of guilty and shall advise him to withdraw that plea if it appears from the record or abstract of evidence (if any) or otherwise that the accused ought to plead not guilty.” 34.
