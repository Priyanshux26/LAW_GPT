While making such a prayer, the respondent could not have sought in substance for setting aside of the original dated 23.02.2015 passed in Criminal Miscellaneous No.6/2014 and seeking refund of the maintenance amount which was paid to the appellant pursuant to the said . The respondent could not have also sought the aforesaid prayers: firstly, because he did not participate in the proceedings before the learned Magistrate; secondly, respondent belatedly filed an appeal before the Appellate Court which was dismissed and thirdly, when that appeal was dismissed on the ground of delay, he did not choose to assail the said before a higher forum. 19. In the circumstances, the s of the High Court as well as the first Appellate Court are set aside and the application filed by the respondent is dismissed. However, liberty is reserved to the respondent herein to file a fresh application under Section 25 of the Act, if so advised. If such an application is filed by the respondent, the same shall be considered by the learned Magistrate having regard to the observations made above and on its own merits, which can be relatable to the period subsequent to the date of making the earlier dated 23.02.2015 in the instant case. Any revocation of the dated 23.02.2015 could be with effect from the date of the application, if any, to be made by the respondent herein or as ed by the learned Magistrate. 20. This appeal is allowed and disposed of in the aforesaid terms. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the Case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
