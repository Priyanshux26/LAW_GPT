14. The dates on which the Sectional Officer, Grade-I, were promoted as such either on officiating basis or their promotions were regularlised though as per the dated 31.03.2007 effective from the date when the DPC was held i.e. 16.03.2007 will not have any bearing on the case in hand. Even if the Sectional Officer, Grade-I, are treated to be working from the date they were officiating as such, nothing hinges on that as far as the seniority in the cadre of Junior Engineers is concerned. It is for the reason that the post of Sectional Officer, Grade-I, on which they were working was upgraded to that of Junior Engineer (Class-II Gazetted) vide letter dated 11.10.2007. 15. The pay-scales of Sectional Officer, Grade-I, was ₹4500-7000 and the Junior Engineer was having pay-scales of ₹6000-9750. Meaning thereby that they were working on a lower non-gazetted post. The dispute in the present appeals is only pertaining to the Sectional Officer, Grade-I, whose posts were upgraded on 11.10.2007 and not those whose posts were upgraded prior to the direct recruitment vide Notification dated 01.05.2003. The blatant error committed by the Division Bench of the High Court is that upgraded Sectional Officer, Grade-I, are directed to be given seniority in the cadre of Junior Engineers from a date on which they were not even born in the cadre as it was only after 11.10.2007 upgradation that they became Junior Engineers, which was much after the direct recruitment made on 01.05.2003. 16. For the reasons mentioned above, appeals are allowed. The impugned passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is set aside. The seniority list of the Junior Engineers as circulated on 26.03.2018 is upheld. There shall be no as to costs. Result of the case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
