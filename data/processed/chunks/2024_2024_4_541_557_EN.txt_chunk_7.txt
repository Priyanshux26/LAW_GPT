[2024] 4 S.C.R. 551 PHR Invent Educational Society v. UCO Bank and Others 16. The view taken by this Court has been followed in the case of Agarwal Tracom Private Limited v. Punjab National Bank and Others5. 17. In the case of Authorized Officer, State Bank of Travancore and Another v. Mathew K.C.6, this Court was considering an appeal against an interim passed by the High Court in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution staying further proceedings at the stage of Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act. After considering various s rendered by this Court, the Court observed thus: “16. The writ petition ought not to have been entertained and the interim granted for the mere asking without assigning special reasons, and that too without even granting opportunity to the appellant to contest the maintainability of the writ petition and failure to notice the subsequent developments in the interregnum. The opinion of the Division Bench that the counter-affidavit having subsequently been filed, stay/modification could be sought of the interim cannot be considered sufficient justification to have declined interference.” 18. The same position was again reiterated by this Court in the case of Phoenix ARC Private Limited v. Vishwa Bharati Vidya Mandir and Others7. 19. Again, in the case of Varimadugu OBI Reddy v. B. Sreenivasulu and Others8, after referring to earlier s, this Court observed thus: “34. The of the Tribunal dated 1-8-2019 was an appealable under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, 2002 and in the ordinary course of business, the borrowers/person aggrieved was supposed to avail the statutory remedy of appeal which the law provides under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, 2002. In the absence of efficacious alternative remedy being availed, there was 5 [2017] 11 SCR 164 : (2018) 1 SCC 626 : 2017 INSC 1146 6 [2018] 1 SCR 233 : (2018) 3 SCC 85 : 2018 INSC 71 7 [2022] 1 SCR 950 : (2022) 5 SCC 345 : 2022 INSC 44 8 [2022] 16 SCR 1108 : (2023) 2 SCC 168 : 2022 INSC 1205 552 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports no reasonable justification tendered by the respondent borrowers in approaching the High Court and filing writ application assailing of the Tribunal dated 1-8-2019 under its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution without exhausting the statutory right of appeal available at its command.” 20. It could thus be seen that this Court has strongly deprecated the practice of entertaining writ petitions in such matters. 21. Recently, in the case of Celir LLP (supra), after surveying various s of this Court, the Court observed thus: “101. More than a decade back, this Court had expressed serious concern despite its repeated pronouncements in regard to the High Courts ignoring the availability of statutory remedies under the RDBFI Act and the SARFAESI Act and exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. Even after, the decision of this Court in Satyawati Tondon [United Bank of India v. Satyawati Tondon, (2010) 8 SCC 110 : (2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 260] , it appears that the High Courts have continued to exercise its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 ignoring the statutory remedies under the RDBFI Act and the SARFAESI Act.” 22.
