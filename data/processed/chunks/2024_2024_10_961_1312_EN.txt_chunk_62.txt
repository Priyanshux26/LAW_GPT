The span from 1960 to 1985 was marked by significant political turmoil, civil unrest, and violence in the country’s northeastern parts. 86. Amidst these developments, the NRC was initially prepared exclusively for the state of Assam in 1951. It intended to identify illegal immigrants entering the state from Bangladesh, utilizing data from the 1951 Census. 78 Id, 231. 79 Ministry of External Affairs Annual Report (1943-44), para 15. 1052 [2024] 10 S.C.R.

The following day, on 26.03.1971, Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan, triggering the Bangladesh Liberation War. Following these developments, in December 1971, India joined the war against Pakistan. While immigrants from East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) had been migrating to India since 1948, the wars of 1971 led to an influx of immigrants from Bangladesh into the State of Assam and other Indian states.80 88. Soon, there was anxiety surrounding the issue of electoral rolls in the Northeast region, fueled by concerns revolving around the influx of refugees from erstwhile East Bengal into Assam.81 During this period, the Assam Students Union (AASU) and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP) grew in popularity in the region. Thereafter, in 1979, the draft electoral rolls prepared for the bye-elections in the Lok Sabha Constituency of Mangaldoi in Assam revealed the names of numerous Bangladeshi immigrants. This led the AASU and AAGSP to launch a 6-year-long agitation, now known as the ‘Assam Movement’, fearing that Bangladeshi immigrants would overwhelm the indigenous population of Assam.82 During this period, political tensions escalated, marked by fierce debates and demonstrations concerning the influx of immigrants into Assam. Simultaneously, there were counter-demonstrations in Bengal, expressing solidarity with the Bengali-speaking communities in Assam. These events had a detrimental impact on the economy and trade in Assam, and eventually, in 1981, the President’s rule was imposed in the State. 89. In 1983, after more than a year of President’s rule, the Union of India decided to hold elections, despite a breakdown in negotiations over electoral roll revisions and escalating student-led protests.83 However, these aspirations came to an end with the occurrence of the Nellie Massacre on 18.02.1983, resulting in a devastating 80 AntArA DAttA, Refugees and Bs in South Asia: The Great Exodus of 1971, Routledge, 2015. 81 sAnGeetA BArooAh pishAroty, supra note 75, 27. 82 ArupJyoti sAiKiA, supra note 76, 549. 83 Id, 566.

It is believed that factors contributing to the tragedy included administrative failure, warnings of potential clashes being ignored, and underlying land-related tensions. The Nellie Massacre marked a turning point, transforming the once-peaceful student protests into a violent agitation that garnered national and international attention. Thereafter, in 1984, negotiations between the Centre and AASU stalled, but in January 1985, the then Prime Minister expressed a willingness to resolve Assam’s disputes, leading to the repeal of contentious laws and concessions to calm the agitations.84 90.
