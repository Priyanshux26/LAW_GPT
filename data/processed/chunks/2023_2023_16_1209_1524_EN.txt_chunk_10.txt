[Paras 339, 340] – Held (per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. ): There is a need for a separate anti-discrimination law which inter alia prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation – Such a law should recognize discrimination in an intersectional manner i.e. discrimination must be looked at as a confl uence of factors – as identities and individual instances of oppression that ‘intersect’ and create a distinct form of disadvantage.
