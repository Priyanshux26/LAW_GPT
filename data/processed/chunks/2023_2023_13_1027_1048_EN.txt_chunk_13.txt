Whether the fi re took place by a short circuit or any other reason, as long as insured is not the person who caused the fi re, the Insurance Company cannot escape its liability in terms of the insurance policy. We reject the contention of the Insurance Company that the fi re was ignited by the use of kerosene and hence it is not liable.” 50. Therefore, it was unequivocally declared that the precise cause of a fi re, whether attributed to a short-circuit or any alternative factor, remains immaterial, provided the claimant is not the instigator of the fi re. This case underscored the fundamental principle that an insurance company’s obligation to the insured is of much greater import. The NCDRC’s judicious application of this binding precedent appears to be well-merited. APPLICABILITY OF CUSTOMS DUTY & UNJUST ENRICHMENT 51. In to better appre ciate and understand the argument pertaining to unjust enrichment, the claim statement (11.02.2019) needs to be perused. The claimant as can be noticed, deducted Rs. 2,39,00,664.20 for covered losses and Rs. 19,75,388 for burnt cargo salvage. Notably, the fi nal custom duty amount under the policy was determined as Rs. 2,13,00,061.01. Customs authorities communicated their intent to recover this precise sum, Rs. 2,13,00,061, from the insured through the letters dated 06.02.2019 and 26.10.2020. In response to these communications, the insured submitted an undertaking on 11.08.2015 (Annexure R-4), explicitly stating that they 8 (2020) 3 SCC 455. NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. & ORS. v. M/S. MUDIT 1047 ROADWAYS [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] would not seek any remissions related to customs duty under Sections 22 and 23 of the Customs Act 1962. This action rules out unjust enrichment for the claimants on account of the customs duty. 52. Additionally, the Public Warehouse Licensing Regulations, 2016 mandate that public warehouse licensees must agree to pay all duties, interest, fi nes, and penalties related to stored goods. It was for this reason that the customs duty package policy was also obtained by the insured from the insurance company, so as to indemnify themselves for the goods destroyed or damaged in the warehouse. Needless to say, the said Regulations make the insured duty-bound to pay all such necessary duties, fi nes or penalties. It is in that context that the insured had specifi cally stated that the insurance company may directly remit the said component of duty to the authorities, instead of remitting it to the insured. This would circumvent any unjust enrichment, towards the insured. 53. The key question here is whether the insurance claim should include the customs duty amount of Rs. 2,13,00,061.01/- as claimed by the respondent. The insurance company argued that customs duty should not be included because the Customs Act, 1962 specifi es that only the importer of goods is liable to pay customs duty when they fi le a bill of entry. 54. The insurer anchored their stand on Section 15(1)(b) of the Customs Act stating that duty rates for warehoused goods are determined when a bill of entry for home consumption is fi led, and duty assessment (Section 17) only occurs when a bill of entry (Section 46) is presented.
