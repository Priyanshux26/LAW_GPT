According to the union, the revision proposed would bring up the salaries of skilled grade workmen having 15 years of service (taken as a representative case) to Rs.16,250/- per month as against the salaries of Rs.16,248/- of their Taloja counterparts (as of October 2010). (Comparative chart of Godrej Industries, Deepak Fertilizers and Hikal Ltd. shows their comparable salaries, as of October 2010, of Rs.28,621/-, Rs.20,492/- and Rs.21,419/- respectively.) The monthly and annual burdens on the Respondent employer occasioned by the increase work out to between Rs.6.58 lacs to Rs.14.01 lacs per month, and Rs.78.94 lacs to Rs.1.68 crores, for the particular wage fixation period, namely, from 2008 to 2011.” 7. The employer has assailed the questioning the jurisdiction of the Writ Court in entering into fact-finding exercise while testing legality of an award. The employer’s case argued by Mr. Cama, [2024] 4 S.C.R. 587 The VVF Ltd. Employees Union v. M/S. VVF India Limited & Anr. learned Senior Advocate, sought to fault the approach of the High Court mainly on this ground. He has also argued that the units with which the High Court had made comparison to arrive at its finding were not similarly situated, having regard to their industrial output and financial position. He submits further that the High Court in any event would not sit in appeal over the Tribunal’s award in exercising its jurisdiction of judicial review, primarily applying the scope of the writ of certiorari. He has relied on s of this Court in the cases of Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai and Others [(2003) 6 SCC 675], General Management, Electrical Rengali Hydro Electric Project, Orrisa and Others -vs- Giridhari Sahu and Others [(2019) 10 SCC 695]. In the former , it has been held:- “12. In the exercise of certiorari jurisdiction, the High Court proceeds on an assumption that a court which has jurisdiction over a subject-matter has the jurisdiction to decide wrongly as well as rightly. The High Court would not, therefore, for the purpose of certiorari assign to itself the role of an appellate court and step into reappreciating or evaluating the evidence and substitute its own findings in place of those arrived at by the inferior court.” Broadly the same principle has been laid down in the case of Giridhari Sahu (supra). Mr. Cama has also submitted that in the event the High Court found flaw in the reasoning of the Tribunal on factual basis, instead of undertaking the exercise of revision of pay scale and wages as also other facilities itself in substituting its view in place of the Tribunal’s, the High Court ought to have remanded the matter to the Tribunal itself. 8. The union was represented by Mr. Sanjay Singhvi, learned senior counsel. His submission is that it would be well within the jurisdiction of the High Court to undertake some form of exercise of appreciation of facts and on s he has relied on the of this Court in the cases of M/S Unichem Laboratories Ltd. -vs- Workmen [(1972) 3 SCC 552], Workmen -vs- New Egerton Woollen Mills [(1969) 2 LLJ 782], Shail (SMT) -vs- Manoj Kumar and Others [(2004) 4 SCC 785], IEL Supervisors’ Association and Others -vs- Duncans Industries Ltd. and Another [(2018) 4 SCC 505].
