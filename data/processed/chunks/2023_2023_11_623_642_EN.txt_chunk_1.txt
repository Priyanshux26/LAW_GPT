RAVINDRA BHAT, J. 1. All these appeals involve decision on a common question, with respect to the interpretation of a contract condition, which required the measurement of quantities used for payment for embankment construction with soil or with pond ash. The claimants (hereafter “the contractors”) contended that the measure is one and the same, which is by taking a composite cross section as a whole of the embankment and determining the volume by the average end area method. However, the supervising engineer (hereafter “EE”) adopted a method, whereby the area of the cross section was bifurcated to account for the area occupied by soil and pond ash for the determination of quantum of the embankment in two diff erent items.
