We therefore fi nd that the High Court has erred in directing the State Government to consider the candidates who did not qualify as per the 2012 Service Rules and as per the advertisement based on the Service Rules, particularly when the 2012 Service Rules and the advertisements were not 7 (1994) 4 SCC 391/1994 INSC 196 618 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. under challenge. The High Court, in our view, could not have issued such a mandamus contrary to such Service Rules. 39. That leaves us with the question as to whether the High Court was justifi ed in holding that the 18 months Diploma conducted by NIOS through ODL mode is said to be equivalent to the 2 years Diploma as required under the notifi cations of NCTE dated 23rd August 2010 and 29th July 2011. 40. It will be relevant to refer to the observations of this Court in the case of Devender Bhaskar and Others v. State of Haryana and Others8, which read thus: “21. In Mohammad Shujat Ali v. Union of India, (1975) 3 SCC 76 it was held that the question regarding equivalence of educational qualifi cations is a technical question based on proper assessment and evaluation of the relevant academic standards and practical attainments of such qualifi cations. It was further held that where the decision of the Government is based on the recommendation of an expert body, then the Court, uninformed of relevant data and unaided by technical insights necessary for the purpose of determining equivalence, would not lightly disturb the decision of the Government unless it is based on extraneous or irrelevant considerations or actuated mala fi des or is irrational and perverse or manifestly wrong. 22. In J. Ranga Swamy v. Government of Andhra Pradesh, (1990) 1 SCC 288 this Court held that it is not for the court to consider the relevance of qualifi cation prescribed for various posts. 23. In State of Rajasthan v. Lata Arun, (2002) 6 SCC 252 this Court held that the prescribed eligibility qualifi cation for admission to a course or for recruitment to or promotion in service are matters to be considered by the appropriate authority. It was held thus: “13. From the ratio of the decisions noted above, it is clear that the prescribed eligibility qualifi cation for admission to a course or for recruitment to or promotion in service are matters to be considered by the appropriate authority. It is not for courts to decide whether a particular educational qualifi cation should 8 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1116/2021 INSC 783 JAIVEER SINGH AND OTHERS v. THE STATE OF 619 UTTARAKHAND AND OTHERS [B. R. GAVAI, J.] or should not be accepted as equivalent to the qualifi cation prescribed by the authority.” 24. In Guru Nanak Dev University v. Sanjay Kumar Katwal, (2009) 1 SCC 610 this Court has reiterated that equivalence is a technical academic matter. It cannot be implied or assumed. Any decision of the academic body of the university relating to equivalence should be by a specifi c or resolution, duly published.
