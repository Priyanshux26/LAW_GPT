This amendment removed reference to Article 31 of the Constitution contained in Article 31-C. This was a logical corollary to the omission of [2024] 11 S.C.R. 51 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. Article 31 itself from the Constitution. As Article 31 had been removed from the Constitution, it was no longer necessary that Article 31-C provide legislation with immunity from Article 31 challenges. Thus, after the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, Article 31-C read as follows: “31C. Saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles. – Notwithstanding anything contained in article 13, no law giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing *[all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV the principles specified in clause (b) or clause (c) of article 39] shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article 14, [or] article 19 **[or article 31]; ***[and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy:] Provided that when such law is made by the Legislature of a State, the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration of the President, has received his assent.” *Substitution effected by the Forty Second Amendment **Omission by Forty Forth Amendment *** No longer enforceable after Kesavananda Bharati The amendment to Article 31-C by Section 8 of the Constitution (Forty- fourth Amendment) Act, 1978 and its legal effect are not in dispute. 41. The amendment to Article 31-C by Section 4 of the Forty-Second Amendment was challenged in Minerva Mills v Union of India.37 The petitioners had challenged the Sick Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Act, 1974, and the dated 19 October 1971 nationalising their business. However, at the time of the challenge, the impugned legislation had already been inserted into the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution. Thus, to secure the ultimate relief of 37 [1981] 1 SCR 206 : (1980) 3 SCC 625 : 1980 INSC 142 52 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports reversing the nationalisation, the petitioners in Minerva Mills also challenged the thirty-ninth amendment to the Constitution which had inserted the impugned legislation into the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution and Section 55 of the Forty-Second Amendment which modified Article 368 to exclude constitutional amendments from judicial review. As part of this broader challenge, the petitioners in Minerva Mills also separately challenged Section 4 of the Forty- Second Amendment on the ground that the amendment to Article 31-C violated the basic structure of the Constitution. Parallel to the Constitution Bench proceedings in Minerva Mills, a separate Constitution Bench heard the challenge to the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961 in Waman Rao v Union of India.38 Although Chief Justice YV Chandrachud and Justice PN Bhagwati sat on both Constitution Benches (and indeed Justice Bhagwati authored a common opinion for both cases), the remaining three judges on both Constitution Benches were different and the two cases dealt with separate issues.
