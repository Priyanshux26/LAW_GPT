A fact is said to be proved when, ‘after considering the matters before it, the court either believes it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists’ [Section 3, Evidence Act]. Therefore, the rebuttal does not have to be conclusively established but such evidence must be adduced before the court in support of the defence that the court must either believe the defence to exist or consider its existence to be reasonably probable, the standard of reasonability being that of the ‘prudent man’.” Therefore, it may be said that the liability of the defence in cases under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881 is not that of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. 21. In light of the aforesaid discussion, and as underscored by this Court recently in the decision of Rajesh Jain v. Ajay Singh,7 an accused may establish non-existence of a debt or liability either through conclusive evidence that the concerned cheque was not issued towards the presumed debt or liability, or through adduction of circumstantial evidence vide standard of preponderance of probabilities. 22. Since a presumption only enables the holder to show a prima facie case, it can only survive before a court of law subject to contrary not having been proved to the effect that a cheque or negotiable instrument was not issued for a consideration or for discharge of any existing or future debt or liability. In this backdrop, it is pertinent to make a reference to a decision of 3-Judge Bench in Bir Singh v. Mukesh Kumar,8 which went on to hold that if a signature on a blank cheque stands admitted to having been inscribed voluntarily, it is sufficient to trigger a presumption under Section 139 of the NI Act 1881, even if there is no admission to the effect of execution of entire contents in the cheque. 7 [2023] 13 SCR 788 : (2023) 10 SCC 148. 8 [2019] 2 SCR 24 : (2019) 4 SCC 197. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 135 Sri Dattatraya v. Sharanappa 23. It is therefore apposite to make a reference to the provision of Section 140 of the NI Act 1881, which ruminates mens rea to be immaterial while dealing with proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881. The said legislative wisdom of the Parliament which is imbibed in the bare text of the provision is reproduced as below: “140. Defence which may not be allowed in any prosecution under section 138—It shall not be a defence in a prosecution for an offence under section 138 that the drawer had no reason to believe when he issued the cheque that the cheque may be dishonoured on presentment for the reasons stated in that section.” 24. Through this legal fiction adopted by the legislature vide Amendment Act of 1988 to the NI Act 1881 it has barred the drawer of a cheque, which was dishonoured, to take a defence that at the time of issuance of the cheque in question he or she had no reason to believe that the same will be dishonoured upon being presented by the holder of such a cheque, especially and specifically for the reasons underlined in Section 138 of the NI Act 1881.
