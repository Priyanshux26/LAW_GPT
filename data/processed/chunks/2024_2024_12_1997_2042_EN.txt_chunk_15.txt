In Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary,5 while adjudicating a PIL challenging FIRs filed in the Bofors scandal, this Court elaborated on the rule of locus standi in a PIL. The Court held that there is no rigid litmus test to determine locus standi in a PIL, given the broad contours of such litigations. However, the Court must distinguish between genuine petitions and those filed for private gain or profit. Only individuals acting in good faith and with sufficient interest in the PIL should be permitted to proceed.6 Accordingly, vexatious petitions disguised as PILs, aiming to address personal grievances, deserve rejection at the threshold. 14. In the instant case, Respondent No. 1 is a Society duly registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, with the primary objective of promoting the welfare of NOIDA residents. The society acts as a 1 Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board and others v. T.T. Murali Babu, (2014) 4 SCC 108. 2 Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India, (1979) 3 SCC 489. 3 Balco Employees’ Union v. Union of India, 3 (2002) 2 SCC 333. 4 Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware v. State of Maharashtra, 4 (2005) 1 SCC 590. 5 Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary, (1992) 4 SCC 305. 6 Villianur Iyarkkai Padukappu Maiyam v. Union of India, (2009) 7 SCC 561. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2019 Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd. v. Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association and Others bridge between the residents and public authorities, catering to the former’s needs for essential civic amenities. Given this object, it is clear that Respondent No. 1 approached the High Court in good faith, with a view to safeguard the interests of NOIDA residents, who had been subjected to the levy of toll at the DND Flyway under the guise of user fees by NTBCL. Consequently, we do not find any merit in NTBCL’s contention that Respondent No. 1 lacked locus standi in approaching the High Court. 15. As regard to NTBCL’s contentions pertaining to the alleged collusion between Respondent No. 1 and NOIDA, we find that there is not an iota of material on record to substantiate these sweeping insinuations. G.1.2. Delay and laches 16. NTBCL contended that there was an inordinate delay on the part of the Respondent Association in filing the Writ Petition before the High Court. NTBCL argued that the DND Flyway had been operational since 2001, with the MoU and Concession Agreement having been executed as far back as 1992 and 1997, respectively. Given this, the Writ Petition was filed by Respondent No. 1 only in 2012—nearly 20 years after the execution of the MoU and 15 years after the Concession Agreement. NTBCL asserted that this substantial delay should have been sufficient grounds for the High Court to dismiss the Writ Petition at the outset. 17. This contention, in our considered opinion is wholly misconceived and misdirected. We say so for the reason that firstly, writ proceedings under Articles 32 or 226 are not guided by the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963, but instead, by the Doctrine of Delay and Laches.
