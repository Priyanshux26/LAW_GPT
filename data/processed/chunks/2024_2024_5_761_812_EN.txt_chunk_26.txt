Similar are the observations in Hameedia Hardware Stores v. B. Mohan Lal Sowcar, (1988) 2 SCC 513, 524-25 where it was observed that the court construing a provision should not easily read into it words which have not been expressly enacted but having regard to the context in which a provision appears and the object of the statute in which the said provision is enacted the court should construe it in a harmonious 22 [2010] 8 SCR 1053 : (2010) 8 SCC 24 : 2010 INSC 431 23 [1991] 1 SCR 364 : (1991) 2 SCC 87 : 1991 INSC 36 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 801 Child in Conflict with Law Through his Mother v. The State of Karnataka and Another way to make it meaningful. An attempt must always be made so to reconcile the relevant provisions as to advance the remedy intended by the statute. (See: Sirajul Haq Khan v. Sunni Central Board of Waqf, 1959 SCR 1287, 1299:AIR 1959 SC 198)” (emphasis supplied) 9.25 The issue was thereafter considered by this Court in Rajbir Singh Dalal (Dr.) vs. Chaudhari Devi Lal University, Sirsa and Another24. In the aforesaid case this Court observed as: ‘where the alternative lies between either supplying by implication words which appear to have been accidentally omitted, or adopting a strict construction which leads to absurdity or deprives certain existing words of all meaning, and in this situation it is permissible to supply the words (vide Principles of Statutory Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, 9th Edn., pp.71-76)’. This Court also considered the traditional principles of interpretation known as the ‘Mimansa rules of interpretation’. The issue under consideration in the aforesaid case was regarding requisite academic qualification for appointment to the post of Reader in the University in Public Administration. Applying the tools of interpretation, this Court opined that ‘relevant subject’ should be inserted in the qualification required for the post of Reader after the words ‘at the Masters degree level’ to give the rules a purposive interpretation by filling in the gap. 9.26 The same principles were followed by this Court in Central Bureau of Investigation, Bank Securities and Fraud Cell vs. Ramesh Gelli and Others25. 9.27 In our opinion, the guidance as is evident from sub-section (4) of section 14 of the Act enabling the Chief Judicial Magistrate or Chief Metropolitan Magistrate to extend the period of inquiry as envisaged under Section 14(1), shall apply for extension of period as envisaged in sub-section (3) also. Such an extension can be granted for a limited period for the reasons to be recorded in writing. While considering the prayer for extension of time, 24 [2008] 11 SCR 992 : (2008) 9 SCC 284 : 2008 INSC 913 25 [2016] 1 SCR 762 : (2016) 3 SCC 788 : 2016 INSC 134 802 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the delay in receipt of opinion of the experts shall be a relevant factor. This shall be in the spirit of the Act and giving the same a purposive meaning.
