The allegations of non-compliance with the of the three- Judge Bench were dealt with by the Coordinate Bench in the aforesaid passed on 25.02.2022. It was, inter-alia, observed and directed in the said :- “9. Firstly, what we have to consider is only the effect of “change in law”, which as per RERC, API’EL and this Court would be the actual landed cost of alternate coal/ imported coal minus the landed cost of domestic linkage coal. The question of any claim which the respondents may have against the petitioner, is not an issue before us. As per the principle laid down by RERC and affirmed up till this Court, the petitioner has claimed an amount of Rs.5344. 75 crores up to March, 2021. The said principle having been affirmed by the APTEL as well as by this Court and even in Review Petition, cannot be reopened now. It cannot be disputed that after March, 2021 also, the petitioner would be entitled 1034 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports to payment on the basis of the same calculation, which up to November, 2021 comes to Rs.130.69 crores. As such, the due amount up to November 2021 would be Rs.5344. 75 + Rs.130.69 = 54 75.44 crores. Out of this amount of Rs.54 75.44 crores, the petitioner has been paid a sum of Rs.2426.81 crores in terms of the interim passed by this Court. Hence, as per the petitioner, the balance amount of Rs.3048.63 crores would remain due to be paid up to November, 2021. The interest at the maximum rate of 9% per annum, as capped by this Court vide its and dated 31.08.2020, is to be applied on the said amount, from the date the amount became due, till the date of actual payment. The further claim of late payment surcharge, amounting to Rs.2477.70 crores, as per the petitioner, would be a subject matter which the petitioner, if so advised, can claim before the appropriate forum, as the same is not the subject in question in the present proceedings, regarding which no directions have also been issued by this Court. 10. As such, considering the totality of facts and circumstances of this case, prima face we are of the opinion that the respondents are liable for contempt for not complying this Court’s dated 31.08.2020. We, thus, direct the respondents to pay to the petitioner, the principal amount (as per the terms/norms laid down in the of this Court dated 31.08.2020) minus Rs.2426.81 crores deposited by the respondents in terms of the interim dated 29.10.2018 (which, as per the petitioner, the balance payable amount would be Rs.3048.63 crores) along with interest as per the applicable SBAR for the relevant years, which should not exceed 9% per annum (to be compounded annually), from the date the amount became due till the date of actual payment, within four weeks from today, failing which the respondents shall appear before this Court in person, on the next date, so as to enable this Court to frame charges.” 7.
