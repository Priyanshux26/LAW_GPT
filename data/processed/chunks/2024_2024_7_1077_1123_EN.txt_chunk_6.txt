Consequently, the Tahsildar was directed to mutate the name of the first respondent in terms of the final decree, and was also sentenced to simple imprisonment for a term of two months, together with a fine of Rs 1500/- (Rupees fifteen hundred only). XIV. This decision of the Single Judge was challenged by the appellant in two separate appeals – (i) Contempt Appeal 33/2017,9 presented against the punishment imposed on the appellant and (ii) Letters Patent Appeal 01/2018,10 presented against the direction for mutation of the name of the first respondent in the revenue records qua the decretal property. XV. A Division Bench of the High Court,11 vide a detailed and dated 16th August, 2018, allowed both the appeals and set aside the under challenge for two primary reasons – (i) the contempt petition was barred by limitation, the failure of the Tahsildar to effect the mutation constituting a single act and not a continuing wrong; and (ii) the preliminary decree recorded that the civil suit was withdrawn as against the State Government. Thus, there did not exist any decree which could have been executed against the Government by the civil court. Thus, as a legal and logical corollary, the State could not be bound to effect mutation in the revenue records in terms of a decree which was unenforceable against it. Consequently, the first respondent’s attempt to seek a direction of mutation against the State, on the strength of such a decree, was held to be fraudulent in nature. XVI. Challenge laid by the first respondent to the and dated 16th August, 2018 by presenting special leave petitions12 before this Court was not entertained resulting in its dismissal 9 contempt appeal, hereafter 10 letters patent appeal, hereafter 11 Division Bench (original), hereafter 12 SLP (C) 24646-24647/2018 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1087 S. Tirupathi Rao v. M. Lingamaiah & Ors. vide dated 29th October, 2018. A petition seeking review13 of such of dismissal was also dismissed by this Court vide dated 08th January, 2019. XVII. This Court having spurned his aforesaid challenges, the first respondent knocked the doors of the High Court once again by filing review petitions against the common and dated 16th August, 2018 (allowing the letters patent appeal and the contempt appeal). XVIII. As noted at the beginning of this , vide the impugned , another Division Bench14 of the High Court allowed the review petitions. IMPUGNED 4. The Division Bench (review) noted at the outset that the merits of the matter need not be looked into, and then went on to undertake an exhaustive examination of precisely the same. 4.1 The High Court adversely observed that the State had not yet obtained any decree against the first respondent or his predecessors-in-interest to the effect that the subject land belonged to it. The State was noted to have filed OSA (Sr) No. 2116/2011, challenging the final decree proceedings dated 26th December, 2003 but the same stood dismissed vide dated 24th August, 2011, with an observation that the State ought to initiate separate proceedings in accordance with law.
