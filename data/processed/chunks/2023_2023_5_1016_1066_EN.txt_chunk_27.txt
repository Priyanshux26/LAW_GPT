62. In a line of precedent of this Court, there has been a discussion on whether a separate hearing on the issue of sentence is mandatory B after recording the conviction of an accused for an offence punishable by death. Section 235 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 197317 states thus: 235. of acquittal or conviction.— (1) After hearing arguments and points of law (if any), the Judge C shall give a in the case. (2) If the accused is convicted, the Judge shall, unless he proceeds in accordance with the provisions of Section 360, hear the accused on the question of sentence, and then pass sentence on him according to law. D 63. In Santa Singh v State of Punjab18, a two judge Bench of this Court highlighted the requirement of having a separate sentencing hearing in view of Section 235(2) of the CrPC and noted that the stage of sentencing was as important a stage in the process of administering criminal justice as the adjudication of guilt. E 64. The of the majority in the Constitution Bench decision in Bachan Singh v State of Punjab19 reiterated the importance of a sentencing hearing. The Court noted that: 151. Section 354(3) of the CrPC, 1973, marks a significant shift in the legislative policy underlying the Code of 1898, as in force F immediately before April 1, 1974, according to which both the alternative sentences of death or imprisonment for life provided for murder and for certain other capital offences under the Penal Code, were normal sentences. Now according to this changed legislative policy which is patent on the face of Section 354(3), G the normal punishment for murder and six other capital offences under the Penal Code, is imprisonment for life (or imprisonment for a term of years) and death penalty is an exception. 17 “CrPC” 18 1976 (4) SCC 190 H 19 1980 (2) SCC 684 SUNDAR @ SUNDARRAJAN v. STATE BY INSPECTOR OF 1053 POLICE [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] […] A 152. In the context, we may also notice Section 235(2) of the Code of 1973, because it makes not only explicit, what according to the decision in Jagmohan’s case was implicit in the scheme of the Code, but also bifurcates the trial by providing for two hearings, one at the pre-conviction stage and another at B the pre-sentence stage. […] 163. […] Now, Section 235(2) provides for a bifurcated trial and specifically gives the accused person a right of pre- sentence hearing, at which stage, he can bring on record C material or evidence, which may not be strictly relevant to or connected with the particular crime under inquiry, but nevertheless, have, consistently with the policy underlined in Section 354(3) a bearing on the choice of sentence. The present legislative policy discernible from Section 235(2) read with Section 354(3) is that in fixing the degree of punishment or making the D choice of sentence for various offences, including one under Section 302, Penal Code, the Court should not confine its consideration “principally” or merely to the circumstances connected with particular crime, but also give due consideration to the circumstances of the criminal.
