Similar issue was considered by a Full Bench of Allahabad High Court in Ram Karan Singh v. Nakchhad Ahir8. In the aforesaid case, a suit for recovery of possession and mesne profi ts was fi led on 24.08.1925. In the suit, the plaintiff claimed mesne profi ts upto the date of fi ling of the suit.

The claim for mesne profi ts can only be brought in respect of profi ts within three years of the institution of the suit and the date of the cause of action for mesne profi ts would in many cases be not identical with the original date of the cause of action for the recovery of possession.
