In consequence, Schedule 1, pertaining to the Trust, was directed to be amended after expiry of the appeal period. However, no appeal was filed against this within such period. 10. Thereafter, Jagdishchandra appointed four other persons, viz., Kedar Patil, Shailesh Patil, Vishwajit Virajkumar Nandimath and Balasaheb Yelshetty as Trustees, by co-opting them on 28.03.2017. He filed Change Report No. 1177 of 2017 to record their names in the register maintained under Section 17 of the Act of 1950. 11. While so, five persons, viz., Subhash Mallikarjun Birajdar, Abhijeet Prakash Birajdar, Kalyani Mallappa Birajdar, Sachin Shivanand Birajdar and Kedar Shivanna Birajdar, claiming to be the devotees of Shri Mallikarjun Temple at Shelgi filed an application under Section 70A of the Act of 1950 before the Joint Charity Commissioner, Pune, against the dated 15.03.2016 passed by the Deputy 68 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Charity Commissioner, Solapur, accepting Change Report No. 899 of 2015. The same was taken on file as Revision Application No. 61 of 2017. Therein, these five devotees questioned the eligibility of Jagdishchandra to be the Vahiwatdar of the subject Trust, alleging that he had ‘unlawfully, without having any kind of relation, by cheating and misleading villagers, society as well as the Hon’ble Court, filed the Change Report No. 899 of 2015 and obtained approval’. They further alleged that the Deputy Charity Commissioner had not made a proper inquiry on the Change Report. According to them, after the death of Ashok Mallikarjun Patil, the functioning of the Trust was being handled by the villagers and they had been looking after the worship and other programs and Jagdishchandra was just overseeing the Temple. They, however, did not make the delay on his part a ground of challenge. 12. However, Jagdishchandra filed an application in the revision pointing out that he had filed a delay condonation application in relation to the filing of Change Report No. 899 of 2015 and that pendency of the same may adversely affect his legal rights. He prayed that a finding be called for from the Deputy Charity Commissioner, Solapur, about the said application pending the revision. By dated 29.01.2019, the Joint Charity Commissioner, Pune, held that the Change Report had been accepted, which meant that the delay stood condoned, and it was not necessary to call for a finding on the delay condonation application. 13. Thereafter, the Joint Charity Commissioner, Pune, dismissed Revision Application No. 61 of 2017 filed by the five devotees, vide dated 09.07.2019. Therein, the Joint Charity Commissioner observed that Jagdishchandra was the son of Mallikarjun Mahalingappa Patil, at whose behest the Public Trust had been registered. He noted that Jagdishchandra was the third son and that the other four sons, including Satish, who was older than Jagdishchandra, had filed affidavits stating that they consented to his appointment as Trustee. The Joint Charity Commissioner also noted that the revision applicants were not members of the family of Mallikarjun Mahalingappa Patil and that their other revision, being Revision Application No. 60 of 2017, challenging the dated 17.06.1954 passed in Inquiry Application No.
