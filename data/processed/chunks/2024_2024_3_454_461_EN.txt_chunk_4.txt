12. Even if, for the sake of argument, it is to be accepted that the proviso to Section 3 would be applicable in respect of supplies or payments due or payable after 10.08.1998, the issue with regard to calculation and computation of interest requires examination and determination of the day of acceptance or the day of deemed acceptance, as interest would be payable only after a period of 120 days from such date. 13. In these circumstances and in view of the aforesaid position, we do not find any good ground and reason to interfere with the conclusion in the impugned passed by the Division Bench of the High Court, setting aside the arbitral award dated 30.06.2003. We would, however, record that the award having been set aside, the provisions of Section 43(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 would come into operation and would accordingly apply. 14. We clarify that MSEB need not be a party to the proceedings, if any, which may be initiated by SSPL or MSSIDCL. However, any adjudication for payment of interest under Sections 3 to 5 of 1993 Act, including the question relating to application of the proviso, would require ascertainment of the appointed date, the date of acceptance or the deemed date of acceptance. To this limited extent, ascertainment of facts with reference to the consignee – MSEB, to whom the goods were supplied by SSPL, is required. By way of Act No.23 of 1998, which came in effect from 10.08.1998, amending clause 2(f), MSSIDCL is to be treated or deemed to be a supplier to MSEB. However, this will not deviate from the fact that MSSIDCL was the buyer under the supply/purchase dated 30.03.1995 issued by MSSIDCL to SSPL. Equally, the G.O. 2(1)/A/93-SSI Bd. and Policy dated 05.05.1993 issued by the Ministry of Industry, Department of SSI, Agro and Rural Industries, Office of the Development Commissioner (Small Scale Industries), has an effect of treating MSSIDCL as a supplier for the purpose of claiming interest from the buyer, that is MSEB, with whom they have entered into a contract for the purpose of the 1993 Act. The liability to pay and the privity of contract in terms of the supply/purchase dated 30.03.1995 is between MSSIDCL and SSPL. The contractual [2024] 3 S.C.R. 461 Snehadeep Structures Pvt. Limited v. Maharashtra Small Scale Industries Development Corporation Ltd. relationship, rights and obligations inter se MSSIDCL and SSPL do not undergo any change. 15. On the question of liability under Section 5 as well, there is a dispute as it is accepted that the principal amount has been paid. A question would arise whether under Section 5, interest as compounded is to be treated as a principal amount. This aspect has not been considered in the award passed by the sole arbitrator, which has awarded compound interest on the interest element with monthly rest at 1.5 times the Prime Lending Rate charged by the State Bank of India. 16. We are informed that certain payments were made by MSSIDCL and a substantial amount of over Rs.1.30 crores has been paid to/withdrawn by SSPL.
