37. At this juncture, even if we assume the veracity of the claim that the items sold to Manoj were indeed stolen articles, it would not be suffi cient to attract Section 411, IPC; what was further necessary to be proved is continued retention of such articles with a dishonest intent and knowledge or belief that the items were stolen. No evidence worthy of consideration was adduced by the prosecution to prove that Manoj had retained the articles 9 (1997) 11 SCC 720 262 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. either with dishonest intent and with knowledge or belief of the same being stolen property. Conviction of Kallu under Section 120-B, IPC 38. It is intriguing that among all fi ve accused persons, only Kallu has been convicted for criminal conspiracy under Section 120-B, IPC. At this stage, we cannot help but wonder: can a single individual conspire with oneself? We cannot but disagree. It logically follows that one person alone can never be held guilty of criminal conspiracy because one cannot conspire with oneself. As per Black’s Law Dictionary (8th Edn), ‘conspiracy’ is an “agreement by two or more persons to commit an unlawful act, coupled with an intent to achieve the agreement’s objective, and action or conduct that furthers the agreement”. The wordings of Section 120-A, IPC make it abundantly clear—the off ence of criminal conspiracy is committed only when two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done an illegal act or legal act by illegal means. The position in English law too is well-settled. In The King vs. Plummer10, the King’s Bench, speaking through Lord Justice Bruce, held: It logically follows from the nature of the off ence of conspiracy that, where two or more persons are charged in the same indictment with conspiracy with one another, and the indictment contains no charge of their conspiring with other persons not named in the indictment, then, if all but one of the persons named in the indictment are acquitted, no valid can be passed upon the one remaining person. (page 343) 39. In I.G. Singleton v. King-Emperor11, the Calcutta High Court further clarifi ed the law related to criminal conspiracy: The rule of English law that is now well settled is that where two persons are indicted for conspiring together and they are tried together, both must be acquitted, or both convicted. (page 265) 40. The decision of this Court in Topandas (supra) affi rmed the aforesaid position and held: 14. … on the charge as it was framed against the Accused 1, 2, 3 and 4 in this case, the Accused 1 could not be convicted of the off ence 10 (1902) 2 KB 339 11 (1924-25) 29 CWN 260: AIR 1925 Cal 501 MANOJ KUMAR SONI v. 263 THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code when his alleged co- conspirators Accused 2, 3 and 4 were acquitted of that off ence. 41. Having regard to the position of law as aforesaid, the conviction of Kallu under Section 120-B, IPC stands completely vitiated because of the simple reason that one cannot alone conspire.
