However, now, considering the fact of mental disability to be suffered by appellant, who is now around 40 years old and the age of the mother who is above 60 years old, and will be appellant’s primary caretaker, we are of the opinion that a reasonable amount for future attendant charges should also be awarded to the appellant. 10 [2017] SCR 100 : (2017) 16 SCC 680 : 2017 INSC 1068 928 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 17. In this regard, we have perused the statement of the appellant’s mother (PW-3). As per her statement, initially they had engaged an attendant at ₹6,000 per month. However, he had left his services about a month before the mother was cross-examined on 23rd September, 2016. Further, the appellant’s father works as a priest and have a meagre monthly income. Thus, it is the appellant’s mother and other family members who are taking care of him. Considering the aforesaid facts, in our opinion, a lump sum amount of ₹1,00,000/- is reasonable and deserves to be awarded to the appellant on account of future attendant charges. 18. In addition to the above, appellant is also entitled to compensation on account of loss of marriage prospects. A perusal of the impugned award of the Tribunal and the High Court shows that nothing has been awarded to the appellant under this head. In our opinion, considering the law laid down by this Court on this issue, the appellant deserves to be awarded a sum of ₹1,00,000/- on this account. 19. Further, in our view, a compensation of ₹50,000/- on account of pain and suffering is also on lower side and the same deserves to be enhanced to ₹1,00,000/-. It is for the reason that on account of the injury suffered, the appellant has become mentally unstable, having disability of 60%, which indeed has resulted in 100% functional disability. 20. An argument is raised by learned counsel for the insurance company that the appellant has initially claimed a sum of ₹30,00,000/- and since the same having been awarded to him by the High Court, no further enhancement is possible. We cannot accept this argument and it is duly rejected. It is a settled proportion of law, that the amount of compensation claimed is not a bar for the Tribunal and the High Court to award more than what is claimed, provided it is found to be just and reasonable. It is the duty of the Court to assess fair compensation. Rough calculation made by the claimant is not a bar or the upper limit. Reference in this regard can be made to the of this Court in the case of Meena Devi vs. Nunu Chand Mahto.11 11 [2022] 18 SCR 449 : (2023) 1 SCC 204 : 2022 INSC 1080 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 929 Chandramani Nanda v. Sarat Chandra Swain and Another 21. For the reasons mentioned above, this appeal is allowed and the compensation awarded to the appellant is assessed in the following terms: Head Compensation (in ₹) Annual Income 2,00,000 Annual Income after Future Prospects 2,80,000 @ 40% Loss of future income 44,80,000 (₹2,80,000 x 16 x 100% disability) Medical Expenditure 3,51,153 Future Attendant Cost 1,00,000 Loss of marriage prospects 1,00,000 Pain and suffering 1,00,000 Future medical expenses 1,00,000 Total 52,31,153 22.
