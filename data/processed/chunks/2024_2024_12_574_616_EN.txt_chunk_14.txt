48. Accordingly, if there is undue, unexplained and inordinate delay in execution due to pendency of mercy petitions or the executive as well as the constitutional authorities have failed to take note of/consider the relevant aspects, this Court is well within its powers under Article 32 to hear the grievance of the convict and 594 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports commute thone death sentence into life imprisonment this ground alone however, only after satisfying that the delay was not caused at the instance of the accused himself. To this extent, the jurisprudence has developed in the light of the mandate given in our Constitution as well as various Universal Declarations and directions issued by the United Nations. 49. The procedure prescribed by law, which deprives a person of his life and liberty must be just, fair and reasonable and such procedure mandates humane conditions of detention preventive or punitive. In this line, although the petitioners were sentenced to death based on the procedure established by law, the inexplicable delay on account of executive is inexcusable. Since it is well established that Article 21 of the Constitution does not end with the pronouncement of sentence but extends to the stage of execution of that sentence, as already asserted, prolonged delay in execution of sentence of death has a dehumanising effect on the accused. Delay caused by circumstances beyond the prisoners’ control mandates commutation of death sentence. In fact, in Vatheeswaran [T.V.Vatheeswaran v. State of T.N. (1983) 2 SCC 68 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 342] , particularly, in para 10, it was elaborated where amongst other authorities, the minority view of Lords Scarman and Brightman in the 1982 Privy Council case of Riley v. Attorney General of Jamaica [Riley v. Attorney General of Jamaica (1983) 1 AC 719 : (1982) 3 WLR 557 : (1982) 3 All ER 469 : 1982 Cri Law Review 679 (PC)], by quoting: (Vatheeswaran case [T.V.Vatheeswaran v. State of T.N. (1983) 2 SCC 68 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 342] , SCC p. 72) “10. ‘… Sentence of death is one thing: sentence of death followed by lengthy imprisonment prior to execution is another.’” (Riley case [Riley v. Attorney General of Jamaica, (1983) 1 AC 719 : (1982) 3 WLR 557 : (1982) 3 All ER 469 : 1982 Cri Law Review 679 (PC)] , AC p. 735 B) (emphasis supplied) [2024] 12 S.C.R. 595 State of Maharashtra & Ors. v. Pradeep Yashwant Kokade & Anr. The appropriate relief in cases where the execution of death sentence is delayed, the Court held, is to vacate the sentence of death. In para 13, the Court made it clear that Articles 14, 19 and 21 supplement one another and the right which was spelled out from the Constitution was a substantive right of the convict and not merely a matter of procedure established by law. This was the consequence of the in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) 1 SCC 248] which made the content of Article 21 substantive as distinguished from merely procedural.” (emphasis added) In paragraph 244, the Bench proceeded to hold thus: “244.
