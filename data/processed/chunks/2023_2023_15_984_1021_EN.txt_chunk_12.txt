67-68, para 49) “49. … In our considered view, the legal position expounded by this Court in a large number of s including New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Shanti Misra [(1975) 2 SCC 840]; SEBI v. Ajay Agarwal [(2010) 3 SCC 765 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 491] and Ramesh Kumar Soni v. State of M.P. [(2013) 14 SCC 696 : (2014) 4 SCC (Cri) 340] , is clear and unambiguous, namely, that procedural amendments are presumed to be retrospective in nature, unless the amending statute expressly or impliedly provides otherwise. And also, that generally change of “forum” of trial is procedural, and normally following the above proposition, it is presumed to be retrospective in nature unless the amending statute provides otherwise. This determination emerges from the decision of this Court in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur v. State of Maharashtra [(1994) 4 SCC 602 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 1087]; Ranbir Yadav v. State of Bihar [(1995) 4 SCC 392 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 728] and Kamlesh Kumar v. State of Jharkhand [(2013) 15 SCC 460 : (2014) 6 SCC (Cri) 489], as well as, a number of further s noted above.” 59. The above observations indicate the clear view of this Court that: 59.1. In the absence of a contrary intent express or implied, procedural amendments are presumed to be retrospective. 59.2. A change in the forum of a trial is a procedural matter. MUMTAZ YARUD DOWLA WAKF v. M/S BADAM 1001 BALAKRISHNA HOTEL PVT. LTD. & ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] 59.3. Since a change of forum is procedural, a statute which brings about the change is presumed to be retrospective in the absence of a contrary intent. ××××× C.23. Conclusion on the position of law 72. In considering the myriad precedents that have interpreted the impact of a change in forum on pending proceedings and retrospectivity—a clear position of law has emerged : a change in forum lies in the realm of procedure. Accordingly, in compliance with the tenets of statutory interpretation applicable to procedural law, amendments on matters of procedure are retrospective, unless a contrary intention emerges from the statute. This position emerges from the decisions in New India Assurance [New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Shanti Misra, (1975) 2 SCC 840], Maria Cristina [Maria Cristina De Souza Sodder v. Amria Zurana Pereira Pinto, (1979) 1 SCC 92], Hitendra Vishnu Thakur [Hitendra Vishnu Thakur v. State of Maharashtra, (1994) 4 SCC 602 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 1087], Ramesh Kumar Soni [Ramesh Kumar Soni v. State of M.P., (2013) 14 SCC 696 : (2014) 4 SCC (Cri) 340] and Sudhir G. Angur [Sudhir G. Angur v. M. Sanjeev, (2006) 1 SCC 141]. More recently, this position has been noted in a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Manish Kumar v. Union of India [(2021) 5 SCC 1 : (2021) 3 SCC (Civ) 50]. However, there was a deviation by a two- Judge Bench decision of this Court in Dhadi Sahu [CIT v. Dhadi Sahu, 1994 Supp (1) SCC 257], which overlooked the decision of a larger three-Judge Bench in New India Assurance [New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Shanti Misra, (1975) 2 SCC 840] and of a coordinate two-Judge Bench in Maria Cristina [Maria Cristina De Souza Sodder v. Amria Zurana Pereira Pinto, (1979) 1 SCC 92].
