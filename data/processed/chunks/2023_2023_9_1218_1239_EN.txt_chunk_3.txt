It was further alleged that the offences pleaded against the appellant were not criminal and other allegations with respect to publication and font size etc. were not substantial and on D the other hand, there was substantial compliance with the law and the guidelines. The election petitioner/respondent resisted the application after which the appellant filed a rejoinder. 4. During the course of the proceedings, on 15.11.2021, the appellant filed a memo2 which stated that he had obtained certified copies of the sheet dated 28.06.2013; regarding seizure of property in CF E 97/2013, from the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Garhwa and related criminal case. Translations of those into English were made available. These documents were filed in the election proceedings to contest the election petitioner’s assertion. The appellant also applied under Section 340 of the Criminal Procedure Code (hereafter “CrPC”) read with Section F 195 of the CrPC, broadly alleging that the documents produced as true copies along with the election petition and the averments made were false, calling for appropriate criminal proceedings to be drawn up against the respondent. 5.

In the present case, the High Court noticed the contentions of the parties as well as the pleadings and was of the opinion that having regard to the terms of VII Rule 11 CPC, only the averments in B the petition and the accompanying documents could be considered and not any other materials brought on record during the course of the proceedings. The court was of the opinion that taking in the overall conspectus of the facts available on the record did not lead to a compelling reason for rejecting the election petition. Accordingly, the appellant’s C application was dismissed, and the contentions were kept open to be agitated during the trial. 7. The appellant’s main contention was that though the appellant had urged several grounds with respect to its explanation for the alleged non-compliance of what were termed by the election petitioner as D mandatory requirements, it was also alleged that Section 81(3) had not been complied with. However, during the hearing, the arguments on behalf of the appellant, by Mr. C.S. Sundaram, Senior Advocate, were confined to submissions to the aspect regarding non-disclosure of criminal cases. The first related to a criminal case pending before the CJM, Garhwa bearing CR 96P; case No. CF 97/13 dated 20.03.2013 in Form E 26, i.e., the election affidavit.
