The couple subsequently moved to Bengaluru, Karnataka, where they resided together. However, the respondent alleged that the appellant treated him with cruelty during this period. Eventually, the petition for restitution of conjugal rights was dismissed for default. The appellant once again left the matrimonial home allegedly without informing the respondent and returned to her parental home. The respondent claimed that this desertion, combined with the mental anguish caused by her absence during the demise of his father, amounted to cruelty. Consequently, the respondent filed a divorce petition in 2010 on the grounds of cruelty. 4. The appellant denied the allegations in the petition for dissolution of marriage and contended that the respondent was at fault for failing to bring her back to the matrimonial home. She filed a counterclaim for restitution of conjugal rights in her response before the Trial Court, expressing her willingness to reconcile. Both parties presented their cases: the respondent examined himself as PW1 and submitted twelve documents as evidence, while the appellant testified as RW1 but did not produce any documentary evidence. After evaluating the evidence, the Trial Court dismissed the respondent’s divorce petition, holding that he has failed to establish that the appellant’s conduct amounted to mental cruelty. 5. The respondent’s appeal against this decision was also dismissed by the First Appellate Court. The First Appellate Court concurred with the Trial Court’s findings, observing that the respondent had not proven that the appellant had voluntarily deserted him without cause or inflicted mental cruelty. Instead, the First Appellate Court noted that the appellant had expressed a desire for reconciliation. 6. Challenging the findings and the of the First Appellate Court, the respondent approached the High Court. The High Court in its reviewed the contentions of both the parties, as well as the rulings of the Courts below. The respondent’ primary contention was that the appellant had subjected him to cruelty, both mental and physical. He argued that her actions, including filing false cases against him and deserting the matrimonial home, amounted to [2024] 12 S.C.R. 759 Amutha v. A.R. Subramanian mental cruelty. He further claimed that despite his repeated attempts to reconcile, the appellant remained adamant and disinterested in reuniting, which led to the breakdown of the marriage. The respondent emphasized that their separation, which had lasted for over ten years, demonstrated the irretrievable breakdown of the marital relationship. 7. On the other hand, the appellant contended that the Courts below had correctly appreciated the evidence and rightly dismissed the respondent’s claims for divorce. Her counsel before the High Court argued that the alleged acts of cruelty were not substantiated with sufficient evidence and that trivial disputes or normal wear and tear of married life could not constitute grounds for divorce. The appellant maintained that the burden of proof rested on the respondent to demonstrate acts of cruelty, which he failed to do. Furthermore, the appellant contended that there was no evidence to suggest she had no interest in continuing the marital relationship, and the claims of cruelty were unsubstantiated.
