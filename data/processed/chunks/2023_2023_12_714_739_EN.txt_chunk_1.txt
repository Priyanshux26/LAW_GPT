22(1) of the Constitution and s.19(1) of the Act of 2002 – Thus, there is no hesitation in holding that their arrest was not in keeping with the provisions of s.19(1) of the Act of 2002. [Paras 18, 19, 25, 35] Constitution of India – Art. 22 – Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Informing the arrested person of the grounds for his/her arrest – Importance of: Held: Article 22(1) of the Constitution provides, inter alia, that no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest – It may be noted that s.45 of the Act of 2002 enables the person arrested u/s. 19 thereof to seek release on bail but it postulates that unless the twin conditions prescribed thereunder are satisfi ed, such a person would not be entitled to grant of bail – The twin conditions set out in the provision are that, fi rstly, the Court must be satisfi ed, after giving an opportunity to the public prosecutor to oppose the application for release, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the arrested person is not guilty of the off ence and, secondly, that he is not likely to commit any off ence while on bail – To meet this requirement, it would be essential for the arrested person to be aware of the grounds on which the authorized offi cer arrested him/her u/s.19 and the basis for the offi cer’s ‘reason to believe’ that he/she is guilty of an off ence punishable 716 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. under the Act of 2002 – It is only if the arrested person has knowledge of these facts that he/she would be in a position to plead and prove before the Special Court that there are grounds to believe that he/she is not guilty of such off ence, so as to avail the relief of bail – Therefore, communication of the grounds of arrest, as mandated by Art. 22(1) of the Constitution and s.19 of the Act of 2002, is meant to serve this higher purpose and must be given due importance.
