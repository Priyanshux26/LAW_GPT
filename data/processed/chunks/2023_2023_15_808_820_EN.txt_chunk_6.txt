P5); FIR No. 183/2000, (Ex.P6); application submitted by Ram Lal for recruitment to the post of constable (Ex.P-7); letter of appointment dated 08.11.1991 (ExP-8); verifi cation letter fi led by Ramlal (Ex.P9); appointment dated 16.12.1991, (Ex-P-10); letter of Government School Tiloniya, Ex.P-11; and chargesheet dated 24.04.2003, Ex.P-12. 21. It is very clear that relevant and material evidence being, the deposition of PW-5/Raj Singh; the marksheet of 8th class of the appellant [enclosed to the chargesheet] and the original marksheet independently marked as Ex. D3 by the defence have been completely left out in the discussion and consideration. Inference has been drawn about the proof of the charges by ignoring crucial, relevant and material evidence which had come on record. The evidence of PW-5 Raj Singh and the marksheet enclosed in the documents annexed to the chargesheet and the original marksheet marked as Ex. D-3, were materials having a direct bearing on the charge. The Disciplinary Authority has merely reiterated the reasoning in the enquiry report. Equally so are the fi ndings of the appellate authority. It is well settled that if the fi ndings of the disciplinary authorities are arrived at after ignoring the relevant material the court in judicial review can interfere. It is only to satisfy ourselves to this extent, that we have scrutinized the material to see as to what was refl ected in the record. We are satisfi ed that the disciplinary proceedings are vitiated and deserves to be quashed. 22. In this scenario, we are inclined to accept the explanation given by the appellant that overwriting in the application form was only due to correction of an inadvertent error. As long as the original 8th standard marksheet refl ected his date of birth as 21.04.1972 and there is no correction or manipulation in that document, the appellant cannot be penalised. Eff ect of Acquittal in the Criminal Proceeding – Question No. 2: 23. With this above background, if we examine the criminal proceedings the following factual position emerges. The very same witnesses, who were 818 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. examined in the departmental enquiry were examined in the criminal trial. Jagdish Chandra, Bhawani Singh, Shravan Lal, Raj Singh and Karan Sharma were examined as PW2, PW3, PW6, PW9 and PW13 respectively at the criminal trial. Apart from them, eight other witnesses were also examined. The gravamen of the charge in the criminal case was that the appellant had submitted an application for recruitment along with his marksheet and he, by making alteration in his date of birth to refl ect the same as 24.04.1972 in place of 21.04.1974, and obtained recruitment to the post of Constable. Though the Trial Court convicted the appellant under Section 420 of IPC, the Appellate Court recorded the following crucial fi ndings while acquitting the appellant: “….Mainly the present case was based on the documents to this eff ect whether the date of birth of accused is 21.04.1972 or 21.04.1974. Exh. P-3 is original Marksheet, in which, the date of birth of accused has been shown as 21.04.1972 and same has also been proved by the witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution.
