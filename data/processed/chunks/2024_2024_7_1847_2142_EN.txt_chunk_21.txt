Unless the decision is shown to be contrary to any statutory provision or the Constitution, the Court would not interfere with an economic decision taken by the State. The court cannot examine the relative merits of different economic policies and cannot strike down the same merely on ground that another policy would have been fairer and better. … 169. It is neither within the domain of the courts nor the scope of judicial review to embark upon an inquiry as to whether a particular public policy is wise or whether better public policy can be evolved. Nor are the courts inclined to strike down a policy at the behest of a petitioner merely because it has been urged that a different policy would have been fairer or wiser or more scientific or more logical. Wisdom and advisability of economic policy are ordinarily not amenable to judicial review. In matters relating to 7 [2006] Supp. 10 SCR 606 : (2007) 14 SCC 517 8 [2009] 9 SCR 225 : (2009) 7 SCC 561 1880 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports economic issues the Government has, while taking a decision, right to “trial and error” as long as both trial and error are bona fide and within the limits of the authority. For testing the correctness of a policy, the appropriate forum is Parliament and not the courts. 170. Normally, there is always a presumption that the governmental action is reasonable and in public interest and it is for the party challenging its validity to show that it is wanting in reasonableness or is not informed with public interest. This burden is a heavy one and it has to be discharged to the satisfaction of the court by proper and adequate material. The court cannot lightly assume that the action taken by the Government is unreasonable or against public interest because there are a large number of considerations, which necessarily weigh with the Government in taking an action.” (Emphasis supplied) 25 (a) 5. In Academy of Nutrition Improvement v. Union of India, (2-Judge Bench)9 where the challenge to iodised salt was made and it was reiterated that: “…. courts should not rush in where even scientists and medical experts are careful to tread. The rule of prudence is that courts will be reluctant to interfere with policy decisions taken by the Government, in matters of public health, after collecting and analysing inputs from surveys and research. Nor will courts attempt to substitute their own views as to what is wise, safe, prudent or proper, in relation to technical issues relating to public health in preference of those formulated by persons said to possess technical expertise and rich experience.” (Emphasis supplied) 25 (a) 6. A similar view was taken in Lafarge Umiam Mining (P) Ltd. v. Union of India (3-Judge Bench),10 wherein this Court observed: 9 [2011] 8 SCR 680 : (2011) 8 SCC 274 10 [2011] 7 SCR 954 : (2011) 7 SCC 338 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1881 Gene Campaign & Anr.
