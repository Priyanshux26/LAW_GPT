Hence there was no occasion whatsoever in the instant case to exercise the power under Section 482 to quash the complaint. In that view, the impugned dated 12.02.2019 passed by the High Court in Criminal Petition Nos.12652, 12670, 12675, and 12676 of 2018 is not sustainable. 17. The impugned is accordingly set aside. 18. The complaints bearing CC No.681 of 2017, CC No.644 of 2017, CC No.250 of 2018, and CC No.254 of 2018 are restored to the fi le of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Visakhapatnam. Keeping in view that the K. HYMAVATHI v. THE STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH & 423 ANR. [A. S. BOPANNA, J.] matter has been pending from the year 2017, the Trial Court shall now proceed with the matters as expeditiously as possible but in any event shall dispose of the matter within six months from the date on which a copy of this is furnished. 19. Before parting with the matter, we would like to place on record and command the usual, able assistance rendered by Mr. Sidharth Luthra, learned senior counsel as Amicus Curiae in the absence of respondent, in guiding this Court to arrive at its conclusion. 20. The appeals are accordingly allowed with no as to costs. 21. Pending application, if any, shall stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals allowed. Divya Pandey
