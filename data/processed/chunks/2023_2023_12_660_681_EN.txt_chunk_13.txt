Indisputably, the 1923 Act is a pre-independence statute therefore, on India being declared a Republic by our Constitution, the use of the phrase “His Majesty’s naval, military or air forces” appearing therein became antithetical to our Constitution. Hence, to make it in accord with our Constitution, it was considered necessary to substitute the said phrase with the phrase “armed forces of the Union.” However, neither the Constitution of India (see Article 366) nor The General Clauses Act, 1897 or the 1923 Act defi nes “armed forces of the Union”. Therefore, in our view, mere declaration in Section 3 of the 1957 Act that the RPF shall be an “armed force of the Union” is not suffi cient to take it out of the purview of the 1923 Act. In our view, what assumes importance is the legislative intent. That is, whether by declaring a member of the RPF as a member of the armed force of the Union, the legislature intended to take away the benefi ts which he would have otherwise got by virtue of being a railway servant within the meaning of Section 2 (34) of the 1989 Act. 59. The defi nition of a “Railway Servant” as contained in Section 2 (34) of the 1989 Act was amended vide Act No.51 of 2003, with eff ect from 1.7.2004. By such amendment, notwithstanding that from 20.09.1985 the RPF was declared an armed force of the Union, the defi nition of a Railway Servant included a member of the RPF. Therefore, since a railway servant continued to be a workman as per Section 2(1)(n)(i) of the 1923 Act, the provisions of the 1923 Act would continue to apply to a member of the 680 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. RPF as he does not belong to any of those categories specifi ed in Schedule II of the 1923 Act. More so, when there is nothing in the Railways Act, either new or old, which may exclude the applicability of the 1923 Act on a railway servant. Rather, Section 128 of the 1989 Act makes it clear that right of any person to claim compensation under Section 124 or Section 124-A of the 1989 Act shall not aff ect the right of any such person to recover compensation payable under the 1923 Act. Likewise, Section 19 of the 1957 Act, which was simultaneously amended vide Act No.60 of 1985, with eff ect from 20.09.1985, along with Section 3 of the 1957 Act, declaring RPF as an armed force of the Union, did not make any provision to exclude the applicability of the 1923 Act. Not only that, Section 10 of the 1957 Act was also amended vide Act No.60 of 1985. It too, declared every member of the Force (RPF) to be regarded as railway servant for all purposes other than Chapter VIA of the 1890 Act, which relates to limitation on duty hours, etc. Thus, in our considered view, despite declaring RPF as an armed force of the Union, the legislative intent was not there to exclude its members or their heirs from the benefi ts of compensation payable under the 1923 Act or the 1989 Act.
