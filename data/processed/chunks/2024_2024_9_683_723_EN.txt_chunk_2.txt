[Paras 32, 33] [Per Surya Kant, J.] 686 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Bail – Constitution of India – Art. 21 – Penal Code, 1860 – s.477A – Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – s.7 – Whether the appellant is entitled to the relief of regular bail: Held: The FIR was registered on 17.08.2022, and since then, the chargesheet along with four supplementary chargesheets have been filed – The fourth supplementary chargesheet was filed as recently as 29.07.2024 and the Trial Court has taken cognizance of the same – Additionally, seventeen accused persons have been named, 224 individuals have been identified as witnesses, and extensive documentation, both physical and digital, has been submitted – These factors suggest that the completion of the trial is unlikely to occur in the immediate future – Although the procedure for the appellant’s arrest meets the requisite criteria for legality and compliance, continued incarceration for an extended period pending trial would infringe upon established legal principles and the appellant’s right to liberty, traceable to Article 21 of our Constitution – The Appellant has been granted interim bail by this Court in the ED matter on 10.05.2024 and 12.07.2024, arising from the same set of facts – Additionally, several co-accused in both the CBI and ED matters have also been granted bail by the Trial Court, the High Court, and this Court in separate proceedings – So far as the apprehension of the Appellant influencing the outcome of the trial is concerned, it seems that all evidence and material relevant to the CBI’s disposition is already in their possession, negating the likelihood of tampering by the Appellant – Therefore, in the light of these extenuating circumstances and considering the foregoing analysis, it could be resolved that the Appellant satisfies the requisite conditions for the grant of bail. [Paras 39, 40, 41, 42] [Per Surya Kant, J.] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Regular bail – Filing of charge-sheet – Whether the filing of a chargesheet is a change in circumstances warranting relegation to the trial court for grant of regular bail: Held: It is true that generally the trial Court should consider the prayer seeking bail once the chargesheet is filed, since the material that an Investigating Authority may have been able to procure would undoubtedly facilitate that court to form a prima facie opinion with regard to (i) the gravity of offence; (ii) the degree of involvement of the applicant; (iii) the background and vulnerability of the witnesses; (iv) the approximate timeline for conclusion of the trial based on [2024] 9 S.C.R. 687 Arvind Kejriwal v. Central Bureau of Investigation the number of witnesses; and (v) the societal impact of granting or denying bail – However, there can be no straitjacket formula which enumerates that every case concerning the consideration of bail should depend upon the filing of a chargesheet – In fact, each case ought to be assessed on its own merits, recognizing that no one-size fits all formula exists for determining bail – An undertrial thus should, ordinarily, first approach the trial Court for bail, as this process not only provides the accused an opportunity for initial relief but also allows the High Court to serve as a secondary avenue if the trial Court denies bail for inadequate reasons – If an accused approaches the High Court directly without first seeking relief from the Trial Court, it is generally appropriate for the High Court to redirect them to the Trial Court at the threshold – This issue is however, more or less academic in the instant case as the High Court did not relegate the appellant to the trial Court at the preliminary stage – Since notice was issued and the parties were apparently heard on merits by the High Court, it not necessary at this stage to relegate the appellant to the trial Court even though filing of a chargesheet is a change in the circumstances – Thus, appellant directed to be released on bail.
