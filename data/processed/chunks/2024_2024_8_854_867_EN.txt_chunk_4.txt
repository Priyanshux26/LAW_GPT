The Resolution was :- “as per rules not confirmed”. Post to be re- advertised.” 14. On 06.02.2019, the Appellant was informed that (in continuation of the University’s letter of 28.12.2018) her continuation in the post beyond 28.02.2019 was not possible and that the service against the lien was to expire on 28.02.2019. She was also asked if she was interested to work as a Guest Faculty and if so, she was asked to apply for the same, after observing all the formalities. 15. The Appellant represented to the Registrar, Tripura University, asking for reasons for the proposed discontinuance. The Appellant also sought a response to her letter of 28.12.2018 and further letters to the Vice-Chancellor and the Dean dated 24.01.2019. No reply was forthcoming. Proceedings before the High Court: 16. The Appellant filed a Writ Petition No. 302 of 2019 before the High Court impugning the Resolution of the 32nd Meeting of the Executive Council dated 13.12.2018 and the letter of the Registrar dated 06.02.2019 and prayed that she be confirmed in the post of Assistant Professor in Law, Tripura University. An interim of 28.02.2019 was passed suspending the Resolution of the 32nd Meeting of the Executive Council and the letter dated 06.02.2019 of the Registrar. 17. A counter affidavit came to be filed by the Respondent-University. A plea was set up that discretion lay with the authority about the continuance of the Appellant, even if the candidate holding the lien had vacated the lien. It was further averred that the issue about regularizing or re-advertising was in the larger interest of the candidates who had not applied (as the post was under lien). What is significant is that nothing adverse about the appellant was set out anywhere in the counter. By a of 04.12.2019, a learned Single Judge, while rejecting the contentions of the Appellant and dismissing the writ petition held as follows:- “[9] The stand taken by the Tripura University one can find no fault. It can be appreciated that when a temporary vacancy is advertised which vacancy is created on account [2024] 8 S.C.R. 861 Maitreyee Chakraborty v. The Tripura University & Ors. of the substantive holder of the post not being available for a temporary period, many eligible interested candidates may be persuaded not to apply. If a person is holding a permanent post or even a semi-permanent engagement under some other organization, he may not want to join a temporary vacancy, resign from his permanent or semi- permanent engagement at the risk of being told sometime later and since the lien holder has returned back and is likely to join his original position he should vacate the post. In that view of the matter, the decision of the Executive Council to re-advertise the post once the post became permanently vacant stands to reason. The decision therefore must be upheld.” 18. Aggrieved by the of the learned Single Judge, the Appellant preferred a Writ Appeal No. 5 of 2020 before the Division Bench of the High Court.
