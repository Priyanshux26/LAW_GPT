Admittedly, physical custody has not been given to the respondents. Admission of the appellant to the hospital of his choice cannot be termed as a physical custody in favour of the respondents. Custody could not be taken on the basis of the interim passed by the High Court which certainly shall not come in the way of calculating the period of 15 days. An investigating agency is expected to be given a reasonable freedom to do it’s part. To say that the respondents ought to have examined the appellant in the hospital, and that too with the permission of the doctors, can never be termed as an adequate compliance. 87. Any of the Court is not meant to aff ect a person adversely despite its ultimate conclusion in his favour. The doctrine actus curiae neminem gravabit would certainly apply in calculating the period of 15 days. 930 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 88. SUMMATION OF LAW: i. When an arrestee is forwarded to the jurisdictional Magistrate under Section 19(3) of the PMLA, 2002 no writ of Habeus Corpus would lie.

The words “such custody” occurring in Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 would include not only a police custody but also that of other investigating agencies. vii. The word “custody” under Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 shall mean actual custody. viii. Curtailment of 15 days of police custody by any extraneous circumstances, act of God, an of Court not being the handi work of investigating agency would not act as a restriction. ix.
