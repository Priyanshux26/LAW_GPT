At the very latest, therefore, on the facts of this case, time began to run on and from 12-2-2007. The appellant’s laconic letter dated 23-1-2007, which stated that the matter was under consideration, was within the 30-day period. On and from 12-2-2007, when no arbitrator was appointed, the cause of action for appointment of an arbitrator accrued to the respondent and time began running from that day. Obviously, once time [2024] 3 S.C.R. 105 M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v.

It’s time now to apply the dicta laid down in the aforesaid s to the facts of the present case. The notice for invocation of arbitration was issued by the petitioner to the respondent on 24.11.2022, proposing the names of two learned arbitrators and calling upon the respondent to either release the allegedly withheld payment or nominate an arbitrator from their side within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice. As per the record, the notice was delivered to the respondent on 29.11.2022. The relevant extracts from the said notice are extracted hereinbelow: “14.
