Dharmendra Kumar, Ramkishan Dev Murari and Headmaster Sh. Vishnu Miyani are mentioned. I am acquainted with their signatures.” 17. Most importantly dealing with the 8th class marksheet of the appellant, which formed the basis for his application seeking appointment as Constable, PW-5/Raj Singh stated as under:- 816 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. “The 8th class marksheet of Ramlal enclosed in the documents, which is Exh. P-3, (sic) in which, whether any alteration has been found in the date of birth anywhere, and whether date of birth has been mentioned as 21.04.1972 therein - Yes, no alteration has been made in the marksheet of 8th class and date of birth is 21.04.1972.” 18. It is very clear from the above that no alteration was found in the Appellant’s 8th class marksheet (which forms part of the enclosed documents sent to the Commandant) and the date of birth mentioned on it was 21.04.1972. Reference to ‘P-3’ in the above extract appears to be a mistake. The chargesheet and documents enclosed were Ex. P-12/1 to P-12/12. The defence also exhibited the original 8th class marksheet separately as Exh. D-3, as is clear from the chart of Exhibits set out in the enquiry report. 19. The Enquiry Offi cer, after setting out the depositions of the witnesses, set out the chart of the “P” series Exhibits and the Exhibits of the delinquent, namely the “D” series, and without any further discussion or marshaling of the evidence recorded the following with regard to charge-1: “On perusal of statement of witnesses namely PW-1 PW-2, PW-3, PW-4, PW-5 and Exh. P-1 to P-12, it is clear that correct date of birth of delinquent constable was 21.04.1974. When, delinquent constable submitted application for recruitment on the post of Constable, at that time, he did not complete the age of 18 years, therefore, due to the apprehension of rejection of his application due to the less age, delinquent constable has altered his date of birth as 21.04.1972 from 21.04.1974, therefore, Charge No.1 stands proved. Delinquent Constable has also passed 10th class, whose marksheet is Exh. P-4, in which, his date of birth is mentioned as 21.04.1974.” In so far as charge-2 was concerned, it was merely noticed that challan had been fi led in the criminal case as on 28.02.2004, the date of enquiry report, and that the trial had not concluded. 20. In the operative part of the enquiry report under the head, ‘conclusions’, there is no reference to the 8th class marksheet, (which was part of the enclosed documents sent by Constable Raj Singh with the chargesheet) or to Exh.D-3 [the original 8th class marksheet] exhibited by the defence. There is also no reference to the statement of Raj Singh PW-5 RAM LAL V. STATE OF RAJASTHAN & ORS. 817 in the enquiry, who had acknowledged that there was no alteration in the marksheet of the 8th class. What is referred to in the chart of exhibits are letter of Jagdish Chand (Ex.P1); the duplicate marksheet of 8th class issued by Jagdish Chand (Ex.P2); the statement of Shravan Lal (Ex-P3); 10th class marksheet of Secondary Education Board Rajasthan, Ajmer, (Ex.P4); preliminary enquiry dated 16.10.2002 by Circle Offi cer, Kishangarh (Ex.
