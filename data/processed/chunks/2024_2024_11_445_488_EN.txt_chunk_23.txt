Section 25(1) of the Customs Act under which the notification is issued reads as under: “25. Power to grant exemption from duty.- (1) If the Central Government is satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette, exempt generally either absolutely or subject to such conditions (to be fulfilled before or after clearance), as may be specified in the notification goods of any specified description from the whole or any part of duty of customs leviable thereon.” 51. It will be very clear that for an exemption under the Customs Act to operate thereon there has to be a notification issued in the manner provided by the Customs Act and duly published in the official gazette. It is so well settled that if a certain thing has to be done in a certain manner, it shall be done in that manner or not at all. [See Babu Verghese and Others vs. Bar Council of Kerala and Others (1999) 3 SCC 422, relying on Taylor vs. Taylor (1875) 1 C h D 426 and Nazir Ahmad vs. King Emperor, AIR 1936 PC 253]. Further, Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 clearly prescribes as under:- “21. Power to issue, to include power to add to, amend, vary or rescind, notifications, s, rules or bye-laws.—Where, by any Central Act or Regulation, a power to issue notifications, s, rules, or bye-laws is conferred, then that power includes a power, exercisable in the like manner and subject to the like sanction and conditions (if any) to add to, amend, vary or rescind any notifications, s, rules or bye-laws so issued.” (Emphasis Supplied) [2024] 11 S.C.R. 481 Nabha Power Limited & Anr. v. Punjab State Power Coroporation Limited & Anr. There was no duly constituted amendment notification as on 01.10.2009. 52. The exemption notification has to be read with the then extant policy of 07.08.2006 under which Mega Power Policy, to obtain a Mega Power Status, the plant had to be an inter-State power plant of the prescribed dimensions and if it were so, certain financial concessions/benefits were to be available to it under the policy document. Admittedly, that policy of 07.08.2006 was duly promulgated by the Government of India through Ministry of Power and there is no dispute on this score. 53. What the appellant contends is that with the press release on 01.10.2009 and they having received no positive response to the letters of 02.10.2009 and 06.10.2009 (since withdrawn), they in their bid of 09.10.2009 factored in the benefits that would be available in view of the Cabinet decision as announced in the press release of 01.10.2009. According to the appellants, as such, when the notifications for amendment were issued on 11.12.2009 and when the policy document was amended on 14.12.2009, there was no change in law because the legal regime stood altered on 01.10.2009 with the press release. Respondents contended that any clarification for the bid ought to have been sought before 25.09.2009 and independent of that they also contend that press release of 01.10.2009 does not tantamount to law and that the change in law happened only on 11.12.2009/14.12.2009.
