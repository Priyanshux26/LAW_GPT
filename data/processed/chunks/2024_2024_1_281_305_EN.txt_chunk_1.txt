[Paras 28, 29, 30, 31, 33] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s. 37 – The High Court upheld the modification of the arbitral award by the Civil Judge u/s. 37 of the Act – Propriety: Held: The Single Judge of the High Court, similar to the Civil Judge u/s. 34, appears to have not concerned themselves with the contours of s.37 of the Act – The Court u/s. 37 had only three options:- (a) Confirming the award of the Arbitrator; (b) Setting aside the award as modified u/s. 34; and (c) Rejecting the application(s) u/s. 34 and 37 – The single Judge has examined the reasoning adopted by the Arbitrator in respect of certain claims (claims 3 and 7, particularly) and held that allowing a claim for escalation of cost, was without satisfactory material having been placed on record and is “perverse and contrary to the public policy” – However, it appears that such a holding on part of the Judge is without giving reasons therefor – It has not been discussed as to what the evidence was before the single Judge to arrive at such conclusion – In the absence of compliance with the well laid out parameters and contours of both s.34 and s.37 of the Act, the impugned s are set aside – Consequently, the award dated 18.02.2003 of the Arbitrator is restored.
