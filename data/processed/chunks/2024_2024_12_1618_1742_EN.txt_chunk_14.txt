46 of 2022 pending before the Hon’ble DRT I, Mumbai;” (Emphasis supplied) 20. Interestingly, the Borrower herein never challenged the legality or propriety of the 9th Auction that was conducted by the Bank in the aforesaid writ petition before the High Court of judicature at Bombay. Although, in the aforesaid writ petition, the Borrower had itself stated that the 9th notice of sale was published on 12.06.2023 and auction thereto was conducted on 30.06.2023, yet far from imputing procedural impropriety as regards the valuation of the Secured Asset in the said 9th Auction, no challenge was ever made to the manner in which the notice of sale dated 12.06.2023 came to be issued i.e., there was no challenge to the validity of the said notice. We shall discuss the pleadings of the Borrower herein and the scope of proceedings before the High Court in more detail in the latter part of this . 21. Before the High Court, the Borrowers expressed their willingness to pay a total sum of Rs. 129 crore for redeeming the mortgage by 31.08.2023. The Bank which had earlier opposed the plea for redemption of mortgage before the DRT for some good reason expressed its willingness before the High Court to accept the offer of the borrowers. The Bank perhaps got lured by the fact that the [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1639 Celir LLP v. Mr. Sumati Prasad Bafna & Ors. borrowers were paying almost Rs. 23.95 crore more than what was paid by the petitioner herein and Rs. 5 crore more than the outstanding amount. 22. In the wake of such development, the petitioner herein having come to know about the aforesaid proceedings before the High Court preferred Interim Application (ST) No. 21706 of 2023 for being impleaded in the writ petition. 23. The writ petition along with interim application was heard by the High Court and vide its and dated 17.08.2023 allowed the writ petition and permitted the borrowers to redeem the mortgage of the secured asset subject to payment of Rs. 25 crore on the same day and the balance amount of Rs. 104 crore on or before 31.08.2023, failing which the sale of the Secured Asset in favour of the petitioner herein would be confirmed. ii. Developments during the pendency of Civil Appeal Nos. 5542-5543 of 2023. 24. Aggrieved by the aforesaid, the petitioner herein preferred Special Leave Petition Nos. 19523-19524 of 2023 (later renumbered as Civil Appeal Nos. 5542-5543 of 2023) before this Court, challenging the final and dated 17.08.2023 passed by the High Court. The aforesaid Special Leave Petitions were instituted on 21.08.2023 and it is pertinent to note that there was a caveat at the end of the Borrower herein, and thus the Borrower was fully aware of the aforesaid Special Leave Petition pending before this Court. 25. On 25.08.2023, the aforesaid special leave petitions were taken up for hearing by this Court for the first time and the Borrower herein was also present during the hearing through his counsel.
