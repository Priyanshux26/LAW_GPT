In the present case, the appellant’s conduct, including the initiation of frivolous legal proceedings, falls squarely within the definition of mental cruelty. The respondent’s claim is further supported by this Court’s in Samar Ghosh (Supra), wherein it was recognized that actions causing sustained emotional torment and loss of trust in the marital relationship constitutes cruelty. 29. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the appellant’s actions were not isolated incidents but formed a pattern of behavior that made cohabitation impossible. In V. Bhagat vs. D. Bhagat,7 this Court emphasized that sustained and deliberate acts of cruelty make it unreasonable to expect one spouse to continue living with the other. 30. The fact that the parties have been living separately for two decades now further reinforces the conclusion that the marriage is no longer viable. Prolonged separation, as observed in K. Srinivas Rao vs. D.A. Deepa,8 creates a presumption of the marriage having irretrievably broken down. In this case, the parties have not shared a marital life since 2004, and all attempts at reconciliation have failed. 31. Marriage is a relationship built on mutual trust, companionship, and shared experiences. When these essential elements are missing for an extended period, the marital bond becomes a mere legal formality devoid of any substance. This Court has consistently held that prolonged separation, coupled with inability to reconcile, is a relevant factor in deciding matrimonial disputes. In the present case, the length of separation and the evident animosity between the parties make it clear that there is no possibility of the marriage being revived. 32. Although irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not a statutory ground for divorce under the HMA, this Court has, in appropriate cases, invoked its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to grant relief where the marriage is beyond repair. In Naveen Kohli (Supra), this Court observed that when a marriage has irretrievably 7 [1993] Supp. 3 SCR 796 : (1994) 1 SCC 337 8 [2013] 2 SCR 126 : (2013) 5 SCC 226 766 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports broken down, forcing the parties to remain together serves no purpose and only prolongs their misery. 33. The evidence in the present case points unequivocally to an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. The appellant and the respondent have been embroiled in legal disputes for years, with no signs of reconciliation. The respondent has expressed his desire to move on with his life, while the appellant, despite her assertions to the contrary, has failed to demonstrate any genuine willingness to repair the relationship. As held by this Court in Ashok Hurra vs. Rupa Bipin Zaveri9 and Shilpa Sailesh vs. Varun Sreenivasan,10 prolonging a dead marriage serves no interest and only perpetuates the agony of the parties involved. 34. It is evident from the record that continuation of the marriage would only lead to further animosity and litigation, causing harm to both parties. The appellant’s insistence on reconciliation appears to be more of a strategy to prolong the proceedings rather than a genuine effort to revive the relationship.
