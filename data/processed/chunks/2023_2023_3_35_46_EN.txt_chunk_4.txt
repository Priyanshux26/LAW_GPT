C 3.1 It is vehemently submitted that as such there was a huge delay of 853 days in submitting the application for extension of time to deposit the amount under section 148 CPC and Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act. It is submitted that no sufficient cause was shown and/or there was no explanation whatsoever given by the decree holder as to D why he did not pay the balance sale consideration as per the and decree dated 12.10.2013 or did not make an application under Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, seeking extension of time to make the payment of balance sale consideration. 3.2 It is vehemently submitted that even as per the original plaintiff E he became sick with Jaundice and was treated in the hospital from 1.11.2013 to 5.1.2014 only. It is submitted that it is not believable at all that thereafter he was confined to house with High Blood Pressure, Diabetes and other diseases for approximately two years. It is submitted that therefore in absence of any reasonable explanation, the trial Court ought not to have condoned the huge delay of 853 days occurred in filing F the application for extension of time to deposit the balance sale consideration as per the and decree passed by the trial Court. It is submitted that therefore the High Court has committed a very serious error in dismissing the revision applications. 3.3 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on G behalf of the appellant that as such the original plaintiff obtained the ex- parte and decree dated 12.10.2013. It is submitted that the original defendant – mother of the appellant died on 13.01.2015. Till her death, no efforts were made by the plaintiff to deposit the balance sale consideration of Rs. 15,00,000/-. It is submitted that neither the balance H P. SHYAMALA v. GUNDLUR MASTHAN 41 [M. R. SHAH, J.] sale consideration as directed by the trial Court was paid, nor any steps A were taken to get the sale deed executed by the original defendant. It is submitted that the aforesaid conduct on the part of the original plaintiff disentitles him for any relief of extension of time for deposit of the balance sale consideration and therefore the trial Court ought to have rescinded the agreement to sell dated 9.5.2012, in exercise of powers under Section B 28 of the Specific Relief Act. Heavy reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of V.S. Palanichamy Chettiar Firm v. C. Alagappan and Another, reported in (1999) 4 SCC 702 (paragraphs 14, 16 & 17). 3.4 It is further submitted that even the equity is also in favour of C the appellant. It is submitted that after the ex-parte and decree, in the year 2013 the prices of the agricultural land in question have gone up to Rs. 3 crores. It is submitted that despite the and decree, non-deposit of the balance sale consideration of Rs. 15,00,000/- at the relevant time, i.e., within a period of two weeks from the and decree dated 12.10.2013, disentitle the plaintiff seeking any extension D and it can be inferred that the plaintiff was not ready and willing to perform his part of the contract and even as directed by the trial Court and therefore this is a fit case to rescind the agreement to sell dated 9.5.2012, in exercise of powers under Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act.
