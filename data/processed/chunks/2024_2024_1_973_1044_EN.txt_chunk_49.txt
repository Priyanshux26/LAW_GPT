It also cannot be ignored that the development plan has been finalized after undergoing the rigorous process including that of inviting objections and suggestions at two stages, giving the hearing to such objectors and suggesters and after considering the same. If any of the citizen has any grievance that any provision is detrimental to the environment or ecology, it is always open to raise a challenge to such an independent provision before the appropriate forum. Such a challenge can be considered in accordance with law. But, in our view, the development plan, which has been finalized after taking recourse to the statutory provisions and undergoing the rigors thereto, cannot be stalled in entirety thereby putting the entire developmental activities to a standstill. 125. Insofar as the grievance of the Interveners, who are the plot holders in the ‘Green Belt’ area, with regard to payment of compensation is concerned, we find that the said issue would be beyond the scope of the present proceedings. We, therefore, without specifying any opinion on such claim, relegate the interveners to avail the appropriate remedy available to them in law. 126. In the result, we pass the following : (i) The Civil Appeal Nos. 5348-49 of 2019 as well as the Transferred Case (C) No. 2 of 2023 are allowed; (ii) The s of the NGT dated 16th November 2017 in Original Application No. 121 of 2014, dated 16th July 2018 in Review Application No. 8 of 2018, dated 12th May 2022 and 14th October 2022 in Original Application No. 297 of 2022 are quashed and set aside; and (iii) The appellant-State of Himachal Pradesh and its instrumentalities are permitted to proceed with the implementation of the development plan as published on 20th June 2023 subject to what has been observed by us hereinabove. 1044 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
