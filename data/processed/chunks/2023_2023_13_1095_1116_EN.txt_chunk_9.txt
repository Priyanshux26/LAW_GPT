“goods made of glass and glasswares”. The full bench in para 7 noticed that undoubtedly there is distinction between glass, goods or articles made of glass. After doing so, it quoted a passage from the of the Board wherein it was held by the Board that glass sheet, is glass simplicitor. Glass sheet is, therefore, according to the Full Bench a primary product which can be used for producing the goods or articles made of glass and it cannot be equivated with goods or articles made of glass. The Full Bench expressed its dissent with the decision reported in Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Nagpur v. Mohanlal Ramkisan Nathani (1955) 6 STC 136 and Tribuwandas Golabchand and Brothers, Nagpur V. State of Maharashtra (1965) 16 STC 452 (Bombay) and CST Vs Bombay Glasshouse (1986) 63 STC 350 (M.P.). The Full Bench was of the opinion that in these decisions, it was not taken into account that the glass sheet is common parlance is glass simplicitor” and glass sheet is a primary product used for producing articles of goods made of glass. Glass sheet is a primary product.” This distinguishes the case from the facts of the present case.” 21. This Court in Atul Glass industries Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Collector of Central Excise, (1986) 63 STC 322 has held the test commonly applied to determine whether an article after subjecting to manufacturing processes becomes a diff erent article or remains the same is: how is the product identifi ed by the class or section of the people dealing with or using such product. It came to be held: “8. The test commonly applied to such cases is: How is the product identifi ed by the class or section of people dealing with or using the product? That is a test which is attracted whenever the statute does not contain any defi nition. Porritts and Spencer (Asia) Ltd. v. State of Haryana [(1979) 1 SCC 82 : 1979 SCC (Tax) 38 : AIR 1979 SC 300 : (1978) 42 STC 433]. It is generally by its functional character that a product is so identifi ed. In CST, U.P. v. Macneill & Barry Ltd., Kanpur [(1986) 1 SCC 23 : 1986 SCC (Tax) 155] this Court expressed the view that ammonia paper and ferro paper, used for obtaining prints and sketches of site plans could not be described as paper as that word was used in common parlance. On the same basis the Orissa High Court held in State of Orissa v. Gestetner Duplicators (P) Ltd. [(1974) 33 M/S TRIVENI GLASS LIMITED REP. BY ITS DEPUTY 1109 GENERAL MANAGER (SALES AND P.R.) SHRI R.K. SINHA v. COMMISSIONER OF TRADE TAX, U.P. [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] STC 333 (Ori)] that stencil paper could not be classifi ed as paper for the purposes of the Orissa Sales Tax Act. It is a matter of common experience that the identity of an article is associated with its primary function. It is only logical that it should be so.
