It may be noted that non-production of the relevant documents especially the documents in respect of which the relief is sought, along with the C SLPs could be the sole ground for rejection of the SLPs at the outset. 31. The Registry is also directed to verify at the time of registration of SLPs as to whether all the relevant documents, more particularly, the documents in respect of which the relief is sought, have been produced at the first instance by the petitioners along with the SLPs or not. D 32. In that view of the matter, the petitions are dismissed. The interim relief granted earlier stands vacated forthwith. It is needless to say that the observations made against the petitioners in this are only prima facie and the trial court shall decide the case on merits without being influenced by the said observations. E 33. Learned counsel for the respondents, on instructions, informs this Court that since the investigation is over and charge-sheet has been filed, no custodial interrogation of the petitioner is required. 34. The E.D shall be at liberty to proceed further with the Prosecution complaint in accordance with law. F 35. Copy of this be sent to the Secretary General and the Registrar (J-I) for doing the needful. Divya Pandey Petitions dismissed. (Assisted by : Bhavyata Kapoor, LCRA) G H
