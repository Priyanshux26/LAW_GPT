Therefore, C before second proviso of section 140(5) is attracted, there must be a detailed enquiry against an auditor of a company as per first part of section 140(5) and there must be a finding arrived at by the NCLT that the auditor of a company has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraud D by, or in relation to, the company or its directors or officers. [Para 5.3][1006-A-G] 3. Subsequent resignation of an auditor after the application is filed under section 140(5) by itself shall not terminate the proceedings under section 140(5). Resignation and/or removal E of an auditor cannot be said to be an end of the proceedings under section 140(5). There are further consequences also on culmination of the enquiry under section 140(5) proceedings and passing a final by the Tribunal on the conduct of an auditor, whether such a auditor has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in F relation to, the company or its directors or officers, as provided under the second proviso to section 140(5) of the Act, 2013. Therefore, the enquiry/proceedings initiated under the first part of section 140(5) has to go to its logical end and subsequent resignation and/or discontinuance of an auditor shall not terminate G the enquiry/proceedings under section 140(5). If the interpretation given by the High Court that once an auditor resigns, the proceedings under section 140(5) stand terminated and are no longer further required to be proceeded, in that case, an auditor to avoid the final and the consequence of final as provided under the second proviso to section 140(5) H 954 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R.

The second proviso to section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 is a substantive provision, though it is by way of a proviso, and the same shall operate and/or depend upon the final to be B passed by the Tribunal in the first part of section 140(5). If the interpretation given by the High Court that on subsequent resignation and/or discontinuance of an auditor, proceedings under section 140(5) stand terminated and/or the petition under section 140(5) by the Central Government is no longer maintainable is accepted, in that case, second proviso to section 140(5) would C become nugatory and in no case there shall be any action under the second proviso to section 140(5). If such an interpretation, as interpreted by the High Court, is accepted, in that case, the object and purpose of incorporation of second proviso to section 140(5) shall be frustrated. The object and purpose of second D proviso to section 140(5) is to make the provision more stringent and to provide for consequences for an auditor when such an auditor is found to have been perpetrating a fraud and is removed by the NCLT for such fraud.
