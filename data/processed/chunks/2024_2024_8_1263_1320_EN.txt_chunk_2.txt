[Para 34.3] 1266 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – S. 35 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Regulation 33, Schedule I, Rule 12 – National Company Law Tribunal Rules, 2016 – R.11 – Whether Liquidator had violated Regulation 33 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016: Held: Schedule I under Regulation 33 lays down the manner in which the assets of the Corporate Debtor are to be sold by the Liquidator – Rule 12 under Schedule I, would have to be treated as mandatory in character for the reason that it contemplates a consequence in the event of non-payment of the balance sale consideration by the highest bidder within the stipulated timeline of 90 days, which is cancellation of the sale by the Liquidator – To that extent, there is substance in the submission made on behalf of the appellant that since the second proviso under Rule 12 contemplates a consequence of cancellation of the auction on non-payment of the balance sale consideration within 90 days, the Liquidator was not empowered to extend the timeline – In the present case, records reveal that when the Auction Purchaser had approached the Liquidator seeking extension of time to deposit the balance sale consideration – The Liquidator had rightly expressed his inability to do so and indicated that such a power vests only in the Adjudicating Authority – On receiving the aforesaid response, the Auction Purchaser did take steps to move the Adjudicating Authority for seeking extension of time for making the payments – It is a matter of record that the said application was allowed by the Adjudicating Authority on 05.05.2020 and time was granted to the Auction Purchaser to pay the balance sale consideration on the Central Government/State Government lifting the lockdown – The said was passed by the Adjudicating Authority in exercise of its inherent powers under Rule 11 of the NCLT Rules, 2016 – In the facts of the present case, the Adjudicating Authority exercised statutory powers under Section 35 of the IBC read with its inherent powers under Rule 11 of the NCLT Rules, 2016 for extending the time to deposit the balance sale consideration on sufficient cause being shown, i.e., in view of the countrywide lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic – This latitude that was given in the aforesaid extraordinary circumstances to meet the ends of justice, cannot be faulted. [Paras 35.1, 35.11, 35.14, 35.16] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 – Schedule I, Rule 12 and Rule 13 – What is the import of [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1267 V.S. Palanivel v. P. Sriram, CS, Liquidator, Etc. the of attachment issued by the Income Tax Authorities in respect of the auctioned property: Held: Rule 12 is held to be mandatory in character because non- payment within the timeline has consequences attached to it – However, in contrast thereto, there are no adverse consequences spelt out in Rule 13 for it to be treated as mandatory – The said Rule lays down the procedure for completion of the sale and would have to be treated as directory since some procedural steps have been set out for purposes of completion of the sale process, but nothing beyond that – This Court is therefore not inclined to accept the submissions made by the respondents that none of the activities as contemplated in Rule 12 could have been completed unless and until the attachment passed by the Income Tax Authorities was lifted or that the Liquidator was not in a position to complete the sale under Rule13 on that count – On an overall conspectus of the facts of the present case which brings out the glaring default on the part of the Auction Purchaser in making deposit of the balance sale consideration even after permission was granted by the Adjudicating Authority on 10.02.2020 to lift the attachment , the only question that needs to be answered is as to whether this Court should proceed to set aside the auction and as a sequence thereto, declare as null and void, the sale certificate issued by the Liquidator in favour of the Auction Purchaser, as has been pleaded by the appellant – The Subject land is now an operational hospital – Huge amounts have been pumped into the project by the Auction Purchaser – In contrast, the appellant has not been a vigilant litigant – He has dragged his feet at every stage – It took 19 months for the appellant to prefer an appeal before the Tribunal against the passed by the Adjudicating Authority – Also, it is a well settled legal position that once auction is confirmed, it ought to be interfered with on fairly limited grounds – In the given facts, the sale deed cannot be declared void.
