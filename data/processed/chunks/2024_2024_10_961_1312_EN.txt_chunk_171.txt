88 20. Reference to Tribunals.— Where in case of a person seeking registration under sub-section (3) of section 6A - (a) any question arises as to whether such person fulfils any requirement contained in the said sub- section; or (b) the opinion of the Tribunal constituted under the Foreigners (Tribunals) , 1964 in relation to such person does not contain a finding with respect to any requirement contained in the said sub-section other than the question that he is a foreigner, then, the registering authority shall, within a period of fifteen days of the receipt of the application under sub-rule (2) of rule 19, make a fresh reference to the Tribunal in this regard. 89 (4) A person registered under sub-section (3) shall have, as from the date on which he has been detected to be a foreigner and till the expiry of a period of ten years from that date, the same rights and obligations as a citizen of India (including the right to obtain a passport under the Passports Act, 1967 (15 of 1967) and the obligations connected therewith), but shall not be entitled to have his name included in any electoral roll for any Assembly or Parliamentary constituency at any time before the expiry of the said period of ten years. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1203 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 149. Section 6A(6)(a)90 of the Citizenship Act prescribes that any person referred to under section 6A(2) who doesn’t wish to become a citizen of India has to give a declaration within sixty days of the commencement of the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985. 150. Section 6A(6)(b)91 provides that any person referred to under section 6A(3) who doesn’t wish to become a citizen of India has to give a declaration within sixty days of coming into force of the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985 or from the date of detection as a foreigner, whichever is later. 151. A perusal of all the above provisions indicates that at every stage, except the first stage of detection, the mechanism for implementation of Section 6A is circumscribed by specific temporal limits. The same was taken note of by a Full Bench of the Gauhati High Court in State of Assam v. Moslem Mandal reported in 2013 SCC OnLine Gau 1: "108. Rule 16F of the Citizenship Rules, 1956, as amended in 2005, provides the time limit for registration of a foreigner within the meaning of section 6A(3), which is 30 days from the date of detection as a foreigner, which period is extendable by another 60 days by the registering authority for the reasons to be recorded in writing. Rule 16D of the said Rules also empowers the registering authority to make a reference to the Tribunal if any question arises as to whether such person complies with any requirement contained in section 6A(3) of the 1955 Act, which is required to be decided by the Tribunal under rule 16E of the said Rules. The 2009 Rules, which has repealed the 1956 Rules, also contains pari materia provisions.
