We have already explained the limitation in this approach. The Division Bench on the other hand, held that levy of penalty is substantive law, and as such, it cannot operate retrospectively. This again is a wrong approach. The substituted penalty only mollifies the rigour of the law by reducing the penalty from four times the duty to value of the duty. Therefore, the bar of Article 20(1)28 of imposing a penalty greater than the one in force at the time of the commission of the offence has no application. While rejecting the reasoning of the single Judge as well as the Division Bench, we seek to underscore the importance of a simple and plain understanding of laws and its processes, keeping in mind the purpose and object for which they seek to govern and regulate us. 35. For the reasons stated above, we allow the appeals and set aside the of the Division Bench of the High Court in Writ Appeals Nos. 425/2016, 6/2017, 7/2017, 8/2017, 9/2017, 10/2017, 11/2017, 12/2017, 13/2017, 14/2017, 15/2017, 16/2017, 17/2017, 19/2017, 20/2017, 21/2017, 22/2017, 23/2017, 24/2017, 25/2017, 26/2017, 27/2017, 28/2017, 29/2017, 30/2017, 31/2017, 32/2017, 33/2017, 34/2017, 35/2017, 36/2017, 37/2017, 38/2017, 39/2017, 40/2017, 41/2017, 42/2017 and 100/2017 dated 29.06.2017. We further hold that the penalty to be imposed on the appellants will be on the basis of Rule 19 as substituted on 29.03.2011. There shall be no as to costs.
