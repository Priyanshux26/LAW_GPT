Therefore, what was B contained in Exhibit P-75 was not even admitted signatures. In the absence of either admission or proof of the admitted signatures, the High Court could not have resorted to Section 73 of the Evidence Act. In view thereof, the finding recorded by the trial court and the High Court as though A-7 committed forgery and cheating by making applications for the issue of demand drafts C in the names of bogus firms is wholly unsustainable. [Paras 132, 135-137][71-F, G; 72-C-E] 4.11 The only connecting link pointed out against A-7 was the transfer of money to the total extent of Rs.1,52,50,000/- to the account of a firm of which he was a partner. This by itself will D not constitute any offence. Therefore, the charge that A-7 abetted the commission of the crime by the other accused, should also fail. This is especially so when A-5, whose proprietary concern bagged the contract, not only lost the contract but also allowed the bank guarantee to be invoked by the PSU and in addition, left E a huge amount of Rs.2.60 crores still with the PSU. Therefore, the conviction and sentence awarded to A-7 cannot be sustained. [Para 138][72-F-G] Suresh Chandra Bahri vs. State of Bihar 1995 Supp (1) SCC 80:[1994] 1 Suppl. SCR 483 – distinguished.
