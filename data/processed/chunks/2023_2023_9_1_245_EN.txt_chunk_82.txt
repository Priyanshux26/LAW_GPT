117. Section 20 deals with the meaning of ‘ordinarily resident’. It provides for various circumstances in which a person shall not be deemed H ANOOP BARANWAL v. UNION OF INDIA 113 [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] to be ordinarily resident as also circumstances in which he is deemed to A be ordinarily resident. Article 326 read with the provisions in the 1950 Act, which we have indicated, together provide the disqualifications for a person to be not included in an electoral roll. Before the deletion of the words ‘and illegal’ in Section 16(c), it provided for corrupt and illegal practices, which were relatable to the last part of Article 326. However, B the words ‘illegal practices’ have been omitted by Act 58 of 1960 w.e.f. 26.12.1960. Apparently, being relatable to ‘crime’, to be found in Article 326, Section 16(c) declares that a person may be disqualified for registration in the electoral roll on the basis of other offences in connection with elections.This means that a person would be disqualified for registration in the electoral roll, if he is disqualified under any law relating C to corrupt practices or any other offence in connection with elections. 118. In 1951, Parliament enacted The Representation of the People Act, 1951 (hereinafter referred to as, ‘the 1951 Act’). 119. Thereunder, the word ‘election’ has been defined in Section D 2(d) to mean ‘an election to fill a seat or seats in either House of Parliament or in the House or either House of the Legislature of a State. Section 2(e) defines the word ‘elector’ to mean ‘in relation to a constituency means a person whose name is entered in the electoral roll of that constituency for the time being in force and who is not subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in section 16 of E the Representation of the People Act, 1950 (43 of 1950)’. Under Part II, Chapter I deals with qualifications for membership of Parliament. Chapter II deals with qualifications for membership of State Legislatures. Chapter III of the 1951 Act provides for disqualifications for membership of Parliament and State Legislatures. Section 8, falling in Chapter III, F deals with disqualification upon conviction for certain offences. Various offences are enumerated with the conditions attached therein. Section 8A deals with disqualification for membership, for both Parliament and State Legislatures, on the ground of corrupt practices. Section 11A, as it stands, reads: G “11A. Disqualification arising out of conviction and corrupt practices.— (1) If any person, after the commencement of this Act,— is convicted of an offence punishable under section 171E or section 171F of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), or under section 125 H 114 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R.
