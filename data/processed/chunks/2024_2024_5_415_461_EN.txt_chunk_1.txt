417 Association For Democratic Reforms v. Election Commission of India And Another ballot paper system, rejected – Per Dipankar Datta, J. (Concurring) Use of EVMs in elections in India are not without its checks and balances – Reasonable measures to ensure transparency, such as tallying VVPAT paper trail in 5 EVMs per assembly constituency or assembly segment in a parliamentary constituency with votes polled, are already in place after the decision in N. Chandrababu Naidu v. Union of India – The aforesaid exercise of tallying has till date not resulted in any mismatch – This assertion of ECI not proved incorrect by petitioners – Grounds for the reliefs sought lie in the realm of apprehension and suspicion – Petitioners neither able to demonstrate how the use of EVMs in elections violates the principle of free and fair elections; nor were they able to establish a fundamental right to 100% VVPAT slips tallying with the votes cast – Their apprehensions are misplaced – Reverting to the paper ballot system and burdening the ECI with the onerous task of 100% VVPAT slips tallying would be a folly. [Paras 17, 19-21, 42, 58, 62, 68-70, 72, 75 and 10-12, 19] Elections – Electoral Process – Use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) – EVM-VVPAT (Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail) mechanism – Constitution of India – Article 19(1)(a) – Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 – r.49M – ‘transparent window’ – Alleged modification of the VVPAT in 2017, whereby the glass window on the VVPAT was made translucent/tinted instead of transparent, depriving the voter from knowing whether the vote cast by him was actually registered and counted – Petitioners submitted that a voter’s right to be informed u/Article 19(1)(a) vis-à-vis the electoral process have two facets- right to know that the vote is recorded as cast; and, secondly that the vote as cast is counted: Held: Per Sanjiv Khanna, J. (for himself and Dipankar Datta, J.) The test for determining the scope of unenumerated rights is based on tracing them to specific provision of Part III of the Constitution or to the core values which the Constitution espouses – Petitioners were neither able to demonstrate how the use of EVMs in elections violates the principle of free and fair elections; nor were they able to establish a fundamental right to 100% VVPAT slips tallying with the votes cast – While the fundamental right of voters to ensure their vote is accurately recorded and counted is acknowledged, the same cannot be equated with the right to 100% counting of VVPAT slips, or a right to physical access to 418 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the VVPAT slips, which the voter should be permitted to put in the drop box – These are two separate aspects – The former is the right itself and the latter is a plea to protect or how to secure the right – The voters’ right can be protected and safeguarded by adopting several measures – Direction in Subramanian Swamy v. Election Commission of India for gradual introduction of VVPATs to guarantee utmost transparency and integrity in the system has been implemented – The voter can see the VVPAT slip through the glass window and this assures the voter that his vote as cast has been recorded and will be counted – Further, ECI was categoric that the glass window on the VVPAT has not undergone any change – The term used in r.49M is ‘transparent window’ – The tinted glass used on the VVPAT printer is to maintain secrecy and prevent anyone else from viewing the VVPAT slips – Voter in the voting compartment who is viewing the glass from the top can have clear view of the slip for 7 seconds – Marginal tint on the VVPAT glass window, or the fact that the cutting and dropping of the slip from the roll in to the drop box of the printer is not visible, does not violate r.49M – The words ‘before such slips get cut’ in the proviso to r.49M(3) indicate and require that the slip should be cut from the roll after the elector has seen the print through the glass window – Use of glass window prevents damage, smudging, attempt to deface or physically access the VVPAT slip – The rule ensures that the voter is able to see the slip along with the serial number with name of the candidate and the symbol for whom they have voted – Per Dipankar Datta, J.
