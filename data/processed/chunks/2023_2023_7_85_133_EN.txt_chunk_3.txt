Section 115BBE being a subsequent legislation, the true meaning of Section 37(1) can be understood on that basis. [Para 17][106-A-C] H THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX JAIPUR v. PRAKASH 89 CHAND LUNIA (D) THR. LRS. & ANR. 1.4 Conclusions: A I. The word ‘any expenditure’ mentioned in Section 37 of the Act takes in its sweep loss occasioned in the course of business, being incidental to it. II. As a consequence, any loss incurred by way of an B expenditure by an assessee for any purpose which is an offence or which is prohibited by law is not deductible in terms of Explanation 1 to Section 37 of the Act. III. Such an expenditure/loss incurred for any purpose which is an offence shall not be deemed to have been incurred C for the purpose of business or profession or incidental to it, and hence, no deduction can be made. IV. A penalty or a confiscation is a proceeding in rem, and therefore, a loss in pursuance to the same is not available for deduction regardless of the nature of business, as a penalty or confiscation cannot be said to be incidental to any business. D V. The decisions of this Court in Piara Singh and Dr. T.A. Quereshi do not lay down correct law in light of the decision of this Court in Haji Aziz and the insertion of Explanation 1 to Section 37.
