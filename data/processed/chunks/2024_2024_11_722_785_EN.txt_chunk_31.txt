Not providing dignity to prisoners is a relic of the colonizers and pre-colonial mechanisms, where oppressive systems were designed to dehumanize and degrade those under the control of the State. Authoritarian regimes of the pre-constitutional era saw prisons not only as places of confinement but as tools of domination. This Court, focusing on the changed legal framework brought out by the Constitution, has recognized that even prisoners are entitled to the right to dignity… 30 [1979] 1 SCR 512 : (1978) 4 SCC 104 31 [1980] 2 SCR 557 : (1980) 3 SCC 488 32 2024 INSC 753 : [2024] 10 SCR 493 770 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Thus, the jurisprudence which emerges on the rights of prisoners under Article 21 is that even the incarcerated have inherent dignity. They are to be treated in a humanely and without cruelty. Police officers and prison officials cannot take any disproportionate measures against prisoners. The prison system must be considerate of the physical and mental health of prisoners. For instance, if a prisoner suffers from a disability, adequate steps have to be taken to ensure their dignity and to offer support.” 60. It is thus clear that no one can take away the fundamental rights of prisoners or the accused. Incidentally, this Court in the case of Rudul Sah v. State of Bihar and another,33 had an occasion to consider the question as to what happens when the rights of the accused or the prisoners are violated, and he becomes a victim of lawlessness on the part of the State Government which keeps him in illegal detention for over 14 years after his acquittal. While granting monetary compensation to the victim in the said case, this Court observed thus: “One of the telling ways in which the violation of that right can reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the mandate of Article 21 secured, is to mulct its violators in the payment of monetary compensation. Administrative sclerosis leading to flagrant infringements of fundamental rights cannot be corrected by any other method open to the judiciary to adopt. The ·right to compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of instrumentalities which act in the name of public interest and which present for their protection the powers of the State as a shield. If civilisation is not to perish in this country as it has perished in some others too well-known to suffer mention, it is necessary to educate ourselves into accepting that, respect for the rights of individuals is the true bastion of democracy. Therefore, the State must repair the damage done by its officers to the petitioner’s rights. It may have recourse against those officers.” 33 1983 INSC 85 : [1983] 3 SCR 508 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 771 In Re: Directions in The Matter of Demolition of Structures 61. Again in the case of Ankush Maruti Shinde and others v. State of Maharashtra,34 this Court has granted compensation to the accused, who spent 16 years in jail on false implication by the authorities.
