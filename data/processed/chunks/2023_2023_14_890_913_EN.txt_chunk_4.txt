FINDINGS OF THE HIGH COURT 5. It was observed that the homicidal nature of the death is undisputed. In respect of each of the dying declarations, the High Court agreed with the conclusions arrived at by the Trial Court and observed that the appeal was devoid of merits. The High Court’s reasoning per each such declaration is referred to below:- 5.1 DD-I given to PW16 was sought to be challenged on the ground that PW15 had not heard the statement being made. The court noted that in his cross-examination, PW15 had stated that the deceased “might have told the fact that convict-appellant was responsible for the incident”. It was further observed that the driver of such a vehicle, when is focused on taking a patient with serious injuries to the hospital with the siren blaring, it is no surprise that he did not hear what the deceased stated to PW16. 898 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. 5.2 DD-II was made to PW18, which, it has been observed, was entirely in tune with DD-I made to PW16. The concerned doctor has also deposed regarding the deceased’s fi tness when making such a statement. The addition of “by Abhishek” was not found credible by the High Court as PW18 has denied the same, and no reason was found to disbelieve doctors. 5.3 DD-III was made at 3.30 AM to PW17. This statement also names the convict-appellant. It was observed that between 1.40 AM and 3.30 AM, three consecutive statements were given by the deceased, and the time from when she was found in a burnt condition to the registration of an FIR is barely two hours. 5.4 DD-IV was sought to be discredited on the ground that PW5 was an interested witness.
