v. COMMANDING 609 OFFICER & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 4. In April 2014, the appellant again fell ill. This time, he was admitted to Station Medicare Centre, Head Quarter, South West Air Command (U), Gandhinagar. The test report dated 05.03.2014, reported “negative” for the HIV virus. While undergoing treatment at this facility, he suff ered some complications and was consequently, transferred to Military Hospital, Ahmedabad. On further deterioration of his health at the Ahmedabad center, he was further transferred to INHS Asvini, Mumbai, an Indian Naval establishment. While undergoing treatment, his blood samples were taken and on diagnosis, the Lab reports (dated 21.05.2014 and 23.05.2014), revealed that the appellant was suff ering from Human Immunodefi ciency Virus (hereafter, “HIV”). According to the appellant, these two lab reports meet the required parameters for a valid medical document, including mention of the lab reference number and name of the medical offi cer. The fi nding of the lab report returns as: “Positive for HIV – I Antibodies by NACO Strelegy”. 5. The appellant endeavored to trace the source of the virus and realized that the transfusion of virus infected blood at 171 MH Samba in 2002 was the cause of his condition. After the detection of the HIV virus, the fi rst medical board was held on 11.06.2014 and as per the fi ndings of the Medical Board, the infection with HIV was made – “non-attributable to service”. On being dissatisfi ed with the decision of the fi rst Medical Board, the appellant demanded a copy of the documents relating to his blood transfusion at 171 MH, Samba in July 2002; access was however refused by the respondents on account of their unavailability. 6. In February of 2015, the appellant was hospitalized at a military facility in Ahmedabad owing to H1N1 (Swine) Infl uenza, Macrocytic Anaemia, Subhyalodid, and Haemorrhage along with Immune Surveillance. He requested information about his Personal Occurrence Report (POR) at 171 Military Hospital, Samba in 2002 which had to be kept by the Commanding Offi cer of the concerned unit. Pursuant to the request, the fi fth respondent, on 24.09.2014, wrote to the IAF record offi ce, in New Delhi and by letter dated 29.09.2014, the appellant’s medical case sheet was provided to him. The case sheet shows that though on 10.07.2002, one unit of blood was transfused to the appellant, but whether Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test was conducted before infusing the 610 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. blood in the appellant’s body was conspicuously absent from that medical case sheet. 7. Thus, Medical Boards were held on 12.12.2014 and 24.06.2015 and in terms of the medical board proceedings, the appellant’s disability was attributable to service owing transfusion of one unit of blood at 171 Military Hospital on 10th July 2002. His disability and the disability qualifying elements for the purpose of disability pension were also assessed by the medical board @ 30% for two years. By letter dated 22.03.20163, PCDA (P) Allahabad endorsed the fi ndings of the Release Medical Board and agreed with the sanctioned disability pension.
