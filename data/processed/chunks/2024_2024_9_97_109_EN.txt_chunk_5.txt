1 crore. 12. We have heard Shri Vipin Sanghi, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant and Shri Sudhir Kulshreshtha, learned counsel for the ADA in all the three appeals. 13. The facts as recorded above are not disputed. Even the NCDRC did not find any contradiction in the factual aspect. The only issue is as to whether the possession as offered on 04.12.2014 should be taken as a valid offer of possession even if there was no completion certificate and also whether the firefighting clearance certificate was available with the ADA or not. Despite specific requests and demands by the appellant for providing the completion certificate and firefighting clearance, the ADA failed to produce the same. Senior Counsel for the appellant has relied upon the following s in support of his submission that offer for possession would be invalid where the completion certificate and firefighting clearance certificate have not been obtained by the developer i.e. ADA: (a) Debashis Sinha & Ors. vs. R.N.R. Enterprise5 (b) Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited vs. Union of India & Ors.6 (c) Treaty Construction vs. Ruby Tower Cooperative Housing Society Ltd.7 It is then submitted that even before the NCDRC the completion certificate and the firefighting clearance certificate could not be produced by the respondent -ADA. 14. It is also submitted on behalf of the appellant that under the provisions of RERA Act, 2016 as also the UP (Promotion of Apartment and Ownership and Maintenance) Act, 2010 offer of possession would be valid only after a developer obtains the completion certificate, which had not been done so far by the developer ADA in the present case. On behalf of the appellant, it is also argued that the demand 5 (2023) 3 SCC 195 6 [2019] 10 SCR 381 : (2019) 8 SCC 416 7 [2019] 9 SCR 606 : (2019) 8 SCC 157 [2024] 9 S.C.R. 105 Dharmendra Sharma v. Agra Development Authority of Rs. 3,43,178/- along with alleged offer of possession dated 14.02.2014 was totally unjustified and illegal. It was also submitted that the appellant having deposited the amount of approximately Rs. 60 lakhs and that too after taking loan from financial institutions, cannot be deprived of counting the interest from the date of deposit rather than from the date of filing of the complaint. In support of this submission, reliance has been placed upon the following s: (a) Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh8 (b) Rishab Singh Chandel & Anr. vs. Parsvnath Developers Ltd. & Anr.9 (c) Lucknow Development Authority vs. M.K.Gupta10 (d) Marvel Omega Builders Pvt. Ltd. vs. Shri Hari Gokhale & Ors.11 (e) Experion Developers Pvt. Ltd. vs. Sushma Ashok Shierror12 15. On such submissions it was prayed by the appellant that his appeals be allowed and the interest be awarded from the date of deposit and to that extent the impugned and of NCDRC be modified. Further that the appeal filed by the respondent be dismissed. 16. Having considered the submissions of both parties, we are of the opinion that both have contributed to delays at various stages.
