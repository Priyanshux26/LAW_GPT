19. The Scrutiny Committee relied on the in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao (supra), but all we need to say is that the is distinguishable as it was not concerned with the 2012 Rules but was concerned with the circular dated 22.02.1985 issued by the Government of India which indicated that migrants from one state to another will be entitled to derive benefi ts from the state of origin and not from the state to which the individual migrates. This therefore can have no application in the facts of the present appeal. 20. The upshot of the above discussion is that the Scrutiny Committee and the High Court erred in rejecting the appellant’s claim as belonging to the Nomadic Tribe-Lohar. The High Court additionally fell into an error by recording that the appellant’s grand-father Mulchand’s name does not fi gure in the family tree. In consequence, the decision of the Scrutiny Committee dated 06.03.2017 and also the High Court’s impugned dated 18.09.2018 are found to be unsustainable. Looking at the linkage demonstrated with her paternal grandfather who settled in Maharashtra prior to the deemed date i.e., 21.11.1961, the appellant should in our opinion be considered as belonging to the Nomadic Tribe-Lohar. It is declared accordingly. The appeal is allowed with such fi nding. In consequence, since the appellant has completed her education in BDS course from Yogita Dental College and Hospital (respondent no.3), by virtue of the present , her results should now be declared. All consequential reliefs will follow. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Divya Pandey
