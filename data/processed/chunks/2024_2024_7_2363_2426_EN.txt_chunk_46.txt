(c) If questions (a) and (b) are answered in the affirmative, what are the parameters and facts that are to be taken into consideration by the court while examining the question of “need and necessity to arrest”? 68 [2016] 3 SCR 575 : (2016) 4 SCC 346 69 [2015] 9 SCR 99 : (2019) 1 SCC 1 70 [2020] 1 SCR 812 : (2020) 3 SCC 637 71 [2024] 2 SCR 420 : (2024) 5 SCC 1 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2425 Arvind Kejriwal v. Directorate of Enforcement 85. As we are referring the matter to a larger Bench, we have to, despite our findings on “reasons to believe”, consider whether interim bail should be granted to Arvind Kejriwal. Given the fact that right to life and liberty is sacrosanct, and Arvind Kejriwal has suffered incarceration of over 90 days, and that the questions referred to above require in-depth consideration by a larger Bench, we direct that Arvind Kejriwal may be released on interim bail in connection with case ECIR No. HIU-II/14/2022 dated 22.08.2022, on the same terms as imposed vide the dated 10.05.2024 which reads: (a) he shall furnish bail bonds in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Jail Superintendent; (b) he shall not visit the Office of the Chief Minister and the Delhi Secretariat; (c) he shall be bound by the statement made on his behalf that he shall not sign official files unless it is required and necessary for obtaining clearance/approval of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi; (d) he will not make any comment with regard to his role in the present case; and (e) he will not interact with any of the witnesses and/or have access to any official files connected with the case. The interim bail may be extended, or recalled by the larger Bench. 86. We are conscious that Arvind Kejriwal is an elected leader and the Chief Minister of Delhi, a post holding importance and influence. We have also referred to the allegations. While we do not give any direction, since we are doubtful whether the court can direct an elected leader to step down or not function as the Chief Minister or as a Minister, we leave it to Arvind Kejriwal to take a call. Larger Bench, if deemed appropriate, can frame question(s) and decide the conditions that can be imposed by the court in such cases. 87. Accordingly, the Registry is directed to place the matter before the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate Bench, and if appropriate, a Constitution Bench, for consideration of the aforesaid questions. The questions framed above, if required, can be reformulated, substituted and added to. 2426 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 88. The observations made in this are for deciding the present appeal and will not be construed as findings on merits of the case/ allegations. Facts, as alleged, have to be established and proved. Application for regular bail, if pending consideration or required to be decided, shall be decided on its own merits.
