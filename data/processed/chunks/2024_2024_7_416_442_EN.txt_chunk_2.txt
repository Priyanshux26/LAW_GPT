[Para 40] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 419 M/s Daimler Chrysler India Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s Controls & Switchgear Company Ltd. & Anr. Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – s. 2(1)(d) – Consumer – Commercial purpose – Purchase of a vehicle/good by a Company for the use/personal use of its directors, if would amount to purchase for “commercial purpose” within the meaning of s. 2(1)(d) – Determination: Held: Would depend upon facts and circumstances of each case – However ordinarily “commercial purpose” is understood to include manufacturing/industrial activity or business-to-business transactions between commercial entities – Purchase of the goods should have a close and direct nexus with a profit generating activity – It has to be seen whether the dominant intention or dominant purpose for the transaction was to facilitate some kind of profit generation for the purchaser and/or their beneficiary – If it is found that the dominant purpose behind purchasing the goods was for the personal use and consumption was not linked to any commercial activity, it need not be looked into, if such purchase was for the purpose of “generating livelihood by means of self-employment” – Said determination cannot be restricted in a straitjacket formula and has to be decided on case-to-case basis – Furthermore, in a consumer complaint, the onus to prove that the goods were purchased for “commercial purpose” and thus, such goods would fall outside the definition of “consumer” contained in s. 2(1)(d), would be on the opponent-seller and not on the complainant-buyer.
