It is an integral part of human rights. Of course, construction of a dam or a mega project is definitely an attempt to achieve the goal of wholesome development. Such works could very well be treated as integral component for development.” 30.3. The necessity to strike a balance between development and ecology was reiterated by this Court in Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board v. C. Kenchappa (2-Judge Bench)38 wherein it was observed: “61. The priority of developing nations is urgent industrialisation and development. We have reached at a point where it is necessary to strike a golden balance between development and ecology. 38 [2006] Supp. 2 SCR 362 : (2006) 6 SCC 371 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1931 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. 62. The development should be such as it can be sustained by ecology. All this has given rise to the concept of sustainable development. x x x x 67. A nation’s progress largely depends on development, therefore, the development cannot be stopped, but we need to control it rationally. No Government can cope with the problem of environmental repair by itself alone; people’s voluntary participation in environmental management is a must for sustainable development. There is a need to create environmental awareness which may be propagated through formal and informal education. We must scientifically assess the ecological impact of various developmental schemes. To meet the challenge of current environmental issues, the entire globe should be considered the proper arena for environmental adjustment. Unity of mankind is not just a dream of the enlightenment but a biophysical fact.” (Emphasis supplied) 30.4. In Electrosteel Steels Limited v. Union of India and Ors. (2-Judge Bench)39 while dealing with ex-post facto environmental clearances, this Court observed that the Court cannot be oblivious to the economy or others dependent on a project, if the project in question complies with environmental considerations. 30.5. Recently, in NHAI v. Pandarinathan Govindarajulu (3-Judge Bench),40 it was observed: “18. While economic development should not be allowed at the cost of ecology or by causing widespread environmental destruction, the necessity to preserve ecology and environment should not 39 [2021] 14 SCR 863 : (2023) 6 SCC 615 40 (2021) 6 SCC 693 1932 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports hamper economic and other development. Both development and environment must go hand in hand. In other words, there should not be development at the cost of environment and vice versa, but there should be development while taking due care and ensuring the protection of environment [Indian Council For Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India, (1996) 5 SCC 281]. The traditional concept that development and ecology are opposed to each other is no longer acceptable [Vellore Citizens’ Welfare Forum v. Union of India, (1996) 5 SCC 647].” (Emphasis supplied) 30.6. A similar approach was taken in Rajeev Suri v. DDA (3-Judge Bench)41 wherein judicial review of the Central Vista Project was sought. The majority, in this case, observed: “519. Indubitably, environment and development are not sworn enemies of each other.
