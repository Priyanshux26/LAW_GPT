It was pointed out that this important factor is to be kept in mind by the Magistrate while passing the judicial . This Court reiterated that Section 19 of the Act of 2002, supplemented by Section 167 Cr.P.C., provided adequate safeguards to an arrested person as the Magistrate has a distinct role to play when a remand is made of an accused person to an authority under the Act of 2002. It was held that the Magistrate is under a bounden duty to see to it that Section 19 of the Act of 2002 is duly complied with and any failure would entitle the arrestee to get released. It was pointed out that Section 167 Cr.P.C is meant to give eff ect to Section 19 of the Act of 2002 and, therefore, it is for the Magistrate to satisfy himself of its due compliance by perusing the passed by the authority under Section 19(1) of the Act of 2002 and only upon such satisfaction, the Magistrate can consider the request for custody in favour of an authority. To put it otherwise, per this Court, the Magistrate is the appropriate authority who has to be satisfi ed about the compliance with safeguards as mandated under Section 19 of the Act of 2002. In conclusion, this Court summed up that any non-compliance with the mandate of Section 19 of the Act of 2002, would enure to the benefi t of the person arrested and the Court would have power to initiate action under Section 62 of the Act of 2002, for such non- compliance. Signifi cantly, in this case, the grounds of arrest were furnished in writing to the arrested person by the authorized offi cer. 16. In terms of Section 19(3) of the Act of 2002 and the law laid down in the above decisions, Section 167 Cr.P.C. would necessarily have to be complied with once an arrest is made under Section 19 of the Act of 2002. PANKAJ BANSAL v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 729 [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] The Court seized of the exercise under Section 167 Cr.P.C. of remanding the person arrested by the ED under Section 19(1) of the Act of 2002 has a duty to verify and ensure that the conditions in Section 19 are duly satisfi ed and that the arrest is valid and lawful. In the event the Court fails to discharge this duty in right earnest and with the proper perspective, as pointed out hereinbefore, the of remand would have to fail on that ground and the same cannot, by any stretch of imagination, validate an unlawful arrest made under Section 19 of the Act of 2002. 17. In the matter of Madhu Limaye and others3 was a 3-Judge Bench decision of this Court wherein it was observed that it would be necessary for the State to establish that, at the stage of remand, the Magistrate directed detention in jail custody after applying his mind to all relevant matters and if the arrest suff ered on the ground of violation of Article 22(1) of the Constitution, the of remand would not cure the constitutional infi rmities attaching to such arrest.
