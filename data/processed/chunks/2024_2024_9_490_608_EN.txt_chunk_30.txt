The afore-mentioned judicial pronouncements were all prior to 2015 Amendment. Notably, prior to the Amendment, 2015 the expression “in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law” was not used by the legislature in either Section 34(2)(b)(ii) or Section 48(2) (b). The pre-amended Section 34(2)(b)(ii) and its Explanation read: “S.34. Application for setting aside arbitral award— (1) ******* (2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the court only if— ****** (b) the court finds that – ****** (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India. Explanation.-- Without prejudice to the generality of sub- clause (ii) it is hereby declared, for the avoidance of any doubt, that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India if the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81. Whereas pre-amended Section 48(2)(b) and its Explanation read: 37 Paragraph 33 of the in Associate Builders (supra) [2024] 9 S.C.R. 533 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. S. 48. Conditions for enforcement of foreign awards. – (1) ******** (2) Enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the court finds that— (a). ****** (b) the enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of India. Explanation. – Without prejudice to the generality of sub- clause (b) of this section, it is hereby declared, for the avoidance of any doubt, that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India if the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption. 42. By the Amendment, 2015, in place of the old Explanation to Section 34(2)(b)(ii), Explanations 1 and 2 were added to remove any doubt as to when an arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India. 43. At this stage, it would be pertinent to note that we are dealing with a case where the application under Section 34 of the 1996 Act was filed after the Amendment, 2015, therefore the newly substituted/ added Explanations would apply.38 44. The Amendment, 2015 adds two explanations to each of the two sections, namely, Section 34(2)(b)(ii)39 and Section 48(2)(b),40 in place of the earlier Explanation. The significance of the newly inserted Explanation 1 in both the sections is two-fold. First, it does away with the use of words: (a) “without prejudice to the generality of sub-clause (ii)” in the opening part of the pre-amended Explanation to Section 34(2)(b)(ii); and (b) “without prejudice to the generality of clause (b) of this section” in the opening part of the pre-amended Explanation 38 Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd (supra) 39 See footnote 18 40 Section 48(2)(b).-- Explanation 1. — For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India, only if ,-- the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; or it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.
