The position was further clarifi ed in Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. Raja Transport (P) Ltd. [(2009) 8 SCC 520 : (2009) 3 SCC (Civ) 460]. Para 48 of the Report wherein the scope of Section 11 of the Act was summarised may be quoted by reproducing sub-paras (vi) and (vii) hereinbelow: (Indian Oil case [(2009) 8 SCC 520 : (2009) 3 SCC (Civ) 460], SCC p. 537) ‘48. (vi) The Chief Justice or his designate while exercising power under sub-section (6) of Section 11 shall endeavour to give eff ect to the appointment procedure prescribed in the arbitration clause. (vii) If circumstances exist, giving rise to justifi able doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the person nominated, or if other circumstances warrant appointment of an independent arbitrator by ignoring the procedure prescribed, the Chief Justice or his designate may, for reasons to be recorded, ignore the designated arbitrator and appoint someone else.” 8. The above discussion will not be complete without reference to the view of this Court expressed in Union of India v. Singh Builders Syndicate [(2009) 4 SCC 523 : (2009) 2 SCC (Civ) 246], wherein the appointment of a retired Judge contrary to the agreement requiring appointment of specifi ed offi cers was held to be valid on the ground that the arbitration proceedings had not concluded for over a decade making a mockery of the process. In fact, in para 25 of the Report in Singh Builders Syndicate [(2009) 4 SCC 523 : (2009) 2 SCC (Civ) 246] this Court had suggested that the Government, statutory authorities and government companies should consider phasing out arbitration clauses providing for appointment of serving offi cers and encourage professionalism in arbitration. 9. A pronouncement of late in Deep Trading Co. v. Indian Oil Corpn. [(2013) 4 SCC 35 : (2013) 2 SCC (Civ) 449] followed the legal position laid down in Punj Lloyd Ltd. [Punj Lloyd 100 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. Ltd. v. Petronet MHB Ltd., (2006) 2 SCC 638] which in turn had followed a two-Judge Bench decision in Datar Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance Ltd. [(2000) 8 SCC 151]. The theory of forfeiture of the rights of a party under the agreement to appoint its arbitrator once the proceedings under Section 11(6) of the Act had commenced came to be even more formally embedded in Deep Trading Co. [(2013) 4 SCC 35 : (2013) 2 SCC (Civ) 449] subject, of course, to the provisions of Section 11(8), which provision in any event, had been held in Northern Railway Admn. [(2008) 10 SCC 240] not to be mandatory, but only embodying a requirement of keeping the same in view at the time of exercise of jurisdiction under Section 11(6) of the Act.” (emphasis in original) 14. Speedy conclusion of arbitration proceedings hardly needs to be emphasised. It would be of some interest to note that in England also, Modern Arbitration Law on the lines of U਎ਃਉਔ਒ਁ਌ Model Law, came to be enacted in the same year as the Indian law which is known as the English Arbitration Act, 1996 and it became eff ective from 31-1- 1997.
