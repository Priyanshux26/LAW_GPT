VISHAL & ANR. 939 Ms. Richa Kapoor, Kunal Anand, Ms. Tusharika Sharma, Ms. Shisham Pradhan, Advs. for the Respondents. / OF THE SUPREME COURT SANJAY KUMAR, J. 1. Tried and tested many times over, the issue of succession to Mitakshara coparcenary property continues to raise its head time and again like an undying Hydra of Lerna. The case on hand is one such instance. 2. Phannuram Sahu died on 22.06.1959 with surviving interest in Mitakshara coparcenary properties, being agricultural land admeasuring 24.64 acres in Village Dhaneli along with house properties. He left behind Kesar Bai, a daughter born through his fi rst wife, Dukalhin Bai, along with Vishal and Keja Bai, a son and a daughter born through his second wife, Ganga Bai. Both his wives predeceased him. 3. It was the case of Kesar Bai that a partition was eff ected on 12.03.1964 amongst Vishal; Ramnath, Phannuram’s nephew; and Manbat Bai, Phannuram’s sister-in-law. Having received Phannuram’s 1/3rd share in the coparcenary properties, Vishal rejected Kesar Bai’s demand for partition and allotment of her individual share therein. Kesar Bai thereupon instituted a partition suit, which came to be numbered as Civil Suit No. 146A of 1991 on the fi le of the learned First Civil Judge, Division-II, Raipur. Therein, she claimed her share in the coparcenary properties along with mesne profi ts. During the pendency of the suit, Kesar Bai died on 17.06.1988 and her son, Derha Ram, the present appellant, succeeded to her estate under registered will dated 16.12.1980. 4. Upon considering the issues settled for trial and on the strength of the evidence, oral and documentary, the Trial Court decreed the suit on 06.11.1996, holding that Derha was entitled to 1/3rd share in the suit scheduled agricultural land and a 1/3rd share in two house properties. The Trial Court also held him entitled to mesne profi ts @ ₹400 per annum from 1979 till separate possession was delivered to him. 940 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 5. Aggrieved by the Trial Court’s and decree, Vishal and Keja Bai fi led Civil Appeal No. 6A of 1998 before the learned District Judge-III, Raipur. However, by dated 13.04.1999, the Appellate Court dismissed the appeal in toto. 6. The matter was then carried in appeal by Vishal and Keja Bai to the High Court of Chhattisgarh in Second Appeal No. 891 of 1999. By dated 31.03.2009, the High Court partly allowed the second appeal and held that Derha would be entitled to 1/6th share in the suit properties, i.e., the agricultural land and two dwelling houses.
