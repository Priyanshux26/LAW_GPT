This aside, according to us fi xing 01.11.2018 as the cut-off date for determining eligibility qua all conditions can bring about undesirable outcomes. For example, if a candidate had a clean service record, had completed 8 years STATE OF HARYANA AND OTHERS v. DINESH SINGH 1059 AND ANOTHER [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] continuous government service, had no disciplinary proceedings pending or contemplated against him, was clear from the vigilance angle but in between 01.11.2018 and the date of consideration if he were to be facing disciplinary action concerning serious misconduct, such a candidate would remain eligible for selection. It is in this background the communication dated 9th July, 2019 has to be read and understood. 29. The Respondent had relied on letter dated 30.05.2019 to contend that 01.11.2018 was to operate as a cut-off date qua all eligibility conditions. In to deal with this submission, we may have to refer to the contents of the letter dated 30.05.2019 and the letter dated 09.07.2019. 30. The State Government vide letter dated 30.05.2019 showed interest in fi lling up the 23 vacancies of HCS(EB) and in this regard informed the Additional Chief Secretary and Financial Commissioner, requesting him to send a list of eligible candidates as contemplated under Rule 9 Paragraph 2 of this letter stated that the DROs/Tehsildars whose names are to be recommended should fulfi l the eligibility conditions provided for in Rule 9 as on 01.11.2018. What is interesting to note here is that the cut-off date has not been confi ned to apply only to the eligibility criteria pertaining to the age but to all the four criteria uniformly. This letter was followed up by another letter dated 09.07.2019, in which the State Government appears to have reconsidered the matter. According to this letter, the names had to be recommended as per the conditions of eligibility found in the amended Rule 9(1)(a) and (b). It was requested therein that the recommended names be sent to the Committee by 12.07.2019. What we notice here is that the uniform application of the cut-off qua all eligibility conditions was deleted and the cut-off was restricted to the condition relating to the age of the candidate. Thus, the Respondent cannot take umbrage under the contents of letter dated 30.05.2019, when it had been followed up with another letter on the same subject and with specifi c clarifi cation regarding the scope and relevance of the date 01.11.2018. 31. Therefore, it cannot be held that Rule 9 contemplated a uniform cut-off date qua all the conditions of eligibility. 01.11.2018 was relevant only in so far as Rule 9(1)(a)(ii) was considered. For the purpose of Rule 9(1)(a) (iii), the relevant date for determining if there was any disciplinary action contemplated or pending against a candidate “is the date of consideration,” 106 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. which is the date on which the Committee had recommended names to the Commission under Rule 9(2), which, in the facts of this case would be 31.08.2019.
