Such a notice having been served on 4-6-1980, it has to be seen whether the claims were in time as on that date. If the claims were barred on 4-6- 1980, it follows that the claims had to be rejected by the arbitrator on the ground that the claims were barred by limitation. The said period has nothing to do with the period of limitation for fi ling a petition Under Section 8(2) of the Act. Insofar as a petition Under Section 8(2) is concerned, the cause of action would arise when the other party fails to comply with the notice invoking arbitration.” In these circumstances, the state’s arguments are insubstantial and are rejected, with regard to the correct position in law, and the facts of this case. 19. As far as the question of claims not being within the contracted period, i.e., within the 30-day time granted after foreclosure of the contract is concerned, in the opinion of the court, that issue does not arise having regard to the facts. On account of the inordinate delay (which occurred in the decision by the authorities, resulting in fi ve extensions of time by mutual consent), the contractor voluntarily sought foreclosure. That request was acceded to by the department. There is no dispute that originally, the period of completion of the contract/works was eighteen months. The request for foreclosure, therefore, was deemed reasonable by the department and accepted upon receipt of the appellant contractor’s letter dated 06.04.1990. Such being the case, there could have been no objection to delay in submission of the claim for dispute resolution or arbitration – given that the department itself had sat over the request for settlement of disputes for more than 6 years. Moreover, the defect liability period would end only upon both parties expressing satisfaction and recording 376 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. it in an agreed manner or predetermined manner. Concededly, that event never occurred. 20. Another area in which the state had argued and succeeded concurrently was that the award granted compensation in respect of days when water releases were made in the canal that led to disruption in work. The award9 noted that the explanation carved out for the purpose of the work was the period when no work could be carried on during water releases in the canal at the time of the rabi period. The tribunal noted that the work was to be done during the kharif period. Further, the tribunal granted award in respect of three periods, 23.08.1987 to 15.10.1987; 20.07.1988 to 08.08.1988 and 10.03.1989 to 02.07.1989. The tribunal consciously refused to grant damages for the period 28.11.1986 to January 1987, when the canal release took place during the rabi period. It was only in respect of the other three periods when the releases were not during the rabi season and the period beyond the contract that damages or compensation was calculated at diff erential rates, aggregating ₹ 14,18,228/-. 21. This court fi nds no merit in the respondent state’s submission that the record became defective and procedurally the claim became untenable because the tribunal was not informed and the appellant did not bring all heirs of the late SD Shinde on the record.
