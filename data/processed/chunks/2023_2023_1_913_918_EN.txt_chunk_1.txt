have preferred the present appeal. 2. We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length. F 2.1 From the impugned and passed by the High Court, it appears that while passing the impugned and , the High Court has relied upon the earlier decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. Vs. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki and Ors., (2014) 3 SCC 183 and has observed G that though the possession of the land in question was taken over on specific dates mentioned in the returns /counter affidavit but as the compensation was not tendered, the acquisition is deemed to have lapsed. Therefore, even the High Court has also not disputed that the original writ petitioners – original landowners were dispossessed on specific H GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI AND ANR. v. KHAJAN 915 SINGH AND ANR. [M. R. SHAH, J.] dates mentioned in the returns / counter affidavit. Even in the writ petition A also, the original writ petitioners have specifically admitted that they were dispossessed. However, they claimed the lapse of acquisition solely on the ground that the compensation was not paid / tendered relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. (supra), which decision of this Court has been B specifically overruled by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and Ors., (2020) 8 SCC 129. In paragraphs 365 and 366, the Constitution Bench of this Court has observed and held as under:- “365. Resultantly, the decision rendered in Pune C Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183] is hereby overruled and all other decisions in which Pune Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183] has been followed, are also overruled. The decision in Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. [Sree Balaji Nagar D Residential Assn. v. State of T.N., (2015) 3 SCC 353] cannot be said to be laying down good law, is overruled and other decisions following the same are also overruled. In Indore Development Authority v. Shailendra [(2018) 3 SCC 412], the aspect with respect to the proviso to Section 24(2) and whether E “or” has to be read as “nor” or as “and” was not placed for consideration. Therefore, that decision too cannot prevail, in the light of the discussion in the present . 366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under: F 366.1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on 1-1-2014, the date of commencement of the 2013 Act, there is no lapse of proceedings. Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of the 2013 Act. G 366.2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding the period covered by an interim of the court, then proceedings shall continue as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the 2013 Act under the 1894 Act as if it has not been repealed.
