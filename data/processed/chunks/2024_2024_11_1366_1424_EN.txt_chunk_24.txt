The said directed that the Government should identify the category of persons who may form a new Cooperative Society, get the same registered and make an application as a group for the purpose of allotment of land in terms of the policy contained in GoM Nos. 242 and 243 dated 28.02.2005. It further ruled that all allotments must be in accordance with the stipulations in GoM Nos. 242, 243 and 244. Further, the Court observed that the Government would be well advised to incorporate a condition of inapplicability of the policy to those who own a house [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1401 State of Andhra Pradesh and Others v. Dr. Rao, V.B.J. Chelikani and Others or housing site in their own name, or in the name of their spouse or children, so as to make it applicable to all future allotments. We would like to quote the relevant paragraphs from the : “In the result, the writ petition is allowed and G.O.Ms. No.522, dated 04.5.2006 is quashed insofar as it provides for allotment of land to individuals, who are not members of the societies/groups and who may have received the benefit of concessional allotment from the government earlier or as member of any society or group to which concessional allotment was made. G.O.Ms.No.1424, dated 28.9.2006 whereby the land has been earmarked for respondent No.4 is declared to be in consonance with the policy contained in G.O.Ms.No.243, dated 28.2.2005 subject to the rider that all the restrictions contained in that G.O. will apply to the allotment of land by respondent No.4 to its members. The government will also do well to incorporate an additional restriction against the allotment of land to those who own house or house-site in their own name or in the name of their spouse or children and make the same applicable to the allotment made to respondent No.4 and all future allotments, which may be made in accordance with the policy enshrined in G.0.Ms.Nos.242 and 243 dated 28.2.2005. However, it is made clear that this of ours will not preclude the government from making allotment to societies or groups of the identified categories in accordance with the policy contained in G.O.Ms.No.243, dated 28.2.2005 and it will be open to the identified categories of persons to form new society and get the same registered or make applications as groups for the purpose of allotment of land in terms of the policy contained in G.O.Ms.No.243, dated 28.2.2005. Before parting with the case, we consider it necessary to mention that the provision contained in the impugned G.O. for processing of the applications of the individual High Court Judges by the sub-committee comprising Advocate General, Secretary, Legal Affairs and Registrar General, A.P. High Court, with senior-most among them 1402 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports being its Chairman had the pernicious effect of demeaning the status of the members of the superior judiciary and seriously eroding the confidence of the common man in the system of administration of justice because, then the individual Judges would have been required to make applications for allotment of land to the government and their applications would have been processed by a committee comprising two officers who are constitutionally subordinate to the High Court.
