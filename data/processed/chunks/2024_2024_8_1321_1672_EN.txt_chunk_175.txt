He observed that this was done since they are admittedly included within the backward classes. However, [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1567 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. in paragraph 803, he specifically observed that under Article 16(4) there is no mention of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are also part of backward class of citizens. 232. Insofar as the observation in paragraph 792 wherein Jeevan Reddy, J. observed that the said discussion has no relevance in the case of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes is concerned, the said discussion was regarding applicability of the ‘means test’ or ‘creamy layer test’. 233. That being the case, if the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are a part of backward class of citizens under Article 16(4), then the question would be, as to why sub-classification which is permitted in case of Other Backward Classes cannot be permitted in case of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes? 234. Though the initial view of this Court was that Article 16(4) is by way of exception to Article 16(1), the same has undergone a thorough change, particularly after the of this Court in the case of His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalavaru vs. State of Kerala 24 in relation to interplay between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles. Shortly after the in Kesavananda Bharati, came the of 7-Judge Bench of this Court in N.M. Thomas wherein the 5-Learned Judges took a view that Article 16(4) was not by way of exception to Article 16(1). It was held that the trinity of Articles 14 to 16 embodied the concept of equality. It was emphasized that equality does not mean equality to all. It was held that equality as enshrined under the Constitution did not mean formal equality but real equality. It was held that to bring real equality unequal treatment to unequals was what was contemplated under the Constitution. It was held that if unequals are to be treated equally it will lead to nothing else but perpetuating inequality. It was held that only giving an unequal treatment to unequals so that they can march ahead can bring out real equality. 235. This Court in unequivocal terms held that preferential treatment for members of backward classes alone can mean equality of opportunity for all citizens. The Court held that clause (4) of Article 16 was an emphatic way of stating a principle implicit in Article 16(1). 24 [1973] Supp. SCR 1 : (1973) 4 SCC 225 1568 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 236. Ray, C.J. observed that all legitimate methods were available for equality of opportunity in services under Article 16(1). He stated that Article 16(4) indicates one of the methods of achieving equality embodied in Article 16(1) 237. Mathew, J. observed that the claim for equality is in fact a protest against unjust, underserved and unjustified inequalities. It is a symbol of man’s revolt against chance, fortuitous disparity, unjust power and crystallized privileges. He stated that if equality of opportunity guaranteed under Article 16(1) means effective material equality, then Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1).
