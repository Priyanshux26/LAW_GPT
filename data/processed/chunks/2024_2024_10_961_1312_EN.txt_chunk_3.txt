(Concurring) s.6A not violative of Arts. 6 and 7, which prescribe cut-off date for conferring citizenship for migrants from East and West Pakistan at the commencement of the Constitution-26.01.1950 – s.6A confers citizenship from 01.01.1966 for those who migrated before that date – Those who migrated between 01.01.1966 and 24.03.1971, [2024] 10 S.C.R. 965 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 are conferred citizenship upon the completion of ten years from the date of detection as a foreigner – s.6A confers citizenship from a later date to those who are not covered by Arts. 6 and 7, thus, does not have the effect of amending Arts. 6 and 7 – Art. 11 is not a non-obstante clause – Legislative competence of Parliament to enact laws related to citizenship is traceable to Entry 17 List I and not Art. 11 – Provisions in Part II do not impact or limit the legislative competence of Parliament. [Paras 38, 42, 125] – Held: (per Pardiwala, J.) (Dissenting): s.6A is not similar in form and identical in spirit with Arts. 6 and 7 – Perusal of s.6A vis-à-vis Arts 6 and 7 respectively would reveal that despite a few similarities between the two, the crucial difference lies in the fact that in Art. 6, the onus of registration for a person seeking citizenship lies on that person and not on the State – All those persons who migrated to India from Pakistan after 19.07.1948, had to make an application before the commencement of the Constitution – Permit system which was introduced as per Art. 7 was also brought to an end in 1952 – Both these conditions-onus of registration as well as the specification of a cut-off date till which such applications could have been made are absent from the very scheme of s.6A – This glaring absence renders the scheme of s.6A arbitrary and as a result unconstitutional. [Para 212] s.6A vis-à-vis Art. 14 Citizenship Act, 1955 – s.6A – Special provisions as to citizenship of persons covered by the Assam Accord – Constitution of India – Art.14 – s.6A vis-à-vis Art. 14 – s.6A, if creates an unreasonable classification which violates Art.14 – Plea that s.6A falls foul of Art.14 as it treats equals unequally; and that the selective application of s.6A solely to the State of Assam exhibits hostility against it in comparison to other states: Held: (per Surya Kant, J.) (for himself and for M.M. Sundresh and Manoj Misra, JJ.) Since s.6A was predicated on the terms of the Assam Accord, it extended citizenship solely to immigrants in Assam because the Union of India had exclusively engaged in this accord with Assam – This serves as the basis of intelligible differentia vis-à-vis other States – s.6A duly considered the pertinent factors, notably that the Assam Accord pertained solely to the State of Assam – Since a piquant situation such as that in Assam did not exist in any of the other States, s.6A’s objective 966 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
