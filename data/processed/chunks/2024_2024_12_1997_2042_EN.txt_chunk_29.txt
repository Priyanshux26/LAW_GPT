To do so, the Court may invoke the Doctrine of Severability and sever the incurable parts of the contract from the whole. The Court can do so only when the rest of the contract can breathe and survive without the aid of its void covenants. The Court must ask itself whether the parties would have agreed to the valid terms of the agreement if they knew that the invalid terms would be removed.22 Given the extent of manipulation in the instant case, we must intervene and hold that Article 14 of the Concession Agreement, read with the formula in Annexure F, is opposed to public policy and must be cut apart from the Concession Agreement. G.5. Recovery of Total Project Cost and returns thereon by NTBCL 79. It is pertinent to note that NTBCL has consistently claimed that the Total Project Cost and returns thereon have not been recovered so far. This claim is the primary reason that the extension of the concession period has come under scrutiny. In contrast, Respondent No. 1 asserts that the project costs and reasonable profits have long been recovered by NTBCL, thereby negating the need to continue imposing user fees/tolls. 20 Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly, (1986) 3 SCC 156. 21 Rattan Chand Hira Chand v. Askar Nawaz Jung, (1991) 3 SCC 67. 22 Beed District Central Coop. Bank Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, (2006) 8 SCC 514. 2038 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 80. The High Court has categorically held that NTBCL was not entitled to recover any amount over and above what had already been received by it. This was determined on the following basis: (i) The project cost incurred for the Delhi-NOIDA Bridge and Ashram Flyover was Rupees 377 crores. (ii) The cost of construction, as submitted by the Project Engineer, was Rupees 188.3 crores but was disclosed as Rupees 265.7 crores. (iii) The cost of construction of the Ashram Flyover was Rupees 20 crores and was included in the Project cost even though it was the subject matter of a separate construction agreement. (iv) The gross income for the year ending on 31.03.2014 was Rupees 810.18 crores, as per NTBCL. The surplus after tax was Rupees 578.80 crores (not including income from other sources). (v) The Statement of Computation of Returns and Arrears dated 14.09.2015 (filed by NTBCL) revealed that the gross revenues earned by NTBCL have been increasing gradually each year. (vi) The income from advertisement and rent is not included in the Statement of Computation. (vii) The user fees collected between 01.04.2014 and 30.09.2016 would tally to an additional sum of approximately Rupees 300 crores. (viii) NTBCL even started giving dividends to its shareholders to the extent of 5% in 2010-2011, 10% in 2011-2012, 10% in 2012- 2013, and 25% in 2013-2014. This meant that NTBCL had earned sufficient profits from the revenue generated via the user fees. The Project could thus be handed over to NOIDA even before the expiry of the concession period, i.e.
