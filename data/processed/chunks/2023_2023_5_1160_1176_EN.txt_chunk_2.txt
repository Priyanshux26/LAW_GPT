With technological advances, the country’s judiciary and tribunals must F move towards e-filing. This process has already commenced and is irreversible. The Union Government must have a fresh look at the rules to encourage e-filing across tribunals. Perhaps one way forward would be to constitute a Working Group to make a comprehensive assessment of the position across tribunals and G suggest regulatory changes. Moreover, it is utterly incomprehensible why NCLAT should insist on physical filing in addition to e-filing. This unnecessarily burdens litigants and the Bar and is a disincentive for e-filing. A lawyer or litigant who is compelled to file physical copies in addition to e-filed documents will have no cogent reason to resort to e-filing. This duplication H of effort is time consuming. It adds to expense. It leaves behind SANKET KUMAR AGARWAL & ANR v. APG LOGISTICS PVT. 1163 LTD. a carbon footprint which is difficult to efface. The judicial process A has traditionally been guzzling paper. This model is not environmentally sustainable. If some judges are uncomfortable with e-files, the answer is to provide training to them and not to continue with old and outmoded ways of working. The judiciary has to modernize and adapt to technology. The tribunals can be B no exception. This can no longer be a matter of choice. The IBC is a significant prong in economic reforms. It has radically reshaped the law relating to insolvency and bankruptcy. The manner in which the law is administered will have to keep pace with technology. Both the Union government in its rule making capacity and the administrative heads of tribunals must ensure a C seamless transition to working in the electronic mode.
