No prejudice has been caused to the applicants even assuming that the guideline was not in the public domain. It was a procedure adopted by the recruiting Authority and endorsed by the Selection Committee. The appellants have had the opportunity to assail the validity of the prescription of the award of bonus marks and as such have had a fora to ventilate their grievance. They have failed in the [2024] 7 S.C.R. 217 Mahesh Chand Bareth & Anr. v. State of Rajasthan & Ors. process. Hence, we cannot jettison the guideline on the alleged ground that it was not in public domain. Equally, since the guidelines of 27.05.2008 preceded the advertisement of 31.05.2008, there is no merit in the argument feebly advanced that the rules of the game had been changed after the match had begun. 40. On the special facts of this case, considering the peculiarity that obtained in the State of Rajasthan with regard to absentee teachers and drop out of students and the introduction of the projects with para legals to address the situation, we find no illegality in the prescription of additional marks for those applicants who had experience of working in projects, while recruiting Prabhodhaks. The statutory rules itself in Rule 13(v) recognize that project employed applicants were a class apart and the idea being that their experience should not be wasted. In view of the above, we find no illegality in the award of bonus marks. 41. In view of the above, we find no merit in the appeals and all the appeals are dismissed with no as to costs. All applications for impleadment and intervention are closed. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
