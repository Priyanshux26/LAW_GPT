E does not qualify as unitary consumption is 1.67% only, i.e. less than 1.96% per 1% shareholding and the same does not fall within 10% variation. Excluding E, the shareholding held by A, B, C and Others 9.25 64 - D is 33% i.e. not less than 26%. Hence A, B, C and D qualify as Captive users. The disqualifi cation of E will not affect A, B, D and D as they cumulatively consume more than 51% and hold 33% i.e. not less than 26%.
