By the time, the Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar, passed an extending the time, the period of 90 days had already expired. Indisputably, there was no chargesheet before the Court on the 91st day i.e., on G 07.09.2019. The reason why this is said to be a grey area is because what would have happened if the appellants had preferred an application seeking statutory/default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC on the 91st day i.e., on 07.09.2019. The application seeking extension of time was very much pending. The Additional Sessions Judge could not have even allowed such application H 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A promptly i.e., on or before the 90th day without giving notice to the accused persons. [Para 76][52-F-H; 53-A-C] 3.2 An opportunity of hearing has to be given to the accused persons before the time is extended up to 180 days to complete the investigation. The only error or lapse on the part of the B appellants was that they failed to prefer an appropriate application seeking statutory/default bail on the 91st day. If such application would have been filed, the court would have had no option but to release them on statutory/default bail. The Court could not have said that since the extension application was pending, it shall pass an appropriate only after the extension application C was decided. That again would have been something contrary to the well settled position of law. This litigation is an eye opener for the NIA as well as the State investigating agency that if they want to seek extension, they must be careful that such extension is not prayed for at the last moment. [Para 76][53-C-E] D 3.3 The right to be released on default bail continues to remain enforceable if the accused has applied for such bail, notwithstanding pendency of the bail application or subsequent filing of the chargesheet or a report seeking extension of time by the prosecution before the court. However, where the accused E fails to apply for default bail when the right accrues to him, and subsequently a chargesheet, or a report seeking extension of time is preferred before the Magistrate or any other competent court, the right to default bail would be extinguished. The court would be at liberty to take cognizance of the case or grant further time for completion of the investigation, as the case may be, F though the accused may still be released on bail under other provisions of the CrPC.
