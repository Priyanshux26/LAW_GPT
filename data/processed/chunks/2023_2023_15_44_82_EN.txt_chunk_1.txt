in C.A. No.4152 of 2022. [Paras 74, 86 (i)] Civil Services Examination Rules, 2022 – Benefi ts under the EWS Category – Cut-off date for eligibility prescribed – Justifi cation: Held: The UPSC was justifi ed in prescribing the cut-off date for possession and for uploading of the I&AC in the prescribed format for claimants claiming benefi ts under the EWS Category – This fl ows from the O.M. dtd. 19.01.2019 & 31.01.2019 r/w rr.13, 27(3) and 28 of the CSE-Rules, 2022 and the long line of s in which principles for prescription of cut-off for eligibility are laid down – Service Law. [Para 86 (ii)] Civil Services Examination Rules, 2022 – Validity: Held: The CSE-2022 Rules have the force of an enforceable law – They are traceable to the All India Services Act, 1951 r/w the Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954 r/w the Indian Administrative Service (Appointment by Competitive Examination) Regulations, 1955 and all this r/w Article 73 of the Constitution of India – The CSE Rules do not in any manner supplant any of the provisions of the All India Service Act or the IAS Recruitment Rules or the IAS (Appointment by Competitive Examination) Regulations – They only supplement them – While the manner of conduct of examinations is clearly traceable to Regulation 3, it is untenable to say that since Regulation 4 in the conditions of eligibility does not prescribe 46 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. EWS category and EWS certifi cation and hence they do not qualify as part of eligibility – The EWS category itself came in 2019 – If this contention was to be right, then there could be no EWS category at all in CSE-2022 – Hence, the contention that rr.13, 27 and 28 of the CSE-Rules, 2022 cannot be given a status of rules cannot be countenanced – Additionally, these are rules traceable to the executive power of the Union which are duly traceable to Article 73 – These rules are duly gazetted and are set out well before the selection process begins and candidates are put to notice before the commencement of the process – It is too late in the day to contend that these rules have no sanctity or the force of an enforceable law– All India Services Act, 1951 – Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954 – Indian Administrative Service (Appointment by Competitive Examination) Regulations, 1955 – Constitution of India – Article 73. [Paras 49, 50, 86(iii)] Civil Services Examination Rules, 2022 – rr.13, 27(3) and 28 – Plea to declare the said Rules to be ultra vires Article 14 to the extent it prescribes that candidate must be in possession of a EWS certifi cate as on the closing date of the application for preliminary examination: Held: Rejected – There is no case made out to show that the cut-off of 22.02.2022 was picked out of the hat – That was the last date for submission of the application and it was a validly prescribed cut-off – Where there is absence of any rule or absence of any prescription, the last day for fulfi lling the eligibility is the last date of submission of the application – This is a judicially recognized default date – In this case the last date for fi ling of the application was prescribed as the cut-off in the Rules – rr.13, 27(3) and 28 are constitutionally valid – Constitution of India – Article 14 – Service Law.
