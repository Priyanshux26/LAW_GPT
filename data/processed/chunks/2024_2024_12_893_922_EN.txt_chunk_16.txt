It was pointed out that fiscal statutes are framed at a point of time but are meant to apply for significant periods of time thereafter and they cannot, therefore, be expected to keep up with nuances and niceties. It was held that the terms of the statutes must be adapted to developments of contemporary times rather than being held entirely inapplicable and it is for this precise reason that Courts apply the ‘common parlance test’ every time parties attempt to differentiate their products on the basis of subtle and finer characteristics. 37. Earlier, in Alpine Industries vs. Collector of Central Excise, New Delhi,7 this Court observed that, in interpreting tariff entries in taxation statues like the Excise Act, where the primary object is to raise revenue and, for that purpose, various products are differently classified, the entries must not be understood in their scientific/ technical sense and must be construed as per their popular meaning, i.e., the meaning that would be attached to them by those using the product. However, as already noted above, this exercise would be undertaken when a product is not clearly defined or specifically dealt with in the headings in the First Schedule to the Act of 1985 and the corresponding HSN entries. 38. Long prior thereto, in Indo International Industries vs. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Uttar Pradesh,8 this Court held that any term or 6 [2012] 11 SCR 365 : (2012) 13 SCC 639 7 [2003] 1 SCR 313 : (2003) 3 SCC 111 8 [1981] 3 SCR 294 : (1981) 2 SCC 528 918 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports expression defined in a taxing statute must be understood in the light of the definitions given in the Act, in the absence of which the meaning of the term as understood in common parlance or commercial parlance must be adopted. 39. It is also to be noted that Rule 1 of the General Rules of Interpretation in the First Schedule to the Act of 1985 must be applied in the first instance and only if classification cannot be determined thereunder, recourse would have to be taken to the other Rules specified in the General Rules. Once the determination can be made under Rule 1, the question of applying other tests relatable to the other rules would not arise. In consequence, when there is no ambiguity or confusion about the classification of a particular product in the light of the clear heading in the First Schedule to the Act of 1985 and the corresponding entry in the HSN, resort to tools such as the ‘common parlance test’ would not arise. 40. Presently, it is an admitted fact that pure coconut oil is suitable for multiple uses. That notwithstanding, when a specific heading was created in Chapter 15, viz., Heading 1513, for ‘coconut oil’ along with other oils, it would not stand excluded therefrom so as to be classified as a cosmetic product under Heading 3305 in Chapter 33 in Section VI of the First Schedule, unless all the conditions required therefor are satisfied.
