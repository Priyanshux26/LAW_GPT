Act, even on an application u/s. 319 CrPC, without first following the requirements of s. 19 – On facts, the correct procedure should have been for the prosecution to obtain sanction u/s. 19 from the appropriate Government, before formally moving an application before the Court u/s. 319 CrPC – In fact, the trial court too should have insisted on the prior sanction, which it did not – In absence of the sanction the entire procedure remains flawed – Thus, the impugned passed by the High Court does not call for interference – ss. 7, 11, 13 and 15 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 319.
