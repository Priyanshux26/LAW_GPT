Under Article 16 there can be a reasonable classification of the employees in matters relating to employment or appointment. 22. This Court in State of Gujarat v. Shri Ambica Mills Ltd., Ahmedabad [(1974) 4 SCC 656 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 381] said: [SCC p. 675: SCC (L&S) p. 400, para 53] “The equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws. But laws may classify. And the very idea of classification is that of inequality. In tackling this paradox the Court has neither abandoned the demand for equality nor denied the legislative right to classify. It has taken a middle course. It has resolved the contradictory demands of legislative specialization and constitutional generality by a doctrine of reasonable classification. (See Joseph Tussman and Jacobusten Brook, The Equal Protection of the Laws, 37 California Rev. 341. )” 6 [1976] 1 SCR 906 : (1976) 2 SCC 310 1480 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 23. In Ambica Mills case [(1974) 4 SCC 656 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 381] this Court explained reasonable classification to be one which includes all who are similarly situated and none who are not. The question as to who are similarly situated has been answered by stating that one must look beyond the classification to the purpose of law. “The purpose of a law may be either the elimination of a public mischief or the achievement of some positive public good.” [SCC p. 675: SCC (L&S) p. 400, para 54] 24. Discrimination is the essence of classification. Equality is violated if it rests on unreasonable basis. The concept of equality has an inherent limitation arising from the very nature of the constitutional guarantee. Those who are similarly circumstanced are entitled to an equal treatment. Equality is amongst equals. Classification is, therefore, to be founded on substantial differences which distinguish persons grouped together from those left out of the groups and such differential attributes must bear a just and rational relation to the object sought to be achieved. xxx xxx xxx 27. There is no denial of equality of opportunity unless the person who complains of discrimination is equally situated with the person or persons who are alleged to have been favoured. Article 16(1) does not bar a reasonable classification of employees or reasonable tests for their selection (State of Mysore v. V.P. Narasing Rao [AIR 1968 SC 349 : (1968) 1 SCR 407 : (1968) 2 LLJ 120]). 28. This equality of opportunity need not be confused with absolute equality. Article 16(1) does not prohibit the prescription of reasonable rules for selection to any employment or appointment to any office. In regard to employment, like other terms and conditions associated with and incidental to it, the promotion to a selection post is also included in the matters relating to employment and even in regard to such a promotion to a selection post all that Article 16(1) guarantees is equality of opportunity to all citizens. Articles 16(1) and (2) give effect to equality [2024] 8 S.C.R.
