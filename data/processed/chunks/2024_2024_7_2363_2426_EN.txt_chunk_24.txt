Reference in this [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2395 Arvind Kejriwal v. Directorate of Enforcement regard was made to The King Emperor v. Khawaja Nazir Ahmad,34 Dukhishyam Benupani, Asst. Director, Enforcement Directorate (FERA) v. Arun Kumar Bajoria,35 State of Bihar and another v. J.A.C. Saldanha and others,36 and M.C. Abraham and another v. State of Maharashtra and others.37 In our opinion, these decisions do not apply to the present controversy, as the power of arrest in this case is governed by Section 19(1) of the PML Act. These decisions restrict the courts from interfering with the statutory right of the police to investigate, provided that no legal provisions are violated. Investigation and crime detection vests in the authorities by statute, albeit, these powers differ from the Court’s authority to adjudicate and determine whether an arrest complies with constitutional and statutory provisions. As indicated above, the power to arrest without a warrant for cognizable offences is exercised by the police officer in terms of Section 41 of the Code.38 Arrest under Section 41 can be made on the grounds mentioned in clauses (a) to (i) of Section 41(1) of the Code, which include a reasonable complaint, credible information or reasonable suspicion that a person has committed an offence, or the arrest is necessary for proper investigation of the offence, etc. The grounds mentioned in Section 41 are different from the juridical preconditions for exercise of power of arrest under Section 19(1) of the PML Act. Section 19(1) conditions are more rigid and restrictive. As such, the two provisions cannot be equated. The legislature has deliberately avoided reference to the grounds mentioned in Section 41 and considered it appropriate to impose strict and stringent conditions that act as a safeguard. The same reasoning will apply to the contention raised by the DoE relying upon the provisions of Section 437 of the Code and the of this Court in Gurcharan Singh and others v. State (Delhi Administration).39 Section 437 of the Code applies when an accused suspected of committing a non-bailable offence is arrested or detained without warrant by a police officer in charge of a police station or is brought before a court, other than the High Court or the Court of Sessions. It is 34 AIR 1945 PC 18 35 [1997] Supp. 5 SCR 566 : (1998) 1 SCC 52 36 [1980] 2 SCR 16 : (1980) 1 SCC 554 37 [2002] Supp. 5 SCR 677 : (2003) 2 SCC 649 38 Refer footnote 18 above. 39 [1978] 2 SCR 358 : (1978) 1 SCC 118 2396 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports observed that the accused would be released on bail, except for in cases specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 437(1) of the Code. Section 437(1)(i) applies at the stage of initial investigation where a person has been arrested for an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life. Section 437(1)(ii) imposes certain fetters on the power of granting bail in specified cases when the offence is cognizable and the accused has been previously convicted with death, imprisonment for life, or 7 years or more, or has previously been convicted on two or more occasions for non-bailable and cognizable offences.
