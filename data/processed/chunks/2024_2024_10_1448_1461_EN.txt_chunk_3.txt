It is submitted that putting such a condition confers arbitrary power on the State Government to cancel the remission . Hence, the condition violates Article 21 of the Constitution of India. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1453 Mafabhai Motibhai Sagar v. State of Gujarat & Ors. 7. Regarding condition no.2, the learned senior counsel submitted that even if a false allegation is made against the appellant of commission of any cognizable offence, he will be deprived of remission granted under the dated 15th September 2023. The learned senior counsel relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Shaikh Abdul Azees v. State of Karnataka.1 While dealing with sub-section (3) of Section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (for short, ‘the CrPC of 1898’) which is pari materia with Section 432 of the CrPC, this Court held that on breach of any of the conditions on which remission is granted, there is no automatic revival of the sentence. He submitted that both conditions are completely illegal. 8. Ms Swati Ghildiyal, the learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent-State of Gujarat, submitted that under sub-section (1) of Section 432 of the CrPC, the appropriate Government has the power to remit the whole or any part of the punishment subject to certain conditions. The provision requires the convict to accept the said conditions, without which he cannot be granted the benefit of remission. The learned counsel submitted that it is very well settled that a convict is not entitled to remission of the sentence as a matter of right. She submitted that the limited right of the convict is only to be considered for remission as held by this Court in the case of Union of India v. V. Sriharan alias Murugan & Ors.2 The learned counsel also relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Epuru Sudhakar & Anr. v. Govt. of A.P. & Ors.,3 which lays down that the power to remit sentence is a discretionary power which has to be exercised on public interest considerations. The learned counsel submitted that the appellant has accepted the conditions imposed on him and has furnished surety in terms of condition no.1. Hence, no interference is called for.
