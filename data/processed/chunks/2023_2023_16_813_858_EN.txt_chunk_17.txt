protection of interest of students in Private Educational Institutions and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. (iv) Further, vide letter dated 23.05.2017, the Director of Higher Education provided a list of Institutes recognised by the Takniki Board. Even RTI noting records that vide letter dated 14.06.2017 the Director, Technical Education had provided details of all such institutes. Thus, there was neither any ambiguity in the 2014 Rules nor any doubt about the recognised institutes. Hence, no relaxation / clarifi cation was required. (v) The relaxation dated 21.08.2017 was a colourable exercise of powers to push forward a list of unrecognised institutes having support of powerful lobbies. (vi) Impugned relaxation being after the last date fi xed for receipt of the application is in teeth of the law settled by this Court in Rakesh Kumar Sharma vs. State (NCT of Delhi) & Ors14. That apart, in absence of power reserved in the advertisement to relax the eligibility criteria, and there being no publicity of such relaxation, relaxation of the eligibility criteria falls foul of the law laid down by this Court in Bedanga Talukdar vs. Saifudaullah Khan15 and Sanjay K. Dixit v. State of U.P.16 (vii) Further, a candidate by self-declaration cannot certify his own qualifi cation as equivalent to the one specifi ed. There have to be norms and guidelines for declaring a qualifi cation equivalent to meet the eligibility criteria prescribed by the Rules for the post. However, the Committee approved the candidature / selection of candidates on the basis of self-certifi cation which is impermissible in light of this Court’s decision in Mukul Kumar Tyagi vs. State of U.P.17 14 (2013) 11 SCC 58 15 (2011) 12 SCC 85 16 (2019) 17 SCC 373 17 (2020) 4 SCC 86 ANKITA THAKUR & ORS. v. THE H.P. STAFF SELECTION 843 COMMISSION & ORS. [MANOJ MISRA, J.] (viii) As relaxation of eligibility criteria was illegal, extension of the same relaxation for Post Code 556 is also illegal. Otherwise also, executive instructions cannot override statutory rules framed under Article 309 of the Constitution of India. In this regard, reliance was placed on decisions of this Court in Krishna Rai v. Banaras Hindu University18; Union of India vs Somasundaram Viswanath & Ors.19; and P.D. Aggarwal & Ors. vs. State of U.P. & Ors.20. 16. Ms. Vandana Sehgal, who appeared on behalf of appellants in the appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.17676 of 2022, submitted that the third advertisement for Post Code 817 was published on 21.09.2020. By that time Himachal Pradesh, Department of Personnel, Junior Offi ce Assistant (Information Technology), Class III (Non-Gazetted) Ministerial Services, Common Recruitment and Promotion Rules, 202021 were already notifi ed. Thus, recruitment had to be as per the 2020 Rules. The third advertisement also applied the same 2020 Rules; therefore, recruitment could not have been in terms of the 2014 Rules. Thus, relaxation under the 2014 Rules could not have been used to fi ll up posts advertised under the third advertisement. Therefore, High Court’s direction to segregate the posts that were carried forward from the second advertisement and hold recruitment under the old Rules was completely misconceived.
