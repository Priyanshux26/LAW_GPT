[Paras 109-113] Limitation Act, 1963 – s. 18 – Limitation extended by acknowledgement – By virtue of acknowledgment, if any, the claimant, if entitled to extension of the period of limitation: Held: s. 18 deals with the effect of acknowledgement in writing – Sub-section (1) thereof provides that where, before the expiration of the prescribed period for a suit or application in respect of any right, an acknowledgement of liability in respect of such right has been made in writing signed by the party against whom such right is claimed, a fresh period of limitation to be computed from the time when the acknowledgment was so signed – Explanation to s. 18 provides that an acknowledgment may be sufficient though it omits to specify the exact nature of the right or avers that the time for payment has not yet come or is accompanied by a refusal to pay, or is coupled with a claim to set off, or is addressed to a person other than a person entitled to the right – On facts, the limitation period started to run from 19 March 2016 – Within three years therefrom, in the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018 there was a clear acknowledgement that the amount claimed by the claimant is the balance amount payable, though subject to debit, by way of set off, against various claims made by the appellant upon the claimant – Such an acknowledgment was sufficient to extend the limitation period as it admitted the existing liability of the appellants qua the balance amount payable to the claimant under the contract – Benefit of such an acknowledgement would not be lost merely because a set off is claimed – Thus, minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018, though claims a set off, is a valid acknowledgement of the existing liability within the ambit of s. 18 and it extends the period of limitation for a period of 3 years from the date it was made – Thus, the claim made on 2 May 2019, within the period of limitation. [Paras 116, 119] [2024] 9 S.C.R. 495 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s. 23 (2A) – Counter claim – Nature of – Counterclaim in respect of cost of repair/ replacement of gear box and fan modules, if barred by time: Held: Counterclaim is a claim made by a defendant in a suit against the plaintiff – It is a claim, independent of and separable from the plaintiff’s claim, which can be enforced by a cross action – Counterclaim preferred by the defendant in a suit is a cross suit and even if the suit is dismissed, counterclaim shall remain alive for adjudication – Purpose of the scheme relating to counterclaim is to avoid multiplicity of proceedings – s. 23 (2A) gives respondent to a claim a right to submit a counterclaim or plead a set off, which shall be adjudicated upon by the arbitral tribunal, if such counterclaim or set off falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement – Counterclaim is like a cross suit, or a separate suit, and the limitation of a counterclaim is to be counted from the date of accrual of the cause of action which it seeks to espouse – As a logical corollary thereof, it is quite possible that even though a suit or a claim is within the period of limitation, the counterclaim may well be barred by limitation, if the cause of action espoused therein accrued beyond the prescribed period of limitation – On facts, the counterclaim in respect of cost of repair/replacement of gear box and fan modules, barred by time – Tribunal took 21 September 2015 as the start point of limitation for the counterclaim on the premise that it would be the date when the Takeover Certificate is deemed to have been issued, the supplier had fulfilled its obligations – On basis thereof, the tribunal found counterclaims as regards cost of repair/replacement of gear boxes and of fan modules barred by time as the counterclaim was filed on 15 July 2019 i.e., more than three years later, and there existed no acknowledgement in respect thereof – However, for other issue, 19 March 2016 is found as the start point of limitation for the claim because that is the date when 180 days period of guaranteed performance, part of supplier’s liability, expired – Whether the limitation period is counted from 21 September 2015 or 19 March 2016, the counterclaim filed on 15 July 2019 was beyond the prescribed period of three years inasmuch as its cause of action could not have arisen after 19 March 2016.
