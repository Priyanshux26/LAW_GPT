One must be mindful of the fact that discipline is the implicit hallmark of the Armed Forces and a non-negotiable condition of service. [Paras 9 and D 10][1204-H; 1205-D-E] 4. It is apparent from a bare reading of the provision which deals with offences relating to absence without leave, that in case of an offence of overstaying leave without sufficient cause, on a conviction by a Court Martial, punishment by way of imprisonment E for a term that may extend to three years or such less punishment as contemplated in the Act can be imposed on the delinquent person. Section 71 that falls under Chapter VII of the Act deals with punishments that may be inflicted for offences on conviction by the Court Martial, listed in a sliding scale. The punishment of imprisonment finds mention at sub-clause (c) whereas that of F dismissal from service is mentioned down below, in sub-clause (e). In other words, the punishment of dismissal from service on conviction by Court Martial has been treated as a lesser punishment vis-à-vis the punishment of imprisonment for any period below 14 years. That being the position, the appellant G cannot be heard to state that the punishment inflicted on him is graver than the one contemplated under the Act. [Para 12][1206- E-G] 5. For the aforesaid reasons, this Court do not find any infirmity in the impugned passed by the AFT. The appellant had been taking too many liberties during his service H EX SEPOY MADAN PRASAD v. UNION OF INDIA AND 1201 OTHERS and despite several punishments awarded to him earlier, ranging A from imposition of fine to rigorous imprisonment, he did not mend his ways. This was his sixth infraction for the very same offence. Therefore, he did not deserve any leniency by infliction of a punishment lesser than that which has been awarded to him.
