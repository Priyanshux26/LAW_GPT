It is not in dispute that at the time when the Special Court took cognizance of the offence the sanctions under the UAPA and the 1908 Act had already been granted. [Para 72][51-D-E; F-H] E 2.3 The error on the part of the investigating agency in filing chargesheet first before the Court of Magistrate has nothing to do with the right of the accused to seek statutory/default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC. The committal proceedings are not warranted, when it comes to prosecution under the UAPA by the NIA by virtue of Section 16 NIA Act. This is because the Special F Court acts, as one of the original jurisdictions. By virtue of Section 16 NIA Act, the Court need not follow the requirements of Section 193 CrPC.

State of Punjab and Another 2021 SCC OnLine P&H 786 – referred to. 3.1 The final report under Section 173(2) of the CrPC was D filed in the Court of SDJM on 15.11.2019, was the 161st day from the date of arrest of two of the appellants. They were the first to be arrested on 08.06.2019. The Punjab Police applied to the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar, for extension of time to complete the investigation invoking the E proviso to Section 43D(2)(b) of the UAPA on 04.09.2019. When this application for extension of time was filed only two days were left for 90 days to expire. This is suggestive of the fact that the 91st day would have fallen on 07.09.2019. What is important to highlight is that the Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar, looked into the extension application dated 04.09.2019 filed by the Punjab F Police and ultimately, extended the time limit vide its dated 17.09.2019 i.e., on the 101st day.
