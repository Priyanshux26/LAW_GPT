Section 141 of the Bombay Municipal Act is clearly not such a provision. The second contention fails and is F repelled.” 100. Counsel for the Electric Utilities have not referred to any provision in the plenary legislation of the 2003 Act by which electricity dues would constitute a charge on the premises. The provisions of the 1910 Act, 1948 Act, and the 2003 Act do not provide that the arrears of G electricity dues would constitute a charge on the property or that such a charge shall be enforceable against a transferee without notice.It is pertinent to note that this Court has reiterated that arrears of electricity cannot become a charge or encumbrance over the premises, in the H K. C. NINAN v. KERALA STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD & 697 ORS. [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] absence of an express provision of law in the 1910 Act, 1948 Act or A 2003 Act.49 101. In Isha Marbles (supra), this Court observed that under the provisions of 1910 Act read with 1948 Act, electricity arrears do not create a charge over the property. It observed: B “56. From the above it is clear that the High Court has chosen to construe Section 24 of the Electricity Act correctly. There is no charge over the property. Where that premises comes to be owned or occupied by the auction-purchaser, when such purchaser seeks supply of electric energy he cannot be called upon to clear the past arrears as a condition C precedent to supply. What matters is the contract entered into by the erstwhile consumer with the Board. The Board cannot seek the enforcement of contractual liability against the third party. Of course, the bona fides of the sale may not be relevant.” D 102. Similarly, in Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (supra), this Court held that in the absence of any contract to the contrary, the amount payable towards supply of electricity does not constitute a charge on the premises. 103. Consequently, in general law, a transferee of the premises E cannot be made liable for the outstanding dues of the previous owner since electricity arrears do not automatically become a charge over the premises. Such an action is permissible only where the statutory conditions of supply authorise the recovery of outstanding electricity dues from a subsequent purchaser claiming fresh connection of electricity, or if there is an express provision of law providing for creation of a F statutory charge upon the transferee. 104. The next issue which falls for consideration is whether an electricity charge can be introduced by way of statutory regulations or rules enacted by a regulatory commission under its rule making power in the 2003 Act.
