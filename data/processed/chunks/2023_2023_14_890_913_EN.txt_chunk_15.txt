These factors and the fact that the crime in question occurred at an open public access place cast doubt on the prosecution case. 35. Considering the aforementioned factors, placing the gauntlet of guilt upon the convict-appellant based on dying declarations when no other material particulars, apart from his name, could be elicited therefrom would be unjustifi ed. Furthermore, when considering other circumstances that may or may not point to the guilt of the convict-appellant, as discussed above, we fi nd gaps unexplained in the prosecution case, which cast suffi cient doubt as to leave the case short of the threshold of beyond reasonable doubt. 36. Consequently, the Appeal is allowed. The bail granted to the convict-appellant vide dated 21.10.2013 is confi rmed, and the bail bonds stand discharged. 37. Interlocutory Applications, if any, stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Ankit Gyan
