In the circumstances, the Civil Appeals are accordingly dismissed.” [Emphasis supplied] 17. Subsequently, an application seeking clarification of the above was also filed before this Court, which was dismissed as withdrawn for being not maintainable vide dated 08.07.2011. We may, however, clarify that the details of such an application are neither part of the record of this appeal nor a copy of it was tendered by learned counsel for the parties. 18. Nevertheless, and in compliance to this Court’s dated 08.12.2010, the Appellant-State issued Government dated 14.07.2011 (modified on 15.07.2011) (hereinafter, ‘2011 ’), whereby 1031 posts of ‘Block Education Officer’ were created by merging 1360 posts of SDI/ABSA and 157 posts of DBSA, with the sanctioned pay scale of 7500-12000, to be given with effect from 01.01.2006 notionally, with actual benefits accruing from 01.12.2008. The Second Round of Litigation 19. It is pertinent at this stage to provide some insight into the background in which the Respondents instituted parallel proceedings before the High Court during the pendency of the First Round of Litigation. In to avoid repetition and for the purposes of the present proceedings, we propose to refer the factual matrix pertaining to Respondent No. 1 only since Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 are similarly placed. 20. Respondent No. 1 was initially appointed to the post of Assistant Teacher in a Primary School on 16.11.1971. He was subsequently promoted to Assistant Teacher, Junior High School on 12.01.1977 and thereafter as Headmaster, Junior High School on 05.07.1982. Subsequently, Respondent No. 1 was appointed as the Sub-Deputy 1332 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Inspector of Schools within the aforementioned 10% promotion quota through selection from the post of Headmaster in accordance with the 1992 Rules, vide the dated 19.03.1997. Consequently, he was placed in the pay scale of 4800-7650 and was receiving a monthly salary of Rs. 6000/-. However, with the revision of the pay scale of Headmasters to 7500-12000 with effect from 01.07.2001, Respondent No. 1 was inadvertently placed in the revised higher pay scale instead of what he was entitled to for the post of SDI/ABSA. Respondent No.1 eventually retired as a Sub-Deputy Inspector on 31.07.2004 upon reaching the age of superannuation. 21. Though Respondent No. 1, after his retirement, was paid his provident fund dues, his pension and gratuity amounts were withheld on the premise that while working as a Sub-Deputy Inspector, he was erroneously paid salary in a higher pay scale sanctioned for the post of Headmaster of Junior High School. This was followed by recovery s dated 07.12.2005 and 26.06.2007, directing to adjust the excess amount paid to Respondent No. 1 from his retiral dues. He was further directed to deposit the excess amount within one week, failing which the same would be adjusted from his retiral dues. Respondent No. 1 preferred Writ-A No. 35611/2007 (hereinafter, ‘2007 Writ’) before the High Court, seeking quashing of the abovementioned recovery s and further sought a direction to the State to pay the entire pension along with arrears calculated at the last pay drawn by him along with 24% interest on the delayed payment, and also to release the remaining 10% of the gratuity amount along with interest from the date it became due.
