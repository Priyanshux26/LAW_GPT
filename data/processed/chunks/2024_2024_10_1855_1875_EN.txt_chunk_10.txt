Abdul Shakoor, father of Zahoor Ahmed was very much alive in the year 1922. He had died some time in the year 1930. It was clear that the lease was taken jointly by Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad and not as a joint family property by the two persons. That apart, the concept of joint family property prevalent amongst the Hindus was unknown to the Muslims. Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad were the only lessees of the said land. High Court held that the lower authorities had misdirected themselves by considering acquisition of the said property by Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad as joint acquisition on behalf of the entire family. The source of acquisition of the said property was the lease deed dated 07.05.1922 and in the revenue records, names of the respondents and of Zahoor Ahmed were recorded. The only dispute was with regard to the extent of their respective shares. The authorities below had proceeded to allot 1/2 share to Zahoor Ahmed on the premise that it was a joint family property. According to the High Court, the said approach was not legally tenable. The revisional authority was also not justified in importing principles of Hindu law while determining the shares of the parties who were admittedly Mohammedans. Accordingly, it was held that appellants would get 1/12 share in the land comprised in the lease deed and not half (1/2) as was decided by the authorities below. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1869 Nisar Ahmad & Ors. v. Sami Ullah (Dead) Through Lrs. & Anr. 14.10. In that view of the matter, High Court held that the appellants would have 1/12 share in the plots comprised in Khata Nos. 98 and 99 excluding plot Nos. 35, 37, 111 and 112 which exclusively belonged to the respondents. 14.11. That being the position, Writ Petition No. 18 of 1975 was allowed. 15. Thus, against the dismissal of Civil Misc Writ Petition No. 6635 of 1974 and partly allowing of Writ Petition No. 18 of 1975, the related special leave petitions were filed. 16. This being the factual scenario, let us now have a brief survey of the 1953 Act. The Uttar Pradesh Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 (already referred to as ‘the 1953 Act’) is an Act to provide for the consolidation of agricultural holdings in Uttar Pradesh for the development of agriculture. The statement of objects and reasons of the 1953 Act is as under: After the enforcement of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, there was naturally a pressing demand for the consolidation of holdings in the State. Since the complicated and numerous types of tenures, both proprietary and cultivatory, the greatest stumbling blocks in the way of successful consolidation of holdings, have been abolished it is an opportune time to start this work. The advantages of having in compact blocks all the land farmed by one family need only be briefly mentioned. Boundary lines should be reduced in “number and extent, saving land and diminishing boundary disputes, larger fields would be possible and time saved in making trips to the fields.
