The Forest Department, Government of Goa, Respondent No.4, submitted that in the case of Shivananda Salgaonkar (supra), the High Court of Bombay, Goa Bench, in the judgement delivered on 27th November 1990 held that “since the term ‘forest’ is not defined in the Forest (Conservation) Act, the term has to be taken as per the dictionary meaning”. Pursuant to this judgement, the forest department framed guidelines in 1991, for identifying the forest in private properties. These guidelines were submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), Government of India on 04.10.1991 for their response. 23.

The Committee was given task to identify areas which are ‘forest’ irrespective of whether they are so notified, recognized or classified under any law and irrespective of ownership of land of such forest and to identify areas which were earlier forests but stand degraded, denuded or cleared. 24. Since no cut off was given for the tasks, Committee decided 1980 year in which the Forest Act was promulgated, to be the benchmark for Government forest lands. Subsequently, another Expert Committee was appointed on 4th September, 2000 for further identification of private forest, which also submitted its report on 16.02.2002. 25.
