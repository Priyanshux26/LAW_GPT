In Union of India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan,78 this Court held that though the catch-up rule is not implicit in Article 16, it is a constitutionally valid practice 73 [1962] 2 SCR 586 [Justice Wanchoo, 35]; [Justice Ayyangar, 41] 74 AIR 1968 SC 507 75 AIR 1968 SC 507 [9] 76 (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [Justice Reddy, 827, 828]; [Justice Thommen,302]; [Justice Sawant,552] 77 The service rule by which the general category retains their seniority is called the catch-up rule. The service rule by the seniority is measured based on the feeder pool is called consequential seniority. 78 [1995] Supp. 4 SCR 158 : (1995) 6 SCC 684 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1369 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. to maintain “efficiency”.79 This was reiterated in Ajit Singh (I) v. State of Punjab.80 Justice NP Singh, writing for the three-Judge Bench observed that the process of appointments must balance both Article 16(4) and Article 335 and that the “principal object of a promotion system is to secure the best possible incumbents for the higher position”.81 Subsequently, Parliament amended Article 16(4-A) by the Constitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act 2001 to overcome a series of s of this Court where the rule of consequential seniority in reservation was held to result in reverse-discrimination. Article 16(4-A), as amended by the Constitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act 2001, enables the State to provide reservation in promotion with consequential seniority. 58. In Indra Sawhney (supra), Justice Jeevan Reddy writing for four Judges observed that relaxation of qualifying marks in promotion would result in inefficiency of administration. This position was reiterated by a two-Judge Bench in S Vinod Kumar v. Union of India.82 A proviso was included in Article 335 by the Constitution (Eighty-second) Amendment Act 2000 to overcome this aspect of the ruling in Indra Sawhney (supra) and Vinod Kumar (supra). The proviso provides that Article 335 does not prevent the State from relaxing the qualifying marks in any examination for reservation in promotion. 59. The method for calculating the permissible total percentage of reservation was another issue in which the “efficiency of administration” was used to limit the scope of reservation. This Court had held in Balaji (supra) and Indra Sawhney (supra) that reservation must not exceed 50 per cent. The State was faced with a peculiar situation where a sufficient number of persons from the reserved category was not available to fill the seats reserved for them. The issue was whether the unfilled seats of the reserved category could be carried over to the next year, and whether the carried forward vacancies could be counted while calculating the total percentage of reserved seats in that year. 79 Also see Ajit Singh (II) v. State of Punjab (1999) 7 SCC 209 80 (1996) 2 SCC 715; “it cannot be overlooked that at the first promotion from the basic grade, there was no occasion to examine their merit and suitability for the purpose of promotion.” 81 (1996) 2 SCC 715 [15] 82 [1996] Supp.
