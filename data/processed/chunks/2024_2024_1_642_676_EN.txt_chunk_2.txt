The perennial question in income tax jurisprudence, whether reopening of a concluded assessment i.e. reassessment under Section 147 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (briefly “the Act” hereinafter) following issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act is legally sustainable or is bad in law, is again confronting us in the present batch of appeals. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Cochin Bench, Cochin (‘Tribunal’ hereinafter) had decided in favour of the assessee 646 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports by setting aside the s of reassessment. However, the High Court of Kerala in appeals filed by the revenue under Section 260A of the Act has reversed the findings of the Tribunal by deciding the appeals preferred by the revenue in its favour. 2. Aggrieved by the aforesaid s passed by the High Court of Kerala (briefly “the High Court” hereinafter), the assessee had preferred special leave petitions to appeal before this Court and on leave being granted, civil appeals have been registered. 3. We have heard Mr. Raghenth Basant, learned counsel for the appellant/assessee (which would be referred to either as the appellant or as the assessee) and Mr. Shyam Gopal, learned counsel for the respondent/revenue (again, would be referred to either as the respondent or as the revenue). 4. A brief narration of facts is necessary. 5. For the sake of convenience, we may refer to civil appeal Nos. 8580, 8581 and 8582 of 2011 (M/s Mangalam Publications, Kottayam Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Kottayam). 6. The above three civil appeals pertain to assessment years 1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93. 7. The assessee was a partnership firm at the relevant point of time though it got itself registered as a company since the assessment year 1994-95. The assessee is carrying on the business of publishing newspaper, weeklies and other periodicals in several languages under the brand name “Mangalam”. Prior to the assessment year 1994-95 including the assessment years under consideration, the status of the assessee was that of a firm, being regularly assessed to income tax.
