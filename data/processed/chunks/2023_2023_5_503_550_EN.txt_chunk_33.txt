In paragraph 21 of the said decision, the Constitution Bench held that though s passed under Sections 8 and 9 of the Delimitation Act, 2002 in accordance with sub-Section (1) of Section 10 are not part of an act of the Parliament H 548 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A but its effect would be the same. In any event, the of the Delimitation Commission has not been questioned in this petition. 39. We may note here that there is a great deal of substance in the argument of the learned Solicitor General that the challenge to the notification dated 6th March 2020 was belatedly made by filing the present B petition on 28th March 2022 and for the said delay, there is no valid explanation. Moreover, the notification dated 6th March 2020 was substantially acted upon by completing the exercise of delimitation as the draft was also published on 14th March 2022. 40. In the writ petition, the first prayer is for challenging the increase C in number of seats from 107 to 114. The said provision is made by sub- Section (1) of Section 60. Without challenging the legality of any of the provisions of the J&K Reorganisation Act, it is contended that the Act of increasing the number of seats is violative of Articles 81, 82, 170, 330 and 332 of the Constitution of India. Article 81 deals with the composition of the House of the People; Article 82 deals with the readjustment and D allocation of seats of the House of Parliament after the census and Article 170 deals with legislatures of the States. None of these provisions deal with the Legislature of any Union territory. Article 330 deals with the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the House of the People. Article 332 deals with the reservation of seats E for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assemblies of the States. Both these provisions do not deal with reservation of seats for the House of legislature of Union Territories. In any case, even assuming that Article 332 can be applied to the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Legislatures of Union territories, it is not shown how the act of increasing the total number of F seats in the legislature will offend Article 332, so long as the reservation is maintained as per the formula provided under Article 332. 41. Another argument sought to be made is that the provision made for 114 seats in the legislature of the newly constituted Union Territory of J & K is illegal. This submission calls for no consideration as G there is no challenge to the validity of sub-section (1) of Section 60 of the J&K Reorganisation Act. 42. Another argument was canvassed that the Delimitation of 2008 published by the Election Commission cannot be deviated from. The perusal of the said shows that it reproduces the delimitation H HAJI ABDUL GANI KHAN & ANR. v. UNION OF INDIA & 549 ORS.
