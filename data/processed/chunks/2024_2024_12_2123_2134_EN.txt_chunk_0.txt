[2024] 12 S.C.R. 2123 : 2024 INSC 1049 Daliben Valjibhai & Ors. v. Prajapati Kodarbhai Kachrabhai & Anr. (Civil Appeal No. 14293 of 2024 ) 11 December 2024 [Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Manoj Misra, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether a suit for cancellation of a registered sale deed, filed within three years from the date of knowledge as alleged in the plaint, can be dismissed at the threshold under 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, on the ground that it is barred by limitation. Headnotes† Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (“CPC”) – 7 Rule 11 – In 2017, appellants/ plaintiffs filed a suit for cancellation of alleged registered sale deed dated 04.12.2004 on grounds of fraud – Trial Court dismissed suit under 7 Rule 11 CPC on the ground of limitation – First Appellate Court reversed the decision – In second appeal, High Court reinstated Trial Court’s decision – challenged – Appeal allowed – High Court not justified in allowing the application under 7 Rule 11 on issues not evident from the plaint averments – High Court has drawn inferences that were only possible after a trial – of First Appellate Court restored – Trial Court to take up suit and dispose it of as expeditiously as possible: Held: In 2017, appellants/plaintiffs instituted a suit for cancellation of alleged registered sale deed dated 04.12.2004 conveying the plaint scheduled property in favour of the respondents/ defendants – It was alleged that sale deed was fraudulently obtained and the appellants/plaintiffs came to know of it only on 31.03.2017, when the Deputy Collector issued notice on defendant’s application for correcting revenue entries – Respondents/defendants filed application for rejection of plaint under 7 Rule 11 CPC claiming that suit was barred by 2124 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports limitation – Trial Court allowed application under 7 Rule 11 and dismissed suit as barred by limitation – First Appellate Court reversed the decision holding that limitation is a mixed question of law and fact, and plaintiffs had alleged they became aware of the fraud only in 2017 – Only relevant material for disposing application under 7 Rule 11 are facts mentioned in the plaint, not defendants’ contentions – The High Court vide impugned reinstated Trial Court’s decision holding that the suit was barred by limitation and the plaint did not include essential particulars of alleged fraud – Appeal against impugned allowed – Held, High Court drew inferences possible only after trial even while recording the principle that operation and impact of 7 Rule 11, being a drastic remedy, Courts must adhere to the discipline of confining their scrutiny to the plaint averments – High Court carried away by the fact that the suit was filed 13 years after the execution of sale deed – No justification for allowing the application under 7 Rule 11 on issues that were not evident from the plaint averments. Reliance placed on P.V. Guru Raj Reddy v. P. Neeradha Reddy – Only if the averments in plaint ex facie do not disclose a cause of action or on a reading thereof the suit appears to be barred under any law the plaint can be rejected – At the stage of consideration of the application under 7 Rule 11, the stand of the defendants in the written statement would be altogether irrelevant.
