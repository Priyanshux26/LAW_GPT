of A.P. [(2002) 2 SCC 188] , SCC paras 13 to 24.) Therefore, the D High Court again went wrong by invoking the principle of “promissory estoppel” to allow the petition filed by the respondents herein.” TUKARAM KANA JOSHI AND OTHERS V.MAHARASHTRA INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND OTHERS46 E 91. In the said case, the land of the appellants was taken over by the agents of the State. Compensation, despite repeated requests, was not made available. This Court held: “11.

Most of these authorities F pertain to service jurisprudence, grant of compensation for a wrong done to them decades ago, recovery of statutory dues, claim for educational facilities and other categories of similar cases, etc. Though, it is true that there are a few authorities that lay down that delay and laches debar a citizen from seeking remedy, even G if his fundamental right has been violated, under Article 32 or 226 of the Constitution, the case at hand deals with a different scenario altogether.

To further clarify this position, it must be noted that the authorities have treated the landowner as a “subject” of medieval India, but not as a “citizen” under our Constitution.” D 92.
