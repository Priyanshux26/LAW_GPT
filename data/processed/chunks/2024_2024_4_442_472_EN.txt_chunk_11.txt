22. The learned Counsel for the Respondent No. 02 further contends that the scope of Section 50 of the NDPS Act 1985 is limited to the search on the person of an individual and does not include adherence to the search made on any premise(s). Reliance is placed on State of Himachal Pradesh v. Pawan Kumar (2005) 4 SCC 350 wherein it was held that presence of a Gazetted Officer is required only at the time of the search which is on the person and is not applicable during search of premises. To bolster this argument, it is submitted that the said interpretation fits into the reading of Section 42 of the NDPS Act 1985 as Section 42(1)(a) of the NDPS Act 1985 comprehends search of a building or conveyance or place while Section 42(1)(d) of the NDPS Act 1985 contemplates for search of a person. 23. Apropos, the presumption pertaining to the recovery of contraband, the learned Counsel for the Respondent No. 02, submits that once the recovery of the contraband has been made from the 458 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports possession of an individual, there arises a rebuttable presumption as per Section 54 of the NDPS Act 1985 that the said individual has committed an offence under the NDPS Act 1985. To further build this contention, the learned Counsel has brought our attention to the decision in Madan Lal v. State of Himachal Pradesh (2003) 7 SCC 465 whereby at paragraph numbers 22 to 26 of the , it was has been laid down that the aforesaid possession of contraband includes constructive possession and it need not be only an actual possession of the contraband. On the basis of these above recorded submissions, he prays for dismissal of the instant appeals. 24. Before we delve into the factual analysis based on the legal principles and jurisprudence existing in each contention, it is pertinent to refer to the heart and soul of the Constitution of India, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as “Constitution of India”) – Article 21 – necessitates a just and fair trial to be a humane and fundamental right and actions of the prosecution as well as the authorities concerned within the meaning of the NDPS Act 1985 must be towards ensuring of upholding of the rights of the accused in to allow to have a fair trial. The harmonious balance between the Latin maxims salus populi suprema lex (the safety of the people is the supreme law) and salus republicae suprema lex (safety of the State is the supreme law) is not only crucial and pertinent but lies at the core of the doctrine that welfare of an individual must yield to that of the community subject to the State being right, just, and fair as was iterated in the decision of Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 US 436. 25. The NDPS Act 1985 being a special law with the purpose to curtail the drug menace in the republic necessitated the comprehensive control in favour of the authorities.
