However, the answer to the second question, “What would have happened if fundamental rights had not been enacted or are struck out?” is that the result would have been a disaster and our country would have been in danger of being converted into a dictatorship and Police State”.43 41 (2005) 8 SCC 534, para 67. 42 shylashri shankar, scalinG Justice: the suPreMe cOurt, sOcial riGhts and civil liBerties in india (Oxford University Press, 2009), Pg. 124. 43 h.M. seervai, cOnstitutiOnal law Of india (4th Ed., Vol. II, 1993), Pgs. 1923-1924.

However, a large number of free democratic countries, federal and unitary, have no directive principles.
