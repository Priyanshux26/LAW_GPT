Such report disclosed that the construction of the proposed building had progressed only up to the 1st floor and obviously, therefore, the 2nd and the 3rd floors were still not in existence. From such status report, it is therefore clear that neither was the floor which the complainants intended to purchase is complete nor the floors in respect whereof the appellant F could exercise his rights were in existence. 16. A strikingfeature of the case is that although the appellant through his counsel had undertaken to deposit a sum of Rs. 22,00,000/- (Rupees twenty-two lakh) with the trial court, the FIR version is that the appellant had received separate cheques in his name for a total amount G of Rs.17,00,000/- (Rupees seventeen lakh) [Rs. 5,00,000/- (Rupees five lakh) on 20th December, 2018, Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees two lakh) on 28th December, 2018, Rs. 4,00,000/- (Rupees four lakh) on 28th December, 2018, Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh) on 28th December, 2018, and 1 (2009) 4 SCC 45 H RAMESH KUMAR v. THE STATE OF NCT OF DELHI 1173 [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five lakh) on 21st February, 2019]. That the A appellant had received through cheques a total amount of Rs.17,00,000/ - (Rupees seventeen lakh) was also noticed by the Presiding Officer while dismissing the appellant’s application by the dated 18th January, 2022. However, there can be no doubt that counsel on behalf of the appellant had submitted before the High Court that he was ready to B deposit a sum Rs. 22,00,000/- (Rupees twenty-two lakh), which prima facie happens to be in excess of what the appellant is alleged to have received from the complainants by cheques drawn in his favour on the instructions of the builder. We are not concerned at this stage with alleged payments made by the complainants to the builder. C 17. Legality of the impugned condition is what we are now tasked to examine and decide. 18. It would be appropriate at this stage to note certain precedents in the field governing the discretion of the courts to grant anticipatory bail. D 19. We start with Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia and others vs. State of Punjab2, a Constitution Bench decision of this Court. It was held there as follows: “26. We find a great deal of substance in Mr Tarkunde’s submission that since denial of bail amounts to deprivation of personal liberty, E the court should lean against the imposition of unnecessary restrictions on the scope of Section 438, especially when no such restrictions have been imposed by the legislature in the terms of that section. Section 438 is a procedural provision which is concerned with the personal liberty of the individual, who is entitled to the benefit of the presumption of innocence since he is not, on F the date of his application for anticipatory bail, convicted of the offence in respect of which he seeks bail. An over-generous infusion of constraints and conditions which are not to be found in Section 438 can make its provisions constitutionally vulnerable since the right to personal freedom cannot be made to depend on G compliance with unreasonable restrictions.
