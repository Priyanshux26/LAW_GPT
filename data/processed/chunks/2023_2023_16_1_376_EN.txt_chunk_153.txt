The President was empowered to exercise this power by issuing a public notification. The proviso to this provision provides that the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the State shall be necessary before the President issues such a notifi cation. The term “this article” in clause (3) refers to Article 370. Clause (3), therefore, provides for the manner in which the application of Article 370 to the State of Jammu and Kashmir can be amended or abrogated. 362. Article 370(1)(d) provides that “such of the other provisions” of the Constitution shall apply to the State of Jammu and Kashmir as the President may by specify. The fi rst proviso requires the President to issue an which relates to the matters specifi ed in the IoA referred to in Article 370(1)(b)(i) in consultation with the State Government. The second 256 (2007) 3 SCC 184 257 Ibid at paragraph 27. 258 Subject to the sovereign power of the nation to acquire or cede territories, as recognized in In re Berubari Union’s case (supra). IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 217 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] proviso requires the President to issue s which relate to matters other than those specifi ed in the IoA with the concurrence of the State Government. The term “other provisions” indicates that the procedure laid down by Article 370(1)(d) applies to provisions other than the ones indicated in sub-clauses (a) to (c) of clause (1) of Article 370. 363. From this standpoint of Article 370, the following position on the application of the Constitution to the State of Jammu and Kashmir emerges: a. Article 238 (before it was repealed) did not apply to the State; b. Article 1 applies to the State. Its application can neither be modifi ed nor amended nor can it cease to operate; c. Article 370 applied to the State. Its application could be modifi ed or amended or it could cease to be operative by the issuance of a public notifi cation in accordance with the procedure prescribed by clause (3) of Article 370; and d. The provisions of the Constitution, other than Articles 1, 238 (before it was repealed), and 370 shall apply to the State as specifi ed by the President by way of s, with any exceptions and modifi cations. The procedure contemplated by Article 370(1) (d) must be followed in this case. 364. At this juncture, it is crucial to understand the diff erence between Article 370(1)(a), Article 370(1)(c) and Article 370(1)(d). Article 370 (1) (a) stipulates that the provisions of Article 238 shall not apply to Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370(1)(c) provides that Article 1 and Article 370 shall apply to Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370(1)(d) lays down the procedure by which any “other” provision of the Constitution can be modifi ed or amended in its application to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The expression “other” will exclude Articles 1, 238, and 370. Hence, recourse must be had to the procedure contemplated by Article 370(3) if Article 370 is to cease to operate or is to be amended or modifi ed in its application to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.
