It all depends on the facts of the case. In a given case, a delay of two years may not be fatal. In another case, a delay of six months can be a ground to commute sentence. The terms “undue” or “inordinate” cannot be interpreted by applying the rules of mathematics. The Courts, in such cases, deal with human issues and the effect of the delay on a particular convict. What delay is inordinate must depend on the facts of the case. For example, if a convict is more than seventy years old and is suffering from multiple ailments, an unexplained delay of even six months in deciding a mercy petition can amount to a violation of Article 21. Ultimately, the Courts will have to determine the effect of delay in the light of the principles laid down as aforesaid, considering the facts of the case before it. APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES TO THE FACTS OF THE CASE 29. In this case, there is a delay in the following three stages: i. On 10th July 2015, the convicts filed mercy petitions addressed to the Hon’ble Governor of the State of Maharashtra, which were rejected on 29th March 2016. This is the first part of the delay; ii. On 11th June 2016, mercy petitions were addressed by the convicts to the Hon’ble President of India, which were rejected on 26th May 2017. This is the second part of the delay, and iii. The third part of the delay started on 19th June 2017, when the Superintendent of Prison informed the learned Sessions Judge, Pune, about the rejection of mercy petitions by the Hon’ble President of India. Ultimately, it was only on 10th April 2019 that the learned Sessions Court, Pune, issued the warrants for the execution of the death sentence. Thus, from 10th July 2015 till 10th April 2019, time was consumed in deciding the mercy petitions filed before the Hon’ble Governor of the State and the Hon’ble President of India, and in issuing warrants for executing the death sentence. 600 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
