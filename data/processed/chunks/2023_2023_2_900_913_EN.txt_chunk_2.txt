The H ASHOK RAM PARHAD & ORS. v. THE STATE OF 903 MAHARASHTRA & ORS. Government resolutions issued by the Administrative A Department cannot have the status of a statutory rule although such resolutions may have their own effect. The High Court’s view is the correct view. The resolutions have been passed in the context that the person who successfully completes the training effectively gets the monetary compensation for his training B period and is not deprived of the same. This cannot amount to giving seniority from the date of initial recruitment process to determine inter se seniority, when the Proviso to Rule 2 of the 1984 Rules makes the date of appointment for direct recruits clear. This is also in the background that while the direct appointees have no experience in the field having been freshly C recruited, the promotees have been doing the task. In the present case, the very factum of Proviso to Rule 2 of the 1984 Rules being inserted in the rule has to be assigned a meaning, as otherwise, it would imply that the Proviso has become otiose. It cannot be said that the Proviso is not to be read in the context of D the aspect of promotion. Rules 3B and 6 of the 1988 Rules also leave no ambiguity in this behalf and in fact read in consonance and the period of probation has to be necessarily excluded from period of service. The grant of monetary benefit is a different aspect. On having come to the conclusion that the Government resolutions cannot override statutory rules, and the resolutions E neither speaking about promotion to the post of DFO nor about seniority conclusively, the Proviso would operate with full force. The applicable Rules leave no ambiguity in the matter and must prevail. [Paras 26-32][912-C-H; 913-A, C-F] R. S. Ajara & Ors. v. State of Gujarat (1997) 3 SCC F 641; Prafulla Kumar Swain v.
