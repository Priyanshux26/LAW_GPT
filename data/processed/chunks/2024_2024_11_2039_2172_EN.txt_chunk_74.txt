There is no specific direction as regard the payment obligations related to Gratuity nor any decision rendered on the two aforesaid IAs filed by the SRA in the Company Appeal. The NCLAT committed a serious error in failing to consider these IAs filed by the SRA and has given the impression that the SRA is liable to pay only the Provident Fund dues upfront. 139. According to the SRA, the dues relating to the Provident Fund would be paid upfront in compliance with Section 11 of the Employees’ Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. However, the Gratuity Dues could be paid in tranches since neither the dated 21.10.2022 of the NCLAT nor the dated 30.01.2023 of this Court had imposed any timelines for the payment of the Gratuity Dues. Furthermore, it was submitted that the provisions of 2146 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 were not so stringent. However, such a proposal cannot be allowed especially in light of the fact that the dated 21.10.2022 of the NCLAT is unambiguous in its declaration that both Provident Fund and Gratuity dues have to be paid by the SRA in to save the Resolution Plan from being hit by Section 30(2)(e) of the IBC, 2016. 140. Therefore, by not infusing the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore as per the Implementation Schedule of the Resolution Plan, the SRA has breached the terms of the Resolution Plan which required a minimum liquidation value of Rs. 113 Crore to be paid towards the Workmen and Employees’ Dues as well. Moreover, both the Provident Fund and Gratuity Dues amounting to Rs. 226 Crore should also have been paid by the SRA as per the dated 21.10.2022 of the NCLAT in fulfillment of its obligations, which it failed to do. c. Whether there were sufficient grounds before the NCLAT to hold that Respondent No.1/SRA had contravened the terms of the approved Resolution Plan and that the Corporate Debtor must be directed to be liquidated under Section 33(3) of the IBC, 2016? 141. The NCLAT in its impugned held that the non-deposit of Rs. 150 Crore in cash towards the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore cannot lead to the conclusion that the Resolution Plan had failed. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow: “79. The submission of the Appellant that on account of non-deposit INR 150 crores as directed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, should lead to liquidation of the Corporate Debtor, cannot be accepted. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in its dated 18.01.2024 has clearly held that its modifying the direction of the Tribunal is confined only to the permission granted to the SRA to adjust INR 150 crores PBG. Thus, modification of the by the Hon’ble Supreme Court also has to confine to the adjustment of the PBG. It was held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court that Appellant have asked for infusion of INR 350 crores and infusion does not include adjustment of PBG. The Hon’ble Supreme Court neither considered nor expressed any opinion on the question of liquidation of the Corporate Debtor, [2024] 11 S.C.R.
