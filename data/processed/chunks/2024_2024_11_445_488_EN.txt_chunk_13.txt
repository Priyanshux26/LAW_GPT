Ultimately, the appellant obtained the Essentiality Certificate on 16.06.2011. Similar affidavits were furnished for the further imports and the respondent granted Essentiality Certificate only on the condition that it would have the right to seek appropriate reduction in tariff on account of decrease in capital cost of the project. 20. On 22.05.2012, the appellants filed a Petition bearing Petition no. 30 of 2012 before the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission, Chandigarh under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act, 2003, contending that appellant no. 2 had considered and factored the benefits available to the project under the Mega Power Policy of 2009, on 09.10.2009 when they submitted the bid and had passed on such benefits to the respondent by way of the tariff it quoted. The appellant contended that no change in law occurred in view of the notification of 11.12.2009 and 14.12.2009 and whatever change was there, happened on 01.10.2009 itself with the press release of the Cabinet decision. The following prayers were made in the claim petition: “In light of the facts and circumstances as stated above, the Petitioners are respectfully praying before this Hon’ble Commission: “(a) to declare that the Union Cabinet’s decision dated 01.10.2009 modifying the Mega Policy 2006 reported vide Press Information Bureau on the same date does not amount to ‘Change in Law’ under Article 13 of the PPA; (b) following the declaratory relief sought by the Petitioners, to hold that consequential relief as set out under Article 13.2 of the PPA has not triggered and no consequential benefits under Article 13 have to be passed on to the Respondent by the Petitioner under the PPA on account of Union Cabinet’s decision to change the Mega Policy 2006 dated 01.10.2009; [2024] 11 S.C.R. 467 Nabha Power Limited & Anr. v. Punjab State Power Coroporation Limited & Anr. (c) in alternative, if reliefs sought under para (a) and (b) above are not granted, then to direct and allow that the Petitioners shall be entitled to claim ‘Change in Law’ against the Respondent’s claim on the basis of withdrawal of fiscal benefits which were available to the Project under the FTP on the date of bidding on standalone basis, without considering Mega Policy, 2009; (d) award cost in favour of the Petitioners; (e) pass such other and further s / directions as the Hon’ble Commission may deem appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case.” Though the prayer are not happily worded, the issue raised with regard to the Mega Power Policy issue, as understood by both parties, is whether the legal regime was altered on 01.10.2009 or on 11.12.2009 and 14.12.2009 respectively. 21. The appellant’s claim before the Commission was founded on twin basis. The main relief was on the aspect of the Mega Power Policy, the contention of the appellant being that the legal regime was altered on 01.10.2009, with the Cabinet Decision, as noticed in the Press Release of 01.10.2009. The alternative plea was based on the Foreign Trade Policy (in short ‘FTP’) and the appellants contention was that in the alternative, the appellant was entitled to claim change in law against the respondent on the basis of withdrawal of fiscal benefits which were available to the project under the Foreign Trade Policy on the date of bidding, on a standalone basis without considering the Mega Power Policy of 2009. of the State Commission 22.
