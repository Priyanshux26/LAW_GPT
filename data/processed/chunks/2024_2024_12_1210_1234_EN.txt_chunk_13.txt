Thus, we, answer Question 1 that the consent decree dated 19-8-1991 was not registrable and the courts below have rightly held that the decree did not require registration.” (ii) Ripudaman Singh v. Tikka Maheshwar Chand12 16. The s of this Court in Bhoop Singh [Bhoop Singh v. Ram Singh (1995) 5 SCC 709] and K. Raghunandan [K. Raghunandan v. Ali Hussain Sabir (2008) 13 SCC 102] were found to be inconsistent in an reported in Phool Patti v. Ram Singh [Phool Patti v. Ram Singh (2009) 13 SCC 22] and the matter was thus referred to a larger Bench. The larger Bench in the reported as Phool Patti v. Ram Singh [Phool Patti v. Ram Singh (2015) 3 SCC 465: (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 312] did not find inconsistencies between the two s. 17. Bhoop Singh [Bhoop Singh v. Ram Singh (1995) 5 SCC 709] was a case dealing with both the situations, decree between the parties where the decree-holder does not have any pre-existing right in the property and also the situation where decree-holder has a pre-existing right. It was the second situation where the 10 (2020) 10 SCC 264 11 [2021] 4 SCR 1019 : (2021) 16 SCC 279 12 [2021] 6 SCR 562 : (2021) 7 SCC 446 1230 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports decree-holder has a pre-existing right in the property, it was found that decree does not require registration. In K. Raghunandan case [K. Raghunandan v. Ali Hussain Sabir (2008) 13 SCC 102], the dispute was not amongst the family members but between neighbours regarding right over passage. Obviously, none of them had any pre-existing right over the immovable property in question. 18. In view of enunciation of law in Bhoop Singh case [Bhoop Singh v. Ram Singh (1995) 5 SCC 709], we find that the [Tikka Maheshwar Chand v. Ripudaman Singh, 2016 SCC OnLine HP 3808] and decree of the High Court holding that the decree requires compulsory registration is erroneous in law. The compromise was between the two brothers consequent to death of their father and no right was being created in praesenti for the first time, thus not requiring compulsory registration. Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the suit is decreed.” Thus, it could be discernible that in to fall under the exception of Section 17(2)(vi) of the Act, 1908, the following conditions must be satisfied: (i) There must be a compromise decree as per the terms of the compromise without any collusion; (ii) The compromise decree must pertain to the subject property in the suit; and (iii) There must be a pre-existing right over the subject property, and the compromise decree should not create a right afresh. 11. There cannot be any doubt that in the civil suit filed by him, the appellant categorically stated that he is the owner of the subject land and is in long and continuous possession by doing cultivation for several years. When the Respondent No.2 sought to disturb the possession of the appellant by selling the subject land to third parties, taking advantage of his name standing in the revenue records, the appellant prayed for declaration and permanent injunction.
