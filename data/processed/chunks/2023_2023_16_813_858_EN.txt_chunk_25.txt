The State is entrusted with the authority to assess the needs of its public services. Exigencies of administration, it is trite law, fall within the domain of administrative decision-making. The State as a public employer may well take into account social perspectives that require the creation of job opportunities across the societal structure. All these are essentially matters of policy. Judicial review must tread warily. That is why the decision in Jyoti K.K. [Jyoti K.K. v. Kerala Public Service Commission, (2010) 15 SCC 596 : (2013) 3 SCC (L&S) 664] must be understood in the context of a specifi c statutory rule under which the holding of a higher qualifi cation which presupposes the acquisition of a lower qualifi cation was considered to be suffi cient for the post. It was in the context of specifi c rule that the decision in Jyoti K.K. [Jyoti K.K. v. Kerala Public Service Commission, (2010) 15 SCC 596 : (2013) 3 SCC (L&S) 664] turned.” (Emphasis supplied) 38. In light of the law above, since we fi nd that there exists no provision in the extant Rules or the advertisement to treat any other qualifi cation ANKITA THAKUR & ORS. v. THE H.P. STAFF SELECTION 855 COMMISSION & ORS. [MANOJ MISRA, J.] as higher or equivalent to the one specifi ed therein, the claim of such candidates, who could not demonstrate that they held the prescribed essential qualifi cations, is liable to be rejected and has rightly been rejected by the High Court as well. Issue No. (vi) is decided accordingly. Issue No. (vii): 39. It is well settled that an employer cannot be forced to fi ll all the existing vacancies under the old Rules. The employer may, in a given situation, withdraw an advertisement and issue a fresh advertisement in conformity with the new or amended Rules [See: State of M.P. vs. Raghuveer Singh Yadav (supra)]. Even a candidate included in the merit list has no indefeasible right to appointment even if the vacancy exists (See: Shankarsan Dash vs. Union of India29). Issue No. (vii) is decided accordingly. Conclusion / Directions: 40. For all the reasons above, the direction(s) contained in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the impugned of the High Court setting aside the closure of the selection process for Post Code 556 and to re-cast the merit list as well as fi ll up remaining posts of Post Code 556, with the aid of relaxation/ clarifi cation dated 21.08.2017/ 18.09.2017 read with communication dated 19.03.2018, after segregating it from those advertised as Post Code 817, are set aside. Though the directions contained therein were stayed by this Court, yet, as a matter of abundant caution, we direct that appointment(s), if any, made by taking aid of those directions, would stand set aside by this . 41. As regards those candidates who were appointed under the fi rst advertisement qua Post Code 447 not pursuant to the impugned , but by the State itself, based on the relaxation accorded vide dated 21.08.2017, the contention of the appellants in the appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.4321 of 2022 is, that out of 1421 posts advertised, 809 candidates appointed did not hold qualifi cations as per the 2014 Rules; they got selected only because of the illegal relaxation .
