83. Therefore, while extending the scope of ‘reasonable and fair provision’ in the 1986 Act to the entire lifetime of Muslim women, it was noted in paragraph 28 of Danial Latifi that ‘nowhere has Parliament provided that reasonable and fair provision and maintenance is limited only for the iddat period.’ Thus, it was held that an interpretative approach de hors the social facts and questions touching upon basic human rights should invariably be decided on constitutional considerations. Therefore, the Parliament’s enactment cannot be construed to intend unjust consequences according to this Court. This is because under the provision of 1986 Act if during iddat period, no provision is made for the entire life of the divorced wife or if the same is inadequate particularly with the passage of time then Section 125 of the CrPC can be resorted to. From the above, it can also be noted that if Section 3 read with Section 4 excludes the liability of the husband of a Muslim woman then there is no reason as to why his liability under Section 125 of the CrPC must also be excluded. 36. The 1986 Act thus continues to operate within the same juridical compass as the in Shah Bano and the reasons for upholding the constitutionality of Danial Latifi cannot be lost sight of. The crux of the reasoning in Danial Latifi is that the 1986 Act is a social welfare legislation that seeks to provide an additional right and thereby, an additional remedy. Danial Latifi implicitly recognises the cardinal principle of non-retrogression that prohibits the State from taking measures or steps that deliberately lead to retrogression on the enjoyment of rights either under the Constitution or otherwise vide Navtej Singh Johar vs. Union of India (2018) 10 SCC 1, Pr. 202. I therefore reiterate that the 1986 Act does not take away rights that divorced Muslim women have either under personal law or under Section 125 of the CrPC. I do not find any inconsistency between the provisions of the 1986 Act and Section 125 of the CrPC. Thus, a Muslim divorced wife is entitled to maintenance under Section 125 CrPC irrespective of her personal law, as reiterated in Shabana Bano vs. Imran Khan, 2009 (14) SCALE 331. Such a construction would 1302 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports not defeat the legislative intent and diminish the scope of additional protection afforded to Muslim women under the 1986 Act. 37. I note that the fixation of the three-month time limit for disposal of applications under the 1986 Act affords speedy justice and subserves the salutary aim of women’s welfare and social security. Thus, the 1986 Act expands the protection of women and ought to be applied as such. I find that remarriage of a divorced Muslim woman does not nullify her claim to a just settlement under the 1986 Act, vide Abdul Hameed vs. Fousiya (2004) 3 KLT 1049 wherein it was held that a husband cannot recover the settlement amount awarded under the 1986 Act merely because his ex-wife gets remarried.
