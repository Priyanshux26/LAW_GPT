In other words, he cannot take advantage of the Scheduled Tribes any further or for any other constitutional purpose. Having regard to the passage of time, in the given circumstances, including interim s passed by this Court in SLP (C) No. 16372 of 1985 and other related matters, we make it clear that the admissions and appointments that have become final, shall remain unaffected by this .” (emphasis added) 32. The circulars dated 11th March, 2002 and 29th March, 2003 were issued by the Government of Karnataka whereby, protection was extended to the persons who had taken advantage of the Caste Certificates issued prior to issuance of the letter dated 12th March, 1987, by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance, Government of India vide office memorandum dated 17th August, 2005 also ratified this decision of the State, and extended the protection granted by the Government of Karnataka to the employees of the respondent No.1-bank. 33. On a close scrutiny of the Office Memorandum dated 8th July, 2013, which was heavily relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondents, it transpires that the concerned authority in para 3 of the Office Memorandum referred only to the Government circular dated 11th March, 2002 issued by the Government of Karnataka for excluding certain castes from the umbrella of protection. It states that “the Government Notification dated 11th March 2002 related to Parivara, Talwar, Maleru, Kuruba, Besta, and Koli communities, whose members had obtained Scheduled Tribe certificates. In the said there is no mention of Kotegara, Kotekshathriya, Koteyava, Koteyar, Ramakshathriya, Sherugara, and Sarvegara, etc castes.” 34. Apparently thus, the above Office Memorandum was issued in ignorance of the Government of Karnataka’s circular dated 29th March 2003, which further extended the protection granted by the earlier Government circular dated 11th March, 2002 to the communities including Kotegara, Kotekshathriya, Koteyava, Koteyar, Ramakshathriya, Sherugara, and Sarvegara as well. This Government circular seems to have completely escaped the notice of the Ministry [2024] 8 S.C.R. 883 K. Nirmala & Ors. v. Canara Bank & Anr. of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India while issuing the Office Memorandum dated 8th July, 2013. Clearly thus, the Office Memorandum suffers from the vice of non-consideration of a vital document being the circular dated 29th March, 2003 issued by the Government of Karnataka. Hence, we have no hesitation in holding that the Office Memorandum dated 8th July, 2013, cannot supersede the communication dated 17th August, 2005 issued by the Ministry of Finance and the same cannot be read to the prejudice of the appellants. 35. In wake of the discussion made above, we conclude that the appellants are entitled to protection of their services by virtue of the Government circular dated 29th March, 2003 issued by the Government of Karnataka as ratified by communication dated 17th August, 2005 issued by the Ministry of Finance. The circular dated 29th March, 2003 issued by the Government of Karnataka specifically extended protection to various castes, including those which were excluded in the earlier Government circular dated 11th March, 2002.
