[Para 32] [Per Augustine George Masih, J.] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.127(3)(b) – The right for seeking cancellation of an by the husband: Held: There shall arise a couple of peculiar circumstances while considering the right for seeking cancellation of an by the husband concerned, through an application under Section 127(3) (b) of CrPC 1973 – The first and settled circumstance is that, when a divorced Muslim woman initially moves a petition under Section 125 of CrPC 1973 and seeks an for maintenance as against her former husband and only after receiving said entitlements, she chooses to exercise her substantial rights as provided under Section 3 of the 1986 Act, and therein, the husband is also able [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1241 Mohd. Abdul Samad v. The State of Telangana & Anr. to fulfil his concerned obligations to the appropriate satisfaction of the court, ensuring her future maintenance – It is then and only then that the husband can invoke and press his claim under Section 127(3)(b) of CrPC 1973 to seek cancellation of an , if so, passed under Section 125 of CrPC 1973, directing him to provide maintenance to his former wife. [Para 34] [Per Augustine George Masih, J.] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.125 – Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 – s.3 – Where a husband has fulfilled his obligations under Section 3 of the 1986 Act – The divorced Muslim woman subsequently prefers to invoke Section 125 of CrPC, 1973 on the ground of inability to maintain herself: Held: In a case where a husband has fulfilled his obligations under Section 3 of the 1986 Act or as provided by customary or personal law so followed, and the divorced Muslim woman subsequently prefers to invoke Section 125 of CrPC 1973 on the ground of inability to maintain herself, in such a factual matrix, undeniably, the right to move under this provision is open in favour of a divorced Muslim woman – When a husband opposes resort to Section 125 CrPC 1973, he has to establish that, (a) initial obligations under the customary and/or personal statutory enactments as detailed earlier stands fulfilled by him, and (b) that the wife, in the light of this, is able to maintain herself – However, if the husband fails to sustain the said objection(s) raised during the proceedings initiated under Section 125 of CrPC 1973, and an is accordingly passed, it would not be inherently barred or liable to be cancelled through an application under Section 127(3)(b) of CrPC 1973 – Nevertheless, other appropriate remedies as provided under the CrPC 1973 or any other law to that effect, shall always be open to be exercised by such a husband to seek setting aside or appropriate modification of an so passed under Section 125 of CrPC 1973.
