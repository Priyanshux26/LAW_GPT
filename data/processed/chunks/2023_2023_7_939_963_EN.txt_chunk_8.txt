In his application for permission to file the SLP, he stated that W.P.No.21323 of 2015 raised a challenge to the Highways Act, which H 950 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A was missing in his own writ petition and he, therefore, wanted to raise that issue before this Court. He was granted leave to do so on 09.09.2021 and his SLP was numbered as Civil Appeal No. 5697 of 2021. His prayer therein is to declare the Highways Act unconstitutional and void. Thus, K.M. Vittal Babu figures as the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 5697 of 2021 and is also impleaded as a respondent in the other appeals, along B with T. Chinnappan. 14.In the light of G. Mohan Rao (supra), the challenges before this Court to Act No.1 of 2015 and Section 105-A are rendered redundant. SLP (C) No. 4106 of 2020, involving such a challenge, was disposed of on 09.09.2021. Therefore, Issue Nos. 2, 3 and 4 dealt with by the High C Court in the common dated 03.07.2019 no longer require consideration on merits. In consequence, though numbered thereafter, Civil Appeal Nos. 5694 and 5695 of 2021 are infructuous and need no adjudication. The only issue left for consideration is whether the Industrial Purposes Act and the Highways Act are void owing to inherent D arbitrariness and infringement of Article 14 of the Constitution. In this context, it may be noted that, in paragraph 74 in G. Mohan Rao (supra), this Court observed that the contention, based on comparative analysis of the State Acts and the new LA Act, to establish violation of the equality clause under Article 14 of the Constitution, is left open. Parties were given liberty to raise all other issues not dealt with in that , in E relation to the validity of the State laws, in the pending cases arising from the dated 03.07.2019, including by getting themselves impleaded. 15. Heard Mr. Suhrith Parthasarathy, learned counsel for the appellants in Civil Appeal Nos.5692-5693 of 2021; Mr. N. Subramaniyan, F learned counsel, appearing for K.M. Vittal Babu and T. Chinnappan; and Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel, appearing for the State of Tamil Nadu and its authorities. 16. Civil Appeal Nos. 5692-5693 of 2021: The Industrial Purposes Act is founded on the premise that the State of Tamil Nadu G found it expedient to make special provision for speedy acquisition of lands for industrial purposes in the State of Tamil Nadu and for matters connected therewith. The scheme therein envisages that the Government would cause a Public Notice to be given under Section 3(2) of the Industrial Purposes Act, in such manner as may be prescribed, calling upon the owner of the land and any other person, who in the opinion of the H C.S. GOPALAKRISHNAN ETC. v. THE STATE OF TAMIL 951 NADU & OTHERS [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] Government may be interested in such land, to show-cause, within such A time as may be specified in the Public Notice, why the land should not be acquired.
