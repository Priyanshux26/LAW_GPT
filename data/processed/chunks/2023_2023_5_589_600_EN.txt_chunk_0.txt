[2023] 5 S.C.R. 589 589 RAMISETTY VENKATANNA & ANR. A v. NASYAM JAMAL SAHEB & ORS. (Civil Appeal No. 2717 of 2023) APRIL 28, 2023 B [M. R. SHAH AND C. T. RAVIKUMAR, JJ.] Civil Procedure Code, 1908 – Or. VII r. XI (a) and (d) – Rejection of plaint – The respondents-plaintiffs had filed a suit in the year 2014 before the Trial Court seeking declaration of title, permanent injunction and cancellation of various documents – C Appellants-defendants submitted that the suit of plaintiffs was based on premise that there was an error in partition deed dated 11.03.1953 and subsequent transactions – The appellant- defendants, filed an application under O. VII r. XI to reject the plaint – Trial Court dismissed the said application – Appellant filed D revision application before the High Court, which was also dismissed – On appeal, held: By clever drafting and not asking any relief with respect to partition deed, the plaintiffs have tried to circumvent the provision of limitation act and have tried to maintain the suit which is nothing but abuse of process of court and the law – If partition deed was to be challenged which as such, the plaintiffs E are attempting to do virtually, the suit would be barred by limitation having being instituted after lapse of 61 years from the partition deed – Plaint ought to have been rejected being vexatious, illusory cause of action and barred by limitation – of High Court and Trial Court set aside. F Allowing the appeal, the Court HELD:1. It appears that the suit is essentially based upon the premise that there was an error in partition deed dated 11.03.1953 and in partition deed survey number 706/A9 was wrongly mentioned. Therefore, it was the case on behalf of the G plaintiffs that one ‘S’ (son of original land owner) and other descendants including the vendors of the appellants never had any right to effect transaction in respect of land in survey number 706/A9. Deliberately and purposely, the plaintiffs have not prayed any relief with respect to partition deed dated 11.03.1953 though it is the case on behalf of the plaintiffs that there was an error in H 589 590 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A partition deed dated 11.03.1953. It is to be noted that pursuant to the partition deed dated 11.03.1953, after the demise of the original land owner, his five children got partitioned the properties under a registered partition deed dated 11.03.1953. Since 2010, the appellants are in possession of the land purchased vide registered sale deed dated 24.08.2010. Without challenging B partition deed dated 11.03.1953 and even subsequent gift deed dated 24.01.1968, the plaintiffs have instituted the present suit with the prayers which is nothing but a clever drafting to get out of the limitation. If partition deed dated 11.03.1953 was to be challenged which as such, the plaintiffs are attempting to do C virtually, the suit would be hopelessly barred by limitation having being instituted after lapse of 61 years from the partition deed.
