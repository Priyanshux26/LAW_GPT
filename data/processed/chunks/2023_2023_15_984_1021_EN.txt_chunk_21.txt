Rent, royalty or tax has already been recovered by the State Government and, therefore, there is no demand under that head. No penal proceedings, much less any criminal proceedings, have been initiated against the appellants. It is absolutely incorrect to contend that the appellants are being asked to pay any penalty or are being subjected to any penal action. It is not the case of the appellants that they are being asked to pay the price more than what they have realised from the exports or that the price appointed by the respondent State is in any manner arbitrary or unreasonable.” (emphasis in the original) 326. In A.R. Antulay [A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak, (1988) 2 SCC 602 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 372], this Court observed that it is a settled principle MUMTAZ YARUD DOWLA WAKF v. M/S BADAM 1013 BALAKRISHNA HOTEL PVT. LTD. & ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] that an act of the court shall prejudice no man. This maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit is founded upon justice and good sense and aff ords a safe and certain guide for the administration of the law. No man can be denied his rights. In India, a delay occurs due to procedural wrangles. In A.R. Antulay [A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak, (1988) 2 SCC 602 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 372], this Court observed : (SCC p. 687, para 102) “102. This being the apex court, no litigant has any opportunity of approaching any higher forum to question its decisions. Lord Buckmaster in Montreal Street Railway Co. v. Normandin [1917 AC 170 (PC)] (sic) stated: ‘All rules of court are nothing but provisions intended to secure the proper administration of justice. It is, therefore, essential that they should be made to serve and be subordinate to that purpose.’ This Court in State of Gujarat v. Ramprakash P. Puri [(1969) 3 SCC 156 : 1970 SCC (Cri) 29] , reiterated the position by saying : (SCC p. 159, para 5) ‘5. … Procedure has been described to be a handmaid and not a mistress of law, intended to subserve and facilitate the cause of justice and not to govern or obstruct it. Like all rules of procedure, this rule demands a construction which would promote this cause.’ Once judicial satisfaction is reached that the direction was not open to be made and it is accepted as a mistake of the court, it is not only appropriate but also the duty of the court to rectify the mistake by exercising inherent powers. Judicial opinion heavily leans in favour of this view that a mistake of the court can be corrected by the court itself without any fetters. This is on principle, as indicated in Alexander Rodger case [Alexander Rodger v. Comptoir D’Escompte De Paris, (1969-71) LR 3 PC 465 : 17 ER 120] . I am of the view that in the present situation, the court’s inherent powers can be exercised to remedy the mistake. Mahajan, J. speaking for a four-Judge Bench in Keshardeo Chamria v. Radha Kissen Chamria [(1952) 2 SCC 329 : 1953 SCR 136 : AIR 1953 SC 23] , SCR p. 153 stated : (AIR p. 28, para 21) 101 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R.
