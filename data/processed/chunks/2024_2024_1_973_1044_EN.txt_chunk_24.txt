The power under Article 309 of the Constitution to frame rules is the legislative power. This power under the Constitution has to be exercised by the President or the Governor of a State, as the case may be. The courts cannot usurp the functions assigned to the executive under the Constitution and cannot even indirectly require the executive to exercise its law-making power in any manner. The courts cannot assume to themselves a supervisory role over the rule-making power of the executive under Article 309 of the Constitution. While deciding the said case, the Court placed reliance on a large number of s, particularly Narinder Chand Hem Raj v. UT, H.P. [(1971) 2 SCC 747 : AIR 1971 SC 2399], where it has been held that legislative power can be exercised only by the legislature or its delegate and none else. 26 [2012] 2 SCR 912 : (2012) 2 SCC 542 : 2012 INSC 10 [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1009 The State of Himachal Pradesh and Others v. Yogendera Mohan Sengupta and Another 8. In State of H.P. v. Parent of a Student of Medical College [(1985) 3 SCC 169 : AIR 1985 SC 910], this Court deprecated the practice adopted by the courts to issue directions to the legislature to enact a legislation to meet a particular situation observing : (SCC p. 174, para 4) “4. … The direction given by the Division Bench was really nothing short of an indirect attempt to compel the State Government to initiate legislation with a view to curbing the evil of ragging, for otherwise it is difficult to see why, after the clear and categorical statement by the Chief Secretary on behalf of the State Government that the Government will introduce legislation if found necessary and so advised, the Division Bench should have proceeded to again give the same direction. Thus the Division Bench was clearly not entitled to do. It is entirely a matter for the executive branch of the Government to decide whether or not to introduce any particular legislation.” 9. In Asif Hameed v. State of J&K [1989 Supp (2) SCC 364 : AIR 1989 SC 1899] this Court while dealing with a case like this at hand observed : (SCC p. 374, para 19) “19. … While doing so the court must remain within its self-imposed limits. The court sits in on the action of a coordinate branch of the Government. While exercising power of judicial review of administrative action, the court is not an appellate authority. The Constitution does not permit the court to direct or advise the executive in matters of policy or to sermonise qua any matter which under the Constitution lies within the sphere of legislature or executive.” 10. In Union of India v. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal [1992 Supp (1) SCC 323 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 248 : (1992) 19 ATC 219 : AIR 1992 SC 96], this Court similarly observed : (SCC p. 332, para 14) “14. … It is not the duty of the court either to enlarge the scope of the legislation.… The court cannot rewrite, recast or reframe the legislation for the very good reason that it has no power to legislate.
