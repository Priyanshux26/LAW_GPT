184 in Salem. Thereafter, Public Notice dated 02.07.2016, under Section 15(2) of the Highways Act, which is the equivalent of Section 3(2) of the Industrial E Purposes Act, was issued calling for objections as to why their lands should not be acquired for the said purpose. After consideration of the objections received, Notice dated 01.02.2017 was published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, under Section 15(1) of the Highways Act, which is the same as Section 3(1) of the Industrial Purposes Act. F Thereupon, these two persons filed W.P.No.3276 of 2017 before the Madras High Court challenging the acquisition proceedings and status quo was ed therein. This case is pending as on date. 25. The Validation Act of 2019 states that the provisions in the First Schedule, the Second Schedule and the Third Schedule to the new G L.A. Act shall apply to land acquisition proceedings under the Highways Act. Part III of the Validation Act of 2019 pertains to the Highways Act. Section 10(1) therein states that all the provisions of the Highways Act, except the provisions relating to determination of compensation, shall stand revived with effect on and from 26.09.2013. Section 10(2) states that all rules, notifications, notices, s, directions issued or any other H C.S. GOPALAKRISHNAN ETC. v. THE STATE OF TAMIL 955 NADU & OTHERS [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] proceedings initiated under the Highways Act, except those relating to A determination of compensation, which were in force immediately before 26.09.2013 shall, for all purposes, be deemed to have been revived on and from 26.09.2013. Section 10(3) states that the provisions relating to determination of compensation as specified in the First Schedule; rehabilitation and resettlement as specified in the Second Schedule; and B infrastructure amenities as specified in the Third Schedule to the new L.A. Act, shall apply to the acquisition proceedings under the Highways Act. Section 11 states that except as provided in the Validation Act of 2019, the provisions of the new L.A. Act shall cease to apply to any land which is required for the purposes specified in Section 15(1) of the Highways Act and any such land shall be acquired by the Government C only in accordance with the provisions of the Highways Act. 26.Though Civil Appeal Nos. 5692-5693 of 2021 are liable to be dismissed on the ground of maintainability, the arguments of Mr. Suhrith Parthasarathy, learned counsel appearing therein, were adopted in toto by Mr. N.Subramaniyan, learned counsel for K.M. Vittal Babu and T. D Chinnappan. This adoption of arguments is based on the premise that the provisions of the Industrial Purposes Act are in pari materia with the provisions of the Highways Act, with which they are concerned. In that view of the matter, we shall advert to the arguments advanced by both the learned counsel in the context of the Highways Act alone. E 27. The Highways Act is stated to be discriminatory, both with regard to determination of compensation as well as the acquisition procedure, when compared to the new LA Act.
