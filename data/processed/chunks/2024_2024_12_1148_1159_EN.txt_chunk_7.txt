30. It is crucial to recognize that these appellants have already proven their merit and eligibility, and their inclusion in the rank list is a testament to their capability and diligence. The mere fact that certain vacancies remained unfilled due to procedural and administrative inefficiencies should not result in these candidates being excluded from consideration. Moreso, as their employer-the State of Kerala had requested the KPSC to expand the rank list and recommend further names for appointment against existing vacancies. Penalizing them for factors beyond their control would not only violate the principles of fairness but also undermine the very objective of transparent and merit-based public recruitment. Ensuring that these qualified candidates are given their due opportunity is both an equitable and constitutionally sound approach to address the extraordinary circumstances of this case. 31. The impleadment application bearing I.A. No.209123 of 2024, filed by eighteen other candidates appearing in the rank lists, is hereby allowed. 32. It is submitted by the appellants that the relief prayed for is limited to the twenty seven candidates before us, nine in the appeals admitted and eighteen through the impleadment application. The [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1159 Ajith G. Das & Others Etc. v. The State of Kerala & Others relief granted in this case shall not be confined to these appellants alone but shall extend to all candidates who have rightfully and meritoriously appeared in the rank list, having qualified the selection process. This ensures that the benefit of the decision applies uniformly to all eligible candidates who were included in the rank list and are awaiting appointment. Extending the benefit under this decision to all candidates in the merit list is only fair and equitable since it is possible that other similarly placed candidates may not have approached this Court owing to financial or other constraints, which shall not be an impediment to their career prospects and a fair, merit-based selection process for public employment. The principle of fairness dictates that all such qualified candidates should be considered for selection through the impugned process, whether they are before us or not, although such selection shall be strictly in accordance with their merit and the requirements notified by the State Government. By directing the KPSC to expand the rank list and fill the additional vacancies, this Court seeks to uphold the rights of all eligible candidates while aligning with the broader principles of equity, transparency, and merit-based public employment. 33. The appeals are accordingly allowed. The impugned of the High Court is set aside, and the KPSC is directed to expand the rank list under the 2014 notification to include the additional vacancies identified by the State Government. The KPSC shall take all necessary steps to facilitate the selection process of the qualified candidates, as per their merit, in accordance with the requirement notified by the State Government, from the same selection process without any further delay. 34. Pending applications(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the Case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
