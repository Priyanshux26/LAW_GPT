[Paras 31 and 33] Evidence – Circumstantial evidence – Motive – When not proved: Held: Initially, PW-9 (brother of the deceased) suggested an incident that occurred on 29.05.1999 as motive, when his father and deceased brother were assaulted but, the deceased had managed to escape – But the appellants were not named as assailants in connection with that incident – It is not understood how that could be a motive – Appellants are also not named among the suspected abductors/kidnappers – The motive thereafter projected by the prosecution against the appellants was that they found their sister (‘P’) in a compromising position with deceased in the evening of 25.06.1999 in the fodder room near Katvawala passage – Though, none of the witnesses had KRISHAN KUMAR AND ANR. v. THE STATE OF 863 HARYANA spoken of even seeing sister of the appellants and the deceased either inside the fodder room near Katvawala passage at the relevant point of time or even at any time proximate to the occurrence near the aforesaid place – Further, no evidence was adduced on the side of the prosecution to establish that ‘P’ was actually the sister of the appellants or at least one of them – Thus, they are not sibship and then, the question is what is the proximity of the blood between them – No evidence was adduced by the prosecution in that regard and on that aspect also prosecution relies only on the extra judicial confession made by the appellants before PW-7 which does not inspire confi dence – Prosecution had withheld their best evidence – In respect of the questions whether ‘P’ is the sister of the appellants; whether she was in love with the deceased; if so, whether she promised the deceased to meet at the fodder room near Katvawala passage in the evening of 25.06.1999; whether they had actually met at the said place near about that time; whether the appellants reached there and snatched her chunni and strangulated the deceased using her chunni, the best witness ought to have been ‘P’ herself – But, she was not examined by the prosecution. [Paras 30 and 33] Evidence – Circumstantial evidence – Motive – Signifi cance: Held: In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive does have signifi cance, but that is no reason to say that in the absence of motive, conviction, based on circumstantial evidence, cannot be made. [Para 33] Penal Code, 1860 – s.364 r/w s.34 – Charge under, framed against the appellants: Held: The phrase ‘common intention’ used in s.34 implies a pre- arranged plan and acting in concert to the plan – To establish an off ence u/s.364 it must be proved that the person charged with the off ence had the intention at the time of kidnapping or abduction to murder or to dispose of as to be put in danger of being murdered – Case of the prosecution, going by the fi rst charge, was that the appellants in furtherance of their common intention kidnapped the deceased to commit his murder – Though a specifi c charge was framed u/s.364 r/w s.34, the prosecution had not chosen to adduce evidence and virtually abandoned such a case – Relying on the evidence of PWs 7 to 10, a totally diff erent case was developed and attempted to be proved by relying on evidence of last seen, recovery of weapon viz., chunni, motive and extra judicial confession 864 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R.
