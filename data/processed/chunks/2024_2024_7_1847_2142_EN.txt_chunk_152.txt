GEAC decided that if the biosafety dossier is found to be complete in all respects, then the same excluding confidential information, could be put in the public domain for comments. After the first sub-committee meeting, several submissions and recommendations were made which are detailed above. Thereafter, the second sub-committee meeting was held and the sub-committee sought time to analyse and review the revised dossier and results obtained in 129th GEAC meeting held on 20.06.2016. The sub-committee suggested that the AFES report, prepared upon evaluation of biosafety data, be placed on the MoEF&CC website for thirty days to invite comments from stakeholders and the dossier also be made available in GEAC Secretariat for any person interested in studying the same. A total of 759 comments were received between 05.09.2016 and 05.10.2016 and 29 persons personally inspected the dossier at the premises of the MoEF&CC and provided their comments. However, the dossier was not put up on the website of GEAC. This is in fact a violation of the of this Court dated 08.04.2008 in respect of which contempt petition has been filed. 42.2 On 07.10.2016, this Court recorded the submission of the Union of India that no release of GMOs shall take place till 17.10.2016 because the Government had sought views from the public and upon receipt of such views and objections, the matter was to be considered by a Committee of experts, which process could not be completed by 17.10.2016. However on 11.05.2017, GEAC, in its 133rd Meeting, made the recommendation for the commercial release of DMH-11. However, on 31.07.2017, this Court recorded the submission of the Union of India that the Government has not yet taken a final decision, whether or not to permit the plantation of 2100 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, and a final decision with reference to the approval would be taken by the Government in September, 2017. It was also pointed out that the plantation is likely to commence in October 2017. At a subsequent hearing on 22.11.2017, this Court recorded the Union of India’s submission that the Government of India had not yet taken a decision in the matter and that all the representations of the stakeholders would be considered before taking the final decision. 42.3 Thereafter, in its 136th Meeting on 20.09.2018, GEAC re-examined the matter in light of the representations received and on a detailed discussion, agreed that the applicant may be advised to undertake field demonstration on transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 in an area of five acres at two to three different locations with a view to generate additional data on honeybees and other pollinators and on soil microbial diversity. Thereafter, in the 137th GEAC meeting held on 20.03.2019, there was a deferment of field demonstration studies on transgenic mustard during the year 2018-19 and it was extended for the seasons 2019-20 and 2020-21. Thus, it is significant to note that GEAC itself had deferred field demonstration studies on transgenic mustard and this was in supersession of the earlier decision taken on 20.09.2018 in the 136th meeting of GEAC wherein the applicant was advised to undertake field demonstration in an area of five acres at two to three different locations.
