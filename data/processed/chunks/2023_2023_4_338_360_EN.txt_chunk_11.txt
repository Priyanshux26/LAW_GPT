Chapter VI-A which provides for incentives in the form of tax deductions essentially belong to the category of “profit-linked incentives”. Therefore, when Sections D 80-IA/80-IB refers to profits derived from eligible business, it is not the ownership of that business which attracts the incentives. What attracts the incentives under Sections 80-IA/80-IB is the generation of profits (operational profits). XXXXXXXX E 28. In the present batch of cases, the controversy which arises for determination is: whether DEPB credit/duty drawback receipt comes within the first degree sources? 29. According to the assessee(s), DEPB credit/duty drawback receipt reduces the value of purchases (cost F neutralisation), hence, it comes within first degree source as it increases the net profit proportionately. 30. On the other hand, according to the Department, DEPB credit/duty drawback receipt do not come within the first degree source as the said incentives flow from the incentive schemes G enacted by the Government of India or from Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1962. Hence, according to the Department, in the present cases, the first degree source is the incentive scheme/ provisions of the Customs Act. In this connection, the Department H 354 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A places heavy reliance on the of this Court in Sterling Foods [(1999) 4 SCC 98 : (1999) 237 ITR 579] . 31. Therefore, in the present cases, in which we are required to examine the eligible business of an industrial undertaking, we need to trace the source of the profits to manufacture. B (See CIT v. Kirloskar Oil Engines Ltd. [(1986) 157 ITR 762 (Bom)]) 32. Continuing our analysis of Sections 80-IA/80-IB it may be mentioned that sub-section (13) of Section 80-IB provides for applicability of the provisions of sub-section (5) and sub-sections C (7) to (12) of Section 80-IA, so far as may be, applicable to the eligible business under Section 80-IB. Therefore, at the outset, we stated that one needs to read Sections 80-I, 80-IA and 80-IB as having a common scheme. 33. On perusal of sub-section (5) of Section 80-IA, it is noticed that it provides for the manner of computation of profits D of an eligible business. Accordingly, such profits are to be computed as if such eligible business is the only source of income of the assessee. Therefore, the devices adopted to reduce or inflate the profits of eligible business has got to be rejected in view of the overriding provisions of sub-section (5) of Section 80- E IA, which are also required to be read into Section 80-IB. [See Section 80-IB(13)]. We may reiterate that Sections 80-I, 80-IA and 80-IB have a common scheme and if so read it is clear that the said sections provide for incentives in the form of deduction(s) which are linked to profits and not to investment. F 34. On an analysis of Sections 80-IA and 80-IB it becomes clear that any industrial undertaking, which becomes eligible on satisfying sub-section (2), would be entitled to deduction under sub-section (1) only to the extent of profits derived from such industrial undertaking after specified date(s).
