In Charan Lal Sahu vs. Union of India, (1990) 1 SCC 613 (“Charan Lal Sahu”) and Subhash Kumar vs. State of Bihar, (1991) 1 SCC 598 (“Subhash Kumar”), this Court expressly observed that Article 21 includes the right of enjoyment of pollution-free water and air. Virender Gaur vs. State of Haryana, (1995) 2 SCC 577 (“Virender Gaur”) expanded the scope of the right to the effect that a hygienic environment is an integral facet of the right to a healthy life. The right was so construed in terms of the State’s duty under Articles 48 and 51A(g) to forge policies to maintain ecological balance by taking concrete measures to ‘promote, protect and improve’ the environment. 30.1 Thereafter, in M.C. Mehta vs. Kamal Nath, (2000) 6 SCC 213 (“Kamal Nath”), it was expounded that the fundamental right to life under Article 21 would take within its breadth a protection against disturbance of basic environmental elements such as air, water and soil. This Court articulated the positive duties of the State to take all necessary measures for the protection and promotion of the environment under the EP Act, 1986 in Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action vs. Union of India, (1996) 3 SCC 212 (“Enviro-Legal Action”). It was also held that if the Central Government omits to fulfil any of its duties under the Sections 3 and 5 of the EP Act, [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2083 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. 1986, this Court could issue appropriate directions to it to take necessary measures. 30.2 Therefore, the right to a safe and healthy environment encompasses a corresponding duty on the State to faithfully implement the environmental statutes and take all necessary measures. 30.3 The substantive concern of the right to environmental protection now also encompasses the adverse effects of climate change. This Court, speaking through Hon’ble Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud in M.K. Ranjitsinh vs. Union of India, 2024 (4) Scale 779 : 2024 INSC 280 (“M.K. Ranjitsinh”) has explicitly recognised that adverse environmental consequences, such as sea level rise, have a disproportionate impact on socially, geographically and economically marginalised classes of citizens. 30.4 The aforesaid elucidation of the right to a safe and healthy environment and the concept of environmental rule of law as applied in the Indian jurisprudential context reveals that the concept is one of the ways of embedding a consciousness about adverse effects on the environment into the sub-structure of the legal framework to inform an environment-protecting legal reasoning. Therefore, environmental legislation such as the EP Act, 1986 and the 1989 Rules ought to be interpreted so as not to infringe the fundamental right to a safe and healthy environment under Article 21. Where there is a choice of statutory construction, this Court would be bound to proffer an interpretation that effectively protects the right to a safe and healthy environment. Precautionary Principle: 31. The essence of the precautionary principle lies in the notion that ‘decision makers should act in advance of scientific certainty to protect the environment.’ [Source: Andrew Jordan and Timothy O’ Riordan, ‘The Precautionary Principle in Contemporary Environmental Politics’ (1995) 4(3) Environmental Values 191, 194].
