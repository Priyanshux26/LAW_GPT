Accordingly, the petitioner would in any case, have no valid right or claim over the subject shares having terminated his employment before a period of 3 years. 29. It was submitted that as per Recital 3, and Clauses 3.1 and 4.1 respectively of the Commercial Expertise Agreement, for the petitioner to hold the shares, he ought to have worked for a period of 3 years. Since the petitioner resigned on 18.07.2013, he is not entitled to these shares. In any case, any claim regarding the 4,00,000 equity shares, howsoever misconceived, can arise only upon the date of resignation i.e., 18.07.2013 and the Arbitration Notice being issued on 23.01.2017 was clearly outside of limitation. Therefore, the present petition is stale, belated and misconceived. 30. The counsel, in the last, submitted that Section 43 of the Act, 1996 lays down that the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable to arbitrations. An arbitration commences upon issuing the notice of invocation of arbitration in accordance with the arbitral clause i.e., Clause 13.10 of the Shareholders Agreement. Accordingly, where the petitioner seeks enforcement of the letter dated 22.09.2011, the Notice for Invocation of Arbitration was served 6 years later i.e., on 23.01.2017 and is hopelessly outside of limitation. For the sake of argument and without admitting, even if limitation for the claim of the petitioner with respect to the 2,00,010 shares is calculated from the date when he ceased to be in employment, i.e., from 18.07.2013, the claim is still clearly time-barred. IV. ANALYSIS 31. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the short question that falls for our consideration is whether we should decline to make a reference under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 by examining whether the substantive claims of the petitioner are ex facie and hopelessly time barred? 32. A three-judge bench of this Court in Vidya Drolia & Ors v. Durga Trading Corporation reported in (2021) 2 SCC 1 while dealing with the scope of powers of the referral court under Sections 8 and 11 respectively, endorsed the prima facie test and opined that Courts at the referral stage can interfere only in rare cases where it is manifest [2024] 12 S.C.R. 123 Aslam Ismail Khan Deshmukh v. Asap Fluids Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. that the claims are ex facie time-barred and dead, or there is no subsisting dispute. Such a restricted and limited review was considered necessary to check and protect parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably “non-arbitrable” and to cut off the deadwood. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow: "148. Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act states that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to court proceedings. Sub-section (2) states that for the purposes of the Arbitration Act and Limitation Act, arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced on the date referred to in Section 21. Limitation law is procedural and normally disputes, being factual, would be for the arbitrator to decide guided by the facts found and the law applicable.
