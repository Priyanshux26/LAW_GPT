However, this grant of status was made conditional upon the appellant satisfying the requirements stipulated in rule 3 of the Distribution of Electricity Licence (Additional Requirements of Capital Adequacy, Creditworthiness and Code of Conduct) Rules, 200510, compliance whereof was mandatory per regulation 12 [which stipulates that an applicant for grant of distribution licence shall, in addition to regulations 4 to 11, comply with the 2005 Rules] read with regulation 49 of the 2013 Regulations [which stipulates that all the general conditions applicable to a distribution licensee are also equally applicable to a deemed licensee]. The appellant was, therefore, directed to infuse an additional capital of Rs. 26.90 crore as equity share capital, contributed by its promoters, into its power distribution business via account payee cheques by 31st March, 2016. The relevant part of the and of the TSERC is extracted hereunder: “16. […] On a close reading of the provisions of section 14, we are of the view that the ‘provisos’ to section 14 are not applicable to a deemed licensee. The status of a deemed licence to a person under Section 14(b) of the Electricity Act, 2003 emanates from the Notification given under Section 49(1) of the SEZ Act to a developer of SEZ provided the deemed Licensee satisfies the other provisions of the Act. […] 18. We are of the view that the provisions contained in sub-section (2), (3), (4), (5) & (6) of Section 15 of the Act are not applicable to a deemed licensee. Moreover, [A.P. Distribution Licence Regulations] contains the Rules relating to procedure for granting of a distribution licensee from Rules 4 to 11 […] 10 2005 Rules [2024] 5 S.C.R. 745 M/s Sundew Properties Limited v. Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission & Anr. The Rule 13 of the Regulation stipulates that Rules contained in 4 to 11 are not applicable to a deemed licensee and these Rules contain the procedure for granting of a distribution licence to a person. […] 19. The Rule 13 of the [A.P. Distribution Licence Regulations] stipulates that a deemed licensee shall make an application in the form specified in Schedule - 2 to the Commission to get identified as a deemed licensee and rules 4 to 11 in the Regulations are not applicable to a deemed licensee, Thus, the Rule 13 […] has excluded the application of Rules laid down from Rules 4 to 11 […] As observed earlier, the Rules 4 to 11 basically deal with the procedure to be followed by a person for obtaining a licence from the Commission. By implication, Rule 12 is applicable to a deemed licensee also […] 20. We are not able to appreciate the argument of the petitioner that Rule 12 is not applicable to a deemed licensee. In our view, Rule 49 stipulates that all the general conditions applicable to a distribution licensee are also equally applicable to a deemed licensee. Thus, in our view, the Rule 12 is applicable to the petitioner. 21. The next issue that arises is whether the petitioner has complied with the provisions of Rule 12?
