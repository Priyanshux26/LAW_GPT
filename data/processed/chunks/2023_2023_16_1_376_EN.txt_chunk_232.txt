88 1951 SCC 568 89 supra 90 (1962) 1 SCR 688 91 (supra) para 2072 92 (supra) IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 333 [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] B. C.O. 273 is illegal and mala fi de: The essence of the scheme of Article 370 of the Constitution was stated to be that any decision under Article 370(3) must refl ect the will of the people. The State Constituent Assembly had already been dissolved. There was no elected State Assembly. The issue had not been put to the people in any other form and, thus, the will the people was not refl ected in any manner as urged by Mr. Sibal. C. Improper exercise of power under Article 356 of the Constitution while issuing C.O. 272 and C.O. 273. i. Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel, sought to strenuously contend that the route adopted by the respondents was Constitutionally unsustainable, as the power under Article 356 could not be used to amend the Constitution. What the respondents had done was to amend the Constitution of India and in to avoid the most stringent norm specifi ed for any amendment to the Constitution, a substitute had been practiced while taking recourse to Article 356 of the Constitution. ii. Without prejudice to the aforesaid, it was urged that Article 356 of the Constitution could not be used to make irreversible changes. Article 356 stipulated the provisions in case of failure of the Constitutional machinery in the State. Thus, an alternative arrangement had to be envisaged till the Constitutional machinery was restored. The interregnum period could not be used to nullify the powers, which solely vested with the Assembly of the State93. The mechanism of Article 356 of the Constitution was confi ned to a method for restoration of elected Government i.e., restoration of the democracy94. iii. An additional plea, sought to be advanced by Mr. Rajeev Dhavan, was that in the larger Constitutional scheme, the Supreme Court should read in a condition in Article 356 such that the Governor’s recommendation for imposing President’s Rule should also be placed before the Legislative Assembly. 93 Krishna Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar, (2017) 3 SCC 1 94 S.R. Bommai v. Union of India, (1994) 3 SCC 1, (Para 108 By Sawant, J.) 334 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. iv. Mr. Naphade, learned Senior Counsel, sought to urge that it was not within the limit of the President’s power to issue a proclamation that there was a breakdown of State machinery, thus necessitating his intervention, while the Governor had dissolved the Assembly and assumed power of the State. Once the Governor assumes such power, the very basis of the breakdown of the State machinery did not subsist95. 3. The big question mark of even altering the status of the State to Union Territory. A. Article 3 of the Constitution does not warrant the power to convey a State into Union Territory. i. Article 3 itself is under the heading ‘formation of new States and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing States’.
