Appointment of receiver in respect of any of the properties of the industrial company; IV. Suit for recovery of money from the industrial company; V. Suit for enforcement of a security against the industrial company; VI. Suit for enforcement of a guarantee in respect of loans or advance granted to the industrial company. 348 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 66. It is pertinent to mention that prior to the coming into force of the Sick Industrial Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993 w.e.f. 01.02.1994, the proceedings in the nature of a suit as mentioned in (iv), (v) and (vi) in paragraph 65 above were exempt from the ambit of the suspension as envisaged under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. 67. Thus, as can be seen from the plain reading of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act, for an industrial company to avail the benefit of suspension of legal proceedings, two conditions have to be fulfilled – First, one of the four requirements as mentioned in paragraph 64 should be satisfied, that is, the industrial company must be at the prescribed stage of proceedings before the BIFR or the AAIFR. Secondly, the nature of proceedings sought to be suspended should be one which falls within the ambit of proceedings mentioned in paragraph 65 above. 68. We shall first examine whether the first of the two conditions as mentioned above is satisfied, as the protective shield of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act is only available so long as the proceedings before the BIFR or the AAIFR are pending. It was observed by a three-judge bench of this Court in Shree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. v. Church of South India Trust Association CSI CINOD Secretariat, Madras reported in (1992) 3 SCC 1 thus: “….We are, therefore, of the opinion that the passing of the interim dated February 21, 1991 by the Delhi High Court staying the operation of the of the Appellate Authority dated January 7, 1991 does not have the effect of reviving the appeal which had been dismissed by the Appellate Authority by its dated January 7, 1991 and it cannot be said that after February 21, 1991, the said appeal stood revived and was pending before the Appellate Authority. In that view of the matter, it cannot be said that any proceedings under the Act were pending before the Board or the Appellate Authority on the date of the passing of the dated August 14, 1991 by the learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court for winding up of the company or on November 6, 1991 when the Division Bench passed the dismissing O.S.A. No. 16 of 1991 filed by the appellant-company against the of the learned Single Judge dated August 14, 1991. Section 22(1) of the Act could not, therefore, be invoked [2024] 5 S.C.R. 349 Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v. M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited and there was no impediment in the High Court dealing with the winding up petition filed by the respondents…” (Emphasis supplied) 69.
