1326 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 5. The effect of the 2001 , in essence, was that the basic pay scale of Headmasters stood revised from 4625-125-7000 to 6500- 200-10500, with a further revision of their Selection Grade from 4800-150-7650 to 7500-250-12000. There was, however, no alteration in the pay scales of SDI/ABSA and DBSA and resultantly, their pay scales became lesser than those granted to the Headmasters. 6. In to gain a comprehensive understanding of this issue, it is essential to take into account the revision in pay scales across various posts over time. 7. The pay scale granted for the post of Sub-Deputy Inspector of Schools (SDI) since the year 1945, with consequent revisions, is depicted in a tabular format hereinbelow: Pay Scale with Effect From Pay Scale Granted to Sub- Deputy Inspector of Schools (Rupees) 1945 120-200 1955 120-300 1965 150-350 1972 325-575 01.07.1979 540-910 01.01.1986 1400-2300 01.01.1996 4500-7000 01.07.2001 Not Revised The position of the ABSA, being equivalent to that of SDI, likewise bore the same pay scale of 4500-7000, with effect from 01.01.1996. 8. The pay scale assigned for the post of DBSA since 1945, with subsequent revisions, is outlined in the table below: Pay Scale with Effect From Pay Scale Granted to Deputy Basic Shiksha Adhikari (Rupees) 1945 200-250 1955 250-250 1965 250-600 1972 450-950 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1327 State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr. v. Virendra Bahadur Katheria and Ors. 01.07.1979 770-1600 01.01.1986 2000-3500 01.01.1996 6500-10500 01.07.2001 Not Revised 9. Lastly, the pay scale apportioned for the post of Headmaster since 1945, with subsequent revisions, is detailed in the table below: Pay Scale with Effect From Pay Scale Granted to the Headmaster, Junior High Schools (Rupees) 1945 75-175 1955 100-200 1965 100-125 1972 240-390 01.07.1979 490-860 01.01.1986 1450-2300 01.01.1996 4625-7000 (4800-7650)* 01.07.2001 6500-10500 (7500-12000)* *Selection Grade Pay Scale 10. It may be seen from the above table that the post of Headmaster was placed in the pay scale of 4625-7000 w.e.f. 01.01.1996. Thereafter, the said pay scale was revised to 6500-10500 w.e.f. 01.07.2001, and in addition, the Selection Grade of Rs. 7500-250-12000 was also granted through the 2001 . Additionally, Headmasters also got a promotion grade pay scale of 8000-13500 vide a subsequent government dated 03.09.2001. No corresponding revision in the pay scales of SDI/ABSA and DBSA was, however, made w.e.f. 01.07.2001. 11. The perceived anomaly in pay scales being the hallmark of disputation, it may be useful to reflect the differentiation in pay scales, which have been granted to SDI/ABSA, DBSA and Headmasters since 1945, along with subsequent revisions, by way of the following comparative tabulation: 1328 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
