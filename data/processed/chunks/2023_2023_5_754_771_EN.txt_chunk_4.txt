D 6. Learned counsel representing the respondent-State submitted that the appellant did not cross-examine PW-5. He relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Satyavir Singh Rathi, Assistant Commissioner of Police & Ors. v. State through Central Bureau of Investigation5. He submitted that in this decision, this Court held that E the objection regarding the omission or defect in recording the statement under Section 313, CrPC must be raised at the earliest so that the defect can be cured. He submitted that the said contention was raised 16 years after the passing of the by the Trial Court. He would, therefore, submit that, at this stage, this objection cannot be sustained. He submitted that the very fact that the said objection was not raised at any time F earlier shows that there is no prejudice caused to the appellant due to the failure of the Court to put the only circumstance against the appellant to him while recording his statement under Section 313, CrPC. OUR VIEW 7. We have considered the submissions. There is no dispute that G the only allegation against the appellant was that while six accused entered 1 (2009) 6 SCC 595 2 (2014) 10 SCC 270 3 (2020) 10 SCC 108 4 (2019) 18 SCC 161 H 5 (2011) 6 SCC 1. 760 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A the house of PW-3, the appellant was standing outside with a katta in his hand. In paragraph 84 of the impugned , the High Court has observed that the evidence of PW-3, as regards the appellant, creates some doubt. However, it was held that the evidence of PW-5 and PW- 13 is clear and consistent as regards his involvement. We have, therefore, perused the evidence of the said three prosecution witnesses. PW-3 B Jawahar Lal deposed about the entry of 6 other accused into his house at about 03:30 pm on 01st October 1995. He did not depose that the appellant was standing outside with a katta in his hand. In further examination-in-chief, he stated that in his statement recorded by the police, he has wrongly mentioned that the accused-Rajinder Kumar was C guarding the spot. He stated that it was the appellant who was guarding the spot. The High Court has expressed doubt about the version of PW- 3 concerning the involvement of the present appellant. The reason given by the High Court is that PW-3 also stated that on the day of the incident, he did not see the appellant, but his name was told to him by PW-5 Ved Prakash. Therefore, the testimony of PW-3 cannot be relied upon to D implicate the appellant. 8. We have carefully perused the evidence of PW-13. Though the High Court has observed that PW-13 has ascribed a role to the appellant of standing outside with a katta in his hand, we find that PW- 13 has made no such statement in his evidence. E 9. Thus, what remains is the evidence of PW-5.
