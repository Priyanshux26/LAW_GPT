Land ownership is one such arena where we see the swords of powerplay being sharpened with continued fraud, deceit, and greed. While we shall deal with the facts of the present case in detail later, it is a classic example of continued suffering faced by the common man owing to mala fide intentions of the vendors who try to gain double-benefits, either by arm-twisting or through manipulation of the legal processes. Sometimes, the misery of the litigant is deepened when such travesty of justice is prolonged for decades. It is in cases like these, the law comes to the aid of the weak. While adjudicating such cases, it is not just the lives and the properties of the people that we are dealing with, but also their trust in the legal system. In cases like the one before us, it is not for us to just mechanically analyse the contentious transactions but to also ensure that injustice is remedied and nobody is benefitted by their own wrongs. Justice knows no bias and thus, through its aid, even the weak may prevail over the strong. 2302 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 2.
