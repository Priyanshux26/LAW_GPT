[(2008) 3 SCC 512] in which the change of recruitment criteria mid-way through the selection process has been held to be impermissible. We quote below paragraphs ‘27’ and ‘36’ of that from the said report:- “27. But what could not have been done was the second change, by introduction of the criterion of minimum marks for the interview. The minimum marks for interview had never been adopted by the Andhra Pradesh High Court earlier for selection of District & Sessions Judges, (Grade II). In regard to the present selection, the Administrative Committee merely adopted the previous procedure in vogue. The previous procedure as stated above was to apply minimum marks only for written examination and not for the oral examination. We have referred to the proper interpretation of the earlier Resolutions dated 24.7.2001 and 21.2.2002 and held that what was adopted on 30.11.2004 was only minimum marks for written examination and not for the interviews. Therefore, introduction of the requirement of minimum marks for interview, after the entire selection process (consisting of written examination and interview) was completed, would amount to changing the rules of the game after the game was played which is clearly impermissible. We are fortified in this view by several decisions of this Court. It is sufficient to refer to three of them - P. K. Ramachandra Iyer v. Union of India1, Umesh Chandra Shukla v. Union of India2, and Durgacharan Misra v. State of Orissa3. x x x 36. The Full Court however, introduced a new requirement as to minimum marks in the interview by an interpretative process which is not warranted and which is at variance with the interpretation adopted while implementing the 1 (1984) 2 SCC 141: 1984 SCC (L &S) 214 2 (1985) 3 SCC 721: 1985 SCC (L&S) 919 3 (1987) 4 SCC 646: 1988 SCC (L & S) 36: (1987) 5 ATC 148 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 231 Sushil Kumar Pandey & Ors. v. The High Court of Jharkhand & Anr. current selection process and the earlier selections. As the Full Court approved the Resolution dated 30.11.2004 of the Administrative Committee and also decided to retain the entire process of selection consisting of written examination and interviews it could not have introduced a new requirement of minimum marks in interviews, which had the effect of eliminating candidates, who would otherwise be eligible and suitable for selection. Therefore, we hold that the action of Full Court in revising the merit list by adopting a minimum percentage of marks for interviews was impermissible.” 16. The same view has later been taken by a Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Hemani Malhotra -vs- High Court of Delhi [(2008) 7 SCC 11]. In a later decision, Tej Prakash Pathak & Ors. -vs- Rajasthan High Court and Others [(2013) 4 SCC 540], a three Judge Bench of this Court expressed a view which is different from that taken in the case of K. Manjusree (supra) and referred the matter to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for being considered by a larger Bench.
