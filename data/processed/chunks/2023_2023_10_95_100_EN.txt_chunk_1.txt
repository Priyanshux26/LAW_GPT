Once that was so, this fact being in their knowledge from the very beginning, delay of 9 years in filing application under the 1923 Act, is certainly fatal for consideration of the claim by the appellants for award of compensation. In fact, the application before the Commissioner was filed on 02.08.2004, only after the proceedings in the tribunal E were concluded on 07.02.2003 and the appellants were not able to get any compensation in execution. Therefore, no sufficient cause is established for condonation of delay in filing the application. Thus, there is no infirmity in the impugned .
