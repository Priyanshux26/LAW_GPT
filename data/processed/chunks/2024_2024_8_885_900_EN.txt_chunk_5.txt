16. If the evaluation and selection of the petitioner would have been carried out on the basis of the unamended Rules, the petitioner having cumulatively secured 50.65% by combining both the written and the interview segment and would have been awarded ‘B’ Grade as per the mode of evaluation prescribed under sub-Clause (iv) of Clause 3 under Schedule ‘B’ of the MJS Rules 2005. With ‘B’ Grade, the petitioner cannot logically be placed in the category of failed candidates. 17. As was noticed earlier, the relevant advertisement for filling up the vacancy in the entry-level post of District Judge was initiated through the advertisement published on 15.05.2013 which reflected that the recruitment shall be governed by the MJS Rules 2005. The duly filled application was presented by the petitioner and he secured the minimum benchmark of 50% marks as a Scheduled Caste category candidate, in the written examination. If the unamended Rules were to be made the basis for evaluation of the performance, the petitioner with his 18.8 marks in the interview out of the maximum permissible 50 marks would have qualified, as his cumulative score (written 158.50 and viva 18.8) would have been 177.3 out of total 350 marks. His percentage in aggregate will then be 50.6% and this would have ensured his success as per the unamended MJS Rules. 18. In application of the MJS Rules 2005, we are quite certain that there was no cut-off marks or pass marks prescribed for the viva-voce examination in the present process when the recruitment advertisement was published. The subsequent amendment to the Rules with effect from 09.03.2016, cannot be applied to the present recruitment process where the petitioner participated. Moreover, the unamended Rules explicitly provided that the cut-off in the written test for SC/ST Candidates would be 50% and the final list would be calculated by combining the cumulative grade value in both written and viva voce. 19. During the course of arguments, Mr. Hansaria, Learned Senior Counsel for the High Court relied on the decisions of this Court in 894 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Kavita Khamboj(supra) and Abhimeet Sinha(supra) to emphasize the importance of interview for selection in the higher judiciary. In this regard, we must observe that it is well-settled that prescribing minimum marks for interview is not violative of the Shetty Commission report and the of this Court in All India Judges(2002) (supra). This Court in a recent in Abhimeet Sinha(supra) examined the following aspects:- “34.1. ((i) Whether the prescription of minimum marks for viva voce is in contravention of the law laid down by this Court in All India Judges (2002) [All India Judges Assn. (3) v. Union of India, (2002) 4 SCC 247 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 508] which accepted certain recommendations of the Shetty Commission? 34.2. (ii) Whether the prescription of minimum marks for viva voce is violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India?” 20. It was opined in the above that the prescription of minimum marks for the viva voce is not violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
