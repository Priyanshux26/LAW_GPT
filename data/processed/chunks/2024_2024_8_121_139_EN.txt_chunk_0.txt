[2024] 8 S.C.R. 121 : 2024 INSC 586 Sri Dattatraya v. Sharanappa (Criminal Appeal No. 3257 of 2024) 07 August 2024 [B.V. Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih,* JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the High Court had rightly affirmed the acquittal of the respondent in a complaint case moved for the offence punishable u/s. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 by its dated 03.03.2023. Headnotes† Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – ss.118, 138, 139 – Complainant-appellant case was that respondent had borrowed rupees two lakhs from him – Against the said loan the respondent issued a cheque, as a guarantee against repayment – Since the respondent failed to repay the loan despite repeated requests, the appellant presented the concerned cheque for encashment, as per the Bank Memo, the cheque was dishonoured on account of “insufficient funds” – A demand notice sent by the appellant – In reply to the demand notice, the respondent claimed that the accusations made by the appellant were false – Appellant filed a complaint case – The Trial Court adjudicated in favour of the respondent – The decision was affirmed by the High Court – Interference required or not: Held: Applying the settled legal position to the present factual matrix, it is apparent that there existed a contradiction in the complaint moved by the appellant as against his cross-examination relatable to the time of presentation of the cheque by the respondent as per the statements of the appellant – This is to the effect that while the appellant claimed the cheque to have been issued at the time of advancing of the loan as a security, however, as per his statement during the cross-examination it was revealed that the same was presented when an alleged demand for repayment of alleged loan amount was raised before the respondent, after a period of six * Author 122 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports months of advancement – Furthermore, there was no financial capacity or acknowledgement in his Income Tax Returns by the appellant to the effect of having advanced a loan to the respondent – Even further the appellant has not been able to showcase as to when the said loan was advanced in favour of the respondent nor has he been able to explain as to how a cheque issued by the respondent allegedly in favour of one M landed in the hands of the instant holder, that is, the appellant – The Trial Court had rightly observed that the appellant was not able to plead even a valid existence of a legally recoverable debt as the very issuance of cheque is dubious based on the fallacies and contradictions in the evidence adduced by the parties – Furthermore, the fact that the respondent had inscribed his signature on the agreement drawn on a white paper and not on a stamp paper as presented by the appellant, creates another set of doubt in the case – Since the accused has been able to cast a shadow of doubt on the case presented by the appellant, he has therefore successfully rebutted the presumption stipulated by Section 139 of the NI Act 1881 – The instant case pertains to challenge against concurrent findings of fact favouring the acquittal of the respondent, it is settled that this Court would ordinarily not interfere with such view considering the principle of liberty enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India, unless perversity is blatantly forthcoming and there are compelling reasons – Thus, the present challenge to the aforesaid impugned dated 03.03.2023 by the High Court is bereft of any merits and does not call for any interference.
