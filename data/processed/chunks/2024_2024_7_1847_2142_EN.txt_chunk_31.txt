Second, legislators are privy to information necessary for policy making which the Courts as an adjudicating authority are not. However, the policy underlying the legislation must not violate the freedoms and rights which are entrenched in Part III of the Constitution and other constitutional provisions. It is for this reason that previous s of this Court have held that the presumption of constitutionality is rebutted when a prima facie case of violation of a fundamental right is established. The onus then shifts on the State to prove that the violation of the fundamental right is justified.” (Emphasis supplied) 26 [2011] 11 SCR 1094 : (2011) 8 SCC 737 27 [2024] 2 SCR 420 : 2024 SCCOnline SC 661 28 [2003] Supp. 6 SCR 151 : (2004) 1 SCC 712 1896 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 26.10. A perusal of the s referred to supra shows two primary grounds upon which the validity of a legislation or, in our case Rules made under a legislation, may be put to challenge. One is legislative competence and the second is manifest arbitrariness. The former is not an aspect of challenge. In view of S.6 (rules to regulate environmental pollution), S.8 (persons handling hazardous substances to comply with procedural safeguards) and S.25 (empowers the Central Government for making rules to carry out the purposes of the EPA) of the EPA 1986, 1989 Rules were made to protect the environment, nature and health, in connection with the application of gene-technology and micro-organisms. 26.11. The latter, that is manifest arbitrariness, has been recognized as a ground upon which a legislative enactment can be judicially reviewed. [See: K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (5-Judge Bench)29 and Madras Bar Association v. Union of India & Anr. (3-Judge Bench)30] Equally, it is to be noticed that in Indian Express Newspaper v. Union of India (3-Judge Bench)31 it was stated that subordinate legislation can be challenged on any ground available against the plenary legislation. In other words, the distinction between subordinate and plenary legislation is erased when it comes to a challenge under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 26.12. In Khoday Distilleries Ltd. v. State of Karnataka (3-Judge Bench),32 this Court held : “13. It is next submitted before us that the amended Rules are arbitrary, unreasonable and cause undue hardship and, therefore, violate Article 14 of the Constitution. Although the protection of Article 19(1)(g) may not be available to the appellants, the Rules must, undoubtedly, satisfy the test of Article 14, which is a guarantee against arbitrary action. However, one must bear in mind that what is being challenged here under Article 14 is not executive 29 [2018] 8 SCR 1 : (2019) 1 SCC 1 30 [2021] 5 SCR 791 : (2022) 12 SCC 455 31 [1985] 2 SCR 287 : (1985) 1 SCC 641 32 [1995] Supp. 6 SCR 759 : (1996) 10 SCC 304 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1897 Gene Campaign & Anr. v.
