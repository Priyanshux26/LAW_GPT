We have in our “Interim Survey Report” dated 04.02.1999 discussed the following in details. The above details are not being repeated and final survey report may therefore be read in conjunction with our earlier report.” [Emphasis Supplied] 66. This is important because nowhere the 11.12.2001 report makes any reference to the 28.06.2001 letter of M/s Flat Products expressing their inability to reinstate the plant. There is a reference in Para 6.3 of the 11.12.2001 report to a meeting at the plant site on 19.06.2001 wherein the surveyors were given to believe that the Insured still desires to reinstate the mill. However, this was on condition that they will do so only after receiving further payment. Based on the inspection and negotiations that were carried out up to July, 1999, summary of assessed loss in para 5.23 was drawn up. This was fixed for replacement/repair at Rs.19.55 Crores (after deductibles like salvage etc). What is crucial is also that on this figure itself depreciation at 32% was worked out. The base figure was arrived at on reinstatement basis only and the same was adopted for the depreciation basis also. No doubt, depreciation was worked at 32%. This discussion is significant since the grievance of the Insured is that the NIACL ought not to have written the letter of 12.11.2002. We reject this contention. The NIACL was justified in writing the letter of 12.11.2002 because after reviving their demand to reinstate the plant, the Insured failed to furnish the documents required and even admittedly the plant as allegedly reinstated was of 6 Hi Cold Rolling Plant and not 20 Hi Cold Rolling Plant. In this scenario, one cannot fault the NIACL for writing the letter of 12.11.2002 particularly when the report of 11.12.2001 was before the new offer for reinstatement 316 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports by the Insured’s letter of 27.03.2002. Admittedly the report was based on discussions that took place till July, 1999 67. In fact, the surveyors, after receiving the letter of 10.11.2002 should have reassessed the value on depreciated value basis which would be to value the loss as per the opening clause of the policy i.e. arrive at the value of the property at the time of happening of its destruction. This was not done and in the response of 07.12.2002 the base value was kept at Rs.20.09 Crores and applied depreciation at 60% on the following justification: “As the machine was running at its optimum capacity, we are of the opinion that its residual life should not have be less than 10 years i.e. residual life as per our above calculation should be 40% thereby implying maximum applicable depreciation of 60%” 68. The Insured has stood to gain by keeping the base figure at Rs.20.09 Crores as value for the depreciated basis also. That was a value arrived at by the surveyors based on their expert assessment. 69. Dealing with the grievance that 60% depreciation had no basis, the NCDRC called for an additional affidavit from NIACL.
