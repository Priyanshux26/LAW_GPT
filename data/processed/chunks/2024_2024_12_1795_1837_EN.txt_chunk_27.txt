49. Finally, we consider it essential to say a few words about the approach adopted by the Division Bench in relation to ‘post-doctoral experience’, referred to in clause 7 of Tables 3A and 3B. It is plain and clear that respondent 1 did not question the same. In fact, the noun ‘anomaly’ had not even been referred to by respondent 1 in her writ petition. In the absence of any definition of ‘post-doctoral experience’ as well as a complete lack of pleadings in regard to such experience earning marks, but assuming that there was good reason for the Division Bench to notice a grey area, either the UGC or the appellants ought to have been asked to clarify. Without seeking any clarification, it was not open to the Division Bench to surmise and conjecture and to be guided to a particular direction based on a ‘perceived anomaly’ while giving its decision. We are inclined to the view that the Division Bench, in the absence of the requisite pleadings and the ramifications that are closely associated with its decision, ought to have adopted a hands-off approach in this regard.
