600 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 107. It is only on 16.09.2023 i.e., much after the cancellation of the tender that the Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Department, Government of West Bengal modified its earlier whereby both, the control along with the right to revenue for the said structures were handed over to KMC from the respondent. This leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that the concerned minister’s decision to cancel the tender on account of purported ‘change in policy’ was without any application of mind, capricious and influenced by malice. b. Concept of Public Interest in Administrative Decisions. 108. The reluctance on the part of the respondent to cancel the tender is also evident from Note #97, wherein the authority expressed its concern over the potential consequences of such cancellation. The respondent apprehended that in the event the tender for work was being cancelled, the routine maintenance of the underpasses would be disrupted. Due to this, the underpasses would have to be closed until some other agency could take over the maintenance. The relevant observations read as under: - “Note # 97 [...] Besides, the underpasses are being maintained by the bidder. Once the contract is cancel led, the routine maintenance would be an issue till the work is awarded thru tender. The E&M Sector may be asked to do the maintenance by engaging one of the existing agency from their set up. 0therwise, both the underpasses should be under the lock and key or police custody. 16/01/2023 04:38 PM SUBHANKAR BHATTACHARYA CE (REBBRDG) (KMDA)” 109. From the above it is evident that the cancellation of the tender was not in public interest. It may also not be out of place to mention that as per the internal file-notings the respondent had itself acknowledged that the revenue model of the aforesaid tender for work was far more beneficial and was fetching higher rates than the existing models of other agencies on the E.M. Bypass. The relevant observations read as under: - [2024] 7 S.C.R. 601 Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors. “Note # 88 [...] In this model KMDA is saving Rs. 90.00 Lacs per year mentioned in Note#49 and earned Rs.62,67,110/- per year with 5% increment for each year. [...] So it appears that the rate of this current Revenue model tender are receiving much higher rate than any hoarding installed on E.M. Bypass. [...] 29/12/2022 02:52 PM SANTANU PATRA SE (REBBRDG) (KMDA) Note # 89 [...] The cost of revenue generation would be enhanced at a rate 5% at the end of each year, whereas, the authority need not to bother about the routine annual maintenance cost of appurtenances and labours, security force etc. which would increase as well. By this way two simultaneous benefits go in favour of the Authority. [...] 30/12/2022 05:54 PM SUBHANKAR BHATTACHARYA CE (REBBRDG) (KMDA)” 110. Thus, the respondent’s reasoning in the Notice of Cancellation dated 07.02.2023 that it was incurring financial losses from the aforesaid tender does not hold well either.
