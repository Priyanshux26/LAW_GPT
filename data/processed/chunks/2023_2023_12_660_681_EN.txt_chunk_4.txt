14. With regard to the relevance of Entries (i), (xii) and (xiii) of Schedule II of the 1923 Act, it was urged that they do not concern an RPF constable who, by virtue of Section 2(34) of the 1989 Act read with Section 10 of the 1957 Act, is a railway servant and, therefore, a workman as per the provisions of sub-clause (i) of clause (n) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 1923 Act. 15. It was urged that by declaring a member of the RPF as a member of the armed forces of the Union, the legislative intent was not to exclude the applicability of the 1923 Act, inasmuch as Section 19 of the 1957 Act, which was simultaneously amended, though excludes the applicability of certain other Acts such as Payment of Wages Act, 1936, Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and Factories Act, 1948, does not exclude the applicability of the 1923 Act. This clearly indicates that the legislative intent is not to exclude the applicability of the provisions of the 1923 Act on a member of the RPF by virtue of their inclusion in the defi nition of a “railway servant”.

It was also submitted that by Workmen’s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2009, with eff ect from 18.01.2010, the term “Workman” was substituted by the term “Employee” and, therefore, clause (n) of sub- section (1) of Section 2 of the 1923 Act, defi ning a “workman”, was omitted and new clause (dd), defi ning an “employee”, was inserted in sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 1923 Act. Yet, despite having declared RPF as an armed force of the Union and a member of the RPF being included in the defi nition of a “railway servant”, with eff ect from 1.7.2004, the newly inserted clause (dd), defi ning an “employee”, takes no exception to it. Therefore, the legislative intent has never been to exclude a member of the RPF from the purview of the 1923 Act. 17. As regards existence of an alternative remedy under Section 124-A of the 1989 Act, it was argued that Section 128 of the 1989 Act specifi cally states that the right of any person to claim compensation under Section 124 or Section 124-A of the 1989 Act shall not aff ect the right of any such person to recover compensation payable under the 1923 Act, or any other law for the time being in force, though such person would not be entitled to claim compensation more than once in respect of the same accident. 18. In a nutshell, the submission on behalf of the respondents is that the application before the Commissioner under the provisions of the 1923 Act was maintainable and it was rightly entertained and allowed, therefore, the appeal was justifi ably dismissed. 19. In support of her submissions learned counsel for the respondents cited a number of decisions, broadly on two general principles, namely, (a) that harmonious construction of the provisions of a statute must be adopted so that no provision of a statute is rendered otiose; and (b) that the 1923 Act being a piece of social welfare legislation, its provisions must be liberally interpreted in a manner that they serve the interest of those for whose benefi t it was enacted.
