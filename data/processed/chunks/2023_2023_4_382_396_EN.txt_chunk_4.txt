1258-1260/2019. 4. Shri Arijit Prasad and Shri C.N. Sreekumar, learned Senior Advocates have appeared on behalf of the respective assessees and Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG assisted by Ms. Monica Benjamin, learned counsel has appeared on behalf of the Revenue. G 5. Shri Arijit Prasad, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the assessee in Civil Appeal No. 7934/2011 has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the levy of penalty under Section 271C of the Act, 1961 is not justifiable at all. It is submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case there shall not be any penalty H leviable under Section 271C of the Act, 1961. 388 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 5.1 It is further submitted by Shri Arijit Prasad, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the assessee that here is the case of late remittance of the TDS and not a case of non-deduction of TDS at all. It is submitted that therefore, at the most, the assessee shall be liable to pay the penal interest leviable under Section 201(1A) of the Act, 1961. It is submitted that however, there shall not be any levy of penalty B under Section 271C of the Act, 1961 on mere late remittance of the TDS though deducted. 5.2 It is further submitted by Shri Arijit Prasad, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the assessee that Section 271C would be applicable only in case of non-deduction of whole or any part of the C tax [Section 271C(1)(a)]. It is submitted that Section 271C(1)(a) shall be applicable in case of non-deduction of whole or any part of the tax as required by or under the provisions of Chapter XVIIB. It is submitted that in the present case Section 271C(1)(b) shall not be applicable. It is submitted that therefore taking into consideration the words employed in D Section 271C(1)(a), there shall be levy of penalty of a sum equal to the amount of tax in case of failure on the part of the concerned person who fails to deduct the whole or any part of the tax as required by or under the provisions of Chapter XVIIB. It is submitted that in case of belated remittance of the TDS, there shall not be any levy of interest under Section 271C of the Act, 1961. E 5.3 It is submitted that as per the cardinal principle of law, a penal provision is required to be construed strictly and literally and nothing is to be added in the Section and the penalty provisions are required to be read as they are. 5.4 It is submitted that so far as the belated remittance of the F TDS is concerned, the Statute provides for penal interest under Section 201(1A) of the Act, 1961. It is submitted that the penal interest levied under Section 201(1A) is compensatory in nature. It is submitted that therefore, when the Parliament thought it fit to levy the penal interest on late remittance of the TDS for the belated period, there shall not be any G levy of the penalty under Section 271C for belated remittance of the TDS.
