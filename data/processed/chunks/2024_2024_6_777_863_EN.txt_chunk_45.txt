(iii) In Krishnan Kakkanth vs. Govt. of Kerala, (1997) 9 SCC 495, (“Krishnan Kakkanth”), this Court held as under: “27. The reasonableness of restriction is to be determined in an objective manner and from the standpoint of the interests of general public and not from the standpoint of the interests of the persons upon whom the restrictions are imposed or upon abstract consideration. A restriction cannot be said to be unreasonable merely because in a given case, it operates harshly and even if the persons affected be petty traders (Mohd. Hanif v. State of Bihar [AIR 1958 SC 731] ). In determining the infringement of the right guaranteed under Article 19(1), the nature of right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restriction imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, enter into judicial verdict (Laxmi Khandsari v. State of U.P. [(1981) 2 SCC 600 : AIR 1981 SC 873] ; D.K. Trivedi and Sons v. State of Gujarat [1986 Supp SCC 20] and Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia v. Union of India [(1969) 2 SCC 166 : AIR 1970 SC 1453] ). [2024] 6 S.C.R. 847 Shaji Poulose v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India & Others 28. Under clause (1)(g) of Article 19, every citizen has a freedom and right to choose his own employment or take up any trade or calling subject only to the limits as may be imposed by the State in the interests of public welfare and the other grounds mentioned in clause (6) of Article 19. But it may be emphasised that the Constitution does not recognise franchise or rights to business which are dependent on grants by the State or business affected by public interest (Saghir Ahmad v. State of U.P. [(1955) 1 SCR 707 : AIR 1954 SC 728] ).” (emphasis by us) Therefore, it follows that this Court must consider the public interest involved not only from the perspective of the Chartered Accountants but rather from the perspective of the general public. In the present cases, it has been contended that public interest manifests as a benefit to the public exchequer in terms of appropriate quality of tax audit reports under Section 44AB. 25. At this juncture, it is useful to reiterate the thread of public interest visible in the 1949 Act since its inception. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 1949 Act makes it clear that the Act was brought in to ensure that accountants all over the country, in discharge of their public duties, are governed by a central body that is not transitional. Our words should not be mistakenly understood to suggest that the profession of Chartered Accountants is not a private enterprise and is concerned solely with rendering of public duties. We rather only highlight that it is a profession – licensed by the State – that also discharges public duties crucial in public interest. 26. In our opinion, a perusal of the Wanchoo Committee Report, Finance Bill, 1984 and the accompanying Memorandum makes it explicitly clear that the intent of insertion of Section 44AB of the IT Act, 1961, was to facilitate the process of tax administration to the benefit of the public exchequer.
