It also notes that they contribute to foreign exchange reserves. 25.2 As regards blending of ethanol with petrol, the contribution of Ethanol Blended with Petrol (EBP) programme of the Government of India appears significant. In this programme, fuel-grade ethanol is blended with petrol and is sold by Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) for use as a fuel in automobiles. In response to an Unstarred Question No.2764 answered on 20th December, 2023, the Minister of State for Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution had answered that: i) The Government of India has been implementing EBP programme and has fixed the target of 20% blending of ethanol with petrol by 2025; [2024] 10 S.C.R. 2167 State of U.P. & Ors. v. M/s Lalta Prasad Vaish and sons ii) The supply of ethanol to OMCs has increased by more than 13 times from 38 crore litres in ESY 2013-13 to 502 crore litres in ESY 2022-23; iii) To achieve the target of 20% blending by 2025, about 1016 crore litres of ethanol would be required and for this, about 1700 crore litres of ethanol producing capacity is required. 25.3 Further, a report of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India titled “Ethanol Growth Story” suggests that the EBP programme has at least three benefits: first, it raises income of farmers which is evident from the observation that OMCs have paid sugar mills nearly Rs.81,796 crore for ethanol supplies up to 2022. Second, it reduces import bills and improves India’s energy security. The report suggests that the cumulative foreign exchange impact is estimated to be over Rs.53,894 crore between 2014 and 2022. Third, it lowers CO 2 emissions and promotes a cleaner environment. The report estimates that Greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 318.2 lac tonnes due to the EBP programme between 2014 and 2022. 26. Thus, insofar as “Fermentation Industries” (other than potable alcohol) is concerned, both alcohol and other products of “Fermentation Industries” being a scheduled industry under the IDRA passed under Entry 52 – List I it would clearly be within the scope of Union legislation. It is clarified that as far as the concept of “intoxicating liquors” versus “industrial alcohol” is concerned, it is clear that Entry 33(a) – List III does not deal with “intoxicating liquors” which is a State subject under Entry 8 – List II. “Fermentation Industries” is a controlled industry and is a scheduled industry under the IDRA. It has been clarified by the 2016 Amendment that Item 26 dealing with “Fermentation Industries” does not include potable alcohol. Therefore, insofar as “intoxicating liquors” which is “potable liquors” is concerned, only the State Legislatures have the legal competence to enact laws concerning the said subject. Therefore, other types of liquor (i.e. excluding “intoxicating liquors”) comes within the nomenclature of “Fermentation Industries” which is a scheduled industry under IDRA. 27. Since qua State Legislatures, Article 246(2) is also subject to Article 246(1), the legislation which could have been made under List III (Concurrent List) can also be subject to legislation made under Entry 52 – List I.
