This is why Ramesh Gobindram [Ramesh Gobindram v. Sugra Humayun Mirza Wakf, (2010) 8 SCC 726 : (2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 553] was sought to be distinguished both in Anis Fatma Begum [W.B. Wakf Board v. Anis Fatma Begum, (2010) 14 SCC 588 : (2012) 1 SCC (Civ) 773] and Pritpal Singh [Punjab Wakf Board v. Pritpal Singh, 2013 SCC OnLine SC 1345] and such distinction was taken note of in Akkode Jumayath Palli Paripalana Committee [Akkode Jumayath Palli Paripalana Committee v. P.V. Ibrahim Haji, (2014) 16 SCC 65 : (2015) 3 SCC (Civ) 446]. Additionally, this Court in Kiran Devi [Kiran Devi v. Bihar State Sunni Wakf Board, (2021) 15 SCC 15 : 2021 SCC OnLine SC 280], refused to apply the ratio of Ramesh Gobindram [Ramesh Gobindram v. Sugra Humayun Mirza Wakf, (2010) 8 SCC 726 : (2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 553], on the ground that the suit was originally instituted before the civil court, but was later transferred to the Waqf Tribunal and that after allowing the of transfer to attain fi nality, it was not open to them to resurrect the issue through Ramesh Gobindram [Ramesh Gobindram v. Sugra Humayun Mirza Wakf, (2010) 8 SCC 726 : (2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 553]. 65. It is well settled that the court cannot do violence to the express language of the statute. Section 83(1) even as it stood 102 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. before the amendment, provided for the determination by the Tribunal, of any dispute, question or other matter (i) relating to a waqf; and (ii) relating to a waqf property. Therefore to say that the Tribunal will have jurisdiction only if the subject property is disputed to be a waqf property and not if it is admitted to be a waqf property, is indigestible in the teeth of Section 83(1).” (emphasis supplied) 30. On a proper analysis of the said decision, we have no hesitation in holding that the Wakf Tribunal has got suffi cient jurisdiction to try every suit pertaining to either a Wakf or a Wakf property, notwithstanding the nature of relief concerned, except as mandated under the statute. 31. We would like to consider one more issue by drawing a distinction between institution and adjudication. Institution of a suit before a forum where an adjudication process is the same as the other, insofar as the rights and liabilities are concerned, has got no relevancy when subsequently either an act or amendment has been brought forth conferring the jurisdiction to some other forum. In other words, the issue for consideration is the forum to adjudicate. This principle is subject to the rider that it may not have an application when there is already a decree where a party has not raised the issue of jurisdiction at any point before. ON FACTS 32. The High Court while passing the impugned , unfortunately did not have the benefi t of the decision rendered in Rashid Wali Beg (Supra). Even otherwise, as per the amendment by way of the Act 27 of 2013, the jurisdiction now lies with the Wakf Tribunal.
