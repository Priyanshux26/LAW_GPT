It will be medicament falling in Chapter 30 of the Tariff Act. B II. Are the ingredients used in the product mentioned in the authoritative textbooks on ayurveda?” *** *** *** C 48. Applying the twin tests for determination of classification of products (including common parlance test), this Court in Puma Ayurvedic Herbal (P) Ltd. [(2006) 3 SCC 266] held that Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10 and 11 were medicaments while Items 5, 6 and 8 were liable to be classified as cosmetics under Chapter Sub- Heading 33.04. We endorse the view that in to D determine whether a product is covered by “cosmetics” or “medicaments” or in other words whether a product falls under Chapter 30 or Chapter 33 the twin tests noticed in Puma Ayurvedic Herbal (P) Ltd. [(2006) 3 SCC 266] continue to be relevant. E 49. The primary object of the Excise Act is to raise revenue for which various products are differently classified in the new Tariff Act. Resort should, in the circumstances, be had to popular meaning and understanding attached to such products by those using the product and not to be had to the scientific and technical F meaning of the terms and expressions used. The approach of the consumer or user towards the product, thus, assumes significance. What is important to be seen is how the consumer looks at a product and what is his perception in respect of such product. The user’s understanding is a strong factor in determination of classification of the G products. *** *** *** 52. The approach of the West Regional Bench is fallacious in what we have indicated above as it overlooks and ignores common H COMMISSSIONER OF CUSTOMS, CENTRAL EXCISE AND SERVICE TAX, 327 HYDERABAD v. ASHWANI HOMEO PHARMACY [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] parlance test which is one of the well-recognised tests to determine A whether the product is classifiable as medicament or cosmetic and that has been consistently followed by this Court including with regard to this very product. It also overlooks the well- settled legal position that without a change in the nature or a change in the use of the product and in the absence of a B statutory definition, the product will not change its character. The product DML remains the same in its composition, character and uses. We have already held above that Sub- Heading 3003.31 does not define ayurvedic medicine and, therefore, there cannot be any justification enough for changing the classification of the product DML which has C not been held to be ayurvedic medicine by this Court. *** *** *** 56. There is no doubt that a specific entry must prevail over a general entry. This is reflected from Rule 3(a) of the general Rules D of interpretation that states that Heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to Headings providing a more general description. DML is a tooth powder which has not been held to be ayurvedic medicine in common parlance in Baidyanath I [(1996) 9 SCC 402].
