It should be emphasized however, that these prescriptive rights and disabilities received their greatest governmental support not from direct judicial enforcement but from the recognition of caste autonomy i.e., from the refusal of the courts to interfere with the right of caste groups to apply sanctions against those who defied these usage.”202 119. Galanter also highlighted how caste discrimination received direct support from British courts in certain cases: “Caste groups did enjoy active support of the courts in upholding their claims for precedence and exclusiveness. Courts granted injunctions to restrain members of particular castes from entering temples - even ones that were publicly supported and dedicated to the entire Hindu community. Damages were awarded for purificatory ceremonies necessitated by the pollution caused by the presence of lower castes; such pollution was actionable as a trespass on the person of the higher caste worshippers. It was 201 Marc Galanter, “Law and Caste in Modern India”, Asian Survey (1963), Vol. 3, No. 11, pp. 544–59, at p. 545. 202 Ibid, at p. 548 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 573 Sukanya Shantha v. Union of India & Ors. a criminal offence for a member of an excluded caste knowingly to pollute a temple by his presence.”203 British criminal law became intertwined with pre-colonial notions of who should be disciplined and punished. iii. Repeal of Criminal Tribes Act 120. When the Objectives Resolution was placed in the Constituent Assembly, HJ Khandekar stated, on 21 January 1947: “One thing is wanting in the Resolution, and, if the mover agrees, it can be modified. The Resolution promises safeguards and rights to all the minorities. But unfortunately there are 10 million people in India who, without any fault on their part, are described as criminal tribes from their very birth. Hundreds of thousands of men and women in India were declared as criminal tribes according to the current law. To deprive them of their rights they are declared so. No matter whether they are criminals or not, from their very birth they are made criminals. Some provision to abolish this law must be embodied in this Resolution.” Khandekar raised the concerns of the persons who were declared as criminal tribes. 121. In 1947, an amendment to the Act abolished the punishment imposed on criminal tribes for second and third convictions under specified offences.204 As some provinces had concurrent jurisdiction on this issue, they could amend or repeal the Act in its application to their territories.205 The Madras government enacted the Criminal Tribes (Madras Repeal) Act, 1947 to end the application of the Act in its territory. Similarly, the Bombay government also repealed the application of the Act to its territory in 1949.206 122.
