[Paras 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 27] Constitution of India – Art.21 – Dignity: Held: Dignity goes to the very core of the existence of an individual in society – Any action which undermines dignity either by an act of another person or that of the State is potentially going against the spirit of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the security of all persons by ensuring that justice, liberty and equality are avouched for each and every person – By extension, if the dignity of a person is compromised, their human rights, available to them by virtue of them being humans and guaranteed by various enactments, both national and international, are imperilled – Dignity is an invaluable aspect of Indian Constitutional jurisprudence, and there exists a duty upon the State to take all action to protect the same.
