C 7.5. It is necessary to contrast the entitlements of different categories of lecturers on being placed in the selection grade, under the Government dated 21st December, 1999, vis-à-vis, the subsequent Government dated 29th March, 2001. The same is presented in a tabular form as under: D Qualification of the Total number of Total number of advance Lecturer at the time of advance increments increments under the recruitment under the Government Government dated dated 21st 29th March, 2001 December, 1999 A Lecturer, who has a Six advance increments Four advance increments E Ph.D. degree to his/her credit at the time of recruitment A Lecturer who Four advance Four advance increments acquired a Ph.D. increments degree during service F 7.6. As noted from the table above, a Lecturerwho has a Ph.D. degree to his/her credit at the time of recruitment wasentitled to six advance increments on being placed in the selection grade, as stipulated under Clauses 6.16 and 6.18 of the Government dated 21st December, 1999. However, the number of advance increments that would G accrue to such a Lecturer on being placed in the selection grade was reduced to four, vide Government dated 29th March, 2001. The Government dated 29th March, 2001 restricted the eligibility of lecturers to the advance increments which would accrue on being placed in the selection grade by providing that a teacher who had got the benefit H 382 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A of advance increments by virtue of having a Ph.D. degree at the time of recruitment, would not be eligible for advance increments on being placed in the selection grade. The benefit of increments on being placed in the selection grade was restricted to those lecturers who obtained a Ph.D. degree subsequent to their recruitment. As noted above, the Government dated 29th March, 2001 modifies the Government dated B 21st December, 1999 by providing, inter-alia, that Lecturer would not be simultaneously eligible for the incentives under Clause 6.16 and 6.19 thereof. On a reading of the Government of Kerala’s dated 29th March, 2001, it is evident that teachers holding both M.Phil. degree and Ph.D. degree at the time of their entry in service are entitled to four C advance increments which is as per the Government dated 21st December, 1999 extracted above. However, the incentives specified in paragraphs 6.16 to 6.18 of the aforesaid Government are not to be given simultaneously. In other words, a teacher is not simultaneously eligible for the incentives as stated in paragraphs 6.18 and 6.19. Similarly, a teacher is not eligible for benefits specified in paragraphs 6.17 and D 6.19 simultaneously. This would mean that this is the only modification made to the dated 21st December, 1999. It is also to be noted that the object of providing four advance increments to a Lecturer holding Ph.D. degree and two advance increments to a Lecturer holding M.Phil. degree at the time of recruitment E as Lecturer is in recognition of the higher qualification that they possess, as ordinarily a Lecturer must possess a post-graduation degree to be recruited as a Lecturer.
