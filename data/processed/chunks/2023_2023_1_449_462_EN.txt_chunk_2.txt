However, the purpose of F the transfer remains the same, which is a non-agricultural activity. By merely assigning rights to an agriculturist, who will be using the land for a purpose other than agriculture, would defeat the purpose of this Act. [Para 17][461-F-H; 462-A] Mannan Lal v. Mst.

PYARE RAM & ORS. 453 The of the Court was delivered by A SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J. Leave granted. 2. Both these Appeals before this Court are by the plaintiff who had filed a suit for specific performance, which was dismissed and later B his First Appeal before the High Court was dismissed on the grounds of delay. We may state here that the Plaintiff/Appellant was not a party to the contract of which a specific performance was sought. The contract was executed between the defendant and a company called M/s Himalayan Ski Village Pvt. Ltd. which was for sale of an ‘agricultural C land’ in Himachal Pradesh. There were two plots of land for which two different “agreements of sale” were executed, and hence two civil suits were filed. 3. In both the above appeals, there is a common challenge against dated 17.12.2018 passed by the Single Judge of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh in CMP (M) No.75 of 2018 & CMP (M) No.76 of D 2018. The impugned dismisses the delay condonation applications filed under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, declining to condone a delay of 254 days, because the reasons assigned for the condonation were not sufficient reasons for condonation of the delay.
