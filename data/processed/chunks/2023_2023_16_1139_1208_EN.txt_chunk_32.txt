to USA and Germany, in respect of income on dividends, interest, royalties, defi nition of royalties and fees for technical services. In the light of these, India notifi ed changes in the applicable provisions to the India-France DTAA and Protocols through a notifi cation in July, 200041. The recital to the said notifi cation of 2000 reads as follows: “And whereas in the Convention between India and Germany which entered into force on the 26th October, 1996, and the Convention between India and the United States of America which entered into force on the 18th December, 1990, which States are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Government of India has limited the taxation at source on dividends, interest, royalties, fees for technical services and payments for the use of equipment to a rate lower or a scope more restricted than that provided in the Convention between India and France on the said items of income.” 58. The amending notifi cation again followed the same pattern, as in the case of the India-Netherlands DTAA, of defi ning the rate and nature of relief on interest, and dividends and the rates applicable, and diff erent defi nition for diff erent dates for “fees on royalties and technical services”, i.e. 01.04.1995 and 01.04.1997 for Articles 11, 12, and 13. This notifi cation again reinforced India’s practise and conduct of giving eff ect of the subsequent event of a more benefi cial arrangement with a third country, to the country which had entered into a DTAA previously, on the basis of a treaty provision, through an express action i.e., a notifi cation under Section 90. Another aspect is that the India-UK DTAA and India-Portugal DTAA had a condition, i.e., that by Article 4, technical services (for the purpose of levying tax on income from fees for technical service) applied a condition that the taxpayer could “make available technical knowledge, experience, skill, know-how, or processes, or consist of the development and transfer of a technical plan or technical design” 59. Steria’s argument in addition, was that the India-Portugal DTAA was signed on 11.09.1998 (after 29.09.1992 when India-France DTAA was 41 Notifi cation No. S.O. 650(E), dated 10-7-2000 ASSESSING OFFICER CIRCLE (INTERNATIONAL TAXATION) 2(2)(2) 1185 NEW DELHI v. M/S NESTLE SA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] signed). The Portuguese Republic is a member of OECD. Similarly, India - UK DTAA was signed on 25.01.1993 (after 29.09.1992) and the UK is a member of OECD. Hence, the scope of India-France DTAA is less restrictive than these two DTAAs (India-Portugal and India-UK). The provisions of the latter two DTAAs enabling such acts to get benefi ts, too should have applied. The revenue argues that for the more restrictive defi nitions in the DTAAs in India-Portugal and India-UK treaties, to be automatically imported into India-France DTAA there is need for a notifi cation, before its scope could be imported. It is pointed out that the Protocol, of 10.07.2000 did not extend the expanded defi nition, and instead confi ned the benefi ts to defi nition and treatment of income from dividends, interest, and royalties.
