Article 14 of the Constitution prohibits class discrimination by conferring privileges or imposing liabilities on individuals arbitrarily selected from a larger group in similar circumstances concerning the privileges sought or the liabilities imposed. The classification must never be arbitrary, artificial or evasive. 53. The foundations of arbitrariness in the context of the classification test were laid by Bose J. in State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar35 and subsequently in Kathi Raning Rawat v. State of Saurashtra.36 Bose J. has questioned the propriety of the 34 [1979] 2 SCR 476 : (1979) 1 SCC 380 35 [1952] 1 SCR 284 : (1952) 1 SCC 1 36 [1952] 1 SCR 435 : (1952) 1 SCC 215 1408 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports classification test by propounding that mere classification by itself is not enough, for the simple reason that anything can be classified and every discriminatory action must of necessity fall in some category of classification. Classification is nothing more than dividing of one group of things from another, and unless some difference or distinction is made in a given case, no question under Article 14 can arise. Mere classification is only a means of attaining the desired result. Therefore, the ends cannot be entirely ignored and consequently, the Court in a limited way is not precluded from examining the legitimacy of the legislative object. 54. In a number of decisions of this Court, a similar approach has been taken. In State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa,37 this Court cautioned that classification can pose a danger of creating artificial inequalities and thus to overdo classification is to undo equality. Therefore, classification has to be demonstrably based upon substantive differences and should promote relevant goals that have constitutional validity.38 The legitimacy of the object, in a limited way, is a necessary element to be considered for assessing validity of any classification. The classification must be just and fair, which necessitates that the court scrutinizes the underlying purpose of the law. Many a case will ex-facie or demonstrably meet the equity compliance, some will be declared constitutional after in-depth judicial examination. This Court in LIC v. Consumer Education Centre,39 had accordingly struck down an insurance policy which was limited to employees of the Government or reputed commercial firms, as violating Article 14 on the ground that it did not meet the test of equality, fairness and justice. Significantly, the Court had observed that the doctrine of classification is simply a subsidiary rule that the judiciary has evolved to give practical content to the doctrine of equality. In Indian Council for Legal Aid and Advice v. Bar Council of India,40 the stipulation that advocates must be under the age of 45 for enrolment was invalidated as being discriminatory, despite its intention to address specific demographics.
