days 1788 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports from the date of consideration of the Ordinance by the Court, whichever period expires later. (7) The Visitor may, at any time after an Ordinance has been considered by the Court, signify to the Executive Council his dis-allowance of such Ordinance, and from the date of receipt by the Executive Council of intimation of such disallowance, such Ordinance shall cease to have effect.” C.3. Features of the 1965 Amendment Act 57. The Act was further amended by the Act No. 19 of 1965 (1965 Amendment Act). Most significantly, it revised the powers of the Court. Section 23 was accordingly amended as follows: “23. (1) The Court shall consist of the Chancellor, the Pro- Chancellor and such other persons as may be specified in the Statutes: (2) The functions of the Court shall be- (a) to advise the Visitor in respect of any matter which may be referred to the Court for advise; (b) to advise any other authority of the University in respect of any matter; (c) to perform other such duties and exercise such other powers as may be assigned to it by the Visitor or under this Act.” 58. Further, Section 28 was amended in terms of a shift in Statute making power: “286. (1) The first Statutes are those set out in the Schedule. (2) The Executive Council may make new or additional Statutes or may amend or repeal the Statutes; but every new Statute or addition to the Statutes or any amendment or repeal of a Statute shall require the previous approval of the Visitor who may sanction or disallow it or return it to the Executive Council for further consideration.” [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1789 Aligarh Muslim University v. Naresh Agarwal & Ors. 59. Having now outlined the legal history of the AMU Act, 1920 as amended till 1965 and the sequence of relevant events, we now turn to the verdict rendered by the five-judge Constitution Bench in Azeez Basha (supra), which constitutes the sine qua non of the present reference. D. Challenge to the constitutionality of the 1951 and 1965 Amendment Acts 60. Shortly after the amendment in 1965, the constitutionality of the 1951 and 1965 Amendment Acts was challenged before this Court, which led to the decision in Azeez Basha (supra). The constitutionality of these statutory enactments was primarily examined on the anvil of Article 30 of the Constitution of India, to determine whether AMU could fulfil the litmus test of being a minority educational institution. D.1. Contentions proffered by the parties therein D.1.1. Contentions of the Petitioners 61. Briefly, the Petitioners in Azeez Basha (supra) contended that: a. AMU was established by the Muslim minority and therefore, the Muslims had the right to administer it. Insofar as the 1951 and 1965 Amendment Acts take away or abridge any part of that right, they are ultra vires Article 30(1). b. Article 26 would not apply to educational institutions for there is a specific provision in Article 30(1) with respect to educational institutions and therefore, institutions for charitable purposes in Article 26 (a) refer to institutions other than educational ones.
