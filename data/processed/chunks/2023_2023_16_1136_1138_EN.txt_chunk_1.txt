3. In view of the grant of permission to withdraw the special leave petition, we do not think it necessary to delve into the matter any further. However, we have to reiterate the concern of this Court on the lethargy in following the earlier s in the matter of dealing with bail applications 113 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. arising out of the same FIR to avoid confl icting decisions. We shall not be understood to have said that at all circumstances co-accused in such cases are invariably entitled to parity and that such entitlement is certainly dependent on various relevant facts and factors. 4. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in SLP (Crl.) No.7203 of 2023 as per dated 31.07.2023, took note of such a situation and observed as follows:- “7. We have come across various matters from the High Court of Allahabad, wherein matters arising out of the same FIR are placed before diff erent Judges. This leads to anomalous situation. Inasmuch as some of the learned Judges grant bail and some other Judges refuse to grant bail, even when the role attributed to the applicants is almost similar. 8. We fi nd that it will be appropriate that all the matters pertaining to one FIR are listed before the same Judge so that there is consistency in the s passed.” 5. After making such observations, this Court issued a direction to the Registrar (Judicial) of this Court to communicate the said to the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court of Allahabad. 6. Now, taking note of the fact that such situations are occurring in other High Courts as well, we are of the view that the Registrar (Judicial) of the Registry of this Court be directed to communicate this along with a copy of the dated 31.07.2023 in SLP (Crl.) No.7203 of 2023 to the Registrar (Judicial) of all the High Courts. On their receipt, they shall place the s before the Hon’ble Chief Justice of the respective High Courts.
