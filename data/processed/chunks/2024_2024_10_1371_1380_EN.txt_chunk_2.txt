4. The respondents as such invoked the writ jurisdiction of the High Court challenging the action of the appellant-Bank cancelling the auction dated 10.04.2018 unilaterally and for seeking a direction to issue the sale certificate after receiving the balance sale consideration of Rs. 1,06,50,000/-. 5. The aforesaid Writ Petition No. 3820 of 2020 filed by the respondents was allowed by the impugned and dated 19.09.2022 passed by the High Court holding that the appellant-Bank was not justified in withholding the sale certificate. The respondents were always ready and willing to pay the sale consideration. The appellant-Bank could not have denied the issuance of the sale certificate and the execution of the sale deed. The issuance of the sale certificate was not refused by the appellant-Bank for want of non-deposit of the balance sale consideration within 90 days as stipulated under Rule 9(4) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002,1 therefore, such a plea taken by the appellant-Bank for the first time in the writ petition is not tenable. 6. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant-Bank is that in view of the statutory provisions contained under the Rules, especially Rule 9(4) of the Rules, since the respondents had not deposited the balance sale consideration within the mandatory period of 90 days, the High Court has erred in directing the appellant-Bank to issue the sale certificate and to execute the sale deed. The balance sale consideration was never deposited by the respondents within the time permitted and the letter(s) of the respondents clearly establishes that 1 Hereinafter referred to as ‘the Rules’ [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1375 IDBI Bank Ltd. v. Ramswaroop Daliya and Ors. they kept on seeking extension of time without depositing the amount. Moreover, on the complaint of the appellant-Bank to the Central Bureau of Investigation2 made on 08.03.2018, the Enforcement Directorate3 had taken suo moto cognizance and issued an advisory to the appellant-Bank not to release the title deeds. 7. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the only issue which arises for consideration is as to whether there was any default on part of the respondents in depositing the balance amount within the time prescribed pursuant to the auction sale dated 10.04.2018 so as to attract Rule 9(4) of the Rules and allow the appellant-Bank to cancel the auction which had already been confirmed. 8. There is no dispute to the fact that the appellant-Bank had issued e-auction notice on 17.03.2018 and had conducted the auction on 10.04.2018. The respondents had participated in the said auction and were recognized as the highest bidder who deposited 25% of the auction money amounting to Rs. 36,00,000/- then and there. On the very same day, a sale confirmation letter was issued by the authorized officer of the appellant-Bank requiring the respondents to pay the balance amount of Rs. 1,06,50,000/- within 15 days so that the sale certificate may be issued. 9. It may be noted that the respondents at no point of time have denied payment of the balance auction money as demanded to be paid within the 15 days period.
