It was submitted that in terms of Serial No. 11 under Clause 7.7.1 read with Clause 6.1.3(g), the SRA had to infuse cash amounting to Rs 350 Crore and it was for this reason alone that Para 8(a) of the Lender’s Affidavit refers specifically to the infusion of Rs. 350 crore in cash by 31.08.2023. It was reiterated that the first tranche payment had to necessarily be made in cash since such a requirement flows from the Resolution Plan. It was not open to the SRA to contend that the Resolution Plan had a different mode of payment namely, the payment of Rs. 200 Crore in cash and Rs. 150 Crore by way of adjusting the PBG. The learned ASG contended that none of the clauses in the Resolution Plan stipulates such condition. To the contrary, under Clause 6.4.4, the PBG could be released or adjusted only upon the satisfaction of the twin requirements abovementioned. Therefore, the assumption by the Respondent that the infusion of Rs. 350 Crore emanates only out of the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023, is totally incorrect. The Lender’s Affidavit has not and cannot impose any condition over and above those which are provided under the Resolution Plan. The Lender’s Affidavit was filed to only set out a deadline for infusing Rs. 350 Crore by 31.08.2023, which was subsequently extended by the dated 28.08.2023 of the NCLAT to 30.09.2023. The Lender’s Affidavit only insisted on compliance with payment obligations within specified timelines and neither did it alter the Resolution Plan nor lay out new conditions. 36. The NCLAT in its dated 28.08.2023 fell in error in allowing the adjustment of PBG of Rs. 150 Crore as a part of the first tranche payment. This is evident from the of this Court dated 18.01.2024, specifically under Para 21, wherein it was held that an infusion of Rs. 350 Crore would only mean an infusion by cash and the same could not be substituted for the adjustment of PBG. This Court, further, under Para 25 directed that a failure to make this payment on or before 31.01.2024 would necessitate the consequences under the Resolution Plan to follow. This Court further issued a direction that the NCLAT shall decide whether the SRA had been compliant with all the conditions contained in the Resolution Plan as well as the conditions in Clause 8 of the Affidavit dated 16.08.2023. This Court made it clear that the non-infusion of Rs. 150 Crore in cash would lead to consequences both in terms of the Affidavit and also the Resolution Plan since the condition insofar as infusion was concerned, remained the same both in the Affidavit and in the Resolution Plan. Therefore, [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2091 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. the observation of the NCLAT in the impugned holding that the consequences of non-deposit of Rs. 350 Crore was that “the SRA was not entitled to take any benefit of the offer” is contrary to the Resolution Plan and the of this Court dated 18.01.2024.
