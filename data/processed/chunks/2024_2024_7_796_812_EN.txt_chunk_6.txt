The Ministry had written more than half a dozen letters right from 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020 requesting the Government of Bihar to issue necessary instructions to the Authorities empowered to not to issue Scheduled Castes Certificates to members of “Tanti-Tantwa” in the name of ‘Pan, Sawasi, Panr’. In paragraph-11, it is stated that the Government of Bihar informed the Central Ministry that as the Resolution dated 01.07.2015 was challenged before the Patna High Court and the High Court had upheld its legality vide dated 03.04.2017, as such, issuance of Scheduled Castes Certificates to the members of “Tanti Tantwa” and extension of benefits of Scheduled Castes to them was legally permissible. Paragraph nos.13, 14 and 15 support the submissions of the appellants in assailing the correctness of the impugned of the High Court dated 3rd April, 2017. Thus, the Union of India has fully supported the appellants. 806 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Submissions on behalf of the appellants. 25. Ms. Indira Jai Singh referring to the Constitutional provisions contained in Articles 366(24) and 341 submitted that the impugned Notification/ Resolution dated 01.07.2015 cannot stand and needs to be quashed, as the State Government had no competence power or Authority to direct the inclusion of “Tanti-Tantwa” in the lists notified under Article 341. According to her, any amendment or change in the specified lists of Scheduled Castes notified under Article 341 can only by a law enacted by the Parliament. The State has no role to play in tinkering with the lists notified under Article 341. 26. It was also submitted on behalf of the appellants that the State was fully aware that it had no authority or competence to amend the list as it had itself written to the Central Government for inclusion of “Tanti-Tantwa” in Entry-20 of the list of Scheduled Castes for the State of Bihar along with ‘Pan, Sawasi, Panr’. The said request of the State Government made in the year 2011, was not accepted in view of the comments made by the RGI in January, 2013 and the same were duly communicated to the State vide letter dated 31.01.2013. By the said letter, it was also requested that the State may further review and provide further justification in support of their request for including “Tanti-Tantwa” in the lists of Scheduled Castes. The State chose not to give any reply to the same and instead in a totally mala fide manner in to illegally extend benefit to the “Tanti-Tantwa” castes, it issued the Notification dated 01.07.2015 whereby “Tanti-Tantwa” castes were to be treated as Scheduled Castes and extended all benefits. The State has to be put to strict proof to explain, as to why, they had directed for merger of “Tanti-Tantwa” in the lists of Scheduled Castes with ‘Pan, Sawasi, Panr’. 27. It is also the submission of Ms. Jai Singh that the Notification dated 01.07.2015 cannot be severed so as to retain its first part of deleting/removing “Tanti-Tantwa” from the list of Extremely Backward Classes notified under the 1992 Act and to quash the second part only, which directed for merger of “Tanti-Tantwa” with ‘Pan, Sawasi Panr’ at Entry-20 of the Scheduled Castes lists for the State of Bihar.
