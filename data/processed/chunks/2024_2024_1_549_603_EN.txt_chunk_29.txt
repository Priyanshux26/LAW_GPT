(iv) The Enquiry, which was initiated by the ACB on 05.06.2018 i.e. much prior to the incorporation of Section 17A into the PC Act, was later entrusted to the AP CID. All the decisions that formed part of the offences were taken much prior to the amendment of the PC Act i.e. between 2015 and 2017. Therefore, no approval as contemplated under Section 17A would be required. (v) The offences allegedly committed by the appellant were not in discharge of his official functions or duties. Even as per the appellants case, he was neither the Minister In-Charge of the concerned Project, nor had he had anything to do with the concerned corporation (APSSDC). (vi) In the instant case, the alleged offences have been registered not only under the PC Act but also under various offences of Indian Penal Code (IPC) like Sections 409, 166, 167, 418, 420, 465, 468, 471, 201 and 109 read with Section 120(B) of IPC. Committing criminal breach of trust/misappropriation of funds could never be construed to fall under the discharge of official duties. In any case the question whether an act is within one’s official capacity or not can only be decided in the course of trial. (vii) As held in State of Rajasthan vs. Tejmal Choudhary,7 Section 17A of PC Act is ‘a Substantive Provision’ and is therefore applicable only prospectively. Section 17A envisages a substantive right against non-prosecution of innocent acts in course of official duty; and not an obstacle/ hurdle in the investigation process of the prosecution, especially when the sanction is denied. Section 17A creates new rights, disabilities 7 2021 SCC Online SC 3477 590 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and obligations and therefore it ought not to be applied retrospectively as held in G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana 8. (viii) Under the 2018 amendment, other than introducing Section 17A, other sections like Section 13 (1)(c) and 13(1)(d) i.e. the offences for which the appellant is charged, were specifically repealed and the offences were redefined. Section 17A can have no application to the offences as they existed prior to the 2018 amendment. (ix) Even if Section 17A of the PC Act were to be applicable to the present case, the IPC offences would survive and therefore also the FIR qua the appellant cannot be quashed. The question of competence of a particular court to try the offences would arise only after the investigation is complete and a chargesheet is filed. (x) When one of the co-accused has been charged under the offences under both the PC Act and the IPC, while the other co-accused have only been charged under the IPC, the Special Court would have jurisdiction to try both the accused persons in view of Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the PC Act. In the instant case 38 persons including multiple public servants have been arrayed as the accused in Crime No. 29 of 2021 before the AP CID Police Station, and therefore the Special Court under the PC Act has the jurisdiction to try all the accused involved in the case.
