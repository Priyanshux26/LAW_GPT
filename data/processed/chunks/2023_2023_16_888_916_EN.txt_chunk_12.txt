The Administrative Ministry has underline the need for building organised career management at par with GDOs of the CHS. To carry through the objectives of a separate Department of ISM&H, we recommend that an organised service, called the Central Indigenous & Homoeo Medical Service, may be constituted to include the 182 practitioners, and other physicians of these systems in the Ministry of Labour, Deptt. Of Coal, Armed Forces Ayurveda Dispensary and the Pharmacopoeia Labs of Indian Medicine and Homoeopathy, carrying medical qualifi cations 908 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. Parity with GDMOs 52.33 ISM&H Physicians have parity at entry level with Allopathic doctors. But for career progression they have to wait for vacancies. The Fourth CPC recommended parity of Physicians of ISM&H with GDOs of CHS, by upgrading existing post in the scale of Rs.650-1200 to Rs.2200-4000, provided that the incumbents possess degrees. The Tikku Committee also recommended similarly. But both were silent regarding career progression. The Consultancy Study as well as administrative Ministry have recommended that parity of ISM&H Physicians with Allopathic doctors. As specialisations are yet to emerge with concrete foundation in ISM&H, we recommend a general parity with GDOs as follows: Level Designation Scale Residency 3rd ACP Chief Medical Rs.4500-5700 - Offi cer (Selection Grade) 2nd ACP Chief Medical Rs.3700-5000 4 yrs. Offi cer 1st ACP Senior Rs.3000-4500 5 yrs. Medical Offi cer Entry Medical Rs.2200-4000 4 yrs. Offi cer Career progression beyond the selection grade will continue to be based on vacancies. Fourth CPC upgraded only DR. P.N. SHUKLA AND OTHERS v. UNION OF INDIA AND 909 OTHERS [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] those degree holders who were in the scale of Rs.650-1200 (pre-revised). The administrative Ministry has supported the demand for a general upgradation as was done by Third CPC for Allopathic Doctors and Fourth CPC for Veterinarians. As the educational requirement of the post are the same for MBBS doctors, we may recommend that all posts requiring medical practice in ISM&H and a degree in ISM&H as the minimum qualifi cation be placed in the entry scale of Rs.200-4000 and all the posts except those in Delhi Admn. be merged in the Central Indigenous & Homoeo Medical Service. Allowances 52.34. The Third CPC had recommended withdrawal of NPA from the ISM&H Doctors. However, the Fourth CPC granted it at rates at par with Allopathic Doctors. As the Physicians of ISM&H are equally concerned with Medical practices teaching and research, we recommend that allowances and facilities granted to GDOs of Allopathic stream should also be granted to Physicians of the ISM&H on the same terms and conditions.” 44.
