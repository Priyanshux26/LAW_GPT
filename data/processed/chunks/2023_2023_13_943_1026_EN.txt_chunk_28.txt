(3) In determining the costs, the Court or arbitral tribunal shall have regard to all the circumstances, including- (a) the conduct of all the parties; (b) whether a party has succeeded partly in the case; (c) whether the party had made a frivolous counterclaim leading to delay in the disposal of the arbitral proceedings; and (d) whether any reasonable off er to settle the dispute is made by a party and refused by the other party.

In the aforesaid context, we may refer to and rely upon a nine- Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Uber Technologies Inc., Uber Canada, Inc., Uber B.V. and Rasier Operations B.V. v. David Heller reported in 2020 SCC OnLine Can SC 13. We quote the relevant observations as under: “42. In our view, there are ways to mitigate this concern that make the overall calculus favour departing from the general rule of referring the matter to the arbitrator in these situations. Courts have many ways of preventing the misuse of court processes for improper ends. Proceedings that appear vexatious can be handled by requiring security for costs and by suitable awards of costs. In England, courts have awarded full indemnity costs where a party improperly ignored arbitral jurisdiction (Hugh Beale, ed., Chitty on Contracts (33rd ed. 2018), vol.

Fellowes International Holdings Limited, [2005] EWHC 1329 : 2005 WL 6514129 (Q.B. ), at paras. 43-44). Further, if the party who successfully enforced an arbitration agreement were to bring an action, depending on the circumstances they might be able to recover damages for breach of contract, that contract being the agreement to arbitrate (Beale, at para. 32-052; West Tankers Inc. v. Allianz SpA, [2012] EWHC 854 (Comm.) : [2012] 2 All ER 395 (Comm. ), at para. 77).” (Emphasis supplied) RE: ISSUE NO. 3 WHETHER THE VALIDITY OF THE PRE-DEPOSIT CONDITION AS CONTAINED IN CLAUSE 55 OF THE AGREEMENT CAN BE LOOKED INTO AND DECIDED ON THE ANVIL OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONSTITUTION IN A PETITION UNDER SECTION 11(6) OF THE ACT 1996?
