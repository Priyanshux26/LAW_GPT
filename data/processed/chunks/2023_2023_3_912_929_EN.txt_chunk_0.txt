912 SUPREME CO U [R20T2 3R]E 3P SO.RCT.RS. 912 [2023] 3 S.C.R. A RAVINDER KUMAR GOEL v. THE STATE OF HARYANA & ORS. (Civil Appeal No. 1173 of 2023) B FEBRUARY 15, 2023 [A. S. BOPANNA AND HIMA KOHLI, JJ.] Land Acquisition Act, 1894 : ss. 4, 6, 17(2) – Land Acquisition – Enhancement of compensation – On facts, land of the appellants acquired for the construction of Express Highway – Though land C acquired on large scale, however, the appellants were land owners of small extent of lands – Award passed and the market value fixed at Rs. 12,50,000/- per acre which was enhanced by the Reference Court to Rs. 43,17,841 and then by the High Court to Rs. 62,11,700/ - per acre – Thereafter, on remand of the matter to the Reference D Court, on re-appreciation of the evidence and materials available on record, the Reference Court determined the market value of the acquired lands at Rs.22,00,754/-, however, the High Court reduced the market value to Rs.14,52,010/- per acre – On appeal, held: High Court not justified in merely relying on the circular providing for the floor rates despite other evidence being available on record E – Reasoning assigned by the Reference Court in discarding the sale exemplars relied upon by the State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation since they depict the market value of the land which is lower than the amount awarded by the Collector, not justified – When large extent of lands are acquired and if the sale F exemplar, also for the large extent is available on record it would be safer to rely on the same if they are comparable transactions – Sale instances of smaller extents cannot be ignored – It can be relied upon subject to appropriate deduction being provided towards development charges – Since small extents of land belonging to the land losers, having non-agricultural potential in an urban area G was notified for acquisition, the sale exemplar dated 07.12.2004 can be considered as comparable – Reference Court justified in reckoning the same – Hence, it would be appropriate to reckon the deduction towards development cost at 25 per cent of the value taken into consideration under the document Ex. PX dated H 07.12.2004 – Thus, the market value would be Rs.25,20,000/- per 912 RAVINDER KUMAR GOEL v. THE STATE OF HARYANA 913 acre, payable with all statutory benefits as compensation for the A lands acquired – Furthermore, if any excess amount has been received by any of the land losers than the extent of the compensation determined herein, the excess amount, in any event, is recoverable. Partly allowing the appeals, the Court B HELD : 1.1 The Officer-cum-Land Acquisition Collector at the first instance while passing the award dated 10.05.2006 kept in view the circular dated 03.11.2005 issued by the Collector providing for the floor rates at Rs.12,50,000/-per acre and has, accordingly, determined the compensation. When the parties were before this Court in the first round of litigation, this Court having C taken note of the governing factors as to the determination of market value had remanded the matter for fresh consideration though the circular relating to the floor rates was also available to the benefit of this Court to be noticed and applied if need be.
