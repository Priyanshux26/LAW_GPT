It is incumbent upon the courts to uphold the sanctity of the legal framework governing stamp duty, as the same are crucial for the authenticity and enforceability of instruments. Allowing an instrument with insufficient stamp duty to pass unchallenged, merely due to technicalities, would undermine the legislative intent and the fiscal interests of the state. The courts ought to ensure that compliance with all substantive and procedural requirements of a statute akin to the 1957 Act are adhered to by the interested parties. This duty of the court is paramount, and any deviation would set a detrimental precedent, eroding the integrity of the legal system. Thus, the court must vigilantly prevent any circumvention of these legal obligations, ensuring due compliance and strict adherence for upholding the rule of law. 22. Having regard to the aforesaid discussion, we answer the substantial question in the affirmative. Finding no error in the of the Trial Court dated 19th October, 2010, we set aside the impugned of the High Court dated 26th September, 2011, meaning thereby that the of the Trial Court is restored. Since proceedings of the civil suit remained stalled because of pendency of this appeal, we expect the Trial Court to proceed expeditiously and in accordance with law. 23. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed without any for costs. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
