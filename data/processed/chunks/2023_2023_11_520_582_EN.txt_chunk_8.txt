Thus, from the aforesaid, it is evident that the District Collector, Kakinada District was subjectively satisfi ed based on the materials on record that the activities of the appellant detenu were prejudicial to the maintenance of public . According to the detaining authority i.e. the respondent No. 2, the appellant is a “bootlegger”as defi ned under Section 2(b) of the Act 1986 and with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public , it was felt necessary that the appellant be preventively detained. 6. The appellant detenu being aggrieved by the of preventive detention preferred Writ Petition No. 33638 of 2022 in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh seeking a writ of Habeas Corpus. The High Court vide its impugned declined to interfere and accordingly rejected the writ petition. 532 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 7. In such circumstances referred to above, the appellant is here before this Court with the present appeal. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 8. Ms. Bhabna Das, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant detenu, in her written submissions has stated thus:- “I. A Preventive Detention Can Only Be Issued For 3 Months At A Time 1.1 The Petitioner herein has been preventively detained in terms of an dated 25.08.2022 issued by the District Collector, Kakinada, under S. 3(2) of the AP Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Dacoits, Drug Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders and Land Grabbers Act, 1986 (the “AP Act”). While the dated 25.08.2022 did not specify any period of detention, the State Government, vide GO dated 18.10.2022, directed that the Petitioner shall be detained for a period of 12 months at a stretch. 1.2 The above s are contrary to the proviso to S. 3(2) of the AP Act, which states that “…the period specifi ed in the made by the Government under this sub-section shall not in the fi rst instance, exceed three months, but the Government may, if satisfi ed as aforesaid that it is necessary to do so, amend such to extend such period from time to time by any period not exceeding three months at any one time”. 1.3 This provision has been interpreted by this Hon’ble Court in Cherukuri Mani v. Chief Secretary, Government of Andhra Pradesh, (2015) 13 SCC 722, to mean that a detention can only be in force for 3 months in the fi rst instance. The Government can extend the period for not more than 3 months at a time so that there is periodic assessment and review as to whether continuous detention of a person is necessary. Consequently, a detention passed for 12 months at a stretch was quashed as being deterrent to the rights of the detenue [para 12-15]. This has subsequently been followed by this Hon’ble Court in dated 17.04.2017 in Criminal Appeal No. PESALA NOOKARAJU v. THE GOVERNMENT OF 533 ANDHRA PRADESH & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] 727/2017 titled ‘S. Penchalamma v. State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors.’ and Lahu Shrirang Gatkal v. State of Maharashtra, (2017) 13 SCC 519.
