The tribunal has no basis for assuming that the respondents would have acted in such a dishonest manner and thus, concludes that the respondents must have believed that the ACC unit was operating satisfactorily when it issued that certificate. The certificate states that the ACC unit was operating satisfactorily from May 2015. However, the tribunal does [2024] 9 S.C.R. 567 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. not rely on this date as it was not material to the purpose for which the certificate was required and was the date included in the draft certificate provided by the claimant. ………. (para 13.13 (f) of the award) 14). The tribunal concludes that all the criteria for issuing all three of the certificates listed above would have to be met before the ACC unit could be certified to be operating satisfactorily. The last alleged defects notified by Respondent no.1 in 2015, which has been exhibited, is dated 4th July 2015. (The fan assembly detached more than a year later, and that event could not have been the basis for withholding the relevant certificates through 2015). In its e-mail of 4th July 2015, Respondent no.1 notes gearbox defects but gave no details nor is the tribunal provided with any information about what action, if any, was taken in relation to the alleged gearbox defect. However, the tribunal is satisfied that on 4th July 2015 the ACC units were not yet in fit condition to merit the issue of the three relevant certificates. ………. (para 13.13 (g) of the award) 15). The first indication that the claimant thought it was ready for a performance guarantee test was in its e-mail dated 21st September 2015. There is no evidence to suggest that both the certificate on completion of punch points and takeover certificate of equipment should not have been issued on or before 21st September 2015. In the absence of any evidence from Respondent no.1 that there were any remaining punch points or that the ACC system was not capable of being taken over, the tribunal finds that these certificates are deemed to have been issued on 21st September 2015 a delay from the planned date of 539 days. ……(para 13.13 (h) of the award) 16). Equally, there is no further indication that the ACC unit was not capable of passing the PG test on 21st September 2015. However, a PG test can only be deemed satisfactory 568 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports if it is not carried out within 180 days of the issue of the taking over certificate. Accordingly, the PG test would be deemed to have been carried out satisfactorily only after a further 180 days had elapsed. Thus, the tribunal finds that the deemed achievement of Supplier’s liability in respect to Performance Guarantee Test pursuant to Clause 10.5 of Annexure A of the Erection Purchase only became effective on 19th March 2016. As the claimant was still requesting a PG test as late as 20th May 2016 the tribunal is satisfied that the deeming provisions apply and the ACC unit is deemed to have passed the PG test.
