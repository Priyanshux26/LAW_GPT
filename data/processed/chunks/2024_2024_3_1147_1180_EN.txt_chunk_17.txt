27. A Division Bench of this Court in Aveek Sarkar (supra) also quashed an FIR under Section 292 against the magazine cover of Sports World and Anandbazar Patrika that carried the image of Boris Becker, a tennis player, posing nude with his fiancée, who are an interracial couple. The Court held that while judging a photograph, article or 56 ibid, para 66 57 ibid, para 69 58 [2010] 5 SCR 322 : (2010) 5 SCC 600 : 2010 INSC 247 59 ibid, para 24 60 ibid, para 25 61 ibid, para 27 62 ibid, para 28 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1171 Apoorva Arora & Anr. Etc. v. State (Govt. of Nct of Delhi) & Anr. book to be obscene, “regard must be had to the contemporary mores and national standards and not the standard of a group of susceptible or sensitive persons”.63 The Court held that the Hicklin test must not be applied as it “judged for obscenity based on isolated passages of a work considered out of context and judged by their apparent influence on most susceptible readers, such as children or weak-minded adults.”64 Even in the United States, where the test was first formulated, the courts no longer apply the Hicklin test and instead apply the test formulated in Roth v. United States65 where the US Supreme Court held that sex-related material is obscene only when it has the tendency of exciting lustful thoughts when judged from the perspective of an average person by applying the community standards test. Similarly, in Canada, the dominant test is the ‘community standards problem test’ as per which a work qualifies as obscene when the exploitation of sex is its dominant characteristic and such exploitation is undue.66 Taking note of these jurisprudential developments, the Court in Aveek Sarkar markedly moved away from the Hicklin test to the “community standard test” where the material is considered as a whole to determine whether the specific portions have the tendency to deprave and corrupt.67 28. Applying this test, it was held that a picture of a nude/semi-nude woman is not per se obscene unless it arouses sexual desire or overtly reveals sexual desire or has the tendency of exciting lustful thoughts.68 In the present case, the posture and the background of the woman posing with her fiancée, whose photograph was taken by her father, does not have the tendency to deprave or corrupt those in whose hands the magazine would fall when considered in light of the broader social message of the picture against apartheid, racism, and to promote love and marriage across race.69 We may note that this Court followed the community standards test in Devidas Ramachandra Tuljapurkar (supra). 63 Aveek Sarkar (supra), para 18 64 ibid, para 20 65 354 US 476 (1957) 66 R v.
