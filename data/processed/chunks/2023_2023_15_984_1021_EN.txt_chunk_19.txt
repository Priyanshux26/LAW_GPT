Mrutunjay Pani v. Narmada Bala Sasmal [AIR 1961 SC 1353] , this Court observed that : (AIR p. 1355, para 5) “5. … The same principle is comprised in the Latin maxim commodum ex injuria sua nemo habere debet, that is, convenience cannot accrue to a party from his own wrong. To put it in other words, no one can be allowed to benefi t from his own wrongful act.” ××××× 324. In Mahadeo Savlaram Shelke v. Pune Municipal Corpn. [(1995) 3 SCC 33], it has been observed that the Court can under its inherent jurisdiction ex debito justitiae has a duty to mitigate the damage suff ered by the defendants by the act of the court. Such action is necessary to put a check on abuse of process of the court. In Amarjeet Singh v. Devi Ratan [(2010) 1 SCC 417 : (2010) 1 SCC (L&S) 1108], and Ram Krishna Verma [Ram Krishna Verma v. State of U.P., (1992) 2 SCC 620], it was observed that no person can suff er from the act of court and unfair advantage of the interim must be neutralised. In Amarjeet Singh [Amarjeet Singh v. Devi Ratan, (2010) 1 SCC 417 : (2010) 1 SCC (L&S) 1108], this Court observed : (SCC pp. 422-23, paras 17-18) “17. No litigant can derive any benefi t from mere pendency of the case in a court of law, as the interim always merges in the fi nal to be passed in the case, and if the writ petition is ultimately dismissed, the interim stands nullifi ed automatically. A party cannot be allowed to take any benefi t of its own wrongs by getting an interim and thereafter blame the court. The fact that the writ is found, ultimately, devoid of any merit, shows that a frivolous writ petition had been fi led. The maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit, which means that the act of the court shall prejudice no one, becomes applicable in such a case. In such a fact situation, the court is under an obligation to undo the wrong done to a party by the act of the court. Thus, any undeserved or unfair advantage gained by a party invoking the jurisdiction of the court must be neutralised, as the institution of litigation cannot be permitted to confer any advantage on a suitor from delayed action by the act of the court. (Vide Shiv Shankar v. U.P. SRTC [1995 Supp (2) SCC MUMTAZ YARUD DOWLA WAKF v. M/S BADAM 1011 BALAKRISHNA HOTEL PVT. LTD. & ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] 726 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 1018], GTC Industries Ltd. v. Union of India [(1998) 3 SCC 376] and Jaipur Municipal Corpn. v. C.L. Mishra [(2005) 8 SCC 423]). 18. In Ram Krishna Verma v. State of U.P. [(1992) 2 SCC 620], this Court examined a similar issue while placing reliance upon its earlier in Grindlays Bank Ltd. v. CIT [(1980) 2 SCC 191 : 1980 SCC (Tax) 230] and held that no person can suff er from the act of the court and in case an interim has been passed, and the petitioner takes advantage thereof, and ultimately the petition is found to be without any merit and is dismissed, the interest of justice requires that any undeserved or unfair advantage gained by a party invoking the jurisdiction of the court must be neutralised.” 325.
