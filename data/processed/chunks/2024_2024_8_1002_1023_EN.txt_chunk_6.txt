Moreover, the plea of the respondent that the mortgage was redeemed is factually 7 dated 28.08.2023 reads as below: “Heard learned counsel for the petitioner. After having perused the evidence of the petitioner- complainant, we are satisfied that the acquittal of the respondent is a possible conclusion, which could have been recorded by the High Court. Though, something can be said about the manner in which the findings have been recorded by the High Court, we are recording our findings after having perused the evidence of the complainant. Hence, we concur with the ultimate of the High Court and accordingly, the special leave petition stands dismissed. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.” [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1011 A.B. Govardhan v. P. Ragothaman incorrect. Another point not noted by the Division Bench is that the mortgage which took care of the return of Rs.8,50,000/- (Rupees Eight Lakhs Fifty Thousand), was never redeemed and initially, only re the two previous mortgages, the principal amount of Rs.1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Fifty Thousand) was returned, without the agreed interest. As noted above, subsequent to the passing of the Impugned s, in SA No.1235 of 2014, interim dated 25.08.2022 had directed the respondent to pay the appellant a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakhs), being the principal and interest on both the mortgages. This stood complied with and the SA was dismissed as having become infructuous on 24.01.2023. 23. However, the Agreement envisaged property worth Rs.9,00,000/- (Rupees Nine Lakhs) out of the total claimed due of Rs. 11,00,000/- (Rupees Eleven Lakhs), being registered in favour of the appellant or his nominee. The Agreement also stipulated that after redeeming the earlier/previous mortgages, the respondent would re-mortgage for the purpose of raising Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs). Thereafter, the said sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs) would be paid to the appellant. The said condition was not followed through i.e., no Sale Deed was executed and registered, nor was the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs) paid. We are of the view that in such a case, it was well-within the competence of the appellant to move the Court, which he did by instituting the suit. 24. Another factor is that the appellant was not heard in the appeal, as recorded in the First Impugned itself. Undoubtedly, in the face of non-appearance by the appellant before it, the Division Bench was free to proceed with final hearing of the appeal, as it did. However, what seems to have transpired is that in the absence of the appellant, what was averred by the respondent in the appeal was accepted as correct by the Division Bench. Fact remained that the respondent admitted to having executed Exhibit P-1 (the Agreement) and that the signature(s) thereon were his, in the Proof Affidavit dated 01.03.2010 as also cross-examination dated 08.03.2010. No doubt, he (respondent) has denied its voluntary execution and contended that it was under coercion and threat, but no evidence was brought or led by him to support this plea. The Division Bench opined, correctly, that “It is true that there was no supporting evidence adduced by him to show as to how he was threatened and forced to execute Ex.P1.” Pausing here, we may emphasise that for every fact 1012 [2024] 8 S.C.R.
