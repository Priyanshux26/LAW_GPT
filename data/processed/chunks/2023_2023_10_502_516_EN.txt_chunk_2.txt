Therefore, there is no inclination to hold at this juncture that the prosecution has not established a prima- facie case as to the guilt of the accused. One of the prosecution witnesses, namely N turned hostile. Therefore, in the absence of F any evidence as to the circumstances under which she turned hostile, it cannot be ruled out the possibility of the respondents- accused influencing other witnesses, tampering with the evidence, if they continue to remain on bail. The present case is not one where the accused have been detained in custody for an inordinate amount of time as under-trials. The High Court in the G impugned s did not consider the said aspects of the case in the context of the grant of bail. The High Court has been swayed by the fact that one of the prosecution witnesses, namely, N has turned hostile which is not an aspect that must be taken into account while considering an application for bail. [Para 24][515- H C-H; 516-A] ROHIT BISHNOI v. THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN & ANR. 505 1.6 A Court considering the grant of bail must not engage A in an elaborate discussion on the merits of the case, that the High Court while passing the impugned s did not take into account even a single material aspect of the case. Instead, the High Court referred only to the testimony of one hostile witness in the trial and on the basis thereof, exercised its discretion to B grant bail in an erroneous manner. The High Court lost sight of the said vital aspects of the case and granted bail to the respondents-accused by passing very cryptic and casual s, de hors cogent reasoning. [Para 25][516-B-C] 1.7 Having considered the facts of the instant case it is not C a fit case for the grant of bail to the respondents-accused, given the seriousness of the allegations against them. The High Court was not right in allowing the applications for bail filed by the respondents-accused. Hence, the impugned s passed by the High Court are set aside.
