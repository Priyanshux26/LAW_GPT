96. The proceedings under Section 28 are subsequent to the completion of the process set out in Section 17 of the Act, 1962. The procedure envisaged under Section 28 is in the nature of a quasi-judicial proceeding with the issuance of the show cause notice by the proper officer followed by adjudication of such notices by the field customs officers. It is also worth noting that in the case of DRI, the proceedings under Section 28 start only after an investigation has been undertaken by DRI. This is reaffirmed by Circular No. 4/99-Cus dated 15.02.1999 and Circular No. 44/2011-Customs dated 23.11.2011. Therefore, the nature of review under Section 28 is significantly different from the nature of assessment and re-assessment under Section 17. The ambit of Section 28 has also been restricted to the review of assessments and re-assessments done under Section 17 for ascertaining if there has been a short-levy, non-levy, part-payment, non-payment or erroneous refund. 97. Keeping this statutory scheme in mind, we are unable to subscribe to the view taken in both Sayed Ali (supra) and Canon India (supra), namely, that the vesting of the functions of assessment and re- assessment under Section 17 is a threshold, mandatory condition for a proper officer to perform functions under Section 28. This scheme does not flow from the scheme of the statute and was judicially read in to avoid the possibility of chaos and confusion due to the potential for multiple proper officers exercising jurisdiction under Section 28. We find that such apprehensions of misuse are unfounded considering that no substantial empirical evidence has been brought forth by the respondents in this case to support such a view. Regardless, the the parameters under Section 28 cannot be reduced to an administrative review of assessment/re-assessment done under Section 17. 98. We are conscious of the fact that Section 110AA of the Act, 1962, which has been introduced by the Finance Act, 2022, stipulates that a show cause notice under Section 28 of the Act, 1962 can only be issued by that “proper officer” who has been conferred with the jurisdiction, by an assignment of functions under Section 5 of the Act, 1962, [2024] 12 S.C.R. 279 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. to conduct assessment under Section 17 of the Act in respect of such duty. However, we are of the view that the introduction of Section 110AA doesn’t alter the statutory scheme of Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 as it stood prior to the introduction of Section 110AA. The legislature in its wisdom may introduce certain new provisions keeping in mind the exigencies of administration and taking into account the evolution of law. However, this would not by itself mean that the procedure which was being followed prior to the introduction of such changes was incorrect or in contravention of the law. The legality and correctness of an action has to be adjudged based on the statutory scheme prevailing at the time when such action took place, and incorrectness or invalidity cannot be imputed to it on the basis of subsequent changes in law.
