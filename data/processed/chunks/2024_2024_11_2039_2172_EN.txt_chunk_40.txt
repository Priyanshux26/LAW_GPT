Further, Para 21 of the same stated that, “…The impugned of the NCLAT, on the other hand, allowed the plea 2100 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of the SRA for adjustment and consequential release of the PBG at the interlocutory stage. This prima facie would not be in accordance with the tenor of paragraph 8 of the affidavit…”. Therefore, it was submitted that the directions issued by this Court only related to a scenario were the SRA sought benefit of the offer made in the Lender’s Affidavit. 61. The counsel submitted that the NCLAT in its impugned dealt with this Court’s dated 18.01.2024 at length and concluded that the direction issued by this Court to deposit the amount of Rs. 150 Crore peremptorily on or before 31.01.2024 was in reference to the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023. Meaning thereby, the of the NCLAT dated 28.08.2023 to adjust the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore was substituted by the direction of the Supreme Court. Therefore, the SRA would render itself disentitled to take benefit of the offer of the Appellant that they would withdraw the Company Appeal and the appeals before the Supreme Court. As such, the pending Company Appeal was to be heard on merits and decided in accordance with law by the NCLAT. In short, the entire issue before this Court was confined to an interpretation as to how the condition of Rs. 150 Crore in the affidavit was to be interpreted and if the condition was complied with, the Appeals would stand withdrawn, if not, they would be decided on their own merits. 62. It was further submitted that the NCLAT rightly observed that, the submission of the Appellant that the Corporate Debtor should be directed to be liquidated on account of non-deposit of Rs. 150 Crore, cannot be accepted since the Supreme Court neither considered nor expressed any opinion on the question of liquidation. Liquidation was never recorded as a consequence and this is evident from liquidation not being mentioned in; (a) the arguments of the Appellants recorded by the NCLAT in its dated 28.08.2023, (b) the of the NCLAT dated 28.08.2023, (c) the arguments of the Appellants recorded by this Court in its dated 18.01.2024 and, the findings or the directions of this Court in its dated 18.01.2024. 63. The counsel also submitted that the adjustment of the PBG against the first tranche payment was possible under the Resolution Plan, specifically under Clause 6.4.4 which sets out the “Summary of payments and security package”. It is evident through Clause 6.4.4 that a revolving package was agreed against each tranche of the [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2101 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. payment under the Resolution Plan. For the first tranche of payment, the security package comprises of the PBG and one of the Dubai Properties and it is stated that the PBG will be adjusted against the first tranche payment. For subsequent tranches of payment, the security package does not include the PBG and instead includes other types of security.
