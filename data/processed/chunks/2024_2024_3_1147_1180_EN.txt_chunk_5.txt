The High Court held that the depiction of a sexually explicit act is not necessarily through filming but can also be through spoken language. It was found that the persons who are likely to be affected or persons whom such content can deprave or corrupt are impressionable minds in the present case, as there is no disclaimer or warning that classifies the web-series as being suitable only for persons who are 18 years or above. The content crossed the threshold of decency considering its availability to the public, including children. Further, the Court felt that the episode could not be heard in the courtroom without shocking or alarming the people and to maintain the decorum of language. 5. Second, a representation that the language used in the episode is the one used in the country and by its youth in educational institutions is not protected under the guarantee of freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a). Third, that the online content curator and the intermediaries 9 [2014] 2 SCR 263 : (2014) 4 SCC 257 : 2014 INSC 75 10 G. Venkateswara Rao v. State of AP in Writ Petition 1420 of 2020; Jaykumar Bhagwanrao Gore v. State of Maharashtra 2017 SCC OnLine Bom 7283; Pramod Anand Dhumal v. State of Maharashtra 2021 SCC OnLine Bom 34; Ekta Kapoor v. State of MP 2020 SCC OnLine MP 4581, as cited in paras 23-26 of the impugned . 11 In para 37 of the impugned , the High Court relied on Samaresh Bose v. Amal Mitra [1985] Suppl. 3 SCR 17 : (1985) 4 SCC 289 : 1985 INSC 205 where it was held that the regard must be given to contemporary morals and national standards in judging whether content is obscene. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1155 Apoorva Arora & Anr. Etc. v. State (Govt. of Nct of Delhi) & Anr. are in violation of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 as the content has not been correctly classified as ‘A-rated’ and there is no warning regarding the use of profanities and expletives. Lastly, the Court took note that vulgar language, profanities, and swear words must be regulated in the public domain and on social media platforms as they are a threat to impressionable minds like children of tender age. Further, a representation that the use of such language in general parlance is the “new normal” is a distortion of facts as it is still not spoken in the presence of the elderly, women and children, or at religious places. To maintain linguistic morality, the sanctity and reverence of languages must be protected. 6. The High Court also rejected the appellants’ contention that the mandatory procedure under Section 154(3) of the CrPC, which is an important procedural safeguard, was not followed before resort to Section 156(3). The High Court preliminarily negatived this submission by holding that Section 154(3) only uses the term “may” and not “shall”, and that the complainant anyways approached the ACP, Cyber Cell, North District, who is the authority higher to the SHO.
