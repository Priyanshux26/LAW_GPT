A Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation. after 13-07-1982 in respect of the plots/land saturated in the Industrial Areas and transferred to the said Corporation shall be deemed to be valid under the first proviso to this rule.” 12. In the backdrop of these amendments, confusion arose regarding whether Rules 11A and 12 of the 1959 Rules would be B applicable prospectively or retrospectively. In this context, a clarification was sought by the District Collector, Kota, through a letter dated 15.05.1986. The Collector was referring in this context to the deposit of lease rent and to whom the rent in question should go: “Therefore, guide in this regard that the above-mentioned C notification dated 13-07-1982, the lease rent etc. of the land allotted to the factory will be deposited by RIICO or deposited in the erstwhile tehsil itself s a state item. Please send guidance in this regard soon. Till the guidance is received the decision has been taken to deposit the lease amount in the Tehsil. Photocopy of the D form letter is also being sent from M/s J K Synthetic in this regard. Signature District collector, Kota Number:- F-8 (198) Revenue/4435-38 E Dt. 15-05-86" x---------------------------------x--------------------------------------x 13. In response to this, a notification was issued by the State Government on 23.05.1987, clarifying that Rule 12 of the 1959 Rules, added on 13.07.1982, would not apply retrospectively and the lease rent F and other items pertaining to different deeds would remain a state subject. “Rajasthan Government Revenue (Group-4) Department Sr. No. 2 (242) Rajasthan/3/86Jaipur, Dated 23.05.1987 G Sent:- District Collector, Kota.

This seemed to remove whatever doubts, if any, and clarified C explicitly that the amendments to the 1959 Rules, of which Rules 11A and 12 are important for us to keep in mind, were prospectively applicable. The management and control of the lands leased out under the 1959 Rules, were apparently not handed over to RIICO. This understanding was enunciated in a Government Circular dated 12.01.1995 which indicates that revenue records would reflect that ownership and the right D to administer the land remained with the State Government. Further, documents in this regard would be retained by the District Industries Centre, and not RIICO: “Government of Rajasthan Industries (Group-1) Department E 1.
