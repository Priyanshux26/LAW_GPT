Consequently, the Select List prepared on 02.04.2022 was impliedly set aside and a Final Select List was prepared by the BTSC in compliance with dated 19.04.2022 but the same was not released as ed by the Patna High Court vide dated 01.12.2022 in another analogous writ proceeding being CWJC No. 7761/2022 as under: “…Process of selection and appointment, in terms of advertisement dated 8.9.2019, is nearing completion. Under these circumstances, as prayed for, we grant two weeks’ time to file reply. In the meanwhile, process of selection may carry on, but the result shall not be declared without leave of the Court.” 24. It is pertinent to note that the dated 19.04.2022 passed in CWJC No. 7312 of 2021 does not appear to have been challenged further and has attained finality. It is stated by the BTSC that the Final Select List was prepared and kept under sealed cover. While an application seeking release of the list was pending before the High Court, the Writ Petition was withdrawn. 25. During the present proceedings, vide dated 10.09.2024, this Court sought information regarding the Final Select List from the State Government and the same was produced before this Court in sealed cover. 26. Presently, despite the preparation of the Final Select List which signals the conclusion of the appointment process, the State Government seeks to scrap the entire process and undertake a fresh appointment process under the New Rules. In the considered opinion of this Court, this amounts to effectively changing the rules of the game after the game was played which is impermissible and 1356 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports deprives the candidates of their legitimate right of consideration under the previous Rules. 27. The High Court in the impugned has abruptly and without assigning reasons and without adjudicating any issues involved in the writ petitions, disposed of the same, recording the statement made by the learned counsel for the State, and permitted the State to amend Rules in question. Since, the entire recruitment process was concluded as per the extant Rules till the selection list was declared on 02.04.2022, which has not been specifically set aside by the High Court, and since the AICTE has also continued its stand that its approval is not necessary for the private institutions, and since the dated 19.04.2022 passed in CWJC No. 7312/2021 has attained finality, in our opinion, the interest of justice would be met if the State/Commission is directed to prepare a fresh select list of meritorious candidates in respect of the Advertisement dated 08.03.2019, keeping in view the above facts and keeping in view that no appointments to the post of Junior Engineer (Civil) have been made since last more than ten years. Hence, it is required to be directed that a fresh selection list for the vacancies advertised in the Advertisement dated 08.03.2019 be prepared of the meritorious candidates, considering the above observations and in compliance with the dated 19.04.2022 passed by the High Court in CWJC No.
