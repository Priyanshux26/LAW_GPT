We have heard Shri S.V. Raju, learned Additional Solicitor General of India (“ASG” for short) appearing for the Appellant-Board and Shri Amir Arsiwala, Advocate on Record, appearing for the Respondents/ Ex-Directors of the Corporate Debtor. 4. Shri S.V. Raju, learned ASG submitted that the learned Single Judge of the High Court has grossly erred in quashing the proceedings. Shri Raju submitted that the learned Single Judge of the High Court has grossly erred in holding that, in view of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2017 (which came into effect from 7th May 2018), only the offences committed under the Companies Act can be tried by Special Court consisting of Sessions Judge or Additional Sessions Judge. He submitted that the reasoning given by the learned Single Judge that the offences other than the Companies Act cannot be tried by the Special Court consisting of Sessions Judge or Additional Sessions Judge is totally in ignorance of the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 236 of the Code. 5. Learned ASG submitted that sub-section (1) of Section 236 of the Code provides that the offences under the Code shall be tried by the Special Court established under Chapter XXVIII of the Companies Act, 2013. He submits that the legislative intent is clear. There is no general reference to the provisions of the Companies Act.

Shri Raju further submitted that the legislative intent is clear. A specific provision of the Companies Act, 2013 has been incorporated in sub- section (1) of Section 236 of the Code.
