Since the recovery on the basis of mortgaged property had already been effected by way of sale dated 16.12.1999 the remaining amount could not be recovered beyond the limited time of three years” Contentions of the Parties 6. Before us, learned counsel for the appellants contend that the in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) directly covers the issue [2024] 6 S.C.R. 243 K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited & Ors. as according to them, in substance, there is no difference between the provisions of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act, with which V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) was concerned, and the Recovery of Dues Act of the State of Haryana. According to the learned counsel, V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) has clearly held that Acts, like the Recovery of Dues Act, are intended for speedy recovery of loans and do not create a new right in the creditor. It is their contention that on that reasoning the word “due” in the Recovery of Dues Act cannot be interpreted to include time-barred debts. 7.
