These petitions for special leave to appeal seek to lay a challenge to the and dated 7th November 2019 passed in C.O.Nos.1582-85 of 2019 by the High Court of Calcutta. The learned Single Judge while deciding the issue as to whether the West Bengal Tenancy Act, 19971 or the Transfer of Property Act, 18822 was to be applied for framing of the issues in the instant landlord-tenant dispute, held that the Tenancy Act would govern the same. 2. Impugning the of the learned Single Judge, the present Special Leave Petitions were filed before this Court. However, the reasoning adopted therein is not within the scope of the present adjudication. During the pendency of these Special Leave Petitions 1 Tenancy Act 2 T.P. Act 862 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports interlocutory applications have been filed seeking direction for payment of rent and other associated benefits in connection with the property which is the subject matter of the present dispute. It is these Interlocutory Applications that are sought to be disposed of by way of the present . 3. It would, however, be apposite to have a bird’s eye view of the controversy. It is not in dispute that the lis governs four different tenancies. Due to alleged non- payment of rent, the lease was forfeited, and the petitioner-applicant initiated proceedings for ejectment under the T.P. Act. Suit(s) were filed before the City Civil Court at Calcutta seeking inter alia, a) recovery of possession by eviction of defendant (respondent- tenant herein); b) permanent injunction against the present respondents and his agents, servants, employees or associates etc., from alienating, transferring or parting with possession of the property.
