For that, it will be necessary to refer to various s passed by the tribunals as well as the High Court.” (Emphasis supplied) CELIR LLP v. BAFNA MOTORS (MUMBAI) PVT. 129 LTD. & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] (ii) The amendment to Section 13(8) is subsequent in point of time and came into eff ect from 01.09.2016. Thus, there was no scope for any discussion on the amendment of Section 13(8) in S. Karthik (supra). Strikingly, Shakeena (supra) though arising from an auction prior to amendment in Section 13(8) yet has taken notice of the amendment of Section 13(8). The relevant para of Shakeena (supra) is as under:- “30. A fortiorari, it must follow that the appellants have failed to exercise their right of redemption in the manner known to law, much less until the registration of the sale certifi cate on 18-9-2007. In that view of the matter no relief can be granted to the appellants, assuming that the appellants are right in contending that as per the applicable provision at the relevant time [unamended Section 13(8) of the 2002 Act], they could have exercised their right of redemption until the registration of the sale certifi cate — which, indisputably, has already happened on 18-9-2007. Therefore, it is not possible to countenance the plea of the appellants to reopen the entire auction process. This is more so because, the narrative of the appellants that they had made a valid tender towards the subject loan accounts before registration of the sale certifi cate, has been found to be tenuous. Thus understood, their right of redemption in any case stood obliterated on 18-9-2007. Further, the amended Section 13(8) of the 2002 Act which has come into force w.e.f. 1-9-2016, will now stare at the face of the appellants. As per the amended provision, stringent condition has been stipulated that the tender of dues to the secured creditor together with all costs, charges and expenses incurred by him shall be at any time before the “date of publication of notice” for public auction or inviting quotations or tender from public or private deed for transfer by way of lease assessment or sale of the secured assets. That event happened before the institution of the subject writ petitions by the appellants.” (Emphasis supplied) (iii) S. Karthik (supra) has followed Mathew Varghese’s case and hence not elaborated on the provisions, more particularly Section 13(8). Further Mathew Varghese’s case was decided prior to the amendment in Section 13(8). [See relevant para of S. Karthik (supra)] “39. This Court in Mathew Varghese [Mathew Varghese v. M. Amritha Kumar, (2014) 5 SCC 610 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 254] has elaborately 130 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. considered the provisions of Sections 13(1), 13(8), 35 and 37 of the SARFAESI Act so also Rules 8 and 9 of the said Rules. We, therefore, do not wish to burden the present by reproducing all those provisions since they have already been reproduced and considered in Mathew Varghese [Mathew Varghese v. M. Amritha Kumar, (2014) 5 SCC 610 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 254].
