A Nath Wahal v. State of U.P., (2011) 12 SCC 769] and the High Court earlier thereto. As a fact, on the expiry of the initial period of the grant after 29-9-1959, they lost the right to obtain renewal or to ply their vehicles, as this Court declared the scheme to be operative. However, by sheer abuse of the process of law, they B are continuing to ply their vehicles pending the hearing of the objections. This Court in Grindlays Bank Ltd. v. CIT [Grindlays Bank Ltd. v. CIT, (1980) 2 SCC 191 : 1980 SCC (Tax) 230] held that the High Court, while exercising its power under Article 226, the interest of C justice requires that any undeserved or unfair advantage gained by a party invoking the jurisdiction of the court must be neutralised. It was further held that the institution of the litigation by it should not be permitted to confer an unfair advantage on the party responsible for it. In the light of that law and in view of the power under D Article 142(1) of the Constitution this Court, while exercising its jurisdiction would do complete justice and neutralise the unfair advantage gained by the 50 operators including the appellants in dragging the litigation to run the stage carriages on the approved route or area or E portion thereof and forfeited their right to hearing of the objections filed by them to the draft scheme dated 26-2- 1959.” 172. This Court in Kavita Trehan v. Balsara Hygiene Products Ltd. [Kavita Trehan v. Balsara Hygiene Products Ltd., (1994) 5 SCC 380] observed as under : (SCC p. 391, F para 22) “22. The jurisdiction to make restitution is inherent in every court and will be exercised whenever the justice of the case demands. It will be exercised under inherent powers, where the case did not strictly fall within the G ambit of Section 144. Section 144 opens with the words: ‘144. Application for restitution.—(1) Where and insofar as a decree or an is varied or reversed in any appeal, revision or other proceeding or is set aside or modified in any suit instituted for the H purpose,….’ BHUPINDER SINGH v. UNITECH LIMITED 963 [M. R. SHAH, J.] The instant case may not strictly fall within the terms of A Section 144, but the aggrieved party in such a case can appeal to the larger and general powers of restitution inherent in every court.” 173. This Court in Marshall Sons & Co. (India) Ltd. v. Sahi Oretrans (P) Ltd. [Marshall Sons & Co. (India) Ltd. B v. Sahi Oretrans (P) Ltd., (1999) 2 SCC 325] observed as under : (SCC pp. 326-27, para 4) “4. From the narration of the facts, though it appears to us, prima facie, that a decree in favour of the appellant is not being executed for some reason or the C other, we do not think it proper at this stage to direct the respondent to deliver the possession to the appellant since the suit filed by the respondent is still pending.
