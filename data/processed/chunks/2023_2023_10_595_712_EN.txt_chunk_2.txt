Practice and Procedure – Disclosure of Relevant Material – G Open Justice – Sealed cover procedure – Effect of – Less Restrictive Means – Public interest immunity claim – Suggestive Course of Action – Held: Sealed cover procedures violate both principles of natural justice and open justice – When relevant material is disclosed in a sealed cover, there are two injuries that are perpetuated – First, the H 598 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A documents are not available to the affected party – Second, the documents are relied upon by the opposite party (which is most often the State) in the course of the arguments, and the court arrives at a finding by relying on the material – In such a case, the affected party does not have any recourse to legal remedies because it would be unable to (dis)prove any inferences from the material before the B adjudicating authority – This form of adjudication perpetuates a culture of secrecy and opaqueness, and places the beyond the reach of challenge – The affected party would be unable to “contradict errors, identify omissions, challenge the credibility of informants or refute false allegations” – The right to seek judicial C review which has now been read into Arts. 14 and 21 is restricted – A corresponding effect of the sealed cover procedure is a non- reasoned – If the purpose could be realised effectively by public interest immunity proceedings or any other less restrictive means, then the sealed cover procedure should not be adopted – The court should undertake an analysis of the possible procedural D modalities that could be used to realise the purpose, and the means that are less restrictive of the procedural guarantees must be adopted – The courts could take the course of redacting confidential portions of the document and providing a summary of the contents of the document to fairly exclude materials after a successful public interest E immunity claim. Practice and Procedure – Difference between sealed cover procedure and public interest immunity claims – Held: One crucial difference between the sealed cover procedure and public interest immunity claims is that in the former, the court relies on the material F that is disclosed in a sealed cover in the course of the proceedings, as opposed to the latter where the documents are completely removed from the proceedings and both the parties and the adjudicator cannot rely on such material – The courts assess the validity of public interest immunity claims, which address the same harms as the sealed cover procedure, based on the structured proportionality standard G – The power of courts to secure material in a sealed cover when contradistinguished with the scope of assessment of public interest immunity claims is rather unguided and ad-hoc – The standard of review that is used by the courts in public interest immunity claims and the lack of such a standard in sealed cover proceedings to H MADHYAMAM BROADCASTING LIMITED v.
