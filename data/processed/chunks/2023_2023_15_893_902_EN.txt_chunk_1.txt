[Paras 8-11, 15] Labour Laws – Suspension – Relationship of master and servant – Plea of the workman that being on suspension, he could not have been treated to have been voluntarily retired as per the deeming provision: Held: Said plea is rejected, as during his suspension also, the relationship of master and servant does not come to an end – All the rules and regulations governing the post continue to apply – Merely because the Bank had stopped paying subsistence allowance to the workman does not mean that the workman was no more an employee of the Bank – The action was taken by the Bank only to ensure that somehow or the other, the workman joined his duty – However, it seems that he had some other scheme in his mind – The idea seems to be to lay a claim on all his wages – Initially, to get subsistence allowance without working and then claim reinstatement and back wages – If Clause XVI in the U.P. SINGH v. PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK 895 Bipartite Agreement is seen, the workman could have been treated to have been voluntarily retired immediately upon expiry of 90 days from 28.09.1983 as he had failed to join duty – Letter dtd.05.01.1984 issued by the Bank was duly acknowledged by him in his communication but still he failed to join duty and continued writing letters – Despite this fact, the Bank was magnanimous enough to have issued a fi nal notice to him on 05.10.1984, granting him 30 days’ time to report for duty, as also acknowledged by the workman – But he failed to comply with the same.
