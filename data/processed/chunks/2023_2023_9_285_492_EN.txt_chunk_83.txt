[AJAY RASTOGI, J.] appointment of arbitrator. According to him, an instrument would exist in A law only when it is enforceable and “existence” defined in Section 11(6A) of the Act, 1996 in respect of an arbitration agreement, has to be a valid enforceable agreement and it is always open to examine the issue of non-stamping or of insufficiently stamped at the initial/pre-referral stage itself and further highlighting three modes as provided in M/s. N.N. Global B Mercantile Private Limited (supra) i.e. impounding, payment of stamp duty and appointment of arbitrator, on an application filed underSection 11 of the Act, 1996, the Court is certainly “acting upon” the arbitration clause which is contended to be barred by the clear expression of Section 35 of the Act, 1899 and an Agreement, unless enforceable by law, cannot be termed to be in existence under Section 11(6A) of the Act, 1996. C 23. Ms. Malvika Trivedi, learned senior counsel, who appears for the intervenor in I.A. No.18516 of 2022, submits that the regimes of the Act, 1899 and Act, 1908 are completely different. M/s. N.N. Global Mercantile Private Limited (supra) wrongly applied the principles of registration of a document to the requirement of stamping a document. D While the former is a curable defect, the latter determines the very existence and completion of a document/instrument. In the absence of registration, an instrument shall remain in existence but without stamping, the instrument is incomplete/inchoate. 24. Ms. Trivedi further submits that the Act, 1899 envisages the E payment of stamp duty, failing which the instrument, according to her, cannot be acted upon for any purpose and there is no ambiguity in the language of the Statute and we have to follow the golden principles ofinterpretation of the Statute. 25. Ms. Trivedi further submits that the powers of the Court under F different provisions of law as well as the restrictions created in the Act, 1899 apply to the proceedings conducted in accordance with Section 9 of the Act, 1996 and submits that even if the arbitration clause stands severed, the Court will have to reach a prima facie conclusion as to whether the substantive contract which contained the clause of arbitration G is enforceable in law before granting interim measures invoking Section 9 of the Act, 1996. 26. Mr. Debesh Panda, learned counsel for the Intervenor in I.A. No. 199969 of 2022 submits that Part I of Act, 1996 deals with Sections 8, 9 and 11, whereas Section 45 is dealt within Part II. Section 45 has H 396 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A been recognized as a provision under Part II which is a complete code. The expression “unless it finds” in Section 45 was interpreted by majority in Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v Aksh Optifibre Ltd. and Another10 as a consideration on a prima facie basis. In 2019, Parliament amended Section 45 by substituting the expression “unless it finds” with “unless it prima facie finds”, that brings the statute in line with the position settled B in Shin Etsu (supra).
