This finding of material contribution was sufficient to render the defendant fully liable for the damages flowing from the disc herniation. 45 The finding of material contribution was not unreasonable. Although the plaintiff had experienced back problems before the accidents, there was no evidence of herniation or insult to the disc and no history of complaints of sciatica. When a plaintiff has two accidents which both cause serious back injuries, and shortly thereafter suffers a disc herniation during a mild exercise which he frequently performed prior to the accidents, it seems reasonable to infer a causal connection. 772 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 46 The trial judge found that the plaintiff’s condition was improving when the herniation occurred, but this also means that the plaintiff was still to some extent suffering from the back injuries from the accidents. The inference of causal link was supported by medical evidence and was reasonable. 47 This appeal involves a straightforward application of the thin skull rule. The pre- existing disposition may have aggravated the injuries, but the defendant must take the plaintiff as he finds him. If the defendant’s negligence exacerbated the existing condition and caused it to manifest in a disc herniation, then the defendant is a cause of the disc herniation and is fully liable.  Let us now turn to, illustratively, the application of this rule in the USA. Richard Posner J., speaking for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in James E. Niehus and Denise Niehus v. Vince Liberio and Frank Vittorio24, noted as hereinbelow: “Niehus was sufficiently drunk when his car was struck that he mightn’t have felt the pain of a broken cheekbone. But at least according to the defendants’ lawyer he had (though this seems improbable) sobered up a lot by the time the altercation in the station house began several hours later, yet still he said nothing about a pain in his cheek until after the fight. The doctors testified as we said that the break was consistent with a kick though it could of course have been caused by Niehus’s striking his head against the door of the car in the accident. If the jury believed, as it had every right to do, that Niehus was kicked in the left side of his face by the 24 973 F.2d 526 (7th Cir. 1992) [2024] 4 S.C.R. 773 Jyoti Devi v. Suket Hospital & Ors. defendants, the fact that the cheekbone might have been broken already would not help the defendants. If you kick a person’s freshly broken cheekbone you are likely to aggravate the injury substantially, and the “eggshell skull” or “thin skull” rule, would make the officers liable for the full consequences of their kicks even if, had it not been for a preexisting injury, the consequences would have been much less injurious. Oddly, the leading “eggshell skull” case also involved a kick.”  We may also refer to another instance, from the same Court. In Lancaster v. Norfolk and Western Ry.
