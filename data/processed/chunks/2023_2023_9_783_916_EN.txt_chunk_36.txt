Therefore, according to the Appellate Tribunal, a ‘related party’ could be treated as a separate class independent of an unrelated party and ought to be equated with the promoters as equity shareholders or as partners. After discussing various decisions of NCLT C and NCLAT as also of this Court as regards the position of related party vis-à-vis the unrelated, the Appellate Authority held that the related party financial or operational creditor cannot be discriminated against under the resolution plan, by denying their right to get payments under the resolution plan only for being a related party. The Appellate Tribunal observed and held as under: - D “149. Under the IBC, 2016, there is no mandate to treat unrelated and related parties equally. On the contrary, the IBC and Regulations thereunder specifically treat ‘related party’ as a class unto itself and restrict the involvement of a ‘related party’ in any situation where the CIRP is likely to get affected. As held by the E Hon’ble Supreme Court in Phoenix ARC, the purpose is to ensure that external creditors drive the CIRP. Following statutory provisions clarify that related party’ is a class in itself. Accordingly, a related party is prohibited from acting in any of the following capacities in a CIRP: F G H M. K. RAJAGOPALAN v. DR. PERIASAMY PALANI 835 GOUNDER & ANR. [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] 150. The underlying object is that the involvement of a related A party in the CIRP in any capacity is seen as giving unfair benefit to the Corporate Debtor. In short, a related party is treated in the same class as the Corporate Debtor itself. 151. Therefore, this statutory recognition as a different class would apply even to a Resolution Plan when the CoC decides whether, B in its commercial wisdom, it should pay to a related party at all as this would mean paying to the same persons who are behind the Corporate Debtor. *** *** *** C 157. Thus, it is well-settled that a ‘related party’ can be treated as a separate class independent of an unrelated party. Such ‘related party’ ought to be equated with the promoters as ‘equity shareholders as partners. *** *** *** D 162. In the instant case of approved resolution plan discriminates between related party unsecured Financial Creditor and other unsecured Financial Creditors, likewise related party operational creditors and other operational creditors. The appellant argues that its claim ought to be treated equally to an unrelated Operational/ Financial Creditor given the equality clause enshrined under Article E 14 of the Constitution of India. *** *** *** 171. It is important to mention that related parties are barred from participating in the COC to avoid sabotaging the COC. Per contra, F the claim filed by the related party, based on their admitted claims, would have influenced the CIRP if they had been permitted to participate in the COC. After completion of the CIRP and after approval of the Resolution Plan, if any amount is allotted to related party financial or operational creditors, it would not impact the CIRP.
