Sections 49A and 49B were inserted in the 1960 Act by way of U.P. Act 28 of 1971. Therefore, the sale deed dated 26.09.1974 by F Qasim Ali Khan in favour of his nephew, being in the teeth of the prohibition against a sale without the previous sanction of the Board, was illegal. It is this narrative which gives rise to the question as to whether the sale is void as it was in transgression of a statutory mandate. If it is void for such a reason, would it pave the way for the beginning and the running of the period of adverse possession by the transferee. G Would it not open the doors for applying Article 65 of the Limitation Act? Would it not then, equally, invite Section 27 of the Limitation Act to its doorstep? Resultantly, on the expiry of 12 years from 13.09.1974, would the title set up by the appellant, be extinguished? If that is so, would not the complaint filed in the year 1997, after the Act came into H 974 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A force on 01.01.1996, leading to invoking the power under Section 52 of the Act, be impermissible? 36. Section 52 of the Act, which is the fountainhead of the action by the Controller of the Waqf Board and the Collector, is a sequel to Section 51. Section 51(1), inter alia, before its substitution by Act 27 of B 2013, read as follows: “51(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the wakf deed, any gift, sale, exchange or mortgage of any immovable property which is waqf property, shall be void, unless such gift, sale, exchange or mortgage is effected with the prior sanction of the Board: C Provided that no mosque, dargah or khangah shall be gifted, sold, exchanged or mortgaged except in accordance with any law for the time being in force.” 37. We may only notice that Section 51(1)(a) as substituted by Act 27 of 2013, subject to the provisos declares a sale, gift, exchange or D mortgage or transfer of waqf property to be ab initio void. Section 52 of the Act provides that if the Board is satisfied, after making any inquiry, as may be prescribed, that any immovable property of a waqf entered as such in the Register of Waqfs maintained under Section 36, has been transferred without previous sanction of the Board in contravention of Sections 51 or 56 of the Act, it may send a requisition to the Collector of E the place within which the property is situated to obtain and deliver possession. The Collector is bound to pass an directing the person in possession to deliver the property to the Board within 30 days from the receipt of the . It is under this provision that the impugned s came to be passed. F 38. It will be noticed that the Act came into effect on 01.01.1996. Section 52 empowers the Board to send a requisition to the Collector, if property has been transferred without the previous sanction of the Board in contravention of Section 51, inter alia.
