Union of India1 (delivered on 11.08.2023), there was before us a challenge to the judgement of the Rajasthan High Court dated 25.11.2021 where it was held that for appointment of primary school teachers (i.e., teachers of Class I to Class V), the essential qualification is D.El.Ed. (i.e., Diploma in Elementary Education) and not B.Ed. (i.e., Bachelor in Education), and B.Ed. qualified candidates were held to be disqualified. 1 [2023] 11 SCR 167 : 2023 INSC 704 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 813 Navin Kumar & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. Etc. 2. Before the Rajasthan High Court, the National Council for Teachers Education (hereinafter referred to as “NCTE”) notification dated 28.06.2018, by which B.Ed. qualified candidates were held eligible was, inter alia, under challenge. In our dated 11.08.2023, we have upheld the Division Bench of Rajasthan High Court and affirmed the findings that the essential qualification for appointment as primary school teachers is Diploma in Elementary Education and not B.Ed. Consequently, the NCTE notification dated 28.06.2018 and the regulations made therein, by which B.Ed was made a qualification, were quashed and set aside.
