[M. R. SHAH, J.] “under Section 158BC”, section itself indicates the procedure that was A required to be followed by the Assessing Officer, is only in terms of the very provisions of Chapter XIV-B of the Act and therefore Section 158BC as well as 158BFA(1) are even otherwise attracted and just because the Legislature thought it fit to add or to mention Section 158BC by way of amendment through Finance Act, 2002, it would not make B any difference to the earlier provision of Section 158BD which even otherwise envisages within itself the provisions and applicability of Section 158BD and 158BFA(1). Consequently, the High Court has answered the questions of law in favour of the revenue and against the assessee and consequently allowed the said appeal. 4.4 Now so far as the levy of surcharge under Section 113 of the C Income Tax Act, the High Court has held the said question also in favour of the revenue relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Suresh N. Gupta – (2008) 297 ITR 322 (SC). 4.5 Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned D and passed by the High Court, the assessee has preferred the present appeals. 5. Shri Preetesh Kapur, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the assessee – appellant and Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG has appeared on behalf of the Revenue. E 6. Now, so far as the liability to pay the interest – applicability of Section 158BFA to persons who have not been issued notice under Section 158BC prior to the amendment in Section 158BD by Finance Act, 2002, it is vehemently submitted by Shri Kapoor, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of assessee that in the present case admittedly the F present assessee was never issued notice under Section 158BC, but was issued notice only under Section 158BD. It is submitted that in fact prior to amendment in Section 158BD by Finance Act, 2002, there was no requirement to issue notice to the “other person” under Section 158BC. It is submitted that in view of the above factual position, Section 158BFA applies only where a return “as required by notice under Clause (a) of G Section 158BC” has not been furnished within time. It is further submitted that in absence of such notice under Clause (a) of Section 158BC, the fundamental pre-requisite of the section is not fulfilled. 6.1 It is submitted that if on its plain words a section does not apply then liability under that section cannot be imposed. It is submitted H 698 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A that as consistently being held by this Hon’ble Court that for liability to be fastened upon the assessee, it must be shown that he unambiguously falls within the letter of the section. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Mathuram Agrawal Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, (1999) 8 SCC 667 (Paras 13 and 14). B 6.2 It is submitted that therefore since Section 158BFA does not cover a situation where notice has been issued under Section 158BD, no interest under that section can be recovered from the present assessee.
