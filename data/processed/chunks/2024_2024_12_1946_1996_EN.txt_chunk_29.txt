We say so on the basis of the ratio laid down in C.V. Parekh [(1970) 3 SCC 491 : 1971 SCC (Cri) 97] which is a three-Judge Bench decision. Thus, the view expressed in Sheoratan Agarwal [(1984) 4 SCC 352 : 1984 SCC (Cri) 620] does not correctly lay down the law and, accordingly, is hereby overruled. The decision in Anil Hada [(2000) 1 SCC 1 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 174] is overruled with the qualifier as stated in para 51. The decision in Modi Distillery [(1987) 3 SCC 684 : 1987 SCC (Cri) 632] has 1988 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports to be treated to be restricted to its own facts as has been explained by us hereinabove.” (Emphasis supplied) 56. As specified in paragraph 59 of the aforesaid decision, the only exception to the general rule as laid above is embodied in the doctrine of lex non cogit ad impossibilia which means that the law doesn’t compel the impossible. Thus, it is only in those cases where the impleadment of the company is not possible due to some legal impediment that this general rule can be exempted. In the facts on hand, it cannot be said that there was any legal difficulty in impleading Shilabati Hospital Pvt. Ltd. as an accused in the complaint case filed by the complainant. Thus, even the benefit of the exception cannot be extended to the complainant in the present case. 57. In Himanshu v. B. Shivamurthy (supra), the Court was examining the legality and validity of the quashing a complaint passed by the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 of the CrPC in a case where the Director of the company was arraigned as the sole accused for the dishonour of a cheque drawn upon the bank account held in the name of the company. Reiterating the principles laid down in Aneeta Hada (supra), this Court upheld the decision of the High Court in quashing the complaint case. 58. In yet another decision of this Court in Mainuddin Abdul Sattar Shaikh v. Vijay D. Salvi reported in (2015) 9 SCC 622, the facts interestingly were virtually opposite to the facts of the case on hand. In the said case, the accused, who was the Managing Director of a company had issued a cheque drawn on his personal account in discharge of the liability of the company. The cheque later came to be dishonoured and a private complaint was lodged against the accused under Section 138 of the NI Act. Both the trial court and the High Court acquitted the accused on the ground that the company was not made a party to the proceedings. However, this Court set aside the of acquittal and held the accused liable for the offence under Section 138. It was observed by this Court that as the cheque was drawn by the accused on an account maintained by him, the Company or any of its directors could not be made liable for the offence, even if the cheque was issued by the accused towards the discharge of the debt of the company.
