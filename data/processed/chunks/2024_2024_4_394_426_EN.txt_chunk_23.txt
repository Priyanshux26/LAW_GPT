Therefore, it is clear that Nuney Tayang tied up the improper acceptance of Karikho Kri’s nomination, relatable to Section 100(1)(d)(i) of the Act of 1951, with the non-compliance relatable to Section 100(1)(d)(iv) thereof and he did not sufficiently plead or prove a specific breach or how it materially affected the result of the election, in so far as it concerned the returned candidate, Karikho Kri. It was not open to Nuney Tayang to link up separate issues and fail to plead in detail and adduce sufficient evidence in relation to the non-compliance that would attract Section 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act of 1951. The finding of the High Court in that regard is equally bereft of rhyme and reason and cannot be sustained. 49. As regards the failure on the part of Karikho Kri to disclose the dues of municipal/property taxes payable by him and his wife, the same cannot be held to be a non-disclosure at all, inasmuch as he did disclose the particulars of such dues in one part of his Affidavit but did not do so in another part. In any event, as Mr. Arunabh Chowdhury, learned senior counsel, fairly stated that he would not be pressing this ground, we need not labour further upon this point. 50. On the above analysis, we hold that the High Court was in error in concluding that sufficient grounds were made out under Sections 100(1)(b), 100(1)(d)(i) and 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act of 1951 to invalidate the election of Karikho Kri and, further, in holding that non-disclosure of the three vehicles, that still remained registered in the names of his wife and son as on the date of filing of his nomination, amounted to a ‘corrupt practice’ under Section 123(2) of the Act of 1951. In consequence, we find no necessity to independently deal with Civil Appeal No. 4716 of 2023 filed by Nuney Tayang, in the context of denial of relief to him by the High Court, or the issues raised by Dr. Mohesh Chai in the replies filed by him. 51. In the result, Civil Appeal No. 4615 of 2023 filed by Karikho Kri is allowed, setting aside the and dated 17.07.2023 passed by the Itanagar Bench of the High Court of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh in Election Petition No.01(AP) of 2019. In consequence, the election of Karikho Kri as the returned 426 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports candidate from 44 Tezu (ST) Assembly Constituency of the State of Arunachal Pradesh is upheld. As a corollary, Civil Appeal No. 4716 of 2023, filed by Nuney Tayang, shall stand dismissed. Pending applications in both the appeals, if any, shall also stand disposed of. This decision shall be intimated to the Election Commission of India and to the Chairman of the Legislative Assembly of the State of Arunachal Pradesh forthwith, as required by Section 116C(2) of the Act of 1951. An authenticated copy of this shall be sent to the Election Commission of India forthwith. Parties shall bear their own costs.
