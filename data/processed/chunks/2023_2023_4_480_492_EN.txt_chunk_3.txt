As the scope of this appeal has been restricted to the sentence F imposed upon the appellant, we need not dilate on or deal with the issues raised vis-à-vis the merits of his conviction for the offences under Sections 376, 377 and 506 IPC. 6. Section 376(2) IPC, prior to its amendment with retrospective effect from 03.02.2013 by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, G consisted of clauses (a) to (g). Section 376(2)(f), as it stood then, provided that whoever commits rape on a woman when she is under 12 years of age shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 10 years but which may be for life and shall also be liable to fine. Section 377 IPC states that whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the of nature with any man, woman or animal H RAVINDER SINGH v. THE STATE GOVT. OF NCT OF DELHI 485 [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of A either description for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine. It was in exercise of power under Sections 376(2)(f) and 377 IPC that the learned Additional Sessions Judge sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment, as the victim was merely 9 years of age and was also subjected to carnal intercourse against the of nature. B He, however, added the riderthat the appellant should not be given clemency by the State until he spent at least 20 years in jail. In effect, the appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment of a minimum term of 20 years. 7. Imprisonment for life, in terms of Section 53 IPC read with C Section 45 IPC, means imprisonment for the rest of the life of the prisoner, subject to the right to claim remission, etc., as provided under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution and under Section 432 Cr.P.C. In Gopal Vinayak Godse Vs. State of Maharashtra1, this Court held that a sentence of imprisonment for life must, prima facie, be treated as imprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted D person’s natural life.
