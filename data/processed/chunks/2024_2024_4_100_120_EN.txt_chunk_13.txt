The stand taken was that to facilitate its employees for having ease of access to Government Departments, the appellant like many other private organisations, tactfully gave fanciful and impressive designations like “Regional Business Head”, “Team Leader”, etc. without any real power or authority. It was submitted that subsequently, the appellant did not issue any further Memo or Letter designating him as “Regional Business Head” or “Team Leader”. He reiterated that he was not writing any appraisals of any employee and was also not an “Assessing Manager”. The respondent also tried to indicate discrepancies in the stand of the appellant before different fora. 17. The respondent, in support of his contentions above, has placed reliance upon the following pronouncements: Devinder Singh v Municipal Counicl, Sanaur, (2011) 6 SCC 584; Suo-Motu Contempt Petition (Civil) No.3 of 2021 [2022 SCC OnLine SC 858]; Shankarbhai Nathalal Prajapati v Maize Products, 2002 SCC OnLine Guj 143; Suzuki Parasrampuria Suitings Private Limited v Official Liquidator of Mahendra Petrochemicals Limited (in Liquidation), (2018) 10 SCC 707; Muthu Karuppan, Commissioner of Police, Chennai v Parithi Ilamvazhuthi, (2011) 5 SCC 496; K D Sharma v Steel Authority of India Limited, (2008) 12 SCC 481; Tularam Manikrao Hadge v 114 [2024] 4 S.C.R.

Bombay, (1985) 3 SCC 371. ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION: 18. Having carefully considered the facts and circumstances and submissions of the parties, the Court finds that the Impugned as also the passed by the learned Single Judge cannot be sustained. The moot issue is whether the respondent would or would not come within the definitional stipulation of a “workman” as laid out under Section 2(s), ID Act. The same reads as under: “2(s) “workman” means any person (including an apprentice) employed in any industry to do any manual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational, clerical or supervisory work for hire or reward, whether the terms of employment be express or implied, and for the purposes of any proceeding under this Act in relation to an industrial dispute, includes any such person who has been dismissed, discharged or retrenched in connection with, or as a consequence of, that dispute, or whose dismissal, discharge or retrenchment has led to that dispute, but does not include any such person— (i) who is subject to the Air Force Act, 1950 (45 of 1950), or the Army Act, 1950 (46 of 1950), or the Navy Act, 1957 (62 of 1957); or (ii) who is employed in the police service or as an officer or other employee of a prison; or (iii) who is employed mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity; or [2024] 4 S.C.R.
