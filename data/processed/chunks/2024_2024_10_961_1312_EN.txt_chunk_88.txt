Since other States, in general, were not facing similar issues, the differentiation in classes was reasonable. Hence, even if some States like West Bengal were placed similarly to Assam, that in and of itself would not lead to holding Section 6A unconstitutional. Accepting the Petitioners’ contention and striking down Section 6A on the grounds of non-inclusion only of West Bengal would amount to allowing an under-inclusivity challenge in disguise, which, as discussed before, is not generally permitted by this Court. 204. Instead of comparing bline cases such as West Bengal with Assam, the comparison ought to be between Assam and an average constituent of the other class, i.e. the rest of India. As analysed in previous sections, Assam and the rest of India are distinguishable 153 Basheer, supra note 141. 1088 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports on the basis of the unique political situation created in Assam by the influx of immigrants. The classification under Section 6A, therefore, is not violative of Article 14 simply because it is applicable to the State of Assam alone. 205. On the basis of the aforesaid reasoning, it is held that Section 6A is not ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India. vi. Manifest arbitrariness 206. Citing Shayara Bano v. Union of India,154 the Petitioners argued that a provision can be struck down as unconstitutional if it is manifestly arbitrary. To prove that Section 6A is manifestly arbitrary, the Petitioners contended that: (a) Section 6A is against the overarching principles of democracy, federalism and the rule of law and is liable to be struck down on the grounds of manifest arbitrariness. (b) The cut-off dates in Section 6A, namely 01.01.1966 and 25.03.1971, have no rationale and have been set arbitrarily. (c) There is no machinery for evaluating, assessing and determining the grant of citizenship under Section 6A(2), thus allowing anyone above the age of 57 years in Assam to claim citizenship without claiming ancestry or provenance. 207. The Petitioners also contended that the expression ‘ordinarily resident’ is vague as it does not prescribe any yardstick for the number of days required to qualify the same. In this light, the Petitioners have cited this Court’s decision in Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia v. Union of India155 to contend that when key concepts in a provision are vague, the same ought to be struck down. 208. Per contra, the Respondents contended that the challenge to Section 6A under Article 14 on the grounds of being ‘manifestly arbitrary’ is untenable as there is an underlying rationale for the cut-off dates. It was submitted that the validity of 01.01.1966 as the cut-off date is severable from the validity of 25.03.1971. Hence, even if it is held to be arbitrary, Section 6A as a whole cannot be held to be 154 Shayara Bano v. Union of India (2017) 9 SCC 1 155 Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia v. Union of India (1969) 2 SCC 166 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1089 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 unconstitutional.
