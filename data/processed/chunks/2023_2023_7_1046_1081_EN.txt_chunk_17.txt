Therefore, changes in the statute will automatically be reflected in the previous law. 44. It was urged that “Pan Masala containing tobacco” and “chewing tobacco” are not identical. They undoubtedly were included G under the same heading. However, they were not one commodity. It was argued that the amendment with effect from 2001 that “chewing tobacco” does not include, and never included “Pan Masala containing 26 [1976] 1 SCR 6: (1975) 2 SCC 377 27 [2002] Supp (2) SCR 636: (2002) 7 SCC 657 28 [1998] 1 SCR 254: (1998) 2 SCC 467 H 1070 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A tobacco” and but for the inclusion of “Pan Masala containing tobacco” in Chapter 24 and sub-heading 2404.49 with effect from 2001, it would have been goods covered by Heading 21.06. The General Rules for Interpretation (in the CEA) was relied on, to say that “Pan Masala containing tobacco” is a specific description of the goods. Further, that tobacco is an ingredient in the article, is not relevant, because the B description (of ‘Pan Masala’ in Heading 21.06) describes the goods specifically. That classification would prevail. It is, argued that Rule 3(b) is irrelevant. By its description, the goods are ‘Pan Masala’ containing tobacco. Analysis and reasoning C 45. As is evident, in all the three cases, emanating from s of the Delhi, Madras and Allahabad High Courts, the local enactments contain a similar scheme or pattern, which is (a) a provision that imposes levy of sales or trade tax; (b) a provision which empowers fixation of different rates for different goods, or classes of goods and (c) a provision D or provisions which exempt goods, enumerated in a Schedule, for that purpose (like in the case of Delhi - in the Third Schedule, read with Section 7 of the DST Act) or through a general notification. In all cases, the arguments by the dealers were more or less identical, which is reliance on Kothari Products Ltd. (supra); that when specific goods are E exempted, they cannot be taxed by inclusion in the notification relating to rate of taxation, notwithstanding that the authority to exempt, and the authority to tax or increase rates, resides with the state or the same authority. The dealer/appellants also relied on the provisions of the CET Act, especially Chapter 24, to contend that pan masala or gutkha, were tobacco, and therefore, exempt. All these arguments were rejected by F the High Courts. The Delhi High Court in the case of Shanti Fragrances, was noticed by the later s of the same High Court, as well as other High Courts. 46. At the relevant time, ‘Pan Masala’ was described as a preparation containing betel nuts and any one or more other ingredients G such as lime, katha, katechu, cardamom, copra, menthol and tobacco. This is the definition of Pan Masala under the CET Act which continued till 1995. Heading 21.06 covered ‘Pan Masala’ containing “lime, katha, katechu, cardamom, copra, menthol and tobacco” or any one or more of these ingredients.
