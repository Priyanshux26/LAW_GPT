ITS 65 CONSTITUTED ATTORNEY v. THE MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF GREATER MUMBAI [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] (x) that at Serial No.17 of the said printed form, the owners were A called upon to inform whether the reservation is proposed to be built as per the plans approved by the concerned authority as per clause 6; (xi) that the answer of appellant No.1 to the question at serial No.17 was that the question does not arise as the reservation was for “Recreation Ground”; B (xii) that before claiming additional TDR in terms of clause 6, neither appellant No.1 nor appellant No.2 filled in the printed Form; (xiii) that under clause 6, the amenity has to be developed as per the stipulations prescribed by the Commissioner or the appropriate C authority, but in this case, these authorities did not prescribe any stipulations, since the appellants did not submit any printed Form for additional TDR; (xiv) that appellant No.2 is not the owner or lessee of the land and hence when appellant No.2 made a request for the development/ maintenance of the land, the request was granted on condition that D appellant No.2 will not claim any TDR; and (xv) that in any case the appellants should be deemed to have abandoned their claim for additional TDR, in view of the fact that they came up with the writ petition only in the year 2010 challenging the rejection of the request for additional TDR made in the year 1998 and E that, therefore, the writ petition deserves to be dismissed. 5.Assailing the impugned of the High Court, it is contended by Shri P. Chidambaram, learned senior counsel: (i) that TDR/Additional TDR, constitute compensation in kind for F the acquisition of the land and the development of the amenity and hence the denial of the same will be an infringement of the right to property guaranteed under Article 300A of the Constitution; (ii) that there is no dispute that the appellants developed the “Recreation Ground,” in terms of the plan approved by the G Superintendent of Gardens; (iii) that the High Court overlooked the approval granted by the Municipal Commissioner which was available on record and hence the finding that the appropriate authority did not grant approval is factually incorrect; H 66 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A (iv) that in terms of Regulation 6, the amenity is required to be developed “on the surrendered plot” and the vesting in favour of the Corporation takes place only after the development of the amenity in terms of Section 126(1)(b); (v) that the stand taken by the Corporation before the High Court B that the appellant did not develop the amenity, was an afterthought; (vi) that the request for Additional TDR made by the appellants on 17.04.1998 was rejected by the Corporation by a communication dated 27.11.1998, not on the ground that the appellants did not develop the amenity, but on the sole ground that the prevailing policy did not C permit the grant of additional TDR; (vii) that the inference drawn by the High Court that there was abandonment of right by the appellant, on account of the delay in approaching the High Court, was totally perverse: (viii) that the High Court failed to appreciate that the delay was D due to the necessity for the appellant to await the outcome of their challenge to the “prevailing policy” and that, therefore, the impugned is liable to be set aside.
