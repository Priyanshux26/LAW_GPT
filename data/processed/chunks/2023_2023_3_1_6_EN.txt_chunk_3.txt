Reliance is placed upon the recent STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH & ORS. v. RAJIV AND ANR. 5 [M. R. SHAH, J.] decision of this Court in the case of Sukh Dutt Ratra and Anr. Vs. A State of Himachal Pradesh and Ors., (2022) 7 SCC 505. 4.5 Relying upon the aforesaid decision, it is further submitted that as observed and held by this Court in the said decision in absence of written consent to voluntarily give up their land, the land owners are entitled to the compensation in terms of law. B 5. Having heard learned counsel appearing for the respective parties and in the facts and circumstances of the case and when the writ petition and the claim of the original writ petitioners to claim the compensation for the land used for construction of the road has been opposed by the State solely on the ground of delay and laches, we are of C the opinion that on the certain conditions which shall be considered herein below the original writ petitioners – owners of the land used by the State for construction of the road shall be entitled to the compensation for their lands which have been used by the State without acquisition under the Act, 1894. D 5.1 At this stage, it is required to be noted that in the present case as such initially the Notification under Section 4 was issued for acquisition of the land at Village Tikkari on 17.05.1996. However thereafter the notification so issued under Section 4 of the Act, 1894 was permitted to lapse. Therefore, 17.05.1996 can be directed to be treated as a deemed E acquisition on that day and the original landowners may be awarded the compensation considering the market price as on 17.05.1996, however with all other statutory benefits excluding the interest from 17.05.1996 till the writ petition was filed before the High Court. If the aforesaid is passed in exercise of this Court’s extra ordinary jurisdiction under Articles 136 & 142 of the Constitution, the same can be said to be F just and proper and doing the complete justice between the parties. 6. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, present appeal stands disposed of by directing that 17.05.1996 be treated as the deemed date of acquisition under Section 4 of the Act, 1894 and the original owners/writ petitioners shall be entitled to the compensation G considering the market price of the land in question used by the State for construction of the road as on 17.05.1996. However, considering the fact that there was a huge delay of 20 years in filing the writ petition before the High Court, we direct that though the original writ petitioners shall be entitled to all the statutory benefits which may be available under the Act, 1894 from 17.05.1996, however they shall not be entitled to any H 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A interest under the Act, 1894 from 17.05.1996 to the date of filing of the writ petition.
