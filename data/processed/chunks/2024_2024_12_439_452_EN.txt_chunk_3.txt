The Court, while dismissing the revision petition, observed that at the stage of charge framing, the Court’s role is preliminary and limited to determining whether a prima facie case exists. The test applied is whether the materials presented by the prosecution, taken at its face value, disclose ingredients of the alleged offence. The Court is not required to evaluate the probative value of the evidence or assess its sufficiency for conviction. Instead, it only has to consider whether there is a strong suspicion that the accused might have committed the offence. This suspicion must be based on credible material and not on arbitrary conclusions. In the present case, witness statements revealed that the deceased had faced consistent physical and mental harassment by the accused. The harassment included selling the deceased’s gold ornaments, which was her streedhan, and torturing her when she demanded their return. Witnesses also indicated that the harassment intensified before her suicide, particularly during a recent family event, and directly contributed to her decision to end her life. These statements provided sufficient material to establish strong suspicion against the accused. The Court further noted that the appellants failed to present any material demonstrating that the allegations were patently absurd or inherently improbable. As such, the High Court upheld the decision of the Sessions Court to frame charges under Sections 306 2 CrPC 444 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and 498A of the IPC. The revision petition was dismissed, with the High Court finding it devoid of merit and an attempt to delay the trial. 6. Aggrieved by this , the appellants are before us on several grounds, inter alia, that the allegations against them are completely baseless and they have been roped in on concocted facts and there is nothing on record to show how the appellants were even remotely involved in abetting the suicide of the deceased. Further, the appellants also claimed that allegations made against them in the FIR as well as statements brought on the record are vague and general, and do not constitute an offence either under section 306 or section 498A, IPC. And thus, there is no prima facie case against them to condemn them to face trial as the key ingredient of mens rea required to make out a case under section 306, IPC is absolutely lacking. That apart, from the alleged selling of the ornaments there was no bone of contention between the deceased and the appellants. Having been together with appellant no. l for a duration of almost twelve years there has been no other complaint filed against any of the appellants under section 498A, IPC nor is the claim made by the informant that there was a constant demand for dowry or that the appellant kept the deceased badly or treated her badly. The only instance, as alleged in the FIR, of harassment was allegedly met out to the deceased when she inquired about getting back the jewellery that was allegedly sold off by appellant no.1 and his family members which, admittedly, as per the of the Trial Court, occurred a year prior to death of the deceased.
