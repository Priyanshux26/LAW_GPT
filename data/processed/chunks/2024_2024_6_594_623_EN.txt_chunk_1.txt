187 allotted to them under the second varied Town Planning Scheme, was of lesser area, accepted the same without any protest and without agitating a right to a larger area in the light of the initial allotment of Plot No.463, and their conduct in depositing ₹24,350/- thereafter, implying receipt of the compensation amount for the shortfall area of 974 sq. mts. @ 25/- per sq. mt., foreclosed their right, if any, to either challenge the allotment of a plot of lesser area or to seek more compensation – Further, upon the preparation or variation of a Town Planning Scheme, the rights in the earlier plots of land would stand extinguished – Thus, such rights, if any, which became extinct cannot be the basis for a later cause of action – Also, the quantification of compensation @ 25/- per sq. mt. for the shortfall area of 974 sq. mts., which is relatable to the power of the Town Planning Officer u/s.52(3)(x), was a decision which was amenable to appellate review u/s.54 however, admittedly the plaintiffs did not avail such remedy – Plaintiffs’ claim for damages/compensation was also not supported by material evidence – Further, as there was never any guarantee that a plot owner who surrendered his land pursuant to a Town Planning Scheme would be allotted any land after reconstitution of the plots, the plaintiffs cannot assert 596 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports any vested right in that regard – High Court justified in allowing the first appeal filed by the Corporation and non-suiting the plaintiffs in entirety – Impugned not interfered with. [Paras 29-31, 34, 35, 39, 41 and 42] Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976 – ss.70, 71 – Plaintiffs argued that variation of the Town Planning Scheme as permitted u/ss.70 and 71 must be read together: Held: No merit in this submission – Section 70 deals with the power to vary a Town Planning Scheme on the ground of error, irregularity or informality while Section 71 is general in nature and states that, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 70, a Town Planning Scheme may at any time be varied by a subsequent scheme made, published and sanctioned in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1976 – The very fact that Section 71 begins with a non-obstante clause referring to Section 70, manifests that the power thereunder is not fettered in any manner, unlike the power under Section 70 which can only be exercised on the grounds of error, irregularity or informality – Further, Section 71 postulates that the variation of the Town Planning Scheme is to be made, published and sanctioned in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1976, which would mean that the entire exercise would be undertaken afresh upon such variation, including reconstitution of the plots under Section 45 – Therefore, further reduction of a plot notified in the original Town Planning Scheme is implicit in the general power of variation vesting in the authority under Section 71 of the Act of 1976.
