7.5 crores with the Executing Court on 22.10.2010. 2.3 The Trial Court dismissed the objections filed under Section 48 by dated 02.04.2011. The appellants filed [2024] 8 S.C.R. 297 DLF Ltd. (Formerly Known as DLF Universal Ltd) and Anr. v. Koncar Generators and Motors Ltd. a revision, which the High Court admitted by dated 03.06.2011. By this , the High Court also stayed the operation of the Trial Court dismissing objections, subject to the appellants depositing a further amount of Rs. 50 lakhs, in addition to Rs. 7.5 crores, with the Executing Court. The Court directed that the amount shall be disbursed to the successful party on the final adjudication of this lis. It also rejected the respondent’s prayer for deposit of the amount in euros. Pursuant to this , the appellants deposited Rs. 50 lakhs on 15.07.2011. Subsequently, the revision came to be dismissed by the High Court on 01.07.2014, by which the award attained finality as this was not challenged any further. 2.4 In the execution proceedings, the Trial Court by dated 24.08.2016 permitted the respondent to withdraw the entire deposit of Rs. 8 crores as per the direction of the High Court.

The Trial Court accepted the calculation as submitted by the respondent. 2.6 The appellants filed a revision petition against this , which was dismissed by the High Court by dated 26.02.2018,5 which is impugned herein. The High Court rejected the appellant’s reliance on this Court’s decision in Forasol (supra) to submit that the date of decree shall be deemed as the relevant date for conversion and since the award dated 12.05.2004 is a deemed decree under the Act, the exchange rate as on the date of the award should be applied. The Court reasoned that this Court’s in Forasol (supra) was passed under the Arbitration Act, 1940 and hence, does not apply in the present case. Instead, the High Court referred to the Delhi High Court’s 5 In CR No. 1827 of 2017 (O&M), Punjab and Haryana High Court (hereinafter “impugned ”). 298 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports decision in Progetto Grano S.P.A. v. Shri Lal Mahal Limited,6 against which this Court dismissed the SLP,7 where it was held that the relevant date for conversion is when the objections filed under Section 48 are finally decided.
