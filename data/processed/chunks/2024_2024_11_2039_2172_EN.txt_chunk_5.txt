[Paras 163-165] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Deficiencies/ Shortcomings – Suggestions – Functioning of the NCLTs and NCLAT – The Guidelines for Committee of Creditors (CoC) issued by the IBBI on 06.08.2024, enumerated – Suggestions made to CoC – Role, duty and responsibility of Successful Resolution Applicant; lenders and also that of creditors: Held: 1. The Guidelines for Committee of Creditors issued by the IBBI may go a long way in streamlining the functions of the CoC – Adding to the aforesaid guidelines, it is suggested that the CoC exercise their commercial wisdom and approve/reject the Resolution Plans placed before them exhibiting fairness and with good reasons – Such a reasoned decision making on their part will only serve to further enable the other key players like the Adjudicating Authorities to understand the rationale behind their decision and to uphold the correctness of the same – Furthermore, it is also suggested that the Central Government or the IBBI explore the possibilities of better enforcement of the standards and practices enumerated in the guidelines through an independent mechanism under the auspices of an oversight committee instead of making them self-regulatory. [Para 172] 2.1 Once a resolution plan is approved under the IBC, 2016, the Successful Resolution Applicant undertakes a profound responsibility to implement the plan in both letter and spirit – This obligation is not merely an empty formality but an enduring commitment to 2046 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports restore the corporate debtor to viability and ensure a meaningful turnaround – The role of a Successful Resolution Applicant is far more than a transactional duty towards the creditors or stakeholders; it embodies a pivotal responsibility to the distressed entity itself, which must be approached with utmost dedication and an earnest sense of duty – Regardless of the challenges that may arise, the Successful Resolution Applicant cannot treat its obligations as optional or conditional, nor can it abdicate its responsibility in the face of unforeseen obstacles – Its efforts must reflect a determination to implement the plan fully and to rejuvenate the debtor company, as this is integral to the success of the IBC framework and the spirit of economic revival it seeks to foster – The approach, therefore, must not be frugal or narrowly profit-driven, limited to viewing the transaction through a purely commercial lens – Instead, it must recognize that rescuing a distressed company is a responsibility of significant social and economic value, demanding a holistic and responsible strategy. [Para 173] 2.2 In this collaborative effort, the duty to implement the plan does not fall on the Successful Resolution Applicant alone; lenders and creditors are equally obligated to support the process by offering constructive and continuous cooperation – They must not impede the implementation process through unnecessary demands beyond the pale of the resolution plan or with delays in implementation plan but rather should facilitate the Successful Resolution Applicant’s efforts to revive the corporate debtor – Given their vested interest in the corporate debtor’s successful revival, lenders have a fundamental duty to act in good faith and with transparency, recognizing that their cooperative stance is essential for overcoming the inevitable challenges of the resolution process – The lender's role is not merely passive; it requires active support that aligns with the ultimate goal of the IBC, 2016- to provide a fair and equitable resolution that maximizes asset value while enabling the debtor’s recovery – Therefore, the lenders must balance their financial interests with the broader objective of rehabilitation – They should not take an obstructive approach or seek to leverage the resolution process solely for individual benefit, as such actions would risk destabilizing the corporate debtor’s recovery trajectory – Instead, they must be prepared to collaborate fully, sharing the responsibility to make the resolution process work in practice.
