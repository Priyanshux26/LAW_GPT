9. However, the finding of the Inquiry Officer that the appellant’s statement in his application dated 05.06.2003 that he met the Central Nazir number of times between 24.08.2001 to 15.01.2003 1 [1986] 2 SCR 957 : AIR 1986 SC 995 2 [2014] 6 SCR 138 : AIR 2014 SC 2966 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 353 Chatrapal v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. is not reflected in appellant’s representation. In fact, the application dated 05.06.2003 was addressed to the Janapad Nyaayaadeesh and the relevant statement is that the applicant met the addressee i.e. Janapad Nyaayaadeesh number of times between 24.08.2001 to 15.01.2003. There is no statement that he met the Central Nazir during this period. In respect of meeting the Central Nazir, his statement is that he met him on 04.06.2003. Thus, the finding of making false statement and allegation in his representation dated 05.06.2003 is not borne out from the record. Since, this finding is the fulcrum of the reasoning to hold that charge no. 1 is proved, in our considered view, this finding in the inquiry report is perverse. 10. Insofar as the allegation that the appellant made false allegations of discrimination on caste basis, it is significant to notice that the appellant himself has not made any such allegation in his letter dated 05.06.2003. In the said letter, he has stated that it was the Central Nazir who told him that the District Judge is saying that the appellant is a Harijan employee, and he hates the people of such community. Thus, it is clear that the appellant himself has not made any such allegation against the District Judge but it was the Central Nazir who made that statement. The Inquiry Officer had referred to the report of the Central Nazir dated 20.06.2003 which is available on record. Regarding the above statement, the Central Nazir has not denied specifically. He has only stated that the charges levelled by the appellant are false and baseless. The Central Nazir has neither made any specific denial that he has not demanded illegal gratification of Rs. 3,000/- from the appellant. Even though, in his letter dated 05.06.2003, the appellant has made specific allegation to this effect against the Central Nazir. 11. The charge no. 2 against the appellant concerns directly sending the representations to the High Court and Hon’ble Chief Minister/ Minister without routing the same through proper channel. In this regard, it is suffice to observe that Class-IV employee, when in financial hardship, may represent directly to the superior but that by itself cannot amount to major misconduct for which punishment of termination from service should be imposed. Even otherwise, the appellant has cited examples of other employees of the District Court, Bareilly who have sent representations directly to the superiors, but no action has been taken against them. 354 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 12. It is trite law that ordinarily the findings recorded by the Inquiry Officer should not be interfered by the appellate authority or by the writ court.
