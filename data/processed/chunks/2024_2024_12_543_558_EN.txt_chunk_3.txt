Proceedings under Section 26 of the HMA are independent of the main divorce proceedings, and relief under this section can be granted for a period beyond the dismissal of the main divorce petition. The Court therein observed that the appellant had adopted delaying tactics, which prevented the timely resolution of the respondent’s enhancement application. The appellant had been evasive in disclosing his actual income and assets, concealing his true financial status, including his movable and immovable properties. Therefore, he failed to discharge his moral and legal obligations to provide reasonable and just maintenance to his wife and son, commensurate with their social and economic standing. 8. The Family Court held that the respondent and her son are entitled to enhanced maintenance considering the increased expenditures for a growing child and the respondent’s requirements aligned with her social status. Accordingly, the Family Court directed the appellant to pay the following amounts: 548 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports i. ₹1,15,000/- (Rupees one lakh fifteen thousand only) per month as pendente lite maintenance to the wife and the son from 28.02.2009 to 14.07.2016, when the divorce petition was withdrawn. ii. ₹35,000/- (Rupees thirty five thousand only) per month to the son from 15.07.2016, until he attains the age of 26 years or becomes financially independent, whichever is earlier. This amount shall be subject to a 10% increase every two years starting 28.05.2019. iii. Litigation costs of ₹2,00,000/- (Rupees two lakhs only). 9. Both the parties challenged the above of the Family Court vide two separate appeals before the High Court. It is the passed in these appeals by the High Court, which is challenged before us by the appellant. 10. The High Court considered whether the Family Court loses its jurisdiction to decide pending applications under Sections 24 and 26 of the HMA, upon withdrawal of the main divorce petition. The appellant argued that the Family Court becomes functus officio upon such withdrawal, and therefore, proceedings for interim maintenance and child-related relief under Sections 24 and 26 of the HMA, respectively, could not be adjudicated. This contention was based on the assumption that the statutory jurisdiction under Sections 24 and 26 of the HMA is ancillary to the divorce proceedings and cannot survive withdrawal of the main case. The High Court rejected this argument, holding that both provisions are independent in nature and continue to operate despite the withdrawal of the divorce petition. The High Court observed that the legislature’s intent behind Section 24 of the HMA is to ensure that a financially dependent spouse is not left without resources during the pendency of matrimonial disputes, and this obligation cannot be unilaterally nullified by withdrawal of the petition. It emphasized that allowing withdrawal of the main petition to terminate Section 24 of the HMA proceedings would render the dependent spouse financially vulnerable and create a procedural loophole for evasion of legal obligations. The High Court concluded that interim maintenance proceedings have an independent existence and are not strictly ancillary to the main proceedings.
