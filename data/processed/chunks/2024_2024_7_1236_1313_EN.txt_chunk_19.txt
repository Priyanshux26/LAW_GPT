Subsequently, in Shamim Bano v. Asraf Khan (2014) 12 SCC 636, this Court had to consider the maintainability of a petition under Section 125 of CrPC 1973 vis-à-vis a situation where a petition under Section 3 of the 1986 Act has been subsequently moved. Holding that an election under Section 5 of the 1986 Act was not imperative, since both the petitions were moved before a Magistrate, it clarified that even for the purpose of adjudicating a petition under the personal law, specifically in regard to maintenance for a divorced Muslim woman, the parameters of Section 125 of CrPC 1973 would be applicable. 21. It is imperative to acknowledge that the enactment of the Family Courts Act, 1984 (hereinafter referred to as “FCA 1984”) had excluded the jurisdiction of a Magistrate under Chapter IX of CrPC 1973, of which Section 125 is a part, wherein a Family Court had been established for the concerned area or jurisdiction. After the enactment of FCA 1984, a situation arose where a divorced Muslim woman moved a Family Court under Section 125 of CrPC 1973, and a similar circumstance [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1263 Mohd. Abdul Samad v. The State of Telangana & Anr. was dealt in Shamima Farooqui v. Shahid Khan (2015) 5 SCC 705 in light of the question of law at hand. Herein, while relying on the earlier mentioned s of this Court, it observed that the concerned Family Court had rightly, and without a shadow of a doubt, held that Section 125 of CrPC 1973 would be applicable. The relevant paragraph number 09 is reproduced below: “9. First of all, we intend to deal with the applicability of Section 125 CrPC to a Muslim woman who has been divorced. In Shamim Bano v. Asraf Khan [(2014) 12 SCC 636 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 145 : (2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 162], this Court after referring to the Constitution Bench decisions in Danial Latifi v. Union of India [(2001) 7 SCC 740 : (2007) 3 SCC (Cri) 266] and Khatoon Nisa v. State of U.P. [Khatoon Nisa v. State of U.P. (2014) 12 SCC 646 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 155 : (2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 170] had opined as follows : (Shamim Bano case [(2014) 12 SCC 636 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 145 : (2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 162], SCC p. 644, paras 13-14) '13. The aforesaid principle clearly lays down that even after an application has been filed under the provisions of the Act, the Magistrate under the Act has the power to grant maintenance in favour of a divorced Muslim woman and the parameters and the considerations are the same as stipulated in Section 125 of the Code. We may note that while taking note of the factual score to the effect that the plea of divorce was not accepted by the Magistrate which was upheld by the High Court, the Constitution Bench [(2001) 7 SCC 740 : (2007) 3 SCC (Cri) 266] opined that as the Magistrate could exercise power under Section 125 of the Code for grant of maintenance in favour of a divorced Muslim woman under the Act, the did not warrant any interference.
