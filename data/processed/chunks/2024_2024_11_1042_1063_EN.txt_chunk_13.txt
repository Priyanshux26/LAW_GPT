The letter is not only based on a mis-appreciation of the statutory scheme underlying Section 20 of the Act of 1954 but is fundamentally at odds with the constitutional status of judges of the High Court as a homogenous class. 36. The letter dated 30 December 2022 shall accordingly stand quashed and set aside. In consequence, we allow the petitions by directing that a General Provident Fund account shall be opened with effect from the date of appointment of every one of the petitioners into which contributions shall be credited at par with all other judges of the High Court irrespective of the source from which they were drawn. 37. The amounts which are lying to the credit of the petitioners in the New Pension Scheme shall be returned to them within a period of four weeks from the date of this . 38.
