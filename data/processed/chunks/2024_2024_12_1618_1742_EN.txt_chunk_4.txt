[Paras 152, 153] Doctrines / Principles – Doctrine of lis pendens – Doctrine of Pari Delicto – Property situated in Maharashtra – Applicability of lis pendens in absence of any registration as required under 1624 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the State Amendment to s.52 of TPA – Even in absence of a registered notice of pendency in terms of amended s.52 of TPA the said provision will not be rendered ipso-facto inapplicable – Even otherwise, in peculiar facts of the present case, non- registration of notice of pendency not fatal to application of the doctrine of lis pendens – Transfer of Property Act, 1882 – s.52 (as amended by State of Maharashtra) – Bombay Amendment Act, 1939: Held: 1.1. The amended Section 52 sub-section (1) of the TPA casts upon a party who is claiming any right to a property which is a subject-matter of any pending suit or proceeding an additional duty to register a notice of pendency in respect of such property so as to caution and put to notice any third-party who might otherwise be unaware of such proceeding or litigation despite the best of due diligence either due to inadvertence or deliberate misleading by one of the parties to the lis and as result might be genuinely considering to purchase or acquire any right in the subject-matter proceeding – The requirement of registration of notice of pendency is to prevent any undue or unwarranted hardship to such third-parties who even after a reasonable due diligence have bona-fidely purchased the property believing it to be free from the encumbrances of any pending proceeding only to later face the adverse consequence of losing their rights by a mechanical application of lis pendens. [Para 171] 1.2. This additional requirement of registration of notice of pendency is for the benefit of the party claiming any right in such subject- matter property and also for the benefit of any third-party interested in such subject-matter property by enabling the former to claim the benefit of lis pendens as an absolute right after having duly taken steps towards ensuring that the public is well-aware of the impeding litigation in respect of such property by registering a notice of pendency and to enable the latter to ascertain the veracity of title of such property by exercise of its due diligence – Although, the said provision is for the benefit of the third-party, yet such subsequent purchasers cannot as a matter of absolute right claim any title to such property solely on the ground of want of any notice of pendency being registered – To hold otherwise would undermine the object and purpose of the doctrine of lis pendens which is based on the principle of equity, good conscience, and public policy and discourage any thwarting or frustration of rights of the parties so litigating by unscrupulous and unanticipated transactions. [Para 172] [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1625 Celir LLP v. Mr. Sumati Prasad Bafna & Ors. 1.3. The vital essence of this additional duty imposed upon the party claiming a right to a property which is a subject matter of a pending proceeding, is only to aid a third-party to exercise its due diligence and obviate the possibility of any dishonesty, misrepresentation or fraud by a party in to gain an undue advantage or benefit despite the pendency of proceedings – However, if the absence of notice registration were to render the doctrine entirely inapplicable, it would lead to exploitation of procedural gaps by parties who deliberately delay or avoid registering such notices to defeat substantive rights of the parties and undermine the very sanctity of judicial proceedings – Such an interpretation would lead to a very chilling effect whereby, third parties despite being expected to verify the title and status of the property would simply abdicate their duty to conduct thorough due diligence in transactions involving immovable properties or that despite being fully aware of the pendency of such proceedings would be able to deviously claim absolute rights to such property or worse, mischievously execute back-dated agreements in collusion with a party to a lis prior to registration of such notice of pendency to circumventing the very proceedings and render them infructuous.
