[Emphasis supplied] 146. While both Article 9 and Section 9 seemingly restrict dual citizenship, they operate in different time spheres. As was held by this court in Izhar Ahmed Khan (supra), while Article 9 contemplates the denial of Indian citizenship to a person who had acquired foreign 107 Nationality Law of People’s Republic of China, 1980, Article 9. 108 Japan’s Nationality Law, 1950, Article 11. 109 Kuwait, Ministerial Decree No. 15 of 1959 Promulgating the Nationality Law, Article 11. 1070 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports citizenship before the Constitution came into force, Section 9 deals with the acquisition of foreign citizenship after the commencement of the Constitution. 147. However, while they operate in different time spheres, a common theme that runs across both these provisions is the restriction on dual citizenship. Using these provisions, the Petitioners have urged that since Section 6A does not mandate the express renunciation of the immigrants’ previous citizenship before granting them Indian citizenship, Section 6A runs counter to these two constitutional and statutory provisions. 148. At the outset, even if it is assumed that Section 6A grants dual citizenship, it does not run counter to Article 9. We say so for the reason that these two provisions operate in different fields. As discussed above, Article 9 restricts a person possessing foreign citizenship from acquiring citizenship under Articles 5, 6, and 8. However, Section 6A does not grant citizenship under these provisions and is rather a separate method enacted by Parliament by virtue of its power under Article 11. The question of conflict between Article 9 and Section 6A, therefore does not arise at all. 149. Further, Section 6A also does not conflict with Section 9 because Section 6A does not override the scheme of Section 9 and must be read complementarily thereto. In case an immigrant who has been granted citizenship by Section 6A is found to have dual citizenship, Section 9 can always be invoked to hold that such person has ceased to be an Indian citizen. By virtue of Section 9(2), read with Rule 40 of Citizenship Rules, 2009, the Central Government will determine the question of such acquisition of foreign citizenship as per the detailed procedure prescribed under Schedule III of the aforementioned Rules.110 Since Section 6A is not a safe harbor from Section 9 and is rather subject to the scheme of restricting dual citizenship, it is not in conflict with Section 9 of the Citizenship Act. 150. However, Section 6A, by operation of law, presumes the renunciation of previous citizenship. As was discussed before in paragraph 25, Section 6A(2) and 6A(3) grant citizenship to immigrants, with a 110 Akbar Khan Alam Khan v. Union of India, AIR 1962 SC 70, para 5; State v. Syed Mohd.

If such forms are not filed, and the immigrants choose to retain Indian citizenship, the presumption is that the person is an Indian citizen only and has foregone their previous citizenship.
