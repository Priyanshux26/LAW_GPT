The learned APTEL further found that withholding of past payments, including towards taxes and duties by the DISCOMS, is in violation of the provisions of the PPAs, which casts a specific mandate on the procurer to honour the invoices raised, irrespective of dispute, and impose a specific B bar against unilateral deductions/setting off. The ‘Change in Law’ events will have to accrue from the date on which Rules, s, Notifications are issued by the instrumentalities of the State. Even in spite of this finding, the DISCOMS are pursuing litigations after litigations. When the PPA itself provides a mechanism for payment of compensation on the ground of ‘Change in Law’, C unwarranted litigation, which wastes the time of the Court as well as adds to the ultimate cost of electricity consumed by the end consumer, ought to be avoided. Ultimately, the huge cost of litigation on the part of DISCOMS as well as the Generators adds to the cost of electricity that is supplied to the end consumers. D [Paras 128, 169 , 174-176][230-A; 237-A-E; 240-C-G; 241-A-C] 18.2 It is further to be noted that the appeal to this Court under Section 125 of the Electricity Act, 2003 is only permissible on any of the grounds as specified in Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. As such, the appeal to this Court would E be permissible only on substantial questions of law. However, as already observed herein, even in cases where well-reasoned concurrent s are passed by the Electricity Regulatory Commissions and the learned APTEL, the same are challenged by the DISCOMS as well as the Generators. On account of pendency of litigation, which in some of the cases in this batch F has been more than 5 years, non-payment of dues would entail paying of heavy carrying cost to the Generators by the DISCOMS, which, in turn, will be passed over to the end consumer. As a result, it will be the end consumer who would be at sufferance. Such unnecessary and unwarranted litigation needs to be curbed. G [Paras 179][241-E-H] 18.3 The Union of India through Ministry of Power (“MoP”) is therefore, appealed to evolve a mechanism so as to ensure timely payment by the DISCOMS to the Generating Companies, H 196 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A which would avoid huge carrying cost to be passed over to the end consumers. The Union of India, through MoP, may also evolve a mechanism to avoid unnecessary and unwarranted litigation, the cost of which is also passed on to the ultimate consumer.
