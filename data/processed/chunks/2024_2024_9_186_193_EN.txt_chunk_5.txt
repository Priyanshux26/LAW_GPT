11. The next argument raised by the appellant taking shelter of Army Rule 103 is referred only to be rejected for the reason that the protection under this rule is available only where a fit person has been appointed as a Judge Advocate. If the person so appointed is not fit to act and perform the duties of the Judge Advocate as held in Charanjit Singh Gill (supra), Rule 103 would not come to the rescue of the appellant. Moreover, such argument has already been rejected by this Court in paragraph 18 of the report in Charanjit Singh Gill (supra). 12. In view of the forgoing discussion, we find no substance in this Civil Appeal which deserves to be and is hereby dismissed. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
