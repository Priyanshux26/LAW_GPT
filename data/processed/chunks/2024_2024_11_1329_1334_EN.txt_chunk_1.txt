Leave granted. 2. These appeals arise from the and passed by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh dated 19.10.2019 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1331 Kirpal Singh v.

The short question that arises for consideration is whether the period commencing from 20.10.2011 to 20.01.2012 should be condoned under Section 14 of the Limitation Act while reckoning the period of limitation for filing objections under Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 19961 incorporated in the National Highways Act, 1956.2 3. The facts relevant for our decision are that the land belonging to the appellant was acquired under the NH Act leading to passing of an award dated 25.07.2011. Application for a certified copy of the award was made on 12.08.2011 and the same was received on 08.09.2011. Thereafter, a Regular First Appeal was filed before the High Court on 20.10.2011 on an erroneous understanding. 4. The Registry of the High Court notified certain defects on 09.11.2011 and it is said to have been received by the concerned Advocate only on 20.01.2012. It is only thereafter when the appellant came to know about the appropriate action available to him, being the statutory remedy under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, and he took steps and instituted proceedings under Section 34 of the said Act on 23.02.2012. 5. The District Judge took up the application under Section 34 of the Act and by his dated 16.05.2012 dismissed the same on the ground that it is barred by limitation as determined by this Court in the case of Union of India Vs. Popular Construction Co.3 The appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act was also dismissed by the impugned before us. 6. Mr. Gaurav Agarwal, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant has submitted that his client is entitled to the exclusion of period from 20.10.2011 to 20.01.2012 under Section 14 of the Limitation Act. For this purpose, he relied on the of this Court in Consolidated Engineering Enterprises vs. Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department and Others.4 The relevant portion of the is quoted hereunder: 1 Hereinafter referred to as “the Arbitration Act” 2 Hereinafter referred to as “the NH Act” 3 [2001] Supp. 3 SCR 619 : 2002 (1) RCR (Civil) 124 4 [2008] 5 SCR 1108 : (2008) 7 SCC 169 1332 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “23. At this stage it would be relevant to ascertain whether there is any express provision in the Act of 1996, which excludes the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act. On review of the provisions of the Act of 1996 this Court finds that there is no provision in the said Act which excludes the applicability of the provisions of Section 14 of the said Act….. Hence, Section 43 incorporating the Limitation Act will apply to the proceedings in the arbitration as it applies to the proceedings of a suit in the court.
