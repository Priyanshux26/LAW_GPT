11. The aforesaid question arose since in case of some of the National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries, the ESZ areas are less than one kilometer. In some, it is as less as 500 meters and in some others, it D is even less than 500 meters. 12. We, therefore, clarified that even in case where the ESZ boundaries are less than one kilometer from the Protected Area, the ban on mining shall extend upto a distance of one kilometer from the boundary of such areas. E 13. It will further be relevant to refer to paragraph 66.1 of our dated 26thApril, 2023, which reads thus: “66(i) The MoEF & CC and all the State/Union Territory Governments shall strictly follow the provisions in the said th Guidelines dated 9 February 2011 and so also the provisions F contained in the ESZs notifications pertaining to the respective Protected Areas with regard to prohibited activities, regulated activities and permissible activities;” 14. It could thus clearly be seen that we have directed that MoEF as well as all the State Governments/Union Territories shall strictly follow G the provisions in the Guidelines dated 9th February, 2011, as also the provisions contained in the ESZs notifications pertaining to the respective Protected Areas with regard to prohibited activities, regulated activities and permissible activities. H 640 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 15. As such, our directions are very much clear. Whatever is prohibited under the 2011 guidelines and whatever is additionally prohibited under the specific ESZ notifications of the particular Protected Areas have to be strictly followed. 16. The perusal of paragraph 40 of the dated 26thApril B 2023 would reveal that the very first activity, which is contained in Annexure-I of the Guidelines, is commercial mining and the same is prohibited. 17. Apart from that, it will also be relevant to refer to paragraph 4 of the Notification dated 15thOctober, 2020 vide which a final notification had been notified in so far as the ESZ for Radhanagari Sanctuary is C concerned, which reads thus: “4.
