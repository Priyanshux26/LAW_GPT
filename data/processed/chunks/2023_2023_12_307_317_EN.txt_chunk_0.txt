Delay condoned. 2. Leave granted. 3. The main question which arises for adjudication in this appeal is as to whether the Registrar of Society, empowered to grant registration under West Bengal Societies Registration Act 1961, also has the power to cancel such registration. There is no specifi c provision in the statute granting such authority the power to review or cancel his own decision. The root of the dispute lies in what appears to be a confl ict between two groups of CHEN KHOI KUI v. LIANG MIAO SHENG & ORS.
