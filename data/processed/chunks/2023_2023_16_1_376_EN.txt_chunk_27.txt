To concur with the President in accordance with Article 370(1) (d) is a privilege and not a function and thus could not have been exercised by the President, even under Article 356.73 32. CO 273 dated 6 August 2019 is unconstitutional for the following reasons: a. CO 273 states that the President, on the recommendations of the Parliament, had declared that all the clauses of Article 370 have ceased to be operative, except a clause that eff ectively applies the Constitution of India mutatis mutandis to the State of Jammu and Kashmir74; b. Consequent to the invalidity of CO 272, CO 273 is void ab initio for the same reasons as stated above in respect of CO 27275; c. CO 273 was issued in exercise of power under Article 370(3). However, there was no “recommendation” from a representative body competent to issue such a recommendation under the 72 Written Submissions of Gopal Sankaranarayanan Senior Advocate on Behalf of the Petitioner; State Bank of India vs Santosh Gupta (2017) 2 SCC 538, Written Submissions On Behalf Of The Intervenor By Dr. Menaka Guruswamy, Senior Advocate; Written Submission On Behalf Of Impleader By Manish Tewari & Mr. Abhimanyu Tewari. 73 Written Submissions of Gopal Sankaranarayanan Senior Advocate on Behalf of the Petitioner. 74 Written Submissions of Mr. Gopal Subramanium, Senior Advocate on behalf of the Petitioner. 75 Written Submissions of Mr. Gopal Subramanium, Senior Advocate on behalf of the Petitioner; Written Submissions On Behalf Of The Intervenor By Dr. Menaka Guruswamy, Senior Advocate. 44 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. proviso to Article 370(3). Since the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly is mandatory under the proviso to Article 370(3), and no such recommendation could have been obtained in view of the non-existence of the Constituent Assembly at the relevant time, CO 273 is ultra vires Article 370(3).76 The proviso to Article 370(3) was included to give power to the people of the State to decide whether they wanted to integrate with India77; d. The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir was the sole authority to determine whether Article 370 ought to continue to exist. After its dissolution, no such determination could have been made. The Constituent Assembly had already expressed its desire to not abrogate the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Therefore, the President had no power to act contrary to the desire of the Constituent Assembly.78 The intention was to make it a temporary power exercisable only by the Constituent Assembly, and (without prejudice), by the people of the State to abrogate Article 37079; e. Even assuming CO 272 was valid to the extent that it substituted the Constituent Assembly with the Legislative Assembly, even then the requirement of recommendation was not satisfi ed since CO 273 was issued at a time when the Proclamation under Article 356 was in force and the Legislative Assembly was not in existence80; 76 Outline of Submissions on Behalf of the Petitioners by Raju Ramachandran, Senior Advocate. 77 Written Submissions on Behalf of Mr. Kapil Sibal.
