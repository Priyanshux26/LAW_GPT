36995/2019 and other allied special leave petitions. Therefore, so far as the landowners are concerned, the impugned common and passed by the High Court had attained finality and the present C appeals are required to be considered at the instance of HSIIDC only. Arguments of the learned counsel for the land acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005 3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has vehemently submitted that the High Court has seriously erred in enhancing D the amount of compensation to Rs. 29,54,000/- per acre with respect to the land acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005. It is submitted that while enhancing the amount of compensation to Rs. 29,54,000/- per acre for the land acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005, the High Court has relied upon the builder’s sale deeds produced as Exhibits P43 & P44 E and has not considered the sale deeds produced by the State. It is submitted that the High Court has wrongly interpreted Section 25 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, ‘the 1894 Act’) and has not considered the sale deeds produced by the State. 3.1 It is further submitted that even otherwise the High Court F ought to have appreciated that the lands acquired were all agricultural lands and therefore while assessing the compensation, the High Court ought not to have relied upon and/or considered the builder’s sale deeds. 3.2 It is further submitted that the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that in the surrounding areas, the lands were already G under acquisition commencing from the notification dated 13.08.2004. It is submitted that therefore the market price/value of the lands as on 13.08.2004 ought to have been considered. It is submitted that even while remanding the matters to the High Court, this Court specifically observed that the value of the lands as on 13.08.2004 shall be the determinative factor. It is submitted that instead while assessing the H HARYANA STATE INDUSTRIAL & INFRASTRUCTURE 1021 DEVELOPMENT CORP. LTD. v. SATPAL [M. R. SHAH, J.] compensation, the High Court has relied upon the sale deeds produced A as Exhibits P43 & P44 dated 15.4.2005. 3.3 It is further submitted that even otherwise and assuming that the High Court was right in relying upon the sale deeds produced as Ex. P43 & P44, even in that case also and even as observed and held by the High Court in giving a 50% cut, the High Court ought not to have enhanced B the amount of compensation to Rs. 29,54,000/- per acre. It is submitted that if the main of two sale deeds (Ex. P43 & P44) is taken and thereafter 50% cut, as adopted by the High Court, is applied, in that case, the compensation assessed would come to Rs. 24,43,693/- per acre. It is submitted that therefore the High Court has committed a very serious and grave error in determining and awarding compensation @ Rs. C 29,54,000/- per acre for the lands acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005.
