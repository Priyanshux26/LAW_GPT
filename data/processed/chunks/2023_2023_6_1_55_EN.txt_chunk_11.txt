It was argued that the provisions of the UAPA and Rules 2008 framed thereunder make the grant of sanction, time bound. 12. It was vociferously submitted by both the learned Counsel that the extension of time from 90 to 180 days read together with Rules E 3 and 4 respectively of the Rules 2008 referred to above, makes the grant of sanction mandatorily time bound. The same leads to only one conclusion that the sanction must accompany for it to be considered a final report. 13. It was argued that since the chargesheet in the case on hand F was filed on 15.11.2019, the material collected by the investigating agency should have been received by the competent authority on 15.11.2019 itself. The report of the competent authority should have been ready seven days thereafter, i.e., by 22.11.2019. In view of Rule 4, the sanction should have been granted by 29.11.2019. However, according to both the learned counsel, the report was filed only on 12.03.2021 i.e., after a G delay of one year and three months. The sanction was granted on 17.03.2021 i.e., beyond the period of 180 days which expired on 10.03.2020. The default bail application was instituted on 14.12.2020. 14. It was further argued that the NIA after taking over the investigation on 22.01.2020 was left with 49 days to file or place on H JUDGEBIR SINGH @ JASBIR SINGH SAMRA @ JASBIR 17 v. NATIONAL INVESTIGATION AGENCY [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] record the appropriate sanction before the expiry of the limit of 180 A days. The default bail application was filed on 14.12.2020. The sanction, which was granted only on 17.03.2021, ought to have been granted on 29.11.2019 in view of the time period prescribed by Rules 3 and 4 respectively of the 2008 Rules referred to above. In such circumstances, both the learned counsel submitted that such a delayed sanction even if B otherwise valid cannot defeat the indefeasible right of the accused persons to seek default bail. 15. The second limb of the submission canvassed by both the learned counsel appearing for the accused persons is that the chargesheet could not have been filed in the Court of SDJM, Ajnala as the proceedings C under the NIA are to be conducted in the Special Court only notified under Section 22 of the NIA Act. If there is no Special Court notified then before the Sessions Judge. However, in any event, the chargesheet could not have been filed before the Court of Magistrate. It was argued that in view of Section 16 of the NIA Act read with Section 22 of the NIA Act, the provisions of Section 193 of the CrPC would not come into D play. It was argued that the error on the part of investigating agency in filing the chargesheet before the Court of Magistrate and the Magistrate thereafter, committing the case to the Court of Sessions was absolutely contrary to the provisions of the NIA Act and also the provisions of the UAPA, which rendered all subsequent proceedings to be without E jurisdiction and hence, a nullity.
