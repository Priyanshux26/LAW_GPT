The events described above clearly show that the Sanction was granted in haste, without application of mind and for extraneous consideration. As such, the proceedings following such Sanction also stand vitiated. G Reliance is placed upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of K.K Mishra v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2018) 6 SCC 676 (Para 18) and Anirudhsinhji Karansinhji Jadeja v. State of Gujarat (1995) 5 SCC 302 (Para 15); xxii) Further, Ministry’s failure to produce any evidence to H demonstrate that its officers independently applied their minds to UNION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER V. DELOITTE HASKINS 1003 AND SELLS LLP [M. R. SHAH, J.] the 2nd Interim SFIO Report is also contrary to the principles A relating to duty of disclosure since disclosure would protect the fairness of the proceedings and also enhance the transparency of the process. Reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of T.Takano v. SEBI, (2022) 8 SCC 162 (Para 62.3); xxiii) It is therefore submitted that the Sanction is bad in B law and the Bombay High Court rightly quashed the same; xxiv) A mandatory prerequisite to jurisdiction is the existence of a valid sanction. Therefore, the prosecution becomes incompetent and consequently the proceedings are vitiated and without jurisdiction where no valid sanction is granted. Reliance is placed C on the decisions in the cases of Gokulchand Dwarkadas Morarka v. The King, (1947-48) 75 IA 30; Yusofalli Mulla Noobbhoy v. The King, 1949 Cri LJ 889 ( Para 15); Mohd. Iqbal Ahmed v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1979) 4 SCC 172 (Para 3); D xxv) The Sanction issued by MCA under Section 212(14) is invalid and non-est. In such circumstances, it is submitted that the prosecution initiated by SFIO is absent any sanction and hence a nullity and without any jurisdiction. 4.2 Learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 in E Criminal Appeal No. 2300/2011 – Hari Sankaran, in addition, has further submitted that in the present matter no final investigation report has been filed by the SFIO qua Hari Sankaran. It is submitted that the second report is not in the nature of final investigation report qua Hari Sankaran. It is submitted that since the second report was not a final investigation report qua Hari Sankaran, direction for prosecution in question could not F have been issued and therefore consequently the complaint could not have been filed qua Hari Sankaran. 4.3 Making above submissions and relying upon the aforesaid decisions, it is prayed by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ petitioners to dismiss the present appeals and uphold the G impugned and passed by the High Court. Analysis and Interpretation of Section 140(5)of the Companies Act, 2013: 5. Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 titled as “Removal, Resignation of Auditor and Giving of Special Notice” appears in Chapter X of the H 1004 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A Act which is titled as “Audit and Auditors”. Therefore, Chapter X is a special provision under the new Act with respect of “Audit and Auditors”.
