to them clearly and whether they got a fair chance to defend themselves. If the answer is in the affi rmative, then necessarily this Court will have to proceed further and examine as to whether accused can be convicted for the off ence not charged and if the answer is in the negative it would result in acquittal of the accused for said off ence. In the instant case the dying declaration of the deceased would clearly indicate that deceased was mentally traumatized and she was unable to tolerate the torture and harassment meted out by the accused person on account of which she committed suicide. It is this taunting or mental torture which she could not withstand and forced her to commit suicide by self-immolation. In that view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that accused persons are liable to be convicted for the off ence punishable under Section 306 IPC though charge was not framed. The accused (appellant Nos.1 and 2) are now aged about 66 and 61 years respectively. They have already spent one year, one month and 27 days in prison. They do not have any past history of criminal record. Hence, a lenient view has to be taken while imposing the sentence. 30. For the reasons afore-stated the appeal is allowed in part. The and of conviction passed by the Sessions Court in SC No.35 of 2011 dated 14.09.2012 as affi rmed in Criminal Appeal No.2847 of 2012 by dated 20.07.2022 is hereby modifi ed. The appellants are acquitted for the off ences punishable under Section 304B IPC and Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act and convicted for the off ence punishable under Section 306 and Section 498A read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced to imprisonment for the period already undergone with fi ne of Rs.5000/- each and in default to pay the fi ne to undergo one month simple imprisonment for each of the off ence.
