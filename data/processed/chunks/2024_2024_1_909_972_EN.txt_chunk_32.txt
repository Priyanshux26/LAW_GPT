It is further to be noted that the word “any” in the said case was suffixed by the word “one”, still the Court held that the words “any one” would mean “all” and not “one”. It is to be noted that in the present case, the legislature has not employed the word “one” after the word “any”. It is settled law that it has to be construed that every single word employed or not employed by the legislature has a purpose behind it. 121. On the very date on which the in Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar [Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 : AIR 1961 SC 838] was pronounced, the same Constitution Bench also pronounced the in Banwarilal Agarwalla [Banwarilal Agarwalla v. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 957 Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v. MB Power (Madhya Pradesh) Limited & Ors. State of Bihar, (1962) 1 SCR 33 : AIR 1961 SC 849], wherein the Constitution Bench observed thus : (Banwarilal Agarwalla case [Banwarilal Agarwalla v. State of Bihar, (1962) 1 SCR 33 : AIR 1961 SC 849], AIR p. 850, para 3) “3. The first contention is based on an assumption that the word “any one” in Section 76 means only “one of the Directors, and only one of the shareholders”. This question as regards the interpretation of the word “any one” in Section 76 was raised in Criminal Appeals Nos. 98 to 106 of 1959 (Chief Inspector of Mines [Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 : AIR 1961 SC 838], etc.) and it has been decided there that the word “any one” should be interpreted there as “every one”. Thus under Section 76 every one of the shareholders of a private company owning the mine, and every one of the Directors of a public company owning the mine is liable to prosecution. No question of violation of Article 14 therefore arises.” (emphasis supplied) 122. Another Constitution Bench of this Court in Tej Kiran Jain [Tej Kiran Jain v. N. Sanjiva Reddy, (1970) 2 SCC 272] was considering the provisions of Article 105 of the Constitution of India and, particularly, the immunity as available to the Member of Parliament “in respect of anything said … in Parliament”. The Constitution Bench observed thus : (SCC p. 274, para 8) “8. In our it is not possible to read the provisions of the article in the way suggested. The article means what it says in language which could not be plainer. The article confers immunity inter alia in respect of “anything said … in Parliament”. The word “anything” is of the widest import and is equivalent to “everything”. The only limitation arises from the words “in Parliament” which means during the sitting of Parliament and in the course of the business of Parliament. We are concerned only with speeches in Lok Sabha. Once it was proved that Parliament was sitting and its business was being transacted, anything said during the course of that business was immune from proceedings in any Court this immunity is not only complete but is as it should be.
