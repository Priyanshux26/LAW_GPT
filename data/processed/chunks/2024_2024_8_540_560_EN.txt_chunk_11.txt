This Court generally does not declare prospective overruling when upholding the legislative competence of legislatures. In Municipal Council, Kota v. Delhi Cloth & General Mills Co. Ltd.,25 this Court was called upon to decide the validity of the dharmada tax levied and collected by the Municipal Council. The High Court held that the Municipal Council was not authorized to collect the tax. Further, the 22 Golak Nath (supra) [53]; Synthetics & Chemicals Ltd v. State of U P (1990) 1 SCC 109 [89] 23 Gaurav Kumar v. Union of India, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1841 [108] 24 India Cement Ltd v. State of T N (1990) 1 SCC 12 [35]; Orissa Cement Ltd v. State of Orissa (1991) Supp (1) SCC 430 [69] 25 [2001] 2 SCR 287 : (2001) 3 SCC 654 556 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports High Court directed the State government to refund the collections made to the assesses. In the appeal, a two-Judge Bench of this Court upheld the competence of the Municipal Council to levy the tax. It also set aside the of the High Court granting refunds to the assesses. 16. In Jindal Stainless Ltd. v. State of Haryana,26 a Bench of nine Judges of this Court held that a non-discriminatory tax does not per se constitute a restriction on the right to free trade, commerce and intercourse guaranteed under Article 301. This Court overruled long- standing precedents that held that taxes, except for compensatory taxes, offend Article 301.27 In that case, the counsel specifically submitted that the should be given a prospective effect.28 However, the decision was given a retrospective effect. In her concurring opinion, Justice Banumathi dealt with the issue raised by the assesses about payment/refund of tax in case the validity of the legislation was upheld or otherwise. The learned Judge rejected the claim of the assesses for refund of taxes thus: “481. It is well settled that a claim of refund can be allowed only when the claimant establishes that he has not passed on the tax burden to the consumers. No refund can be granted so as to cause windfall gain to any person when he has not suffered the burden of tax. The possibility of the tax burden having been passed on to the consumers by the assessees cannot be ruled out in the present case. Applying the law laid down above to the present case, it emerges that the assessees cannot claim refund irrespective of whether the impugned legislations are declared valid or unconstitutional. Unless the assessees establish that they have not passed on the tax burden to the consumers, they cannot make a claim for refund and unjustly enrich themselves.” (emphasis added) 26 [2016] 10 SCR 1 : (2017) 12 SCC 1 27 Atiabari Tea Co.
