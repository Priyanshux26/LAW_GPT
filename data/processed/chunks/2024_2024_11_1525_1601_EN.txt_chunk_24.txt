[2024] 11 S.C.R. 1563 M/s Bharti Airtel Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Central Excise, Pune 11.2.6 From the above, it appears that the definition of “goods” under the Sales of Goods Act, 1930 seems to be the basis of the term “goods” in other Statutes. Hence, we would primarily rely on the definition given in the Sale of Goods Act. 11.2.7 The items in consideration viz., towers and prefabricated buildings are neither actionable claim nor money, nor do they come within the inclusive clause of the definition, viz., stocks, shares, growing crops, grass, and things attached to forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under contract of sale. 11.2.8 If these items are movable properties, these will be “goods”, in which case our further enquiry will be to examine whether these belong to the category of “capital goods” as enumerated in Rule 2(a)(A) only under which the Assessees will be entitled to claim CENVAT credit under the Rules. 11.2.9 On the other hand, if these are held to be immovable property, as the Revenue insists and also as has been held by the Bombay High Court, we may not be required to proceed further in the enquiry with reference to Rule 2(a)(A) for claim of CENVAT credit on “capital goods”. 11.3 Thus, the focus of our inquiry now will be to ascertain whether these items namely, towers, its parts thereof and prefabricated buildings are movable or immovable properties. 11.3.1 As to what is a movable property has been defined and can be understood from the expansive meaning assigned to it under Section 3(36) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which states that, “movable property shall mean property of every description except immovable property”.
