If the answer to the above said question is to be in the affirmative, as a necessary corollary, if ultimately the convict appears to be entitled D to have an acquittal at the hands of this Court, he should not be kept behind the bars for a pretty long time till the conclusion of the appeal, which usually take very long for decision and disposal. However, while undertaking the exercise to ascertain whether the convict has fair chances of acquittal, what is to be looked into E is something palpable. To put it in other words, something which is very apparent or gross on the face of the record, on the basis of which, the Court can arrive at a prima facie satisfaction that the conviction may not be sustainable. The Appellate Court should not reappreciate the evidence at the stage of Section 389 of the CrPC and try to pick up few lacunas or loopholes here or there in F the case of the prosecution. Such would not be a correct approach. [Para 33][163-B-D] 3. In the case on hand, what the High Court has done is something impermissible. High Court has gone into the issues like political rivalry, delay in lodging the FIR, some over-writings G in the First Information Report etc. All these aspects, will have to be looked into at the time of the final hearing of the appeals filed by the convicts. Upon cursory scanning of the evidence on record, this court is unable to agree with the contentions coming from the Senior Counsel for the convicts that, either there is H OMPRAKASH SAHNI v. JAI SHANKAR CHAUDHARY & 143 ANR. ETC. absolutely no case against the convicts or that the evidence A against them is so weak and feeble in nature, that, ultimately in all probabilities the proceedings would terminate in their favour. For the very same reason this court was unable to accept the contention coming from the convicts through their Senior Counsel that, it would be meaningless, improper and unjust to keep them B behind the bars for a pretty long time till they are found not to be guilty of the charges. [Para 34][163-E-G] 4. In the overall view of the matter, this Court is convinced that the High Court committed a serious error in suspending the substantive of sentence of the convicts and their release C on bail pending the final disposal of their criminal appeals.
