BR-1P-1818 (Sumo), as per the deposition of the second IO, Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54), had been taken under a hire-purchase agreement by the late Devendra Nath Dubey, brother of Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased), from a finance company – SBR Private Limited, Calcutta. The said assertion had remained unchallenged in the cross-examination of Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54). The vehicle No. BR-1P-1818 is also mentioned in the fardbeyan (Exhibit P-50) of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10). Forwarding of the FIR 29. The impugned has observed that the FIR (Exhibits 51 and 51/1) is ante-timed. The High Court, in its reasoning, highlights this as one of the grounds for acquitting the accused. In the present case, the first IO, SSP Yadav, passed away before he could depose. However, registration of the FIR itself is not in doubt and debate and has been deposed to by Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10). We have evidence with regard to the statement of eye-witnesses which were recorded under Section 161 CrPC on the night of occurrence, as is clear from the depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury 20 See Yogesh Singh v. Mahabeer Singh and Others (2017) 11 SCC 195 which refers to several other decisions. See also State of Rajasthan v. Arjun Singh and Others (2011) 9 SCC 115 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1337 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10). The inquest reports of Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu (Exhibits 42/1 and 52) were prepared on the same night and, thereafter, the post-mortem was conducted by Dr. Arvind Kumar Singh (PW-7) at 12:30 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. respectively on 14.06.1998. 30. The occurrence having taken place at night on 13.06.1998, normally the FIR should have been sent to the jurisdictional magistrate on 14.06.1998. However, 14.06.1998 being a Sunday was a holiday. The FIR was forwarded to the jurisdictional magistrate on 15.06.1998. There is, therefore, an explanation for the delay in forwarding a copy of the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate in terms of Section 157 of the CrPC. It is trite law that a delay in forwarding the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate is not fatal to the prosecution case. This Court, in State of Rajasthan v. Daud Khan,21 has examined the case law on the subject and held that when there is a delay in forwarding the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate and the accused raises a specific contention regarding the same, they must demonstrate how this delay has prejudiced their case. Mere delay by itself is not sufficient to discard and disbelieve the case of the prosecution. If the investigation starts in right earnest and there is sufficient material on record to show that the accused were named and pinpointed, the prosecution case can be accepted when evidence implicates the accused. The requirement to dispatch and serve a copy of the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate is an external check against ante dating or ante timing of the FIR to ensure that there is no manipulation or interpolation in the FIR.
