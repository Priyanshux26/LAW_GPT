7. We are supported in taking this view from an earlier of a coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Central Bank of India vs. State of Kerala & Ors., reported in 2009 (4) SCC 94. In the said case, this Court was examining similar provisions contained in Section 38-C of Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959 and Section 26-B of Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963. In paragraph 116 of the report, the position of law on this point has been explained:- “116. The non obstante clauses contained in Section 34(1) of the DRT Act and Section 35 of the Securitisation Act give overriding eff ect to the provisions of those Acts only if there is anything inconsistent contained in any other law or instrument having eff ect by virtue of any other law. In other words, if there is no provision in the other enactments which are inconsistent with the DRT Act or the Securitisation Act, the provisions contained in those Acts cannot override other legislations. Section 38-C of the Bombay Act and Section 26-B of the Kerala Act also contain non obstante clauses and give statutory recognition to the priority of the State’s charge over other debts, which was recognised by Indian High Courts even before 1950. In other words, these sections and similar provisions contained in other State legislations not only create fi rst charge on the property of the dealer or any other person liable to pay sales tax, etc. but also give them overriding eff ect over other laws” 908 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 8. On behalf of the bank, a of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in which one of us (Aniruddha Bose J.) was a member, was relied upon. In that , being the case of Punjab National Bank vs. Union of India & Ors. (2022 INSC 230) implication of a provision similar to Section 35 of the 2005 Act was not in issue. That was a case where bank’s claim was competing with claim of the Union of India on the basis of confi scation of the assessee’s assets under the provisions of Section 173 Q(2) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944. Factually, this case is distinguishable. Another of a coordinate Bench in the case of Union of India & Ors. vs. SICOM Ltd. & Anr., [(2009) 2 SCC 121] was cited on behalf of the bank, in which the principle of priority of crown debt was argued. This authority also did not deal with a specifi c statutory provision creating fi rst charge for State’s tax dues as has been stipulated in Section 35 of the 2005 Act. Thus, ratio of this authority is also not applicable in the facts of this case. 9. We, accordingly, fi nd no error in the under appeal and hence affi rm the said . 10. The appeal shall stand dismissed in the above terms. 11. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. 12. There shall be no as to the costs.
