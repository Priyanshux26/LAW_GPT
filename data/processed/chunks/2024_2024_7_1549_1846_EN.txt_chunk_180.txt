1780 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 12.3 The Court observed that in Hingir-Rampur case, the Orissa Act was a post-Constitution enactment (1952 Act), whereas the Central Act of 1948 was a pre-Constitution law and under Entry 54 - List I “Parliament” had not made the requisite declaration. The previously existing Central law was held not to be within the terms of Entry 54 - List I and therefore, the State enactment was held to continue to be operative. But later when the Central law i.e. MMDR Act, 1957 contains the requisite declaration by the Union Parliament under Entry 54 - List I and that Act covers the same field as the Act of 1948 (Central Act) in regard to mines and mineral development, it was observed that unless there were any material differences between the scope and ambit of the Central Act 53 of 1948 and that of the Act of 1957, the matter was concluded. Consequently, the writ petition was dismissed. Baijnath Kedia: 13. A Constitution Bench of this Court had the occasion to consider the provisions of the MMDR Act, 1957 in light of the Bihar Land Reforms Act and the amendment thereto. In Baijnath Kedia, it was the contention that amendment of Section 10 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act was ultra vires the Constitution and that Rule 20(2) did not legally entitle recovery of the dead rent, royalty, etc. as mentioned in the Schedules to the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1964. The dispute arose on account of the appellants therein receiving letters to the effect that in view of the amendment to Section 10 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 and all leases for minor minerals having stood statutorily substituted by the corresponding terms and conditions by the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1964, the rent and royalty etc. in respect of minor minerals in the State (irrespective of the date on which the lease was granted) were to be paid as per the aforesaid Rules with effect from 27.10.1964. The appellant therein denied their liability to pay. The State of Bihar submitted that the terms of the original lease having being validly altered by the operation of the second proviso to Section 10(2) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 in addition to Section 10A of the said Act, the State Government was entitled to collect dead rent, royalty etc. from the lessees who had been granted lease so long as there was a lease subsisting on the date of the commencement of the amendment.
