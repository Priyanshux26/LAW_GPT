The Revenue Authorities were directed to consider the case of the concerned goods of the Appellant-Company afresh in light of the observations made in the said s. 8. In the meanwhile, a clarification was sought from the Office of the Collector of Legal Metrology and Director of Consumer Affairs by the Appellant-Company in the said regard and it was responded vide Letter dated 04.01.2006 wherein, the view taken by the Appellant- Company by placing reliance on Rule 29 of the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as “Packaged Commodities Rules 1977”) was affirmed. 9. Placing reliance on the Letter dated 04.01.2006 and other materials on record, the Appellant-Company moved three applications before [2024] 9 S.C.R. 59 Baccarose Perfumes and Beauty Products Pvt. Ltd v. Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr. the Settlement Commission and immunity was granted to it under the CE Act 1944, CA 1962, and IPC 1860 vide Common No. 248/Final /CEX/KNA/2007 dated 21.08.2007. 10. The Investigation Officer, thereafter, was pleased to move a Closure Report dated 05.03.2008 before the learned Special Judge. The Court, however, rejected the said Closure Report vide dated 01.06.2010, and instead directed for registration of a Special Case against the accused persons, including the Appellant-Company. This case came to be registered as CBI Special Case No. 48 of 2010. 11. The Appellant-Company moved the High Court of Gujarat by filing a Special Criminal Application challenging the above which was dismissed on 12.12.2011. Aggrieved, the Appellant-Company moved this Court through filing of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 14430 of 2013. This Court was pleased to condone the delay in filing, but while dismissing the petition vide dated 26.07.2013 observed that only cognizance had been taken by the learned Special Judge and directed issuance of summons to the Appellant-Company, and thereby, it was not an appropriate stage to interfere. However, liberty was granted to the Appellant-Company to pursue and plead for discharge at the time of hearing of charges. 12. In pursuance of the said liberty, the Appellant-Company moved an application for discharge before the learned Special Judge. One of the grounds was that the Appellant-Company had been granted immunity under the CE Act 1944, CA 1962, and IPC 1860 through dated 20.08.2007 passed by the competent authority, i.e., the Settlement Commission and pressed into service the observations made by this Court in General Officer Commanding, Rashtriya Rifles v. CBI1 and Another, Jamuna Singh and Others v. Bhadai Shah,2 and Devarapalli Lakshminarayana Reddy and Others v. V. Narayana Reddy and Others 3 to the effect that mere filing of FIR with the police, which is subsequently forwarded to the Court, does not amount to institution of prosecution. Furthermore, that the Appellant-Company is not a “public servant” vis-à-vis Section 13(1) (b) read with Section 13(2) of the PCA 1998. Besides this, the Court had already refused to accept contentions of the Respondent-Agency 1 [2012] 5 SCR 599 : (2012) 6 SCC 228 2 [1964] 5 SCR 37 : 1963 SCC OnLine SC 263 3 [1976] Supp.
