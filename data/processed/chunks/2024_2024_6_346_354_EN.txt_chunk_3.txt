13. Athar Pervez v. State8, a of the Delhi High Court authored by one of us (Sanjiv Khanna), on the power to grant interim bail in cases registered under the NDPS Act, in addition to the s noted, refers to Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra 4 [2010] 5 SCR 702 : (2010) 15 SCC 154 5 [2000] 1 SCR 945 : (2000) 3 SCC 409 6 [2000] Supp. 3 SCR 703 : (2000) 8 SCC 437 7 For short, the ‘NDPS Act’. 8 2016 SCC Online Del 6662 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 351 Arvind Kejriwal v. Directorate of Enforcement and Others9, which decision leans on the Constitutional Bench in Shri Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia and Others v. State of Punjab10, and Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited and Another v. Brojo Nath Ganguly and Another11, and observes: “20. The expression “interim” bail is not defined in the Code. It is an innovation by legal neologism which has gained acceptance and recognition. The terms, “interim” bail/“interim” suspension of sentence, have been used and accepted as part of legal vocabulary and are well known expressions. The said terms are used in contradistinction and to distinguish release on regular bail during pendency of trial or appeal till final adjudication. Applications for “interim” suspension or bail are primarily moved and prayed for, when the accused or convict is not entitled to or cannot be granted regular bail or suspension of sentence, or the application for grant of regular bail is pending consideration and is yet to be decided. “Interim” bail entailing temporary release can be granted under compelling circumstances and grounds, even when regular bail would not be justified. Intolerable grief and suffering in the given facts, may justify temporary release, even when regular bail is not warranted. Such situations are not difficult to recount, though making a catalogue would be an unnecessary exercise.” 14. Power to grant interim bail is commonly exercised in a number of cases. Interim bail is granted in the facts of each case. This case is not an exception. 15. The prosecution has rightly pointed out that the appellant – Arvind Kejriwal had failed to appear in spite of nine (9) notices/summons, first of which was issued in October 2023. This is a negative factor, but there are several other facets which we are required to take into consideration. The appellant – Arvind Kejriwal is the Chief Minister of Delhi and a leader of one of the national parties. No doubt, serious accusations have been made, but he has not been convicted. He 9 [2010] 15 SCR 201 : (2011) 1 SCC 694 10 [1980] 3 SCR 383 : (1980) 2 SCC 565 11 [1986] 2 SCR 278 : (1986) 3 SCC 156 352 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports does not have any criminal antecedents. He is not a threat to the society. The investigation in the present case has remained pending since August 2022. Arvind Kejriwal was arrested, as noted above, on 21.03.2024. More importantly, legality and validity of the arrest itself is under challenge before this Court and we are yet to finally pronounce on the same.
