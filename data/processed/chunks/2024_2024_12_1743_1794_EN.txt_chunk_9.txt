On the strength of Article 21, the petitioner herein has questioned the s at Annexures P-4, P-6 and P-9, dated 29.06.2020, 28.06.2021, 12.10.2021 respectively, passed by respondent No.1, as being illegal and ultra vires the provisions of the NIA Act. Sri Dave submitted that the petitioner also has the protection of laws under Article 14 of the Constitution. That in the instant case alleging offences said to have been committed by the petitioner under the NDPS Act which are non-scheduled offences, the petitioner is sought to be investigated and proceeded against under Scheduled Offences, namely, Sections 17 and 18 of the UAPA (under the provisions of the NIA Act). It was submitted that the investigation into the FIRs registered under the provisions of the NDPS Act vis-à-vis the petitioner, namely, FIR No.20/2020 dated 29.01.2020 and FIR No.23/2020 dated 31.01.2020, vide s dated [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1757 Ankush Vipan Kapoor v. National Investigation Agency 28.06.2021 (Annexure P-6) and dated 12.10.2021 (Annexure P-9) respectively, on the basis of Section 8 of the NIA Act, is illegal and ultra vires the provisions of Section 6 of the NIA Act. 4.1 In this context, learned senior counsel drew our attention to Section 6 of the NIA Act and with particular reference to sub- sections (1) to (4) of Section 6 and sub-section (5) of Section 6 in to contend that there are two ways in which investigation could be handed over to the NIA to investigate a Scheduled Offence under Section 6 of the NIA Act. That the schedule to the NIA Act prescribes the offences under various Acts including some offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). That in the instant case, sub-section (5) of Section 6 was invoked by the Central Government to suo motu refer the investigation of the aforesaid offences registered against the petitioner herein under the NDPS Act by virtue of Annexures P-6 and P-9 which are non-scheduled offences by linking them to FIR No.1/2018 dated 12.08.2018 registered at PS ATS, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, under Sections 8(c), 21(c), 24, 25, 27A and 29 of the NDPS Act and Sections 17 and 18 of the UAPA against some other accused who have nothing to do with the petitioner herein. That merely because by dated 29.6.2020 (Annexure P-4) in light of the aforesaid FIR, Sections 17 and 18 of UAPA being Scheduled Offences were said to have been attracted and the said FIR was directed to be investigated by the NIA, Section 8 could not have been invoked by the Central Government to link the offences registered against the petitioner under the NDPS Act with Sections 17 and 18 of the UAPA Act, thereby handing over the investigation of the offences which had been investigated by the Punjab State Police to the NIA vide Annexures P-6 and P-9. Hence, Annexures P-4, P-6 and P-9 are assailed in the writ petitions. It was contended that the investigation that was handed over to the NIA by the Central Government by virtue of Annexure P-4 dated 29.6.2020 was in respect of FIR No.1/2018 dated 12.08.2018 registered at PS ATS, Ahmedabad, Gujarat under certain provisions of the NDPS Act on the premise that Sections 17 and 18 of the UAPA Act were also attracted in the case against certain accused persons.
