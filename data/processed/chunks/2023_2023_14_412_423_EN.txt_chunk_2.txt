There was a condition in the promissory note that the full and fi nal payment will be made by December, 2016. The respondent No.2 failed to comply with the condition in the promissory note but on 28.04.2017 issued a cheque bearing No.548045 drawn on the Vijaya Bank, J.P. Marg, Visakhapatnam for a sum of Rs. 10,00,000/- towards partial discharge of the debt. The cheque when presented for collection was returned by the Bank on 15.05.2017 due to insuffi cient funds to honour the cheque. The appellant got issued a legal notice dated 24.05.2017 to respondent No.2, which was replied to by respondent No.2 on 01.06.2017. The appellant sent a rejoinder to the said reply on 03.06.2017. Respondent No.2 sent a reply to the said rejoinder on 07.06.2017. The appellant thereafter fi led complaints under Section 138 of the NI Act on 11.07.2017 before the Special Magistrate, Vishakhapatnam vide CC No. 681 of 2017 and analogous complaints. The learned Special Magistrate in accordance with law, took cognizance of the complaint under Section 138 of NI Act against the respondent No.2 - accused vide dated 14.09.2018 and ed the issue of summons. 4. The fact situation in the analogous appeals is also similar except for the date of the promissory note and the date of the cheque. However, in all the promissory notes the period for repayment indicated is the same and all other facts arising for consideration are similar. Hence for the purpose of narration and consideration of the law, the facts relating to the appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.7455 of 2019 is referred herein. 5. The respondent No.2 herein however fi led the petition in CRL.P No.12675 of 2018 and analogous petitions under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (for short ‘CrPC’) before the High Court 416 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. praying to quash proceedings under CC No. 681 of 2017 and analogous complaints. The High Court allowed the petitions fi led under Section 482 CrPC by respondent no.2 herein, noting various s by this Court and the various High Courts, and observing that the limitation for enforcing the promissory notes had expired much prior to the issuance of the cheques in question. As such, it was held this was a fi t case for quashing since the complaint fi led seeking prosecution was not in respect of a legally recoverable debt. 6. Mr. Sanchit Garga, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant while assailing the passed by the High Court, would contend that the High Court did not appreciate that the promissory note executed by respondent No.2 has the binding eff ect of a contract and hence the complaint under Section 138 of NI Act is maintainable when a cheque is drawn to pay wholly or in part, a debt which is enforceable and there is no bar of limitation. The cheque amounts to a promise governed by Section 25 (3) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Such promise which is an agreement is an exception to the general rule that an agreement without consideration is void.
