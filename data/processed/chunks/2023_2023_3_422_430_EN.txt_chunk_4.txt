10748/2016, it is prayed to dismiss the appeals preferred by the developer. F 5. We have heard learned counsel for the respective parties at length. At the outset, it is required to be noted that the principal amount as well as the interest in terms of the (s) of the State Commission G have been paid to the respective complainants/allottees and the only issue involved in these appeals is as to whether the compensation awarded by the State Commission in terms of clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyer Agreement is payable solely by the developer – appellant herein or it is to be shared between the developer and the CHB in the ratio of 70:30? H 428 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A 6. While considering the aforesaid issue, it is required to be noted that the learned arbitrator in the award dated 09.01.2015 in a dispute between the developer and the CHB had specifically directed that any amount payable on account of refund of price, interest or compensation (if and when finally determined by the National Commission/Supreme Court) would be borne by the appellant and the CHB in the ratio of B 70:30. The award passed by the learned arbitrator has attained finality. That thereafter, during the hearing of Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos. 17133-17134/2013 and other allied connected matters, when the award passed by the learned arbitrator was brought to the notice of this Court, this Court specifically observed in paragraphs 6 & 7 as under: C “6. Further, it would be pertinent to note that the Commission has observed that its would be subject to the pending arbitration proceedings between the Developers and the Chandigarh Housing Board. 7. In this context, Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel D would state that in view of the award passed by the Arbitrator the period that is stipulated in the Agreement has been extended from 06.10.2006 to 05.02.2008. We are not inclined to enter into this controversy. If, for any reason, the respondent(s)/buyer(s) file any execution petition 8 for execution of the (s) and E (s) passed by the Commission, the Developer is at liberty to take such objections based on award passed by the Arbitrator. If such objections are raised, it is for the executing Court to consider the same and pass appropriate s in accordance with law.” Even thereafter when this Court disposed of/dismissed Civil Appeal No. 10748/2016, it is observed in paragraphs 12 & 13 as under: F “12. We also note that the finding in the arbitration award dated 09.01.2015 as to the apportionment of liability between the Developer and CHB to pay the principal sum and general compensation, must be given effect. To this extent, we find merit in the argument raised by the learned Senior Counsel for G Respondent No. 1 that the prior National Commission dated 05.03.2013 and the subsequent of this Court dated 21.04.2015 both relegate the inter se apportionment of liability between the Developer and CHB to the arbitration award.
