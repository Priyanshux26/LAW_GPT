1 SCR 697 : (2002) 6 SCC 710 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 245 Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh 68. It is important in this case to appreciate that the Investigating Officer recorded the statement instantly, a day after the incident. He has categorically stated that the medical report did not mention that the condition of the declarant, Tularam, was serious in nature. More importantly, Tularam was able to convey his statement properly. Furthermore, on perusal of the statement, it is clear that the declarant Tularam was in a fit condition as not only did he properly explain the incident but has also markedly specified the role of the Appellant. That apart, the injuries found during the post-mortem examination conducted by P.W.13 and P.W.15 have duly corroborated the statement of deceased Tularam. 69. From the above discussion, it is manifest that the mere non- obtainment of a medical fitness certificate will not deter this Court from considering a properly recorded statement under Section 161 CrPC to be a dying declaration. CONCLUSION : 70. For the reasons stated above, we are satisfied that there are no contradictions or discrepancies in the prosecution case of such a nature that would compel us to take a view different than that of the Trial Court and the High Court. We, therefore, do not find any merit in this appeal, which is, consequently, dismissed. If the Appellant is on bail, his bail bonds are cancelled, and he is directed to surrender and undergo the remainder of the sentence. However, if the Appellant is already in custody, in that event, he shall complete the remainder of the sentence. 71. ed accordingly. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
