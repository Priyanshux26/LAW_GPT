Common good in other words, must be associated with the good of the consumer. He drew our G attention to Section 54 of the Act which provides for power to exempt. He pointed out two notifications granting exemptions which were in favour of rural regional banks. If the appellants legitimately wished to be taken out of the purview of the Act, Section 54 holds the key and there is a 14 (1999) 6 SCC 82 H 844 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A lawful way. As long as there is no exemption, the Act applies to the appellants. He would further contest the case of the appellants that the appellants were running at a loss as a result of a number of mines running at a loss.He would purport to provide figures to demonstrate that the appellants have been making huge sums by way of profits andwhat is more, making it over to the Government of India by way of dividend. B This is besides highlighting the dilution of the shareholding of the Government of India.He would point out that there can be no claim by the appellants that it is carrying on of any sovereign functions. In this regard, he drew our attention to the following decisions. Bangalore Water Supply & Sewerage Board v. A. Rajappa15 (See paragraphs- C 163 and 168), N. Nagendra Rao & Co. v. State of A.P.16 (See paragraphs-9, 13, 19 and 25),Chairman, Railway Board and others v. Chandrima Das(Mrs.) and others17(See paragraphs-38, 41 and 42) and Agricultural Produce Market Committee v. Ashok Harikuni and another18(See paragraphs-21 and 32). 23. Shri M. Mishra, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of one D of the parties in the Transferred Cases would support the respondents in the Appeal. He would point out that in fact, he appears for the Maharashtra Power Generation company. He would submit that the Court may bear in mind that it is not as if the complaint against the appellants is being voiced only by private players like the second respondent in the Appeal. E The acts and omissions of the appellants is being objected to even by public sector units such as his client. He would point out that under the Electricity Act, 2003, the price of power is regulated by the Commission under the said Act. The return on investment is highly regulated. Coal constitutes 60-70 per cent of the costs. The price of coal has a bearing on both the Consumer Price Index as also the Wholesale Price Index. F He would submit that the report of the Director General under the Act brings out the facts. Regarding the contention of the appellants that Writ Courts can go into the question,it is pointed out that the cases may involve facts, which are best dealt with by a Body like the CCI. He drew our attention to the of this Court in Hasan Murtza v. State of Haryana19 and also Employees Provident Fund Commissioner v. G Official Liquidator20.Similar contention in support of the CCI and the 15 (1978) 2 SCC 213 16 (1994)6 SCC 205 17 (2000) 2 SCC 465 18 (2000) 8 SCC 61 19 (2002) 3 SCC 1 H 20 (2011) 10 SCC 727 COAL INDIA LIMITED v.
