164 SUPREME CO[U2R02T3 ]R 2E PSO.CR.RT.S 164 [2023] 2 S.C.R. A RAVI DHINGRA v. THE STATE OF HARYANA (Criminal Appeal No. 987 of 2009) B MARCH 01, 2023 [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL AND B. V. NAGARATHNA, JJ.] Penal Code, 1860 – ss.364A, 363 and 364 – Modification of conviction u/s.364A to s.363 – Appellants convicted u/ss.148, 364A r/w s.149, IPC – Sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 3 C years u/s.148, rigorous imprisonment for life and fine u/s.364A r/w s.149 – On appeal, held: s.364A has three components- kidnapping or abduction of a person and keeping them in detention; threat to cause death or hurt, and the use of kidnapping, abduction, or detention with a demand to pay the ransom; and when the demand D is not met, then causing death – In the present case, there are two statements of PW-21-child victim, one made to the police 2 days after he had returned home from the captivity of appellants and another made before the Trial Court, two years after the initial statement – Three changes are noticed therein, first, a change in the exact timing of the threat; second, the specificity of the delivery E of the threat to kill; and third, omission of the intent behind the threat i.e. to prevent PW-21 from crying out – These details are crucial to proving the second ingredient of the charge u/s.364A i.e, ‘threat resulting in giving rise to a reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to death or hurt’ – Thus, this ingredient was F not proved beyond reasonable doubt – For proving the ingredient of threat, the intimidation of the child victim, for the purpose of making him silent cannot be enough – If the sentence carrying a maximum sentence of death and a minimum sentence of life sentence has such a low evidentiary threshold, the difference between punishments for kidnapping u/ss.363, 364 and 364A shall become G meaningless – Conviction of the appellants u/s.364A is unsustainable – Appellants convicted u/s.363 and sentenced to imprisonment for seven years with fine – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.216. H 164 RAVI DHINGRA v. THE STATE OF HARYANA 165 Partly allowing the appeals, the Court A HELD: 1.1 Section 363 of the IPC punishes the act of kidnapping and Section 364 thereof punishes the offence of kidnapping or abduction of a person in to murder him. Section 364A further adds to the gravity of the offence by involving an instance of coercive violence or substantial threat thereof, to B make a demand for ransom. Accordingly, the maximum punishment for the three crimes is seven years imprisonment; ten years’ imprisonment and imprisonment for life or death, respectively. Under section 364A, it is necessary to prove not only that such kidnapping or abduction has taken place but that C thereafter, the accused threatened to cause death or hurt to such person or by his conduct gave rise to a reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to death or hurt or cause hurt or death to such person in to compel the Government or any foreign State or international, inter-governmental organization or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act or to pay a D ransom.
