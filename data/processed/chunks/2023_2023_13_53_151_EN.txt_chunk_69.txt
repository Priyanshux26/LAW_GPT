This Court in Sadashiv Prasad Singh (supra), made the following observations relevant to the aforesaid discussion, reproduced below: - “21. A perusal of the impugned [Harendar Singh v. State of Bihar, LPA No. 844 2010, dated 17-5-2010 (Pat)] especially paras 8, CELIR LLP v. BAFNA MOTORS (MUMBAI) PVT. 149 LTD. & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] 12 and 13 extracted hereinabove reveal that the impugned came to be passed in to work out the equities between the parties. The entire deliberation at the hands of the High Court were based on off ers and counter-off ers, inter se between the Allahabad Bank, on the one hand, and the objector, Harender Singh on the other, whereas the rights of Sadashiv Prasad Sinha, the auction-purchaser, were not at all taken into consideration. As a matter of fact, it is Sadashiv Prasad Sinha who was to be deprived of the property which came to be vested in him as far back as on 28-8-2008. It is nobody’s case, that at the time of the auction- purchase, the value of the property purchased by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha was in excess of his bid. In fact, the factual position depicted under para 8 of the impugned [Harendar Singh v. State of Bihar, LPA No. 844 2010, dated 17-5-2010 (Pat)] reveals that the escalation of prices had taken place thereafter, and the value of the property purchased by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha was presently much higher than the bid amount.
