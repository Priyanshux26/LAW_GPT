60. It is pertinent to mention that the issue concerning classifi cation has been discussed by us herein above in the matter of Commissioner of Central Excise, Ahmedabad Vs. M/s Urmin Products Private Limited and Others and fi ndings recorded by us in paragraph no. (s) 46,47,48 and 49 supra would be squarely applicable to the facts on hand. 61. Undisputedly, the tribunal as noticed herein above has relied upon the view expressed in M/s Urmin Products Private Limited by it to arrive at a conclusion that the product is to be classifi ed as ‘chewing tobacco’. 62. It is no doubt true that in the instant case, the assessee duly has been declaring the product manufactured by it as ‘chewing tobacco’. However, the fact remains that there was no issue till the Six-digit tariff era which was revoked with the introduction of the Eight-digit tariff head. Pursuant to the same the entry was reorganized and reclassifi ed as ‘chewing tobacco’ (2403 9910), a preparation containing the ‘chewing tobacco’ (2403 9920) and ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ (2403 9930). Circular No. 808/5/2005- CX dated 25.02.2005 came to be issued whereunder classifi cation was COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. AHMEDABAD v. M/S URMIN 611 PRODUCTS P. LTD. AND OTHERS [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] given that the subsisting notifi cation having a six-digit enumeration should be read in terms of the eight-digit of the new Central Excise Tariff . On 01.03.2006, Notifi cation No. 02/2006 came to be issued by virtue of which a Notifi cation No. 13/2002 dated 01.03.2002 was superseded. Thus, the list of products with their respective chapter headings/sub-headings, which were to be covered under the MRP-based assessment in terms of Section 4A of the CE Act, was notifi ed in terms of an Eight-digit tariff . In the said notifi cation ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was left out or was not included for MRP-based assessment. Subsequently, by clarifi catory Notifi cation No. 16/2006 dated 11.07.2006, the product ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was brought back within the MRP-based assessment benefi t. Thus, the burning issue would be between the period 01.03.2006 to 11.07.2006 which in the instant case relates to 01.03.2006 to 10.07.2006. 63. In the instant case, the facts do not disclose there being a change in the declaration of the product manufactured by the present respondent herein, as was in the case with M/s Urmin Products Private Limited. Even otherwise by virtue of the change from Six-digit tariff to Eight-digit tariff era and during the period 01.03.2006 to 11.07.2006. Though the generic word ‘chewing tobacco’ including preparation commonly known as “khara masala, quiwam, dhokta, zarda, sukha, surti” or “chewing tobacco and preparation containing chewing tobacco” got bifurcated or took its new birth by virtue of which the said entry was re-organised and classifi ed under three headings namely ‘chewing tobacco’ (2403 9910), ‘preparations containing chewing tobacco’ (2403 9920) and ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ (2403 9930), the heading ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ did not fi nd a place in the corresponding Notifi cation No. 02/2006 dated 01.03.2006 and thereby the ‘zarda/jarda’ scented tobacco got excluded from the preview of the Notifi cation No.
