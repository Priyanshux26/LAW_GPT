In Nani Sha and Others vs. State of Arunachal Pradesh and Others,21 it was observed that mere existence of a vacancy is not 19 [1990] Supp. 2 SCR 573 : 1992 Supp (1) SCC 272 20 [2006] Suppl. 6 SCR 609 : (2006) 10 SCC 346 21 [2007] 6 SCR 1027 : (2007) 15 SCC 406 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 775 Bihar State Electricity Board and Others v. Dharamdeo Das sufficient for an employee to claim seniority and the date of actual appointment has to be in accordance with the prescribed procedure. In Dinesh Kumar Sharma16 (supra), the following pertinent observations were made : “34. Another issue that deserves consideration is whether the year in which the vacancy accrues can have any relevance for the purpose of determining the seniority irrespective of the fact when the persons are recruited. Here the respondent’s contention is that since the vacancy arose in 1995-1996, he should be given promotion and seniority from that year and not from 1999, when his actual appointment letter was issued by the appellant. This cannot be allowed as no retrospective effect can be given to the of appointment under the Rules nor is such contention reasonable to normal parlance. This was the view taken by this Court in Jagdish Ch. Patnaik v. State of Orissa.”22 22. The spirit behind elevating the right for being considered for promotion to a fundamental right is enshrined in the principle of “equality of opportunity” in relation to matters of employment and appointment to a position under the State. Once employed, the employees are entitled for being considered for promotion to the next higher post subject to their satisfying the eligibility criteria, as per the applicable rules. Failure to consider an employee for promotion even after satisfying the eligibility criteria would violate her fundamental right. However, a clear distinction has been drawn between the stage of considering an employee for being promoted to taking the next step of recognizing the said right as a vested right for promotion. That is where the line has to be drawn. Stated differently, a right to be considered for promotion being a facet of the right to equal opportunity in employment and appointment, would have to be treated as a fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution of India but such a right cannot translate into a vested right of the employee for being necessarily promoted to the promotional post, unless the rules expressly provide for such a situation. 22 (1998) 4 SCC 456 776 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 23. The view that seniority can neither be reckoned from the date when a vacancy arises, nor can it be granted retrospectively unless the service rules specifically provide for such a situation, is fortified by the decision of this Court in K.K. Vadera 14 (supra) which has emphasised in no uncertain terms the settled position in law that promotion to a post should only be granted from the date of the promotion and not from the date on which a vacancy may have arisen.
