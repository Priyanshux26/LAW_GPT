[Para 19] Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – s. 2(7) – Definition of consumer – Deconstruction of s. 2(7)(i): Held: There are three parts to the definition of a consumer – First part sets out the prerequisites for a person to qualify as a consumer- there must be purchase of goods, for consideration – Second part is an ‘exclusion clause’ [‘carve out’] which has the effect of excluding the person from the definition of a consumer – The carve out applies if the person has obtained goods for the purpose of ‘resale’ or for a ‘commercial purpose’ – Third part is an exception to the exclusion clause, it relates to explanation (a) to s. 2(7) which limits the scope of ‘commercial purpose’, the expression, ‘commercial purpose’ does not include persons who bought goods ‘exclusively for the purpose of earning his livelihood, by means of self-employment’ – Significance of deconstructing the definition into three parts was for the purpose of explaining on whom lies the onus to prove each of the different parts – Onus of proving the first part-person had bought goods/availed services for a consideration, rests on the complainant himself – Carve out clause, in the second part, is invoked by the service providers to exclude the complainants from availing benefits under the Act – Onus of proving that the person 216 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports falls within the carve out must necessarily rest on the service provider and not the complainant – Since it is always the service provider who pleads that the service was obtained for a commercial purpose, the onus of proving the same would have to be borne by it – Act is a consumer-friendly and beneficial legislation intended to address grievances of consumers – Negative burden cannot be placed on the complainant to show that the service available was not for a commercial purpose.
