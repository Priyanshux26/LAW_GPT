Rajagopalan was the director of International Aviation Academy Private Limited, and as seen from the audited financial statements of the said company, from 2010-2011 to 2017-2018, a sum of Rs. 12,03,000/- was collected by the G said company as ‘share application money pending allotment’. The Appellate Tribunal further noticed that the said sum was not refunded and as such, was to be treated as ‘deposit’ in terms of Explanation (a) to Rule 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Companies (Acceptance of Deposits) Rules, 2014 as a consequence of which, in terms of Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act, the resolution applicant stood disqualified from acting H 828 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A as a director in any company for a period of five years from the date on which the said International Aviation Academy Private Limited failed to repay the deposit amount. Some of the relevant observations and the findings of the Appellate Tribunal in this regard could be noticed in the following extraction: - B “117. The learned Senior Counsel for the 2nd respondent has vehemently argued that the objection raised by the appellant was never raised before the Adjudicating Authority. In response to this objection, Learned Counsel for the appellant submits no estoppel against a statute. Section 61 (3) empowers the Appellate Tribunal to question irregularities and illegalities in the CIRP, C including the Resolution Plan. The Resolution Plan being in rem, these questions fall within the exclusive purview of judicial review. These grounds cannot be eschewed from consideration on the simple ground that they were never raised before NCLT, as persons who were not before NCLT are also before this court. D 118. The Ld Senior counsel for the Appellants, in response to the above submissions of Respondent No.2, regarding the disqualification of the 2nd Respondent, argued that the 2nd Respondent is a Director of M/s. International Aviation Academy Private Limited, and it is seen from the audited financial statements E of the said Company for the period 2010-2011 to 2017-2018 that a sum of Rs.12,03,000/- has been collected as ‘share application money pending allotment’. 119. It appears that the said sum has not been refunded, and as such, the same shall be treated as ‘deposit’ in terms of Explanation (a) of Rule 2(1)(c)(vii) of The Companies (Acceptance of F Deposits) Rules, 2014. In the above circumstances, given Section 164 (2) (b) of the Companies Act, the 2nd Respondent has been disqualified from acting as a Director in any Company for five years from the date on which the said Ms International Aviation Academy Private Limited failed to repay the deposit amounts G collected towards ‘share application money pending allotment’ aggregating to Rs.12,03,000/. 120. Even assuming these amounts have been repaid during 2018- 2019, the 2nd Respondent is disqualified from acting as a director to date. Thus, the 2nd Respondent is not eligible to act as a H M. K. RAJAGOPALAN v. DR. PERIASAMY PALANI 829 GOUNDER & ANR. [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] resolution applicant as per Section 29-A(e) of the Code.
