Under the Code of 1882 the Magistrate of the District where the husband or father, as the case may be, resided only had jurisdiction.” The court then emphasized that the term “is” was fact dependent, and had to be read contextually: “The purpose of the statute would be better served if the word “resides” was understood to include temporary residence. The juxtaposition of the words “is” and “last resided” in the sub-Section also throws light on the meaning of the word “resides”. The word “is”, as we shall explain later, confers jurisdiction on a Court on the basis of a casual visit and the expression “last resided”, about which also we 37 Notifi cation No. 28/2012 [F. No. 503/02/1997-FTD-1]/S.O. 1693(E), dated 25-7-2012 38 (1964) 2 SCR 73 117 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. have something to say, indicates that the Legislature could not have intended to use the word “resides” in the technical sense of domicile. The word “resides” cannot be given a meaning diff erent from the word “resided” in the expression “last resided” and, therefore, the wider meaning fi ts in the setting in which the word “resides” appears.” In P. Anand Gajapati Raju v. P.V.G Raju39 in the context of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, this court explained that “is” normally has present signifi cation: “the phrase which is the subject of an arbitration agreement does not, in the context, necessarily require that the agreement must be already in existence before the action is brought in the Court. The phrase also connotes an arbitration agreement being brought into existence while the action is pending. Blacks Law Dictionary has defi ned the word is as follows: “This word, although normally referring to the present, often has a future meaning, but is not synonymous with shall have been. It may have, however, a past signifi cation, as in the sense of has been.” Again, in Vijay Kumar Prasad v. State of Bihar40 this court reiterated the same view, that “is” refers to the present: “Although the expression normally refers to the present, often it has a future meaning. It may also have a past signifi cation as in the sense of “has been”. (See F.S. Gandhi v. CWT [(1990) 3 SCC 624 : 1990 SCC (Tax) 364 : AIR 1991 SC 1866] .) The true intention has to be contextually culled out.” 51. From the above discussion, it is clear that the expression “is” has a present signifi cation and it derives meaning from the context. Given this interpretation, the conclusion is that when a third-party country enters into DTAA with India, it should be a member of OECD, for the earlier treaty benefi ciary to claim parity. 39 (2000) 4 SCC 539 40 (2004) 5 SCC 196 ASSESSING OFFICER CIRCLE (INTERNATIONAL TAXATION) 2(2)(2) 1177 NEW DELHI v.
