This Court could only reject such an attempt on the part of the Revenue as a hair- splitting exercise, away and detached from the substance. This is apart from the fact that the specification of medicament C under Heading 3004 would, in any case, cover the product in question in the form it is marketed for retail sale. [Para 32][352- E-G] 3.4 By way of the amendment of 2012, even if the relevant entries pertaining to preparation for use on the hair have been D provided with micro classifications in comparison to the entries standing earlier (as could be seen from the entries, it could never be taken to mean that anything which is prepared for being used on the hair and carries the name “Hair Oil”, would lose its character as medicament if otherwise it has been prepared for E therapeutic or prophylactic uses. Moreover, rewording and regrouping of different entries in medicaments are hardly of any impact on the character of the product in question. [Para 32.1][352- G-H; 353-A-B] 3.5 Chapter 30, apart from Heading 3003 relating to F medicaments consisting of two or more constituents which have been mixed together for therapeutic or prophylactic uses not put up in measured doses or in forms or packing for retail sale, Heading 3004 pertains to the medicaments consisting of mixed or un-mixed product for therapeutic or prophylactic uses put up in measured doses or in form of packing for retail sale. Viewed G thus, the submissions that even with reference to its packaging, the product AHAHO would remain a homeopathic medicament and would be covered under Chapter 30, where it could be placed in Sub-Heading 3004 90 14 is accepted. Similarly, deletions of the reference to the Act of 1940 or to various pharmacopoeia H 290 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A cannot be interpreted to mean that a product like the one in question, which is otherwise a medicament, has to be classified on the basis of the base through which the application of medicine is being provided. [Para 32.2][353-B-E] 3.6 Application of the relevant principles, the product B AHAHO, comes clean through the twin test. Therefore, there had been no justification for making any attempt to re-classify the product in question with reference to the amendments brought about in Chapters 30 and 33 in the year 2012.
