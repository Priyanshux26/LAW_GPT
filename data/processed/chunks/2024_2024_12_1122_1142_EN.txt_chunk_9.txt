Having noticed the obligations under international law to protect women as above, we now turn to the main basis on which the two female victims were harassed and grievously assaulted. 21. Witchcraft, of which one of the victims stands accused, is certainly one such practice which should be shunned. Such allegations have a long past often with tragic consequences for those subjected to them. Witchcraft is deeply intertwined with superstition, patriarchy and social control, leaving it to no manner of surprise that such allegations were most often directed against women who were either widows or elderly. A variety of reasons are accepted to be the reasons for casting such aspersions- caste-based discrimination, retaliation for defying social norms, etc. The effect thereof is overwhelmingly negative, leading to barbaric treatment, public humiliation and sometimes even death.14 Yearly report as per NCRB15 Witchcraft 354-B IPC 2019 102 11238 2020 88 10580 2021 68 11102 2022 85 9101 14 See generally, Alam and Raj, (2021) The Academic Journey of Witchcraft Studies in India, Man in India Vol.97 Issue 21 15 2019-https://www.ncrb.gov.in/uploads/nationalcrimerecordsbureau/custom/1653730573_CII%20 2019%20Volume%201.pdf 2020- https://www.ncrb.gov.in/uploads/nationalcrimerecordsbureau/post/16959885631653645869CII20 20Volume1.pdf 2021-https://www.ncrb.gov.in/uploads/nationalcrimerecordsbureau/custom/1696831798CII2021 Volume1.pdf 2022- https://www.ncrb.gov.in/uploads/nationalcrimerecordsbureau/custom/1701607577CrimeinIndia20 22Book1.pdf [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1137 Rajeev Kumar Upadhyay v. Srikant Upadhyay & Ors. 22. Although the numbers referred to above may seem insignificant, however, even 102 or 85, whatever the number may be, of reported inhumane, degrading incidents, each of them is a blot on the constitutional spirit. Those many persons were targeted and possibly exploited and abused on the basis of superstitions, conjecture and entirely unfounded beliefs which go against the scientific temper that each and every citizen of India called upon to foster within oneself and also within their own communities. The other number presented, i.e. the number of incidents reported under Section 354-B IPC, is deeply anguishing. In Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Subhra Chakraborty16 the Court made the following observations in the context of the offence under Section 375 IPC: “10. Rape is thus not only a crime against the person of a woman (victim), it is a crime against the entire society. It destroys the entire psychology of a woman and pushes her into deep emotional crisis. It is only by her sheer will- power that she rehabilitates herself in the society which, on coming to know of the rape, looks down upon her in derision and contempt. Rape is, therefore, the most hated crime. It is a crime against basic human rights and is also violative of the victim›s most cherished of the Fundamental Rights, namely, the Right to Life contained in Article 21. To many feminists and psychiatrists, rape is less a sexual offence than an act of aggression aimed at degrading and humiliating women. The rape laws do not, unfortunately, take care of the social aspect of the matter and are inept in many respects.” 23. We may say that the offence of disrobing would also qualify as having a similar effect on the psychology of the woman subjected to such deep humiliation. 24. Turning our attention back to witchcraft, the seriousness and drastic ill effects of such accusations and what follows thereafter have been noticed at the World stage.
