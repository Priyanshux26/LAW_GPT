29. The appellants have already deposited a sum of Rs.1 crore towards the amount made payable by them. The sum amount will be C subject to the final adjudication by the Assistant Stamp Collector. If the Assistant Stamp Collector comes to the conclusion that the market value of the land and structures is lesser than what was determined earlier by the Assistant Stamp Collector, the appellants will be entitled to a refund of the excess amount paid with interest at the rate of 8% per annum D from the date on which the amount was paid till the date on which the refund is made. If it is found that the deficit stamp duty exceeds Rs.1 crore, the appellants will have to make good the said amount. Sub-section 4A of Section 47A is in mandatory terms. The use of the word ‘shall’ make it clear that the Collector has no choice but to impose interest at the rate of 1.5% per month on the deficit amount. We are not disturbing E the of the High Court insofar as it relates to penalty as the State Government has not challenged that part. 30.Hence, we set aside the impugned of the High Court as well as the of the Assistant Stamp Collector and the Appellate Authority and remand the case for fresh consideration to the Assistant F Stamp Collector. However, we confirm that part of the impugned of the High Court, by which it was held that the appellants are not liable to pay penalty. The Assistant Stamp Collector shall permit the appellants to lead evidence on the issue of valuation. The Assistant Stamp Collector is directed to conclude the proceedings as early as possible and preferably G within a period of six months from today. 31.The appeal is, accordingly, allowed on the above terms with no as to costs.
