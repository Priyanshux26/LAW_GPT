The ITAT dismissed the Appeals filed by the Revenue and the appellant. The cross-objection came to be disposed of. This is dated 11.01.2002. 12. For the Assessment Year 1996-1997, the ITAT disposed of the Appeal filed by the Revenue and also the cross-objection filed against the dated 18.12.2000. The Appeal filed by the Revenue [ITA 240 H M/s. D. N. SINGH v. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, 545 CENTRAL, PATNA AND ANOTHER [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] (Patna/2001)] was allowed. The Tribunal finds that the appellant had A not disputed the lifting of the bitumen. The claim made by the appellant that full supply was made, stood demolished, when photocopies of delivery challans were found to be false and fabricated. The Executive Engineers, it was further found, had confirmed non-delivery to the tune of 2090.40 metric tonnes. The Commissioner Appeals, it was found, reached a wrong B conclusion, as he did not address himself to the explanation offered by the Junior Engineers. It was found that all Executive Engineers of the Consignee Divisions presented a case of non-delivery before the Assessing Officer. Thus, on the same day, i.e., on 11.01.2002, the ITAT allowed the Appeal filed by the Revenue and sustained the of the Assessing Officer relating to addition on account of short supply of C bitumen for the Assessment Year 1996-1997, whereas, for the Assessment Year 1995-1996, taking note of the of the Commissioner Appeals, passed under Section 154 of the Act, by which, the matter stood remitted back, the Appeal of the Revenue and the Appeal of the appellant, challenging the Rectification , came to be D dismissed. 13. This, in turn, triggered the Appeal, i.e., M.A. 214 of 2002 before the High Court by the appellant under Section 260A of the Act. The High Court, inter alia, refers to the appellant filing Return for the Assessment Year 1996-1997, disclosing total income of Rs.576133/-. E 14. Reference is made to the addition of Rs.1,04,72,720.30 on the basis of short supply of bitumen. After referring to the submissions, the court focussed on the scope of Section 69A of the Act. The High Court found that the word ‘owner’ has different meaning in different contexts and when a transporter sells the goods and receives money for that not F on behalf of the real owner, it became the owner for the purpose of tax. Having lifted bitumen and not supplied to the Road Construction Department to which it was to be supplied, the appellant would be liable to pay tax on the bitumen lifted and not delivered. The High Court distinguished the in Dhirajlal Haridas v. Commissioner of Income Tax (Central), Bombay1 by noting that for determining the person G liable to pay tax, the test laid down by this Court was to find out the person entitled to that income. The Court also went on to distinguish the in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Amrit lal Chunilal2 It 1 (1982) 138 ITR 570 2 (1984) 40 CTR Bombay 387. H 546 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R.
