13. As noticed hereinbefore, the appellants herein moved the application for anticipatory bail in connection with FIR No.79 of 2020 registered at Govindgunj Police Station. It is a fact that the subject FIR was registered pursuant to the directions of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, East Champaran, Motihari on complaint No.395 of 2020 filed by Respondent No.4 under Section 156 (3), Cr. PC. The allegations in the complaint are as follows: - On 22.02.2020, at about 8.00 am, when Jagmati Kunwar, the grandmother of respondent No.4 reached in front of the house of appellant No.2, Shashikant Upadhyay, he said that she is the witch who made his child sick and shall not be spared. Then, the appellants and eight other family members gathered around her and the 4th appellant caught hold of her hair and asked the others to bring dung. Thereupon, accused Paritosh Kumar brought dung and accused Rishu put dung into the mouth of Jagmati Kunwar. Consequently, she vomited and fell down. When respondent No.2/ complainant and other witnesses went for her help, the second appellant Shashikant Upadhayay assaulted and abused respondent No.2. Co-accused Paritosh Kumar and Jishu Kumar tore the blouse of Kiran Devi and she was disrobed. Another co-accused Soni Devi snatched a gold chain from the complainant. The co-accused Ravikant and appellant No.5 tore the clothes of Jagmati Kunwar and made her half-naked. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 429 Srikant Upadhyay & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Anr. 14. Later, after completing the investigation, charge sheet was filed on 08.08.2022 only for offences under Sections 341, 323 and 504 IPC, that too only against accused Lakhpati Kunwar (accused No.7). However, the learned Trial Court, on perusal of the FIR, charge sheet and case diary found that sufficient materials are available in the case diary to proceed against the other 12 accused, including the appellants herein and accordingly vide dated 20.02.2021 took cognizance of the offences under Sections 341, 323, 354B, IPC and Section 3/4 of the Daain Act and issued summons to all accused including the appellants and fixed 12.04.2022 as the date for their appearance. The accused were absent on that day and hence on 12.04.2022, the Trial Court issued bailable warrants. On 25.05.2022, the accused, other than the appellants herein, appeared and applied for regular bail before the Trial Court and the Trial Court granted them regular bail. Subsequently, the complainant/the second respondent herein, applied for cancellation of bail granted to them and as per the dated 09.06.2022 the grantees of bail were issued with show cause notices. Upon receiving the notice for cancellation of bail, they unsuccessfully approached the Sessions Court challenging the taking cognizance, in Criminal Revision Petition No.94 of 2022. Pursuant to the dismissal of the Revision Petition, the Trial Court posted the application for cancellation of bail on different dates. The fact is that despite such developments, the appellants herein neither appeared before the Trial Court nor sought for regular bail. In the meanwhile, the appellants herein moved a bail-cum-surrender application (described as such by them), before the Trial Court.
