Collector of Central Excise (2004) 12 SCC 70 DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS 137. We have heard the learned advocates appearing for the parties and perused the records. At the outset, we would like to make it explicitly clear that the tribunal though has relied upon the of Urmin and Flakes-n-fl avourz, apart from assigning other reasons, in the facts and 654 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. circumstances obtained in the present case, we have proceeded to examine the rival contentions, notwithstanding the fi ndings recorded by the tribunal in Urmin Products and Flakes-n-fl avourz which are the subject matter of Civil Appeal No.10159-161 of 2010 and Civil Appeal No.5146 of 2015, which has been adjudicated by us under this common itself by assigning separate and independent reasons and the facts of the said case are distinguished from the facts of the present case. This view also gets fortifi ed by the very fact that in the instant case, an inquiry was conducted in respect of assessee’s product and the superintendent in-charge of the respondent’s factory furnished the reports to the Deputy Commissioner on 04.03.2015 after visiting the factory of the assessee, inspected the machines and the product manufactured, since the assessee had declared in Form 1 to the eff ect that the product manufactured by it is ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’. In the said report the superintendent has opined as under: “As regards the assessee’s letter dated 02.03.2015 regarding amendment in their Registration by changing the CETSH of their fi nal product form 24039910 (Chewing Tobacco) to 24039930 (Jarda Scented Tobacco), it is submitted that looking to the production process/ingredients the product is already correctly classifi ed under CETSH 24039910 and does not merit classifi cation under the CETSH 24039930, as claimed by the assessee.” 138. Thus, it is clear that the stand of the assessee has been consistent to the eff ect that product manufactured by it is to be classifi ed as ‘zarda/ jarda scented tobacco’ and at the insistence of the jurisdictional Deputy Commissioner the assessee was classifying the goods under CET SH 2403 9910 i.e., ‘chewing tobacco’, for which there was also an of determination passed under Rule 6(2) of CTPM rules. Whereas in the other matters, namely Urmin and Flakes-n-Flavourz, the facts were entirely diff erent. In Urmin Products the assessee had declared the product as ‘chewing tobacco’ and then changed the classifi cation to ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ and again came back to the original position of declaring it or classifying it as ‘chewing tobacco’.
