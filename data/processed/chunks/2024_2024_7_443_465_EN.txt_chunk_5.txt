yd. 8. Seeking further enhancement, a few landowners approached this Court, but their Special Leave Petitions (SLPs) were dismissed on 05.02.2014. However, in Civil Appeal Nos. 18620-18623 / 2017 titled Bir Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh, this Court vide judgement dated 09.11.2017, further enhanced the compensation to INR 449 per sq. yd., relying on a sale exemplar dated 16.12.1988 for a land situated in Village Chhalera Bangar, and noting that the sale price of the said land was INR 400 per sq. yd. The Review and Curative Petitions preferred by the State / NOIDA authorities against this were dismissed on 06.03.2018 and 13.03.2019, respectively. Consequently, all the First Appeals pending before the High Court, pertaining to the same acquisition came to be allowed in line with Bir Singh (supra), and compensation was accordingly enhanced to INR 449 per sq. yd. 9. It is in this backdrop that a majority of the cases before us mount a challenge to those High Court s which were pronounced before Bir Singh (supra) and wherein the High Court had granted compensation at INR 340 per sq. yd. only. The landowners thus seek parity with Bir Singh (supra) and the resultant enhancement of their compensation to INR 449 per sq. yd. On the other hand, NOIDA has also filed multiple appeals challenging the High Court judgements that were decided on the anvil of Bir Singh (supra). The landowners too have filed several Miscellaneous Applications against the earlier dismissal of their SLPs, seeking recall of the previous s and to restore parity with Bir Singh (supra). Additionally, two of the SLPs included in the batch of cases before us assail an of the High Court dismissing the landowners’ Review Petitions and rejecting their enhancement claim on account of delay in filing the review before the High Court. 10. The matters pending before us, therefore, can be categorized into two groups: i. SLPs, Miscellaneous Applications and Civil Appeals preferred by landowners who had already been granted compensation at INR 340 per sq. yd. and who are now seeking parity with Bir Singh (supra) where compensation was enhanced to INR 449 per sq. yd. ; and [2024] 7 S.C.R. 451 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. Harnand Singh (Deceased) through LRs & Ors. ii. Civil Appeals preferred by NOIDA as against the enhanced compensation of INR 449 per sq. yd. granted to some of the landowners. B. Contentions on behalf of the State 11. We have heard learned Senior Counsels for the parties at considerable length and have perused the record at length. 12. Mr. Ravinder Kumar, learned Senior Counsel representing NOIDA, argued that Bir Singh (supra) had based its finding on an erroneous reading of a sale exemplar, wherein this Court read a description of the extent of land being 400 sq. yds. as the value of the land instead, i.e., INR 400 per sq. yd. He submitted that the Reference Court had read the figure correctly and granted compensation at INR 110 per sq. yd.
