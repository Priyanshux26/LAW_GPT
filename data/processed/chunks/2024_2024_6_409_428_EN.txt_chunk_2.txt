By the impugned dated 09.08.2023, passed in Crl. O.P. Nos.14029 & 14031 of 2023 and Crl. M.P. Nos.8658 of 2023, the High Court of Madras has allowed the claim of the Respondents-accused for de-freezing of their bank accounts. The High Court has ed for de-freezing on the specific ground that there was delay on part of the police in reporting the seizure to [2024] 6 S.C.R. 413 Shento Varghese v. Julfikar Husen & Ors. the jurisdictional Magistrate. The facts in the instant case, which we shall advert to later below, have given rise to following question of law: What is the implication of non-reporting of the seizure forthwith to the jurisdictional Magistrate as provided under Section 102(3) Cr.P.C.? more specifically; Does delayed reporting of the seizure to the Magistrate vitiate the seizure altogether? That is the question which needs to be answered in these appeals. 3. Our research indicates that there is no authoritative pronouncement of this Court on this issue. If we turn to the pronouncements of the High Courts, there are decisions1 which have directly confronted this question. Having reviewed these decisions, we find that, broadly, there are two prevailing strands of thought: one set of cases holding that delayed reporting to the Magistrate would, ipso facto, vitiate the seizure ; and the other view being that delayed reporting would constitute a mere irregularity and would not vitiate the seizure . 4. The former view has been justified on the grounds that: (a) the obligation [u/S 102(3) Cr.P.C.] to report the seizure forthwith to the Magistrate is mandatory and non-negotiable, breach of which would qualify as an illegality in following the prescribed statutory procedure2; (b) the employment of the word ‘shall’ in Section 102(3) makes it clear that non-compliance of the mandatory requirement to report forthwith to the Magistrate goes to the root of the matter3; (c) the power to seize has been subjected to procedural requirements prescribed under Section 102(3) – 1 See Table at Annexure A for a compilation of the 36 decisions on this issue.
