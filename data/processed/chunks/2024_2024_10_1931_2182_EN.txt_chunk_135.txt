2117 State of U.P. & Ors. v. M/s Lalta Prasad Vaish and sons has the greatest claim to be construed ut res magis valeat quam pereat.” 12.3 The learned Chief Justice Dr. Chandrachud, in his opinion has conducted an extensive inquiry into identification of legislative meaning of the phrase and its legislative history, but found that no conclusive answer can be reached on the legal import of “intoxicating liquors”. With due respect, I view that such an enquiry needs to give due primacy to the ordinary and natural meaning of words and also test their connotations in colloquial use by the Constitution makers so as to give it a constitutional flavour. A Historical Perspective: 12.4 A historical enquiry would show that “intoxicating liquors” was first used in Entry 31 – List II in the Government of India Act, 1935. This was a departure from the legislative head in Devolution Rules framed under the Government of India Act, 1919 insofar as the Entry therein was “alcoholic liquor”. The revisions in List II of Government of India Act, 1935 were partly the product of a Joint Select Committee chaired by Lord Linlithgow. Later, the word “liquors” was also qualified by the word “intoxicating”. 12.5 I may briefly refer to the following remarks of Brewer, J. in South Carolina vs. United States (1905) 199 US 437 (“South Carolina”): “To determine the extent of the grants of power, we must, therefore, place ourselves in the position of the men who framed and adopted the Constitution, and inquire what they must have understood to be the meaning and scope of those grants.” 12.6 In this backdrop, it is useful to draw sustenance from certain contemporaneous legislations and Hansard records that go to show that the phrase “intoxicating liquors” was used in the context of consumption. On 30.04.1889, the House of Commons on a motion moved by Mr. S. Smith to discuss how the fiscal system of the Government of India led to the establishment of spirit distilleries, liquor and opium shops in a large number of places where till recently (from the date of question) they 2118 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports never existed had several references to “intoxicating liquors” exclusively in the context of consumption. On 29.06.1904, Mr. Herbert Roberts, a person interested in temperance asked the Secretary of State for India whether he was aware that the number of ‘shops open for the sale of “intoxicating liquors” and drugs in India rose from 97,910 in 1901–02 to 99,497 in 1902–03’ and whether he was in a position to explain the reasons for this increase in the number of shops opened and the consequent increase in consumption. Most interestingly, on 13.07.1937, in a sitting of the House of Lords, Lord Clwyd (formerly Mr. Herbert Roberts) asked the Secretary of State for India the following question: “To ask His Majesty’s Government what was the amount in pounds sterling of the net Excise revenue of India for the years 1933–1934, 1934–1935 and 1935–1936 respectively; what was the recorded consumption of country spirits in 1935–1936 in Bengal, Madras, Bombay, Sind, Bihar and Orissa, the United Provinces, the Punjab, the North-West Frontier Province, the Central Provinces and Berar, Assam and Burma respectively; what was the number of shops licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor, the net amount of Excise revenue, and the cost of Excise administration in each Province in 1930–1931 and 1935–1936; and what was the percentage of Excise revenue compared with the total revenue accruing to the Provincial Governments in each case for the year 1935–1936.” 12.7 This enquiry reflects that “intoxicating liquors” has not only been a term of common parlance but was also used in administration for assessment and regulation of consumption of spirits in provinces in pre-independence India from the point of view of collection of revenue.
