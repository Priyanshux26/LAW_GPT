It was urged that the tribunal adopted the same interpretation 13 ITA No. 7315/Mum/2018 14 ITA No. 3336/Del/2018 ASSESSING OFFICER CIRCLE (INTERNATIONAL TAXATION) 2(2)(2) 1157 NEW DELHI v. M/S NESTLE SA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] as was done in the impugned. It was submitted also, that the Karnataka High Court in Apollo Tyres Ltd. (supra) had similarly considered the same Protocol to the India-Netherlands DTAA; which as the revenue did not challenge - had, attained fi nality. 24. The assessees refute the revenue’s argument that treaties with other OECD countries did not have a triggering consequence of the MFN clauses with the three countries in the present case. On the revenue’s reference to the unilateral notifi cation dated 30.08.1999, where the restricted scope of FTS is only given by India w.e.f. 01.04.1997, whereas the limited scope of FTS was agreed in the India-USA DTAA which came into force from 18.12.1990 - it is urged that this notifi cation is unilateral and not a bilateral amendment by both states. The assessees highlight, in this regard that the notifi cation nowhere clarifi es that both states had agreed to its contents. In contrast Notifi cation No. GSR 382(E)/ Notifi cation No.2/2013 dated 14.1.2013 which notifi ed the Protocol to India-Netherlands dated 10.5.2012 bilaterally amending the DTAA and states “India and Netherlands... Desiring to conclude a Protocol (hereinafter referred to as “Amending Protocol”) to amend the Convention....have agreed as follows” 25. It is submitted that every bilateral amendment to treaty always has a date of entry into force agreed by both states. But the said Notifi cation dated 30.08.1999 does not have one. Contrast this with the 2012 bilateral amendment made in the India-Netherlands DTAA by the Protocol which entered into force on 02.11.2012 and was notifi ed vide Notifi cation No. 2/2013. 26. The purpose of this unilateral notifi cation by India is clear from the Dutch communication dated 18.11.1999 which states that messages were exchanged and there was a diff erence of understanding between Indian and Dutch authorities on the limited aspect as to whether the MFN clause would be applicable from the date of entry into force of the benefi cial DTAA, or w.e.f. 1st April of the following fi scal year, since India follows the fi nancial year (April-March) pattern. This limited aspect was agreed by the Dutch authorities. It is argued that no such reservation was noted by India for MFN in clause IV of Protocol. 115 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 27. Counsel submit that the absence of a unilateral notifi cation which may have in the past been issued as an administrative practice cannot override the clear language of an MFN clause which provides for automatic application. The assessees refer to Union of India of India v. Agricas LLP15, which held that the State cannot breach a treaty to which it is a party by referring to domestic law-be it legislative, executive, or judicial decision. The decision in Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence P. Ltd. v. CIT16 applied the principle in Director of Income Tax v New Skies Satellite BV17 wherein the Delhi High Court held that mere executive position cannot alter the law under the DTAA.
