13. The rest of the reply deals with the details and interpretation of the clauses of the agreements. 14. On having heard learned counsel for the parties, we are of the view that the nature of jurisdiction exercised by this Court is predicated on two specialist authorities/tribunals having applied their mind to it. It would be diffi cult to have a re-appreciation of evidence and facts, especially when the admitted position is that the TDSAT has not opined on it. It would thus not be appropriate to venture into this aspect. However, this letter being in the nature of an internal communication privy to the non-applicants, we believe it should have been placed before the concerned authorities. Whether it has any impact or not, it would be diffi cult for us to say at this stage until the opinion of the TDSAT is available. 15. We are, thus, inclined to adopt the alternative prayer of the applicants by directing that the effect of this document ought to be examined by the TDSAT. We leave it to the TDSAT to take a view on the same, uninfl uenced by the fact that the earlier opinion of the TDSAT has DELHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT LTD. v. AIRPORTS ECONOMIC 807 REGULATORY AUTHORITY & ORS. [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] received our imprimatur. Thus, the TDSAT may for the limited issue qua computation of HRAB examine the eff ect of the letter now produced before us, i.e., the letter dated 24.05.2011 by the MoCA to the AERA, and take its own independent view on the impact of the same in computing HRAB and whether ‘single till’ mechanism should be the basis of the computation. Needless to say, that in either situation the eff ected parties would have a remedy before this Court. 16. We dispose of the applications in the aforesaid terms.
