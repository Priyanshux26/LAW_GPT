11. Shri Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel appearing for the contesting respondents submitted that a plea of nullity can be taken at any stage. As held in Ramesh Gobindram (Supra), Sections 6 and 7 of the Act 43 of 1995 do not confer the requisite jurisdiction on the Wakf Tribunal in deciding an issue qua an eviction of an individual from a Wakf property.

Kerala State Wakf Board & Anr., (2023) SCC OnLine SC 519 : 2023 (7) SCALE 130. 13. Before dwelling into the merits of this case, we shall fi rst go into the issues of law governing the submissions made. EXECUTING COURT CANNOT GO BEYOND THE DECREE 14. The legal principle that an Executing Court cannot go beyond the decree stands fortifi ed, subject to the rigor of Section 47 read with XXI of the Code. As a matter of course, an Executing Court is enjoined with the duty to give eff ect to the decree. Any interference, including on a question involving jurisdiction, should be undertaken very sparsely as a matter of exception. The onus lies heavily on the -debtor to convince the Court that a decree is inexecutable. When an exercise is likely to involve a factual adjudication, it should better be avoided. 15. The conduct of a party assumes signifi cance. If a party is likely to have an undue advantage, despite the availability of an opportunity to raise a plea of lack of jurisdiction at an earlier point of time, it should not be permitted to do so during the execution proceedings.
