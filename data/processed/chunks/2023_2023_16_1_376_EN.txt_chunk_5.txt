[Para 514] – Held (per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.) (Concurring with Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, CJI): The challenge to Section 4 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act on the touchstone of Article 3 is not required to be debated on account of the assurance on behalf of the Government of India that the Statehood of Jammu & Kashmir would be restored on elections being held – It is imperative to ascertain the ‘views’ of the State Legislature under the fi rst proviso to Article 3 if the proposed Bill aff ects the area, boundaries or name of the State – However, in the instant case since the State of Jammu & Kashmir was under President’s Rule and the State Legislature was already dissolved, the functions of the State Legislature were performed by the Union Parliament – Hence, it was not possible to ascertain the views of the State IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 9 Legislature – It follows that Section 3 of the Reorganization Act is valid. [Para 112] – Held (per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) (Concurring with Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, CJI): Union Territories are normally geographically small territories, or may be created for aberrant reasons or causes – Conversion of a State into Union Territory has grave consequences, amongst others, it denies the citizens of the State an elected state government and impinges on federalism – Conversion/creation of a Union Territory from a State has to be justifi ed by giving very strong and cogent grounds – It must be in strict compliance with Article 3 of the Constitution of India. [Para 6] Human Rights – Jammu and Kashmir – Held Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J, Recommendation made by for setting up of an impartial truth and reconciliation Commission to investigate and report on violation of human rights both by State and non-State actors in Jammu & Kashmir at least since the 1980s and recommend measures for reconciliation.
