He was impleaded only on 02.01.2001. 8. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents No. 1 to 3/ plaintiffs submitted that the entire effort of the appellants is just to deprive respondents No. 1 to 3 of their rightful share in the family property. The partition of 1965 was rightly relied upon by the High Court as against the partition of 1984, the genuineness of which is quite doubtful. In fact, all the family members had connived to deny rightful claim of the plaintiffs. It was further submitted that the [2024] 3 S.C.R. 53 Srinivas Raghavendrarao Desai (Dead) By Lrs. v. V. Kumar Vamanrao @ Alok and Ors. sale deed which was executed by the appellant-defendant No. 7 in favour of defendant No. 9 in violation of the interim passed by the Trial Court is non-est and deserves to be ignored. In support, reliance was placed upon the s of this Court in Jehal Tanti and others v. Nageshwar Singh (dead) through LRs,7 and Ghanshyam Sarda v. Sashikant Jha, Director, M/s J. K. Jute Mills Company Limoited and others8. He further argued that once the parties go to trial knowing the issues involved, the evidence led even without pleadings can very well be appreciated. In support, reliance was placed upon the of this Court in Bhagwati Prasad v. Chandramaul9. 8.1 The property bearing Regular Survey No. 106/2 was sold by defendant No. 7 to defendant No. 9 to protect his interest. Even though the sale was held to be bad by the High Court, no appeal has been preferred by defendant No. 9. Only defendant No. 7 has challenged the same. No doubt, the application for amendment of plaint to raise the pleading regarding 1965 partition was rejected, however, the High Court had made observations that defendant No. 7 is entitled to argue on the basis of the pleadings and documentary evidence to vindicate his right and also that the Trial Court is not barred to mould the relief and allot shares in accordance with law in a suit of partition. 8.2 Learned counsel for defendant No. 9 adopted the arguments which were raised by learned counsel for the appellants as their interest is common and he is the bonafide purchaser of the property, which is a public institution, from defendant No. 7 on payment of consideration. 9. In response to the submissions made by learned counsel for respondents No. 1 to 3, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the stand taken by defendant No. 1 before the High Court was a clear somersault as his counsel sought to argue relying upon the proceedings before the Land Tribunal which was not even his pleaded case before the Trial Court. The sale deed was executed 7 2013(14) SCC 689 8 (2017) 1 SCC 599 9 AIR 1966 SC 735 54 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports by defendant No. 7 on 25.07.2001. The same was well within the knowledge of defendant No. 1, however, he did not challenge the same during his life time, in case there was any error committed by defendant No.7.
