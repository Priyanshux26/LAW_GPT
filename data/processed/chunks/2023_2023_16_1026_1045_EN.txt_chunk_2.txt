THE GENESIS OF THE DISPUTE 3. The grievance of the Respondent is that upon superannuation of the previous JAG (Air), despite meeting the criteria for promotion to AVM, no promotion board was formed to consider the Respondent for the aforesaid vacancy and instead, it was eventually decided that he would be considered for promotion in his parent branch along with his course mates in Promotion Board 1/2015. 4. As such,he was considered in the said Promotion Board along with 9 other persons. Other persons, apart from him were found eligible to fi ll up the position of JAG (Air) since no other persons, apart from the Appellant were found to have the requisite legal training in accordance with the AFI 71/74. Hence, he was recommended for the position of AVM, which however, was not accepted by the Ministry of Defence6. 5. It is on such non-acceptance of the recommendation of the Promotion Board that, the dispute before us, began. STATUTORY APPEAL 6.
