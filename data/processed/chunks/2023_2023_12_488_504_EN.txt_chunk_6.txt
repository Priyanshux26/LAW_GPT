15. In Kichha Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Roofrite (P) Ltd18 it was observed: “4. Our attention is drawn by the learned counsel for the respondents to the provisions of Section 100(5) of the Civil Procedure Code where the respondent to a second appeal is permitted “to argue that the case does not involve such question” i.e. the questions formulated earlier. No doubt, but then the on the second appeal should indicate, howsoever briefl y, why the questions formulated at the earlier stage had, at the stage of fi nal hearing, been found to be no questions of law.” 16. Substantial questions should ordinarily, not be framed at a later stage. If done so, then parties must be given an opportunity to meet them. This Court in U.R. Virupakshappa v. Sarvamangala19held : “15. … It, furthermore, should not ordinarily frame a substantial question of law at a subsequent stage without assigning any reason therefor and without giving a reasonable opportunity of hearing to the respondents. [See Nune Prasad v. Nune Ramakrishna [(2008) 8 SCC 258 : (2008) 10 Scale 523] ; Panchugopal Barua v. Umesh Chandra Goswami [(1997) 4 SCC 713] (SCC paras 8 and 9); and Kshitish Chandra Purkait v. Santosh Kumar Purkait [(1997) 5 SCC 438] (SCC paras 10 and 12)]. 16. The High Court, in this case, however, formulated a substantial question of law while dictating the in open court. Before such a substantial question of law could be formulated, the parties should have been put to notice. They should have been given an opportunity to meet the same. Although the Court has the requisite jurisdiction to formulate a substantial question of law at a subsequent stage which was not formulated at the time of admission of the second appeal but the requirements laid down in the proviso appended to Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure were required to be met.” 16.1 This Court in Mehboob-Ur-Rehman v. Ahsanul Ghani20, observed in respect of application of Section 100(5) CPC as under: - 18 (2009) 16 SCC 280 Three Judge Bench 19 (2009) 2 SCC 177 Two Judge Bench 20 (2019) 19 SCC 415 Two Judge Bench SURESH LATARUJI RAMTEKE v. SAU. SUMANBAI 499 PANDURANG PETKAR [SANJAY KAROL J.] a) It is not rule under proviso to sub-section (5) to hear any other substantial question of law irrespective of the question(s) formulated, so as to annul other requirements of S. 100, CPC. b) Proviso to come in operation in exceptional cases where reasons are to be recorded by High Court. 16.2 It has further been held that the application of this section is only when some questions, substantial in law, already stand framed. (B.C. Shivashankara v. B.R. Nagaraj21). 16.3 Wrong application of law laid down by the Privy Council, Federal Court or the Supreme Court, will not qualify for substantial question of law and neither wrong application of facts. 16.4 If on an issue, the trial court discusses the evidence but does not return a fi nding thereon, High Court in jurisdiction under Section 100, CPC may do so.
