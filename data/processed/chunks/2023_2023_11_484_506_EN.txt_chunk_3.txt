RAJO @ RAJWA @ RAJENDRA MANDAL v. THE STATE 489 OF BIHAR & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 2. The petitioner (aged 40, at the time), with three other co-accused persons, was convicted1 on 24.05.2001 for the murder of three persons – two of which were police personnel (dafadars) and the third being a chowkidar, who were all on duty during a village mela – by indiscriminate fi ring, while they were waiting to be served food. The petitioner was accused to be one among those who had shot at the deceased victims, in a premediated and planned manner. The trial court sentenced the petitioner and three other co-accused persons to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life; while three other accused were acquitted on all charges. A co-accused (Baudha Mandal), who was the fi rst to fi re at the victims, was killed during the pendency of investigation/trial in a police encounter. The petitioner’s conviction and sentence (along with that of three other co-accused convicts), was affi rmed by the High Court on 01.09.2005.2 Owing to a lack of means and awareness, the petitioner could not approach this court to challenge the same, and his conviction by the High Court, attained fi nality. 3. Pursuant to an of this court, after notice was issued, the respondent-state has fi led an affi davit indicating the computation of his period of sentence undergone, the status of his plea for remission to be granted, as well as the remission policies (as amended from time to time) of the state government. This affi davit confi rms that the petitioner long completed 14 years of actual imprisonment (on 19.07.2013), and in fact has, as on 26.07.2023, completed over 24 years of actual imprisonment. Accounting for the remission earned (of over 4 years and 8 months of remission, i.e., a total 1694 days), he has served 28 years, 8 months and 21 days. It is pertinent to mention that he completed 20 years of actual imprisonment on 19.07.2019, and if computed with remission earned as per prevailing rules, then on 05.11.2014 itself. 4. After the completion of the mandatory 14 years actual imprisonment, and 20 years of custody with remission, the petitioner’s case (application dated 14.04.2021) was considered by the Remission Board on 19.05.2021.
