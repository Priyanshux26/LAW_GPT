599 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. “Your client Babu Hari Prasad Saha was the gomoshta at Calcutta in the employ of the firm of Dwarka Nath Makhan Lal Saha, remunerated by a share of the profits, and being liable for a proportionate share of the losses. He was struck by paralysis in the Bengali year 1307, from which time he could not do active work. He, however, continued to be in Calcutta till 1311 when he left Calcutta and went away to his home at Urapara. Our clients have all along been ready and willing to have the accounts duly taken up to this time that your client retired from Calcutta. Your client as the managing gomostha has to make up and explain the accounts up to that time. Our clients will offer every facility in the matter of the adjustment of accounts. …… It is not the fact that your client retired on 27th June 1910. He ceased to do active work in 1307 and retired in 1311. Our clients have no recollection of any notice from Messrs Dutta and Guha. Our clients are ready to pay to your client whatever may be found due on an adjustment of the accounts up to 1311.” Interpreting the aforesaid letter, in the context of plaintiff’s argument that it be treated as an acknowledgment of subsistence of relationship up to 27 June 1910, the Calcutta High Court held: “Now, as I read that letter, that contains three material statements: it contains a statement that plaintiff was gomostha of the defendants; the second statement is that he was employed up to 1311 (BS) (corresponding with 1904 - 1905], and no longer; and the third statement is that the defendants were willing and ready to pay to the plaintiff whatever might be found due to him on an adjustment of the accounts up to 1311. Now, what is the claim of the plaintiff in this case? He brought his suit in to establish his right to have the accounts taken upon the basis that he was a partner, and that he was entitled to have the accounts taken down to June 1910. The defendants’ solicitors wrote that he was not a partner and that he was not entitled to have the accounts taken up to 1910, but that he was only entitled to have the accounts up to 1311 (BS) (corresponding with 1904 – 600 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 1905). I cannot understand how that can be taken to be an acknowledgement of the right which the plaintiff was endeavoring to substantiate in his plaint. I can understand it being said and argued with considerable force that it was an acknowledgement of some part of the plaintiffs claim, inasmuch as his claim was to have the accounts taken up to June 1910, and inasmuch as the defendants admitted that he was entitled to have the accounts taken up to 1904 - 1905: to that extent it is an acknowledgment, but in my it is not an acknowledgement of the right alleged by the plaintiff, namely, that he was entitled to have the accounts taking up to June 1910.” (Emphasis supplied) 137.
