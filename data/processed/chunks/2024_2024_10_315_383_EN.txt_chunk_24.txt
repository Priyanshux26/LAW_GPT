It cannot at all be held that the stipulation of time is directory, nor can it be waived as a mere irregularity under S.460 (e) or under S.465 Cr.P.C. S.460 saves any erroneous proceeding, inter- alia of taking cognizance; if done in good faith. When sanction is statutorily mandated for taking cognizance and if cognizance is taken without a sanction or on the strength of an invalid one, it cannot be said to be an erroneous proceeding taken in good faith and the act of taking cognizance itself would stand vitiated.” 352 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The State of Kerala, being aggrieved by the final conclusion that the sanction was bad in law, carried in appeal to this Court. The Special Leave Petition bearing number SLP (Crl.) Nos.6981-6983 of 2022, was dismissed as withdrawn with the question of law left open. 28.5.4 A similar view was taken by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Manjeet Singh v. State of Punjab.35 Although decided in the context of bail, it was held that if no decision is taken, in keeping with the timelines of the Rules 2008, the accused would be entitled to interim bail. It concurred with the view expressed by the Kerala High Court in Roopesh (supra). 29. This Court has considered the issue of time-bound sanction. While dealing with sanctions under the PC Act, it was observed by Pamidighantam Sri Narsimha J. speaking for this Court, in Vijay Rajmohan v. Central Bureau of Investigation (Anti-Corruption Branch) 36 as under: “23. Grant of sanction being an exercise of executive power, it is subject to the standard principles of judicial review such as application of independent mind; only by the competent authority, without bias, after consideration of relevant material and by eschewing irrelevant considerations. As the power to grant sanction for prosecution has legal consequences, it must naturally be exercised within a reasonable period. This principle is anyway inbuilt in our legal structure, and our constitutional courts review the legality and proprietary of delayed exercise of power quite frequently… … 29. The sanctioning authority must bear in mind that public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law, which is fundamental in the administration of justice, is at stake here. By causing delay in considering the request for sanction, the sanctioning authority stultifies judicial scrutiny, thereby vitiating the process of determination of the allegations against the corrupt official Subramanian 35 [2022] 19 SCR 563 : CRA-D-5 of 2023 36 (2023) 1 SCC 329 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 353 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. Swamy [Subramanian Swamy v. Manmohan Singh, (2012) 3 SCC 64 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 1041 : (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 666] . Delays in prosecuting the corrupt breeds a culture of impunity and leads to systemic resignation to the existence of corruption in public life. Such inaction is fraught with the risk of making future generations getting accustomed to corruption as a way of life. … … 32. In the first place, non-compliance with a mandatory period cannot and should not automatically lead to the quashing of criminal proceedings because the prosecution of a public servant for corruption has an element of public interest having a direct bearing on the rule of law [Subramanian Swamy v. Manmohan Singh, (2012) 3 SCC 64 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 1041 : (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 666.
