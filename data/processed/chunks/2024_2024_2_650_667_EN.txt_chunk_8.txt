Radhey Udaipur Udaipur Shyam Tripathi s/o Bhagwati Prasad Tripathi 22.1. The Trial Court decided the suits vide and decree dated 30.04.2008. The First Appellate Court decided the appeals vide dated 19.04.2004. 22.2. Civil Suits were filed claiming that the land in question was leased out to the plaintiffs on 27.08.1985 (as is evident from 662 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the of the Trial Court). However, in the documents annexed with the I.A.No.148204 in C.A. No.8977 of 2012, the transaction is shown to be sale. Though no prayer was made in the suit seeking a declaration as owner of the land as it was simpliciter for permanent injunction still the Trial Court framed the issue ‘whether the disputed plot is of the ownership and possession of the plaintiff’. The second issue frame was ‘as to whether the plaintiff is entitled to permanent injunction’. Both the issues were taken up together. While discussing the Issue no.1, the court recorded the ownership part was not to be gone into as it was merely a suit for permanent injunction but still it was to be considered as to whether the possession was valid or not. In support of his plea the plaintiff/respondent placed on record the document dated 27.08.1985, the lease deed. However, the same was not proved. The court also considered about the right of the Gram Panchayat to lease out the land with reference to the Rules applicable therefor. Finally, the Trial Court came to the conclusion that no case was made out by the plaintiff/respondent. Hence, the suit for permanent injunction was dismissed by the Trial Court on 30.04.2003. 22.3. The and decree in all the suits were challenged by filing appeals. The First Appellate Court without considering the fact as to whether the alleged lease deed Ext.E-1 was proved by the respondent-plaintiff in accordance with law, had shifted the burden on defendants to prove otherwise. The issue regarding competence of the Gram Panchayat to lease out the land was just brushed aside. The appeal was accepted and decree of permanent injunction was passed by the First Appellate Court against which the appeal(s) were filed by the present appellants before the High Court. The same was disposed of in terms of the impugned , though the issues were not identical. 22.4. It is admitted by all the respondents/plaintiffs in the bunch of appeals that the individual lease deeds were issued in their favour on 27.08.1985 by the Gram Panchayat. 22.5. The stand of the appellants is that the lease deeds were executed in contravention of Rule 266 of the 1961 Rules, which provides that Panchayat may transfer any land by way [2024] 2 S.C.R.
