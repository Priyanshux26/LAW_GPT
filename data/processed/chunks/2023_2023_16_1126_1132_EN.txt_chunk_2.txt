FIR No. 839/2016 was registered against the appellant, his parents and relatives on 04.09.2016 on the complaint of the second respondent only on 04.09.2016. 6. Further relevant aspects for the purpose of consideration of the case on hand are that in the Application No. 13/2016 fi led under ‘G&W Act’ as early as on 16.05.2016 the Appellant has mentioned clearly that the minor daughter ‘Anwesha Saxena’ is in his custody and beside him, his parents, persons named therein, who are respectively her Nana, Nani, Mama and Mami, are also residing in the house where the daughter ‘Anwesha Saxena’ ordinarily resides. It is months thereafter that the second respondent fi led the complaint causing registration of FIR No. 839/2016 and fi ling of chargesheet. Add to it, it is relevant to note that in the FIR registered on 04.09.2016 the date of incident is shown as 12.06.2016 at 03.00 AM and date of information is shown as on 04.09.2016 at 09.30 AM and the delay in investigation is recorded as the delay in submitting information by the complainant i.e., the second respondent herein. In the written complaint by the second respondent-complainant, the typed copy of which is produced in this proceeding, it is stated that on 12.06.2016 at about 03.05 PM in the afternoon, the appellant, his parents and relatives had caused disappearance of ‘Kumari Anwesha’ and when asked about the daughter they assaulted her, threw her out from fl at No. 4663 in the clothes which she was then wearing and jewellery weighing about 400 gms and Rs. 05,00,000/- in cash; were snatched from her. Furthermore, it is stated therein that the accused persons sent diff erent persons and relatives to the applicant’s father Dr. Anil Gupta and demanded a sum of Rs. 20,00,000/- as ransom. In her statement attached to the FIR, produced in this proceeding, she stated that on 12.06.2016 the 113 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. appellant, his parents and relatives cause disappearance of her daughter and on being asked about her they had beaten her up and snatched golden jewellery and her own savings of Rs. 50,000/-. 7. As the High Court did not endeavour to consider whether the chargesheet submitted showed prima facie case under Sections 323, 384 and 406, IPC for voluntarily causing hurt, for extortion and for criminal breach of trust, we think it inevitable to undertake such a consideration as in the facts and circumstances while called upon to exercise the power under Section 482, CrPC the High Court was legally bound to see if allegations/accusations constitute any off ence or not. As relates the alleged commission of off ence under Section 323, IPC besides the bald statement of the second respondent-complainant ‘when I asked those people about my daughter, they beat up me’ no other material whatsoever is on record. In short, there is no material on record to support the alleged causation of hurt. Though the fi rst respondent fi led a counter affi davit nothing is stated / produced in regard to the said alleged off ence.
