Headnotes Service law – Assam Police Manual – r. 63(iii) – Assam Police Act, 2007 – s. 14(2) – Reporting Authority, entitled to initiate Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs)/Annual Performance Appraisal Reports (APARs) of Indian Police Service (IPS) Officers working as District Superintendents of Police (SPs) in the State of Assam – Assessment initiated by the Deputy Commissioner, as the ‘Reporting Authority’, if lawful – r. 63(iii), if violative of s. 14(2): Held: 1970 Rules/2007 Rules define reporting, reviewing and accepting authorities to mean that they must all be from the same service or department, intervention by the Deputy Commissioner during the exercise of performance assessment of SPs of the districts in the State of Assam, by virtue of r. 63(iii), cannot be accepted, being in direct conflict therewith, and would tantamount to permitting the Deputy Commissioner to interfere with the internal organization of the police force, which would be contrary to the mandate of s.14(2) – It cannot be said that the Deputy Commissioner is the most suitable person to assess the performance of the SP, as he works under his control and direction – Clause 6 in r. 3 relating to appraisal by the ‘Reporting Authority’, Law and is only one of the twenty named domains within the purview of * Author 474 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
