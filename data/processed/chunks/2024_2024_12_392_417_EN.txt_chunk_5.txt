8. On the other hand, Mr. P.V. Dinesh, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent-State submitted that the Trial Court and the High Court have both dealt with this aspect of the matter and have concurrently found that this was a case of culpable homicide amounting to murder. The fact that the appellant was carrying a knife and the number of assaults made by him on the deceased as also the injury would clearly show that the intention was to commit murder. 9. Having heard the learned counsels for the parties, we find it imperative to look into the evidence, witness testimonies, and injury reports to better understand and analyse the incident to see whether the culpable homicide in the present case amounts to murder or not. A meticulous analysis of the evidence on record is necessary to check whether the appellant had the intention to kill the deceased or if he can be given the benefit of reduction of sentence on the grounds pleaded in the appeal. To understand the evidence and their probative value in establishing the offence, it is necessary to look at the categorical findings of both the courts below. FINDINGS OF THE TRIAL COURT 10. The Trial Court found appellant guilty of offences under Sections 302, 326, and 324, IPC. The Trial Court’s findings were primarily based on the direct testimony of PW1, an eyewitness who was also injured in the incident, and corroborative evidence from medical and forensic reports. 11. The evidence of PW1 was crucial to the prosecution’s case. The Trial Court carefully analyzed his testimony and found it credible, reliable, and consistent with the injuries sustained by the deceased and PW1, as recorded in the medical reports. Although the defense argued 400 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports that PW1 was an interested witness and highlighted omissions and contradictions in his testimony, the Trial Court concluded that these discrepancies were minor and did not affect the core narrative. The Trial Court also noted that PW1’s statements were corroborated by PW2, who arrived at the scene shortly after the incident and observed the accused fleeing. PW2’s account was deemed trustworthy and supported the prosecution’s version. 12. The recovery of the murder weapon (a knife, marked as MO1) at the instance of appellant was a significant factor in the Trial Court’s findings. The knife was recovered under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 based on information provided by appellant during his custodial interrogation. Forensic examination confirmed that the knife bore human blood matching the deceased’s blood group. This finding provided compelling corroboration of PW1’s testimony regarding the role of Accused No. 1 in the fatal assault. Additional physical evidence, such as blood-stained sticks recovered from the crime scene, further substantiated the prosecution’s case. 13. Medical evidence also played a vital role. The postmortem report of the deceased, prepared by PW-6 (a police surgeon), confirmed that the cause of death was multiple stab injuries inflicted with a sharp-edged weapon like MO1. PW6 identified specific fatal injuries to the heart and lungs, which were consistent with the prosecution’s narrative of the assault.
