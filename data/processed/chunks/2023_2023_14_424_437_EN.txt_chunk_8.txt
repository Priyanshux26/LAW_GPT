01.12.2000, the same was rejected by the Labour Commissioner, Indore vide dated 16.10.2000. In the aforesaid , a statement of year wise production and sales, and average workmen employed on a daily basis has been extracted. It is from the year 1990-1991 till 1999-2000 for completed years and for the months of April to August 2000. In all these years, the average daily workmen employed were more than 100 except in the year1999-2000, when these were shown to be 99. 20. An application was filed by the respondents-workmen on 09.10.2001 with the appellants-Management raising certain demands. It was on the basis thereof that, reference was made to the Labour Court by the Labour Commissioner vide dated 07.08.2002. Meaning thereby, that the record showing that the appellants-Management was employing more than 100 workmen, was available and was a part of the earlier proceedings before the Labour Commissioner. 21. On the issue as to whether a matter can be remitted back to the Labour Court for a decision afresh, guidance is available from of this Court in Santhosh Bansi Mahajan’s case (supra). It was a case where a document on which reliance was placed by the workmen was not placed before the Labour Court when the matter was considered. It was placed on record for the fi rst time before this Court. Liberty was given by this Court to fi le the said document before the Labour Court and the matter was remitted back to the Labour Court to be decided afresh. Similar issue had come up for decision before this Court in Bundi Zila Petrol Pump Dealers Association’s case (supra) wherein an ex-parte Award was passed against the Management. This Court, fi nding that there were suffi cient reasons for the absence of the Management before the Tribunal, set aside the Award and the matter was remanded to the Industrial Tribunal giving liberty to the appellant before this Court to fi le the written statement and lead evidence. 22. In the case in hand as well on the facts, as noticed above, we fi nd that the matter needs to be re-examined by the Labour Court, as the material HIND FILTERS LTD. & ANR. v. HIND FILTER EMPLOYEES’ 437 UNION & ANR. [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] permitted to be placed on record will go to the root of the case in determining the jurisdiction of the Labour Court to adjudicate the matter. The material sought to be relied upon by the appellants-Management to substantiate its plea has been briefl y referred to in paras 16 and 19 of this . 23. For the reasons, mentioned above, we fi nd merit in the present appeal. The same is accordingly allowed. The impugned passed by the High Court dated 11.05.2011 as well as the s of the Labour Court dated 30.06.2010, 12.08.2010 and 06.10.2010, are set aside. The matter is remitted back to the Labour Court, Dewas for adjudication afresh, after permitting the appellants-Management to lead evidence to substantiate the plea that they were employing more than 100 workmen during the relevant period.
