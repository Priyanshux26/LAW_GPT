This is squarely applicable in the facts of this case. 536 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 2.3 The detention dated 25.08.2022 in the present case is based on the following FIRs against the Petitioner: (a) FIR No. 1/(2021)-Tuni-13 dated 06.01.2021, lodged 1 year 7 months and 20 days prior to the detention . The Petitioner was released on bail in this matter on 08.01.2021. (b) FIR No. 8/(2021)-Tuni-376 dated 13.08.2021, lodged 1 year and 12 days prior to the detention . The Petitioner was released on bail in this matter on 18.08.2021. (c) FIR No. 10/(2021)-Tuni-532 dated 30.09.2021, lodged 10 months and 26 days prior to the detention . The Petitioner was released on bail in this matter on 07.10.2021. (d) FIR No. 3/(2022)-Tuni-213 dated 09.03.2022, lodged 5 months and 17 days prior to the detention . The Petitioner was released on bail in this matter on 08.04.2022. 2.4 There is no allegation regarding the Petitioner’s conduct during the 4 month and 18 day interregnum between him being released on bail in the last FIR (08.04.2022) and being taken into preventive detention (25-26.08.2022). It is therefore apparent that the grounds on which the Petitioner was detained are stale. III. Ordinary Law and is Suffi cient to Deal with the Situation and there is no Prejudice to the Maintenance of Public 3.1 A detention under S. 3(1) or 3(2) of the AP Act can be issued inter alia against a “bootlegger” to prevent him from “acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public ”. It is submitted that the Petitioner is not a ‘bootlegger’ as defi ned under S. 2(b) of the AP Act. There is no material to show that he was engaged in distillation, manufacture, storage, import/ export, sale or distribution of illicitly distilled liquor or was a mastermind engaged in any organized or systemic criminal activity or part of a cartel. The Petitioner has repeatedly asserted that he was merely a daily wage labourer working as a coolie. 3.2 Without prejudice, this Hon’ble Court has, in a catena of s, held that a person cannot be detained merely because he is PESALA NOOKARAJU v. THE GOVERNMENT OF 537 ANDHRA PRADESH & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] a bootlegger, unless the activity also aff ects public . Pertinently, it was alleged that the detenus in these cases were using dangerous weapons/ arms, force and violence, had created an atmosphere of fear and terror amongst the residents in the area. These were nevertheless not considered grievous enough to aff ect ‘public ’ or warrant preventive detention. (a) Piyush Kantilal Mehta v. Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad City & Anr.
