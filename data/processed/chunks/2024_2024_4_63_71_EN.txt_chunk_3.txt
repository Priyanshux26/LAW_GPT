67 The General Manager, M/S Barsua Iron Ore Mines v. The Vice President United Mines Mazdoor Union and Ors. 9. In the meanwhile, on 31.12.2008, the respondent no.3 superannuated from service, having attained the age of 60 years, based on his initially recorded date of birth [27.12.1948]. 10. On 24.01.2018, the CGIT passed its Award and held that the appellant’s determination of the respondent no.3’s date of birth based on the initial Descriptive Roll was unjustified and thus, awarded him 50% back wages from his retirement in 2008 until his supposed date of superannuation in 2015, based on the date of birth disclosed in the STC i.e., 12.03.1955. The appellant filed a Writ Petition before the High Court of Orissa at Cuttack on 19.05.2019 challenging the Award passed by the CGIT on 24.01.2018. The of the High Court dismissing the same on 04.02.2021, is impugned in the present appeal. SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANT: 11. Learned Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the conduct of the respondent no.3 clearly dis-entitled him to any relief as he could not have been allowed to resile from his initially declared date of birth, that too after 9 years of his initial declaration, on 27.12.1972. It was submitted that the said declaration by the respondent no.3 himself on 27.12.1972, cannot be said to be an inadvertent error or omission for the reason that had the so-called correct date of birth, according to the respondent no.3, i.e., 12.03.1955 been declared, then at the relevant point of time, he would have been only 17 years and 1 month old and could not have been given the employment he had sought, since the minimum age required was 18 years. Thus, it was submitted that it was clear that he had tried to take employment relying on his date of birth as 27.12.1948, Service Commission established, under Section 3 of the Banking Service Commission Act, 1975, or an air transport service, or a banking or an insurance company, a mine, an oilfield, a Cantonment Board, or a major port, any company in which not less than fifty-one per cent of the paid-up share capital is held by the Central Government, or any corporation, not being a corporation referred to in this clause, established by or under any law made by Parliament, or the Central public sector undertaking, subsidiary companies set up by the principal undertaking and autonomous bodies owned or controlled by the Central Government, the Central Government, and (ii) in relation to any other industrial dispute, including the State public sector undertaking, subsidiary companies set up by the principal undertaking and autonomous bodies owned or controlled by the State Government, the State Government: Provided that in case of a dispute between a contractor and the contract labour employed through the contractor in any industrial establishment where such dispute first arose, the appropriate Government shall be the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, which has control over such industrial establishment.’ 68 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
