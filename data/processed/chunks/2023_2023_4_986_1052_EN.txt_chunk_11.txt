The F Magistrate vide dated 12.11.2018 rejected the said application on the ground that the criminal proceedings under the NI Act had nothing to do with the proceedings under the IBC. 14. On 27.02.2019, the NCLT approved the resolution plan so far as the corporate debtor is concerned. G 15. As the resolution plan came to be approved by the NCLT, the appellant herein filed an application dated 20.07.2019 before the trial court, praying that he be discharged from the criminal proceedings. The case of the appellant herein before the Magistrate was that as the debt stood settled in the proceedings under the IBC, the criminal proceedings would not survive.

The trial court vide dated 01.11.2019 rejected the A aforesaid application essentially on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to discharge an accused in a summons triable case. 17.

The appellant contended before the revisional court that as the debt in connection with which the criminal proceedings had been initiated, formed part of the approved resolution plan the outstanding debt under the NI Act could be said to have stood settled. 18. The Additional Judge vide the impugned dated 23.11.2019 C rejected the Revision Application. 19. In such circumstances, referred to above, the appellant is here before this Court with the present appeal. THE SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT D 20. Mr. Nikhil Goel, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant made the following submissions: A. The trigger of Section 138 of the NI Act, is the non-payment of legally enforceable debt. Once the debt itself gets extinguished either under Section 31 of the IBC or in the E process from Sections 38 to 41 and 54 resply of the IBC, the basis of Section 138 of the NI Act no longer remains. The term debt would mean the ‘legally enforceable debt’ under the explanation to Section 138 of the NI Act. This may be read with Section 2(6) & 2(8) resply of the IBC. F B. The liability is primarily of the company and prosecution of natural persons under Section 141 of the NI Act is vicarious to the prosecution of the company. It is for this reason that a director cannot be prosecuted without making the company as an accused. [See Ajit Balse v. Ranga Karkere: (2015) 15 SCC 748.] G C. The nature of proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act is primarily compensatory and the punitive element is incorporated at enforcing the compensatory provisions. (paras 53 & 63 resply in P. Mohanraj and Others v. Shah Brothers Ispat Private Limitedreported in (2021) 6 SCC H 1002 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 258). Therefore, once recovery is made, partly by receipt of money and partly by waiver, Section 138 of the NI Act should not be permitted to be continued.
