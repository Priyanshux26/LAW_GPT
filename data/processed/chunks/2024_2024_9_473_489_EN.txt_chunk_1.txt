[Paras 9-12, 15, 19] Interpretation of Statutes – Literal construction vis-à-vis purposive interpretation – Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.29A(4): Held: While interpreting a statute, an interpretation which produces an unreasonable result is not to be imputed to a statute if there is some other equally possible construction which is acceptable, practical and pragmatic – An interpretive exercise must be conducted with careful consideration of both the text and the context of the provision – Therefore, sometimes the court eschews a literal construction if it produces manifest absurdity or unjust results – An interpretive process must recognize the goal or purpose of the legal text – s.29A intends to ensure the timely completion of arbitral proceedings while allowing courts the flexibility to grant extensions when warranted – Prescribing a limitation period, unless clearly stated in words or necessary, should not be accepted – Bar by limitation has penal and fatal consequences.
