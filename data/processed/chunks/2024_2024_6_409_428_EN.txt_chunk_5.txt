7. The responsibility of the police officer to promptly inform the Magistrate about the seizure can be historically traced to the 1882 Code. Oddly enough, this provision was absent in the 1898 Code. In the 1898 Code, however, it was provided that if the seizing officer was below the rank of an officer-in charge of a police station, then such officer was under a duty to give information to his superior regarding the seized property. It appears that the provision as it existed in the 1898 Code was retained as is in the 1973 Code. Sub- section (3) to Section 102 was inserted by way of an amendment only in the year 1978. This amendment reintroduced the reporting obligations of police officer to the Magistrate, as it originally existed in the 1882 Code. It also empowered the seizing officer to give custody of the seized property to any person, on such person executing a bond undertaking to produce the property before the Court as and when required. There was no provision in the 1973 Code nor the 1898 Code till the insertion of sub-section (3) by an amendment in 1978, empowering the police to take a bond from a person undertaking to produce the property entrusted to 418 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports him by the police later on before the Court. The law as it existed then was that the bond could be entered before the Court but not in favour of the police. While setting aside the of forfeiture in regard to the bond in favour of the police, this Court in Anwar Ahmad v State of UP14, pointed out the lacuna in the 1973 Code and suggested the insertion of a suitable provision. That is why this sub-section (3) empowering the police to execute the bond under certain conditionalities came to be inserted by way of the 1978 Amendment. For the sake of completeness, it may be observed that Section 102 Cr.P.C. in its present form has been retained as is in the 2023 Code, which is scheduled to come into force on 1st July 2024 and replace the 1973 Code. 8. The Notes on Clauses appended to the 1978 Bill had set out the following reasons for inserting sub section (3) to Section 102 Cr.P.C. : “Clause 10- Section 102 is being amended (1) to provide that the police officer shall forthwith report the seizure of any property under sub-section (1) to the Magistrate, as there is a lacuna in the Law and (2) to give effect to the observations of the Supreme Court made in Anwar Ahmad vs. the State of U.P. (AIR 1976 SC 680) that the police should be given the power to get a bond from the person to whom the property seized is entrusted, particularly in cases where a bulky property like elephant or car, is seized and the Magistrate is living at a great distance and it is difficult to produce the property seized before the Magistrate.” 9.
