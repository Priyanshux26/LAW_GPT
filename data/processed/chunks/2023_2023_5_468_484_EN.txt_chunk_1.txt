[Para 34][480-B-D] D 1.3 The claim of AP(M)L is with regard to shortfall in the assured quantity of 70%, and not above that. From the passed by the APTEL, it is clear that it has been the consistent stand of the appellants that AP(M)L was in a position to generate and supply contracted capacity of 1424 MW out of the fuel linkage arising out of the FSA dated 9th June 2012 with Mahanadi Coal E Field Limited. It has been its stand that AP(M)L should use the entire domestic coal availability towards the contracted capacity of the appellants first, and then use the imported coal for the deficit to reach the targeted PLF. It has further been its stand that the entire domestic coal available should be accounted F towards 1424 MW contracted to Haryana Utilities. [Paras 35 and 36][480-D-F] 1.4 The entire domestic coal linkage came to be utilized for supplying power to Haryana Utilities, it is unjust on the part of Haryana Utilities to say that 70% of the installed capacity should be further bifurcated and the Change in Law benefit should be G restricted only to 70% of the installed capacity which was allotted by the SLC (LT). [Para 40]P481-C-D] H 470 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 1.5 Even according to Haryana Utilities, the entire coal covered under FSA was required to be utilized for generating power to be supplied to it as per the Memorandum of Understanding. Therefore, denial of the benefit of shortfall of the coal assured under FSA, would be contrary to the restitutionary principle. In any case, the APTEL has clarified that AP(M)L was B neither claiming nor was entitled to claim any Change in Law compensation beyond the one which was covered by linkage coal, i.e. 1386 MW. [Paras 41, 42][481-D-F] 1.6 To a specific query by the APTEL, it was fairly conceded by the counsel for Haryana Utilities that the MoUs were general C in nature and not specific for Phase IV Mundra Power Plant. As such, the finding of the APTEL that the MoUs annexed with the bid were only to show its competence to participate in the bid, and that it cannot be stretched to hold that the bidder was to procure imported coal to the extent of 30% for the project, cannot D be said to be perverse. [Para 44][481-F-H] 1.7 No error could be found with the concurrent findings that AP(M)L was entitled to Change in Law relief for 100% of the contracted capacity i.e. 1386 MW, which is 70% of the installed capacity of 1980 MW of the Phase IV extension of Mundra Project. E The finding of the CERC and the APTEL is to the effect that AP(M)L would not be entitled to any benefit of Change in Law beyond 70% of the installed capacity i.e. 1386 MW. The said findings cannot be said to not be based on the material on record, or based on extraneous considerations. [Para 46][482-C-E] 1.8 The Perusal of the passed by the APTEL would F reveal that AP(M)L had proposed a methodology based on the methodology approved by the CERC in the GMR Kamalanga Energy Limited and Another v. Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited and Others’s case considering the quoted tariff under the PPAs as the base.
