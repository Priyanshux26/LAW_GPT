5 SCR 833 : (2005) 1 SCC 496 14 [2024] 4 SCR 340 : (2024) SCC OnLine SC 497 15 [2005] Supp. 1 SCR 359 : (2005) 10 SCC 746 [2024] 9 S.C.R. 179 Seetharama Shetty v. Monappa Shetty authenticated copy of such instrument together with the amount of duty and penalty so levied and collected. Section 37(2) of the Act deals with an instrument not subjected to the procedure of Sections 34 or 36 of the Act. According to Section 37(2) of the Act, the instrument is sent to the Deputy Commissioner for enquiry and decision at his end. The Deputy Commissioner gets jurisdiction under Section 39 of the Act and then decides the duty and also the penalty leviable on the insufficiently stamped instrument. In this background, we take note of the principle laid down on the distinction in the discretion available to Every Person/Court and the discretionary jurisdiction conferred on the District Registrar. See, United Precision Engineers (supra) and Gangappa (supra). The settled distinction and discretion available under Sections 34 and 39 of the Act is no more res integra. 18. The above consideration does not actually address the appellant’s argument under Section 37(2) read with Section 39 of the Act. Appellant contends that the respondents by filing an application for impounding the instrument, preferred to have deficit stamp duty and the penalty collected exclusively by the District Registrar because the admissibility or otherwise of the suit document is not yet considered by the trial court for any purpose. From the record, it appears that the instrument is likely to be considered at the interlocutory stage for granting or refusing temporary injunction. Therefore, the option available under Section 33 read with Section 37 of the Act is set in motion, resulting in the instrument being sent to the District Registrar, and calling for a report. 19. A Three-Judge Bench of this Court in Trustees of HC Dhandha Trust v State of Madhya Pradesh16 held that in case of deficiency of Stamp Duty the Collector of Stamps cannot impose ten times penalty under Section 40(1)(b) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 (analogous to Section 39(1)(b) of the Act) automatically or mechanically. The relevant paragraph reads thus: “22. The purpose of penalty generally is a deterrence and not retribution. When a discretion is given to a public 16 [2020] 11 SCR 268 : (2020) SCC OnLine SC 753 180 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports authority, such public authority should exercise such discretion reasonably and not in oppressive manner. The responsibility to exercise the discretion in reasonable manner lies more in cases where discretion vested by the statute is unfettered. Imposition of the extreme penalty i.e. ten times of the duty or deficient portion thereof cannot be based on the mere factum of evasion of duty. The reason such as fraud or deceit in to deprive the Revenue or undue enrichment are relevant factors to arrive at a decision as to what should be the extent of penalty under Section 40(1)(b).
