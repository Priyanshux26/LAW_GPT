The Transfer Petitions in these proceedings are allowed. 2. The terms ‘LBGTQ’ and ‘queer’ are used interchangeably and as umbrella expressions to capture the various sexual orientations and gender identities that exist. 3. The term ‘union between queer persons’ or similar terms have been used to mean relationship between parties where one or both of them have an atypical gender identity or sexual orientation. A*. Background i. The decision of this Court in Navtej Singh Johar 4. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code 18601 criminalizes “carnal intercourse against the of nature.” History is replete with instances of the State having used the provision to rip-off the dignity and autonomy of individuals who engaged in sexual activity with persons of the same sex.2 A colonial provision which refl ected Victorian morality continued in the statute after Independence. Section 377 was also weaponized against gender non-conforming persons.3 Intimate relationships and activities were subject to public ridicule and judicial scrutiny. By criminalizing sexual behavior of homosexual and gender non-conforming persons, the State stripped them of their identity and personhood. Those who defi ed the mandate of the law and dodged prosecution were socially ostracized. 5. In Naz Foundation v. Government of NCTD4, a Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi read down Section 377 of the IPC to exclude consensual homosexual sexual activity between adults. On appeal, a two- Judge Bench of this Court in Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation5 reversed the of the High Court of Delhi. A writ petition seeking to declare the right to sexuality, the right to sexual autonomy, and the right to choice of a sexual partner as a part of the rights guaranteed under * Ed.
