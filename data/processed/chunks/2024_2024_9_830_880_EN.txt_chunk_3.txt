According to the writ petitioners, they constructed DP Roads at their own cost and voluntarily surrendered the reserved [2024] 9 S.C.R. 835 Kukreja Construction Company & Others v. State of Maharashtra & Others lands to the Mumbai Municipal Corporation. In lieu thereof, in terms of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 126 of the MRTP Act read with Regulations 33 and 34 as well as Para 5 of Appendix-VII of DCR, the writ petitioners were granted Floor Space Index (“FSI” for short) and/or Transferrable Development Rights (“TDR” for short) in the form of Development Rights Certificates (“DRC” for short) equal to the gross area of the plots surrendered by them. Para 6 of Appendix-VII (as it stood prior to its amendment) provided that when an owner or a lessee also develops or constructs the amenities on the surrendered plot at his own cost and hands over the developed/ constructed amenity to the Municipal Commissioner, he is entitled to DRC in the form of FSI or TDR equivalent to the area of construction/ development done by him. The expression “amenity” has been defined in sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the MRTP Act as well as clause (7) of Regulation 3 of DCR. 2.1 For the purpose of implementation of the DCR, two Circulars were issued on 09.04.1996 and 05.04.2003. By Circular dated 09.04.1996, the DRC equivalent to 15% area of the DP Road constructed by the owner or lessee on the surrendered plot was to be provided when the owner or lessee surrendered the developed amenity together with the reserved plot. By Circular dated 05.04.2003, the figure was enhanced to 25%. 2.2 In Godrej & Boyce I, this Court held that the expression “equivalent” in Para 6 of Appendix-VII would entitle the owner or lessee to 100% FSI or TDR for the construction of an amenity at his cost. Therefore, FSI or TDR for construction of an amenity would not be confined to 15% or 25% of DP Road area and it would be equivalent to 100% of the area of the road constructed by the owner or the lessee. 2.3 The grievance of the writ petitioners before the High Court was that the Mumbai Municipal Corporation had declined to grant 100% additional TDR equivalent to the area of the amenity developed. By a notification issued on 16.11.2016, Regulation 34 of the DCR was amended. As a result, Appendix-VII was virtually obliterated from the DCR. The notification dated 16.11.2016 was assailed and question arose as to whether the modifications made by the notification amending Regulation 34 of the DCR would have retrospective or retroactive operation. 836 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 2.4 The High Court made a brief reference to the facts of each of the writ petitions and considered the detailed submissions made on behalf of the writ petitioners, the Mumbai Municipal Corporation and the State Government. Contentions before the High Court: 3. It was contended on behalf of the writ petitioners before the High Court that the unamended Regulation 33(1) of the DCR enabled the owner of the land to seek benefit of FSI of the land reserved for DP Road and utilize the same on the remaining land.
