The intent of the Code is to discourage individual actions for enforcement and settlement to the exclusion of the general benefit of all creditors.” (emphasis supplied) 50. The ILC Report found that in several cases, a settlement may be reached amongst “all creditors and the debtor” for withdrawal, and 39 “ILC” 40 “ILC Report” 1834 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
