As such, a Circular was issued by the appellant on 22.05.2017 (hereinafter referred to as the “Circular”) inviting applications from all eligible Managers (Technical) for promotion to the post of Deputy General Manager (Technical). Clause 6 of the said Circular is extracted hereunder: “6. It has also been decided to treat the deputation service (if any) rendered on the post of Manager (Technical) in NHAI as regular service for the purpose of promotion to the post of DGM (Technical). It has also been decided that the Manager (Technical), when found suitable for promotion, shall be promoted to the post of DGM (Technical) notionally with effect from the date they fulfil the eligibility criteria for the promotion, but not before the 524 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports date of absorption and the date of promotion of applicants in OA 3696/2014 and 3762/2014 i.e. dated 29.12.2014, subject to recommendations of the Selection Committee. The actual promotion shall take effect from the date of assumption of charge against the post of DGM (Technical).” 6. The issue of considering deputation service as regular service for promotion to the post of Deputy General Manager (Technical) was deliberated on in a Meeting of the Executive Committee of the appellant held on 12.10.2017. The decision thereon, as recorded in the Minutes of Meeting dated 20.10.2017, is reproduced hereunder: “(c) As a strict one time measure and a special case, the deputation service (including period of absence from NHAI for fulfilling administrative formalities e.g. submission/ acceptance of technical resignation / retirement etc.) will be treated as regular service for the purpose of reckoning eligibility for the promotion to the post of DGM (Tech. ), in respect of Managers (Tech.) who have subsequently been appointed in NHAI on Direct Recruitment basis as Manager (Tech.). This will also end prolonged litigation and ensure fairness and justice to the candidates who chose to face competition by going for direct recruitment.” 7. The respondent no.1 applied for promotion to the post of Deputy General Manager (Technical). The Screening Committee of the appellant declared him ‘not eligible’. Accordingly, a promotion dated 26.09.2017 was passed by the appellant in respect of thirty-nine Managers (Technical) to the posts of Deputy General Managers (Technical). Thereafter, the respondent no.1 sent Representations dated 18.06.2018, 22.11.2018 and 24.04.2019 to the appellant to consider his candidature. As no decision was taken on the same, he approached the CAT by way of O.A. No.310/00992/2019, which was disposed of vide dated 26.07.2019. The CAT directed the appellant to consider the representations supra in light of the Circular and pass a speaking within four months. 8. After considering the Representations of respondent no.1, the appellant vide dated 05.11.2019 observed that his case may not be treated as similar to that of three other officers, since, those officers had appeared in the direct recruitment examination of Manager (Technical) while working in the appellant whereas respondent no.1 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 525 National Highway Authority of India v. G Athipathi and Others had taken the examination after his repatriation and was working in his parent department.
