[Paras 58 and 59] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.367, 368 and proviso thereto – Duty of High Court u/s.367: Held: Under the proviso to s.368, no of confi rmation is to be made until the period allowed for preferring the appeal has expired, or, if an appeal is presented within such period, until such appeal is disposed of, so that, if an appeal is fi led by a condemned prisoner, that appeal has to be disposed of before any is made in the reference confi rming the sentence of death – In disposing of such an appeal, however, it is necessary that the High Court should keep in view its duty u/s.367 – It must examine the appeal record for itself, arrive at a view whether a further enquiry or taking of additional evidence is desirable or not, and then come to its own conclusion on the entire material on record whether conviction of the condemned prisoner is justifi ed and the sentence of death should be confi rmed. [Para 59] Criminal Law – Criminal justice system – Accusatorial/adversarial system: Held: For the dispensation of criminal justice, India follows the accusatorial or adversarial system of common law – In the accusatorial or 1010 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. adversarial system, the accused is presumed to be innocent; prosecution and defence each put their case; judge acts as an impartial umpire and while acting as a neutral umpire sees whether the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt or not. [Para 66] Constitution of India – Article 21 – Free and fair trial, a sine-qua- non: Held: Free and fair trial is sine-qua-non of Article 21 – If the criminal trial is not free and fair, then the confi dence of the public in the judicial fairness of a judge and the justice delivery system would be shaken – Denial to fair trial is as much injustice to the accused as to the victim and the society – No trial can be treated as a fair trial unless there is an impartial judge conducting the trial, an honest, able and fair defence counsel and equally honest, able and fair public prosecutor – A fair trial necessarily includes fair and proper opportunity to the prosecutor to prove the guilt of the accused and opportunity to the accused to prove his innocence.
