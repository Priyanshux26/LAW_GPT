14. On 17th February 2014, MoC cancelled and deallocated Lohara Coal Blocks on the ground that Environmental Clearance (EC) and Forest H 656 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A Clearance (FC) were not given to the said coal blocks. Vide dated 5th May 2014, MERC, in Suo Motu Case No. 63 of 2014, devised a mechanism for calculating the compensatory fuel charges payable to APML by MSEDCL. The said was challenged by MSEDCL and Prayas in Appeal No. 166 of 2014 and Appeal No. 218 of 2014 respectively. B 15. On 25th August 2014, this Court, in its in the case of Manohar Lal Sharma v. The Principal Secretary and Others1, held the allocation of coal blocks made by the Screening Committee from 14th July 1993 onwards to be illegal. On 16th April 2015, Ministry of Power (for short, “MoP”) issued a policy direction under Section 107 of C the Electricity Act, 2003 to treat allocation of coal block under Coal Mine (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 2014 as a ‘Change in Law’ event. On 28th January 2016, the MoP notified the revised Tariff Policy. 16. On 11th May 2016, APTEL partly allowed Appeal No. 296 of 2013 filed by Prayas setting aside the of MERC dated 21st August D 2013, except on the issue of ToR cancellation not being a force majeure event. Vide the said dated 11th May 2016, APTEL also allowed the appeals filed by MSEDCL and Prayas against the MERC’s dated 5th May 2014. APTEL held that MERC cannot exercise regulatory powers, thereby setting aside the award of compensatory fuel charge to E APML by MERC in exercise of its regulatory power. APTEL, however, kept the force majeure issue open for the decision on the issue of withdrawal of ToR. 17. In the meantime, on 11th April 2017, this Court delivered a in the case of Energy Watchdog v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and Others2, wherein the Court held that F change in policies of the Government affecting availability of domestic coal to the generating companies qualifies as a ‘Change in Law’ event as defined in the PPAs. Consequently, vide dated 31st May 2019, APTEL allowed the appeal filed by APML being Appeal No. 241 of 2016 and set aside the of the MERC dated 21st August 2013 and G remanded the matter to MERC for fresh consideration in the light of of this Court in the case of Energy Watchdog (supra). 18. Being aggrieved thereby, MSEDCL preferred an appeal, being Appeal No. 340 of 2019, on the ground that MERC erred in declaring 1 (2014) 9 SCC 516 H 2 (2017) 14 SCC 80 MAHARASHTRA STATE ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION CO. LTD. v. 657 ADANI POWER MAHARASHTRA LTD. [B. R. GAVAI, J. ] the event of deallocation of Lohara Coal Blocks as ‘Change in Law’ A event under the PPA. APML preferred a cross-appeal, being Appeal No. 354 of 2019, on the ground that, while granting relief on account of ‘Change in Law’, MERC had adopted an erroneous methodology which does not restore it to the same economic position as if no ‘Change in Law’ had occurred.
