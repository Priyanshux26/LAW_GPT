Plea of adverse possession is not a pure question of law but a blend of fact and law. Therefore, a person who claims adverse possession should show : (a) on what date he came into possession; (b) what was the nature of his possession; (c) whether the factum of possession was known to the other party; (d) how long his possession has continued; and (e) his possession was open and undisturbed. A person pleading adverse possession has no equities in his favour. Since he is trying to defeat the rights of the true owner, it is for him to clearly plead and establish all facts necessary to prove his adverse possession. 22 1991 MP LJ 81 23 [2005] Supp. (4) SCR 253 : (2005) 8 SCC 330 24 [2004] Supp. (1) SCR 255 : (2004) 10 SCC 779 342 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 21. This Court in Hemaji Waghaji Jat v. Bhikhabhai Khengarbhai Harijan (2-Judge Bench)25, reiterating the observations made in P.T. Munichikkanna Reddy v. Revamma (2-Judge Bench)26 in respect of the concept of adverse possession observed that efficacy of adverse possession law in most jurisdictions depends on strong limitation statutes by operation of which, right to access the court expires through efflux of time. As against the rights of the paper- owner, in the context of adverse possession, there evolves a set of competing rights in favour of the adverse possessor who has, for a long period of time, cared for the land, developed it, as against the owner of the property who has ignored the property. Modern statutes of limitation operate, as a rule, not only to cut off one’s right to bring an action for the recovery of property that has been in the adverse possession of another for a specified time but also to vest the possessor with title. The intention of such statutes is not to punish one who neglects to assert rights but to protect those who have maintained the possession of property for the time specified by the statute under a claim of right or colour of title. 22. In Bharat Barrel and Drum Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. ESI Corpn.27, (2-Judge Bench) while discussing the object of Limitation Act, this Court opined that: “ ….The law of limitation appertains to remedies because the rule is that claims in respect of rights cannot be entertained if not commenced within the time prescribed by the statute in respect of that right. Apart from Legislative action prescribing the time, there is no period of limitation recognised under the general law and therefore any time fixed by the statute is necessarily to be arbitrary. A statute prescribing limitation however does not confer a right of action nor speaking generally does not confer on a person a right to relief which has been barred by efflux of time prescribed by the law. The necessity for enacting periods of limitation is to ensure that actions are commenced within a particular period, firstly to assure the availability 25 [2008] 13 SCR 818 : (2009) 16 SCC 517 26 [2007] 5 SCR 491 : (2007) 6 SCC 59 27 [1972] 1 SCR 867 : (1971) 2 SCC 860 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
