Union of India, (2018) 8 SCC 501 66 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. b. The history of the Union of India and Jammu and Kashmir 96. In 1834, Zorawar Singh, the General commanding the army of Gulab Singh, the Maharaja of Jammu invaded Ladakh. Ladakh came under Dogra rule and was incorporated into the State of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846. In the course of the Sino-Sikh War in 1841-42, the Qing empire invaded Ladakh but the Sino Tibetan army was defeated. On 9 March 1846, the Treaty of Lahore was executed between the Maharaja of Lahore and the British Government, resulting in the transfer of certain territories to the East India Company. At Partition in 1947, Ladakh was a part of Jammu and Kashmir and was administered from Srinagar. 97. Following the Treaty of Lahore, the British Government executed the Treaty of Amritsar on 16 March 1846 in terms of which the hilly mountainous country with its dependencies situated to the east of the river Indus and west of the Ravi, including Chamba, and excluding Lahaul were transferred by the British Government to Maharaja Gulab Singh of Jammu. Maharaja Gulab Singh died on 30 June 1857 and was succeeded by his son Maharaja Ranbir Singh. Initially, the State was ruled as a monarchy and as a consequence, sovereignty vested in the monarch. 98. Following the passage of the Government of India Act 1858 on 2 August 1858, territories formally in the possession or under the control of the East India Company were vested in the British Monarch in whose name India was to be governed. Maharaja Ranbir Singh died in 1885 and was succeeded by Maharaja Pratap Singh. 99. On 30 August 1889, the British Parliament enacted the Interpretation Act 1889. Section 18(4) defi ned the expression British India to comprise of : “all territories and places withing Her Majesty’s dominions which are for the time being governed by Her Majesty through the Governor- General of India…” 100. The term “India” was defi ned in Section 18(5) as comprising of : “British India together with any territories of native prince or chief under the suzerainty of Her Majesty exercised through the Governor- General of India…” The suzerainty of the colonising British over the territory of Jammu IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 67 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] and Kashmir was such that external sovereignty rested with the Crown. 101. Maharaja Pratap Singh was succeeded in 1925 by Maharaja Hari Singh, the last Ruler of the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir. On 20 April 1927, the expression “State Subject” was defi ned in a notifi cation issued by Maharaja in terms of which ‘State Subjects’ were classifi ed into four categories which were subsequently to become the basis of the defi nition of the expression “Permanent Residents” of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 35A of the Constitution of India as it applied to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.
