Digital Supreme Court Reports not the definitive saving grace – State of Haryana v. Vinod Oil & General Millsrelied on. [Paras 12-26] Constitution of India, Article 14 – Acquisition of Appellant’s land not discriminatory – Acquisition of 99.78% of the initially notified land shows State’s intention to acquire uniformly – Mere Plea regarding differential treatment insufficient – Article 14 cannot be ordinarily employed as a ground to claim negative equality– Illegality, if any, has since been remedied – Material subsequent event should have been noted by High Court: Held: Respondents claimed that land belonging to Maharaja Harinder Singh ‘Khalaf’ Maharaja Varinder Singh had been exempted from acquisition – The High Court accepted this argument and quashed the acquisition, holding that similarly placed landowners had been left out of acquisition process – Held, patently erroneous – Acquisition of 99.78% of the initially notified land shows State’s intention to acquire uniformly – Mere plea regarding differential treatment insufficient; burden lies on the Respondents to not only prove disparate treatment of equals, but that it amounts to hostile discrimination as well – Article 14 cannot be used to claim negative equality – Solution to some lands being unjustifiably left out is to direct their acquisition, not encourage the exclusion of more lands – High Court should have annulled illicit benefit received by the similarly placed person – Land of Maharaja Harinder Singh ‘Khalaf’ Maharaja Varinder Singh subsequently acquired before impugned – Illegality, if any, has since been remedied – Material subsequent event should have been noted by High Court. [Paras 27-31] Land Acquisition – State Government’s decision to release Respondents’ land from acquisition – If suffers from manifest arbitrariness: Held: During the pendency of proceedings, the State Government conveyed its decision to release the Respondents’ land from acquisition on the condition that a portion be used for building of roads and other public amenities and the rest only for charitable, i.e. non-commercial, purposes, and the Respondents agreed – Perusal of records casts cloud of doubt on legal necessity of release of land – Crucial policy decisions finalised by very junior officials; files receiving approval at exceptional speed; important issues not [2024] 10 S.C.R. 2281 Haryana Urban Development Authority v. Abhishek Gupta etc. considered – Decision manifestly arbitrary – State Government possesses the power to release the land for lawful considerations – Cannot do so whimsically, irrationally, without any application of mind, or selectively – Parties’ compromise not accepted. [Paras 32-46] Doctrine/ Principles – Doctrine of Merger – Effect of previous SLPs against same impugned being dismissed after grant of leave – Doctrine of merger neither adoctrine of constitutional law nor of statutory recognition – Common law principle directed towards judicial propriety should not be applied in a straitjacket manner – Exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution used to carve out exception to doctrine of merger: Held: Earlier SLPs by the State challenging the same impugned of the High Court had been dismissed after grant of leave – Arguably doctrine of merger would be attracted – However, impugned judgement of the High Court found to be patently unjust and could adversely affect the subject acquisition, leading to significant harm to the public at large –Fit case to invoke powers under Article 142 and carve out an exception to do complete justice to the parties –Reliance on Kunhayammed, Khoday Distilleries and GNCTD v BSK Realtors.
