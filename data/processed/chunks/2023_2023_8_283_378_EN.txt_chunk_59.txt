But appellant No.2 has sold the land of the extent of acres 42, out of the total extent of acres 62 in Survey No.145/1 to a Co-operative Housing Building Society. Appellant No.3 claims to have sold the entire extent of acre 30.00 in Survey No.163/3 of Hydernagar village to third parties. H M/s TRINITY INFRAVENTURES LTD. & ORS. ETC. v. M. S. 369 MURTHY & ORS. ETC. [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] 206. We do not know how persons can sell identified parcels of A land purportedly allotted to them, out of undivided shares of land in a partition suit in which final decrees and Receiver’s reports galore. 207. The argument of Shri V.V.S. Rao, learned senior counsel on behalf of these appellants who claim to be the legal heirs of defendant No.1, is that in a dispute arising out of claim petitions under XXI B Rules 97 to 101 CPC relating to land in Survey No.172, the High Court could not have set at naught the transactions relating to Survey Nos.145 and 163.The declaration that the preliminary decree is vitiated by fraud, has affected the claim of these appellants to other lands in Survey Nos. 145 and 163 and hence these appellants have come up with a limited C challenge to the impugned . 208. All that we can say in response to this argument is that if parties can hoodwink the Court and take the Court on a detour up to Mysore (two suit schedule properties were located in Mysore) and make a simple suit for partition into a suit for all kinds of disputes, the Court alone cannot stick to the boundaries. D 209. In view of the above, all the appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos.8884-8887 of 2022, SLP (C) Nos.8888-8891 of 2022 and SLP (C) No.24098 of 2022 are liable to be dismissed. Accordingly, they are dismissed. E Part-VII : I.A. No. 118143 of 2022 in SLP (C ) No. 8884 of 2022 210. This application has been filed by Mohd. Mustafauddin Khan and another seeking intervention in the appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.8884 of 2022 filed by Sameena Kausar and others. F 211. The applicants herein are the legal heirs of Mohd. Ghousuddin Khan, who was defendant No.52 in the suit. The applicants claim that defendant No.52 was allotted land of the extent of acres 62 in Survey No.172 of Hydernagar. Interestingly, they assail the very sale deed dated 30.08.1964 under which HEH the Nizam allegedly bought the decretal G rights over the said property. According to the applicants, defendant No.52 never sold his share in favour of HEH the Nizam and Khasim Nawaz Jung. They also contend that the sale was not supported by any consideration and that in any case the sale is void for want of permission under Sections 47 and 48 of the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Agricultural Lands Act, 1950. H 370 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 212. Another interesting aspect brought to light by these applicants is that HEH the Nizam died even during the pendency of the application for impleadment in Application No.109 of 1966 and that therefore everything that happened pursuant to the impleadment were null and void.
