The decisions in Wazir E Chand v. State of H.P. [AIR 1954 SC 415: (1955) 1 SCR 408 : 1954 SCJ 600 : 1954 Cri LJ 1029] and Bishan Das v. State of Punjab [AIR 1961 SC 1570 : (1962) 2 SCR 69 : (1963) 1 SCJ 405] are an authority for the proposition that an illegal seizure amounts to deprivation of property without the authority of law. In Wazir Chand case [AIR 1954 SC 415 : (1955) 1 SCR 408 : F 1954 SCJ 600 : 1954 Cri LJ 1029] the police in India seized goods in possession of the petitioner in India at the instance of the police of the State of Jammu & Kashmir. The seizure was admittedly not under the authority of law, inasmuch as it was not under the s of any Magistrate; nor was it under Sections 51, 96, 98 and G 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, since no report of any offence committed by the petitioner was made to the police in India, and the Indian police were not authorised to make any investigation. In those circumstances, the Court held that the seizure was not with the authority of law and amounted to an infringement H 67 (1982) 1 SCC 39 ASSOCIATION OF VASANTH APARTMENTS’ OWNERS v. 1141 V. GOPINATH & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] of the fundamental right under Article 31(1). The view was A reaffirmed in Bishan Das case [AIR 1961 SC 1570 : (1962) 2 SCR 69 : (1963) 1 SCJ 405].” 141. What this Court in K.T. Plantations (supra) meant was to distinguish ‘law’ as a legislative measure as distinct from mere Executive fiat. B 142. The intention of Parliament was to do away with the Fundamental Right to acquire, hold and dispose of property (See paragraph-179). Deprivation of property must take place for public purpose primarily (See paragraph-180). Public purpose must be given an expansive meaning(See paragraph-181). Payment of compensation C isa constitutional requirement under Article 30(1)(A) and under the second proviso to Article 31(A)(1) unlike Article 300A. After the Forty- FourthAmendment, the constitutional obligation to pay compensation to a person deprived of his property is dependent on the Statute. (See para 183). We may refer to the following observations in paragraph 188: “188. We find no apparent conflict with the words used in List III D Entry 42 so as to infer that the payment of compensation is inbuilt or inherent either in the words “acquisition and requisitioning” under List III Entry 42. Right to claim compensation, therefore, cannot be read into the legislative List III Entry 42.” 143. This would mean that the argument of the parties, based on E the impugned provisions being violative of Article 254 of the Constitution, is untenable. We may equally notice paragraph-189: “189. Requirement of public purpose, for deprivation of a person of his property under Article 300-A, is a precondition, but no compensation or nil compensation or its illusiveness has to be F justified by the State on judicially justiciable standards.
