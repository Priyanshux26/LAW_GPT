STATE OF GUJARAT AND ORS. v. JAYANTIBHAI 709 ISHWARBHAI PATEL [M. R. SHAH, J.] 366.5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation A as provided under Section 31(1) of the 1894 Act, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed under Section 24(2) due to non-payment or non-deposit of compensation in court. The obligation to pay is complete by tendering the amount under Section 31(1). The landowners who had refused to accept compensation B or who sought reference for higher compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act. 366.6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act is to be treated as part of Section 24(2), not part of Section 24(1)(b). C 366.7. The mode of taking possession under the 1894 Act and as contemplated under Section 24(2) is by drawing of inquest report/memorandum. Once award has been passed on taking possession under Section 16 of the 1894 Act, the land vests in State there is no divesting provided under Section 24(2) of the D 2013 Act, as once possession has been taken there is no lapse under Section 24(2). 366.8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are applicable in case authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for E five years or more before the 2013 Act came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending with the authority concerned as on 1-1-2014. The period of subsistence of interim s passed by court has to be excluded in the computation of five years. 366.9. Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of concluded proceedings F of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of enforcement of the 2013 Act i.e. 1-1-2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of G compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.” 5.4 Therefore, as per the law laid down by this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority (Supra), taking over the possession of the land by drawing panchnama is held to be legally permissible and H 710 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A can be said to be taking over the possession legally. In the present case, there was a consent award under Section 11 of the Act, 1894. The possession was taken by drawing the panchnama at the time of passing of the consent award dated 11.06.1993. However, thereafter, because of the reluctance on the part of the land owner, he did not actually and physically hand over the possession and he continued to cultivate the B acquired land which actually vested in the State Government / Acquiring Body / Sardar Sarovar Rehabilitation Agency. 6.
