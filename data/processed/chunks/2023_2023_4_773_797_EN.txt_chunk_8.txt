Section 16-B of the HPGST Act had come into force with effect from 21st October, 1994 whereas the consent decree was passed in favour of PNB on 12th November, 1998. This being the position, the provisions of section 16-B of the HPGST Act would apply and that PNB was not entitled to G any relief.

A is parimateria with section 16-B of the HPGST Act, creating a first charge on the property of the dealer.
