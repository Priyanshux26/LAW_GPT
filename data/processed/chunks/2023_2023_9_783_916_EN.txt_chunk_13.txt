Two equity shareholders of the corporate debtor challenged the aforesaid of the Tribunal before the Appellate Tribunal in Company Appeal (AT)(CH)(Ins.) Nos. 19 of 2021 and 20 of 2021 but, B the appeals were dismissed on 05.05.2021 with the following observations19: - “33. …..In the instant case, even though we find that Regulation 30-C could have been applied for exclusion of 179 days on account of the unprecedented situation created by the Covid 19 pandemic C and some of the Financial Creditors opined for fresh publication of form G for the invitation of EOI. But the COC had unanimously decided only for seeking exclusion of 179 days, i.e. from 5 May 2020 to 31 October 2020, for completion of CIRP. But the CoC, under its commercial wisdom, did not prefer for publication of Form-G afresh to invite Expression of Interest. Therefore such a D decision of the CoC is not justiciable. 34. In the circumstances stated above, we are of the considered opinion that the decision taken by the Adjudicating Authority needs no interference, and both the Appeals deserves to be dismissed.” 12.10.
