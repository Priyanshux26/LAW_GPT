No. 1651 of 1994 with a prayer to restrain A. Valliammai from dealing with the Suit Property. Decree for specifi c performance of the agreement to sale (Exhibit A-1) was not prayed. It appears that an interim injunction was not granted. 14. On 02.05.1995, A. Valliammai sold 5 acres, a portion of the Suit Property, for a sale consideration of Rs.7,50,000/- to B. Namichand Jain and three others. The purchasers were put in possession and enjoyment of such portions of the Suit Property. 15.

No. 1126 of 1995, subsequently renumbered as O.S. No. 21 of 2004. The present appeal arises from the and decree of the trial court in the said suit, affi rmed subsequently by the High Court in the impugned . 190 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 16. The suit was defended by A. Valliammai on several grounds, including, inter alia, constructive res judicata, bar under II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908,6 bar of limitation, failure to show readiness and willingness to perform the agreement to sell (Exhibit A-1) and invalidity of the assignment agreement (Exhibit A-2). 17. The trial court framed one issue, that is, whether the plaintiff s were entitled to the relief of specifi c performance. Trial court held that the execution of the agreement to sell (Exhibit A-1) and its extension by six months vide the endorsement (Exhibit A-3) were admitted. A. Valliammai had not led evidence regarding allotment of land to the Trust on the eastward side or her willingness to refund the advance amount. Further, K. Sriram was not aware of the status of partition suit in O.S. No. 787 of 1985. In terms of VIII, Rules 4 and 5 of the Code, A. Valliammai had not denied her intention to complete the agreement to sell (Exhibit A-1). K.P. Murali and S.P. Duraisamy had awaited the conclusion of the partition suit in O.S. No. 787 of 1985. Therefore the limitation period had not commenced till the disposal of the said partition suit on 30.04.1993. Correspondingly, the plea of res judicata was rejected since the decision to not fi le the suit of specifi c performance was considered to be bona-fi de. K. Sriram was ready and willing to perform the agreement to sell (Exhibit A-1) since he had taken steps to divide the Suit Property into housing plots. The contention that the assignment agreement (Exhibit A-2) would not confer any rights to K.P. Murali and S.P. Duraisamy was rejected. 18. The High Court in the impugned rejected the pleas of res judicata or bar under II, Rule 2 of the Code in view of the pendency of the partition suit in O.S.
