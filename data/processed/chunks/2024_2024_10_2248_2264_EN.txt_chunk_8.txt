Digital Supreme Court Reports failure to prove would result in dismissal of his complaint case. Thereafter, the presumption under Section 139 does not again come to the complainant’s rescue. Once both parties have adduced evidence, the Court has to consider the same and the burden of proof loses all its importance. [Basalingappa v. Mudibasappa [Basalingappa v. Mudibasappa, (2019) 5 SCC 418: (2019) 2 SCC (Cri) 571: AIR 2019 SC 1983]; see also, Rangappa v. Sri Mohan [Rangappa v. Sri Mohan, (2010) 11 SCC 441: (2010) 4 SCC (Civ) 477: (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 184: AIR 2010 SC 1898]]’ (emphasis supplied) 13. For reasons aforesaid, we do not find any ground to interfere in the impugned and accordingly, the petition(s) shall stand dismissed. We refuse special leave, being cognizant of Rafiq v State of Uttar Pradesh (1980) 4 SCC 262: ‘3. Concurrent findings of fact ordinarily acquire a deterrent sanctity and tentative finality when challenged in this Court and we rarely invoke the special jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution which is meant mainly to correct manifest injustice or errors of law of great moment. …’ (emphasis supplied) 14. However, before parting, the Court would clarify that though there are separate s and s of the Trial Court, in each case, six months’ simple imprisonment and direction to pay the cheque amount as the compensation has been awarded; the s being of the same date between the same parties and in connection with the same transaction of the same nature, albeit in different tranches, the sentences of imprisonment awarded shall run concurrently. Further, in case of failure of the petitioners to pay the compensation amount within six months from today, the same shall be recovered from them as a public debt under the relevant law, and it shall be paid to the complainant/respondent by the competent authority post-recovery. In directing the sentences to run concurrently, we have exercised judicial discretion [reference to ‘judicial discretion’ herein is to be understood as per Gudikanti Narasimhulu v Public Prosecutor, [2025] 4 S.C.R. 2261 State (NCT) of Delhi v. Rajeev Sharma High Court of Andhra Pradesh (1978) 1 SCC 240] guided by the principles governing the field, which are noted infra: I. Mohd. Akhtar Hussain v Assistant Collector of Customs (Prevention) (1988) 4 SCC 183 [2-Judge Bench] ‘10. The basic rule of thumb over the years has been the so-called single transaction rule for concurrent sentences. If a given transaction constitutes two offences under two enactments generally, it is wrong to have consecutive sentences. It is proper and legitimate to have concurrent sentences. But this rule has no application if the transaction relating to offences is not the same or the facts constituting the two offences are quite different.’ (emphasis supplied) II. V K Bansal v State of Haryana (2013) 7 SCC 211 [2-Judge Bench] ‘18. Applying the principle of single transaction referred to above to the above fact situations we are of the view that each one of the loan transactions/financial arrangements was a separate and distinct transaction between the complainant on the one hand and the borrowing company/ appellant on the other.
