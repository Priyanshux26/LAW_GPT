The person must have resided in India for a minimum of six months before the application. Thus, the proviso covers those who remigrated to India between 1 March 1947 and 26 July 1949. 24. The distinction between Article 6 and Article 7 is that the former provision does not specifically refer to the permit system while the latter does. Though the significance of the date 19 July 1948 is traceable to the permit system, Article 6 does not mandate that citizenship would be granted only if the person entered the Indian territory on a permit. As opposed to this, Article 7 provides citizenship 34 Yasmin Khan, The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan (Penguin India) 168 35 See Kulathil v. State of Kerala, AIR 1966 SC 1614 [Justice Shah, 32] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1255 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 only to those who entered India through a valid permit. Article 7, like Article 6 is temporary in nature because (a) persons covered by the proviso to Article 7 must have registered as a citizen under Article 6(ii)(b) which prescribes a time limit; and (b) the guarantee is dependent on a parliamentary legislation (that is, the permit must be issued under authority of law) which itself indicates that it is not a permanent code. 25. The legislation(s) which introduced the permit system must be referred to understand the scope of the proviso to Article 7. On 26 July 1949, the Governor General promulgated the Influx from West Pakistan (Control) Ordinance 1948. The Ordinance stipulated that persons can enter India from any place in West Pakistan only if they are in possession of permits. ‘Permit’ was defined as a permit for the time being in force issued or renewed by the prescribed authority after satisfying the described conditions relating to the class of permits to which it belongs.36 The Central Government was conferred the power to issue rules, inter alia, prescribing the authorities by whom permits may be issued or renewed and the conditions to be satisfied for such permits. It is crucial to note that the Ordinance only applied to the influx from the part of Pakistan which lies to the west of India (that is, the present day Pakistan).37 It did not apply to migrants from East Pakistan (that is, present day Bangladesh). On 7 September 1948, the Government of India in exercise of its power under the West Pakistan Ordinance issued rules for the implementation of the permit system. The rules introduced three kinds of permits: the permit for temporary visits, the permit for resettlement or permanent return and the permanent permit. The proviso to Article 7 only covers those who remigrated to India under the resettlement or permanent return permit.38 26. On 10 November 1948, the Governor General promulgated the Influx from Pakistan (Control) Ordinance 1948 by which a permit system 36 West Pakistan (Control) Ordinance 1948, Section 2(c) 37 West Pakistan (Control) Ordinance 1948, Section 3(2) 38 See Speech by Dr BR Ambedkar and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the Constituent Assembly on 12 August 1949: [Nehru]“There are three types of permits, I am told.
