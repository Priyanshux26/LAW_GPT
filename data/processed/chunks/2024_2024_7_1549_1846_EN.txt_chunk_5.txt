[Paras 33, 34] Mines and Minerals – Dead rent – Explanation: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI) (for himself and for Hrishikesh Roy, Abhay S Oka, J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, Satish Chandra Sharma and Augustine George Masih, JJ.) Dead rent acts as a deterrent against a leaseholder cornering a mining lease and keeping the mineral resources idle – Similar to royalty, dead rent is also a statutory imposition and an integral part of the mining lease, but it generally does not serve as a consideration for the removal or consumption of minerals – Dead rent is determined on the basis of the area of land covered by the lease – Imposition of dead rent ensures that the proprietor obtains a fixed rent from the lessee even if the mine remains unworked – Thus, dead rent is not in addition to royalty but an alternative – Principles applicable to royalty apply to dead rent because dead rent is imposed in the exercise 1556 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the proprietary right (and not a sovereign right) by the lessor to ensure that the lessee works the mine, and does not keep it idle, and in a situation where the lessee keeps the mine idle, it ensures a constant flow of income to the proprietor; the liability to pay dead rent flows from the terms of the mining lease; dead rent is an alternate to royalty; if the rates of royalty are higher than dead rent, the lessee is required to pay the former and not the latter; and the Central Government prescribes the dead rent not in the exercise of its sovereign right, but as a regulatory measure to ensure uniformity of rates. [Paras 99, 129] – Held: (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.) Entry 49 List II does not apply to mineral bearing lands as such lands are taxed in the form of royalty or dead rent in the context of exercise of mineral rights – Exercise of mineral rights is the basis for payment of royalty or dead rent – Insofar as extraction of minerals is concerned, being an exercise of a mineral right, royalty is payable by a holder of a mining lease and when no mining activity is carried on, dead rent is payable by such a person. [Paras 33, 41] Constitution of India – Federalism – Explanation – Distinctive elements: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI) (for himself and for Hrishikesh Roy, Abhay S Oka, J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, Satish Chandra Sharma and Augustine George Masih, JJ.) Federalism is one of the basic features of the Constitution which embodies a division of powers between the units of the federation-the Union and the States – Indian federalism is defined as asymmetric because it tilts towards the Centre, producing a strong Central Government – Yet, it has not necessarily resulted in weak State governments – Indian States are sovereigns within the legislative competence assigned to them – Delicate balance of power is secured by constitutional courts by interpreting the scheme of distribution of powers – In a federal form of government, each federal unit should be able to perform its core constitutional functions with a certain degree of independence – Constitution has to be interpreted in a manner which does not dilute the federal character of our constitutional scheme – Effort of the constitutional court should be to ensure that State legislatures are not subordinated to the Union in the areas exclusively reserved for them.
