VI. Analysis and Findings 38. The AA scheme is a duty exemption scheme introduced by G the Union, under the FTP. Under the scheme, exemption from the payment of import duties is given to raw materials / inputs required for the 24 2006 Supp (6) SCR417. 25 2006 Supp (9) SCR 565. 26 1962 (2) SCR 169 H UNION OF INDIA AND ORS. v. COSMO FILMS LIMITED 209 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] manufacture of export products i.e., one can import raw materials or A inputs at zero customs duty for production of export products. The purpose of this scheme is to ensure competitiveness of India’s products in the global market. When duties paid on raw materials are saved, it reduces the cost of the final export product. In terms of the scheme, the exporter can import raw materials duty-free.27 These inputs either can B be in a raw / natural / unrefined / unmanufactured or manufactured state. Advance Licenses are issued to allow duty-free import of inputs, which are then physically incorporated in export goods (after making normal allowance for wastage). In addition to this, fuel, oil, the catalyst which is consumed / utilized in the process of production of export product, may also be allowed. Imports under an AA were exempted from the C payment of Basic Customs Duty (BCD), Additional Customs Duty, Education Cess, Anti-dumping Duty, Countervailing Duty (CVD), Safeguard Duty, and Transition Product Specific Safeguard Duty, wherever applicable. 39. The principal challenge before the High Court, was to the D ‘pre-import condition’ in paragraph 4.14 of FTP inserted by Notification No. 33/2015-2020 dated 13.10.2017 and the ‘pre-import condition’ introduced by clause (xii) in Notification No. 18/2015-Cus dated 01.04.2015 by Notification 79/2017-Customs dated 13.10.2017. 40. Chapter IV of the FTP provides for “Duty Exemption/ E Remission Schemes”. One of the duty exemption schemes is the AA. Paragraph 4.03 of the policy makes provision for AA and reads thus: “4.03 Advance Authorisation (a) Advance Authorisation is issued to allow duty free import of input, which is physically incorporated in export product F (making normal allowance for wastage). In addition, fuel, oil, catalyst which is consumed/utilized in the process of production of export product, may also be allowed. (b) Advance Authorisation is issued for inputs in relation to resultant product, on the following basis: G (i) As per Standard Input Output Norms (SION) notified (available in Hand Book of Procedures); 27 As per Chapter 9 of FTP paragraph 9.44, “Raw material” is input(s) required for manufacturing of goods. H 210 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A OR (ii) On the basis of self declaration as per paragraph 4.07 of Handbook of Procedures.”28 41. The other relevant provisions of the FTP for purposes of this case, are paragraphs 4.13, 4.14 and 4.16, which, as they stood at the B relevant time when FTP 2015-2020 was introduced, read as follows: “4.13 “pre-import condition” in certain cases (i) DGFT may, by Notification, impose “pre-import condition” for inputs under this Chapter. (ii) Import items subject to “pre-import condition” are listed C in Appendix 4-J or will be as indicated in Standard Input Output Norms (SION).
