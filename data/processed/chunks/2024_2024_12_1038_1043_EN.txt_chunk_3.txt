Indore Development Authority to handover the possession of the plot to the writ petitioner i.e. respondent herein. However, only a sum of Rs. 5,72,782/- through a demand draft was presented in the month of September, 2006, against the total outstanding dues of Rs. 12,02,592/-. 10. The appellant i.e. Indore Development Authority has shown magnanimity in the matter by reducing the interest vide letter dated 17.02.2009 and the amount was reduced to Rs. 11,04,948/- which was required to be paid on or before 28.02.2009. The respondent, not being satisfied even with the reduction of amount, opted for a different route for redressal of his grievance by approaching the District Forum and the District Forum was justified in dismissing the complaint of the respondent. The respondent again approached the High Court by way of a writ petition which was dismissed as withdrawn on 08.04.2015 with the liberty to avail statutory remedy provided under the Consumer Protection Act and thereafter the respondent preferred an appeal before the State Commission against the passed by the District Forum. The State Commission by way of an interim dated 15.12.2017 directed the appellant i.e. Indore Development Authority to accept the outstanding amount with interest [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1043 Indore Development Authority v. Dr. Hemant Mandovra and to deliver the possession of plot in question to the respondent, meaning thereby, a final relief was granted by way of an interim and under these circumstances, the matter had reached the National Commission. In the considered opinion of this Court, final relief could not have been granted by the State Commission on an interlocutory application filed in the matter. 11. The other important aspect of the case is that the National Commission without considering any ground raised by the appellant has directed the appellant to receive and accept the amount from the respondent along with interest and handover the possession of the plot in question. In our considered opinion, in respect of NIT/advertisement issued on 05.10.1994, no such could have been passed by the National Commission in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case i.e. after a lapse of period of 28 years. It was the respondent who committed default in depositing the balance amount as per the terms and conditions of the NIT and even after the first round of litigation before the High Court, the respondent did not deposit the amount of Rs. 12,02,592/- which was outstanding against him and, therefore, at this juncture, after a lapse of 28 years, the question of directing the appellant i.e. Indore Development Authority as has been done by the National Commission to accept the amount does not arise. Resultantly, the s passed by the State Commission dt. 15.12.2017 and National Commission dt. 29.03.2023 deserve to be set aside and are accordingly set aside and it is made clear that the appellant i.e. Indore Development Authority shall issue a fresh tender in respect of the said plot in question and shall allot the plot only by way of auction or by following the due process as per rules.
