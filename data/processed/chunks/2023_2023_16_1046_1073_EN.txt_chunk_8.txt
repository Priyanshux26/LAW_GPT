Only clause (2) in Rule 9(1)(a) fi nds the mention of a date (1st day of November immediately preceding the date of submission of names by the concerned authority) as such. Therefore, the fi nding that the rule itself clearly provides for a cut-off date qua all the clauses in Rule 9(1)(a) appears to be perverse and without any basis. The Ld. Single Judge has rightly relied on the letter date 09.07.2019 in arriving at the conclusion that 01.11.2018 was the cut-off date only for a limited purpose. That limited purpose can be understood if one were to read the clarifi cation provided for in the said letter. The clarifi cation is extracted herein below for easy reference: - “2. The State Government has re-considered the matter and it has been decided that the DROs/Tehsildars whose names are to be recommended should fulfi l the following conditions of eligibility:- (a) (i) has completed eight years continuous Government Service. (ii) has not attained the age of fi fty years as on 01.11.2018. (iii) is not facing disciplinary proceedings and against whom action is not being contemplated; and 105 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. (iv) is clear from vigilance angle; (b) is a graduate from a recognised University. It is clarifi ed for the condition (a) (i) that services rendered as Naib Tehsildars shall not to be included while determining the eligibility as per interim s/directions dated 26.04.2017 of Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana Chandigarh passed in CWP No. 8502 of 2017- Joginder Sharma and others versus State of Haryana and others. It is further clarifi ed that DROs/Tehsildars, who are otherwise eligible being less than 50 years of age on and after 01.11.2018, their ACRs be considered upto year 2018-2019 and experience be taken into consideration upto the date of recommendation. The DROs/ Tehsildars, who had not attained the age of 50 years as on 01.11.2018 but attained the age of more than 50 years on and after 01.11.2018 till the date of recommendation their experience and ACRs record be considered only upto 01.11.2018. However, pending disciplinary proceedings, vigilance clearance and integrity be considered upto the date of consideration in both cases.” 28. From this clarifi catory note, it becomes clear that if a candidate was less than 50 years of age as on 01.11.2018 and continued to be so till the date of recommendation, then his ACR and experience was to be counted till the date of recommendation. However, if the candidate was less than fi fty years as on 01.11.2018 but exceeded such age as on the date of recommendation, such candidates ACR and experience was to be accounted for only till 01.11.2018. In that sense, the cut-off date (01.11.2018) was relevant only to decide the question of how much of the ACR and experience had to be considered and till what period. Such date was never meant to operate as the date against which all the eligibility criteria had to be measured against. This fact stands clarifi ed from the last paragraph of the letter dated 09.07.2019, whereunder it has been stated that the eligibility criteria concerning ‘pending disciplinary proceedings, vigilance clearance and integrity’ was to be considered up to the date of consideration in both cases.
