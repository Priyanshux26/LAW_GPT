The evidence of last seen, only leads upto a point and no further. It fails to link it further to make a complete chain. All this court have here is the evidence of last seen, which as this court have seen looses much H 224 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A of its weight under the circumstances of the case, due to the long duration of time between last seen and the possible time of death. What this court can call as discovery here under Section 27 of the Act, is the discovery of ‘Parna’ and watch of the deceased. This evidence in itself is not sufficient to fix guilt on the appellant. In a case where there is no direct eye witness to the crime, the B prosecution has to build its case on the circumstantial evidence. It is a very heavy burden cast on the prosecution. The chain of circumstances collected by the prosecution must complete the chain, which should point to only one conclusion which is that it is the accused who had committed the crime, and none else. Each C evidence which completes the chain of evidences must stand on firm grounds. In the considered opinion of this Court, the evidence placed by the prosecution in this case does not pass muster the standard required in a case of circumstantial evidence.
