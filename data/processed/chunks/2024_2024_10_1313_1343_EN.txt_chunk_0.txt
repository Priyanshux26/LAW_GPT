Mahadevan, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the High Court was justified in reversing the of the trial court and acquitting the respondents of the charges punishable under Sections 302, 307, 333, 355 and 379, all read with Section 34 of the Penal Code, 1860, and Section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959. Headnotes† Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 307, read with s.34 – Murder of an MLA and his bodyguard – Respondents convicted by Trial Court – Conviction reversed by High Court – Challenge to: Held: In view of the evidence and materials on record, charges against A-4 and A-8 under Section 302 read with Section 34 and Section 307 r/w Section 34 proved and established beyond reasonable doubt – Conviction and sentence awarded by the trial court affirmed and restored – However, benefit of doubt given to other accused persons as there is no direct ocular evidence implicating them and the charge of conspiracy is not substantiated, their acquittal upheld – Impugned set aside. [Paras 42-45] FIR – Delay in forwarding the copy to magistrate – When not fatal: Held: The incident took place in the night of 13.06.1998 – 14.06.1998 being a Sunday, the FIR was forwarded to the jurisdictional magistrate on 15.06.1998 – Thus, the delay in forwarding the copy of the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate was explained – Mere delay by itself is not sufficient to discard and disbelieve the case of the prosecution unless the accused demonstrate how this delay has prejudiced their case – If the investigation starts in right earnest and there is sufficient material on record to show that the accused were named and pinpointed, *Author 1314 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the prosecution case can be accepted when evidence implicates the accused – The requirement to dispatch and serve a copy of the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate is an external check against ante dating or ante timing of the FIR to ensure that there is no manipulation or interpolation in the FIR – Further, if the court finds the witnesses to be truthful and credible, the lack of a cogent explanation for the delay may not be regarded as detrimental. [Para 30] Evidence – Non-recovery of vehicles and weapons used in the offence – Effect on credibility of eyewitnesses, if any: Held: The ocular version of the witnesses should not be disregarded solely because the weapon used in the crime and the vehicles allegedly used by the accused were not located or seized by the police – On facts, the failure of the police to recover the vehicles and the weapons is not sufficient to undermine the credibility of the eyewitness accounts or the corroborative evidence regarding the cause of the homicidal deaths of both the deceased. [Para 27] Evidence – Witness with criminal background – Courts to exercise caution but, evidence cannot be discarded merely on the ground of criminal background: Held: Criminal background of a witness necessitates that the courts approach their evidence with caution – The testimony of a witness with a chequered past cannot be dismissed as untruthful or uncreditworthy without considering the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, including their presence at the scene of the offence – In cases involving conflicts between rival gangs or groups, the testimony of members from either side is admissible and relevant – If the court is convinced of the veracity and truthfulness of such testimony, it may be considered – Courts assess the broader context to determine if there is sufficient corroboration, as long as there are no valid reasons to discredit the evidence – The crucial test is whether the witness is truly an eyewitness and whether their testimony is credible – If their presence at the scene is established beyond doubt, their account of the incident can be relied upon – Such evidence cannot be discarded merely on the grounds of criminal background.
