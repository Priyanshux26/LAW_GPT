If the information relates to the protected class, the claim is allowed irrespective of the effect of non-disclosure on the case and E broader constitutional principles; and thirdly, the burden of proof is on the affected party to prove its case with non-privileged evidence and not on the State to prove the necessity of non-disclosure. H. 4 Canada 131. Similar to the Courts in the United Kingdom, the Canadian F jurisprudence on non-disclosure of information has shifted away from ‘class’ scrutiny towards the scrutiny of individual documents.100 The consistent view of the Canadian Courts has been that the documents maybe withheld only ‘for the proper functioning of the executive branch and not to facilitate its improper conduct’.101 G 132. Section 38 of the Canada Evidence Act 1985 stipulates the conditions for disclosure of information that is sought to be protected. 99 614 F 3d 1070 (9th Cir 2010) (United States) 100 Carey v. Majesty, (1986), 72 N.R 81 (SCC) H 101 Ibid. MADHYAMAM BROADCASTING LIMITED v. UNION OF 689 INDIA & ORS. [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] The Court undertakes the following analysis to determine the validity of A the claim of non-disclosure filed by the Attorney General of Canada: (i) The relevancy test: Whether the information sought to be disclosed is relevant to the case. The burden of proof to prove relevancy of the information is on the party claiming disclosure102; B (ii) The injury test: Whether the disclosure would be injurious to international relations, national defence or national security.103 The burden of proving injury due to disclosure is on the party opposing disclosure.104 The Court must assess if the executive’s claim of injury has a factual basis. The court at C this stage must consider the nature of the information, and the nature of the injury that is sought to be protected; (a) The Court should disclosure if the State is unable to discharge its burden of proving it to the court that the disclosure of information is injurious; and D (b) The court must undertake a balancing exercise if the State has proved that the disclosure would be injurious to national security; (iii)The alternative test: Whether there are alternatives to full disclosure that would protect a fair trial. E (iv)The balancing test: The Court must determine if public interest in disclosure outweighs public interest in non-disclosure105. If it does, then the information must be disclosed. The Court must consider the following factors while undertaking the balancing exercise106: F (a) The ‘relative importance’ of the information in proving or defending the claim- that is, whether the information is ‘necessary’ and ‘crucial’ to the case; (b) the extent of injury that would be caused by the disclosure; G 102 Ribic v.
