The SFIO cannot avoid the consequences of not having filed an affidavit, stating on oath, that C the investigation was not complete. This is a question of fact; xv) Section 212(12), does not permit initiation of prosecution based on a report which is issued till such time investigation has been completed. This is clear from a conjoint reading of Sections 212(12), (14) and (15). Further, though Section 173(8) of the CrPC D contemplates a further investigation after filing of a report under Section 173(2), it is trite that Section 173(8) does not enable the inspector to submit an incomplete or preliminary report and later on submit a final report. Reliance is placed on the following decisions in the cases of Kamal Lochan Sen v. State of Orissa (1982) 54 CLT 509 (Para 5) and AV Dharma Reddy v. State of E A.P. & Ors., 2011 CriLJ 185 (Para 5). Therefore, the stratagem adopted by SFIO and the Ministry in proceeding to act based on an “interim report” and simultaneously carrying on a further investigation is illegal; xvi) Since the investigation itself was not complete and the 2nd F Interim SFIO Report is merely an interim report, there was no basis for the Ministry to issue a direction under Section 212(14) to initiate prosecution. Accordingly, the Sanction is ultra yes. It does not constitute sanction and the prosecution is void ab initio and a nullity; G xvii) The Sanction was passed without application of mind to the relevant material and evidence; xviii) Section 212(14) requires an “examination” by the Central Government and even contemplates “legal advice” being taken, if required. The Parliament sets out a superior degree of care that H 1002 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A is required while passing an under Section 212(14). Therefore, the Central Government’s decision must be reasoned and must be made with proper application of mind; xix) In law, the of sanction must disclose both adequacy of material as well as consideration of the relevant facts, material B and evidence by the sanctioning authority. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Mansukhbhai Vithaldas Chauhan v. State of Gujarat (1997) 7 SCC 622 (Paras 17, 18 and 19); xx) SFIO submitted the 2nd Interim SFIO Report on 28.05.2019. C Admittedly, the report comprised of over 32,000 pages, with the body of the report itself forming approximately 787 pages. The 2 Interim SFIO Report was allegedly examined by a Processing Officer (Legal Section), Ministry who had prepared a processing note. This processing note was allegedly submitted to the ‘Senior Officer’ on an urgent priority basis. Despite the above internal D processes, Ministry issued the Sanction on 29.05.2019 (i.e., within one day). It is pertinent to note that a copy of the said processing note was not placed before the Bombay High Court or provided to BSR despite repeated requests for inspection vide emails dated 01.10.2019, 10.10.2019, and 14.10.2019. The Bombay E High Court, in these circumstances, was correct to draw adverse inference since Ministry and SFIO failed to demonstrate due application of mind through any document or affidavit; xxi) Given the voluminous nature of the 2nd Interim SFIO Report and the internal processes in place, it was impossible for Ministry to examine and apply its mind to the 2nd Interim SFIO Report (as F required under Section 212(14) of the Act) within one day before it issued the Sanction .
