In Allahabad High Court Bar Association v. State of Uttar Pradesh,139 a Constitution Bench laid down the following parameters for the exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 142: “27.1. The jurisdiction can be exercised to do complete justice between the parties before the Court. It cannot be exercised to nullify the benefits derived by a large number of litigants based on judicial s validly passed in their favour who are not parties to the proceedings before this Court; 27.2. Article 142 does not empower this Court to ignore the substantive rights of the litigants; and 27.3. While exercising the jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, this Court can always issue procedural directions to the courts for streamlining procedural aspects and ironing out the creases in the procedural laws to ensure expeditious and timely disposal of cases. This is because, while exercising the jurisdiction under Article 142, this Court may not be bound by procedural requirements of law.
