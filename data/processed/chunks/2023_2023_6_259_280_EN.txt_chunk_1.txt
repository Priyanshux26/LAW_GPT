The difficulty in accepting the revenue’s argument, in this case, is that it jumps over interpretive instructions. One, General Note (1) states that classification has to be in consonance with terms and headings in chapter notes. Two, Rule 3 (a) categorically enjoins that in regard to classification, the heading providing for a “more” specific E description prevails over the general one. Three, Note 1 (m) – in Chapter 85 excludes the application of articles falling in Chapter 90. In this court’s opinion, this note, along with the General Note 3 (a) [of the General Rules of Interpretation] that headings that are specifically provided, should be preferred over the general F ones, is decisive. Thus, the revenue’s contention that by virtue of Note 2 (b) to Chapter 85, the goods are to be classified based on their principal or sole use is insubstantial because of the clear mandate of Note 1 (m), which excludes Chapter 90 goods (which includes LCD panels). More importantly, Note 2 opens with the expression “subject to Note 1”. This subordinates the entire G subject matter in Note 2; it is only where the article is a “part” which acts as an accessory, that the enumerated portions of Chapter 85 come into play. Such an interpretation is plainly untenable. [Paras 23, 25][273-D-E; 274-D-G] H CCE, AURANGABAD v. M/S VIDEOCON INDUSTRIES LTD. 261 THR. ITS DIRECTOR Commissioner of Central Excise, Delhi-III v. UNI A Products India Ltd. (2020) 19 SCC 742 : [2020] 13 SCR 295 – relied on. 1.3 When goods are excluded from a particular chapter, the “pull in” through a note has to be narrowly construed, as B otherwise, the basis of exclusion would be defeated, and the earlier note (of exclusion) rendered redundant. Finally, Secure Meters is decisive on the question that LCDs are not articles provided “more specifically in other headings”, i.e., other than 90.13. Furthermore, the fact that LCDs could be used for purposes other than television sets or audio sets is also concluded because, C in that decision, its use in meters was in issue.
