The suit was initially decreed on 30.10.2010. After the lease expired on 31.12.1997, from January 1998 onwards the appellants were in occupation of the property in dispute without paying any damages for use and occupation thereof. The respondent-plaintiff fi led a suit in January 2020 seeking a direction to the appellants-defendants to pay liquidated damages of ₹1,28,90,000/- along with interest @ 12% per annum from 01.01.1998 till realization. Future damages @ ₹30,50,000/- per month from 01.01.2020 till the date of handing over vacant possession of the property in dispute were also claimed. The calculation was on a very conservative estimate, the details whereof have been furnished in the suit. As there was huge delay on the part of the appellants to pay the damages for use and occupation of the property in dispute, interest was also claimed. As had been the attitude of the appellants in delaying the process of law, instead of defending the suit which otherwise was not defendable, an application was fi led under VII Rule 11(d) C.P.C. for rejection of the plaint. The same was totally mis-conceived. There is no bar in fi ling a separate suit for claiming damages for use and occupation of the property in dispute, in case in the fi rst suit pertaining to the same premises, only possession was claimed. The law thereon is well settled. Even the High Court has also referred to the s starting from a Full Bench of Madras High Court in Ponnammal v. Ramamirda Aiyar and two others5. Subsequently, the matter was considered by the 4 (2013) 1 SCC 625 5 ILR (1915) XXXVIII 829 864 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. Full Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court in Sadhu Singh etc. v. Pritam Singh, Etc.6 Same view was endorsed. Even this Court in Gurbux Singh v. Bhooralal7 had settled the issue that even if damages for use and occupation had not been claimed in a suit fi led earlier seeking possession of the property, a fresh suit being a distinct cause of action is maintainable. In view of the aforesaid settled position of law, the subsequent suit fi led by the respondent-plaintiff cannot be said to be barred under any law. It was further submitted that the issue with regard to maintainability of the suit in terms of II Rule 2 C.P.C. has already been framed and the matter will be examined by the Trial Court after the parties lead evidence. Even if the appellants-defendants had any objection with regard to any part of the claim made in the suit being beyond limitation or otherwise, the issue can always be raised and tried. 8. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the paper book. 9. The respondent-plaintiff is the absolute owner of the property in dispute. It was originally owned by T. Padmanabhan, T. Sethuraman and T. Gopinath. At that time, M/s Burma Shell Oil Storage and Distribution Company of India Ltd. had taken the property on lease with eff ect from 01.01.1958 for a period of twenty years by executing a lease deed dated 08.01.1958.
