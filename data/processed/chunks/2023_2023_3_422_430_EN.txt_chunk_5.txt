Thus, the split of 70:30 under the arbitration award must be given effect, having H attained finality. PARSVNATH DEVELOPERS LTD. v. GAGANDEEP BRAR AND 429 ANOTHER [M. R. SHAH, J.] 13. In any case, we find that such division is well-founded as the A sale proceeds from the flat buyers were apportioned in the 16 same ratio of 70:30 between the Developer and CHB. This is supported by the Escrow Agreement dated 01.06.2007 executed by CHB and the Developer in pursuance of the Development Agreement dated 06.10.2006. Clause 4(b) of this Escrow B Agreement provides that 30% of the sale proceeds in respect of the residential units would first be transferred to CHB, and the remaining amount shall then be transferred to the Developer. In view of this, we find that the amount directed to be paid by the National Commission in the impugned must be paid by the Developer and CHB in the ratio of 70:30.” C 7. In view of the above both, the State Commission as well as the National Commission have seriously erred in fastening the entire liability to pay compensation solely upon the appellant – developer. The compensation in terms of clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyer Agreement is to be shared between the developer and the CHB in the ratio of 70:30 as D apportioned/determined by the learned sole arbitrator in the award dated 09.01.2015 and thereafter as observed by this Court while disposing of/ dismissing Civil Appeal No. 10748/2016. 8. In view of the above, the impugned s passed by the National Commission and that of the State Commission are required to be modified E to the extent holding the appellant – developer liable to pay compensation under clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyer Agreement to the extent of 70% and 30% liability would be upon the Chandigarh Housing Board. The present appeals preferred by the appellant – developer are to be allowed to the aforesaid extent and the appeals preferred by the CHB are required to F be disposed of in terms of the above. 9. Accordingly, in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the appeals preferred by the Developer – Parsvnath Developers Limited are hereby partly allowed. The impugned common and dated 05.02.2020 passed by the National Commission in Appeal G Execution No. 4/2016 and other connected Appeal Executions is hereby modified to the extent holding the appellant – developer liable to pay compensation to the respective allottees/buyers/original complainants to the extent of 70% and the liability to pay balance 30% of the compensation in terms of clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyer Agreement would be upon Chandigarh Housing Board.
