In a suit for possession, the plaintiff must stand on the strength of their own title. The appellants cite precedents to emphasize that the weakness of the defendant’s case cannot be a ground for granting relief to the plaintiffs. (iii). Adverse Possession and Limitation: While acknowledging that the State cannot claim adverse possession against a private individual, the appellants maintain that they have been in continuous, peaceful possession of the suit land since 1879. Under Section 110 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, such possession raises a presumption of ownership in their favor. Moreover, the plaintiffs’ suit is barred by limitation under Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963, as they failed to challenge the appellants’ possession within the prescribed period. (iv). Necessity of Declaratory Relief: The appellants contend that the plaintiffs should have filed a suit for declaration of title before seeking possession, especially when their ownership was in dispute. Without a declaratory decree establishing their title, the plaintiffs are not entitled to a decree for possession. (v). Conduct of the Plaintiffs: The appellants highlight that the First Appellate Court had termed the plaintiffs as “land grabbers” who manipulated revenue records to claim ownership. The High Court, however, did not address these observations or the detailed reasoning provided by the First Appellate Court. 1264 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 6. The arguments advanced on behalf of respondents by Shri Santosh Paul, learned Senior Advocate are summarized hereunder: (i). Admission of Plaintiffs’ Title by the Defendants: The respondents assert that the appellants did not specifically deny their ownership of the suit property in their written statement before the Trial Court. By taking the plea of adverse possession, the appellants implicitly admitted the respondents’ title. Under VIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, failure to deny an allegation of fact amounts to an admission. (ii). State Cannot Claim Adverse Possession: The respondents argue that the State cannot perfect title over private property through adverse possession against its own citizens. Allowing such a claim would be contrary to the principles of a welfare State and undermine citizens’ constitutional rights. (iii). Permissive Possession by the State: The respondents contend that the appellants’ possession of the suit land was permissive and not adverse. The Misal Hakiyat of 1879-80 (Exhibit DW10/1) indicates that the State’s possession was conditional, described as “Bikhar Bahali Kaza,” meaning till the existence of an orchard. Acts such as placing bitumen drums or constructing temporary structures do not amount to adverse possession. The Trial Court rightly held that such acts do not constitute possession sufficient to establish adverse possession. (iv). Establishment of Ownership through Revenue Records: The respondents have established their ownership through continuous entries in the revenue records (jamabandis) from 1904-05 to 2019-20. Plaintiff No. 1 derived title through a registered sale deed dated 5th July 1960, and Plaintiff No. 2 through a sale deed dated 12th March 1973. Mutations were duly sanctioned based on these sale deeds. Revenue records are records of rights and are admissible evidence to prove ownership.
