Admittedly, the employment was not done till 30.01.2018. There is a delay of roughly eight years, short of 36 days. Respondent no. 4-DSGMC had offered employment to the petitioners by its letter dated 17.08.2010 calling upon them to join Guru Tegh Bahadur International School, Fatehabad, Haryana. The petitioners declined to join the said school, because the said offer was not in accordance with the directions of this Court i.e. the school was neither Government owned nor Government-aided. Furthermore, it was situated in Haryana and not in Delhi. Keeping the said response in mind, the DSGMC offered yet another employment at their various schools in Delhi, however, yet again none of these schools were either Government owned or Government-aided. Hence, the petitioners expressed their reservations in joining the said schools. Their concern primarily was that their service conditions and employment benefits should not be affected, which indeed, had been secured by the of the Division Bench dated 09.12.2009 and 08.02.2010. 6 Contempt Petition (Civil) No. 805 of 2016 in Manju Tomar & Ors. v. Manjit Singh GK & Ors. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 657 New Delhi Municipal Council v. Manju Tomar and Other The petitioners replied to the DSGMC on the same date on which they received the offer i.e. 28.08.2010. Their reply reads as under: “The job offered to us is not as per the of the Delhi High Court dt. 9/12/09 & 8/2/10, in which Para 15, 17 & 20 clearly says that job should be on same terms & conditions on which they were employed when Primary school was owning in the NDMC area. So Please give us job in Govt/Govt-Aided School as per High Court judgement to avoid contempt of Supreme Court dt 9/8/10. We have also filed Affidavit in this connection. In The Supreme Court dt 27/8/10.” Subsequent to this reply, there was no communication to any of the petitioners by DSGMC. In the absence of such communication, the offer from the DSGMC did not exist. Hence, DSGMC is in breach of the s of the Division Bench and the s which had directed that all the five petitioners be re-employed within twelve weeks of the dated 09.12.2009. The said time got over on 08.03.2010. Due to the non-compliance the second limb of the becomes operative. Resultantly, the petitioners are entitled to full pay and all perquisites from 04.03.2010 onwards till 30.01.2018. Respondent no. 4-DSGMC shall, therefore, pay the petitioner nos. 1 to 5 their full pay and all perquisites in terms of the of the Division Bench dated 08.02.2010. The said monies shall be paid to them within four weeks from the date of receipt of this . The interest on the delay will be considered thereafter. The due amounts shall be credited directly into the bank accounts of the petitioners, who shall supply their respective bank account details, to Respondent no.4- DSGMC directly as well as through counsel. Respondent no. 4 shall furnish the computation of the amounts due to each of the petitioners within the next two weeks and shall pay the due amounts by 13.12.2019.” (emphasis added) 658 [2024] 8 S.C.R.
