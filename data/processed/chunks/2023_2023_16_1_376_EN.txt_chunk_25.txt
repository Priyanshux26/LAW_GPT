However, unlike CO 272, COs 48 and 72 did not contain any references to Article 370. They were purely clarifi catory s. They did not make any substantive changes to Article 370.61 However, CO 272 makes amendments to Article 370, through the backdoor62; g. The Respondents’ argument that the proviso to Article 370(3) and the requirement of a recommendation of the Constituent Assembly ceased to exist after the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly is incorrect. While the powers under Article 370(1)(b) are in the nature of amending powers, the power under Article 370(3) is a constituent power. Considering the limitations placed on both, to accept the Respondents’ argument would lead to an inconsistent conclusion that the amending provision would be more onerous than abolishing it under Article 370(3). Thus, Article 370(3) could only be abrogated by a Constituent body and no less63; h. Article 370 could have been amended only by resorting to Article 370(3), subject to the proviso thereto. This was reiterated by this Court in Prem Nath Kaul v. State of J&K64, which was decided after the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir had ceased to exist; i. In the alternative, Article 367 does not apply to Article 370(3) because the latter starts with a non-obstante clause.

IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 41 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] Article 367 cannot be used to make any changes to Article 370(3)65; j. The Constitution cannot be amended by an executive . Only Parliament in exercise of its constituent power can amend the Constitution of India. The CO, which effectively amends the Constitution, could not be affected by an executive 66; k. CO 272 made CO 1954 inapplicable. It was issued with the due concurrence of the Constituent Assembly of the state, which was in existence at the time. As such, the Governor had no jurisdiction to concur to make such a CO, issued with the concurrence of the Constituent Assembly non- applicable67; l. The wholesale application of the Constitution of India suff ers from a lack of application of mind – which was a mandatory pre-condition. Article 370(1)(d) contemplates a situation where, based on the exigencies of the situation, and upon due application of mind, certain specifi c provisions of the Constitution are extended to the State of Jammu and Kashmir in to address the said exigencies. CO 272 applies the provisions of the entire Constitution of India to the state. No deliberations took place to decide the suitability of those provisions for the state. Such wholesale application of the whole Constitution, in one go, is apparently without any deliberation68; m. The Respondents have erroneously relied on Mohd.
