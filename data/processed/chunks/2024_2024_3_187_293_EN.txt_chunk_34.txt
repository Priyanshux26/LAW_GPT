It has been held that ecocentrism i.e. nature centered where humans are a part of nature and non-humans have intrinsic value will have to be adopted. It has been held that human interest does not take automatic precedence and humans have obligations to non-humans independently of human interest. It has been held that the National Wildlife Action Plan 2002-2012 and the Centrally Sponsored Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats Scheme, 2009 are centred on the principle of ecocentrism. 2 [2012] 3 SCR 460 : (2012) 3 SCC 277 : 2012 INSC 81 242 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 70. This Court again in the case of Centre for Environmental Law, World Wide Fund-India v. Union of India and others3, following the earlier s, observed thus : “44. The scope of the Centrally-sponsored scheme was examined in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India [(2012) 3 SCC 277] (Wild Buffalo case) and this Court directed implementation of that scheme in the State of Chhattisgarh. The Centrally-sponsored scheme, as already indicated, specifically refers to the Asiatic lions as a critically endangered species and highlighted the necessity for a recovery programme to ensure the long-term conservation of lions. NWAP, 2002-2016 and the Centrally-sponsored scheme, 2009 relating to integrated development of wildlife habitats are schemes which have statutory status and as held in Lafarge case [Lafarge Umiam Mining (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (2011) 7 SCC 338] and have to be implemented in their letter and spirit. While giving effect to the various provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, the Centrally-sponsored scheme, 2009, the NWAP, 2002-2016 our approach should be ecocentric and not anthropocentric.” [emphasis supplied] 71. It could thus be seen that, this Court held that the National Wildlife Action Plan (NWAP), 2002-2016, and the Centrally-sponsored scheme, 2009 related to the integrated development of wildlife habitats are schemes that have a statutory status, and will have to be implemented in letter and spirit. 72. It can further be seen that, this Court has emphasized on the importance of sustainable development, i.e., balancing the rights of the citizens and the concern for the environmental and ecological issues. 73. In this respect, it will be appropriate to refer to Articles 48-A and 51-A(g) of the Constitution, which read thus : 3 [2013] 6 SCR 757 : (2013) 8 SCC 234 : 2013 INSC 254 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 243 In Re: T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India & Ors. In Re: Gaurav Kumar Bansal “48-A. Protection and improvement of environment and safeguarding of forests and wildlife.—The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. *** 51-A. Fundamental duties.—It shall be the duty of every citizen of India— *** (g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures;” 74. In Vellore Citizens’ Welfare Forum v. Union of India and others4, this Court observed thus : “10. The traditional concept that development and ecology are opposed to each other is no longer acceptable.
