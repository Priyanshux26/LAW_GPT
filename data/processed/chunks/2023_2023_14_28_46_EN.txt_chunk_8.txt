Effect of non-registration of documents required to be registered.— No document required by section 17 [or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882)], to be registered shall— (a) aff ect any immovable property comprised therein, or (b) confer any power to adopt, or (c) be received as evidence of any transaction aff ecting such property or conferring such power, unless it has been registered: [Provided that an unregistered document aff ecting immovable property and required by this Act or the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), to be registered may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specifi c performance under Chapter II of the Specifi c Relief Act, 1877 (3 of 1877), or as evidence of any collateral transaction not required to be eff ected by registered instrument. ]” 9. The aforesaid provisions were analysed by this Court in the case of Anthony -vs- K.C. Ittoop & Sons and Others [(2000) 6 SCC 394], and this authority was also cited before the High Court.This was a case in which the respondent was inducted into possession of a premises under a lease deed for a period of fi ve years, but the deed was not registered. It has been held in this :- 40 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. “11. The resultant position is insurmountable that so far as the instrument of lease is concerned there is no scope for holding that the appellant is a lessee by virtue of the said instrument. The Court is disabled from using the instrument as evidence and hence it goes out of consideration in this case, hook, line and sinker (vide Shantabai v. State of Bombay [AIR 1958 SC 532 : 1959 SCR 265] , Satish Chand Makhan v. Govardhan Das Byas [(1984) 1 SCC 369] and Bajaj Auto Ltd. v. Behari Lal Kohli [(1989) 4 SCC 39 : AIR 1989 SC 1806] . 12. But the above fi nding does not exhaust the scope of the issue whether the appellant is a lessee of the building. A lease of immovable property is defi ned in Section 105 of the TP Act. A transfer of a right to enjoy a property in consideration of a price paid or promised to be rendered periodically or on specifi ed occasions is the basic fabric for a valid lease. The provision says that such a transfer can be made expressly or by implication. Once there is such a transfer of right to enjoy the property a lease stands created. What is mentioned in the three paragraphs of the fi rst part of Section 107 of the TP Act are only the diff erent modes of how leases are created. The fi rst para has been extracted above and it deals with the mode of creating the particular kinds of leases mentioned therein. The third para can be read along with the above as it contains a condition to be complied with if the parties choose to create a lease as per a registered instrument mentioned therein.
