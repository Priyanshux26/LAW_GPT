We trust and hope that the widening of the road will be completed within a year.” (Emphasis supplied by us) 8. For complying the aforesaid direction an attempt was made to issue notification dated 05.04.2017 namely to carry out the widening of Jayamahal Road from Mekhri Circle up to Cantonment Railway Station and Bellary Road from BDA Junction to Mekhri Circle. After two (2) years i.e., on 17.07.2019, the State Government issued a Government permitting BBMP to issue TDR to the concerned land owners. Hence, a communication dated 29.08.2019 was addressed by the complainants to the Commissioner BBMP seeking to expedite the process of issuance of TDR and documents in support of their claim were also forwarded. However, TDR’s were not issued for no reason at all. Thus, from 21.11.2014 till 17.07.2019 there was absolute silence on the part of contemnors and there is not even a whisper in the affidavits filed by the respondents in this regard viz., as to the reason for non-implementation of the dated 21.11.2014. Knowing fully, the consequences of non-implementing the s of this Court, yet respondents consciously ignored to comply with the directions issued by this Court. After four (4) years notification came to be issued on 05.04.2017 to widen the road. Again, respondents went into deep slumber for two (2) years i.e., till 17.07.2019 date of government issued resolving to issue TDR in favour of landowners. Silence on the part of the contemnors from 05.04.2017 to 17.07.2019 has to be termed as deliberate with full knowledge of consequences flowing therefrom. Thus, delay of five (5) years in 1304 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports implementation of the dated 21.11.2014 till 17.07.2019 not only remains unexplained but also prima-facie seems to be intentional and not bonafide or there being any genuine inability and this is the first stage of intentional delay. This Court in Ram kishan Vs. Tarun Bajaj & Ors4 has opined that deliberate conduct of a person means that he knows what he is doing and intends to do the same. Therefore, there has to be a calculated action with evil motive on his part. Though Government dated 17.07.2019 came to be issued, that too after five (5) years after passing of s (direction) by this Court to issue TDR’s, yet it did not fructify. Thus, irresistible conclusion will have to be drawn that non-implementation of the s of this Court was deliberate and intentional act on the part of contemnors. 9. From the pleadings of these proceedings it would also emerge, yet another Writ Petition No. 6585 of 2020 (PIL) had also been filed for expediting the process for road widening and an came to be passed by the High Court of Karnataka on 07.01.2021 in that regard whereunder the State Government was directed to report the compliance by implementing with the directions contained in paragraph 10 of this Court’s dated 21.11.2014 and paragraph 12 of High Court dated 07.09.2016 passed in Writ Petition No. 42927 of 2015 and for reporting such compliance, the State Government was granted time till 15.02.2021.
