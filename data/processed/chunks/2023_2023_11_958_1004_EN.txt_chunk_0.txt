Whether the alleged acts of commission for which the Detenu has been kept under detention are prejudicial to ‘public ’ and whether all relevant circumstances were considered or whether extraneous factors weighed in the mind of the detaining authority leading to the conclusion that the Detenu is a habitual off ender and for prevention of further crimes by him, he ought to be detained. Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, Land Grabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, Fertiliser Off enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders, Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, Gaming Off enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, Arms Off enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or Financial Offenders Act 1986 – During the years 2022 and 2023, in quick succession, appellant’s husband had committed 9 (nine) more off ences and 5 (fi ve) FIRs were registered under various sections 186, 189, 353, 504, 420, 384, 354, 420, 323, 392, 195A of IPC – An of detention dated 24.03.2023 was passed – Propriety: Held: The of detention impugned failed to diff erentiate between off ences which create a “law and ” situation and which prejudicially aff ect or tend to prejudicially aff ect “public ” – Even if the off ences 958 AMEENA BEGUM v. THE STATE OF TELANGANA 959 & ORS. referred to in the Detention , alleged to have been committed by the Detenu have led to the satisfaction being formed, still the same are separate and stray acts aff ecting private individuals and the repetition of similar such acts would not tend to aff ect the even fl ow of public life – The off ence in respect of the minor girl did exercise consideration of the Court for some time but it was noted that the Detenu was not arrested because of an passed by the High Court on an application u/s. 438 of the Cr.PC. – Even otherwise, the gravity of the off ences alleged in Arun Ghosh case was higher in degree, yet, the same were not considered as aff ecting ‘public ’ – The only other off ence that could attract the enumerated category of “acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public ” and an of preventive detention, if at all, is the stray incident where the Detenu has been charged u/s. 353, IPC and where the police has not even contemplated an arrest u/s. 41 of the Cr.PC – On an overall consideration of the circumstances, the existing legal framework for maintaining law and is suffi cient to address like off ences under consideration, which the Commissioner anticipates could be repeated by the Detenu if not detained – The of detention is, thus, indefensible.
