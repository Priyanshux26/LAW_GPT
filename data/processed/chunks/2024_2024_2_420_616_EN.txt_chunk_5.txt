[Paras 131, 138, 139, 142] Doctrines/Principles — Principle of proportionality - Proportionality standard test — Four prongs — Explanation of: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CuI.) (for himself and for B R Gavai, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, JJ) Proportionality standard is laid down to determine if the violation of the fundamental right is justified — Proportionality standard is-the [2024] 2 S.C.R. 427 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. measure restricting a right must have a legitimate goal (legitimate goal stage); the measure must be a suitable means for furthering the goal (Suitability or rational connection stage); the measure must be least restrictive and equally effective (necessity stage); and the measure must not have a disproportionate impact on the right holder (balancing stage) — At the legitimate goal stage, the Court is to analyze if the objective of introducing the law is a legitimate purpose for the infringement of rights — Second prong of the proportionality analysis requires the State to assess whether the means used are rationally connected to the purpose - At this stage, the court is required to assess whether the means, if realised, would increase the likelihood of the purpose - It is not necessary that the means chosen should be the only means capable of realising the purpose — Next stage is the necessity stage, wherein the Court is to determine if the means adopted is the least restrictive means to give effect to the purpose — The Court is to see, whether there are other possible means which could have been adopted by the State; whether the alternative means identified realise the objective in a ‘real and substantial manner’; whether the alternative identified and the means used by the State impact fundamental rights differently; and whether on an overall comparison (and balancing) of the measure and the alternative, the alternative is better suited considering the degree of realizing the government objective and the impact on fundamental rights — In the last stage, the Court undertakes a balancing exercise to analyse if the cost of the interference with the right is proportional to the extent of fulfilment of the purpose — It is in this step that the Court undertakes an analysis of the comparative importance of the considerations involved in the case, the justifications for the infringement of the rights, and if the effect of infringement of one right is proportional to achieve the goal [Paras 105, 106, 117, 119, 156] — Held: (per Sanjiv Khanna, J.) Four steps of test of proportionality are: first step is to examine whether the act/measure restricting the fundamental right has a legitimate aim, second step is to examine whether the restriction has rational connection with the aim, third step is to examine whether there should have been a less restrictive alternate measure that is equally effective, and last stage is to strike an appropriate balance between the fundamental right and the pursued public purpose.
