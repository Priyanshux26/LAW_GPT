786 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. 22.4. Lastly, the detention had not been set aside by the Court of competent jurisdiction. Therefore, clause (iv) would have no application. 23. To the contrary, in the present case against the detention , the appellant had made a representation which had been rejected. Thereafter the said was challenged before the High Court by way of a writ petition which had also been dismissed on merits by a detailed upholding the detention . The revocation however had been made on a statement given on behalf of the Union of India before this Court in to institute a complaint under the relevant statute. The said revocation is not contemplated under Section 2(2)(b) and its proviso, and, therefore, no benefi t can be extended to the appellant(s) on the said count. Therefore, in our view, the impugned does not suff er from any infi rmity warranting interference. The appeals lack merit and are, accordingly dismissed. 24. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals dismissed. Divya Pandey
