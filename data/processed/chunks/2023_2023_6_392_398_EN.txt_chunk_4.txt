If circumstances had transpired which led to a variation in the number of trees to be cut, D the only correct course of action would have been to move this Court. We are, hence, of the view that it would be necessary for the Court to penalize MMRCL for its conduct. Having said that, the issue is as to whether the permission which has been granted on 15 March 2023 should be stayed by the Court, at the present stage. Any such direction will have the consequences of bringing the public project to a standstill. Such E a course of action would not be desirable. As the Court noted in its previous , substantial steps have already been taken by felling over 2000 trees for the purpose of the project. In this backdrop, we modify the previous by permitting MMRCL to act in compliance with the dated 15 March 2023. However, this shall be subject to the following F directions: (i) MMRCL shall, within a period of two weeks, deposit an amount of Rupees Ten Lakhs with the Conservator of Forests; (ii) The Conservator of Forests shall ensure that all directions G which have been contained in the previous s of the Tree Authority for afforestation have been duly complied with; (iii) The Conservator of Forests shall submit a report before this Court indicating the status of compliance in regard to H 398 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A the directions which have been issued up-to-date for afforestation and for transplantation of trees; and (iv) In to enable this Court to have objective assistance in regard to the compliance of the directions for afforestation, we request the Director of IIT Bombay to B depute a team for the purpose of verifying compliance. A report shall accordingly be submitted before this Court within a period of four weeks. The costs, charges and expenses payable shall be borne by MMRCL. 16. The IA is accordingly disposed of.
