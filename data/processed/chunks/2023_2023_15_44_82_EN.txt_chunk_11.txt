29. Strongly refuting the plea of the inability of the petitioner due to COVID-19 to obtain the Certifi cate within time, it is averred by the UPSC that the petitioner had availed the benefi t under EWS Category in the CSE 2021 by producing IA&C dated 09.10.2020 during the peak of the pandemic and that the plea of the petitioner, according to the UPSC, was highly improbable and did not deserve to be sustained. 60 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Response of the petitioner: 30. This affi davit has been countered by the petitioner by contending that, in her application,she had communicated her Category as EWS; that the petitioner was counted among the 1281 EWS candidates who qualifi ed for the Preliminary Examination and were admitted to the Main Examination; that the petitioner was never excluded at any stage due to her inability; that the UPSC itself admitted that the scrutiny of documents uploaded with DAF-I does not happen between the Preliminary Examination and the Main Examination; that the petitioner was part of the 298 EWS candidates who had qualifi ed the Main Examination; that the I&AC was scrutinized after the candidates were called for the interview and at the time of the interview the petitioner had shown the Certifi cate for the F.Y. 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 and before allocation of service, she had also submitted the Certifi cate for the F.Y. 2020-2021. In view of that, it is averred that the petitioner should not be excluded since the delayed submission had, in fact,not aff ected the Category wise selection process at any stage. Contentions: 31. We have considered the averments and the pleadings and heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at great length. 32. Ms. Preetika Dwivedi, learned counsel for the petitioner (Ms. Divya), reiterated her case set out in the pleadings and also sought to draw support from certain s of this Court. Shri K. Parameshwar, learned Counsel, argued for the petitioners in the other two writ petitions. Both the learned counsel, brought to bear, considerable diligence in their preparation and presentation of the case. 33. The primary contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that, once their categorization as an EWS was not in dispute, mere inability to have the Certifi cate as of 22.02.2022 should not operate to their prejudice. According to them, the delayed submission did not aff ect the Category wise allocation process at any stage and that there was no rationale for insisting on the Certifi cate to be dated before the cut-off i.e. 22.02.2022, namely, the last day for submission of the application for Preliminary Examination.
