v. MURALIDHAR 955 (D) & ORS. [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] other land except the leased land. Therefore he must give half his share of the land leased i.e. half of two acres viz. one acre only and retain the remaining one acre. Thus tenants B and C who have each 4 acres of their own will each have to give up 2 acres of the land leased and tenant D half of his two acres i.e. one acre. Thus, the landlord will be entitled to get back 5 acres out of the land leased while tenants B and C will have left 4 acres each and tenant D only one acre. Any other computation will bring about greater inequity. In the example given the tenancies of B and C would in the sequel be wholly terminated. If the total land leased as a whole and the total land in the possession of the joint tenants is taken into account without the notional division which we have suggested then the total land in the possession of the joint tenants would be 6 acres of leased land plus 8 acres of their own and if the landlord is held to be entitled to resume on the basis of the total land thus held he would resume the whole six acres leased by him but in that event the tenant D would be left entirely without any land. This would work greater hardship on the poorer tenant.” 27. From the evidence on record, we know that the landlord has 13 acres of jirayat land, which he holds as owner. The tenants in Survey No. 291 were Mr. Murlidhar Damodhar Modhe and Mr. Bhausaheb Damodar Modhe. The tenant in Survey No.290/1&290/2 was one, Mr. Kundalik Damodar Modhe. 28. Having regard to the aforesaid analysis of law, we are of the considered view that this litigation is pending for nearly 50 years and as such relegating the parties to the authorities would only add salt to the wound or acrimony between the parties would continue to haunt the future generations and as such we have undertaken the exercise of applying the formula prescribed under Section 33B(5)(b) as illustrated in Chunnilal Bhailal Wani case (supra) of the Act to allocate the respective shares of the parties on the basis of not only admission found from the depositions recorded at the earliest point of time but also on the revenue records which has been relied upon by the authorities for undertaking such exercise and as such we have arrived at the following entitlement of property by tabulating the same and the description of entitlement has also been narrated in the foot-note to the table. 956 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R.
