This matter pertains to the 31 vacancies that arose on the post of Laboratory Attendants, pursuant to an advertisement issued on 27.04.2011 by the PSEB. The eligibility criteria to apply for the said vacancies were that the candidate must have qualified 10th standard with Science & Punjabi as subjects. A total number of 4,752 applicants applied for these posts. As part of the initial screening, a preliminary written test was conducted on 28.09.2011, on the basis of which a total of 1,952 candidates were shortlisted as per the determined benchmark cut-off score. 3. These shortlisted candidates were subsequently called for the next segment of the selection process i.e., the interview stage. Due to the sheer number of candidates, interviews were conducted over multiple dates, culminating in the completion of the selection exercise. Thereafter, a final list of selected candidates was published on 04.04.2012. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 101 Sukhmander Singh and Ors Etc. v. The State of Punjab and Ors Etc. 4. Several unsuccessful candidates, aggrieved by their exclusion from the final list dated 04.04.2012, then moved the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh by filing different Writ Petitions, challenging the final list of selected candidates dated 04.04.2012 and seeking directions to conduct the same afresh. These aforementioned Writ Petitions were disposed of by a common dated 31.10.2012. The learned Single Judge, inter alia, concluded that the process of selection did not inspire confidence and accordingly, set aside the entire selection process and directed for these posts to be re-advertised by the PSEB.
