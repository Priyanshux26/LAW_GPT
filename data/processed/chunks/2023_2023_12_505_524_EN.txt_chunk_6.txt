Mr. Gupta submitted that these factors, which no doubt weighed on the sentencing court (which did not grant the death penalty), must also weigh on the state authority granting remission, to guide its exercise of discretion. 16.Counsel for the State, relied on the following s to persuade this court – Ramdas Athawale v. Union of India12, Union of India v. V. Sriharan13, State of Haryana v. Mahender Singh (supra), Swamy Shraddananda (2) @ Mural Manohar Mishra v. State of Karnataka14, State of Madhya Pradesh v. Ratan Singh15 and Rajan v. The Home Secretary, Home Department of Tamil Nadu16. Analysis and conclusion A. Applicable statutory provisions, rules, etc. 17. The Travancore-Cochin Prison Act came into force on 06.06.1950. By virtue of Sections 3(5) and 59(4), the state government enacted the 1958 Rules on 26.07.1958. The Kerala Prisons and Correctional Services (Management) Act, 2010 [hereafter ‘2010 Act’] came into force on 12/14.05.2010. By virtue of Section 102(2) of this Act (the savings clause) the 1958 Rules were to continue till the commencement of the new rules (i.e., the 2014 Rules), on 06/23.05.2014. On 14.06.2022, a government was issued containing general guidelines on premature release, classifying prisoners such that those who had committed certain off ences could not be released prematurely, while others, could only be considered after 25 years. This government also, incorporated an executive instruction dated 20.04.2022 which excluded those involved in “murder of a woman” 12 [2010] 3 SCR 1059 13 [2015] 14 SCR 613 14 [2008] 11 SCR 93 15 [1976] Supp. 1 SCR 552 16 [2019] 6 SCR 1035 JOSEPH v. THE STATE OF KERALA 515 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] among other crimes, from the grant of premature release. Section 433-A of the CrPC, is also applicable to the extent that it forecloses the option of statutory remission until the convict who has been convicted for an off ence punishable by life imprisonment (or commuted death sentence) has served 14 years of actual imprisonment. 18. Section 7717 of the 2010 Act empowers the state government to, either suo moto or on recommendation of an Advisory Committee, prematurely release well-behaved, long term convicted prisoners with the objective of their better reformation and rehabilitation, as per prescribed rules. Rule 462 to 468 of the 2014 Rules, detail the procedure to be followed by the Advisory Committee while considering convicts for premature release. Whenever a prisoner completes 14 years actual imprisonment, they become eligible for consideration for premature release [ref: Rule 464(iv)18]. The Advisory Committee/Board considers their case in detail, and make recommendations to the state government, which is empowered under Rule 468 of the 2014 Rules, to admit or reject the said recommendations. 19. A reading of the observations of this court in State of Haryana v. Jagdish19, which was followed in State of Haryana v. Raj Kumar20, makes the position of law clear: the remission policy prevailing on the date of conviction, is to be applied in a given case, and if a more liberal policy exists on the day of consideration, then the latter would apply.
