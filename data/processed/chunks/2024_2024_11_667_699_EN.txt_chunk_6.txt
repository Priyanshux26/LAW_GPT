5,40,000 (cheque dated 2.4.1997 which was dishonoured) 26.3.1997 Rs. 11,30,000 (Rs. 5,30,00 by cash and Rs. 6,00,00 by cheque) 26.3.1997 Rs. 13,00,000 by cheque 9.4.1997 Rs. 5,00,000 by cheque d. Clause 3 of the sale agreements states that the petitioner is required to pay the balance consideration and the respondents must furnish certificates within three months. The clause prescribes a consequence for non-payment, that the agreement would be cancelled. However, the clause does not prescribe any consequence if the respondents fail to furnish the necessary certificates within three months. It cannot be concluded that time is of the essence only because the agreement requires the petitioner to pay the balance consideration within three months. The respondents had not obtained the permissions and certifications required under Clause 3 and they did not inform the petitioner about any steps taken to obtain them. The cross-examination of DW-1 (first respondent) indicates this. Thus, time is not of essence in the agreement; e. The petitioner claims that he issued the first legal notice on 8 February 2000. However, the postal cover and postal certificate indicate that it was registered on 31 March 2000. Thus, the petitioner ante-dated the legal notice to overcome limitation; f. The petitioner is not entitled to the discretionary relief of specific performance if a false plea is made. In this case, the petitioner made three false pleas; g. The petitioner has been unable to prove that he was willing to perform his part of the contract within three years from the sale agreements and specifically, within three months according to the agreement. If the petitioner was able to perform his part, a notice would have been issued earlier or the balance would have been deposited in the bank; [2024] 11 S.C.R. 677 M/s Siddamsetty Infra Projects Pvt. Ltd. v. Katta Sujatha Reddy & Ors. h. The first part of Article 54 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act 1963 applies to the facts of the case. The petitioner was required to pay the balance consideration within three months from the date of the sale agreement. The suit should have been filed on or before 26 June 2000 (three years from the date fixed for the performance). However, the suit was filed on 9 August 2002, nearly two years after the limitation expired. Thus, the suit was time barred; and i. The suit was barred by time for recovery of the advance amount in terms of Article 47 of Schedule to the Limitation Act. 10. The petitioner preferred an appeal before the High Court against the of the Additional District Judge. By a dated 23 April 2021, the High Court partly allowed the appeal for the following reasons: a. The Trial Court did not distinguish between the time fixed for payment of sale consideration and the time for the performance of the contract. The first part of Clause 3 of the agreements only fixes the time for the payment of sale consideration. The performance of the contract hinges on the respondents furnishing the documents.
