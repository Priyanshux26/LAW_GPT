It was also alleged that the original registration certificate of the said vehicle was lying at the Kolkata Branch, and that neither Mr. Adridharan Das nor Mr. Madhu Pandit Das or any other person had any E authority to get the said vehicle transferred to Bengaluru or to change the name of the registered owner of the said vehicle. 5. It is further case of the respondent-complainant that since the Ballygunge Police Station had not taken notice of the said letter dated 30.09.2006, the complainant Radha Raman Das, the Branch Manager F of ISKCON, Kolkata had filed a private complaint in the year 2009 in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Alipore, against the accused Madhu Pandit Das, Chanchalpati Das, Mahajan Das and Adridharan Das seeking investigation under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. The said case was registered as criminal case no. 747 of 2009 in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, G Alipore. 6. It appears that the said Court Petition under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C was registered as FIR being no. 33 at the Ballygunge Police Station on 20.02.2009 for the offences under Section 379/ 411/ 406/ 408/ 120-B/ 468/ 471 IPC. The investigating officer on the completion of investigation submitted the charge-sheet being no. 58 in the court of H CHANCHALPATI DAS v. THE STATE OF WEST BENGAL & 661 ANR. [BELA M. TRIVEDI, J.] Chief Judicial Magistrate, Alipore against the accused Madhu Pandit A Das, Chanchalpati Das, Mahajan Das and Adridharan Das, for the offences under Section 468, 471, 406 and 120-B IPC on 23.10.2010. 7. The appellant-accused Chanchalpati Das filed a petition being CRR No. 1490 of 2013 and the appellant-accused Madhu Pandit Das filed a petition being CRR No. 3307/2013 before the High Court of B Kolkata seeking quashing of proceedings of criminal case no. 747 of 2009 pending before the CJM, Alipore. The High Court vide the common impugned judgement and dismissed both the Criminal Revisions. 8. The learned Senior Advocate Mr. Shyam Divan for the appellants vehemently submitted that the prosecution initiated against C the appellants by the respondent-complainant was only an attempt to harass the appellants under the guise of the bus theft case to settle the personal scores with appellants, as the appellants were able to create around 30 ISKCON/Hare Krishna Movement associated Centres under the aegis of ISKCON Bengaluru, who follow the teachings of Srila D Prabhupada, by keeping him as the sole Diksha Acharya. He further submitted that the allegations in the complaint/FIR are not only absurd and improbable, but there is no reasonable possibility of the appellants being convicted for the alleged offences after the trial. Relying upon the documents with regard to the transfer of registration of the bus in question, he submitted that the said bus was registered at Kolkata on 20.11.1998, E however thereafter was registered at Bengaluru on 22.05.2002 after the execution of necessary documents of transfer and at present the bus is lying in the dump yard at Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh. According to him, filing of an FIR in 2009 for the alleged theft of bus taken place in 2002, was sheer abuse of process of law.
