As regards adjustment of the appellants (i.e., petitioners in SLP (C) No. 4321 of 2022) against vacancies that might have arisen subsequent to appointment against the advertised vacancies is concerned, in our view, it would not be appropriate as those vacancies would have to be fi lled after a fresh advertisement and in accordance with the extant Rules. 45. In light of the aforesaid discussion and conclusion, we direct / as under: (i) The relaxation / clarifi catory dated 21.08.2017, as approved by the State cabinet on 18.09.2017, being after the last date fi xed by the advertisements dated 13.02.2015 (i.e., for Post Code 447) and dated 18.10.2016 (for Post Code 556) for receipt of applications from candidates, is not legally sustainable qua those posts (i.e., Post Codes 447 and 556), particularly, when no opportunity was aff orded to similarly placed persons, who might have been left out, to apply and compete with those candidates who, though not eligible as per the terms of the advertisement, had applied thereunder; (ii) The direction(s) contained in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the impugned of the High Court setting aside the closure of the selection process for Post Code 556 and to re-cast the merit list as well as fi ll up remaining posts of Post Code 556, with the aid of relaxation/ clarifi cation dated 21.08.2017/ 18.09.2017 read with communication dated 19.03.2018, after segregating it from those advertised as Post Code 817, are set aside. In consequence, (a) the merit list prepared under the second advertisement for Post Code 556 shall not be re- drawn by including such candidates who, though not eligible, became eligible pursuant to relaxation / clarifi catory dated 21.08.2017 / 18.09.2017 read with communication dated 19.03.2018; and (b) there shall be no segregation of seats advertised under the third advertisement dated 21.09.2020 for Post Code 817. Thus, recruitment for Post Code 858 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 817 shall be strictly in accordance with the extant Rules (i.e., 2020 Rules), as notifi ed. (iii) The appointments already made under the fi rst advertisement (for Post Code 447) shall not be disturbed merely because some of the appointees may have gained eligibility based on the of relaxation / clarifi cation dated 21.08.2017, which was approved by the State cabinet. 46.
