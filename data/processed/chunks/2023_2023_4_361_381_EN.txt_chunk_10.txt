It is submitted that the Court vacations are notified well in advance and would not account to a fortuitous circumstance as alleged. G It is submitted that on the date of receipt of award, the party would be well aware of the limitation period under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act and ought to diligently secure its right. It is submitted that in the present case, having received the award on 24.08.2016, the appellant had a further period of 25 days after expiry of “prescribed period” and before commencement of the winter vacation of the trial Court. However, H 374 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A the petitioner - appellant chose not to file its petition during this time and therefore, as to suffer for the inevitable consequences. 5.10 It is further submitted that right under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is a restricted right to challenge an award on extremely limited ground. The proviso to Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act further B excludes the general power of the Court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act and imposes a strict timeline for presentation of a petition under Section 34. In such circumstances, acceptance of appellant’s argument will have the effect of providing an unduly enlarged time period (beyond the statutory 30 day discretionary period) for delayed presentation of a petition under Section 34, which would be contrary to the scheme and C intent of the Arbitration Act. 5.11 Now, so far as the applicability of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 as per the case of the appellant is concerned, it is vehemently submitted that as such the contention is untenable in light of the proviso to Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which D specifically excludes the application of this section to any Act or proceeding to which the Indian Limitation Act applies. It is submitted that reference to 1877 Act will now have to be read as reference to Limitation Act, 1963 in view of section 8 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. It is submitted that it is no longer res integra that the Limitation E Act, 1963 applies to arbitrations and court proceedings arising out of the arbitrations in light of Section 41(3) of the Arbitration Act. Reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of State of Maharashtra v. Borse Brothers Engineers and Contractors Pvt. Ltd. reported in (2021) 6 SCC 460 and Consolidated Engineering Enterprises vs. Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department and F Ors. reported in (2008) 7 SCC 169. It is submitted that therefore in light of the application of the Limitation Act, 1963 applicable to the proceedings under the Arbitration Act (both in Court and in arbitration), Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is specifically excluded, and therefore, cannot be relied upon by the appellant. G 5.12 It is submitted that even otherwise this Court in the Sagufa Ahmed (Supra) has held that the principle forming the basis of Section 10(1) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 also finds a place in Section 4 of the Limitation Act.
