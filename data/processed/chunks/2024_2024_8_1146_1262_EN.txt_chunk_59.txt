Regarding the argument of the accused having to face the trial despite being in a position to produce material of unimpeachable character of sterling quality, the width of the powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code and Article 226 of the Constitution is unlimited whereunder in the interests of justice the High Court can make such s as may be necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice within the parameters laid down in Bhajan Lal case91 [1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 426].” [emphasis added] 18.4 In Rukmini Narvekar v. Vijaya Satardekar and Others,92 this Court has observed that the width of the powers of the High Court under Section 482, Cr.P.C and under Article 226 of the Constitution of India are unlimited, that the High Court could make such s as may be necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In a concurring passed in the very same case, it was observed in addition that in exercising jurisdiction under Section 482, Cr.P.C, the High Court is free to consider even material that may be produced on behalf of the accused to arrive at a decision whether charge as framed could be maintained. 18.5 In Anand Kumar Mohatta and Another v. State (NCT of Delhi), Department of Home and Another,93 referring to the provisions of Section 482, Cr.P.C, this Court held as follows: 16. There is nothing in the words of this section which restricts the exercise of the power of the Court to prevent the abuse of process of court or miscarriage of justice only to the stage of the FIR. It is settled principle of law that the High Court can exercise jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC even when the discharge application 91 (1992) Supp (1) SCC 335 92 [2008] 14 SCR 271 : (2008) 14 SCC 1 93 [2018] 13 SCR 1028 : (2019) 11 SCC 706 1244 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports is pending with the trial court [G. Sagar Suri v. State of U.P., (2000) 2 SCC 636, para 7 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 513. Umesh Kumar v. State of A.P., (2013) 10 SCC 591, para 20 : (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 338 : (2014) 2 SCC (L&S) 237] . Indeed, it would be a travesty to hold that proceedings initiated against a person can be interfered with at the stage of FIR but not if it has advanced and the allegations have materialised into a charge-sheet. On the contrary it could be said that the abuse of process caused by FIR stands aggravated if the FIR has taken the form of a charge- sheet after investigation. The power is undoubtedly conferred to prevent abuse of process of power of any court. xxxxx 28. In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal [State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 426], this Court has set out the categories of cases in which the inherent power under Section 482 CrPC can be exercised.
