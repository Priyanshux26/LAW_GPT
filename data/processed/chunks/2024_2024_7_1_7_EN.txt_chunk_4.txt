We may note that the decision in the case of State of Himachal Pradesh and Another v. Himachal Techno Engineers and Another 1 which is relied upon by the appellant, follows the aforesaid decision. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 7 The State of West Bengal represented through the Secretary & Ors. v. Rajpath Contractors and Engineers Ltd. 10. In the facts of the case in hand, the three months provided by way of limitation expired a day before the commencement of the pooja vacation, which commenced on 1st October 2022. Thus, the prescribed period within the meaning of Section 4 of the Limitation Act ended on 30th September 2022. Therefore, the appellants were not entitled to take benefit of Section 4 of the Limitation Act. As per the proviso to sub-section (3) of Section 34, the period of limitation could have been extended by a maximum period of 30 days. The maximum period of 30 days expired on 30th October 2022. As noted earlier, the petition was filed on 31st October 2022. 11. Thus, looking from the angle, the High Court was right in holding that the petition filed by the appellants under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was not filed within the period specified under sub- section (3) of Section 34. Hence, we find no merit in the appeal, and it is, accordingly, dismissed. Result of the case: Appeal Dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
