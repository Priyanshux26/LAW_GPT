It further appears that the Borrower also deposited 10% upfront amount i.e. Rs.37,50,000/.

No. 1691 of 2020 in the proceedings pending before DRT requesting for advancing the date of hearing stating that there was urgency in the matter and also that the appellant-auction purchaser had withdrawn from the auction. Thereafter, vide dated 21st September 2020, the said S.A. No. 1476 of 2017 came to be withdrawn on a statement made by the counsel for the Borrower that the matter had been settled out of court.
