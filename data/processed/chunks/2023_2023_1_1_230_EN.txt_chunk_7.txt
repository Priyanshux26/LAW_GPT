)]: While examining as to whether the impugned provisions of the statute and rules amount to reasonable restrictions and are brought out in the interest of the general public, the exercise that is required to be undertaken is balancing of the E fundamental right to carry on occupation on the one hand and the restrictions imposed on the other hand – Four tests of proportionality which need to be satisfied – The first one is that it should be designated for a proper purpose – The second one is that the measures undertaken to effectuate such a limitation are rationally connected to the fulfilment of that purpose – The third one is that F the measures undertaken are necessary in that there are no alternative measures that may similarly achieve that same purpose with a lesser degree of limitation – Finally, the fourth one is that there needs to be a proper relation between the importance of achieving the proper purpose and the social importance of G preventing the limitation on the constitutional right – There has to be a balance between a constitutional right and public interest – A constitutional licence to limit those rights is granted where such a limitation will be justified to protect public interest or the rights of others – By demonetization, the right vested in the notes was not taken away – The only restrictions were with regard to exchange of H VIVEK NARAYAN SHARMA v.

Demonetisation – Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 – s.26 – D Held [per B.V. Nagarathna, J. ]: The Act does not envisage initiation of demonetisation of bank notes by the Central Government – Sub- section (2) of s.26 of the Act, contemplates demonetisation of bank notes at the instance of the Central Board of the Reserve Bank of India – Hence, if demonetisation is to be initiated by the Central Government, such power is derived from Entry 36 of List I of the E Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which speaks of currency, coinage and legal tender; foreign exchange – Constitution of India – Entry 36 of List I of the Seventh Schedule.
