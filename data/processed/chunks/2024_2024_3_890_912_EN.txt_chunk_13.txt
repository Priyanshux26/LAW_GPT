The Superintendent gave permission on the body of the letter itself for unloading the cargo outside the warehouse but within the factory premises. The machinery parts which were thus unloaded were shifted to a shed outside the bonded warehouse but within the factory premises of the appellant so that those machinery parts did not get damaged, lying in the open and getting exposed to the elements. 49.1. Officials of the Preventive Branch of the Commissionerate searched the industrial premises of the appellant, including the notified public bonded warehouse, on 07.08.1992 and physically verified the stock in the notified public bonded warehouse as well as outside but within the industrial/factory premises of the appellant. On such verification, it was found that only 304 cases were stocked inside the warehouse, whereas 264 cases were found outside the warehouse but within the industrial/factory premises of the appellant. Remaining 27 cases were neither found inside the warehouse nor outside the warehouse but within the industrial/factory premises of the appellant. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 909 M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise 49.2. After issuance of show cause notice and hearing, respondent passed adjudication dated 28.08.1996 which suffered several rounds of appeals and remand. Ultimately, the Commissioner passed the final adjudication dated 28.04.2005 whereby demand of Rs.3,99,255.00 leviable on the 27 cases found not warehoused was confirmed. Appellant was also directed to pay interest on the said duty in terms of Section 28AB of the Customs Act. The 264 cases of imported goods found outside the notified warehouse were confiscated but option of redemption was given to the appellant on payment of fine of Rs.2,00,000.00. For the goods covered by the 264 cases, customs duty amounting to Rs.39,03,821.00 was directed to be recovered from the appellant in terms of Section 71 read with the proviso to Section 28A of the Customs Act. That apart, appellant was directed to pay interest of Rs.18,88,425.00 on the aforesaid quantum of customs duty in respect of the 264 cases from the date of warehousing till the date of detection of the shortage in the warehouse. Further, appellant was directed to pay interest under Section 28AB in respect of the 264 cases from the date of enforcement of the said section to till the date of actual payment of the duty. Penalty of Rs.1,00,000.00 was also imposed on the appellant under Section 112 of the Customs Act. 49.3. In appeal, CESTAT by the impugned affirmed the aforesaid decision of the Commissioner. 50. We may mention that the permission granted by the Superintendent to the appellant on 30.08.1989 to unload a portion of the cargo outside the open space which was notified as public bonded warehouse but within the factory premises of the appellant was neither cancelled nor revoked by the Superintendent or even by the Commissioner. Infact, a view can reasonably be taken that the appellant as the owner of the goods had exercised its right under Section 64(d) which was endorsed by the Superintendent. Therefore, it would not be correct to say that the 264 cases found outside the notified warehouse but within the factory premises of the appellant were improperly or unauthorisedly removed from the notified public bonded warehouse.
