(xiii) It is trite law that if the initial action is not in consonance with law, all subsequent and consequential proceedings would fall. In the present case, once offences under the PC Act are effaced from existence, the custody of the appellant pursuant to the s passed by the Special Court from time to time was without any sanction of law, as the Special Court in that case had no powers to remand persons accused of offences 588 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports under the IPC alone. The jurisdictional fact for the exercise of jurisdiction by the Special Court is the existence of an offence under the PC Act, and once such jurisdictional fact ceases to exist, the s of Special Court are required to be treated as without any sanction of law and non-est. In this regard, reliance is placed on State of Punjab vs. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar & Others4. (xiv) A legal bar to a prosecution is a valid ground for quashing the proceedings as held by this Court in R.P. Kapur vs. State of Punjab5 and State of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal6. 9. Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Mukul Rohtagi for the Respondent – State of Andhra Pradesh made following submissions: - (i) None of the facets contained in Section 17A would be applicable to the facts of the present case in as much as Section 17A of the PC Act came into force with effect from 26.07.2018, whereas the Regular Enquiry was initiated in respect of the alleged scam against the appellant and others by ACB vide the letter dated 05.06.2018, on the basis of the complaint received from within the DGSTI on 14.05.2018. When the Enquiry began, Section 17A was not in existence and therefore cannot be made applicable to the present case. (ii) On 11.07.2021, the State issued a memo at the request of the M.D. of APSSDC entrusting a detailed investigation into the very alleged scam. As long as the enquiry into the offence. i.e. facts constituting the offence by the ACB and the CID enquiry are one and the same i.e. about the siphoning of funds from APSSDC during the period 2015-2018. Therefore, the date of initiation of Enquiry into the said offence for the purpose of deciding the applicability of Section 17A of the PC Act is the date on which the Enquiry was first initiated into that particular offence, i.e. 05.06.2018 in the instant case. 4 (2011) 14 SCC 770 5 AIR 1960 SC 866 6 1992 (Suppl.) SCC 335 [2024] 1 S.C.R. 589 Nara Chandrababu Naidu v. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr. (iii) The word “Enquiry” is neither defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure nor in the PC Act. As per the Standard Operating Procedure issued by the Government of India however describes “enquiry” as – “enquiry for the purposes of the SOPs means any action taken, for verifying as to whether the information pertains to commission of an offence under the Act.” Hence, the date of initiation of Enquiry is only offence specific and not investigation agency specific or complaint/ complainant specific, and does not change by the mere change of investigating agency.
