Similar to this, the preamble of Foreigners Act, 1946 reads: "Whereas it is expedient to provide for the exercise by the Central Government of certain powers in respect of the entry of foreigners into India, their presence therein and their departure therefrom.” 1142 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 375. In light of this objective, Section 3(1) of the Foreigners Act, 1946 empowers the Central Government to make provisions concerning foreigners’ entry, departure, presence, or continued presence in India. Without diminishing the expansive authority granted by Section 3(1), Section 3(2) confers upon the Central Government the power to issue comprehensive s regarding foreigners, which include directives such as prohibiting a foreigner from remaining in India or any specified area, requiring the individual to meet the cost of removal from India, or compliance with specified conditions, etc. 376. We find from a perusal of both, the IEAA and the Foreigners Act, 1946, that these legislations seek to regulate the residence and departure of foreigners in India. To that extent, there is thus no conflict between the Statutes and both of them supplement and complement each other within the framework of Section 6A. This is also seconded by Sarbananda Sonawal (supra), which held: "83. To sum up our conclusions, the provisions of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, 1983 are ultra vires the Constitution and are accordingly struck down. The Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Rules, 1984 are also ultra vires and are struck down. As a result, the Tribunals and the Appellate Tribunals constituted under the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, 1983 shall cease to function. The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, the Foreigners Act, 1946, the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950 and the Passport Act, 1967 shall apply to the State of Assam […]” [Emphasis supplied] 377. That apart, and as held by the Court in Sarbanda Sonawal (supra), apart from the IEAA, there are various other statutes—including the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, the Foreigners Act, 1946, the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950 and the Passport Act, 1967—which are applicable to the State of Assam. 378. In light of the brief foregoing analysis of various statutes, we are of the considered opinion that Section 6A need not be construed in a restrictive manner to mean that a person shall be detected and deported only under the Foreigners Act, 1946. If there is any other piece of legislation such as the IEAA, under which the status of an immigrant can be determined, we see no reason as to why such [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1143 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 statutory detection shall also not be given effect to, for the purposes of deportation. We thus hold that the provisions of IEAA shall also be read into Section 6A and be applied along with the Foreigners Act, 1946 for the purpose of detection and deportation of foreigners. 379. Similarly, in light of this, we find it difficult to accept the second contention of the Petitioners that the IEAA is a complete code in dealing with the situation of immigrants in Assam, and that Section 6A cannot prescribe contrary norms by granting immigrants citizenship.
