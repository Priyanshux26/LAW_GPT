(3) The payment of balance of the price/ premium, rate of interest chargeable and the 936 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports recovery of interest shall be in the same manner as provided in sub-regulations (6) and (7) of Regulation 5. (4) The general terms and conditions of the auction shall be such as may be framed by the Chief Administrator from time to time and announced to the public before auction on the spot.” 14. We are fortified in our view by a decision of this Court in U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad v. Om Prakash Sharma [U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad v. Om Prakash Sharma (2013) 5 SCC 182 : (2013) 2 SCC (Civ) 737], wherein the questions arose for its consideration that : whether there is any vested right upon the plaintiff bidder until the bid is accepted by the competent authority in relation to the property in question? Merely because the plaintiff is the highest bidder by depositing 20% of the bid amount without there being approval of the same by the competent authority and it amounts to a concluded contract in relation to the plot in question; and whether the plaintiff could have maintained the suit in the absence of a concluded contract? Considering the aforesaid questions, this Court has discussed the matter thus : (SCC pp. 195-97, paras 30-31) “30. In support of the said proposition, the learned Senior Counsel for the defendant, Mr Rakesh Dwivedi has also placed reliance upon another decision of this Court in State of U.P. v. Vijay Bahadur Singh [State of U.P. v. Vijay Bahadur Singh (1982) 2 SCC 365]. The learned Senior Counsel has rightly placed reliance upon the of this Court in Rajasthan Housing Board case [Rajasthan Housing Board v. G.S. Investments (2007) 1 SCC 477] which reads as under : (SCC p. 483, para 9) ‘9. This being the settled legal position, the respondent acquired no right to claim that the auction be concluded in its favour and the [2024] 11 S.C.R. 937 Indore Vikas Praadhikaran (IDA) & Anr. v. Shri Humud Jain Samaj Trust & Anr. High Court clearly erred in entertaining the writ petition and in not only issuing a direction for consideration of the representation but also issuing a further direction to the appellant to issue a demand note of the balance amount. The direction relating to issuance of the demand note for balance amount virtually amounted to confirmation of the auction in favour of the respondent which was not the function of the High Court.’ In State of Orissa v. Harinarayan Jaiswal [State of Orissa v. Harinarayan Jaiswal (1972) 2 SCC 36] case, relevant paragraph of which reads as under : (SCC pp. 44-45, para 13) ‘13. … There is no concluded contract till the bid is accepted. Before there was a concluded contract, it was open to the bidders to withdraw their bids (see Union of India v. Bhim Sen Walaiti Ram [Union of India v. Bhim Sen Walaiti Ram (1969) 3 SCC 146] ).
