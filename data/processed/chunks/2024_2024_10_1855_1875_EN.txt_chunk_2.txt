Similarly, Zahoor Ahmed also filed an appeal under Section 11(1) of the 1953 Act against the said dated 06.12.1972 rejecting his claim qua Khata No. 100. By dated 25.04.1973, the appellate authority i.e. the Assistant Settlement Officer, Sultanpur dismissed all the appeals. In other words, of the Consolidation Officer dated 06.12.1972 was upheld. 6. Thereafter, respondents Sami Ullah and others filed a revision application before the Deputy Director of Consolidation, Gorakhpur (‘Deputy Director’, hereinafter). Likewise, the legal heirs of Zahoor Ahmed, Nisar Ahmed and others (‘appellants’ herein) also filed revision before the Deputy Director against rejection of their appeal. By the dated 20.09.1974, the Deputy Director opined that Zahoor Ahmed was not entitled to get share in the above Khatas and accordingly the of the Consolidation Officer as affirmed by the Assistant Settlement Officer i.e. the appellate authority was modified. Deputy Director while dismissing the revision of Zahoor Ahmed, Nisar Ahmed and others allowed the revision of the respondent Sami Ullah and others. 7. Appellants thereafter preferred Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 6635 of 1974 before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (briefly ‘the High Court’ hereinafter). By the and dated 05.01.2009, the High Court held that Deputy Director was not justified in importing principles of Hindu law while determining the share of the parties who were admittedly Mohammedans. Accordingly, the High Court held that the appellants have 1/12 share jointly in the plots comprised in Khata Nos. 98 and 99 excluding plot Nos. 35, 37, 111 and 112 which exclusively belongs to the respondents Sami Ullah and his brother Badlu, sons of Abdul Ghafoor. Accordingly, Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 6635 of 1974 was dismissed and Writ Petition No. 18 of 1975 was allowed. 8. It is this and dated 05.01.2009 which came to be assailed in the related special leave petitions and upon leave being [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1859 Nisar Ahmad & Ors. v. Sami Ullah (Dead) Through Lrs. & Anr. granted, the present civil appeals came to be registered. 9. While learned counsel for the appellants has contended that the High Court was not justified in upholding the passed by the Deputy Director in revision thereby adversely affecting the rights of the parties, learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand supports the impugned . He submits that the of the High Court is a well- reasoned and balanced and therefore should not be disturbed. 10. Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties have received the due consideration of the Court. 11. Zahoor Ahmed, the predecessor in interest of the appellants, had approached the Consolidation Officer under Section 9(2) of the 1953 Act raising a dispute regarding Khata Nos. 99 and 100. It may be mentioned that the Khata No. 99 was recorded in the name of Sami Ullah and Badlu (the respondents) whereas Khata No. 100 was recorded in the name of Sami Ullah alone. Zahoor Ahmed claimed co-tenancy in both the Khatas to the extent of 1/2 share. He also claimed half share in Khata No.
