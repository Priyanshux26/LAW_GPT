NTA has stated that both sets of papers were prepared by moderators to ensure that the difficulty level was the same. 39. The reports filed by the CBI indicate that the investigation is ongoing. At this stage, the CBI has indicated that the material gathered during the investigation suggests that about 155 students from the examination centres in Hazaribagh and Patna appear to be beneficiaries of the fraud (around 30 in Patna and around 125 in Hazaribagh). No material has been placed before us to demonstrate that the question paper or the solved answers were circulated at random or en masse over social media. 40. Separately, it appears that a plan to use unfair means in Godhra was uncovered before it could be executed. The affidavit filed by NTA states that a Deputy Superintendent of Examination had conspired with some students to fill in the answers in the OMR sheet after the conclusion of the test. The affidavit further states that the police became aware of this plan and that they arrested the accused persons before the test began. The candidates suspected to be involved in 70 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports this conspiracy were identified. NTA submits that their results were withheld and that show cause notices were issued to them. 41. This situation highlights several administrative and procedural flaws within NTA’s management of the exam. Firstly, the fact that question papers from Canara Bank were distributed to students in twelve centres instead of papers from SBI reveals a lapse in coordination and oversight. The fact that four centres managed to rectify the mistake while eight continued with the incorrect papers suggests a lack of effective communication between NTA, the centre-coordinators and the banks involved in the distribution process. 42. Secondly, the use of e-rickshaws for transporting question papers to examination centres raises concerns about the security and reliability of paper-handling procedures. E-rickshaws are relatively unsecured and lack proper monitoring, making them unsuitable for the secure transit of sensitive examination materials. This method might be vulnerable to theft, tampering, and mishandling, posing a serious risk to the integrity of the examination process. Although no lapses on this count have emerged this year, the possibility of such lapses is enough to warrant a change in the mode of transportation. 43. Thirdly, the use of private courier services for transporting examination materials introduces variability in handling standards and may not ensure the same level of security as official channels. Proper protocols and accountability measures need to be in place to ensure that such services maintain the highest standards of security and reliability. 44. Fourthly, CCTV surveillance is essential for monitoring activities and ensuring that all procedures are followed correctly. Any deficiency makes it challenging to prevent, detect, and address any irregularities or breaches that may occur during the examination process. ii. The marks awarded for one of the questions must be revised because only one of the options is the correct answer. 45. One of the questions in the NEET (UG) 2024 exam was as follows: “Given below are two statements: Statement I: Atoms are electrically neutral as they contain an equal number of positive and negative charges.
