In our view, the allegations in the FIR point out to (i) involvement of persons in criminal activity relating to scheduled offences; (ii) the generation as well as (iii)laundering of the proceeds of crime within the meaning of Section 3. This is in view F of the fact that wherever there are allegations of corruption, there is acquisition of proceeds of crime which itself tantamount to money- laundering. 105. A lot of heat and dust was generated about the ED registering an Information Report on 29.07.2021 without any material whatsoever G and thereafter indulging in a fishing expedition both by summoning the respondents and by seeking copies of various documents from the Special Court before which the complaints relating to the predicate offences are pending. But we do not see any substance in these arguments. The reason why we say so will be understood if we rewind and go back to a few facts. H Y. BALAJI v. KARTHIK DESARI & ANR. ETC. 1091 [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] 106. On 29.10.2015, Devasagayam made a complaint. It was A against ten different persons, but not against the Minister, his brother and his Secretary. But on 07/08.03.2016, one Gopi made a complaint naming the brother of the Minister and claimed that a total amount of more than Rs.2 crores was paid. Gopi then filed Criminal O.P. No.7503 of 2016 on the file of the High Court in which the High Court passed an B on 20.06.2016, to expand the investigation and go against the real culprits. But a Final Report under Section 173(2) of the Code was filed on 13.06.2017. This was followed by another complaint filed by V. Ganesh Kumar on 09.09.2017 in FIR No.298 of 2017. In this FIR, a Final Report was filed on 07.06.2018. Similarly, one Arulmani filed a complaint on 13.08.2018 in FIR No.344 of 2018 in which a Final Report was filed on C 12.04.2019. 107. Subsequently, at the instance of one R.B. Arun Kumar, further investigation was ed in FIR No.441 of 2015, by an of the High Court dated 27.11.2019. Thereafter, a discharge petition was filed by the Minister in one of those cases and after the same was dismissed, D he filed a revision before the High Court. During the pendency of the revision, a Final Report was filed under Section 173(8) in one of those cases. 108. Around the same time, writ petitions were filed pointing out that there was a huge jobs-for-cash scam. In those writ petitions, the E Assistant Commissioner of Police filed counter affidavits. 109. Thus, the information about all complaints, the nature of the complaints, the amount of money allegedly collected towards illegal gratification had all come into public domain. To say that the ED should have adopted an Ostrich like approach, without trying F to find out where and to whom the huge money generated in the scam had gone, is something unheard of. 110. In fact, ED was not trying to access any document which was inaccessible.
