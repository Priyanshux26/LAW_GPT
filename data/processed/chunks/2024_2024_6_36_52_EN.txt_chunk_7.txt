Their results were declared on 18.05.2023, after normalizing and merging the results of both the main examinations. The process of normalization of the results of the two main examinations was effected by the MPPSC in consultation with and under the guidance and advice of two experts. Normalization was undertaken in the context of the marks obtained by candidates in the two main examinations by applying a formula, so as to bring them all on an even keel. Thereby, 1983 candidates stood qualified for the interview. Out of the 1983 candidates declared qualified for the interview, 1,520 candidates figured in the list of 1918 candidates declared eligible earlier, on the strength of the first main examination, and the remaining 463 candidates emerged successful either in the special main examination or in the normalization process. Totally, 398 candidates out of the 1918 candidates, who were declared eligible for the interview earlier, stood ousted and were no longer eligible. 20. The MPPSC then issued Notification dated 23.06.2023, calling upon the 1983 selected candidates to appear for the interviews. Some of the ousted 398 candidates filed writ petitions before the High Court and were granted interim relief, by permitting them also to appear for the interviews. Interviews were conducted from 09.08.2023 to 19.10.2023. 21. The MPPSC filed Writ Appeal No. 2017 of 2023, aggrieved by the in Vaishali Wadhwani (supra), on the ground that it proceeded on the erroneous assumption that the normalization process was applied to the marks secured in the preliminary examination and not in the two main examinations held thereafter. By interim dated 19.12.2023, a Division Bench of the High Court stayed the dated 23.08.2023 passed in Vaishali Wadhwani (supra). Aggrieved thereby, Vaishali Wadhwani and others filed miscellaneous applications, seeking vacating of the stay granted by the Division Bench in Writ Appeal No. 2017 of 2023. These applications were dismissed on 12.02.2024. 22. We are informed that the State of Madhya Pradesh proceeded on the strength of the results declared after the normalization and also issued appointment s to the selected candidates, thereby 48 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports enabling them to join service. Insofar as the seven petitioners in SLP (C) No. 5817 of 2023 are concerned, the MPPSC stated that only three of them had cleared the preliminary examination, as per the pre-revised result dated 21.12.2020, and were eligible to write the main examination. However, one of them did not appear for the main examination while the other two did and failed. Thereafter, all seven of them were declared eligible, in terms of the revised preliminary examination result dated 10.10.2022, but they failed the special main examination and in the process of normalization held thereafter, as per the results declared on 18.05.2023. 23. Be it noted that Vaishali Wadhwani and others, the petitioners in Writ Petition No. 4783 of 2023 and batch, were successful before the High Court to some extent inasmuch as their writ petitions were partly allowed by the dated 23.08.2023, but directing the MPPSC to merge and normalize the two lists, i.e., the result of the first main examination and the result of the special main examination.
