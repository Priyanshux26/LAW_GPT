The period involved in the present appeal pertains to 01.03.2006 to 10.07.2006. During the audit of the accounts of the assessee, the department noticed that the assessee was manufacturing ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ and was claiming it as ‘chewing tobacco’. The stand of the assessee has been that they were manufacturing varieties of fl avoured ‘chewing tobacco’. Hence, the statement of the partner of the assessee came to be recorded on 15.02.2007, which has been noticed in paragraph 3 of show cause notice dated 30.03.2007. Hence, we do not propose to extract the same. A perusal of the said statement would indicate the manner in which the product has been manufactured. It is admitted in the statement given by the partner of the assessee, that raw tobacco is mixed with an additive mixture which is manufactured by mixing perfumery compounds received from the noticee’s Delhi Unit itself. He also admits that to this perfumery mixture, further compounds are added for making various types of tobacco to be manufactured. Based on this statement and precisely for the reason that the product manufactured by the assessee seems to not be ‘chewing tobacco’, aforesaid show cause notice dated 30.03.2007 came to be issued by calling upon the assessee to show cause as to why the short-paid duty amounting to Rs.4,28,65,508/- should not be recovered. The said show cause notice came to be adjudicated and the Commissioner confi rmed the said demand. 610 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 58. Being aggrieved by the dated 02.04.2008 passed by the Commissioner, appeal before the tribunal was fi led and as already noticed hereinabove, there were divergent views of the Member (Judicial) and Member (Technical). The judicial member at paragraph 16 of the held that the appellant (assessee) had properly classifi ed it as ‘chewing tobacco’ under CET SH 2403 9910 and applying the principles laid in M/s Urmin Products Private Limited (which is the subject matter of Civil Appeal No. 10159-161 of 2010) allowed the appeal whereas the technical member disagreed with the said view and held that the product manufactured by the appellant-assessee is to be classifi ed as ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ under CET SH 2403 9930 and should be assessed under the provision of Section 4 of CE Act, for the relevant period and with eff ect from 11.07.2006 under Section 4A when specifi c Notifi cation No.16/2006 dated 11.07.2006 came into force. 59. In the light of the diff erence of opinion the matter came to be referred to the opinion of a third member who concurred with the view expressed by the judicial member and held that the product manufactured by the petitioner was ‘chewing tobacco’ and not ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ as claimed by the Revenue.
