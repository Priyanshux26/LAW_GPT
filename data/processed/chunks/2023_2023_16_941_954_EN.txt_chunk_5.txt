133(W) of 2014 10 West Bengal Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Identifi cation) Act, 1994 948 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. belong to Scheduled Tribes community. The sale deeds were executed from the year 1983 onwards. It is only the sale deeds in question for which the issues are sought to be raised. 22. He further submitted that even as per the certifi cate issued by the Corporation, father of respondent No. 15 when entered into Government service as a driver of the Corporation, claiming himself to be belonging to general category. He never claimed that he was Scheduled Tribe. Once the father was not Scheduled Tribe, his legal heirs cannot possibly be. Even respondent No. 15 had sworn two affi davits dated 06.07.2000 and 02.08.2000 specifi cally stating that he belongs to General Category of ‘Tanti’ and does not belong to any Scheduled Tribe community. He even got the sale deed registered on 01.03.2000 without taking any permission. Further, one Bishwanath Roy made a complaint regarding the sale deeds in question, which was dismissed on 29.08.2000. However, on enquiry and fi nding that respondent No. 15 had already sworn affi davits that he belongs to general category, the same was closed. Subsequent thereto, respondent No. 15 sought to re-open the issue. He could not even produce his original caste certifi cate when the proceedings were conducted by certifi cate issuing authority. No record was found even in the offi ce. Once the family had been executing number of sale deeds claiming themselves to be of general category, the issue sought to be raised with reference to the sale deeds in question shows some oblique motive. 23. He further submitted that seeing the chequered history of the case, which is hanging fi re for the last 19 years, the issue needs to be closed as respondent No. 15 does not deserve any relief. The matter should not be sent back to either of the authorities as respondent No. 15 is only bent upon to harass the appellants who have not been able to raise construction though the property was purchased more than 19 years ago. On other portions of land sold by respondent No. 15, construction has already been raised. It was further submitted that the idea of enactment of the protective legislation of seeking permission for sale of land belonging to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes is only to save their property so that they are not forced to sell the same. But in the case in hand as the facts suggest, predecessor-in-interest of respondents No. 15 and 16 was owning huge property which he sold from time to time.

On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No. 15 to 18 submitted that there is no error in the passed by the High Court. Considering the amendment carried out vide Act No. XXXV of 201711 in the 1994 Act, the Committee has power to examine the issue, even in the case of cancellation of caste certifi cate.
