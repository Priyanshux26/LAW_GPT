From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14…” 43 [1959] SCR 279 44 [1974] 2 SCR 348 : (1974) 4 SCC 3 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 525 Sukanya Shantha v. Union of India & Ors. 29. The principle of non-arbitrariness and reasonableness was then emphasized in the seven-judge Bench decision in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India.45 It was held: “Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness, pervades Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in to be in conformity with Article 14. It must be “right and just and fair” and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive; otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied.” 30. To test the validity of laws, the twin test of intelligible differentia and reasonable nexus held ground. Whether the test of arbitrariness is a valid principle under Article 14 led to a conflicting set of decisions.46 In Shayara Bano v. Union of India,47 in testing the validity of Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 which validates the triple talaq, Justice R.F. Nariman endorsed the test of manifest arbitrariness. It was held: “The test of manifest arbitrariness, therefore, as laid down in the aforesaid s would apply to invalidate legislation as well as subordinate legislation under Article 14. Manifest arbitrariness, therefore, must be something done by the legislature capriciously, irrationally and/ or without adequate determining principle. Also, when something is done which is excessive and disproportionate, such legislation would be manifestly arbitrary. We are, therefore, of the view that arbitrariness in the sense of manifest arbitrariness as pointed out by us above would apply to negate legislation as well under Article 14.” 45 [1978] 2 SCR 621 : (1978) 1 SCC 248 46 The conflicting s have been summarized in Association for Democratic Reforms v. Union of India, 2024 INSC 113 47 [2017] 9 SCR 797 : (2017) 9 SCC 1 526 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 31. A formalistic understanding of the classification test was then critiqued by this Court in Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India.48 The Court was dealing with a challenge to the constitutionality of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Act, 1860, to the extent that it criminalized consensual sexual conduct between adults. In his concurring opinion, one of us (Justice DY Chandrachud) held: “Equating the content of equality with the reasonableness of a classification on which a law is based advances the cause of legal formalism.
