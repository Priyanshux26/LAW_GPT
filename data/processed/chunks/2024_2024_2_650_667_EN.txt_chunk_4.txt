In the aforesaid bunch of appeals and the Special Leave Petition, in which leave was granted, the High Court had disposed of all the appeals, merely relying upon its earlier dated 14.07.2009 656 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in S.B. Civil Second Appeal No.6/2008 titled as The Tehsildar, Urban Improvement Trust and another v. Late Smt. Ganga Bai Menariya through legal representatives. The aforesaid appeal decided by the High Court is subject matter of consideration before this Court in C.A. No.722 of 2012, which is being dealt with in the present . ARGUMENTS Civil Appeal No. 722 of 2012 11. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the findings recorded by the First Appellate Court, as upheld by the High Court, are erroneous. In fact, the and decree of the Trial Court was passed while properly appreciating the legal position and the evidence produced on record. It is a case in which the respondents- plaintiffs claimed that they had been granted patta (lease) of the land by Gram Panchayat, Titardi in the year 1959 and on the basis thereof, they were continuing in possession. However, the fact remains that the land was still being shown in the ownership of the Government. It was ear-marked for grazing cattles (pasture land). The Gram Panchayat did not have any authority to lease out the same. It cannot even change user of the land. Simpliciter a suit for permanent injunction was filed without seeking a declaration of the rights vested in the respondents-plaintiffs on the basis of documents produced by them on record, which was not maintainable. Gram Panchayat, Titardi from which the respondents-plaintiffs were claiming rights in the property, was not even impleaded as party. The patta (lease) in favour of the respondents-plaintiffs was sought to be proved merely by producing two witnesses, who were claimed to be the members of the Panchayat at the relevant time but not signatory to the document. The record from Gram Panchayat was not summoned. The High Court had failed to frame any substantial question of law. C.A. Nos.8977/2012, 468/2013, 524/2013, 467/2013 and Civil Appeal @ S.L.P. (C)No.25200/2013 12. Additional argument raised in the bunch of other appeals was that the Gram Panchayat had granted patta (lease) in favour of the respondents therein in contravention of Rule 266 of the 1961 Rules7 7 The Rajasthan Panchayat (General) Rules, 1961 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 657 The Tehsildar, Urban Improvement Trust And Anr. v. Ganga Bai Menariya (Dead) Through Lrs. And Others in terms of which the panchayat land could be sold by way of private negotiation only in case it was not possible to fetch reasonable price if the land was put to auction. Specific reasons were required to be recorded. The respondents-plaintiffs being in illegal possession of the land, notices were rightly issued for their eviction. It was after following the due process of law, which could not be challenged merely by filing a suit for injunction. 13. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that it was claimed that the respondents-plaintiffs had title of the property by way of lease executed by Gram Panchayat, Titardi on 13.12.1959.
