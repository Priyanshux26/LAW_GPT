Digital Supreme Court Reports (a) Consideration as to whether Tiger Safaris and Zoos are on the same footing or not. 78. In this background, we will have to consider the question as to whether the ‘zoo’ as defined under Section 2(39) and dealt with under Chapter IVA of the WLP Act and the ‘Tiger Safaris’ as conceptualized by the NTCA would stand on a same footing or not. 79. We have already reproduced the definition of ‘zoo’ as defined under Section 2(39) of the WLP Act. The definition of ‘zoo’ itself would show that it is meant to be an establishment, whether stationary or mobile, where captive animals are kept for exhibiting to the public or ex-situ conservation and include a circus and off-exhibit facilities such as rescue centres and conservation breeding centres. However, it does not include the establishment of a licensed dealer in captive animals. It could thus be seen that though a ‘zoo’ as contemplated under Chapter IVA of the WLP Act also deals with conservation, it emphasizes on ex situ conservation. 80. Proviso to Section 33(a) of the WLP Act specifically prohibits any construction of tourist lodges, including Government lodges for commercial purposes, hotels, zoos and safari parks inside a sanctuary except with the prior approval of the National Board. It could thus be seen that, insofar as the area which is covered under a sanctuary is concerned, there will be no difficulty to hold that a safari cannot be constructed within the said area unless there is a prior approval of the National Board. However, the question that falls for consideration in the present case is, as to whether a ‘Tiger Safari’ would be permissible in the buffer zone or not. 81. For the first time, a ‘safari’ was defined in the ‘Guidelines for Safari Parks which are Working either as Zoos or as Extension to Zoos, 1996’. It reads thus : “Safaries are specialized zoos where the captive animals are housed in any large naturalistic enclosures to and the visitors are allowed to enter the enclosure to view the animals in a mechanized vehicle or a pre-determined route from close quarters.” 82. It could thus be seen from the title of the said Guidelines itself that the same would be applicable only insofar as safari parks which are working either as zoos or as an extension to zoos.

Undisputedly, the ‘Tiger Safaris’ which are conceptualized by the NTCA are not for the parks which are working either as zoos or as an extension to zoos.
