Separation of judicial power is a significant constitutional principle under the Constitution of India. F 126.3. Separation of powers between three organs—the legislature, executive and judiciary—is also nothing but a consequence of principles of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

They are (1) Prohibition against dis crimination in the preparation of, or eligibility for inclusion in, the electoral rolls, on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or any of them; and (2) adult sufferage.” The Court really was not concerned with the question as to whether D Article 326 provided for a Constitutional right to vote. 96.
