b. The plaintiff filed the present suit on 29.07.2011 with the prayer of declaration of title and permanent injunction. Significantly, there was no prayer for possession in the suit as originally filed. The suit was filed asserting title on the basis that plaintiff’s collaterals were the original owners of the suit properties and that the collateral branch remined heirless and therefore the suit property devolved on the plaintiff and further that the plaintiff was in possession of the suit properties. The Trial Court found that petitioners-defendants were in possession from 1981- 1982 continuously and revenue records stood in the name of the petitioners-defendants since 1981-1982. All through the pendency of the suit before the Trial Court the plaintiff did not seek any amendment of the plaint to seek the relief of possession. Thus, the suit as framed was primarily one for declaration of title and consequential relief for injunction. The respondent-plaintiff filed an appeal before the First Appellate Court and during the pendency of the appeal filed an application for amendment of the plaint to incorporate the relief of possession. The said application for amendment was allowed by the First Appellate Court on 22.06.2018. Therefore, the prayer for amendment was made as late as 2018 though, the petitioners-defendants had been in possession since 1981-1982. Thus, the suit was barred by limitation. c. The respondent – plaintiff pleaded case with regard to cause of action was that the petitioners-defendants managed to get change of Khatha in the name of the petitioners-defendants in the revenue records and this gave rise to the cause of action. It is the concurrent finding of the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court that the revenue records stood in the name of the petitioners-defendants since 1981-1982. The Trial Court noted at page 67 of its that the mutation took place in favour of [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1895 Mallavva and Anr. v. Kalsammanavara Kalamma (Since Dead) by Legal Heirs & Ors. petitioners-defendants in the year 1981-1982. The finding of the Trial Court in this regard is under: “All the documents i.e., RORs and Patta Book of the suit properties revealed that in the year 1981- 1982 the Jummani Mallavva had consented to the defendants to mutate their names in respect of the suit schedule properties and from the 1981-1682 onwards, the name of the defendants are appearing in the revenue records of the suit properties.” Therefore, the cause of action as far back as 1981- 1982 and the suit for declaration of title (primary relief) was barred under Article 58 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act. 5. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned counsel prayed that there being merit in his appeal, the same may be allowed and the impugned passed by the High Court be set aside.
