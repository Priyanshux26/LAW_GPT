This records reasons and decides the applications for stay of selection and appointment of the Election Commissioners1, in the writ petitions filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India2, inter alia, challenging the vires of Section 7(1) of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service, and Term of Office) Act, 2023.3 2. The primary grounds of challenge are twofold. First, Section 7(1) of the 2023 Act dilutes, if not amends or modifies, the of this Court’s Constitution Bench in Anoop Baranwal v. Union of India4, by substituting the Chief Justice of India5 with a Union 1 For short, “EC”. 2 For short, “Constitution”. 3 For short, “2023 Act”. 4 [2023] 9 SCR 1 : (2023) 6 SCC 161. 5 For short, “CJI”. 884 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Cabinet Minister nominated by the Prime Minister in the Selection Committee for the post of the Chief Election Commissioner6 and the ECs. Secondly, the provision has a direct and potential impact on the conduct of transparent, free and fair elections, one of the foundational requirements of democracy. 3. That apart, the selection process of the ECs, as adopted in the present case, has been challenged on the ground of procedural irregularity, affecting the fairness, transparency and objectivity in the selection process in question. The Leader of Opposition in the House of the People7 was not furnished necessary details of the six shortlisted candidates in advance to effectively participate in the selection process8. The names and details were statedly furnished minutes before the meeting for the selection of the ECs was held on 14.03.20249. Thus, he has been denied the opportunity to choose and have his voice heard. Further, the writ petition challenging the vires of the 2023 Act was sub-judice before this Court since 02.01.2024, and therefore soon after the resignation of one of the ECs, applications for stay were filed, mentioned and directed to be listed for hearing before this Court on 15.03.2024.
