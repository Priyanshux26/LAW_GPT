30. We have already referred to the manner the original complaint was disposed of earlier. The submissions made on behalf of the parties, the documents annexed thereto and above all, the dated 12.07.2012 of the learned CJM, would reveal that the second complaint was filed on the same set of facts contained in the first complaint and the second one was filed after the dismissal of the protest petition and the consequential acceptance of the Final Report in the first complaint. It is not in dispute that subsequent to the rejection of the protest petition and acceptance of the Final Report (Annexure P-5) as per dated 06.06.2011, the matter was not taken forward further by the respondent/complainant. The second complaint was filed thereafter on 20.07.2011 reiterating, rather, reproducing the complaint dated 11.11.2010 and further adding allegations, virtually made by way of the protest petition dated 05.05.2011 that the investigation pursuant to the original complaint was done perfunctorily. It is to be noted that the said allegation against the investigation was also rejected earlier as per dated 06.06.2011 holding that the investigation did not suffer from any infirmity and further that it did not deserve further investigation. Now, a comparison of the first complaint dated 11.11.2010 and the second complaint dated 20.07.2011 shows that they contain the same set of allegations against the same accused as has been observed by the learned CJM in the dated 12.07.2012. The learned CJM, in the dated 12.07.2012 after referring to various decisions observed and held thus:- “After the original complaint has been duly investigated by the police and Final Report submitted therein has [2024] 12 S.C.R. 25 Subrata Choudhury @ Santosh Choudhury & Ors. v. The State of Assam & Anr. been accepted by the Court in a Judicial Proceeding; therefore, in my considered view it cannot be re-opened by the means of filing of a second complaint in respect of the same facts and circumstances. In this connection, reliance can be placed n (Sic: in) a of the Hon’ble Patna High Court reported in 1981 CRL. LAW JOURNAL 795 Bhuveneswar Prasad Singh and others Vs. State of Bihar and another. The Hon’ble Patna High Court relying upon a decision of the Hon’ble Apex Court reported in AIR 1968 Supreme Court 117 Abhinandan Jha Vs. Dinesh Mishra had held – Where the Final Report by police holding the case against the accused persons to be untrue; was accepted by the Magistrate earlier, than the complaint petition was filed against the accused, the Magistrate would not be justified in taking cognizance on the basis of the complaint petition in respect of the same facts constituting the offence which were mentioned in the final form where a Judicial was passed by accepting final form.” 31. The circumstances expatiated above and a scanning of the decision in Samta Naidu’s case and the decisions referred to in the aforesaid paragraphs thereunder would constrain us to say, with respect, that the understanding of the settled position in regard to the maintainability of a second complaint or second protest petition of the High Court, as reflected mainly in paragraph 20 of the impugned is not true to the position settled by this Court.
