The object of introduction of nomination facility vide the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1999 was only to provide an impetus to the investment climate and ease the cumbersome process of obtaining various letters of succession, from diff erent authorities upon the shareholder’s death. 46. Additionally, there is a complex layer of commercial considerations that are to be taken into account while dealing with the issue of nomination pertaining to companies or until legal heirs are able to suffi ciently establish their right of succession to the company. Therefore, off ering a discharge to the entity once the nominee is in picture is quite distinct from granting ownership of securities to nominees instead of the legal heirs. Nomination process therefore does not override the succession laws. Simply said, there is no third mode of succession that the scheme of the Companies Act, 1956 22 (2011) 2 SCC 132 SHAKTI YEZDANI & ANR. v. JAYANAND JAYANT 723 SALGAONKAR & ORS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] (pari materia provisions in Companies Act, 2013) and Depositories Act, 1996 aims or intends to provide. 47. Upon a careful perusal of the provisions within the Companies Act, it is clear that it does not deal with the law of succession. Therefore, a departure from this settled position of law is not at all warranted. The impugned decision takes the correct view. The appeal is accordingly dismissed without any on cost.
