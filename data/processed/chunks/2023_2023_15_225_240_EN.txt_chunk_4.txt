Scope of Review: 7. At the outset, it may be stated that the power to review its s has been conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 137 of the Constitution of India. Of course, that power is subject to the provisions of any law made by the Parliament or the Rules made under Article 145.Supreme Court in exercise of the powers conferred under Article 145 of the Constitution of India has framed the Supreme Court Rules, 2013. The XLVII of Part IV thereof deals with the provisions of Review. Accordingly, in a Civil Proceeding, an application for review is entertained only on the grounds mentioned in XLVII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in a Criminal Proceeding on the ground of an error apparent on the face of record. However, it may be noted that neither XLVII CPC nor XLVII of Supreme Court Rules limits the remedy of review only to the parties to the under review. Even a third party to the proceedings, if he considers himself to be an “aggrieved person,” may take recourse to the remedy of review petition. The quintessence is that the person should be aggrieved by the and passed by this Court in some respect.1 In view of the said legal position, the Review Petitioners who claimed to be the “aggrieved persons” by the impugned dated 06.09.2022, were permitted to fi le Review Petitions and were heard by the Court. 8.
