Held (per Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J.) (Concurring with Dr. Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI): The expression “claiming through or under” in ss.8 and 45 is intended to provide a derivative right; and it does not enable a non-signatory to become a party to the arbitration agreement – The decision in Chloro Controls tracing the Group of Companies doctrine through the phrase “claiming through or under” in ss.8 and 45 is erroneous – The expression ‘party’ in s.2(1) (h) and s.7 is distinct from “persons claiming through or under them”.
