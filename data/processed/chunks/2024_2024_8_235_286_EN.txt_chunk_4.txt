The petitioner appeared at Vesu Police Station on 11th December, 2023 with a copy of the under contempt dated 8th December, 2023 intending to join and cooperate with the investigation. Shri R.Y. Raval, Investigating Officer(contemnor-respondent No. 4) arrested the petitioner and thereafter, released him on bail upon execution of the requisite bail bonds in terms of dated 8th December, 2023. On the very same day, the petitioner was served with a notice under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter being referred to as ‘CrPC’) requiring him to remain present at the police station before the Investigating Officer for recording of further statement. When the petitioner appeared at the police station, another notice dated 12th December, 2023 was served upon him requiring him to remain present before the Court of concerned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate for the purpose of seeking remand. The contents of the notice dated 12th December, 2023 are relevant and shall have a material bearing on the outcome of the instant contempt petition and hence, the same are reproduced below for the sake of ready reference: - “ N O T I C E It is hereby given to you this notice in written form that, for the matter of offence committed u/s. 420, 120(b) of Indian Penal Code registered before Vesu Police Station vide Part-A-11210068230366/2023 Complainant Abhishek Vinodkumar Goswami aged: 28 years, occupation: Business Real Estate Residing at C/405, Surya Palace, Ct 242 [2024] 8 S.C.R.

It is apposite to note that this notice makes a distinct reference to the dated 8th December, 2023 passed by this Court. However, the notice is blissfully silent on the aspect that the petitioner had not cooperated with the investigation. 7. In compliance of the said notice, the petitioner appeared before learned 6th Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Surat(‘contemnor- respondent No.7’) on 13th December, 2023 on which date, the Investigating Officer, filed an application seeking his police custody remand for seven days. When the remand application was taken up, learned counsel representing the petitioner produced a copy of the under contempt dated 8th December, 2023 and made a fervent submission that the Supreme Court, while providing interim protection to the petitioner had not granted any liberty to the Investigating Officer to seek police custody remand and thus, the application seeking remand ought to be rejected.
