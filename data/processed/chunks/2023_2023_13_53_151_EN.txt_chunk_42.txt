Nothing is mentioned as to why the proposal indicated in Page-12 was changed on page-13 diff erently. 84. Admittedly, what is stated in page-13 was passed in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha and then it became the Act 44 of 2016 and came into eff ect on 01.09.2016. 85. But the important thing to note is that this Report does not indicate that the Committee had even considered Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which provides the general law of right to redeem a mortgaged asset of a mortgager vis-a-vis the provisions of the SARFAESI Act. 112 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 86. It no where says that there was an intention to bring about a change with regard to the time before which a mortgagor can exercise his right to redeem the mortgage. 87. Even the heading of Para 24 of the Report which says “Provisions to stop secure creditor to lease or assignment or sale in the prescribed conditions - Amendment to Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act” seems to suggest that the focus of the Committee was on the date when the secured creditor’s right to lease or assignment or sale would stop. 88. In our considered opinion, it is clear that the legislature did not have any intention to deal with the right of mortgagor to redeem the mortgage when they amended Sec.13(8) or to modify it in any manner; and amendment cannot be said to have intended to modify the existing law which continued even when the un-amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act was in force. The amended Sec.13(8) was intended to only deal with the date when the secured creditor’s right to transfer the secured asset should stop and nothing more. xxx xxx xxx 93. The view taken by the High Court for the State of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in M/s. Concern Ready Mix [(2019) 3 ALD 384 : Law Finder Doc Id # 1380151] commends itself to us and we accept and approve the same. 94. We shall now consider the of Supreme Court in Shakeena [(2019) 5 RCR (Civil) 689 (SC)]cited by the counsel for 1st respondent. In that case, sale certifi cate had been issued in favour of the auction purchasers on 06.01.2006 and a Writ Petition was fi led on 19.01.2006 challenging the auction and it was registered on 18.9.2007. The Court held that the appellants had failed to make a valid tender of amounts due or exercise their right of redemption in a manner known to law until the registration of the sale certifi cate on 18.09.2007 and that the right of redemption stood obliterated on 18.09.2007. The statement therein in para 29 that as per the amended provision stringent conditions have been stipulated that the tender of dues to the secured creditor shall be at CELIR LLP v. BAFNA MOTORS (MUMBAI) PVT. 113 LTD. & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] any time before the date of publication of notice for public auction does not, in our opinion, lead to an expression of opinion by the Supreme Court that the law of redemption as per Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act would not apply in view of amendment to Section 13(8).
