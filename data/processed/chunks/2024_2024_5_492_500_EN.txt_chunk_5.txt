2 Amar Nath v. Kewla Devi [2014] 14 SCR 677 : (2014) 11 SCC 273, para 17 3 Karbalai Begum v. Mohd. Sayeed [1981] 1 SCR 863 : (1980) 4 SCC 396, para 12-13 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 499 Prashant Singh & Ors. Etc. v. Meena & Ors. Etc. 15. In all fairness, learned senior counsel for the appellants has placed reliance on a decision of this Court in Sita Ram vs. Chhota Bhondey & Ors.,4 for contending that during the pendency of consolidation proceedings, the Authority under the Act assumes the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to determine all types of rights including the dispute regarding title over the land. In our considered opinion that is not the ratio decidendi of the decision in Sita Ram (supra). That was a case where the dispute related to sirdari holdings which were subject matter of the proceedings under the 1953 Act. These proceedings attained finality when the writ petition challenging the of the Deputy Director of Consolidation was dismissed in limine and that was further upheld by this Court under Article 133 of the Constitution of India. Thereafter, the unsuccessful party filed a Civil Suit seeking a declaration that the passed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation (which had been upheld by the High Court and this Court) was without jurisdiction. The said suit was contested with an objection that it was barred by Section 49 of the 1953 Act. In this backdrop, this Court very aptly held that the subsequent civil suit was barred under Section 49 of the 1953 Act. The facts will speak for themselves as to how Section 49 of the 1953 Act was construed by this Court in the light of the events noticed above. 16. However, that is not the factual situation here. We may hasten to add that in the present case, Kalyan Singh filed the suit for declaration questioning the deletion of his name from the revenue record as a co-owner. As held earlier in paragraph 14 of this , the dated 08.05.1960 of the Consolidation Officer in the instant case was totally without jurisdiction and not being an within the framework of the 1953 Act, and it could not bind the rights of Kalyan Singh. 17. As regard to the contention that the High Court ought not have interfered with the Board’s remanding the case to the Trial Court to examine the legal issue of applicability of Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, the same just deserves to be noticed and rejected. We say so for the reason that once Kalyan Singh is held to be co-owner in the subject property, the exclusive possession of the land, if any, with Ramji Lal, was joint in nature and it was for and on behalf of all the co-owners. Kalyan Singh was already deemed to 4 [1990] Supp. 2 SCR 184 : 1991 Supp (1) SCC 556 500 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports be in joint possession of the subject land in the eyes of law, hence he was not required to seek a decree of possession qua his share in the suit land.
