Conclusion and Directions 17. We, thus, find it quite unsafe to convict the Appellant on the basis of such laconic evidence. Rather, we deem it appropriate to allow this appeal and acquit the Appellant in FIR Case Crime No. 84/1994. Accordingly, the of conviction by the High Court dated 10.12.2009 is set aside, and that of the Trial Court dated 13.10.1995 is restored in so far as the Appellant is concerned. The bail bonds, if any, furnished by the Appellant are hereby cancelled. 18. The present appeal is allowed in the above terms. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain 4 Darshan Singh v. State of Punjab (2010) 2 SCC 333; Ballu@Balram v. State of Madhya Pradesh, Crl. Appeal No. 1167.2018.
