We say nothing more on this aspect except that while determining the market value we are really concerned with the potentiality of the land. If except to the extent of 15 meters from the defined boundary of the water course the other land was not in the no construction zone, there is no reason why the same market value could not be awarded. In view of the above, considering the potentiality of the land and its situs, except for the lands upto 15 meters from the defined boundary of the water course, we are inclined to award Rs.100/- per sq.ft. for 68.3% of the total admeasuring area. It should not be forgotten that the LAO treated the land in Survey No. 7 Akoli Bk. No.1, namely, the appellant’s land alike. The Reference Court also awarded them @ Rs. 100/-. The High Court proceeded on the basis that the land was purportedly in the blue zone and set aside the of the Reference Court and the award. 57. We are inclined to restore the award insofar as the land if any within the 15 meters of the defined boundary of the water course and for the rest of the land in Survey No.1 belonging to the appellant for the 68.3% of the balance area, we award the rate of Rs.100/- per sq.ft. 58. LAC No. 209 of 2002 dated 10.08.2006, is the Reference Court which is under consideration in C.A. No. @ SLP (C) No. 6817 of 2023 and C.A. No. @ SLP (C) No. 2324 of 2023 which are part of this very batch of matters. The Land involved in the said reference case is situated in village Akoli Khurd bearing Survey Nos. 6, 7 and 60. Here again, the Section 4 notification was issued on 03.06.1999. The lands were no doubt converted to non-agricultural use on 03.03.1983. 59. The plot area involved in LAC No. 209/2002 is 33415.50 sq. mts and the applicants were claiming for the plotted area and not claiming compensation for the open area and roads. In LAC No. 209/2002, the LAO awarded Rs. 72,400 per hectare resulting in a reference under Section 18. There is no case for the government that the land [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2273 Kazi Akiloddin v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. is adjacent to Morna river. The Land in question in LAC No. 209/2002 was situated near several educational and other religious institutions. The claim for enhancement in LAC No. 209/2002 was based on Exh. 78 dated 10/11.05.1999 where plot no. 50 Survey No. 7/2 of Akoli Bk. was sold @ Rs. 175/- per sq. ft. The LAO admits that the Akoli (Bk) and Akoli Khurd are adjoining twin villages. It is also recorded that the lands lying therein are similar in nature. Based on the previous award Rs.100/- per sq. ft. was awarded. The High Court upheld the said award. Exh. 75 was the sale deed of 12.02.2009 of plot no. 75 of Akola Survey No.8 and Survey No. 5/1.
