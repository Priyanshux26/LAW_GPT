21. The learned counsel would submit that the High Court rightly observed that the dated 27.01.1998 passed by the Rent Controller D in the first round of litigation could be said to be under the provisions of 17 Rule 3 of the CPC and, if that be so, then the finding that the original plaintiff i.e. Samey Singh was not able to establish the landlord tenant relationship could be said to be on merits. He would submit that once such finding has come on record, the appellants later in point of E time claiming through Samey Singh as successors in interest could not have preferred a fresh eviction petition on the very same grounds as the same would be hit by the principles of res judicata. He would submit that the High Court rightly rejected the plaint of the eviction petition under the provisions of 7 Rule 11(d) of the CPC. 22. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent No. 1 in support F of submissions has placed reliance on the following decisions:- 1. Union of India v. Nanak Singh, AIR 1968 SC 1370 : (1968) 2 SCR 887 2. Satyadhyan Ghosal & Ors. v. Smt. Deorajin Devi & Anr., AIR 1960 SC 941 : (1960) 3 SCR 590 G 3. Har Dayal v. Ram Ghulam, AIR (31) 1944 Oudh 39 4.

Rattan Singh, (1964) 1 SCR 259 7. Gulabchand Chhotalal Parikh v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1965 SC 1153 Analysis B 23. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the only question that falls for our consideration is whether the High Court was justified in rejecting the plaint of the eviction petition on the ground that the second eviction petition was barred by the principles of res judicata. 24. 7 Rule 11 of the CPC reads as follows:- C “11. Rejection of plaint.— The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases:— (a) where it does not disclose a cause of action; (b) where the relief claimed is undervalued, and the plaintiff, on D being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so; (c) where the relief claimed is properly valued, but the plaint is returned upon paper insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the requisite stamp-paper E within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so; (d) where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law; (e) where it is not filed in duplicate; F (f) where the plaintiff fails to comply with the provisions of rule 9: Provided that the time fixed by the Court for the correction of the valuation or supplying of the requisite stamp-paper shall not be extended unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded, is satisfied that the plaintiff was prevented by any cause of an exceptional G nature for correcting the valuation or supplying the requisite stamp- paper, as the case may be, within the time fixed by the Court and that refusal to extend such time would cause grave injustice to the plaintiff.” (Emphasis supplied) H PREM KISHORE & ORS.
