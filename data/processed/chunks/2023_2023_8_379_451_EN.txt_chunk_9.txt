On 05.11.2001, the parties entered C into the Third Supplementary Agreement, which specified a reduction in supply of power by the claimant to the extent of 19.8 MW from March 2004 until the end of the PPA term, i.e., 13.08.2014 This 19.8 MW quantum was designated as ‘New Rated Capacity’. 4.3. It appears that in view of power being costly, the Government D of Goa intended to stop the purchase from the claimant and addressed a letter to that effect on 20.03.2013. However, in view of a provision in the PPA for use of alternate fuel, by its communication dated 21.03.2013, the claimant gave its proposal to the Government of Goa to supply power by using Regassified Liquefied Natural Gas6, which was being brought E up to Goa by GAIL by its pipeline. The claimant gave a formula by which the per unit cost of power would be billed by it to the Government of Goa. This particular aspect relating to the claimant’s proposal to switch over to the alternate fuel and charges payable in that regard has formed a major part of contentions in this case. Hence, a little elaboration shall be apposite. F 4.3.1.On 26.04.2013, the Government of Goa replied to the claimant’s letter dated 21.03.2013, inter alia, in the following terms: - “In view of your offer under reference, the Government has decided to continue to purchase power @ Rs. 8.58 per unit G w.e.f. 01/04/2013 as per your formula proposed in the letter dated 21/03/2013 considering the present rates of fuel and dollar. The same may be noted for records and incorporated in your power bills. The revised fixed rate shall be applicable from 1st April 2013.” 6 ‘RLNG’, for short. H 392 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 4.3.2.On 30.04.2013, the claimant, however, sought a clarification from the Government regarding the formula-based tariff payable for the supply of electricity, inter alia, in the following words: - “1. With regard to the price mentioned in our proposal dated 21.03.2013, the tariff of Rs.8.58/unit is based on the B prevailing RLNG price ($17.2/mmbtu) and INR/USD exchange rate (1 $ = Rs 54) and is therefore not fixed. The same shall vary depending upon the fuel price in the market and the INR/USD exchange rate.” 4.3.3.It has been the case of the claimant that initially, the C Government of Goa agreed to a fixed per unit price but, when it was clarified that the price would not be fixed, the Government agreed to purchase the same considering the prevailing rates of fuel and dollar upto the expiry of the PPA while requiring that for this purpose, documentation showing the price of fuel and dollar be incorporated in the bills raised by the claimant. In this regard, a communication received D by the claimant from the Chief Electrical Engineer dated 23.05.2013 has been relied upon. For its relevance, this communication dated 23.05.2013 is reproduced, in extenso, as under : - “GOVERNMENT OF GOA ELECTRICTY DEPARTMENT E OFFICE OF THE CHIEF ELECTRICAL ENGINEER No.
