Therefore, in our in Section 35 of FEMA, any “” or “decision” of the Appellate Tribunal would mean all decisions or s of the Appellate Tribunal and all such decisions or E s are, subject to limitation, appealable to the High Court on a question of law.” [emphasis supplied] 125. While holding that the word “any” in the context would mean “all”, this Court observed that a right of appeal is always conferred by a F statute. It has been held that, while conferring such right, a statute may impose restrictions, like limitation or pre-deposit of penalty or it may limit the area of appeal to questions of law or sometime to substantial questions of law.

The expression “at any time” finding place in Condition 6 has to mean, in the context in which it has been C used, “at any point of time”, the effect of which is that the required length must be maintained all the time. The accomplishment of object of the Act, one of which is safety in the mines, requires taking of such a view, especially in the backdrop of repeated mine disasters which have been taking, off and on, heavy toll of lives of the miners. It may be pointed out that the D word ‘any’ has a diversity of meaning and in Black’s Law Dictionary it has been stated that this word may be employed to indicate ‘all’ or ‘every’, and its meaning will depend “upon the context and subject-matter of the statute”.
