It is noted that the cited portion from Ram Niwas (supra) seems to be grammatically incorrect. H 410 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A “… I have heard learned counsel for the parties. The controversy involved in these writ petitions is covered by a in the case of Amarjit Kaur v. State of Punjab and others, 1988 (4) SLR 199 and a Division Bench of this Court B dated 26.5.2006 passed in CWP No. 8356 of 2006 (Ram Niwas v. State of Haryana) as also a of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Rathi Alloys and Steel Ltd. v. C.C.E. (1990) 2 SCC 324. In the case of Ram Niwas (supra), following observations have been made:- C “….Firstly, in law there is administrative hierarchy which was not to be respect and any successor cannot set aside the passed by his predecessor. Secondly, there is no provision under the Punjab Police Rules, 1934, as applicable to Haryana or in any instructions or subordinate legislation providing for review of an D passed by the predecessor in office. It is well settled that power or review cannot be exercised unless it is expressly provided by the Statute. In this regard, reliance may be placed on a of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Rathi Alloys and Steel Ltd. v. C.C.E., (1990) 2 SCC E 324. Our view also finds support from the of this Court in the case of Amarjit Kaur v. State of Punjab and others, 1988 (4) SLR 199….” Following the aforesaid , CWP No. 9973 of 2007 and CWP No. 12095 of 2007 were allowed by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide dated 23.3.2009. Ratio of all F these s is that the predecessor of an Officer in the hierarchy of service has no authority to review his s.” (sic) 7. Evincibly, the learned Single Judge concluded, in essence, that G the original expunction could not be held to be illegal, and the subsequent reconstruction of the remarks would be incorrect in view of the pronouncements of law referred to by him. 8. The respondent-State, aggrieved, preferred Letters Patent Appeal No.406 of 2011 (O & M) which was allowed by dated H 25.04.2011 [2011 SCC OnLine P&H 4687] setting aside AISH MOHAMMAD v. STATE OF HARYANA AND ORS. 411 [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] dated 27.01.2010 of the learned Single Judge, thereby restoring the A of the Director General of Police, Haryana dated 30.10.2006. The of the learned Division Bench is impugned before us. SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANT: 9. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the B impugned is unsustainable for the reason that the main ground for allowing the appeal of the respondent-State was that the of the Inspector General of Police dated 28.01.2005was completely against the verdict of the learned Civil Court refusing to expunge the adverse remarks, which was not only highly improper but totally unwarranted and the Director General of Police rightly set aside the of his C subordinate. It was submitted that the learned Division Bench failed to consider that the Director General of Police did not have any power of review as per the Punjab Police Rules, 1934 which applied to the State of Haryana.
