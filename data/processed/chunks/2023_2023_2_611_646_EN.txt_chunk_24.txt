142-Emp. dated 1stNovember, 2007 provides in no unclear terms that 97-Emp. would not be applicable to employees of local authorities. D It is trite that the effect of the clarification of any document is always retrospective and would relate back to the date of the notification in respect of which the clarification is issued, vide Ashok Lenka vs. Rishi Dikshit, AIR 2006 SC 2382. The clarificatory Circular, i.e., Circular No. 142-Emp. dated 1stNovember, 2007 has got no independent E existence. It merely defines the scope of operation of Circular No. 97- Emp. dated 6thJune, 2005. Therefore Circular No. 97-Emp. read with Circular No. 142-Emp. concern the procedure governing compassionate appointment, only qua State Government employees. Further, applications for compassionate appointment are to be considered in light of the policy holding the field on the date on which the F application is filed. In the present case, the applications were filed in the year 2006. Therefore, they would have to be decided in light of Circular No. 97-Emp. read with Circular No. 142-Emp. Given that the said Circular does not govern compassionate appointment to posts under local authorities, compassionate appointment cannot be granted to posts under G local authorities. 16.3. It is the case of the Respondents-Writ Petitioners herein that though Circular No. 97-Emp. read with Circular No. 142-Emp is not applicable to local authorities, their applications for compassionate appointment ought to have been considered in light of 301-Emp., 302- H THE STATE OF WEST BENGAL v. DEBABRATA TIWARI & 645 ORS. ETC. ETC. [B. V. NAGARATHNA, J.] Emp. and 303-Emp. which, according to the Respondents-Writ Petitioners A is applicable to all departments and authorities covered under the Act of 1999. However, in our view, the said Circulars were not understood or read to be a scheme governing all employees of other establishments governed by the Act of 1999. We say so for the following reasons: i) Circular No. 303-Emp. provides that any Department which B has vacancy in the Exempted Category of posts will provide employment to the wife/son/daughter/near relation of the employee who died in harness. Use of the word ‘Department’ would indicate that the said Circular would govern compassionate appointment to Departments of the C State Government and not to local authorities. ii) The meaning of the word ‘Department’ would have to be gathered, having regard to the fact that the immediate notification subsequent to 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303- Emp., being 97-Emp. dated 6thJune, 2005 notifies the D departments in whose vacancies the appointments would be granted. The Departments are of the State. iii) If Circular Nos. 301-Emp, 302-Emp and 303-Emp. are to be read so as to cover all establishments of the Act of 1999, then 97-Emp. dated 6thJune, 2005, should provide for E appointment in the establishment covered by the Act of 1999 concerned. It does not do so. Therefore, Circular Nos. 301- Emp, 302-Emp and 303-Emp. cannot be held to be applicable to local authorities. 16.4. The existence of a policy issued by the State Government is a sine qua non for making appointments on compassionate basis, vide F Mumtaz Yunus Mulani (Smt.)
