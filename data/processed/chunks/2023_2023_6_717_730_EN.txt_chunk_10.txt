It was informed at the bar that the correctness of judgement of Central Organisation of Railway Electrifications16 has been challenged and referred to a larger bench in Union of India v. M/s D Tantia Constructions Ltd17 as well as JWS Steel Ltd v. Southwestern Railways and Anr18. As we have noticed that the decision in Central Organisation of Railway Electrifications (supra) is not applicable in the present case, its reference to the larger Bench will have no bearing on the outcome of the present case.
