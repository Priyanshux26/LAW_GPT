The appellant is aggrieved by initiation of a criminal proceeding against him and his detention in connection with the same by the respondent State through its CID. Allegations have been made against him for commission of offences under Sections 166, 167, 418, 420, 465, 468, 471, 409, 209 and 109 read with Sections 120-B, 34 and 37 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 12 and 13(2) read with Sections 13(1)(c) and (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The said offences are alleged to have been committed between the years 2015 and 2019, during which period he was the Chief Minister of the State of Andhra Pradesh. Initially, a First Information Report dated 09.12.2021 was lodged with CID Police Station, Andhra Pradesh, Mangalagiri implicating twenty-six persons as accused. On that basis, CR No. 29/2021 was registered. The appellant was not included in the array of accused persons in that F.I.R. The offences primarily relate to siphoning of public funds and I shall refer broadly to the allegations forming the basis of the F.I.R. in the succeeding paragraphs of this . The list of accused persons was subsequently expanded and the appellant was also arraigned as an accused by an “Accused Adding Memo” [2024] 1 S.C.R. 555 Nara Chandrababu Naidu v. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr. dated 08.09.2021 lodged before the Special Judge, SPE & ACB cases (hereinafter referred to as “the Special Judge”). The appellant was implicated as accused no.37, whereas another individual, Kinjarapu Atchannaidu was made the 38th accused. The latter is a former minister of Andhra Pradesh and appears to be a member of the legislative assembly of that State at present.
