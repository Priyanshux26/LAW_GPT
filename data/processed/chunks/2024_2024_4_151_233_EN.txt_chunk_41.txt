This Court has, even in cases where the selected candidates were too large, unlike in the present case, held that even while adjudicating 210 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the writ petitions at least some of the selected candidates ought to be impleaded even it is in a representative capacity. It has also been held that in service jurisprudence, if an unsuccessful candidate challenges the selection process the selected candidates ought to be impleaded. [See J.S. Yadav vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another, (2011) 6 SCC 570 (para 31) and Prabodh Verma and Others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others, (1984) 4 SCC 251 (para 28) and Ranjan Kumar and Others vs. State of Bihar and Others, 2014:INSC:276 = (2014) 16 SCC 187 (paras 4,5,8,9 & 13)] This is not a case where the allegation was that the mischief was so widespread and all pervasive affecting the result of the selection in a manner as to make it difficult to sift the grain from the chaff. It could not be said and it is not even the case of the State that it was not possible to segregate the allegedly tainted candidates from the untainted candidates. [See Union of India and Others vs. G. Chakradhar, (2002) 5 SCC 146 (paras 7 & 8), Abhishek Kumar Singh vs. G. Pattanaik and Others, 2021:INSC:305 = (2021) 7 SCC 613 (para 72). 36. From time immemorial, the importance of the audi alteram partem rule has been emphasized and re-emphasized in several judicial pronouncements. Two of them are set out to highlight the underlying rationale. Chief Justice Sabyasachi Mukharji in Charan Lal Sahu vs. Union of India, (1990) 1 SCC 613 felicitously described its importance:- “124. … It is true that not giving notice, was not proper because principles of natural justice are fundamental in the constitutional set up of this country. No man or no man’s right should be affected without an opportunity to ventilate his views. We are also conscious that justice is a psychological yearning, in which men seek acceptance of their viewpoint by having an opportunity of vindication of their viewpoint before the forum or the authority enjoined or obliged to take a decision affecting their right….” [Emphasis supplied] The above passage very much echoes what Lord Megarry said in John vs. Rees and Others, [1969] 2 All E.R. 274 at 309 FG:- “It may be that there are some who would decry the importance which the courts attach to the observance of [2024] 4 S.C.R. 211 Krishnadatt Awasthy v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. the rules of natural justice. “When something is obvious,” they may say, “why force everybody to go through the tiresome waste of time involved in framing charges and giving an opportunity to be heard? The result is obvious from the start.” Those who take this view do not, I think, do themselves justice. As everybody who has anything to do with the law well knows, the path of the law is strewn with examples of open and shut cases which, somehow, were not; of unanswerable charges which, in the event, were completely answered; of inexplicable conduct which was fully explained; of fixed and unalterable determinations that, by discussion, suffered a change.
