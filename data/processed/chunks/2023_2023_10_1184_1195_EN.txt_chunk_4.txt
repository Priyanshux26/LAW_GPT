While weighing and considering an application (for grant of anticipatory bail) the court has to consider the nature of the offence, the role of E the person, the likelihood of his influencing the course of investigation, or tampering with evidence (including intimidating witnesses), likelihood of fleeing justice (such as leaving the country), etc. The courts would be justified — and ought to impose conditions spelt out in Section 437(3) F CrPC [by virtue of Section 438(2)]. The necessity to impose other restrictive conditions, would have to be weighed on a case-by-case basis, and depending upon the materials produced by the State or the investigating agency. Such special or other restrictive conditions may be imposed if the case or cases warrant, but should not be imposed in a routine manner, G in all cases. Likewise, conditions which limit the grant of anticipatory bail may be granted, if they are required in the facts of any case or cases; however, such limiting conditions may not be invariably imposed. ********************************* H 1190 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 85.4. Courts ought to be generally guided by the considerations such as nature and gravity of the offences, the role attributed to the applicant, and the facts of the case, while assessing whether to grant anticipatory bail, or refusing it. Whether to grant or not is a matter of discretion; equally whether, and if so, what kind of special conditions are to be B imposed (or not imposed) are dependent on facts of the case, and subject to the discretion of the court. 85.5. Anticipatory bail granted can, depending on the conduct and behaviour of the accused, continue after filing of the charge-sheet till end of trial. Also s of anticipatory bail C should not be “blanket” in the sense that it should not enable the accused to commit further offences and claim relief. It should be confined to the offence or incident, for which apprehension of arrest is sought, in relation to a specific incident. It cannot operate in respect of a future incident that D involves commission of an offence. ********************************* 87. The history of our Republic — and indeed, the Freedom Movement has shown how the likelihood of arbitrary arrest and indefinite detention and the lack of safeguards played E an important role in rallying the people to demand Independence. Witness the Rowlatt Act, the nationwide protests against it, the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre and several other incidents, where the general public were exercising their right to protest but were brutally suppressed and eventually jailed for long. The spectre of arbitrary and heavy-handed arrests F : too often, to harass and humiliate citizens, and oftentimes, at the interest of powerful individuals (and not to further any meaningful investigation into offences) led to the enactment of Section 438. Despite several Law Commission Reports and recommendations of several committees and commissions, G arbitrary and groundless arrests continue as a pervasive phenomenon. Parliament has not thought it appropriate to curtail the power or discretion of the courts, in granting pre- arrest or anticipatory bail, especially regarding the duration, or till charge-sheet is filed, or in serious crimes.
