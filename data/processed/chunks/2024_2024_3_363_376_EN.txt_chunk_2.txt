Facts: 5. The appellant-Board is a statutory and an autonomous body which manages certain temples in the southern part of India, including the Sabarimala Temple. One of the many functions of the appellant- Board, in so far as the Sabarimala Temple is concerned, is the preparation and distribution of the Aravana Prasadam. The appellant- Board is also tasked with procuring the raw material necessary for its preparation. One such raw material is cardamom. In to procure the same, the appellant-Board issues tenders in frequent intervals. Respondent no. 1 was the successful bidder in 2021 and it supplied 9000 kilograms of cardamom to the appellant-Board for the years 2021-2022. 6.

Since the first two tenders had failed to fetch an appropriate bid, the appellant-Board issued a third tender on 12.10.2022. However, as the festive season was fast-approaching, the appellant-Board was constrained to invoke the urgency clause and authorise the Executive Officer of Sabarimala Temple to procure cardamom from local sources. Accordingly, on 04.11.2022, since a decent number of cardamom traders were present in the temple premises, a notice inviting quotations along with samples was published on the notice board of the Sabarimala Temple. 8.
