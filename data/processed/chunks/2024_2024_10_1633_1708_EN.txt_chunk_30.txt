The Income Tax Act 1961 also mandates assessing officers to fulfil certain pre-conditions before issuing a notice of reassessment. Section 149 requires assessing officers to issue a notice of reassessment under Section 148 within the prescribed time limits. Further, Section 151 requires assessing officers to obtain sanction of the specified authority before issuing notice under Section 148. In Chhugamal Rajpal v. S P Chaliha, a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that Section 151 must be strictly adhered to because it contains “important safeguards.”65 32. A statutory authority may lack jurisdiction if it does not fulfil the preliminary conditions laid down under the statute, which are necessary to the exercise of its jurisdiction.66 There cannot be any waiver of a statutory requirement or provision that goes to the root of the jurisdiction of assessment.67 An passed without jurisdiction is a nullity. Any consequential passed or action taken will also be invalid and without jurisdiction.68 Thus, the power of assessing officers to reassess is limited and based on the fulfilment of certain preconditions.69 iii. Principles of strict interpretation and workability 33. The dominant purpose in interpreting a taxingstatute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature to impose a charge.70 A literal rule of construction requires the language of a statute to be construed according to its literal and grammatical meaning, whatever the result may be.71 In comparison, a strict interpretation of a statute does not encompass strict literalism, which leads to absurdity or goes against the express legislative intent.72 The principle of strict interpretation requires the courts to interpret and decipher the meaning of the words of the statute in their usual sense.73 65 [1971] 3 SCR 442 : (1971) 1 SCC 453 [5] 66 Chhotobhai Jethabhai Patel v.
