In fact, the dated 25.08.2022 passed in Review Petition (Crl.) No.219 of 2022 discloses that prima facie the B Court was of the view that at least two of the issues raised in the review petition require consideration. Though it is not precisely spelt out in the , those two issues relate to (i) not providing the accused with a copy of the ECIR; and (ii) reversal of the burden of proof and presumption of innocence. The points that the respondents are canvasing in this case, have nothing to do with those two issues. Therefore, the C accused cannot have a piggyback ride on the review petition. 117. In fact, as we have pointed out elsewhere, the accused have not come up with any appeal challenging the of the High Court dated 01.09.2022. Therefore, they are entitled at the maximum, to argue only for the dismissal of the appeals filed by ED and others against the D said decision. Suppose we agree with the learned counsel for the accused and dismiss the appeals filed by ED, even then they cannot have an escape route since the impugned of the High Court protects them only till the other proceedings are kept at bay. 118. Therefore, the accused is not entitled at all either to seek a E reference to a larger Bench or to seek to defer the matter till a decision is rendered in the matters involving larger issues. 119. In view of the above, the appeals arising out of the of the Division Bench of the High Court are liable to be allowed. Accordingly, these appeals are allowed and the of the Division Bench of the F Madras High Court dated 01.09.2022 is set aside. ED will now be entitled to proceed further from the stage at which their hands were tied by the impugned . PART-III (Permission to ED to inspect the records of the Special Court trying the predicate offences) G 120. To recapitulate, ED registered an Information Report on 29.07.2021. Thereafter, ED filed applications before the Special Court seeking certified copies of the FIR, statements of witnesses, etc. By an dated 09.11.2021, the Special Court allowed the application partly and directed the issue of certified copies of FIR, complaint, statements, etc., but refused to provide certified copies of unmarked documents. H 1094 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 121. As against the said , ED moved the High Court under Section 482 of the Code. These petitions were partly allowed by the High Court by an dated 30.03.2022, permitting ED to have inspection of the documents under Rule 237 of the Rules, 2019 and thereafter, to file a fresh third party copy application. It is against this that one of the accused by name M. Karthikeyan (Accused No.3) B in the Final Report filed under Section 173(8) of the Code in CC No.24 of 2021 has come up with an appeal. 122. The grievance of the appellant in this appeal is that the High Court has overlooked the provisions of Rule 231(3) of the Rules, 2019 and also Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 187235.
