Accordingly, Constitution (One Hundred and Second Amendment) Act, 2018, was brought about and Articles 338B & 342A were inserted constituting a separate commission for socially and educationally backward classes and empowering the President to specify socially and educationally backward classes. 15 (2014) 8 SCC 1 16 [2015] 5 SCR 670 : (2015) 4 SCC 697 1654 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 36. In Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil vs. State of Maharashtra,17 5 Judges Constitution Bench struck down the reservation for Marathas in the State of Maharashtra on the ground that the State does not have power to declare any class of people as socially and educationally backward classes. 37. In to overcome the difficulty created by the above decision, Constitution (One Hundred and Fifth Amendment) Act, 2021 was brought about amending Article 342A so as to provide that the list of socially and educationally backward classes of citizens prepared by the President is only for the Central Government but the State can also prepare its own list. 38. In between, Constitution (One Hundred and Third Amendment) Act, 2019, was enacted whereby Sub-Article (6) was inserted in Articles 15 and 16 in the following terms: “Article 15 (6)- Nothing in this article or sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of article 19 or clause (2) of article 29 shall prevent the State from making,— (a) any special provision for the advancement of any economically weaker sections of citizens other than the classes mentioned in clauses (4) and (5); and (b) any special provision for the advancement of any economically weaker sections of citizens other than the classes mentioned in clauses (4) and (5) in so far as such special provisions relate to their admission to educational institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of article 30, which in the case of reservation would be in addition to the existing reservations and subject to a maximum of ten per cent. of the total seats in each category.
