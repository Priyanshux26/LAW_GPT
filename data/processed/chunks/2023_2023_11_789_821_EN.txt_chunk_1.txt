[Para 63] Evidence – Dying declaration – Acceptability – Theory: Held: The juristic theory regarding the acceptability of a dying declaration is that such declaration is made in extremity, when the party is at the point of death and when every hope of this world is gone, when every motive to falsehood is silenced, and the man is induced by the most powerful consideration to speak only the truth – Notwithstanding the same, great caution must be exercised in considering the weight to be given to it on account of the existence of many circumstances which may aff ect their truth – The situation in which a man is on the deathbed is so solemn and serene, is the reason in law to accept the veracity of his statement – It is for this reason, the requirements of oath and cross-examination are dispensed with – Since, the accused has no power of cross-examination, the courts insist that the dying declaration should be of such a nature as to inspire full confi dence of the court in its truthfulness and correctness – However, the court should always be on guard to see that the statement of the deceased was not as a result of either tutoring or prompting or a product of imagination.

THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH 791 Evidence – Dying declaration – Reliance upon – Factors to be considered – Duty of the Court: Held: Despite a general consensus of presuming that the dying declaration is true, they have not been stricto-sensu accepted, rather the general course of action has been that judge decides whether the essentials of a dying declaration are met and if it can be admissible, once done, it is upon the duty of the court to see the extent to which the dying declaration is entitled to credit – Thus, there is no hard and fast rule for determining when a dying declaration should be accepted – Duty of the Court is to decide this question in the facts and surrounding circumstances of the case and be fully convinced of the truthfulness of the same – Factors to be considered, enumerated. [Paras 60 and 62] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Conduct: The conduct of the accused may be unnatural because he was residing in the very same house, however, the conduct which may be a relevant fact u/s.8, by itself may not be suffi cient to hold a person guilty of the off ence of murder – Penal Code, 1860 – s.302. [Para 46] Evidence – Dying declaration – Sanctity/presumption attached to – Justifi cation for: The justifi cation for the sanctity/presumption attached to a dying declaration is two fold- (i) ethically and religiously it is presumed that a person while at the brink of death will not lie, whereas (ii) from a public policy perspective it is to tackle a situation where the only witness to the crime is not available. [Para 64] Evidence – Dying declaration – Suspicion as regards correctness of – Duty of Court: It is unsafe to record the conviction on the basis of a dying declaration alone in the cases where suspicion, like the case on hand is raised, as regards the correctness of the dying declaration – In such cases, the Court may have to look for some corroborative evidence by treating the dying declaration only as a piece of evidence – The evidence and material available on record must be properly weighed in each case to arrive at an appropriate conclusion.
