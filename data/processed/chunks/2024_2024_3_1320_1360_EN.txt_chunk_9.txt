At the 18th Conference of the Parties in Doha, Qatar in December 201211, States reaffirmed their commitment to addressing climate change and laid the groundwork for greater ambition and action. Among various decisions, they set a timetable to adopt a Universal Climate Agreement by 2015. The objective was to build consensus on a binding and universal agreement which would limit greenhouse gas emissions to levels that would prevent global temperatures from increasing more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees F) above the temperature benchmark set before the Industrial revolution. The COP 21 meeting was convened in Paris in December 2015, where 196 countries, including India signed a new Climate Change Agreement on 12 December 2015.12 This is termed as the Paris Agreement.13 15. In the build-up to the Paris meeting, the UN had called upon parties to submit their plans on how they intended to reduce their greenhouse emissions. India submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC on October 2, 2015. The Paris Agreement mandates that each Party communicate a nationally determined contribution every five years. India communicated an update to its first NDC submitted earlier on 2 October 2015, for the period up to 2030. India’s commitment under the Paris Agreement includes the following key features14: a. To achieve approximately 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 8 Ibid, art 2. 9 Ibid, art 3(1). 10 Ibid, art 3(3). 11 “The Doha Climate Gateway” 12 Conference of the Parties, Adoption of the Paris Agreement (Adopted 12 December 2015).

To enhance investments in development programs in sectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water resources, the Himalayan region, coastal areas, health, and disaster management, to better adapt to climate change impacts; and c. To establish domestic frameworks and international architectures for the rapid dissemination of cutting-edge climate technology in India and to engage in joint collaborative research and development for future climate technologies. As part of its pledge, India has committed to transitioning to non- fossil fuel sources and reducing emissions. 16. One of the key strategies in India’s efforts towards sustainability is the ambitious target for renewable energy capacity installation. By 2022, India aimed to achieve an installed renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) of 175 GW (Gigawatts), a goal that signifies the country’s commitment to clean energy adoption. Looking ahead, India has set an even more ambitious target for 2030, aiming to ramp up its installed renewable energy capacity to 450 GW. This long-term goal underscores India’s recognition of the urgent need to accelerate the transition towards renewable energy to mitigate the impacts of climate change and achieve sustainable development. 17. To achieve these targets, India has implemented various policy measures and initiatives to promote renewable energy investment, innovation, and adoption.
