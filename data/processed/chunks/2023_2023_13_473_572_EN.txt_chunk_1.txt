1 of 2006 (Grievances Redressal Mechanism: To Redress Grievances of Women/ Sexual Harassment at Work Place) – Clause 10(viii) – Sexual harassment at workplace – Lady employee lodged complaint – Disciplinary proceedings conducted under Rule 14 of the 1965 CCS Rules – Central Complaint Committee constituted by the Competent authority to make inquiry had put questions to the witnesses in a departmental inquiry – Whether the same vitiated the inquiry proceedings – Service Law – Central Civil Services (Classifi cation, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965 – r.14 – Disciplinary proceedings – “Fact Finding” Authority. Held: It is the Inquiry Authority and the Disciplinary Authority who are the fact fi nding authorities in a disciplinary proceeding – A perusal of r.14 of the 1965 CCS Rules makes it clear that, where a ‘Presenting Offi cer’ has been appointed by the Disciplinary Authority, such Offi cer shall present the case in support of the articles of charge. Conversely, what logically transpires from the aforesaid is that, where no presenting offi cer has been appointed, the duty or role to present the case in support of the articles of charge falls back on the Disciplinary Authority or the Inquiry Authority as the case may be – The power and discretion of the complaints committee to put question to the witnesses is further refl ected though implicitly in Clause 10(viii) of the 2006 Standing – There appears to be neither any statutory bar nor any logic to restrict the power of the complaints committee to put questions to the witnesses only to the context enumerated in the aforesaid provision – One fails to understand what other purpose the complaints committee which is deemed to be an ‘inquiry authority’ would serve, if it is held that the complaints committee cannot put questions to the witnesses – If s.165 of the Evidence Act, 1872 permits a Judge to put questions to the parties or to the witnesses in to discover or obtain proper proof of relevant facts and this provision being widely used by the judges throughout the country, how the complaints committee after being equated with a judge 476 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. in a judicial proceeding can be denied that privilege – High Court was not correct in taking the view that the proceedings stood vitiated because the Central Complaints Committee put questions to the prosecution witnesses. [Paras 69,73,75, 77 and 78] Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 – Whether the Central Complaints Committee based its fi ndings on conjectures and surmises – Whether the instant case is one of “no evidence”. Held: The evidence taken into consideration by the Central Complaints Committee for arriving at the conclusion that the charges were held to be proved would indicate that this was not a case of “no evidence” – Some evidence has come on record to indicate or rather substantiate the allegations of sexual harassment levelled by the complainant – The allegation related to the respondent making unsolicited phone calls to the complainant, although no evidence of the call recordings had been produced to substantiate the same, was rightly accepted by the Central Complaints Committee keeping in mind the background of the case – The fi ndings of the Central Complaints Committee could not be said to be based on conjectures and surmises – The Central Complaints Committed duly noted that the non-availability of the call records was owed to the fact that the inquiry into the complainant’s grievances was undertaken after a lapse of signifi cant time – Moreover, said fi nding is fortifi ed by the oral evidence of one of the witnesses who deposed that he was aware of the respondent making calls to the complainant.
