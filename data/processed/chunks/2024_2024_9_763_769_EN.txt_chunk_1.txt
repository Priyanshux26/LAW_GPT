Tiwari, Gurmeet Singh Makker, Advs. for the Respondents. / of the Supreme Court Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. The short question before us is whether the appellant is entitled to post award interest on the sum awarded by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator [2024] 9 S.C.R. 765 R.P. Garg v. The Chief General Manager, Telecom Department & Ors. denied payment of such interest under a misplaced impression that the contract between the parties prohibited it. The executing Court1 affirmed the finding of the Arbitrator and rejected the prayer. However, allowing the appeal, the District Court2 held that the appellant will be entitled to post award interest. By the impugned before us, the High Court3 allowed the revision and set aside the District Court while holding that the contract between the parties did not permit grant of post award interest. 2.1 For the reasons to follow, while allowing the appeal we have held that as this is a case arising out of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,4 by operation of Section 31(7)(b), the sum directed to be paid under the Arbitral Award shall carry interest. This is a first principle. A sum directed to be paid by an Arbitral Award must carry interest. In this view of the matter, we have restored the of the District Court granting 18% interest from the date of the award to its realization. The short facts are as under: 3.
