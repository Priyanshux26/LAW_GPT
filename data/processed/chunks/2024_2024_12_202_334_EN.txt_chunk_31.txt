(ii) If the answer to the aforesaid question is in the affirmative, then whether the exposition of law propounded by this Court in Canon India (supra) as regards the power of the DRI to issue show cause notices could be said to be the correct statement of law? This would entail addressal of the following questions: a. Whether officers of DRI are the proper officers for the purposes of Section 28 of the Act, 1962? b. What would be the extent, scope and domain of Section 6 of the Act, 1962 vis-à-vis Section 2(34), Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5 of the Act, 1962 and whether an entrustment by the Central Government under Section 6 of the Act, 1962 is mandatory to empower the Officers of the DRI for the purpose of issuing show cause notices? c. Whether the power under Section 28 can be exercised only by someone who is empowered to exercise the power [2024] 12 S.C.R. 251 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. under Section 17 of the Act, 1962 for the goods in question? In other words, how best the meaning of the expression “proper officer” should be construed for the purposes of exercise of functions under Section 28? d. Whether “the proper officer” in Section 28 must necessarily be the same proper officer referred to under Section 17 of the Act, 1962? If no, whether the use of the definite article “the” in the expression “the proper officer” in Section 28 is in the context of that proper officer who has been assigned the powers of discharging the functions under Section 28 by virtue of powers conferred under Section 5 of the Act, 1962? e. Whether issuance of show cause notices followed by adjudication under Section 28 of the Act, 1962 is an administrative review as held in Canon India (supra) or a quasi-judicial exercise of power under administrative law? (iii) Whether the introduction of Section 28(11) vide the Validation Act of 2011 which retrospectively validates the show cause notices issued under Section 28 with effect from 06.07.2011, is discriminatory and arbitrary for not curing the defect highlighted in Sayed Ali (supra) and, therefore, is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India? (iv) Whether the delivered by the High Court of Delhi in the case of Mangali Impex (supra) expounds the correct interpretation of Section 28(11)? (v) Whether Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022, which retrospectively validates the show cause notices with effect from 01.04.2023, is manifestly arbitrary and therefore, violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India?
