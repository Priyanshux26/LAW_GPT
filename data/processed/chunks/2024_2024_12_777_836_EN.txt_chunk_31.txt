This principle was explained in some more detail in Raghunath Anant Govilkar v. State of Maharashtra [(2008) 11 SCC 289 : (2009) 1 SCC (Cri) 130] , which was decided by this Court on 8-2-2008 in SLP (Crl.) No. 5453 of 2007, in the following manner : (SCC pp. 298-99, para 11) “11. ‘7. … “66. … On the question of the applicability of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the principle laid down in two cases, namely, Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. State of Bombay [AIR 1955 SC 287 : 1955 Cri LJ 857] and Amrik Singh v. State of Pepsu [AIR 1955 SC 309 : 1955 Cri LJ 865] was as follows : (Amrik Singh case [AIR 1955 SC 309 : 1955 Cri LJ 865], AIR p. 312, para 8) ‘8. … It is not every offence committed by a public servant that requires sanction for prosecution under Section 197(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code; nor even every act done by him while he is actually engaged in the performance of his official duties; but if the act complained of is directly concerned with his official duties so that, if questioned, it could be claimed to have been done by virtue of the office, then sanction would be necessary….’ The real question therefore, is whether the acts complained of in the present case were directly concerned with the official duties of the three public servants. As far as the offence of criminal conspiracy punishable under Section 120-B read with Section 409 818 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of the Penal Code is concerned and also Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, are concerned they cannot be said to be of the nature mentioned in Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. To put it shortly, it is no part of the duty of a public servant, while discharging his official duties, to enter into a criminal conspiracy or to indulge in criminal misconduct. Want of sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is, therefore, no bar.” [Ed. : As observed in Harihar Prasad v. State of Bihar (1972) 3 SCC 89, 115, para 66 : 1972 SCC (Cri) 409.] ‹ [Ed. : Quoted from State of Kerala v. V. Padmanabhan Nair (1999) 5 SCC 690, 692, para 7 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 1031.] ” 17. Likewise, in Shambhoo Nath Misra v. State of U.P. [(1997) 5 SCC 326 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 676 : AIR 1997 SC 2102], the Court dealt with the subject in the following manner : (SCC p. 328, para 5) “5. The question is when the public servant is alleged to have committed the offence of fabrication of record or misappropriation of public fund, etc. can he be said to have acted in discharge of his official duties? It is not the official duty of the public servant to fabricate the false record and misappropriate the public funds, etc. in furtherance of or in the discharge of his official duties.
