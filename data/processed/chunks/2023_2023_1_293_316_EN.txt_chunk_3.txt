THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA The of the Court was delivered by A ABHAY S. OKA, J. FACTUAL ASPECTS 1. In Writ Petition (C) No.740 of 1986, the preliminary issue is whether the view taken by a Constitution Bench of this Court in the B case of Sardar Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb v. State of Bombay1, requires reconsideration. 2. In the case of Sardar Syedna1, the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India was invoked for challenging the constitutional validity of the Bombay Protection of Ex-communication C Act, 1949 (for short, ‘the Ex- communication Act’). Section 3 of the Ex-communication Act provided that notwithstanding anything contained in any law, custom or usage for the time being in force to the contrary, no ex- communication of a member of any community shall be valid and shall be of any effect. Under the Ex-communication Act, the term ‘community’ was defined to mean a group, the members of which are D connected together by reason of the fact that by birth, conversion or the performance of any religious rite, they belong to the same religion or religious creed and includes caste or sub- caste. Under clause (b) of Section 2 of the Ex-communication Act, ‘ex-communication’ was defined as the expulsion of a person from any community of which he is a member E depriving him of rights and privileges which are legally enforceable by a suit of civil nature by him or on his behalf as such member.
