[2023] 12 S.C.R. 55 : 2023 INSC 803 CASE DETAILS R. SREENIVASA v. STATE OF KARNATAKA (Criminal Appeal No. 859 of 2011) SEPTEMBER 06, 2023 [VIKRAM NATH AND AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: High Court if justifi ed in reversing the acquittal passed by the Trial Court qua the appellant-accused acquitting him of off ences u/ss.302 and 201, IPC by which it held that the prosecution had failed to prove that the deceased was last seen in the company of the appellant. Evidence – Circumstantial evidence – Last seen theory – When cannot be invoked: Held: The ‘last seen’ theory can be invoked only when the same stands proved beyond reasonable doubt – In the present case, there is no defi nitive evidence of last seen and that theory itself is in doubt – Also, there is a long time-gap between the alleged last seen and the recovery of the body – Further, there is major discrepancy in the charge framed and the statement of the witnesses- the specifi c allegation that co-accused was the one who had taken away the deceased from his house, whereas during deposition the deceased’s wife and his brother stated that it was the appellant who had taken away the deceased is enough to raise doubts with regard to the veracity and authenticity of such statements – Also, the fact that the deceased, late at night, agreed to go to the house of the appellant, when seen in the backdrop of the allegation that there was strong animosity between the two, appears to be highly improbable – Further, it does not appear that the deceased’s family took any steps to fi nd out as to where the deceased had gone despite being missing for more than two days – The deceased’s wife even testifi ed that relations between the parties were cordial, and did not hint at animosity – Thus, in the absence of other corroborative pieces 55 56 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. of evidence, it cannot be said that the chain of circumstances is so complete that the only inference that could be drawn is the guilt of the appellant – Unsafe to sustain the conviction of the appellant on such evidence, where the chain is incomplete – Presumption of innocence is in favour of the accused and when doubts emanate, the benefi t accrues to the accused, and not the prosecution – Impugned set aside. [Paras 13, 15, 16 and 17] Practice and Procedure – Acquittal – Interference by appellate Court: Held: An appellate court, in the case of an acquittal, must bear in mind that there is a double presumption in favour of the accused – When two views are possible, the one favouring the accused is to be leaned on – Criminal Law.
