(1977) 2 SCC 699 Paragraph 10]. Applying these principles to the present case, we accept the submission of the learned ASG that the appellants have not made out the case to say that the charge is groundless. 44. The other argument about the minority of the appellant Puneet Sabharwal also need not detain the Court since for the last seven years of the check period admittedly he was not a minor. All the defences are available for the appellants to be placed before the Trial Court. 45. In view of what we have held hereinabove, we are not called upon to answer the argument raised by the learned ASG that the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal being a document which has emerged subsequent to the framing of the charge, it cannot be taken into consideration at all. 46. For all the above reasons, we find no merit in these appeals and the appeals are dismissed. The interim s stand vacated. All pending applications stand closed. The trial has been pending for 704 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports nearly 25 years. We direct that the trial be expeditiously concluded and, in any case, on or before 31.12.2024. Needless to mention that the observations made herein are only in the context of the discharge proceedings. Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan Result of the case: Appeals dismissed.
