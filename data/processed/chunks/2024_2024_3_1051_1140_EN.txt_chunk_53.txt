1129 Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. in miscalculating the distance between Banas siding of the appellant-Company and place of delivery at Thiyat Hamira Railway station by wrongly measuring the distance as 946 KMs as against the actual distance of 511 KMs between the two stations. Counsel submitted that no sooner the letter dated 30.12.1987 was received by the appellant-Company requisite notice were issued to the respondent-Railway on 17.02.1988.[...] xxx xxx xxx [...] In fact the appellant-company itself averred of realisation of an excess freight and specifically in para 6 of the plaint had itself averred that due to “mistake” in calculating of distance, excess freight was realised at the rate of Rs.21.44 per qtl. instead of Rs.13.11 per qtl.. Further in the notice under Section 78B of the Act of 1890 R/w Section 80 CPC issued by the appellant- Company prior to the filing of the suit for recovery of money before the District Judge, Sirohi, it was submitted that due to mistake on the part of the booking staff of the Railways incorrect distance was computed from Banas siding to Thiyat Hamira railway station against the correct chargeable distance of 511 KMs and the distance was worked out to 946 KMs. which was the chargeable via Rewari. In para 4 of the suit it was stated that on the part of the Railway enhanced rate (emphasis mine) @ Rs.21.44 per qtl. was charged. In my considered opinion as also held by the learned Tribunal, the case set up by the appellant-Company makes it evidently clear that the refund was sought of the excess freight realizedallegedly illegally and unauthorizedly. The excess freight without doubt related to freight otherwise payable for the movement / transportation of goods by the Railways and therefore was obviously an 1130 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports overcharge. Consequently, Section 78B of the Act of 1890 attracted to the claim petition filed. Admittedly notice with regard to the freight paid between 07.12.1985 and 11.02.1986 was issued on 17.02.1988 quite clearly beyond the period of six months as statutorily mandated. The Tribunal was right in so holding.” (Emphasis supplied) 106.2 Similarly in Mineral Enterprises (supra), the wrong chargeable distance was in respect to the railway receipts which were issued that showed 365 km instead of 359 km. It was not a case of the notified rates being wrong i.e., the charge that has been made payable under law. This is further evinced by the fact that the High Court itself observed that the excess freight was charged than the “prescribed distance”. Thus, it appears that the mistake related to one in the “calculation of the distance” at the time of booking and doesn’t appear to be a mistake in the “prescribed distance”. Similarly, even in the said decision, it is nowhere mentioned that, 365 km was a “notified chargeable distance”, thus, even this decision does not come in aid of the appellants herein. “14. It is an admitted fact that the respondent Company had transported the iron ore fines/ minerals through the railways for the period from 25.05.2006 to 04.01.2007 at the rates fixed by the railways.
