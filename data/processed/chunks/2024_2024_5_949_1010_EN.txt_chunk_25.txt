Puttaswamy.34 The majority was of the following view: “2. The present review petitions have been filed against the final and dated 26-9-2018. We have perused the review petitions as well as the grounds in support thereof. In our opinion, no case for review of and dated 26-9-2018 is made out. We hasten to add that change in the law or subsequent decision/ of a coordinate or larger Bench by itself cannot be regarded as a ground for review. The review petitions are accordingly dismissed.” J. OTHER PRECEDENTS ON REVIEW 55. Precedents on the aspect of review are legion and we do not wish to burden this by tracing all the decisions. However, only a few that were considered in the split verdict, some which were cited by the parties before us and some that have emerged on our research on the subject and considered relevant, are discussed/ referred to here. 33 [2014] 1 SCR 308 : (2014) 5 SCC 75 34 [2021] 1 SCR 681 : (2021) 3 SCC 1 984 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 56. Two of these decisions, viz. A.C. Estates v. Serajuddin 35 and Raja Shatrunji v. Mohd. Azmat Azim Khan 36 were rendered prior to introduction of the Explanation in Rule 1 of XLVII, CPC. Significantly, even without the Explanation, substantially the same view was expressed. 57. In A.C. Estates (supra), a bench of three Hon’ble Judges of this Court, while dismissing the civil appeal and upholding the of the High Court at Calcutta, held as follows: “Our attention in this connection is drawn to Section 29(5) of the Act which gives power to the Controller to review his s and the conditions laid down under 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure. But this cannot be a case of review on the ground of discovery of new and important matter, for such matter has to be something which exist at the date of the and there can be no review of an which was right when made on the ground of the happening of some subsequent event (see Rajah Kotagiri Venkata Subbamma Rao v. Raja Vellanki Venkatrama Rao 37). (emphasis supplied) 58. The next is the decision of a Bench of two Hon’ble Judges of this Court in Raja Shatrunji (supra). While dismissing an appeal and upholding the of the Allahabad High Court, reference was made to “any other sufficient reason” in Rule 1 of XLVII, CPC and the decision in Rajah Kotagiri Venkata Subbamma Rao (supra) whereupon it was held: “13. *** the principles of review are defined by the Code and the words ‘any other sufficient reason’ in 47 of the Code would mean a reason sufficient on grounds analogous to those specified immediately previously in that . The grounds for review are the discovery of new matters or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be 35 [1966] 1 SCR 235 36 [1971] Supp. 1 SCR 433 : (1971) 2 SCC 200 37 LR (1899-1900) 27 IA 197 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
