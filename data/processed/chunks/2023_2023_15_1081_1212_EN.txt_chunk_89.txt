Reliance was placed on Javer Chand (supra). 22. Avinash Kumar Chauhanv. Vijay Krishna Mishra14 expounds the meaning of the words ‘for any purpose’ used in Section 35 of the Stamp Act. These words are to be given natural meaning and eff ect. They would include collateral purpose, as was held in the decision of the Privy Council in Ram Rattanv. Parma Nand15. Distinction was drawn between non-eff ect of registration of a document in terms of Section 49 of the Registration Act, 1908, which does not bar use of an unregistered document for a collateral purpose. Section 35 is diff erently worded, and when applicable, bars use of insuffi ciently stamped instrument for a collateral purpose. 12 (2007) 8 SCC 514. 13 (2006) 11 SCC 331. 14 (2009) 2 SCC 532. 15 AIR 1946 PC 51. 120 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 23. It is necessary to affi rm this legal position, as we enter into contracts or agreements several times in our interactions with others during the course of the day. Even written documents in the form of invoices, receipts or standard format agreements are often exchanged, and form the terms of the interactions. An unstamped or under-stamped contract or agreement cannot be impounded, except when it is produced for being received in evidence before a person authorised to do so or a public offi cer in terms of Section 33 of the Stamp Act. To hold that insuffi ciently stamped instrument does not exist in law, will cause disarray and disruption. 24. Predictability and certainty are central tenets of law, especially in matters of commercial and routine nature. Adherence to the principle of stare decisis is essential for parties to be able to rely on the law to defi ne their conduct in commercial or ordinary day to day dealings. Transient laws undermine public legitimacy and faith in the mandate of Rule of Law. This Court has previously observed that before reviewing and revising its earlier decision, the Court must satisfy itself whether it is necessary to do so in the interest of public good or for any other compelling reason, and the Court must endeavour to maintain certainty and continuity in the interpretation of the law in the country.16 On several occasions, this Court has emphasised on certainty and consistency in judicial pronouncements as being the cornerstone of the administration of justice.17 Consistency in judicial decisions is conducive to reassuring parties of the consequences of the transactions forming part of their daily aff airs.18 25. An instrument is to be stamped as per Section 33 when it is executed or fi rst executed. The expressions ‘executed’ and ‘execution’ have been defi ned in clause (12) to Section 2 of the Stamp Act to mean ‘signed’ or ‘signature’.19 It includes attribution of electronic record within the meaning 16 Keshav Mills Co.
