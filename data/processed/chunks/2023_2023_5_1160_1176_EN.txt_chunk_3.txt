The application was received B by the Registry of NCLT on 5 September 2022. On 15 September 2022, the was uploaded on the website of the NCLT and a certified copy was provided to the appellant on the same day. The appellant lodged an appeal before the NCLAT on 10 October 2022 in the e-filing mode along with an Interlocutory Application4 seeking condonation of delay of C five days. A physical copy of the appeal was filed on 31 October 2022. 4. The appellant submitted that the appeal had been filed within the period of limitation from the date the was made available in the public domain i.e., 15 September 2022. However, as a matter of abundant precaution, the appellant had considered 26 August 2022 to be the date D from which limitation would commence. The appellant stated that the prescribed time period of 30 days for filing the appeal ended on 5 October 2022, after accounting for the exclusion of 10 days (from 5 September 2022 to 15 September 2022 on account of the time taken to provide a certified copy). The appellant submitted that the inadvertent delay of 5 days in filing the appeal had been caused due to the additional time E needed to obtain legal advice, collate documents and connect with counsel during the festive season. 5. In the background of the above sequence of events, the issue before NCLAT was whether the appeal was instituted within limitation. In its impugned , NCLAT observed that the appeal was lodged F through the e-portal on 10 October 2022, which was the 46th day after the of the NCLT. It observed that while Section 61(2) of the IBC prescribes a 30-day deadline for preferring an appeal against an of the adjudicating authority, the appellate tribunal can condone a delay of upto 15 days, if sufficient cause is shown. Furthermore, it held that G the ingredients of Section 61 of the IBC do not visualize that an aggrieved person has to wait till he is in receipt of a certified copy of the impugned before preferring an appeal. The tribunal held: “31.It cannot be gainsaid, that the `Expiry of 30 days’, after the `Pronouncement of the impugned ’, dated H 4 “IA” SANKET KUMAR AGARWAL & ANR v. APG LOGISTICS PVT. 1165 LTD. [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 26.08.2022, was on 24.09.2022. The 30 days period in A preferring the `Appeal’, by any `Person Aggrieved’, in respect of an `’, passed by the `Adjudicating Authority’, is the `deadline’ prescribed as per Section 61 (2) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. If an `Appellate Tribunal’ (`NCLA T’), is satisfied on `sufficient cause’, being shown to its `subjective satisfaction’, in B regard to the preferring of an `Appeal’ (after the `Expiry of 30 days period’), then, `such period, shall not exceed 15 days’, as per Section 61 (2) of the Code. Admittedly, the `completion of 45 days’ (30 + 15 days), was on 09.10.2022. In effect, the maximum 45 days being the outer limit (30 + 15 = 45 days), beyond which, the `Appellate Tribunal’ (`NCLAT), is `bereft’ C of any power, to `condone the delay’, in the teeth of the mandate, prescribed under the I & B Code, 2016, as opined by this `Tribunal’.” (emphasis supplied) D 6.
