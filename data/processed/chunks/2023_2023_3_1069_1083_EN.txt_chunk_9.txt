s attaining finality and C certainty of the rights of the parties accrued in the light of the s passed must have sanctity. Exercise of suo motu power ‘at any time’ only means that no specific period such as days, months or years are not (sic) prescribed reckoning from a particular date. But that does not mean that ‘at any D time’ should be unguided and arbitrary. In this view, ‘at any time’ must be understood as within a reasonable time depending on the facts and circumstances of each case in the absence of prescribed period of limitation.” The above was followed in State of Andhra E Pradesh v. T. Yadagiri Reddy10 and Sulochana Chandrakant Galande v. Pune Municipal Transport11. 23. In view of the above, it is held that the argument of the society (i.e., appellant in C.A. No. 5328-29/2016) is merited. The s of the courts in its favour, clearly reveal that the 1.4 hectares owned by it, F for which conversion (from agricultural to non-agricultural use) was sanctioned, was sought to be cancelled, on the ground that the land, fell within the submergence area. The history of the previous litigation – which the NGT was seized with – reveals that the land forming part of Khasra No. 1248, owned by the society, was directly in issue in a litigation to which the state was a party, and in which it lost. That decree was G affirmed by all the courts. When the NGT was made aware of this fact, it chose to ignore it. Without a review, or any known process by which a decree concerning the same facts could be re-opened, the NGT could 10 (2008) 16 SCC 299: [2008] 16 SCR 792 11 (2010) 8 SCC 467: [2010] 9 SCR 476 H 1082 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A not have rejected the society’s contentions. The society’s appeal, therefore, requires to succeed. 24. As regards to the other appeals, this court notes that the NGT did not advert to any facts, such as the existence of the Development/ Master Plan, or the green area, and the road, after which the plots were B sought to be developed, although these were expressly brought to its notice, in the review proceedings. Furthermore, this court has also been appraised of the fact that the inquiry by the revenue authorities, after the second was made, has now resulted in awareness on the part of the Collector, and the Parishad, that the map on which the NGT based its main , was only a proposal and not a final map. Moreover, a C fresh litigation (O.A. No. 70/2022) is also pending. In these circumstances, it would be appropriate that the other appeals too are allowed, and the NGT considers the issue, afresh in O.A. No. 70/2022, and ensures that the precise boundaries of the talab are ascertained by a properly constituted committee. D 25. In view of the above, the following directions are issued: (a) C.A. No. 5328-29/2016 is allowed.
