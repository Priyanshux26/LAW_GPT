[Paras 29,52,53,56,61 and 62] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Applicability – Meaning of word “especially”: Held: s.106 of the Evidence Act provides that when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him – The word “especially” means facts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally within the knowledge of the accused – The ordinary rule that applies to the criminal trials that the onus lies on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused is not in any way modifi ed by the rule of facts embodied in s.106 of the Evidence Act – s.106 of the Evidence Act is an exception to s.101 of the Evidence Act. [Para 34] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 does not absolve the prosecution from duty of proving crime: BALVIR SINGH v. STATE OF UTTARAKHAND 817 Held: Section 106 cannot be invoked to make up the inability of the prosecution to produce evidence of circumstances pointing to the guilt of the accused – This section cannot be used to support a conviction unless the prosecution has discharged the onus by proving all the elements necessary to establish the off ence – It does not absolve the prosecution from the duty of proving that a crime was committed even though it is a matter specifi cally within the knowledge of the accused and it does not throw the burden of the accused to show that no crime was committed. [Para 42] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Distinction exists between the burden of proof and the burden of going forward with the evidence: Held: Generally, the burden of proof upon any affi rmative proposition necessary to be established as the foundation of an issue does not shift, but the burden of evidence or the burden of explanation may shift from one side to the other according to the testimony – Thus, if the prosecution has off ered evidence which if believed by the court would convince them of the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused is in a position where he should go forward with counter-vailing evidence if he has such evidence – When facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, the burden is on him to present evidence of such facts, whether the proposition is an affi rmative or negative one – He is not required to do so even though a prima facie case has been established, for the court must still fi nd that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt before it can convict – However, the accused's failure to present evidence on his behalf may be regarded by the court as confi rming the conclusion indicated by the evidence presented by the prosecution or as confi rming presumptions which might have been rebutted. [Para 46] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – “Prima facie” in context of s.106: Held: Section 106 of the Evidence Act would apply to cases where the prosecution could be said to have succeeded in proving facts from which a reasonable inference can be drawn regarding death.
