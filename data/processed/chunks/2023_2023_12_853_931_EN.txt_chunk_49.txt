Commissioner of Central Excise, Bangalore v. Srikumar Agencies & Ors., (2009) 1 SCC 469: “5. “15. …Courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fi ts in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. Observations of courts are neither to be read as Euclid’s theorems nor as provisions of the statute and that too taken out of their context. These observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated. s of courts are not to be 922 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. construed as statutes. To interpret words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may become necessary for Judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to defi ne. Judges interpret statutes, they do not interpret s. They interpret words of statutes; their words are not to be interpreted as statutes. In London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton [1951 AC 737 : (1951) 2 All ER 1 (HL)] (AC at p. 761) Lord Macdermott observed : (All ER p. 14 C-D) ‘… The matter cannot, of course, be settled merely by treating the ipsissima verba of Willes, J., as though they were part of an Act of Parliament and applying the rules of interpretation appropriate thereto. This is not to detract from the great weight to be given to the language actually used by that most distinguished Judge ….’ 16. In Home Offi ce v. Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd.

It will require qualifi cation in new circumstances.’ Megarry, J. in Shebherd Homes Ltd. v. Sandham (No. 2) [(1971) 1 WLR 1062 : (1971) 2 All ER 1267] observed : (All ER p. 1274d-e) ‘… One must not, of course, construe even a reserved of Russell, L.J. as if it were an Act of Parliament ….’ And, in British Railways Board v. Herrington [1972 AC 877 : (1972) 2 WLR 537 : (1972) 1 All ER 749 (HL)] Lord Morris said : (All ER p. 761c) ‘There is always peril in treating the words of a speech or as though they are words in a legislative enactment, and it is to be remembered that judicial utterances made in the setting of the facts of a particular case.’ 17. Circumstantial fl exibility, one additional or diff erent fact may make a world of diff erence between conclusions in two cases. Disposal of cases by blindly placing reliance on a decision is not proper. V. SENTHIL BALAJI v. THE STATE REPRESENTED BY 923 DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND ORS. [M. M. SUNDRESH, J.] 18.
