KISHORE 17 [VIKRAM NATH, J.] prospective applicability of a decision is not provided in the said decision, then it is presumed that it will have retrospective eff ect and declaration of any law as invalid would be unenforceable and non-existent from the statute book from the time of its inception. The in the case of Subramanian Swamy (supra) would, therefore, operate retrospectively and at least would be unenforceable ab initio. 10.13. The next submission is that the in the case of Transmission Corporation of A.P. Vs. C.H. Prabhakar and Others24 would also not be of any help to the respondent as under the American position of protection against ‘ex post facto’ laws, removal of a provision similar to Section 6A of the DSPE Act would not be hit.

Shri S.V. Raju, learned Additional Solicitor General of India made submissions on behalf of the Union of India. His submissions are briefl y summarized as follows: 11.1. Merely because the Court takes time to decide the matter or merely because the challenge to statutory provisions is made subsequently, it would not make an unconstitutional statutory provision legal or constitutional even if such provision has operated for some time till it is struck down by the Court. Such a violation is void ab initio, as settled by a large number of decisions of this Court. It is only rarely that in some cases in to obviate the hardships and on equitable grounds, this Court had protected an action taken under an unconstitutional statute. However, that does not mean that the statute was not unconstitutional or bad during the period it was on the statute book. 11.2. Prohibition under Section 6A of the DSPE Act is against conducting any enquiry or investigation. Referring to the defi nition of “enquiry” in Section 2(g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 197334, it was submitted that the enquiry commences after charge-sheet is fi led and is a forerunner to the trial. Reliance was placed upon the case of Hardeep Singh Vs. State of Punjab35, in particular, reference has been made to paragraphs 27, 29 and 39 of the report. 11.3. Further referring to the defi nition of the word “investigation” in Section 2(h) of Cr.P.C., it was submitted that the prohibition contained in Section 6A of the DSPE Act relates to the prohibition from collecting evidence in an enquiry or during the investigation.
