Moreover, his advocate was conversant with the English language. 22. Hence, in the facts of the cases in hand, it cannot be said that a non-supply of translation of the charge sheet and other documents to the accused in both appeals will occasion a failure of justice. 23.

The Trial Court shall expeditiously proceed with the trial. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals allowed. Divya Pandey
