(C) No.21 of 2009 was filed by the petitioner before the High Court of Sikkim at Gangtok, challenging the constitutionality of the letter dated 07.07.2009 as well as the Explanation to Section [2024] 8 S.C.R. 835 K. Arumugam v. Union of India & Others Etc. 65(19)(ii) inserted by the Finance Act, 2008. Vide impugned dated 03.07.2010, the High Court of Sikkim dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant herein. 3.5 The appellant maintained that the sale of lottery tickets is, in fact, an outright purchase and does not involve any service to the State in terms of promotion or marketing under the Explanation to Section 65(19)(ii) of the Finance Act, 1994 as amended by the Finance Act, 2008. The tickets sold were mainly for lotteries organized by the States of Kerala and Sikkim as well as the Government of Bhutan. 3.6 The Union of India, on the other hand, argued that the appellants, in addition to selling the tickets, provided a service to the State by marketing and promoting lotteries, as evidenced by the Agreement, including modifications and additions thereto, between the appellant and the State of Sikkim dated 24.08.2001, 09.12.2003, and 18.11.2005. It was contended that the appellant was not merely engaged in outright sale of lottery tickets simpliciter but rendered expansive services. The Union sought to explain that the appellant herein issued advertisements, had a right to be consulted in respect of design of a lottery ticket, had a say in the matter of arranging and organizing the lottery, had been authorized to promote and market the online lottery and paid minimum assured revenue of rupees Ten crores per annum to the State of Sikkim. 3.7 It would be relevant to observe that these appellants were/are all carrying on the business of buying and selling of lottery tickets. They purchased the lottery tickets from the State Governments which organized the lotteries and sold the same in various other States or in the States where the lottery business was organized, through stockists and distributors. 3.8 The Central Government sought to levy service tax on the premise that the activity which the appellants were/are carrying on was a business auxiliary service within the definition of Section 65(19) of the Finance Act, 1994 and therefore, chargeable to service tax. The same was resisted by these appellants by filing writ petitions before the High Courts. 3.9 Both the High Courts of Sikkim as well as Kerala have held against these appellants and have opined that service tax is 836 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports leviable on their activity under the nomenclature of business auxiliary service. Hence these appeals. 4. We have heard learned senior counsel Sri S.
