Such factum is sufficient to declare the notification under Section 52(1) for the Moongaska land, invalid. Thus, we uphold the findings of the High Court to this extent. 1030 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 59. This Court in the case of D.B. Basnett (D) through LRs v. Collector, East District, Gangtok, Sikkim and another, reported in (2020) 4 SCC 572 has held that: “14. …even though rights in land are no more a fundamental right, still it remains a constitutional right under Article 300A of the Constitution of India, and the provisions of any Act seeking to divest any person from the rights in property have to be strictly followed. 15. It is also settled law that following the procedure of Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 18942 (akin to Section 5(1) of the said Act) is mandatory, and unless that notice is given in accordance with the provisions contained therein, the entire acquisition proceeding would be vitiated. An entry into the premises based on such non-compliance would result in the entry being unlawful3 . The law being ex-propriatory in character, the same is required to be strictly followed. The purpose of the notice is to intimate the interested persons about the intent to acquire the land. These provisions, as they read, of the said Act, thus, are also required to be so followed.” [Emphasis supplied] Therefore, we are of the view that in cases of compulsory acquisition by the State, it is all the more important that proper service of notice be made to the owners. (iii) On the question of whether the compensation was determined and paid lawfully to the respondents 60. Since we are of the view that the improper service of notice under Section 52(2) invalidates the notification issued under Section 52(1) of the RUI Act for the Moongaksa land, we restrict the discussion regarding compensation to the acquisition proceedings for the Nangli Kota lands. 61. According to the respondent, the Nangli Kota lands came to be vested absolutely and free from all encumbrances on 16.06.1977 that is, when the notification under Section 52(1) was issued and published in the official gazette. Even though the acquisition proceedings for the [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1031 Urban Improvement Trust v. Smt. Vidhya Devi and Ors. Nangli Kota lands were initiated in 1976, the acquisition proceedings remained pending till 1997 when the appellant Trust finally deposited the compensation amount in the reference court. 62. It is clear from the facts that the possession of the Nangli Kota lands was taken by the State Government on 23.10.1980. Thereafter, the Government handed over the possession of the said lands to the appellant Trust on 15.01.1981 under Section 52(7). The lands were also mutated in the name of the appellant Trust on 15.06.1981. 63. It is the case of the appellant Trust and the State Government that the respondents had sent on stamp paper a duly signed statement of admission that they agreed to receive Rs. 90,000/- in lieu of the Nangli Kota lands and that the said amount was acceptable to the State Government.
