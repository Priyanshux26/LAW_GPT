Benefit of interim relief of pay revision was granted to all existing employees who were on pay rolls of MSFC between 01.01.1996 F and 29.03.2010. Only on 29.03.2010, based on communication received from the State Government, MSFC implemented the pay revision recommendations effective only in respect of existing employees and limited the arrears payable from 01.01.2006. The reason for the cut-off date (approved by the State Government) G was “in to motivate the present staff to recover maximum amount in NPA Accounts”. Second justification for denying benefit of pay revision was that fixation of cut-off date falls within state policy domain, which involves among others - the state’s financial concerns, which the courts should not interfere in. [Para 21-23, 26][1181-F-G; 1182-A-C; 1186-D] H MAHARASHTRA STATE FINANCIAL CORP. EX- EMPLOYEES 1171 ASSOC. v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA 1.3 A larger public interest is involved, impelling revision A of pay of public officials and employees. The rationale for periodic pay revisions is to ensure that the salaries and emoluments that public employees enjoy, should keep pace with the increased cost of living and the general inflationary trends, and ensure it does not adversely impact employees. Pay revisions also subserve B other objectives, such as enthusing a renewed sense of commitment and loyalty towards public employment. Another important public interest consideration, is that such revisions are meant to deter public servants from the lure of gratification; of supplementing their income by accepting money or other C inducements for discharging their functions. Article 43 of the Constitution obliges the State to ensure all workers are provided with living wage and assured of a decent standard of living. Need for providing a mechanism to neutralize price increase, through dearness allowance (which is to be on a “sliding scale”) has been D emphasized in past decisions of this court. As a measure of public interest, the State and public employers, have an obligation to periodically address ill-effects of rise in cost of living, on account of price rise, which results in fall in real wages. However, there is no straitjacket formula as to when, and to what extent pay E revision should take place. [Para 27-29][1186-E-H; 1187-A-B; 1188-C-D] Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. B.N. Dongre [1994] 2 Suppl. SCR 217 : (1994) 6 SCC 157 – relied on. F 1.4 Whilst the fixation of cut-off date for the grant of benefits cannot be questioned, what is within the domain of the court, is to examine the impact of such fixation and whether it results in discrimination. The State and MSFC decided not to implement the pay commission recommendation from the date it came into G effect (01.01.1996), but with effect from a decade later (01.01.2006), because the benefit given to employees (or arrears) on the rolls of MSFC as on 29.03.2010 were limited to arrears payable from 01.01.2006. At the same time, fitment and fixation of salary was with effect from 01.01.1996.The fitment formula envisioned the fixation in the new scales, even if notionally, from H 1172 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R.
