Article 19(1)(c) guarantees to all citizens the right to form E associations which are subject to reasonable restrictions under Article 19(4). These reasonable restrictions are not limited to formation of the association but extends to effective functioning of the association relating to lawful objectives. [A.P. Dairy Development Corpn. Federation v. B. Narasimha Reddy12 (two-Judge Bench)] F 11. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Raghubar Dayal Jai Prakash v. Union of India13 (five-Judge Bench), made specific reference to restrictions imposed by statutes, vis-a-vis Article 19 (1)(c) and observed as under: G 7 AIR 1952 SC 329 8 AIR 1963 SC 812 9 (2015) 5 SCC 1 10 2023 SCC Online 6 11 Paragraphs 29 - 31. 12 (2011) 9 SCC 286 H 13 AIR 1962 SC 263 566 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A “11. ... An application for the recognition of the association for the purpose of functioning under the enactment is a voluntary act on the part of the association and if the statute imposes conditions subject to which alone recognition could be accorded or continued, it is a little difficult to see how the freedom to form the association in affected unless, of course, that freedom implies or involves a B guaranteed right to recognition also....”. 12. Furthermore, this Court, while considering the constitutional validity of the Indian Council of World Affairs Ordinance 2001, in Dharam Dutt (supra),while tracing the settled legal position, reiterated that restrictions can be imposed on the right conferred by Article 19(1)(c). It C was observed that this right can be subjected to those restrictions which satisfy the test of Article 19(4) of the Constitution. 13. While adjudicating a case involving the UAPA, in Jamaat-E- Islami Hind v. Union of India14 (three-Judge Bench), with respect to restrictions that may be imposed on such a right under Article 19(4) as D also the requirements of natural justice, it was observed as under: “20. ... The scheme under this Act requiring adjudication of the controversy in this manner makes it implicit that the minimum requirement of natural justice must be satisfied, to make the adjudication meaningful. No doubt, the requirement of natural E justice in a case of this kind must be tailored to safeguard public interest which must always outweigh every lesser interest. This is also evident from the fact that the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Act itself permits the Central Government to withhold the disclosure of facts which it considers to be against F the public interest to disclose. Similarly, Rule 3(2) and the proviso to Rule 5 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Rules, 1968 also permit non-disclosure of confidential documents and information which the Government considers against the public interest to disclose.” “26. An authorised restriction saved by Article 19(4) on G the freedom conferred by Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution has to be reasonable.” (Emphasis supplied) H 14 (1995) 1 SCC 428 ARUP BHUYAN v.
