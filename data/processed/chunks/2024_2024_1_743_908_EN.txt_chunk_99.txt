It may be that this Court by its dated 13.05.2022 passed in Writ Petition No.135 of 2022 had directed the first respondent State of Gujarat to consider the case of respondent No.3 under the 1992 Policy of the State of Gujarat, by setting aside the of the High Court of Gujarat dated 17.07.2019. What is interesting is that in the said writ petition, the State of Gujarat had correctly submitted before this Court that the appropriate Government in the instant case was State of Maharashtra and not the State of Gujarat. The said [2024] 1 S.C.R. 885 Bilkis Yakub Rasool v. Union of India & Others contention was in accordance with the definition of appropriate Government under clause (b) of sub-section (7) of Section 432 of the CrPC. However, the said contention was rejected by this Court contrary to several s of this Court including that of the Constitution Bench in V. Sriharan. But the State of Gujarat failed to file a review petition seeking correction of the of this Court dated 13.05.2022,(particularly when we have now held that the said is a nullity). Complying with the said can also be said to be an instance of usurpation of power when the provision, namely, clause (b) of sub-section (7) of Section 432 states otherwise. 50.2. We fail to understand as to, why, the State of Gujarat, first respondent herein, did not file a review petition seeking correction of the dated 13.05.2022 passed by this Court in Writ Petition No.135 of 2022 in the case of respondent No.3 herein. Had the State of Gujarat filed an application seeking review of the said and impressed upon this Court that it was not the “appropriate Government” but the State of Maharashtra was the “appropriate Government”, ensuing litigation would not have arisen at all. On the other hand, in the absence of filing any review petition seeking a correction of the passed by this Court dated 13.05.2022, the first respondent-State of Gujarat herein has usurped the power of the State of Maharashtra and has passed the impugned s of remission on the basis of an of this Court dated 13.05.2022 which, in our view, is a nullity in law. 50.3. In this regard it is necessary to dilate on the background to this case and refer to the previous s passed by this Court as under:- The first is dated 16.12.2003, referring the matter to the CBI for investigation; the second is an of transfer of the trial from the competent Court in Gujarat to the Special Court at Mumbai and the third is an passed by this Court granting compensation to the petitioner in Writ Petition (Crl.) No.491 of 2022. The relevant portions of the aforesaid s read as under:- W.P.(Crl.) No.118 of 2003, dated 16.12.2003 – referring matter to the CBI for investigation; 886 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “ “Considering the nature of the allegations made, Shri Mukul Rohtagi learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the respondents accepts that further investigation in this case may be done by the CBI, though he does not concede that the Gujarat Police is incompetent to investigate the matter.
