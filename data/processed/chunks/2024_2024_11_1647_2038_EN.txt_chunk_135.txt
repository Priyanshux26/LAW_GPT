It thus emerges that the minority community must largely be free from external control and must have broad autonomy to mould the institution’s functioning and administration per their idea of what would 110 Icon Education Society v.

Naresh Agarwal & Ors. be best for the community.117 If the long-term administrative factors and the day-to-day sundry decisions do not lie with the community, it would mean that the institution is being administered by an outside authority and not by the minority community. As already elucidated, while the minority community can be subjected to general regulations regarding the betterment of such management, and while there can be a sprinkling of outsiders, administration itself cannot be taken away from the minority community. This is perhaps best explained in Gandhi Faiz-e-am-College v. University of Agra,118 where this Court held: “16. The discussion throws us back to a closer study of Statute 14A to see if it cuts into the flesh of the management's right or merely tones up its health and habits. The two requirements the University asks for are that the managing body (whatever its name) must take in (a) the Principal of the College; (b) its senior most teacher. Is this desideratum dismissible as biting into the autonomy of management or tenable as ensuring the excellence of the institution without injuring the essence of the right? On a careful reflection and conscious of the constitutional dilemma, we are inclined to the view that this case falls on the valid side of the delicate line. Regulation which restricts is bad; but regulation which facilitates is good. Where does this fine distinction lie? No rigid formula is possible but a flexible test is feasible. Where the object and effect is to improve the tone and temper of the administration without forcing on it a stranger, however superb his virtues be, where the directive is not to restructure the governing body but to better its performance by a marginal catalytic induction, where no external authority’s fiat or approval or outside nominee is made compulsory to validate the Management Board but inclusion of an internal key functionary appointed by the autonomous management alone is asked for, 117 St. Stephen’s College, supra note 50, para 46.
