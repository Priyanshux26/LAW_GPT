(3) The provisions of sub-rule (2) (b) shall not apply to commodities made of compostable plastic. (4) Any notifi cation prohibiting the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of carry bags, plastic sheets or like, or cover made of plastic sheets and multilayered packaging and single-use plastic, including polystyrene and expanded polystyrene, commodities, issued after this notifi cation, shall come into force after the expiry of ten years, from the date of its publication” 52. The same Rule 4, was also amended in sub-clause (1), to regulate the manufacture of non-woven plastic bags, w.e.f. 01.09.2021: “( j) non-woven plastic carry bag shall not be less than 60 Gram Per Square Meter (GSM) with eff ect from the 30th September, 2021” 53. Given that the amended 2016 Rules now allow non-woven bags above 60 GSM to be manufactured and used, i.e., the Centre has found a way to regulate it, rather than ban it – there is some merit in the appellant’s contention regarding disproportionality. If a less onerous restriction on the appellant’s Article 19(6) right is possible, it must be favoured. In light of the developments in terms of the amendment to the 2016 Rules, this court is of 115 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. the considered opinion that it would be appropriate, and just, to remand the question of including non-woven bags within the single use plastic products ban, back to the TNPCB for consideration. 54. In light of the foregoing discussion, the C.A. No. 8536/2022 is hereby disposed of, seeing no reason to interfere with the High Court’s fi ndings on the ban of reinforced papercups. C.A. Nos.8537-38/2022 are partly allowed in the above terms; wherein the TNPCB is hereby directed to consider the case of non-woven bags afresh, in light of the 2016 Rules (as amended). There shall be no on costs. Headnotes prepared by: C.A. No. 8536/2022 disposed of and C.A. Nos.8537-38/2022 Nidhi Jain partly allowed.
