It is submitted that there is a vast difference between “1st year tariff” and “levelized tariff”. Dr. Singhvi submits that however, if this offer for supply in the first year of the bid is to be levelized for 25 years, it would come to Rs.7.91 per unit, which is around 50% higher than the 1st year tariff of the said bidder itself. 27. Dr. Singhvi submits that M/s Deloitte is a common consultant insofar as the appellants and the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (“UPPCL” for short). He submits that, in fact, BEC of UPPCL, in March 2013, accepted tariff up to Rs. 5.849 per unit i.e., a tariff much higher than that of respondent No.1-MB Power. It is submitted that the bidding period in the present case as well as in the case of UPPCL is the same. It is submitted that, however, in 2018, the Rajasthan BEC mischievously and selectively considered tariff only up to 2012 and compared bids of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, which were, in fact, discovered in 2015 and 2014 respectively. It is submitted that similarly, in the State of Tamil Nadu, for the same period, the equivalent levelized tariff was determined by M/s Deloitte at Rs.5.75 per unit for 25 years and the same was accepted. It is, therefore, submitted that, considering the aforesaid, the levelized tariff of the respondent No.1-MB Power for 25 years at Rs.5.517 per unit is indisputably market aligned even as on 2012-2013. 28. Dr. Singhvi, relied on the following charts to show that the levelized tariff for 25 years, as quoted by the respondent No.1-MB Power, is very much market aligned.

Dr. Singhvi, the learned Senior Counsel, relying on clause 3.5.9 of the RFP, submits that, no negotiations were permissible in spite of the specific clause in the RFP and the opinion to the contrary given by the consultant. It is submitted that the appellants tried to negotiate the prices with L-1 to L-3 bidders, which decision has been finally set aside by this Court vide dated 25th April 2018. 932 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 30. Dr. Singhvi submits that in view of the specific certificate dated 4th June 2013, issued by the BEC, certifying that the bidding procedure for the bids in question had been carried out by the appellants in conformity with the provisions of the RFP and the Bidding Guidelines issued by the Government of India, it is not permissible for the appellants to take a contradictory stand.
