Held : The person intended to be searched under Section 50 must be told in clear and unambiguous words that he has a right to have the search conducted in presence of either a Gazetted Offi cer or Magistrate – The person concerned must be made aware of his right and must be given only two options that have been provided under the section. [Para 56] 292 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 – s.50 – Accused waiving right to be searched in presence of Gazetted Offi cer or Magistrate – Eff ect of – Whether it is still mandatory that his search be conducted only before a Gazetted Offi cer or Magistrate: Held : There is no requirement to conduct the search of the person, suspected to be in possession of a narcotic drug or a psychotropic substance, only in the presence of a Gazetted Offi cer or Magistrate, if the person proposed to be searched, after being apprised by the empowered offi cer of his right under Section 50 of the NDPS Act to be searched before a Gazetted Offi cer or Magistate categorically waives such right by electing to be searched by the empowered offi cer – The words “if such person so requires”, as used in Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act would be rendered otiose, if the person proposed to be searched would still be required to be searched only before a Gazetted Offi cer or Magistrate, despite having expressly waived “such requisition”, as mentioned in the opening sentence of sub-Section (2) of Section 50 of the NDPS Act – In other words, the person to be searched is mandatorily required to be taken by the empowered offi cer, for the conduct of the proposed search before a Gazetted Offi cer or Magistrate, only “if he so requires”, upon being informed of the existence of his right to be searched before a Gazetted Offi cer or Magistrate and not if he waives his right to be so searched voluntarily, and chooses not to exercise the right provided to him under Section 50 of the NDPS Act – However, even when the suspect being apprised by the empowered offi cer of his right under Section 50 of the NDPS Act to be searched before a Gazetted Offi cer or Magistrate waives such right by electing to be searched by the empowered offi cer, such waiver on the part of the suspect should be reduced into writing by the empowered offi cer – To put it in other words, even if the suspect says that he would not like to be searched before a Gazetted Offi cer or Magistrate and he would be fi ne if his search is undertaken by the empowered offi cer, the matter should not rest with just an oral statement of the suspect – The suspect should be asked to give it in writing duly signed by him in presence of the empowered offi cer as well as the other offi cials of the squad – This would lend more credence to the compliance of Section 50 of the NDPS Act – In other words, it would impart authenticity, transparency and credit worthiness to the entire proceedings.
