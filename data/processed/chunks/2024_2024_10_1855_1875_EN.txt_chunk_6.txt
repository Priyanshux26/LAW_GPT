Though the name of Ghafoor was not recorded, Sami Ullah admitted 11/12 share of Zahoor. According to the appellate authority, Zahoor was in continuous possession over the disputed land. The revenue receipts indicated that he was in possession of 1/2 share thereof and paying the revenue in respect of the said land. As regards plot No. 115 of Khata No. 100, the appellate authority concurred with the view of the primary authority. Therefore, the appellate authority i.e. the Assistant Settlement Officer upheld the of the Consolidation Officer and dismissed all the appeals. 13. Two revision petitions were filed under Section 48 of the 1953 Act, Revision No. 3302 was filed by the respondents and Revision No. 3312 was filed by the appellants, against the and dated 25.04.1973 passed by the Assistant Settlement Officer in appeal. 13.1. The revisional authority i.e. the Deputy Director of Consolidation noted that according to Zahoor, the disputed land was joint family property and as such, his share in it was 1/2. Khata No. 98 was recorded in the name of Sami Ullah and Badlu on the one hand and Zahoor on the other hand whereas Khata No. 99 was recorded only in the name of Sami Ullah and Badlu. Consolidation Officer had allowed the name of Zahoor Ahmed to be in half of Khata No. 98 and Khata No. 99; however, 1864 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports dismissed the claim of Zahoor Ahmed in respect of plot No. 115 of Khata No. 100. Against the aforesaid decision, appeal was filed but the same was dismissed. It was thereafter that the revision came to be filed by Zahoor Ahmed. 13.2. On the other hand, Sami Ullah claimed that Zahoor had 1/12 share in Khata No. 98 as well as in Khata No. 99 and none in respect of plot No. 115 of Khata No. 100. His objection was allowed in respect of plot No. 115 of Khata No. 100 but was dismissed in respect of the other two Khatas. Therefore, he also filed appeals before the Assistant Settlement Officer which were however dismissed. Thereafter, the related revision petition came to be filed claiming 5/6th share in Khata No. 98 and exclusively claimed Khata No. 99 for himself and Badlu. 13.3. During the revision proceedings, Zahoor Ahmed died and he was substituted by his legal heirs (sons) Nisar Ahmed, Irshan Ahmed and Ishtiyag Ahmed. The revisional authority considered the claim of Sami Ullah. Zahoor Ahmed had disputed 1/12th share in Khata No. 98 because in the year 1922, the disputed land was taken on lease by Abdul Ghafoor: 5/6th share from Mohammad Ismail and 1/6th share from the zamindar. Mohammad Ismail died in the year 1942. After his death, his 1/6th share got devolved in 1/12th share, viz, in plot Nos. 35, 57, 111 and 112. It was noted that Khata No. 99 was recorded in the name of Sami Ullah and Badlu. The revisional authority noted on the basis of the evidence adduced that Shakoor had expired in the year 1930.
