Digital Supreme Court Reports which he was being arrested so as to provide him an opportunity of defending himself against custodial remand and to seek bail – Thus, the ‘grounds of arrest’ would invariably be personal to the accused and cannot be equated with the ‘reasons of arrest’ which are general in nature. [Para 49] Constitution of India – Article 141 – Plea of the respondent that the in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India and Others [2023] 12 SCR 714 relied upon by the accused- appellant would not apply to the proceedings of remand made on 4.10.2023 as the appellant was remanded to police custody on 4.10.2023 whereas the in Pankaj Bansal was uploaded on the website of Supreme Court in the late hours of 4.10.2023 and hence, the arresting officer could not be expected to ensure compliance of the directions given therein and thus, the alleged inaction of the IO in furnishing the grounds of arrest in writing to the appellant cannot be called into question as the in Pankaj Bansal was uploaded and brought in public domain after the remand had been passed: Held: Said plea is misconceived – Indisputably, the appellant was remanded to police custody on 4.10.2023 whereas the in the case of Pankaj Bansal was delivered on 3.10.2023 – Merely on a conjectural submission regarding the late uploading of the , the respondent cannot be permitted to argue that the ratio of Pankaj Bansal would not apply to the present case – Once this Court has interpreted the provisions of the statute in context to the constitutional scheme and has laid down that the grounds of arrest have to be conveyed to the accused in writing expeditiously, the said ratio becomes the law of the land binding on all the Courts in the country by virtue of Article 141 of the Constitution of India.
