Unless the person possessing the land has a requisite animus the period for prescription does not commence. As in the instant case, the appellant categorically states that his possession is not adverse as that of true owner, the logical corollary is that he did 10 [2005] Supp. 4 SCR 253 : (2005) 8 SCC 330 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 731 Neelam Gupta & Ors. v. Rajendra Kumar Gupta & Anr. not have the requisite animus. (See Mohd. Mohd. Ali v. Jagadish Kalita [(2004) 1 SCC 271])” 38. The decision of this Court in M. Durai v. Muthu and Others,11 reiterated the law laid down, as above in Saroop Singh’s case, and further held thus: - “7. The change in the position in law as regards the burden of proof as was obtaining in the Limitation Act, 1908 vis-à-vis the Limitation Act, 1963 is evident. Whereas in terms of Articles 142 and 144 of the old Limitation Act, the plaintiff was bound to prove his title as also possession within twelve years preceding the date of institution of the suit under the Limitation Act, 1963, once the plaintiff proves his title, the burden shifts to the defendant to establish that he has perfected his title by adverse possession.” 39. The law laid down in Saroop Singh’s case was again reiterated by this Court in the decision in Prasanna & Ors. v. Mudegowda (D) by LRs12 and Vasantha v. Rajalakshmi.13 40. In the light of Saroop Singh’s case there can be no doubt that once the plaintiff proves his title over suit property it is for the defendant resisting the same claiming adverse possession that he perfected title through adverse possession and in that regard, in terms of Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963 the starting point of limitation would not commence from the date when the right of ownership arises to the plaintiff but would commence only from the date the defendant’s becomes adverse. 41. In the decision in Brij Narayan Shukla (D) through LRs. v. Sudesh Kumar alias Suresh Kumar (D) through LRs. and Ors.,14 this Court while considering the question whether tenants of original owner could claim adverse possession against transferee of land lord held that tenants or lessees could not claim adverse possession 11 [2007] 1 SCR 816 : (2007) 3 SCC 114 12 2023 SCC OnLine SC 511 13 [2024] 2 SCR 326 : 2024 SCC OnLine SC 132 14 (2024) 2 SCC 590 732 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports against their landlord/lessor, as the nature of their possession is permissive in nature. 42. In the contextual situation, especially in view of the nature of the evidence adduced by the defendants in setting up and supporting the claim of adverse possession, the decisions of this Court in Ravinder Kaur Grewal and Ors. v. Manjit Kaur and Ors.15 and the decision of a Constitution Bench in M. Siddiq (D) through LRs (Ram Janmabhumi Temple case) v. Mahant Suresh Das and Ors.16 require reference. Paragraph 60 of the decision in Ravinder Kaur Grewal’s case, in so far as it is relevant, reads thus: - “60.
