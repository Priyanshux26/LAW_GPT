If the gap between the time of last seen and the deceased found dead is long, then the possibility of other person coming in between cannot be ruled out. 3 (2005) 3 SCC 114 H 346 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 18. In the present case, according to the complainant/PW-1, the deceased was taken away by the accused persons on the night of 20th November 2000 at 08.00 p.m. Though, it is the contention of the appellant that he was taken into illegal custody on 21st November, 2000 and his arrest was shown on 25th November, 2000, we do not find it necessary to go into that aspect of the matter. A perusal of the evidence of the IO B would reveal that, on 25th November, 2000, on the basis of secret information that Boby (accused No.3/appellant herein) was standing at Manaloor Kadavu, he proceeded to that place and arrested him at 02.00 p.m. He stated that, on the basis of his confession, various articles were seized from his house. He further stated that thereafter on the same C day, the accused led them towards the place in Bharathapuzha where the deceased was buried. He stated that, after seeing the loose soil, the scene was guarded as it was an odd time. He further stated that, on 26th November 2000, as led by accused No. 3, they reached the place and the Tahasildar, Ottapalam prepared the inquest report. D 19. It can thus clearly be seen that firstly, there is a gap of at least five days from the date on which, according to PW-1, the deceased was taken away by the accused persons and the dead body was recovered. However, the crucial question would be as to whether it can be held that the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that the recovery E of dead body was at the instance of Boby (accused No. 3/appellant herein). Only in the event the prosecution establishes that the recovery of the body was at the instance of Boby (accused No. 3/appellant herein), the relevancy of the gap of five days would come. 20. As early as 1946, the Privy Council had considered the F provisions of Section 27 of the Evidence Act in the case of Pulukuri Kotayya and Others v. King-Emperor4. It will be relevant to refer to the following observations of the Privy Council in the said case: “The second question, which involves the construction of s. 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, will now be considered. That section G and the two preceding sections, with which it must be read, are in these terms.
