However, Clause 6.3.1(d) which is titled “Proposal for Resolution of Outstanding Airport and Parking Dues (Rs. 240 Crores as of August 31, 2020” is attached with the following qualification: “The Resolution Applicant states and confirms that this “Proposal for Resolution of outstanding airport and parking dues (approx. Rs. 240 Crores as of August 31,2020)” which deals with the appropriation of the BKC Property is merely a proposal and not a condition to the implementation of this Resolution Plan and the CoC has the discretion to accept/ reject such a proposal. If the above-mentioned proposal is acceptable to the CoC, then it is acceptable to the Resolution Applicant in the manner stated hereinabove”. (emphasis supplied) The contention of the SRA is that the aforesaid qualification applies equally to the part of Clause 6.3.1(d) under the heading “BKC Property not part of resolution” and that the entire Clause 6.3.1(d) would remain a proposal and not a binding condition on the SRA. Irrespective of a determination on the same, even as per Clause 6.4.1, the payment towards CIRP costs including Airport Charges had to be made in full, in priority, within 180 days from the Effective Date. This is evident from – (a) Clause 6.4.1(a) which states that the CIRP Costs are to be paid in priority to any other creditor of the Corporate Debtor in terms of Section 30(2)(a) of the IBC, 2016; (b) Clause 6.4.1(k) which states that the outstanding CIRP costs shall be paid by the Resolution Applicant out of the funds infused by the Resolution Applicant in the Corporate Debtor and as per the Implementation Schedule set out in Clause 7.7 below; (c) Clause 6.4.1(m) which states that the CIRP cost shall be “fully paid and discharged after the Effective Date” before payment is made to any of the creditors as per the [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2141 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. Resolution Plan; (d) Clause 6.4.1(n) which states that the Resolution Applicant has sufficient funds and that the CIRP costs shall be met out of funds infused by the Resolution Applicant; and (e) S.No. 16 of the Implementation Schedule under Clause 7.7 which states that the CIRP costs must be paid as per Clause 6.4.1 within Z+170 days. 132. Therefore, the SRA not having infused the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore as per Clause 6.3.1(g) and S. No. 11 of the Implementation Schedule under Clause 7.7 within a period of 180 days from the Effective Date and within the multiple extensions granted therefrom, has defaulted on its obligation towards the payment of CIRP costs (which include airport dues) under Clause 6.4.1 as well. b. Whether Respondent No.1/SRA could be said to have failed to implement the Resolution Plan on account of the non-payment of workmen and employees’ dues as per the terms of the Resolution Plan and the of the NCLT dated 21.10.2022 which was confirmed by the dated 31.01.2023 of this Court?
