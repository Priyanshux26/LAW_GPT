According to the learned senior counsel, the hands of the investigating agency were tied due to the stay and that once the appeals arising out of the two substantial s of the High Court dated 01.09.2022 and 31.10.2022 are disposed of, the State will take expeditious steps. F 129. For the present, we would accept the explanation offered by the alleged contemnors. This is for the reason that the alleged contemnors alone are not to be blamed for where we are. The entire case turned out to be a match where it became impossible to identify who was playing for which team. Despite this Court’s dated 08.09.2022, the High Court passed the dated 31.10.2022, which G practically has the effect of wiping out the directions issued by this Court. In its dated 31.10.2022, the High Court referred to our at various places and eventually destroyed the effect of the of this Court. Therefore, the Police Officers alone cannot be held guilty of wilful disobedience. Hence, the contempt petitions are dismissed. H 1096 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A However, if the future course of investigation shows any disobedience of the s of this Court, it will always be open to the petitioner to come up again. With this observation, the contempt petitions are dismissed. I.A.No. 26257 of 2023 B 130. This is an application taken out by Y. Balaji, appellant in some of these appeals, seeking the constitution of a Special Investigation Team and the appointment of a Special Public Prosecutor. This application is filed on the ground that the hope expressed by this Court in its dated 08.09.2022 that the State Police would do a proper job, has been C belied by subsequent events. Therefore, the applicant prays that time is now ripe for the constitution of a Special Investigation Team. 131. The application is opposed on the ground, (i) that a prayer of this nature cannot be made by way of an interlocutory application; and (ii) that the allegation of the prosecution being influenced by the Minister does not stand substantiated. D 132. As we have pointed out while dealing with the contempt petitions, the entire blame for this fiasco cannot be laid at the doorstep of the Police alone. We find several coparceners. Hence, we reject this I.A. at this stage with liberty to the applicant to come back with a substantial petition seeking such a prayer, at a later point of time, when E a foul play is suspected. Accordingly, I.A. No.26257 of 2023 is dismissed with the above liberty. Results summed up 133. The result of the entire discussion is summed up as follows: F (i) The appeals arising out of the for de novo investigation are allowed. That portion of the of the High Court dated 31.10.2022 passed in Criminal O.P. No. 15122 of 2021 is set aside. The directions issued in the said original petition for de novo investigation are set aside. The Investigation Officer shall proceed with further investigation in all G cases by including the offences under the PC Act.
