The area of the respondent College (Anupama College) was also declared as a Controlled Area. Thereafter, on 06.03.2006, First Show-Cause Notice was issued by the predecessor of the appellant herein to the respondent regarding additional construction raised in Anupama College. The representatives of the first respondent sought time to file a reply. When the matter stood thus on 19.06.2006, the appellant was appointed as District Town Planner (Enforcement), Gurgaon. 26. As there was no reply to the show-cause notice and the construction continued, the appellant herein issued restoration under Section 12(2) of the Act on 09.10.2006. The appellant also lodged FIR No.364 dated 13.10.2006 with Police Station Bilaspur. Subsequently, on the request made by the appellant, the District Magistrate deputed two Duty Magistrates for overlooking the demolition. On 04.02.2007 and 05.02.2007, the demolition operation of the additional unauthorized construction was carried out. The respondent made a complaint against the appellant to the Senior Town Planner, Town and Country Planning Department stating that the appellant had demanded illegal gratification of Rs.20 lakhs and when that was not paid, the appellant had carried the demolition of the main building without serving any notice and thereby causing loss to the College. The appellant informed the Director, Town and Country Planning that all the construction raised after the date of notification had been demolished. 27. Subsequently, a second show-cause notice under Section 12(2) was issued owing to re-erection of the demolished portion. On 12.03.2007, the appellant relinquished her charge of DTP (E), Gurgaon owing to her transfer. Subsequently, on 05.04.2007, a preliminary report was submitted by the ADC Gurgaon to the effect that the demolition was unlawful. 28. CWP No.6425 of 2017 was filed by the first respondent before the High Court seeking quashing of second show-cause notice dated 12.03.2007. The appellant herein was arraigned as respondent no.4 in the said writ petition. In response to the said writ petition, the ADC Gurgaon submitted modified and amended report specifically holding that the demolition was as per law. Another restoration was 1626 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports passed on 21.08.2007 due to continued unauthorized construction by the respondent. However, later on, accepting the report of the Local Commissioner, the High Court vacated the stay granted to the first respondent, while observing that the ADC Report had been filed by the Government and the first respondent herein had threatened the Local Commissioner and deserves no relief. 29. That, it is only after lapse of three years from the date of demolition, first respondent herein filed a Criminal Complaint No.1383 of 2010 under Sections 34, 148, 149, 166, 323, 384, 427, 440, 452 and 506 IPC in the Court of Additional CJM, Gurgaon against 13 accused. The JMFC discharged all other accused except the appellant and accused nos.2 and 4 in Complaint No.1383 of 2010 and the summoning was passed against the appellant and accused nos.2 and 4, namely, Senior Town Planner and Junior Engineer, Town & Country Planning (E). 30. It is in the aforesaid circumstances that the appellant filed the petition under Section 482 CrPC before the High Court seeking for quashing of the summoning dated 20.11.2014, in which initially a stay was granted and thereafter the said CRM-M was dismissed as not maintainable.
