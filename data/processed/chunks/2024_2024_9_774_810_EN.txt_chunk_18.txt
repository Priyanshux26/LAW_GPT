It further appears that though the said Application under Section 482 was allowed by the High Court vide the dated 16.12.2019, a Vakalatnama with the thumb impression of Bhagwan Singh was sought to be filed by the Advocates, Mr. Jai Singh Yadav and Mr. P.B. Mishra on 30.11.2023 i.e. almost 4 years after the disposal of the said Application. 22. From the record of the said Application being No. 41533/2019, it further appears that a Criminal Miscellaneous Recall Application No.3/2020 was sought to be filed in the name of the applicant- Rinki by Advocates Arun Kumar Mishra and Hemant Kumar Srivastava, seeking recall of the dated 16.12.2019 in the said Application no. 41533/2019. It is very pertinent to note that in the said Recall Application, Mr. Sukhpal filed an affidavit on 01.02.2020 in support of the Recall Application though he was not a party to the proceedings. The Advocate Mr. Karan Singh Yadav appeared for the opponent No.2 Bhagwan Singh, though in the record there is no Vakalatnama filed by Karan Singh Yadav for Bhagwan Singh either in the Recall Application proceedings or in the Main Application under Section 482. As transpiring from the dated 02.04.2024, it appears that the main contention raised by Mr. Karan Singh was that the opponent no.2 Bhagwan Singh was not given opportunity of filing counter affidavit before passing the on 16.12.2019 in the Main Application under Section 482. 23. It further appears that Criminal Miscellaneous Recall Application Nos. 7/2020 and 8/2021 were also filed by one Advocate Mr. Alok Kumar Yadav on 20.12.2020 seeking condonation of delay and on 28.11.2020 seeking recall of the dated 16.12.2019. Along with the said Applications, one affidavit with the signature of said Advocate Alok Kumar Yadav, without the signature of Bhagwan Singh on whose behalf it was sought to be filed and without the [2024] 9 S.C.R. 801 Bhagwan Singh v. State of U.P. & Ors. signature of the Oath Commissioner, was sought to be filed. The said Alok Yadav also filed his Vakalatnama on 28.11.2021 with the alleged thumb mark of Bhagwan Singh. All the said three Recall applications were argued by the Advocate Karan Singh Yadav purportedly on behalf of Bhagwan Singh, who was opponent No.2 in the main proceedings under Section 482 filed by Ajay Katara. The Recall Application No.3/2020 came to be rejected by the Court vide dated 02.04.2024 by observing that the main case was argued by the two reputed Senior Advocates appearing for the opponent No.2, as stated in the dated 16.12.2019. The other two Recall Applications being No. 7/2020 and 8/2021 were not pressed for by the said Advocate Mr. Karan Singh Yadav and therefore were dismissed vide the said dated 02.04.2024. 24. From the said proceedings of the High Court, it clearly emerges that though there was no Vakalatnama filed on behalf of Bhagwan Singh who was opponent No.2 in the Application under Section 482 No. 41533 of 2019, two Senior Advocates and other Advocates made their submissions on behalf of Bhagwan Singh.
