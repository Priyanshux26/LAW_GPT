12. On the civil nature of the dispute, it was submitted that the issue pertains to interpretation of various clauses of the PoA, which cannot be done in a criminal proceeding and rightly the Revisional Court had held it to be a civil dispute. It was also pointed out that the Buxar Courts would lack territorial jurisdiction. 13. It was submitted that the Original Suit No. 27 of 2011, filed by the respondent no.2 and others, at Dehradun, was prior to filing of the FIR, which was dismissed by dated 07.12.2017 holding that the PoA holder had the right to sell the land, receive the consideration and hence the Sale deed was valid. The contention that the respondent no.2 and others had no knowledge of the Sale Deed dated 24.08.2000 could not be believed and the suit was also held to be time-barred as the prayer was for setting aside the Sale Deed dated 24.08.2000. 14. Learned senior counsel relied upon the decision in Mukul Agrawal v State of Uttar Pradesh, (2020) 3 SCC 402, wherein at Paragraph 71, it has been held that the finding of the Civil Court that the agreement was not a forged document, makes the very substratum of the criminal complaint vanish. 15. Reliance was also placed on the decision of K G Premshankar v Inspector of Police, (2002) 8 SCC 87, where at Paragraphs 15, 16, 30-322, Sections 40-43, of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 have 1 ‘7. In view of the conclusive opinion of the appellate court that the agreement dated 30-3-1988 was not a forged document, the very substratum of the criminal complaint vanishes. In the circumstances to allow the appellants to be prosecuted will only be a complete abuse of the process of law. The proceedings in Complaint Case No. 2705 of 2003 are therefore quashed and the appeal is allowed.’ 2 ‘15. Learned Additional Solicitor-General Shri Altaf Ahmed appearing for the respondents submitted that the observation made by this Court in V.M. Shah case [(1995) 5 SCC 767 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 1077] that “the finding recorded by the criminal court, stands superseded by the finding recorded by the civil court and thereby the finding of the civil court gets precedence over the finding recorded by the criminal court” (SCC p. 770, para 11) is against the law laid down by this Court in various decisions. For this, he rightly referred to the provi- 1172 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports been interpreted with regard to the relevance of decision of a Civil Court on criminal proceedings against the same person(s) pertaining to the same cause. As far as territorial jurisdiction is concerned, it was the stand of the learned senior counsel that the only link in the chain is that the PoA was executed at Buxar, but in the present case, there is no dispute with regard to execution of the PoA and the dispute relates only to execution of the Sale Deed which occurred in Dehradun where the land lies.
