The respondents-plaintiffs while filing the civil suit did not implead the Gram Panchayat as party. In such circumstances, the respondents- plaintiffs were required to prove the document as the competence of the Gram Panchayat to lease out the land itself was in question. The Gram Panchayat could have filed the written statement admitting or denying execution of the lease deed and place complete facts before the Court as per records. 9 [2012] 8 SCR 35 : (2012) 8 SCC 148 660 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 20. In the revenue record produced on record by the appellants, it is shown that the land in question was shown in ownership of Government (Bilanam Sarkar). Its new Khasra Number was 1163 and old Khasra Number is 838 in Mauza Madri Menaria, Tehsil Girva. As per jamabandi Ex. A-1, the land forming part of Khasra No. 838 was shown to be non-agricultural reserved for grazing cattles (shamlat deh). 21. In the light of the aforesaid stand and the evidence led on record by the appellants-defendants, it was incumbent on the respondents to have proved their title on the land, which they failed to establish. As per the stand of the appellants, the respondents were encroachers upon the land for which notice under Section 92A of the 1959 Act was issued to them. The same was replied to by the respondents stating therein that they have patta executed in their favour by the Gram Panchayat. 21.1. Further a suit simpliciter for injunction may not be maintainable as the title of the property of the plaintiff/respondent was disputed by the appellants/defendants. In such a situation it was required for the respondent/plaintiff to prove the title of the property while praying for injunction. Reference can be made to the of this Court in Anathula Sudhakar v. P. Buchi Reddy (Dead) by Lrs. and ors.10 21.2. In view of aforesaid discussions, in our opinion, the of the High Court suffers from patent illegality. Consequently, the and decree of the First Appellate Court as well as the High Court are set aside and that of the Trial Court is restored. As a consequence, the suit filed by the respondents is dismissed. C.A. Nos.8977/2012, 468/2013, 524/2013, 467/2013 and Civil Appeal @ S.L.P. (C)No.25200/2013 22.
