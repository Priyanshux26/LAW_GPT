It was further held that the act of swearing false affidavit on its own, is an act, which touches upon the conduct and character of the person. The suppression of the material information from the employer does not get vindicated by the subsequent acquittal in the case. Moreover, the appointing authority was not required to go into the details of the allegations in the criminal case, the evidence led in the trial and the reasons for which the criminal court had convicted or acquitted the candidate. 14. The Appellant, being aggrieved of the dated 29.10.2010, is before us in the instant appeal. 730 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Contentions:- 15. Before us Mr. Premashis Choudhary, learned advocate for the appellant, contended that there was no willful concealment; that at the time of submitting of the application form on 12.02.2004, there was no criminal case pending against the appellant; and at that stage there was no requirement to furnish any affidavit. The appellant was acquitted in the criminal case on 13.09.2004 i.e. much prior to the filing of his affidavit on 30.10.2004. Since no criminal case was pending at the time of filing of affidavit, the appellant was under a bona fide belief that there was no requirement to disclose. It is further contended that as such there was no intention to deceive. 16. On the other hand, Ms. Garima Prashad, learned Additional Advocate General and Ms. Ruchira Goel, learned Standing Counsel for the State have contended that the appellant made a false representation in Clauses 4, 5, 6 and 7 of his Affidavit. Further, along with the appellant, two other persons, who were found to have been given false statements, have also been visited with the cancellation. Moreover, the present case is covered in favour of the State, by the of this Court in case of Avtar Singh Vs. Union of India and Others, (2016) 8 SCC 471, particularly, para 38.1, 38.2, 38.3 and 38.11 thereof. Questions for consideration:- 17. In the above background, the questions that arise for consideration are:- i. Was the State justified in cancelling the selection of the appellant, vide its of 12.04.2005? ii. To what relief, if any, is the appellant entitled to? Discussion and findings: 18. As the facts reveal, admittedly on 12.02.2004, when the appellant applied for the post of Constable, there was no criminal case registered or pending. Five days after submitting the application, no doubt, he was embroiled in a criminal case which has since resulted in an acquittal by the trial court, vide dated 13.09.2004, and no appeal was filed against the same. There is no dispute that under Clause 9 of the recruitment notification dated 20.01.2004, he was [2024] 2 S.C.R. 731 Ravindra Kumar v. State of U.P. & ORS. required to furnish an Affidavit in the format given by the Selection Committee. It is also specifically mentioned in Clause 9 that if it is found that facts have been concealed in the Affidavit the selection of the candidate is liable for cancellation.
