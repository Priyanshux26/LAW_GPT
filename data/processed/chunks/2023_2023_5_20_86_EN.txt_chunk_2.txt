The learned counsel appearing for the Defendant No. 2 (Respondent No. 2 herein) that a cross-appeal under XLI Rule 22 of the F CPC is as effective as a regular first appeal and the same would sustain, even if, the regular first appeal is dismissed or withdrawn. A cross-appeal is the exercise of substantive right of appeal and only the procedure varies. The cross-appeal objector is entitled under XLI Rule 22 of the CPC read with XLIII Rule 1-A (2) of the CPC, to make good the submission that she G was entitled in law to question the legality and validity of the settlement agreement recorded under XXIII Rule 3 of the CPC by way of a cross-appeal.
