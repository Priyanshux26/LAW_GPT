Sajjan Sing v State of Rajasthan Mad LJ: QD (1961-1965) Vol II C 1204-1205: (1965) 1 SCJ 377 : (1965)1 Mad LJ (SC) 57 : AIR 1965 SC 845 *************** ************** Amend; emend; Correct; Rectify; Reform. All these words convey the idea of making a things into a more perfect state. We correct when we conform things to some standard or rule; as to correct proof sheets. We amend by removing faults or errors as to amend a decree or a law. Emend is another form of amend and is mostly applied to editions of books. To reform is to put into a new and better form, as to reform one’s life. Rectify is to make right, as, to rectify a mistake, to rectify an abuse. The amendment of a law may in a proper case include the deletion of any one or more of the provisions of the law and substitution in their place of new provisions. An amendment of the constitution which is the subject-matter of the power conferred by Article 368, may include modifi cations or change of the provisions or even an amendment which makes the said provisions inapplicable in certain cases. Sajjan Singh v State of Rajasthan AIR 1965 SC 845, 854. [Constitution of India, Article 368] The term ‘amended in Section 1(2) of the Calcutta Trika Tenancy Amendment Act must be construed in its natural meaning ‘as altered by addition, substitutions and omissions’. Deorajin Debi v Satyadhyan, AIR 1954 Cal 119.” 196 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 97. It is, therefore, held that there were no limitations under Section 19 (read together with Article 246A), of the Amendment. That provision constituted the expression of the sovereign legislative power, available to both Parliament and state legislatures, to make necessary changes through amendment to the existing laws. As held in Rama Krishna Ramanath (supra) the transitional power (in that case, Section 143 (3)) “the provision by its implication confers a limited legislative power to desire or not to desire the continuance of the levy.” This limited legislative power was not constricted or limited, in the manner alleged by the states; it is circumscribed by the time limit, indicated (i.e. one year, or till the new GST law was enacted). It could, therefore, enact provisions other than those bringing the existing provisions in conformity with the amended Constitution. C. Validity of Telangana Act tested from the touch stone of its originating as an ordinance 98. Telangana had argued that although with eff ect from 1st July 2017, due to the enactment of the CGST Act, its state legislature could not per se enact a new law on a subject matter contained within the original entry 54 of the State list, nevertheless, the approval of the ordinance which amended the existing State -law on 02.07.2017 had the eff ect of relating back to the original date when in fact it was validly amended. This is sought to be supported by the theory of the relating back of the law to a date when the power to enact existed.
