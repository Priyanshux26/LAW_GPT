There is no inconsistency in the two provisions. It only furthers the cause introduced vide section 12A of IBC. NCLT fell in error in taking a contrary view. [Paras 34 and 35][612-F-G; 613-A-C] F 1.6 From a perusal of the of the NCLT it appears that it was annoyed with the conduct of CD and its counsel. NCLT has recorded its displeasure and annoyance at a couple of places referring to the conduct of the CD and its counsel before the NCLAT, and maybe for this reason, the NCLT passed the G impugned ignoring the observation in the NCLAT dated 26.03.2021 which had specifically expressed that the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) would pass s on the withdrawal application without standing on technicalities. [Para 39][614-E-F] H ABHISHEK SINGH v. HUHTAMAKI PPL LTD. & ANR. 599 1.7 At the time when the application for withdrawal of the A proceedings was filed the CoC was not constituted as such there could not have been any other concerned parties except the OC, CD and IRP. It was only because of the delay caused by the NCLT in disposing of the applications under section 12A of IBC and Regulation 30A that large number of creditors filed their claims. B The inherent powers are to be invoked in to meet the ends of justice which, in our opinion, the NCLT failed to invoke. Regulation 30A of IBBI Regulations provide a complete mechanism for dealing with the applications filed under such provision. The issue raised by the IRP regarding its claim for expenses is well taken care of under the said provision. Various C safeguards have been provided in Regulation 30A of IBBI Regulations to be fulfilled by the OC which apparently have been fulfilled as there is no complaint in that regard either by the IRP nor it is apparent from the impugned of the NCLT. Thus, the objection raised by the IRP does not merit any consideration D in this appeal. [Para 40, 41][614-G-H; 615-A-C] 1.8 The impugned of NCLT cannot be sustained and is set aside. The application for withdrawal u/s 12A is allowed along with the application under Regulation 30A of IBBI Regulations. The Application u/s 9 of IBC filed by the OCs shall E stand withdrawn.
