Any seniority list of Junior Engineer which may have been circulated earlier will not have any bearing in [2024] 8 S.C.R. 715 Mhabemo Ovung & Ors. v. M. Moanungba & Ors. the case in hand. After the direct recruitment of the Junior Engineers a tentative seniority list was circulated on 31.05.2004. Its finalization remained pending for years. During the interregnum 47 posts of Sectional Officer, Grade-I, working in the Nagaland Public Works Department were upgraded to Junior Engineer (Class-II Gazetted) vide Letter dated 11.10.2007. After considering claims and objections of all the incumbents working in the cadre of Junior Engineers, the seniority list was finalized on 26.03.2018. 10. The appellants in C.A.@S.L.P. (C)No.17102 of 2021 were shown at Serial Nos.71, 72, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 & 80 in the aforesaid seniority list; they being the direct recruits. Respondent Nos.1 to 16 who were earlier working as Sectional Officer, Grade-I, the post which was subsequently upgraded as Junior Engineer vide letter dated 11.10.2007 were shown at Serial Nos.156, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 157, 158, 159, 174 & 179. 11. Aggrieved against the aforesaid seniority list, two writ petitions were filed before the High Court. W.P. (C) No.74(K) of 2019 was filed by the respondent Nos.1 to 16 herein whereas W.P. (C)No.264(K) of 2018 was filed by 29 other incumbents who were earlier working as Sectional Officer, Grade-I, the post which was upgraded to Junior Engineer vide dated 11.10.2007. 12. Learned Single Judge rightly dismissed both the writ petitions as the Sectional Officer, Grade-I, whose post was upgraded only on 11.10.2007 as Junior Engineers could not be treated to be senior to the Junior Engineers who were directly recruited on 01.05.2003. The impugned seniority list as circulated on 26.03.2018 was upheld. 13. A perusal of the impugned of the Division Bench of the High Court shows that it had totally misdirected itself while examining the 1997 Rules; the date of appointment of the private contesting respondents as Sectional Officer, Grade-I and the date of their regularization as such. The aforesaid facts were not of any relevance for the decision of the question of seniority amongst the members of the cadre of Junior Engineers. All what was required to be considered was the date on which they became members of the cadre of Junior Engineers coming from two different sources. As to whether the upgradation of the post was right or wrong is not an issue canvassed before this Court. The Division Bench of the High Court has further gone wrong in considering the upgradation of post 716 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of Sectional Officer and certain other posts to that Junior Engineers prior to 01.05.2003 when direct recruitment to the post of Junior Engineers was made for the first time. That historical background did not have any relevance for the reason that prior to 2003 never before in the cadre of Junior Engineers there was recruitment from two different sources. The dispute arose only thereafter.
