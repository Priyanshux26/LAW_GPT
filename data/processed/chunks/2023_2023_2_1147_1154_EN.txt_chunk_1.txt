In this entire process from the sale of the goods to the goods Actually being used by the end consumer, the purchaser military and paramilitary institutions become industrial consumers, as they serve as an intermediary between the end consumer and the E original purchaser. Due to the purchasers, on account of them being institutional consumers, are exempt from the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, and since Section 4(A) of the Act mandates the applicability of the abovesaid rules, the transaction automatically becomes ineligible to claim refuge under Section 4(A) of the Act. [Paras 9, 10][1152-F-H] F 1.3 For the sale of goods to take refuge under Section 4(A) of the Act and pass the test of point (iii) in the Jayanti , there must be a requirement in the the Legal Metrology Act, 2009 or the rules made thereunder to declare the price of such goods relating to their retail price on the package. In simpler G terms, it would mean that for a sale of goods to take assessment benefits under Section 4(A) of the Act, it must be a retail sale, and there must be a mandate of law that directs the seller to affix a retail price on the goods for a sale to be considered a retail sale. A mere affixation of the MRP on a good does not qualify it to H COMMISSIONER OF CENTRAL EXCISE & SERVICE TAX, KANPUR v. 1149 M/S. A. R. POLYMERS PVT. LTD. ETC. claim benefits under Section 4(A) of the Act, and that there must A be a “requirement” for the affixation of such MRP. [Paras 12, 13][1153-B-D] 1.4 A consumer, as clarified by the Jayanti Foods , is the final consumer of the product, and not the intermediary. In the present case at hand however, the purchaser institutions, B are intermediaries, who after the purchase of the said goods, distribute it further to the final consumer. In such a circumstance, where the purchaser institution is deemed to not be a consumer, the sale also cannot be held to be a retail sale as per the Act. Further, since the impugned sale is not a retail sale as per the C Act, there exists no mandate of law on the Respondent herein to affix an MRP on the goods sold, and hence the said impugned transaction cannot claim benefit under Section 4(A) of the Act. The CESTAT committed an error in law by passing the impugned dated 09.01.2019 and the Respondent being under an obligation is directed to pay the differential amount to the relevant D tax authority.
