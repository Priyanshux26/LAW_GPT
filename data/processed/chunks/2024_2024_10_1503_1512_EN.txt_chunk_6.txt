This is because the parties have entered into commercial transactions with full awareness of the implications of compliance and non-compliance with the concerned contracts and the consequences which will visit them in law. Hence, the argument that the High Court was correct in directing the respondent to furnish bank guarantees in relation to the amount awarded because it is a statutory body is rejected. 1512 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 16. In Toyo Engineering Corpn. v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd.,5 this Court reiterated the same principle in the following terms: “3. This Court repeatedly having held that XLI Rule 5 principles are to be followed in these cases, we find that largely because public corporations are involved, discretion continues to be exercised not on principles under XLI Rule 5 but only because large amounts exist and that Government Corporations have to pay these amounts under Arbitral Awards. Both these considerations are irrelevant, as has been pointed out by us earlier.” 17. Under XLI Rule 5 of the CPC, the Court has the power to direct full or part deposit and/or the furnishing of security in respect of the decretal amount. Bearing in mind the principles which must guide the Court, we are of the view that the of the High Court requires modification. In modification of the direction of the High Court in the impugned dated 9 September 2024, we direct that: (i) The respondent shall deposit an amount quantified at 75% of the decretal amount, inclusive of interest, on or before 30 November 2024 before the High Court; and (ii) Conditional on the deposit of the aforesaid amount within the period stipulated above, there shall be a stay on the enforcement of the arbitral award. 18. The impugned of the High Court shall stand modified in the above terms. The appeal is allowed accordingly. 19. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal Allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain 5 2021 SCC OnLine SC 3455
