We may also add at this juncture that Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] is a unanimous of five learned Judges of this Court which has held sway since the year 2006. This has been repeatedly followed and applied by a number of s of this Court, namely: 28.1. Anil Chandra v. Radha Krishna Gaur [Anil Chandra v. Radha Krishna Gaur, (2009) 9 SCC 454 : (2009) 2 SCC (L&S) 683] (two-Judge Bench) (see paras 17 and 18). 28.2. Suraj Bhan Meena v. State of Rajasthan [Suraj Bhan Meena v. State of Rajasthan, (2011) 1 SCC 467 : (2011) 1 SCC (L&S) 1] (two-Judge Bench) (see paras 10, 50, and 67). 28.3. U.P. Power Corpn. Ltd. v. Rajesh Kumar [U.P. Power Corpn. Ltd. v. Rajesh Kumar, (2012) 7 SCC 1 : (2012) 2 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1547 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. SCC (L&S) 289] (two-Judge Bench) [see paras 61, 81(ix), and 86]. 28.4. S. Panneer Selvam v. State of T.N. [S. Panneer Selvam v. State of T.N., (2015) 10 SCC 292 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 76] (two-Judge Bench) (see paras 18, 19, and 36). 28.5. Central Bank of India v. SC/ST Employees Welfare Assn. [Central Bank of India v. SC/ST Employees Welfare Assn., (2015) 12 SCC 308 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 355] (two-Judge Bench) (see paras 9 and 26). 28.6. Suresh Chand Gautam v. State of U.P. [Suresh Chand Gautam v. State of U.P., (2016) 11 SCC 113 : (2016) 2 SCC (L&S) 291] (two-Judge Bench) (see paras 2 and 45). 28.7. B.K. Pavitra v. Union of India [B.K. Pavitra v. Union of India, (2017) 4 SCC 620 : (2017) 2 SCC (L&S) 128] (two-Judge Bench) (see paras 17 to 22).” 167. The Court in unequivocal terms held that when a court applies the creamy layer principle to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, it does not in any manner tinker with the Presidential List under Articles 341 or 342 of the Constitution of India. It is observed that the caste or group or sub-group named in the said List continues exactly as before. It has been further observed that it is only those persons within that group or sub-group, who, on account of belonging to the creamy layer, have come out of untouchability or backwardness would be excluded from the benefit of reservation. 168. The Court observed that even if we assume that Articles 341 and 342 empower Parliament to exclude the creamy layer from the groups or sub-groups contained within the lists notified under Articles 341 and 342, constitutional courts, applying Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution would be entitled to exclude the creamy layer. It has been held that the Constitutional Courts, when applying the principle of reservation, will be well within their jurisdiction to exclude the creamy layer from such groups or sub-groups when applying the principles of equality under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
