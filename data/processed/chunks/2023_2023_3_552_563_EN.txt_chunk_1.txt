When the facts as they exist are taken into consideration, the continuation of this marriage would mean continuation of cruelty, which each one inflicts on D the other. Irretrievable breakdown of a marriage may not be a ground for dissolution of marriage, under the Hindu Marriage Act, but cruelty is. A marriage can be dissolved by a decree of divorce, inter alia, on the ground when the other party “has, after the solemnization of the marriage treated the petitioner with E cruelty”. A marital relationship which has only become more bitter and acrimonious over the years, does nothing but inflicts cruelty on both the sides. To keep the façade of this broken marriage alive would be doing injustice to both the parties. A marriage which has broken down irretrievably, spells cruelty to both the F parties, as in such a relationship each party is treating the other with cruelty. It is therefore a ground for dissolution of marriage under Section 13(1)(ia). [Para 16][560-D-G] 1.3 The matrimonial bond is completely broken and is beyond repair. This relationship must end as its continuation is G causing cruelty on both the sides. The long separation and absence of cohabitation and the complete breakdown of all meaningful bonds and the existing bitterness between the two, has to be read as cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of the 1955 Act. Therefore, in a given case, where the marital relationship has broken down H 554 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A irretrievably, where there is a long separation and absence of cohabitation (as in the instant case for the last 25 years), with multiple Court cases between the parties; then continuation of such a ‘marriage’ would only mean giving sanction to cruelty which each is inflicting on the other. A dissolution of this marriage would affect only the two parties as there is no child out of the wedlock. B [Para 18][562-C-E] 1.4 Under these circumstances, the of the trial court is upheld, though for different grounds given and the of the High Court is set aside and a decree of divorce is granted to the appellant/husband. Their marriage shall stand dissolved. However, C considering the fact that the appellant/husband is an employee in Life Insurance Corporation present salary is more than Rs.1,00,000/- (One Lakh Rupees) per month, it is deemed fit and proper that he gives an amount of Rs.30,00,000/- (Thirty Lakh Rupees) to the respondent/wife as permanent alimony.
