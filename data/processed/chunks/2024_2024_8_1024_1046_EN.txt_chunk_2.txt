1. The short issue arising from these appeals is whether the extension of the Scheduled Commissioning Date1 was occasioned under the force majeure clause of the Power Purchase Agreement,2 and consequently, whether the reduction in tariff payable to the respondents is justified. While upholding the decision of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity3 we have examined the scope and ambit of our appellate jurisdiction under Section 125 of the Electricity Act, 2003.4 We have held that the restrictive scope of appellate jurisdiction is a product not only of the statutory preconditions, but also a necessary measure to enable freedom to statutory regulator and Tribunal to develop sectorial laws through a principled and consistent approach. 2. Facts : Since the facts and the PPAs are similar in all three appeals, we will deal with the facts in the lead Civil Appeal No. 7595/2021, where the most relevant facts are as follows: * Ed.

Digital Supreme Court Reports 2.1 State of Karnataka introduced a policy dated 26.08.2014 to identify and promote solar energy projects by land-owning farmers. These solar power plants of 1-3 MW capacity would generate and sell power to the State Electricity (Distribution) Supply Companies5 at the tariff determined by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission.6 2.2 Respondent no. 2 is one of the many farmers who applied under the policy and is recognised as a solar power developer7 under the policy. Respondent No.1 is a special purpose vehicle to undertake the solar power project in Chitradurga district in Karnataka. 2.3 Pursuant to a Letter of Award dated 28.08.2015, the appellant entered into a PPA with respondent no. 2 on 29.08.2015. This PPA was approved by the KERC on 07.09.2015. The relevant clauses of the PPA will be discussed later, but an important aspect to note at this juncture is that the SPV must achieve commercial operation within 18 months from the effective date as per Article 1.1(xxviii) read with Article 4.1(c) of the PPA. Effective date is defined under Article 1.1(xii) as the date of signing the PPA. Hence, the SCD for the project was 28.02.2017 as per these clauses. 2.4 The SPV (respondent no. 1) was incorporated on 05.02.2016.
