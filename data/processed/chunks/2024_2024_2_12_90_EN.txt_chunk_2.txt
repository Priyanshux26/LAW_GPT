[Paras 117, 118, 119, 120] Doctrines/Principles – Principle of ‘Reading-Down’ a provision: Held: The principle of “reading down” a provision refers to a legal interpretation approach where a court, while examining the validity of a statute, attempts to give a narrowed or restricted meaning to a particular provision in to uphold its constitutionality – This principle is rooted in the idea that courts should make every effort to preserve the validity of legislation and should only declare a law invalid as a last resort – When a court encounters a provision that, if interpreted according to its plain and literal meaning, might lead to constitutional or legal issues, the court may opt to read down the provision –Reading down involves construing the language of the provision in a manner that limits its scope or application, making it consistent with constitutional or legal principles – The rationale [2024] 2 S.C.R. 15 The Authorised Officer, Central Bank of India v. Shanmugavelu behind the principle of reading down is to avoid striking down an entire legislation – Courts generally prefer to preserve the intent of the legislature and the overall validity of a law by adopting an interpretation that addresses the specific constitutional concerns without invalidating the entire statute. [Paras 93, 94, 95] Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 – Rule 9 sub-rule (5) – Harshness of a provision is no reason to read down the same: Held: Harshness of a provision is no reason to read down the same, if its plain meaning is unambiguous and perfectly valid – A law/rule should be beneficial in the sense that it should suppress the mischief and advance the remedy – The harsh consequence of forfeiture of the entire earnest-money deposit has been consciously incorporated by the legislature in Rule 9(5) of the SARFAESI Rules so as to sub-serve the larger object of the SARFAESI Act of timely resolving the bad debts of the country – The idea behind prescribing such a harsh consequence is not illusory, it is to attach a legal sanctity to an auction process once conducted under the SARFAESI Act from ultimately getting concluded – Any dilution of the forfeiture provided under Rule 9(5) of the SARFAESI Rules would result in the entire auction process under the SARFAESI Act being set at naught by mischievous auction purchaser(s) through sham bids, thereby undermining the overall object of the SARFAESI Act of promoting financial stability, reducing NPAs and fostering a more efficient and streamlined mechanism for recovery of bad debts.
