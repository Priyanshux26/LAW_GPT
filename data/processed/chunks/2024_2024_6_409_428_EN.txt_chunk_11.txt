27. The reasoning adopted by the High Court cannot be sustained in the light of aforestated discussion. This takes us to the consequential question, namely, whether at this distance of time, we ought to direct freezing of the bank accounts afresh? The answer has to be in the negative, since undisputedly by virtue of the impugned , the bank accounts of the respondents has been defreezed and resultantly, the Respondents would have operated the accounts and amount of Rs.19,83,036/- which had been frozen would have been withdrawn. The ends of justice would be met and the interest of prosecution would be served if the Respondents are called upon, forthwith, to execute a bond undertaking to deposit the amount (which has been thus far withdrawn from the seized bank accounts) before the jurisdictional Court in the event the Court were to return a finding of guilt against the accused persons. The Respondents would have to undertake to deposit the amount within four weeks from the date on which the Court passes an of conviction. It is needless to say that the bond executed would stand discharged if the accused persons are acquitted at the end of trial. 28. With these observations, appeals are allowed in part.
