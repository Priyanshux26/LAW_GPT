Section 2(d) thereof defi nes “co-operative society” to mean a co-operative society registered or deemed to be registered under the State Act, 1969 (21 of 1969). It is apposite to note that Section 2(iA) of the said Act defi nes “Rural Development” to mean any activity intended to promote the development in rural area and includes the following developmental activities: i) Development of handicrafts and other crafts; ii) Small Industries; iii) Cottage and Village Industries; iv) Industries in tiny and decentralized section; and v) Rural housing needs of the rural-population. 9. Having considered the evolution of the statutory framework that governs the appellant/assessee, it would be appropriate to briefl y state relevant facts giving rise to these appeals. 9.1. On 27.10.2007 the appellant/assessee fi led its Return of Income for the Assessment Year 2007-08 of Rs. 27,18,052 claiming deduction under KSCARDB v. THE ASSESSING OFFICER, TRIVANDRUM 325 AND ORS. [B.V. NAGARATHNA, J.] Section 80P (2)(a)(i) of the Act. Upon scrutiny, on 22.12.2009 an Assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act, was passed by the Assessing Offi cer for the Assessment Year 2007-08, disallowing the deduction of Rs. 36,39,87,058 under Section 80P(2)(a)(i) holding that the appellant/ assessee is neither a primary agricultural credit society nor a primary co- operative agricultural and rural development bank. The Assessing Offi cer held the appellant/assessee is a “co-operative bank” and thus, was hit by the provisions of Section 80(P)(4) and was not entitled to the benefi t of Section 80(P)(2) of the Act. The Assessing Offi cer observed that with eff ect from 01.04.2007, Section 80P was amended by the insertion of sub-section (4) as per which the provisions of Section 80P shall not apply to any co- operative bank other than a primary agricultural credit society or a primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank. The Assessing Offi cer declared the appellant/assessee to be neither a primary agricultural credit society nor a primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank, thus, the appellant/assessee’s claim was hit by Section 80P (4) of the Act. The total income was assessed at Rs. 36,69,47,233. 9.2. Aggrieved by the Assessment dated 27.12.2009, the appellant/assessee fi led an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) (“CIT(A)”). The CIT(A) vide dated 30.07.2010 confi rmed the disallowance made by the Assessing Offi cer. The CIT (A) was of the view that the appellant/assessee is actively playing the role of a development bank in the State and is no longer a land mortgage bank but is a development bank. The appellant/assessee may have earlier been a land mortgage bank but by virtue of a shift in its activities has become a development bank and is now governed by the State Act, 1984 and thus, it is in the business of banking as it satisfi es all the tests that are required to qualify as a “co-operative bank”. CIT (A) further observed that with the insertion of Section 80P (4), co-operative banks are placed at par with other commercial banks and the appellant/assessee who is in the business of banking through its primary co-operative banks is defi nitely a co-operative bank within the meaning of Section 80P (4).
