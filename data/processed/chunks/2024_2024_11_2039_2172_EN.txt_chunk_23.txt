This finally extended the time for achieving the Effective Date from 22.03.2022 to 25.05.2022 (3rd extension). 7.

As a consequence, Respondent No.1 had 180 days from 20.05.2022 i.e., until 16.11.2022 to infuse an amount of Rs. 350 Crore in the Corporate Debtor as per Clause 6.3.1(g) and the Implementation Schedule under Clause 7.7.1 of the Resolution Plan. 8.

However, it was observed that the workmen and employees are entitled to the payment of their full provident fund and gratuity which was unpaid as on the insolvency commencement date and that the balance of the above dues should be paid by the Successful Resolution Applicant i.e., Respondent No.1, in to satisfy its statutory obligations. It was further stated that 2078 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports “Non-payment of full PF and Gratuity shall lead to violation of Section 30(2)(e) and hence, to save the plan, the above payments have to be made”.

It is the case of Respondent No.1 that between May 2022 and October 2022, the Appellants disputed the fulfilment of the Conditions Precedent by Respondent No.1 on one ground or another. Therefore, on 18.10.2022, Respondent No.1 filed two Interim Applications – First, IA No. 3398 of 2022 (hereinafter, “Implementation Application”) before the NCLT seeking necessary directions for the implementation of the Resolution Plan and a declaration that all the Conditions Precedent have been fulfilled; Second, IA No. 3508 of 2022 requesting that the period from 20.05.2022 till the date on which the Implementation Application would be decided by the NCLT be excluded for the purpose of calculating 180 days from the Effective Date, for the purpose of making the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore. 10. The NCLT allowed both the aforesaid IAs and vide its common dated 13.01.2023 held that all the Conditions Precedent have been duly complied with and therefore, 20.05.2022 would be the Effective Date. Further, it excluded the period from 20.05.2022 to 16.11.2022 (180 days) from the period of 180 days within which the first tranche payment had to be made, in the interests of justice and to achieve the primary objective of maximization of assets and resolution of the Corporate Debtor. As a consequence, the deadline to meet with the first tranche payment obligation of Rs. 350 Crore was extended till 15.05.2023 (hereinafter, “1st implementation extension”). The appellants challenged this common dated 13.01.2023 passed by the NCLT before the NCLAT by way of Company Appeal (AT) (INS) Nos.
