[Paras 33-35, 37, 39, 48 and 49] Information Technology Act, 2000 – ss.67 – Penal Code, 1860 – s.292 – “obscenity” defined in s.292 and s.67 – Difference: Held: “Obscenity” has been similarly defined in s.292 and s.67 as material which is lascivious; or appeals to the prurient interest; or its effect tends to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it – However, the difference between them is only that s.67 is a special provision that applies [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1149 Apoorva Arora & Anr. Etc. v. State (Govt. of Nct of Delhi) & Anr. when the obscene material is published or transmitted in the electronic form – Since, in the present case, the alleged offending material is a web-series, the case is considered u/s.67, IT Act but the same test for obscenity as laid down u/s.292 will apply since the provisions are similarly worded in that respect. [Para 12] Penal Code, 1860 – s.292 – “Obscenity” – Material if obscene – Process and method to objectively judge – Discussed. Information Technology Act, 2000 – s.67A – ‘sexually explicit act or conduct’ – s.67A when not attracted: Held: Facts of the present case do not attract s.67A as the complainant’s grievance was about excessive usage of vulgar expletives, swear words, and profanities – There was no allegation of any ‘sexually explicit act or conduct’ in the complaint and as such, s.67A does not get attracted – High Court did not give any reason whatsoever on how s.67A was attracted to the facts of the present case – Offence of s.67A not made out. [Para 45, 46] Penal Code, 1860 – s.292 – “Obscenity” – Hicklin test; “Community Standard Test” – Discussed – Precedents on s.292 traced. Information Technology Act, 2000 – ss.67A, 67 – “explicit”, “act”, “conduct” – ‘obscenity’: Held: s.67A criminalises publication, transmission, causing to publish or transmit in electronic form any material that contains sexually explicit act or conduct – Though the three expressions “explicit”, “act”, and “conduct” are open-textured and are capable of encompassing wide meaning, the phrase may have to be seen in the context of ‘obscenity’ as provided in s.67 – Thus, there could be a connect between s.67A and s.67 itself – For example, there could be sexually explicit act or conduct which may not be lascivious – Equally, such act or conduct might not appeal to prurient interests – On the contrary, a sexually explicit act or conduct presented in an artistic or a devotional form may have exactly the opposite effect, rather than tending to deprave and corrupt a person.
