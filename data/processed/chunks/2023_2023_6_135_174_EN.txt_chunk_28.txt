The courts have also pointed out in these cases that what the Magistrate has to see is whether there is evidence in support of the allegations of the complainant and not whether the evidence is sufficient to B warrant a conviction. The learned Judges in some of these cases have been at pains to observe that an enquiry under Section 202 is not to be likened to a trial which can only take place after process is issued, and that there can be only one trial. No doubt, as stated in sub-section (1) of Section 202 C itself, the object of the enquiry is to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the complaint, but the Magistrate making the enquiry has to do this only with reference to the intrinsic quality of the statements made before him at the enquiry which would naturally mean the complaint itself, the statement on oath made by the complainant and the statements made before D him by persons examined at the instance of the complainant.” 33. Counsel for the accused, on the other hand, have highlighted the complainant’s conduct, which it is submitted, is contradictory to her explanation for the delay. She was/is not a timid person and an experienced social and political worker of standing. She has been continuously filing E FIRs. In an FIR filed on 31st August 2018, she had made allegations of rape against a third person who is a political worker in the same organisation. In a complaint filed on 12th December 2019, she had alleged that the accused had met her on four occasions in the last year and each time they had locked “me for 4 to 5 hours and pressurized me for F withdrawing the case”. The police after investigation on this complaint dated 12th December 2019 had filed an FIR No. 131 of 2019 dated 20th December 2019 and filed closure report dated 16th June 2020. As a matter of fact, the case has been closed. The complainant subsequently filed another complaint dated 6th February 2020, wherein there is no mention of that particular case of the alleged rape incident. Even in the G complaint filed on 12thMarch 2020 by the complainant, there was again no mention of the alleged rape. The complainant’s assertion in the counter affidavit that she had filed a police complaint in respect of the rape incident on 29th November 2018 by lodging a complaint the very next day at 11:00 a.m. at Behala (Women) Police Station has been denied by H the State of West Bengal, who have informed this Court that there is no KAILASH VIJAYVARGIYA v. RAJLAKSHMI CHAUDHURI 171 AND OTHERS [M. R. SHAH, J.] such record of the complaint being filed. The accused filed an application A on 4th October 2021 under the Right to Information Act, 2005 and have received on 22nd October 2021 copies of preliminary inquiries done by Police Station Bhawanipore dated 30th October 2020 and 5th November 2020. The preliminary inquiries conclude that in the communications made to the police between 2018 to 2020, there is no allegation that rape took B place on 29th November 2018.
