PARDIWALA, JJ.] Constitution of India – Power of Judicial review – Contractual/ C commercial matters – Held: Courts should exercise a lot of restraint while exercising Powers of judicial review in contractual or commercial matters – In contracts involving technical issues the courts should be even more reluctant – Courts must also not interfere where such interference will cause unnecessary loss to the public D exchequer – In the present case, TATA Motors deviated from the material and the essential term of the Tender – High Court having once declared TATA Motors as non-responsive and having stood disqualified from the Tender process should not have entered into the fray of investigating into the decision of BEST to declare EVEY as the eligible bidder – High Court was not exercising its writ E jurisdiction in public interest – It looked into a petition filed by a party trying to assert its own rights – Grant of judicial relief at the instance of a party which does not fulfil the requisite criteria is misplaced – BEST committed no error or cannot be held guilty of favoritism, etc. in allowing EVEY to submit a revised Annexure Y as F the earlier one was incorrect on account of a clerical error – This exercise itself was not sufficient to declare the entire bid offered by EVEY as unlawful or illegal – Writ court should refrain from imposing its decision over the decision of the employer as to whether or not to accept the bid of a tenderer unless something very gross or palpable is pointed out – Initiating a fresh tender process at this G stage may consume lot of time and also loss to the public exchequer – Part of the of the High Court by which the decision of BEST to accept the tender of EVEY was set aside and it was left to the discretion of BEST to undertake a fresh tender process, set aside.
