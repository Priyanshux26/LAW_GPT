The learned senior counsel further submitted that the Governor has since granted his recommendation for the introduction of two of the three Money Bills in the Vidhan Sabha. As we have held above, the Governor is not at liberty to withhold his action on the Bills which have been placed before him. He has no avenue but to act in a manner postulated under Article 200. Regardless, these submissions do not aff ect the role of the Governor 8 Article 168. Constitution of Legislatures in States. - (1) For every State there shall be a Legislature which shall consist of the Governor, and (a) - [Andhra Pradesh], [***], Bihar, [***] [Madhya Pradesh], [***[, [Maharashtra], [Karnataka] [***], [Tamil Nadu] [and Uttar Pradesh], two Houses; (b) in other States, one House. (2) Where there are two Houses of the Legislature of a State, one shall be known as the Legislative Council and the other as the Legislative Assembly, and where there is only one House, it shall be known as the Legislative Assembly 794 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. under the Constitution or justify the inaction on the Bills sent to him by a democratically elected State Legislature. 28. In view of the above, the Governor of Punjab was not empowered to withhold action on the Bills passed by the State Legislature and must act “as soon as possible”. In any event, as delineated below, it was legally permissible for the Speaker to reconvene the Vidhan Sabha because (a) there is a distinction between adjournment and prorogation; and (b) the Speaker has exclusive jurisdiction over regulating the procedure of the House. B. Reconvening a sitting of the Vidhan Sabha which has not been prorogued is permissible in law and is within the exclusive domain of the Speaker 1. Distinction between adjournment and prorogation 29. Article 174 of the Constitution provides that the Governor shall from time to time summon the House or each House of the legislature of the State to meet at such time and place as he thinks fi t. However, clause (1) also specifi es that six months shall not intervene between the last sitting in one session and the date appointed for the fi rst sitting in the next session. Clause (2) of Article 174 empowers the Governor, from time to time to (a) prorogue the House or either House of the legislature; and (b) dissolve the Legislative Assembly. Article 174 thus makes a reference to distinct constitutional concepts, namely, the power to prorogue and the power to dissolve. 30. Signifi cantly, Article 174 also makes a distinction between a sitting of the legislature and a session of the legislature. That is how, while specifying the maximum duration between two sittings, Article 174(1) stipulates that not more than six months should elapse between the last sitting of the legislature in one session and the date appointed for its fi rst sitting in the next session. This implicitly recognizes that there may be more than one sitting of the legislature comprised in one session.
