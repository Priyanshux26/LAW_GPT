Gabrial Babu and others (1991) 188 ITR 464 Kerala and Dhanush General Stores v. Commissioner of Income Tax (2011) G 339 ITR 651 Chhattisgarh – referred to. HELD: (Per Hrishikesh Roy, J.) (Concurring): 1. If all sundry articles of nominal value are bracketed in the category of valuable article, it will lead to an absurdity and will also be inconsistent with the legislative intent. Focusing on H 538 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A the high total value of an article, ignoring its lowly per unit price would mean including low-cost ordinary articles also in the valuable category, under Section 69A. This would defy the legislature’s logic. In this context, when the principle of Ejusdem Generis is applied, the preceding words in Section 69A such as money, bullion, jewellery would suggest that the phrase ‘other B valuable article’ which follows those words, would justify inclusion of only high value goods. Any other way of reading the phrase ‘other valuable article’ or ‘valuable article’ by ignoring the kind of specific goods mentioned in the preceding part of Section 69A, would be incorrect and would do violence to the plain language C of the provision and will travel beyond the legislative intent. Additionally, the maxim ‘noscitur a sociis’ i.e. (a word is known by its associates) would also support the above view that the other valuable articles should be items in the nature of silver bars, or jewellery or money i.e. only high priced item. [Paras 10 & 11][594- G-H; 595-A-B] D 2. For purposes of interpreting Section 69A of the Income Tax, Act 1961- the ordinary and literal meaning should be opted as the words in the statute are clear and unambiguous. The provision does not need any addition or subtraction and stands on its own legs. The phrase ‘valuable article’ would simply mean E an item ‘worth a great deal of money’. It cannot mean, as is said in the impugned , to include ‘any article of value’. In the context of Section 69A, unexplained valuable article has to be high priced item which are procured to hide income, to avoid tax liability. To adopt a wide interpretation for the phrase- ‘valuable F article’ and thereby include within its scope any sundry article of whatever value, is found to be unjustified. It needs to be also reiterated that, ordinarily, fiscal laws including taxation statutes, are to be strictly interpreted and tax must not be imposed through analogy, inference or by extension of phrases used by the legislature. [Para 15][596-E-G] G 3. Bitumen is not a valuable article in the context of Section 69A and the assessee here was not the owner of the concerned bitumen for the purpose of section 69A of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
