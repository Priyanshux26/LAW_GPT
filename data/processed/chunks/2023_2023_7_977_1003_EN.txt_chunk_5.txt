The E learned Tribunal has also observed that it is clear from the provisions of sub-section 4 of Section 67 of the Act, that where value cannot be determined as provided under sub-rule (1) to (3) of Section 67 of the Act, then only the value is to be determined as provided under the Rules. Therefore, the Tribunal held that there is no question on applicability of Rule 2A nor there was any question of forcibly applying the option of F Composition Scheme. The learned Tribunal held that in both these circumstances, the respondent was entitled to CENVAT Credit on inputs. 2.9 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned and passed by the learned Tribunal setting aside the -in- Original, the Revenue has preferred the present appeal.
