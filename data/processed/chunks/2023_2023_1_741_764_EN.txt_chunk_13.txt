But a deemed bail under Chapter XXXIII, under the thrust of Section 167(2), as is discernible, appears to me on a different footing, permitting cancellation of bail not only on the well-known grounds for cancellation of bail but also on the special singular ground on the Court’s entertaining the view that there are sufficient H THE STATE THROUGH CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION V. T. 757 GANGI REDDY @ YERRA GANGI REDDY [M. R. SHAH, J.] grounds that the accused had committed a non-bailable offence A and that it was necessary that he should be arrested and committed to custody. The seeming diversity in Bashir case [(1977) 4 SCC 410] crops up only if it is understood that it takes a bail under Section 167(2), as if an on merit under sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 437. But if the fiction, as it appears to me, B extends to the extent of the bail being treated as if passed under Chapter XXXIII and that too under sub- sections (1) and (2) of Section 437 read with the provisions of Section 167(2) as part and parcel of that chapter so that the bail remains an passed on default and not on merit, the tangency disappears. And even if this aspect is ignored, Bashir case [(1977) 4 SCC C 410] goes on to add a singular and special ground for cancellation of bail granted under Section 167(2) over and above the other well-known grounds for cancellation of bail granted under sub- sections (1) and (2) of Section 437 of the Code. The provision employable in that event again is Section 437(5) of the Code, D notwithstanding the text of the provision, for besides that there is no other provision with the Court. 26. The existence of such special ground for cancellation of bail, over and above the well-known grounds for cancellation of bail, granted under Section 167(2) of the Code was re-affirmed E and repeated in a decision of this Court by a two-member Bench in Raghubir Singh v. State of Bihar [(1986) 4 SCC 481] at page 826 by stating as follows: (SCC p. 502, para 22) “Where bail has been granted under the proviso to Section 167(2) for the default of the prosecution in not completing F the investigation in 60 days, after the defect is cured by the filing of a charge-sheet, the prosecution may seek to have the bail cancelled on the ground that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accused has committed a non- bailable offence and that it is necessary to arrest him and commit him to custody. In the last mentioned case, one would G expect very strong grounds indeed.” The strong grounds referred in the context obviously are grounds on merits of the case, which are reflective from the formal accusation put in the challan which the accused has to face at the trial. H 758 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 27. Raghubir Singh case [(1986) 4 SCC 481] was followed by a decision of a vacation Judge of this Court in Rajnikant Jivanlal Patel v. Intelligence Officer, NCB, New Delhi [(1989) 3 SCC 532].
