v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. 96. The law laid down by this Court is binding on subsequent benches of lesser or coequal strength. A bench of lesser strength cannot disagree or dissent from the view taken by a bench of a larger quorum. In case of any doubt, such a bench may only invite the attention of the Chief Justice and request for the matter to be placed for hearing before a bench of a larger strength than the quorum of the bench whose decision was being considered. A bench of coequal strength may go one step ahead, and express an opinion doubting the correctness of the view taken by the earlier bench of coequal strength. Subsequently, the matter may be placed before a larger bench to lay down the law on the correctness of the decision which is doubted.96 97. Judges of this Court have the liberty to pronounce separate dissenting (s). However, it is the decision of the majority of judges which constitutes the binding .97The binding nature of the judgement depends on the bench strength and not the numerical strength of the majority taking a particular view. For instance, if a is pronounced by a bench of seven judges, with four judges constituting the majority, and the remaining three judges dissenting from the view of the majority, the majority judgement will constitute a binding by a bench of seven judges and not a bench of four judges. This position of law has been clarified and settled by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Trimurthi Fragrances (P) Ltd. v. State (NCT of Delhi).98 98.
