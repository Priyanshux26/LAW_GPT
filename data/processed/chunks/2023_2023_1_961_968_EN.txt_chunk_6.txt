Under the circumstances also, the Division Bench of the High Court has committed a very serious error in interfering with the D of penalty of dismissal imposed and ing reinstatement of the respondent. 6.4 At this stage, it is required to be observed that even while holding that the punishment/penalty of dismissal disproportionate to the gravity of the wrong, thereafter, no further punishment/penalty is imposed E by the Division Bench of the High Court except denial of back wages. As per the settled position of law, even in a case where the punishment is found to be disproportionate to the misconduct committed and proved the matter is to be remitted to the disciplinary authority for imposing appropriate punishment/penalty which as such is the prerogative of the disciplinary authority. On this ground also, the impugned and F passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is unsustainable. As observed hereinabove as the of penalty/punishment cannot be said to be disproportionate, there is no question of remanding the matter back to the disciplinary authority. 7. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above the G present appeal succeeds. The impugned and passed by the High Court setting aside the of penalty of dismissal and reinstating the respondent is hereby quashed and set aside. No costs. Ankit Gyan Appeal allowed.
