However, the exercise of such power under Article 161 of the Constitution or under Section 433-A CrPC may have a diff erent fl avour in the statutory provisions, as short-sentencing policy brings about a mere reduction in the period of imprisonment whereas an act of clemency under Article 161 of the Constitution commutes the sentence itself.” 10. That this executive power which is inherently discretionary in nature, has to be exercised fairly, reasonably, and not arbitrarily, has been held by this court in numerous cases.8 Absence to do so, would - like is the 7 [2010] 3 SCR 716 [hereafter referred to as ‘Jagdish’] 8 State of Haryana v. Mohinder Singh [2000] 1 SCR 698; Sangeet v. State of Hary- ana[2012] 13 SCR 85; Union of India v. V. Sriharan[2015] 14 SCR 613; Rajan v. The Home Secretary, Home Department of Tamil Nadu [2019] 6 SCR 1035; Ram Chander v. State of Chhattisgarh [2022] 4 SCR 1103. RAJO @ RAJWA @ RAJENDRA MANDAL v. THE STATE 493 OF BIHAR & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] case for other executive action- compel the court to exercise its judicial review, and in appropriate cases remit the matter for reconsideration.9 The procedure laid out in Section 432(2), has been held to be mandatory by a fi ve-judge bench of this court, in Union of India v. V. Sriharan10. The court also observed how the said procedure operated as a safeguard, much like the ones provided under Article 72 and 161 of the Constitution: “141. […] Therefore, when in the course of exercise of larger constitutional powers of similar kind under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution it has been opined by this Court to be exercised with great care and caution, the one exercisable under a statute, namely, under Section 432(1)CrPC which is lesser in degree should necessarily be held to be exercisable in tune with the adjunct provision contained in the same section. Viewed in that respect, we fi nd that the procedure to be followed whenever any application for remission is moved, the safeguard provided under Section 432(2)CrPC should be the sine qua non for the ultimate power to be exercised under Section 432(1)CrPC. 142. By following the said procedure prescribed under Section 432(2), the action of the appropriate Government is bound to survive and stand the scrutiny of all concerned, including the judicial forum. It must be remembered, barring minor off ences, in cases involving heinous crimes like, murder, kidnapping, rape, robbery, dacoity, etc. and such other off ences of such magnitude, the verdict of the trial court is invariably dealt with and considered by the High Court and in many cases by the Supreme Court. Thus, having regard to the nature of opinion to be rendered by the Presiding Offi cer of the court concerned will throw much light on the nature of crime committed, the record of the convict himself, his background and other relevant factors which will enable the appropriate Government to take the right decision as to whether or not suspension or remission of sentence should be granted.
