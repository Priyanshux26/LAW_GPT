Section 6A, as it was added in 1985 to the Citizenship Act reads as follows: “6A. Special provisions as to citizenship of persons covered by the Assam Accord – (1) For the purposes of this section 28 We are also apprised of the fact that Parliament has promulgated the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, and more recently on 11.03.2024 the Government of India has notified the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024. However, we are not dealing with these provisions given that neither of the parties relied upon these provisions over the course of the proceedings before us. Additionally, some of these provisions had not yet been notified as of the date of reserving these s. In any case, these provisions are not germane to the controversy at hand, and a challenge to these amendments is already sub-judice before another bench of this Court.
