In that view of the matter, we fi nd that the High Court was not justifi ed in imposing death penalty on appellant Madan while converting the death penalty imposed upon Sudesh Pal to life imprisonment. If the of the High Court is maintained, it would lead to an anomalous situation. Whereas appellant Sudesh Pal would be entitled for consideration of his case for remission and pre-mature release on completion of a particular number of years in accordance with the relevant rules, appellant Madan will have to face death penalty. 77. We are of the considered view that the present case would fall in the middle path as laid down in the case of Swamy Shraddananda (2) alias Murali Manohar Mishra (supra), followed by this Court in various s. We fi nd that the interest of justice would be met by converting 812 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. death penalty into life imprisonment i.e. actual imprisonment for a period of 20 years without remission. 78. In the result, the appeals are disposed with the following directions: (i) Criminal Appeal No.1790 of 2017 fi led by appellant Sudesh Pal is dismissed; (ii) Criminal Appeal Nos. 1381-1382 of 2017 fi led by appellant Madan are partly allowed. Conviction under Section 302 of IPC is confi rmed insofar as appellant Madan is concerned. However, death penalty imposed on him is converted into imprisonment for a fi xed term of 20 years, including the period already undergone, without remission; (iii) In other words, the case of appellant Madan would not be considered for pre-mature release unless he completes the actual sentence of 20 years. 79. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of in the above terms. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals disposed of. Ankit Gyan
