[Paras 212, 214, 217] Suggestions by Court – Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – Suggestions made to Ministry of Women and Child Development, Union of India: [2024] 10 S.C.R. 165 Just Rights for Children Alliance & Anr. v. S. Harish & Ors. Held: The term “child pornography” is a misnomer that fails to capture the full extent of the crime – Each case of what is traditionally termed “child pornography” involves the actual abuse of a child, the use of the term “child pornography” trivializes the crime, as pornography is often seen as a consensual act between adults – It undermines the victimization because the term suggests a correlation to pornography- conduct that may be legal, whose subject is voluntarily participating in, and whose subject is capable of consenting to the conduct – The term “child sexual exploitation and abuse material”(“CSEAM”) more accurately reflects the reality that these images and videos are not merely pornographic but are records of incidents, where a child has either been sexually exploited and abused or where any abuse of children has been portrayed through any self-generated visual depiction – CSEAM rightly places the emphasis on the exploitation and abuse of the child, highlighting the criminal nature of the act and the need for a serious and robust response – Courts forbidden from using the term “child pornography” and instead the term CSEAM should be used in judicial s and judgements of all courts across the country – Parliament should consider to amend the POCSO for substituting the term “child pornography” with “child sexual exploitation and abuse material” (CSEAM) – Further, though, there is a tangible difference between the act of viewing CSEAM and the act of engaging in sexual abuse of children, yet the latter desire is always inherent in the former – Need for and importance of positive age-appropriate sex education emphasized – Implementation of comprehensive sex education programs – Impact of CSEAM on victims; need for legal, social, therapeutic support to the victims and rehabilitation programs for the offenders, stated – These services should include psychological counselling, therapeutic interventions and educational support to address the underlying issues and promote healthy development – For those involved in viewing or distributing child pornography, CBT has proven effective in addressing the cognitive distortions that fuel such behaviour – Raising awareness about the realities of child sexual exploitative material and its consequences through public campaigns can help reduce its prevalence – Identifying at-risk individuals early and implementing intervention strategies for youth with problematic sexual behaviours (PSB) involves several steps and requires a coordinated effort among various stakeholders, including schools, educators, healthcare providers, law enforcement, and child welfare services – Union of India may consider constituting an Expert 166 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Committee for devising a comprehensive program or mechanism for health and sex education, as well as raising awareness about the POCSO among children – Obligation of the appropriate government and the commission under Section(s) 43 and 44 of the POCSO does not end at just spreading awareness about the provisions of the POCSO – Their efforts must go beyond just the textual wording of the said provisions and to earnestly take into account the pragmatic necessities for curtailing the issue of child abuse, exploitation and addiction to pornography – Collective responsibility of the society u/s.19, 20 of the POCSO, specified – Parliament to consider amending Section 15(1) of POCSO to make it more convenient for the general public to report by way of an online portal, any instance of storage or possession of CSEAM to the specified authorities for the purpose of the said provision.
