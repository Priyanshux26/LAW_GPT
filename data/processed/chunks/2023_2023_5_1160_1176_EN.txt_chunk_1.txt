The dated 21 October 2022 was subsequently withdrawn on 24 December 2022. The dated 24 December 2022 now clarifies D that limitation would be computed with effect from the date of e- filing but a physical copy would have to be filed within seven days of e-filing. [Para 22][1172-C-D] 1.2 In the instant case, the was pronounced by the NCLT on 26 August 2022. Rule 3 of the NCLAT Rules 2016 E stipulates that the date from which the period of limitation has to be reckoned (i.e., the date of the pronouncement of the ) would have to be excluded. Hence, the date on which the was pronounced by the NCLT, namely 26 August 2022 would have to be excluded from the computation of limitation. This is in line with Section 12(1) of the Limitation Act 1963. The provisions of F the Limitation Act 1963 are made applicable, inter alia, to appeals before the NCLAT by virtue of Section 238A of the IBC. [Para 23][1172-E-F] 1.3 Between 26 August 2022, when the was pronounced by the NCLT, and 10 October 2022, when the appeal G was e-filed, a period of 45 days elapsed after excluding the date on which the was pronounced. The NCLAT erroneously proceeded on the basis that the appeal was lodged on the 46th day whereas correctly computed, the appeal was lodged on the 45th day. The power of condoning a delay of up to 15 days beyond the original period of 30 days lies within the discretionary power H 1162 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A of the NCLAT. The appeal was instituted within the outer limit of 45 days. [Paras 24, 25][1172-H; 1173-A, C-D] 1.4 In the instant case, the application for a certified copy was sent from Delhi to Chennai on 2.09.2022, which was received on 5.09.2022, within the period of limitation of 30 days specified B in Section 61(2). This aspect lies in contrast to the facts as they obtained before this Court in the in VNagarajan’s case where even the application for obtaining the certified copy was not filed. In the instant case, the appellant exercised due diligence and applied for a certified copy upon pronouncement of the in terms of Rule 22(2) of the NLCAT Rules 2016. The certified C copy was provided to the appellant on 15.09.2022. Hence, the period of 10 days between 5.09.2022 and 15.09.2022 taken by the court to provide a certified copy of the ought to be excluded when determining the period of limitation under Section 61(2) of the IBC. Thus, the NCLAT was in error in dismissing D the appeal on the ground of limitation. The explanation which was advanced by the appellant for condoning the period of 5 days (beyond the period of 30 days stipulated for the filing of an appeal) was, sufficient and the delay should have been condoned within the four corners of the statute. The of the NCLAT is set aside. [Paras 28, 29, 32][1175-C-G; 1176-F] E 2. The Court cannot but fail to notice the flip-flops on the part of the NCLAT in providing administrative guidance on whether limitation would commence from the date of e-filing or from the presentation of the appeal at the filing counter.
