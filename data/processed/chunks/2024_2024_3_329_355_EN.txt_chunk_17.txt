40. Sounding a note of caution, this Court in State of West Bengal versus Orilal Jaiswal6 observed that the court should be extremely careful in assessing the facts and circumstances of each case as well as the evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose of finding whether the cruelty meted out to the victim had in fact induced her to end her life by committing suicide. If it transpires to the court that the victim committing suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences in domestic life quite common to the society to which the victim belonged and such petulance, discord and differences were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced individual to 6 [1993] Supp. 2 SCR 461 : (1994) 1 SCC 73 352 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports commit suicide, the conscience of the court should not be satisfied for basing a finding that the accused charged of abetting the offence of suicide should be found guilty. Non-recovery of trace of poison (pesticide) 41. There is one more aspect in this case. In a case of death due to consumption or administering of poison or insecticide or pesticide, be it homicidal or suicidal, recovery of the trace of such poison or insecticide or pesticide is crucial. 42. The post-mortem examination report indicated multiple injection marks over the front of both the elbows of the deceased. That apart, it was also noticed that there was a superficial linear incised injury measuring 5cms in length in the front of the right wrist which was partially healed. The stomach, small intestine and contents, liver, kidney and blood were preserved. Those were sealed and sent for chemical analysis to FSL, Bangalore on 07.07.2000. The chemical analysis report is dated 10.10.2000. The report dated 10.10.2000 stated that colour test for TLC method was carried out which responded to the presence of Organophosphate pesticide in stomach, small intestine, liver, kidney and blood. On this basis, the doctor who carried out the post-mortem examination i.e. PW-13 gave the final opinion that death of the deceased was due to respiratory failure as a result of consumption of substance containing Organophosphate compound. 43. Before proceeding further, it needs to be noted that the chemical analysis report is dated 10.10.2000 whereas the final opinion of PW-13 is dated 09.01.2001, there being a delay of three months. Ofcourse, PW-13 stated that he received the report only on 09.01.2001 on which date he gave the final opinion. Investigating officer offered no explanation as to why there was such delay in handing over of the chemical analysis report to PW-13. 44. Be that as it may, PW-13 in his deposition also stated about multiple injection marks being present over front of both the elbows besides the partially healed wrist wound on the body of the deceased. He stated that it was only on 09.01.2000 that he had received the chemical analysis report dated 10.10.2000 which showed presence of Organophosphate compound in the viscera. In his cross-examination, he explained that Organophosphate compound is a pesticide.
