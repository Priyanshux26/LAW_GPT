Similarly, the wound certificate of PW1 corroborated his account of the injuries he sustained during the attack. The Trial Court observed that the injuries detailed in the medical reports aligned with the testimonies of PW1 and PW2, reinforcing the prosecution’s case. 14. The defense attempted to argue that the incident occurred in the exercise of private defense, claiming that the accused were attacked by CPI(M) workers, including the deceased and PW1.

The injuries on appellant, documented in the wound certificate, were deemed minor and inconsistent with the defense’s narrative of a large-scale attack. The Court concluded that the accused were the aggressors and were not entitled to claim the right of private defense. 15.

When the deceased tried to flee, appellant – accused no. 1 drew the knife and inflicted a stab wound to his back. As PW-1 intervened to protect the deceased, appellant–turned on him, stabbing him in the buttock. This act of aggression was corroborated by medical evidence, which indicated that PW-1 sustained injuries consistent with the use of the weapon recovered during the investigation. Despite PW-1’s injuries, appellant resumed his attack on the deceased, stabbing him multiple times in the chest and other vital areas. 18. The High Court emphasized the significance of the post-mortem report, which revealed eight incised wounds on the deceased, including fatal injuries to the chest, heart, and lungs.
