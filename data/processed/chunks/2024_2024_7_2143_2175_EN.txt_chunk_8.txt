He pointed out that in the information memorandum of ACIL, the assets and liabilities of the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor were not included. The assets of the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor cannot be treated as a part of ACIL’s assets. He submitted that the resolution plan of ACIL has been prepared based on the information memorandum. 12 [2021] 2 SCR 924 : (2021) 8 SCC 481 13 [1970] 2 SCR 462 : (1970) 1 SCC 60 14 [2018] 10 SCR 974 : (2018) 17 SCC 394 15 (1927) SCC Online ALL 121 2154 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports He submitted that the information memorandum and the resolution plan must be consistent with Section 36(4)(d) of the IBC. REPLY OF THE APPELLANT 11. Replying to the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent-financial creditor, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant reiterated his submissions on the applicability of Section 140 of the Contract Act. His submission is that the information memorandum indicates taking over the business of ACIL and the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor. He submitted that the business of the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor was included in the insolvency plan. He submitted that by the admission of an application under Section 7 against the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor, a valuable asset of ACIL has been taken away. CONSIDERATION 12. Before we deal with the submissions canvassed across the Bar, we must note the issues formulated in the impugned of the NCLAT. Based on the submissions made before it, two issues were framed, which read thus: “13. Following issues arise in this appeal for our consideration: (i) Whether the application under Section 7 of IBC is barred by limitation? (ii) Whether the second Application under Section 7 of IBC is not maintainable against the Corporate Debtor as for the same debt and default, CIRP has already been taken place against the Corporate Guarantor and the Financial Creditor has accepted the amount in full and final settlement of all its dues?” 13. The present appellant did not canvas the issue of subrogation before the NCLAT. It is also not urged in the memorandum of appeal before the NCLAT. We may note here that the appellant has not seriously pressed the issue of the bar of limitation in this appeal. The NCLAT rendered the findings on both issues in favour of the respondents. There is no dispute that the 1st respondent financial creditor had granted a loan of Rs.100 crores to the 2nd respondent corporate debtor. The loan was secured by the corporate guarantee furnished [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2155 BRS Ventures Investments Ltd. v. SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd. & Anr. by ACIL, which is the holding company of the corporate debtor. There is no dispute that the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor committed a default in payment of the loan amount. Therefore, the guarantee was invoked by the 1st respondent-financial creditor, which led to the filing of an application under Section 7 of the IBC against ACIL. The CIRP of ACIL was completed, and the resolution plan was approved.
