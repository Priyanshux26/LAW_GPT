UNION OF 573 INDIA & ORS. [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 4. The Motor Vehicles Act 19881 was amended by Amending Act A 32 of 2019, inter alia, to comprehend aggregators within the scope of its regulatory provisions. The expression “aggregator” has been defined in Section 2(1A) to mean a digital intermediary or market place for a passenger to connect with a driver for the purpose of transportation. Section 93 forms a part of Chapter V which deals with the control of B transport vehicles. Section 93 was also amended in 2019 to cover aggregators. Section 93, as amended, reads thus: “93. Agent or canvasser or aggregator to obtain licence.- (1) No person shall engage himself- C (i) as an agent or a canvasser, in the sale of tickets for travel by public service vehicles or in otherwise soliciting custom for such vehicles, or (ii) as an agent in the business of collecting, forwarding or distributing goods carried by goods carriages, D (iii) as an aggregator, unless he has obtained a licence from such authority and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the State Government. Provided that while issuing the licence to an aggregator the E State Government may follow such guidelines as may be issued by the Central Government: Provided further that every aggregator shall comply with the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000) and the rules and regulations made there under.” F 5. The effect of the amended provision is that no person can act as an aggregator without a licence. The licence is to be “from such authority and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the State Government”. In terms of the first proviso to Section 93(1), the State Government, while issuing a licence to an aggregator, “may follow” G the guidelines issued by the Central Government. Section 96 confers a rule making power on the State Government for implementing the provisions of Chapter V. 1 “Act” H 574 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R.
