Assuming, therefore, that there is a clash between Section 14 IBC and the first proviso of Section 32-A(1), this clash is best C resolved by applying the doctrine of harmonious construction so that the objects of both the provisions get subserved in the process, without damaging or limiting one provision at the expense of the other. If, therefore, the expression “prosecution” in the first proviso of Section 32-A(1) refers to D criminal proceedings properly so-called either through the medium of a first information report or complaint filed by an investigating authority or complaint and not to quasi-criminal proceedings that are instituted under Sections 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the corporate debtor, the object of Section 14(1) IBC gets subserved, as does the object E of Section 32-A, which does away with criminal prosecutions in all cases against the corporate debtor, thus absolving the corporate debtor from the same after a new management comes in.” (Emphasis applied) F Thus, the heart of the matter is the second proviso appended to Section 32A(1)(b) of the IBC which provides statutory recognition of the criminal liability of the persons who are otherwise vicariously liable under Section 141 of NI Act, in the context of Section 138 offence. G 46. Thus, Section 32A broadly leads to: a. Extinguishment of the criminal liability of the corporate debtor, if the control of the corporate debtor goes in the hands of the new management which is different from the original old management. H 1030 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A b. The prosecution in relation to “every person who was a “designated partner” as defined in clause (j) of Section 2 of the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 (6 of 2009), or an “officer who is in default”, as defined in clause (60) of Section 2 of the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013), or was in any manner in charge of, or B responsible to the corporate debtor for the conduct of its business or associated with the corporate debtor in any manner and who was directly or indirectly involved in the commission of such offence”shall be proceeded and the law will take it’s own course. Only the corporate debtor C (with new management) as held in Para 42 of P. Mohanraj will be safeguarded. c. If the old management takes over the corporate debtor (for MSME Section 29A does not apply (see 240A), hence for MSME old management can takeover) the D corporate debtor itself is also not safeguarded from prosecution under Section 138 or any other offences. 47. Thus, I am of the view that by operation of the provisions of the IBC, the criminal prosecution initiated against the natural persons under Section 138 read with 141 of the NI Act read with Section 200 of E the CrPC would not stand terminated. 48. In JIK Industries Limited and Others v. Amarlal V. Jumani and Another reported in(2012) 3 SCC 255, this Court held that the sanction of a scheme under Section 391 of the Companies Act, 1956 will not lead to any automatic compounding of offence under Section 138 of F the NI Act without the consent of the complainant.
