Article 265 of the Constitution provides that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law. A taxing statute must be valid and conform to other provisions of the Constitution.34 22. Article 265 makes a distinction between “levy” and “collection.” The expression “levy” has a wider connotation. It includes both the imposition of a tax as well as assessment.35 The quantum of tax levied by a taxing statute, the conditions subject to which it is levied, and how it is sought to be recovered are all matters within the competence of the legislature.36In a taxing statute, the charging 31 Jindal Stainless Ltd v.

Rajeev Bansal provisions are generally accompanied by a set of provisions for computing or assessing the levy. The character of assessment provisions bears a relationship to the nature of the charge.37 23. Thomas Cooley describes assessment as the most important of all the proceedings in taxation. He further describes the necessity of assessment thus: “An assessment, when taxes are to be levied upon a valuation, is obviously indispensable. It is required as the first step in the proceedings against individual subjects of taxation, and is the foundation of all which follow it. Without an assessment they have no support, and are nullities. The assessment is, therefore, the most important of all the proceedings in taxation, and the provisions to insure its accomplishing its office are commonly very full and particular. If there is no valid assessment, a tax on sale of lands is a nullity. A want of assessment is not a mere irregularity remedied by a curative statute. On the other hand, no assessment is necessary where the statute itself prescribes the amount to be paid, and this can be recovered by suit. For instance, where a statute imposes a tax at a specified rate upon bank deposits, no other assessment other than that made by the statute itself is necessary.”38 24. The expression “assessment” comprehends the entire procedure for ascertaining and imposing liability upon taxpayers.39 The process of assessment involves computation of the income of the assessees, determination of tax payable by them, and the procedure for collecting or recovering tax.40 An assessing officer is concerned with the assessment and collection of revenue.
