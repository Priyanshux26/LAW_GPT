i) Further, the petitioner in Writ Petition (Crl.) No.491 of 2022 not being a party to the said writ proceeding, the same is not binding on her and she is entitled in law to question the s of remission dated 10.08.2022 from all angles including the correctness of the dated 13.05.2022. ii) In addition to the above, the said , being contrary to the larger bench decisions of this Court,(holding that it is the Government of the State within which the offender is sentenced which is the appropriate Government which can consider an application seeking remission of a sentence) is per incuriam and is not a binding precedent. Hence, the impugned s of remission dated 10.08.2022 are quashed on the above grounds. e) Without prejudice to the aforesaid conclusions, we further hold that the impugned s of remission dated 10.08.2022 passed by the respondent-State of Gujarat in favour of respondent Nos.3 to 13 are not in accordance with law for the following reasons: 902 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports i) That the Government of the State of Gujarat had usurped the powers of the State of Maharashtra which only could have considered the applications seeking remission. Hence, the doctrine of usurpation of powers applies in the instant case. ii) Consequently, the Policy dated 09.07.1992 of the State of Gujarat was not applicable to the case of respondent Nos. 3 to 13 herein. iii) That opinion of the Presiding Judge of the Court before which the conviction of respondent Nos.3 to 13 was made in the instant case i.e. Special Court, Mumbai (Maharashtra) was rendered ineffective by the Government of the State of Gujarat which in any case had no jurisdiction to entertain the plea for remission of respondent Nos.3 to 13 herein. The opinion of the Sessions Judge at Dahod was wholly without jurisdiction as the same was in breach of sub- section (2) of the Section 432 of the CrPC. iv) That while considering the applications seeking remission, the Jail Advisory Committee, Dahod and the other authorities had lost sight of the fact that respondent Nos.3 to 13 herein had not yet paid the fine ed by the Special Court, Mumbai which had been confirmed by the Bombay High Court. Ignoring this relevant consideration also vitiated exercise of discretion in the instant case. 56.1. Having declared and held as such, we now move to point No.5. Point No.5: What ? 57. Respondent Nos.4 to 13, who had made applications to the first respondent-State of Gujarat seeking remission of their sentences, have been granted remission by the impugned s dated 10.08.2022, while it is not known whether respondent No.3 had made any application to seek remission to the State of Gujarat as the same is not adverted to in the counter affidavit. The application seeking remission by respondent No. 3 before the State of Gujarat has not been brought on record as he had filed his application before the State of Maharashtra. Respondent Nos. 3 to 13 have been released pursuant to the s of remission dated 10.08.2022 and [2024] 1 S.C.R.
