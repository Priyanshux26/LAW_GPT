which must be made in priority over the dues of the other creditors were also not made – More than 5 years have passed and the implementation of the Resolution Plan still seems to be a dim light at the far end of a long tunnel – Over this period of 5 years, several dues such as the Airport dues to be paid by the Corporate Debtor have increased multi-fold due to the fault of the SRA and this Court must ensure that such debts stop running at some point in time. [Para 147] 3.4 Although one of the key objectives of the IBC, 2016 is to ensure the survival of the corporate debtor as a going concern, yet the same must not come at the cost of efficiency – In scenarios such as the present, “timely liquidation” is indeed preferred over an “endless resolution process” – Such a view will prevent the likelihood of adversely affecting the interests of all the creditors who have been suffering due to no fault of their own and also securing the maximization of value of the remaining assets. [Para 148] 3.5 The consequence of the failure to implement the Resolution Plan in terms of Clause 9.4 of the Resolution Plan and Clause 3.13.7(iii) of the RFRP is that the Appellants are entitled to invoke the PBG automatically without any reference to the SRA – The PBG may be invoked by the Appellants in accordance with the terms of the Resolution Plan. [Para 149] Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Preamble – Timely implementation of the Resolution Plan is also one of the objectives of the IBC, 2016 – Report of the Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee, 2015, time-bound working of the Code emphasised; time and speed are of the essence under the Code – NCLT Rules, 2016 – NCLAT Rules, 2016 – r.15 – Power of NCLT and NCLAT to extend the time limits not be exercised mechanically without any application of mind. [Paras 150, 151, 152, 154, 157, 158] Constitution of India – Article 142 – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Plenary powers u/Article 142 – When to be [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2045 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. exercised, discussed – Inordinate delay in due implementation of the Resolution Plan, several dues including the CIRP costs of the Corporate Debtor multiplied; appellants have to incur huge expenditure and costs every month towards maintenance of the Corporate Debtor – Corporate Debtor, if to be directed to be taken in liquidation exercising power u/Article 142: Held: Yes – The fundamental concern of this Court must not only be of doing substantial and complete justice but also to ensure expeditious resolution of the issues in the interests of the underlying objective of the IBC, 2016 and all the stakeholders involved – The terms of the Resolution Plan have been contravened and that there has been a failure to implement on part of the SRA – Resolution Plan is no longer capable of being implemented – In exercise of plenary powers u/Article 142, the Corporate Debtor is directed to be taken in liquidation – NCLT Rules, 2016 – r.11.
