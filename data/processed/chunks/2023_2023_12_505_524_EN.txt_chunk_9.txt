25. This diverse Board consisting of relevant stakeholders, after having taken a holistic view of the petitioner’s case, recommended his premature release on three diff erent occasions – 10.01.2017, 26.02.2020, and 07.03.2022. Yet, the state government, has without assigning any reasons – which could have perhaps demonstrated individual consideration of each case recommended - simply rejected the same all three times (06.07.2019, 22.04.2021, and 01.09.2022). This is patently unsustainable and warrants intervention of this court. 26. That the execution of a sentence, is the sole prerogative of the State/ Executive, which may exercise its discretion as granted constitutionally (Art. 161 and 72 of the Indian Constitution) and statutorily (Section 432 CrPC, and state enactments), is one that is not in question. However, like all power – it must be exercised fairly, reasonably and not arbitrarily.24 27. While the government dated 04.06.2022 issued by the State of Kerala is not directly challenged, it is this court’s considered opinion, that it (2) A committee shall constituted under Section 72 and sub-section (1) of the Act for the computation of remission.” 24 In the context of remission and sentencing, see: State of Haryana v. Mohinder Singh [2000] 1 SCR 698; Sangeet v. State of Haryana [2012] 13 SCR 85; Union of India v. V. Sriharan [2015] 14 SCR 613; Rajan v. The Home Secretary, Home Department of Tamil Nadu [2019] 6 SCR 1035; Ram Chander v. State of Chhattisgarh [2022] 4 SCR 1103. JOSEPH v. THE STATE OF KERALA 519 [S.
