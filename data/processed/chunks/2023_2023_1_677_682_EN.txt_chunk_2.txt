A 366.1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on 1-1-2014, the date of commencement of the 2013 Act, there is no lapse of proceedings. Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of the 2013 Act. 366.2.

In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under Section 31(1) of the 1894 Act, it H is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed under Section GOVT.
