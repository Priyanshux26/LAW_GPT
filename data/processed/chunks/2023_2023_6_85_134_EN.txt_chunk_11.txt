It is submitted that this was recommended keeping in mind that the workers are the “nerve centre of any company” and that their interests H 100 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A were to be protected. It is submitted that keeping in view the Joint Committee Recommendations, the IBC was brought into force. It is submitted that Section 36(4)(a)(iii) of the IBC now excludes all sums due to any workman or employee from the Provident Fund, Pension Fund and Gratuity Fund from being included in the liquidation estate assets. It is further submitted that Section 53(1)(b)(i) and (ii) of the IBC B now ranks workmen’s dues for a period of 2 years preceding the liquidation commencement date and the debts owed to secured creditors in event of them relinquishing their security pari passu. It is submitted that dues owed to the employees are placed in Section 53(1)(c), confined to a period of 12 months, and the dues to Central Government and State C Government are placed in Section 53(1)(e)(i), confined to a period of 2 years and below that of the unsecured creditors. It is submitted that the result, therefore, is that the position and waterfall mechanism as provided for in the Companies Act, 1956 and the Companies Act, 2013 has now been altered after application of mind and resultantly, the workmen’s dues have been capped at 24 months preceding the liquidation D commencement date. The changes introduced from the erstwhile regime have been so done on the basis of an organic evolution of law and consultative process, after due consideration of the requirements of a new Code governing liquidation. 3.12 It is submitted that Section 53 Explanation (ii) of IBC states E that the term “workmen’s dues” shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in Section 326 of the Companies Act, 2013. It is submitted that thereafter, the Eleventh Schedule to the IBC proposes Amendments to be made to Companies Act, 2013. It is submitted that importantly, Clause 18 of the Schedule omits erstwhile Section 325 of the Companies Act, F 2013. It is submitted that Clause 19 of the Schedule amends Section 326 of Companies Act, 2013. Thereafter, Clause 20 of the Schedule inserts Section 327(7) to the Companies Act, 2013 which states that Section 326 and Section 327 shall not be applicable in the event of liquidation under the IBC. A conjoint reading of Section 53 Explanation (ii) of IBC and Section 327(7) of Companies Act, 2013 would indicate that only the G meaning of “workmen’s dues” is incorporated by reference into the IBC. However, the waterfall mechanism, as has been fully altered by the IBC will apply to these “workmen’s dues” and not the waterfall mechanism contained in Section 326 of Companies Act, 2013. It is submitted that the reason for introduction of Section 327(7) of Companies Act, 2013 is H only to exclude the application of waterfall mechanism and the modalities MOSER BAER KARAMCHARI UNION THR.
