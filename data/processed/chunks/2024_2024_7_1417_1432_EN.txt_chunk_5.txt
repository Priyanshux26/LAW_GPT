Insofar as the co-sharer, defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla, to the extent of 1% share is concerned, the argument is that issue no.3 framed by the Trial Court was regarding direction to furnish the accounts of rent collected from the tenants. In the case in hand, the portion in possession of the present co-sharer was never let out. Rendition of accounts and mesne profits are two different concepts. It was further argued that when the matter was pending before the High Court, defendant No.3(a) offered to give possession of the suit property with him to other co-sharers. An application9 in the paper book at page no.343 was referred to. The same is dated 27.09.2017. The argument raised is that he having offered possession cannot now be made liable to render accounts or mesne profits. He had purchased the property from defendant No.3-Bhupinder Singh. Whatever possession was available with him was given to defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla. Issue of mesne profits will come in only if the defendant No.3(a) is found to be in wrongful possession and the same was not given to other owners when asked for. 12. As far as the respondents-defendant Nos.4 & 5 are concerned, the arguments raised by the learned counsel are that when partition of an immovable property is to take place, XX Rule 18(2) of C.P.C. will be applicable. Sub-rule (2) clearly provides that at the time of passing of preliminary decree declaring the rights of several parties interested in the property, the Court may give such further directions as may be required. The Trial Court had rightly directed all the parties to render accounts either for the rent collected by them or for the portion in their possession for which the rent was assessed at the rate of ₹107/- per square ft. per month. It was pertaining to the defendant No.3(a) and the defendants Nos.15 to 19. For the portion under the control of the defendant Nos.4 & 5, 9 CM-12168-C-2017 in RSA-2761-2016 (O&M) [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1425 Rajinder Kaur (Deceased) Through Legal Heir Usha v. Gurbhajan Kaur (Deceased) Through Lrs Upinder Kaur and Others which was let out, they have already furnished the accounts. It is only the defendant No.3(a) and defendant Nos.15 to 19 who are reluctant to do the same. A simple suit for partition is pending for about two decades despite the direction issued by this Court, when the matter came at the stage of interim direction, on 10.01.201210 to decide the suit within nine months. 13. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the relevant referred record. As far as the percentage of shares of different co- sharers in the property in-question is concerned, though partly sold during the pendency of the suit, there is no dispute. As on today it stands as under: S. NAME OF SHARE TRIAL SUPREME COURT NO. PARTIES COURT 1. Rajinder Kaur 25% Plaintiff • Appellant (Thr.
