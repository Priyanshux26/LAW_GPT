[Para 168] Customs Act, 1962 – ss.17 and 28 – Issue as regards the proper officer to issue show cause notice in terms of s.28 – Sayed Ali’s case held that the Commissioner of Customs (Preventive) is not a “proper officer” as defined in s.2(34) and thus, did not have the jurisdiction to issue a show cause notice in terms of s.28; and that only such officers who are vested with the power of assessment u/s.17 can be empowered to issue show 204 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports cause notices u/s.28 or else this would result in a state of chaos and confusion – Reconsideration of Sayed Ali’s case: Held: Decision in Sayed Ali proceeds on the assumption that for the “proper officer” to exercise the functions u/s.28, such officer must necessarily possess the power of assessment and reassessment u/s.17 – However, a plain reading of ss.17 and 28 does not bring out any such inter-dependence between the two provisions – Observations pertaining to interlinkage between ss.17 and 28 respectively made in Sayed Ali’s case do not lay down the correct position of law – Even otherwise, decision in Sayed Ali’s case could have been arrived at without deciding on the interdependence of ss.17 and 28 as the Customs (Preventive) officers, whose jurisdiction to issue show cause notices was under challenge in that case, were not assigned the functions of the “proper officer” for the purposes of s.28 through a notification issued by the appropriate authority – Assignment of functions is a mandatory requirement for the exercise of jurisdiction by the “proper officer” – Observations made in Sayed Ali’s case on the connection between ss.17 and 28 are obiter dicta and do not constitute the binding ratio decidendi of that – Sayed Ali’s case could not have been relied upon in Canon India’s case as it could not have been applied for the period subsequent to 08.04.2011 since s.17 has undergone a radical change by virtue of the amendments made by the Finance Act, 2011. [Paras 81-83] Customs Act, 1962 – s.17 – Assessment of duty – Changes to s.17 w.e.f. 11.04.2011 – Amendment altered the method of assessment of bills of entry and shipping bills – Functions of the proper officer u/s.17 also underwent changes, the assessment of bill of entry and shipping bill no longer the task of the “proper officer”, they were to be self-assessed, which is to be accepted or rejected by the proper officer subject to verification in certain cases – Said changes not brought to the notice of this Court while Canon India’s case was heard – Effect: Held: On basis of the amendment to s.17, the competence of the proper officer to conduct “assessment” was completely taken away by the legislature – New s.17 empowers the proper officer to perform the functions of verification of self-assessment and subsequent re- assessment, if found necessary – However, such re-assessment [2024] 12 S.C.R. 205 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. is not a mandatory function on the same footing as “assessment” under the old s.17 – Thus, the scope of the functions of the proper officer under the new s.17 is limited – However, the attention of this Court in Canon India’s case not drawn to the important changes brought to s.17 vide s.38 of the Finance Act, 2011 with effect from 08.04.2011 – Conclusion that an officer who did the assessment, could only undertake reassessment u/s.28(4) was arrived at without taking note of the amendment to s.17 – in Canon India’s case also recorded an erroneous finding that the function of re-assessment is with reference to s.28(4) when in fact it is an exercise of function u/s.17 – In Canon India’s case the show cause notice was dated 19.09.2014 in respect of the Bill of Entry filed on 20.03.2012 – This Court erroneously applied the provisions of s.17, as they stood prior to 08.04.2011 as opposed to the amended s.17 which ought to have been applied.
