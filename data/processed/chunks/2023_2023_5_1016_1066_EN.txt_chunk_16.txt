Section 65-A provides that contents of electronic records may be admitted as evidence if the criteria provided in Section 12 2015 (7) SCC 178 H 1038 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 65-B is complied with. The computer generated electronic records in evidence are admissible at a trial if proved in the manner specified by Section 65-B of the Evidence Act. Sub-section (1) of Section 65-B makes admissible as a document, paper printout of electronic records stored in optical or magnetic media produced by a computer, subject to the fulfilment of the conditions specified B in Sub-section (2) of Section 65-B. Secondary evidence of contents of document can also be led Under Section 65 of the Evidence Act. PW 13 stated that he saw the full video recording of the fateful night in the CCTV camera, but he has not recorded the same in the case diary as nothing substantial to be C adduced as evidence was present in it. (emphasis supplied) 35. A two judge bench in Shafi Mohammed v State of Himachal Pradesh13strayed even farther away from Anvar P.V. and held that the Sections 65A and 65B cannot be held to be a complete code on the D subject. It held that: 24. We may, however, also refer to the of this Court in Anvar P.V. v. P.K. Basheer, delivered by a three-Judge Bench. In the said in para 24 it was observed that electronic evidence by way of primary evidence was covered by Section 62 E of the Evidence Act to which procedure of Section 65-B of the Evidence Act was not admissible. However, for the secondary evidence, procedure of Section 65-B of the Evidence Act was required to be followed and a contrary view taken in Navjot Sandhu that secondary evidence of electronic record could be covered under Sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act, was not F correct. There are, however, observations in para 14 to the effect that electronic record can be proved only as per Section 65-B of the Evidence Act. 25. Though in view of the three-Judge Bench s in Tomaso Bruno and Ram Singh, it can be safely held that electronic G evidence is admissible and provisions under Sections 65- A and 65-B of the Evidence Act are by way of a clarification and are procedural provisions. If the electronic evidence is authentic and relevant the same can certainly be admitted H 13 2018 (2) SCC 801 SUNDAR @ SUNDARRAJAN v. STATE BY INSPECTOR OF 1039 POLICE [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] subject to the court being satisfied about its authenticity A and procedure for its admissibility may depend on fact situation such as whether the person producing such evidence is in a position to furnish certificate under Section 65-B(4). 26. Sections 65-A and 65-B of the Evidence Act, 1872 cannot B be held to be a complete code on the subject. In Anvar P.V., this Court in para 24 clarified that primary evidence of electronic record was not covered under Sections 65-A and 65-B of the Evidence Act.
