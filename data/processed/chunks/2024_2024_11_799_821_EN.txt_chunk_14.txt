In that view of the matter, we find that the departmental proceeding had been initiated and the punishment was passed after the superannuation of the petitioner on 1.10.2010, as the initiation of the departmental proceeding was done on 18.03.2011, and the punishment was passed by the Disciplinary Authority on 7.03.2012, i.e., after the date of superannuation, which was not permissible in the eyes of law, in absence of any disciplinary Rules. Admittedly, no such Rules were brought to the notice of the Writ Court, or to the notice of this Court. 14. As such, we find no illegality in the impugned dated 6.9.2016, passed by the Writ Court in W.P. (S) No.3446 of 2014, holding that the departmental proceeding could not have been initiated and continued after the superannuation of the respondent writ petitioner, and allowing the writ application, quashing the of dismissal from service passed by the Disciplinary Authority, as well as the s of the Appellate and the Reviewing Authorities, worth any interference in exercise of the LPA jurisdiction. 820 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 28. In so far the present case is concerned, respondent was due to superannuate on 26.12.2003 apparently on completion of 30 years of service but his service was extended on 05.08.2003 from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. Thus, the extended service of the respondent came to an end on 01.10.2010. The relationship of master and servant between the appellants and the respondent came to be severed on and from 01.10.2010. The factum of receipt of subsistence allowance thereafter or the respondent declaring that he would superannuate on a later date i.e. on 30.10.2012 on attaining the age of 60 years would not make any difference to the legal and factual scenario. Therefore, it is evident that respondent was no longer in the service of SBI post 01.10.2010. 29. Attaining 60 years of service (earlier 58 years) is not the sole criterion of superannuation of an officer serving in SBI. As already noted and discussed above, it is one of the three contingencies. If any of the three contingencies are fulfilled, an officer would be superannuated. Respondent had actually superannuated from service in SBI on 26.12.2003 on completion of 30 years of service but his service was extended prior thereto on 05.08.2003 from 27.12.2003 to 01.10.2010. Post 01.10.2010 there was no further extension of service. 30. Disciplinary proceeding against the respondent was not initiated on 18.08.2009 when the first notice to show cause was issued but was initiated only on 18.03.2011 when the disciplinary authority issued the charge memo to the respondent. 31. As has been held by this Court on more than one occasion, a subsisting disciplinary proceeding i.e. one initiated before superannuation of the delinquent officer may be continued post superannuation by creating a legal fiction of continuance of service of the delinquent officer for the purpose of conclusion of the disciplinary proceeding (in this case as per Rule 19(3) of the Service Rules). But no disciplinary proceeding can be initiated after the delinquent employee or officer retires from service on attaining the age of superannuation or after the extended period of service.
