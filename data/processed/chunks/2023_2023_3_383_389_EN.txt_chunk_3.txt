D Civil Appeal Nos. 2135-2136/2023, 2142/2023, 2139/2023, 2128/ 2023, 2127/2023, 2155/2023, 2156/2023, 2154/2023, 2151/2023, 2137/ 2023, 2118/2023, 2124/2023, 2123/2023, 2125/2023 & 2112/2023 (Total 15 cases). E 4. All these appeals fall in other category, namely, in which the only relief was sought under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013 is concerned, the High Court has allowed the said writ petitions and has declared that the acquisition with respect to the lands in question is deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013, solely relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation F (supra). 5. Insofar as the impugned (s) and (s) passed by the High Court declaring that the acquisition with respect to the lands in question is deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013 is concerned, in view of the decision of the Constitution Bench in the G case of Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal & Others Etc., reported in (2020) 8 SCC 129, in the writ petitions which were filed only for such relief and which were filed after the Act, 2013 came into force are concerned, the impugned (s) and (s) passed by the High Court granting the relief under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013 is/are unsustainable. H 388 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A In some of the cases, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original writ petitioners, whose writ petitions have been dismissed, have submitted that as the possession report was not furnished, they disputed that the actual physical possession in their cases was not taken over. However, in view of the specific stand taken by the acquiring body/ beneficiary and the law laid down by this Court in the case of Indore B Development Authority (supra), the submission on behalf of the some of the original writ petitioners that as the possession report was not placed on record and therefore actual possession was not taken over, cannot be accepted. 6. Even the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective C original writ petitioners of CWP No. 4015/2006 and other allied writ petitions – respondents in the civil appeals arising out of the impugned s and s passed by the High Court in CWP No. 4015/2006, as such, have fairly conceded that in view of the law laid down by this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority (supra), the D impugned (s) and (s) passed by the High Court granting relief under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013 is/are unsustainable. However, it is prayed that as the High Court has not considered the other grounds challenging the acquisition/acquisition proceedings under the Act, 1894 on merits, though were the subject matter of writ petitions and has disposed of the writ petitions only on the deemed lapse under Section E 24(2) of the Act, 2013, the matters are required to be remanded to the High Court to consider the writ petitions on other grounds, i.e., challenge to the acquisition/acquisition proceedings under the Act, 1894 on merits.
