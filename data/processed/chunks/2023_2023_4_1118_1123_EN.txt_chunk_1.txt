Rt. No.1411 dated 26.06.2019 and G.O. Rt. No.344 dated 21.02.2020, the D State of Andhra Pradesh has preferred the present appeals. 2. The facts leading to the present appeals in nutshell are as under: 2.1 By virtue of G.O. issued on 26.06.2019, the State Government appointed a Cabinet Sub-Committee to examine the allegations of corruption against members of the erstwhile Government. On 27.12.2019, E the Cabinet Sub-Committee submitted an interim report recording a prima facie finding about certain allegations. During the meeting held on 27.12.2019, the Sub-Committee also resolved to consider handing over the investigation to the CBI/CID/Lokayukta. On the basis of the report, vide the second G.O. dated 21.02.2020, the State set up the SIT to F undertake an investigation of these allegations. The said decision was ratified by the Cabinet during its meeting held on 04.03.2020. The head of the SIT thereafter wrote to the Government on 21.03.2020 that the matter had wide-spread ramifications and therefore was required to be handed over to a Central Agency such as the CBI. Accordingly, vide letter dated 23.03.2020 the State Government requested the Central G Government to refer the matter to the CBI. On 13.07.2020, the State expressly gave its consent to the exercise of powers by the Delhi Police Establishment within the State of Andhra Pradesh, such that the CBI may conduct such an investigation in respect of the scam involving Andhra Pradesh State Fibre Net Ltd. H 1120 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 2.2 At that stage, the original writ petitioners challenged both G.O. dated 26.06.2019 and the subsequent G.O. dated 21.02.2020 before the High Court by way of the present Writ Petition No.6562 of 2020 and Writ Petition No.6711 of 2020. The State filed applications for the impleadment of the Union of India and the Enforcement Directorate, since it wished to have these allegations investigated by a Central Agency. B The High Court rejected the impleadment applications. However, thereafter by the impugned interim the High Court has stayed all further proceedings pursuant to the aforesaid two GOs. Hence, the present appeals. 3. Shri S. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Advocate appearing on C behalf of the State of Andhra Pradesh has submitted that High Court has stayed the further proceedings of the respective G.Os mainly on the following grounds: “1. Rule of law demands continuity and a new Government cannot be permitted to overturn the decisions of the previous D Government. 2. That the Government, in exercise of its executive powers, does not have an ‘inherent’ power of review. 3. That there was ‘no lacuna or gap’ that needed to be filled and that State could therefore not have exercised its E executive power. 4. That Complainant and Investigator being the same, there is likelihood of bias; 5. That Powers to constitute a Commission/SIT ought to be F sparingly used even by the Courts. Therefore, the said restriction is applicable to the Government with even more vigour.” 3.1 It is submitted that all the aforesaid grounds are completely unsustainable.
