Digital Supreme Court Reports (iii) The reservation, if any, has to be limited only for the first generation or one generation and if any generation in the family has taken advantage of the reservation and have achieved higher status, the benefit of reservation would not be logically available to the second generation; and (iv) It is reiterated that periodical exercise has to be undertaken to exclude the class of person who after taking advantage of reservation has come to march, shoulder to shoulder with the general category. 85. The reference is accordingly answered and it is held that sub- classification of scheduled castes is permissible in law for the purposes of reservation. Satish Chandra Sharma, J. 1. I have had the privilege of reading the lucid and detailed opinion(s) authored by Hon’ble Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, Chief Justice of India and Hon’ble Mr. Justice B.R. Gavai, respectively. I am fully in agreement with both opinions to the extent that the validity of sub-classification within Scheduled Castes has been held to be constitutionally permissible. Moreover, I am fully in agreement with the opinion(s) to the extent that any exercise involving sub-classification by the State, must be supported by empirical data that ought to underscore the more ‘disadvantaged’ status of the sub-group to which such preferential treatment is sought to be provided vis-à-vis the Constitutional Class as a whole. 2. However, on the question of applicability of the ‘creamy layer principle’ to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, I find myself in agreement with the view expressed by Justice Gavai i.e., for the full realisation of substantive equality inter se the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the identification of the ‘creamy layer’ qua Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes ought to become a constitutional imperative for the State. Result of the case: Reference answered. †Headnotes prepared by: Bibhuti Bhushan Bose
