A over the requisition agency. It is further submitted that the compensation was deposited with the Reference Court vide cheque number 389384 dated 3.9.1965 however the same was returned by the court of Ld. ADJ and thereafter deposited in Treasury vide cheque number 394710 dated 10.3.1967.” B 2.3 Despite the above, the High Court, by the impugned and has allowed the writ petition and has declared that the acquisition with respect to the land in question is deemed to have lapsed as the assessed compensation was never paid to the original owners – Bodey Singh or his acknowledged successor-in-interest – Panna Lal and instead the same was deposited sometime in the year 1967 with the Treasury. C That thereafter, relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. Vs. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki and Ors., (2014) 3 SCC 183, the High Court has allowed the writ petition and has declared that the acquisition with respect to the land in question is deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the D Act, 2013. 3. From the counter affidavit filed before the High Court, it can be seen that it was the specific case on behalf of the appellant and the Government of NCT of Delhi that the possession of the land was duly taken on 01.05.1964 and handed over to the requisition agency. It was E also the case on behalf of the appellant that the compensation was deposited with the Reference Court vide cheque number 389384 dated 03.09.1965, however, the same was returned by the Court of Ld. ADJ and thereafter deposited in the Treasury on 10.3.1967. 3.1 From the impugned and passed by the High F Court, it appears that the High Court has not accepted the case on behalf of the appellant that the actual vacant physical possession of the land in question was taken over solely on the ground that the land is vacant and the vacant portions in fact have been mortgaged and who constructed the boundary wall, which cannot be recited in the present proceedings. G However, it is required to be noted that it was never the case on behalf of the original writ petitioners that they constructed the boundary wall. Against which, it was the specific case on behalf of the Government of NCT of Delhi that the possession of the land in question was taken over in the year 1964 and handed over to the requisition agency. It has come on record that on some portion, there was a construction and the rest H NORTH DELHI MUNICIPAL CORPORATION v. RAM 423 CHANDER SINGH AND ORS. [M. R. SHAH, J.] was vacant to be surrounded by boundary wall. Thus, there is no reason A to disbelieve the case on behalf of the appellant that in fact the physical possession of the land in question was not taken over on 01.05.1964. 3.2 Even otherwise, the amount of compensation was initially deposited with the Reference Court and thereafter deposited in the Treasury in the year 1967.
