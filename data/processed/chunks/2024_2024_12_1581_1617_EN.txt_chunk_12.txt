Learned Single Judge had set aside the clarification of the learned Arbitrator by accepting the contention of the appellant which was upheld by the Division Bench. Special leave petition filed by the respondent against the aforesaid of the Division Bench was allowed by this Court vide the dated 12.03.2015; s of the learned Single Judge as well as of the Division Bench of the High Court whereby the clarification issued by the learned Arbitrator was set aside were reversed by this Court vide the dated 12.03.2015. Thirdly, appellant had filed a miscellaneous application before this Court seeking clarification of the aforesaid dated 12.03.2015. In the said application, it was specifically pleaded that the dated 12.03.2015 only considered the issue of interest: 1598 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports whether governed by S.L. Arora (supra) or by M/s. Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. (supra) and that other issues contained in the of the learned Single Judge dated 19.02.2008 were not considered by this Court. After arguing the miscellaneous application at considerable length, appellant unconditionally withdrew the same when it was about to be dismissed. Mr. Sundaram submits that when an objection is raised but not pressed, it must be taken to have been impliedly overruled. Therefore, the party that had raised objection earlier would be precluded from raising the same again in view of the bar of res judicata. Thus, appellant is debarred from raising the same issue again and again (in this case for the fourth time). 33.1. Learned senior counsel submits that the principle of constructive res judicata is applicable to execution proceeding as well and in this connection, relies upon a decision of this Court in Mohanlal Goenka Vs. Benoy Kishna Mukherjee.6 33.2.

Referring to the decision of this court in Gas Authority of India Limited Vs. Keti Construction (I) Limited,7 he submits that if objection as to jurisdiction is not raised before the Arbitral Tribunal, the same cannot be allowed to be raised later in subsequent proceedings. 33.3. Proceeding further, Mr. Sundaram, learned senior counsel submits that after the learned Arbitrator had issued the clarification dated 15.03.2005, no petition was filed by the appellant under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. Therefore, appellant had consciously waived off its right to challenge the said clarification which has thus become final. 33.4. Referring to the decision of this Court in M/s. Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. (supra), learned senior counsel submits that this 6 (1952) 2 SCC 648 7 (2007) 5 SCC 38 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1599 North Delhi Municipal Corporation v. M/s. S.A. Builders Ltd.
