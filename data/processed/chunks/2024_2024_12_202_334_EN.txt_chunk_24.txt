3. In the circumstances, it has become necessary to clarify the true legislative intent that Show Cause Notices issued by Customs officers, i.e., officers of the Commissionerates of Customs (Preventive), Directorate General of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence (DGCEI) and Central Excise Commissionerates for demanding customs duty not levied or short levied or erroneously refunded in respect of goods imported are valid, irrespective of the fact that any specific assignment as proper officer was issued or not. It is, therefore, purposed to amend the Customs Act, 1962 retrospectively and to validate anything done or any action taken under the said Act in pursuance of the provisions of the said Act at all material times irrespective of issuance of any specific assignment on 6th July, 2011. 4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.” (v) Finally, the Validation Act came to be passed on 16.09.2011 and Sub-Section (11) became part of Section 28. 45. He contended that Explanation 2 and the introduction of Section 28(11) are for distinct purposes and are not connected to each other in any way. Prior to 08.04.2011, the period of limitation available under the statute for demanding short levy, non-levy or erroneous refund was six months. Whereas after 08.04.2011, it was enhanced to one year. As the amendment substituted the then-existing Section 28, it provided a saving provision to protect the notices issued 240 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports prior to 08.04.2011 from the extension of limitation period from 6 months to one year. He submitted that the purport of Explanation 2 was only to ensure that those rights envisaged under old Section 28 stand preserved. Explanation 2 did not deal with the jurisdictional exercise of the power of DRI officers in issuing show cause notices under Section 28, whereas, the Validation Act, 2011, introducing Section 28(11) addressed precisely only that issue. 46. He submitted that the conclusion drawn in Mangali Impex (supra) was legally incorrect for holding that Section 28(11) is overbroad in assuming every officer of customs to be deemed as proper officers both for Sections 17 and 28. The Validation Act, 2011, was enacted to regularize only past actions and not future actions, which are governed by Notification No. 44/2011 dated 06.07.2011 which even according to the High Court is valid and proper. Consequently, the validation has a very limited role to play as it travels back only to empower such of those officers of customs who had issued show cause notices in the past and vesting them also with the power under Section 17. 47. He submitted that the decision in Sunil Gupta (supra) clarifies the correct legal position and should be held to be so by this Court. iv. Changes introduced by the Finance Act, 2022 are in the nature of surplusage 48. Lastly, he referred to the amendments brought about by the Finance Act, 2022, vide Sections 86, 87, 88, 94 and 97. The same are extracted below: Section 86 - Amendment of section 2 of the Act, 1962 “86.
