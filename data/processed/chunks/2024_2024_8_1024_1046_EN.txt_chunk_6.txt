Mr. Patil, appearing for the respondents, has submitted that there are three primary factors, among several others, that caused the delay – (i) time taken for converting the land; (ii) time taken for the KERC to approve the PPA; and (iii) time taken for the evacuation approval. He submits that these concerns have been raised by not only the respondents in the present case but in several other cases. Due to the extent to which SPDs were facing these issues, the government directed DISCOMs to set up committees to look into the same and consider the facts of each case individually. It is pursuant to this direction that the respondents’ case was considered by the appellant, who granted a 6-month extension on 02.03.2017 by exercising its power under Article 2.5 read with Article 8.3 of the PPA. He submits that it was incorrect for the KERC to then require the respondents to file a separate petition to seek extension as the same is not as per the terms of the PPA. He further submits that the KERC had perversely appreciated the evidence regarding delay and that it should not have rejected the petition when the appellant had already granted the extension. Further, he submitted that the respondents were able to complete the project within the extended time period. 6.1 Mr. Patil also took us through several s of this Court8 that dismiss appeals arising out of similar s by the APTEL. He has specifically referred to the APTEL’s decision in Chennamangathihalli Solar Power Project LLP v. BESCOM 9 and has submitted that this decision has been relied on by the APTEL in several subsequent decisions arising out of similar facts, including the present impugned . This Court has dismissed the appeal arising out of Chennamangathihalli (supra)10 and appeals from other APTEL s relying on it. Mr. Nataraj, in his written submissions, has sought to differentiate these cases from the present matter on facts. 7. Scope of Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction under Section 125 of the Act: Before we deal with the submissions of the learned counsels, we must take note of the scope of our appellate jurisdiction under Section 125, which reads: 8 In Civil Appeal No. 3958/2020; Civil Appeal No. 897/2022; Civil Appeal No. 5134/2021; Civil Appeal Diary Nos. 32980/2022, 33053/2022 and 33572/2022. 9 2020 SCC OnLine APTEL 75. 10 In Civil Appeal No. 3958/2020. 1034 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “Section 125. (Appeal to Supreme Court): Any person aggrieved by any decision or of the Appellate Tribunal, may, file an appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of communication of the decision or of the Appellate Tribunal, to him, on any one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908…” 7.1 Section 100 of the CPC restricts the High Court’s jurisdiction in second appeals to cases that involve ‘substantial questions of law’. There are two components to this requirement – (i) there must be a ‘question of law’; and (ii) such question of law must be ‘substantial’.
