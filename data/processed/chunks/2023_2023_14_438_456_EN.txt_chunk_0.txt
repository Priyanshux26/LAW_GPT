[2023] 14 S.C.R. 438 : 2023 INSC 837 CASE DETAILS THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH AND OTHERS v. BHUPENDRA YADAV (Civil Appeal No. 5984 of 2023) SEPTEMBER 20, 2023 [HIMA KOHLI AND RAJESH BINDAL, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Whether the appellants have erred in rejecting the candidature of the respondent to the post of Constable, despite the latter having truthfully disclosed in his affi davit the fact that he had faced trial in a criminal case which had resulted in his acquittal. Service Law – Rejection of candidature by the departmental authorities on basis of moral turpitude – Propriety: Held: An employer has the discretion to terminate or condone an omission in the disclosure made by a candidate – While doing so, the employer must act with prudence, keep in mind the nature of the post and the duties required to be discharged – Higher the post, more stringent ought to be the standards to be applied – Even if a truthful disclosure has been made, the employer is well within its right to examine the fi tness of a candidate and in a concluded criminal case, keep in mind the nature of the off ence and verify whether the acquittal is honourable or benefi t has been extended on technical reasons – If the employer arrives at a conclusion that the incumbent is of a suspect character or unfi t for the post, he may not be appointed or continued in service – In the instant case, even though the respondent had truthfully declared that he was involved in a criminal case which was decided by the trial Court, on perusing the facts of the said case, it is clear that it was not a case of clean acquittal – It is evident from the facts narrated that after the charge-sheet was fi led, the respondent had arrived at a compromise with the complainant, based on which the off ence u/s. 341 IPC was compounded – As for the remaining off ences for which the respondent was charged i.e. s.354(D) of the IPC and s.11 (D)/12 of the 438 THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH AND OTHERS v. 439 BHUPENDRA YADAV POCSO Act, they were non compoundable and therefore, the matter was taken to trial – The respondent was acquitted by the trial Court primarily on account of the fact that the complainant did not support the case set up by the prosecution and the other prosecution witnesses had turned hostile – In such circumstances, the respondent’s plea that he had been given a clean acquittal in the criminal case, is found to be devoid of merits – Mere acquittal of the respondent in the criminal case would not automatically entitle him to being declared fi t for appointment to the subject post.
