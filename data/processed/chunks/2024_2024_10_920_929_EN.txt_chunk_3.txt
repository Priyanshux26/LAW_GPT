16 in the High Court and Tribunal’s . 8 [2009] 5 SCR 1098 : (2009) 6 SCC 121 : 2009 INSC 506 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 925 Chandramani Nanda v. Sarat Chandra Swain and Another 9. Aggrieved against the said award of the Tribunal, the present appellant as well as the Insurance Company preferred appeals9 before the High Court. The High Court opined that the appellant had suffered 100% functional disability as against 60% assessed by the Tribunal because even if the disability from persistent neurocognitive is 60%, such disability entails 100% loss of earning capacity. The High Court modified the Award of the Tribunal and enhanced the amount of compensation from ₹20,60,385/- to ₹30,99,873/-. Head Compensation (in ₹) Loss of future income 25,98,720/- (₹1,62,420 x 16 x 100% disability) Medical Expenditure 3,51,153/- Mental agony and suffering 50,000/- Future medical expenses 1,00,000/- Total 30,99,873/- along with interest @ 6% per annum 10. In the present SLP, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that while assessing the compensation, the Tribunal as well as the High Court have failed to appreciate that the income claimed by appellant was ₹22,000/- per month i.e. ₹2,64,000/- per annum. However, the assessment of compensation was made by taking the income at ₹1,62,420/- per annum, which pertained to assessment year 2011-12 i.e. financial year 2010-11. It is to be noted that the accident had taken place on 16.01.2014, i.e. after 02 years from the said financial year. 10.1 It was further submitted that the amount of compensation should be enhanced by including factor of future prospect as it has not been considered by the Tribunal and High Court. Further, he should be awarded enhanced compensation under the head of future medical expenses as he would be required to incur medical expenses on a regular basis, and should also be granted compensation for an attendant. 9 MACA No.256 of 2019 by the appellant and MACA No.350 of 2021 by the Insurance Company 926 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 10.2 Learned counsel for appellant also submitted that compensation on account of mental agony, pain and suffering and loss of amenities as assessed by the Tribunal is also on lower side as the appellant will undergo pain and suffering due to injuries and will go through mental agony throughout his life on account of brain injury. 11. On the other hand, learned counsel for the Insurance Company submitted that the assessment of compensation by the High Court is on the higher side. There is no scope of further enhancement specially keeping in view the fact that the appellant had claimed a sum of ₹30,00,000/- as compensation, and the High Court has already awarded more than that. However, still being reasonable, the Insurance Company did not prefer any appeal. 12. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the relevant materials on record. 13. For the purpose of clarification, the High Court enhanced the compensation to Rs. 30,99,873 from Rs. 20,60,385 as awarded by Tribunal. This was done by considering the functional disability at 100% as opposed to 60%, as assessed by the Tribunal.
