4061/2 in the Ennore Expressway. The appellant thereafter, according to it, started the process to seek approvals for laying an underground pipeline of 4.5 kilometres to the said storage facility. On payment of Rs.5097921/-, the Chennai Fishing D Harbour Management Committee granted permission to lay the underground pipeline. The NHAI granted permission to lay the underground pipeline. On 03.03.2015, allegedly based on inspection of the storage facility, and on payment of charges, including service tax, the Chennai Port Trust granted permission for laying the underground E pipeline from the Chennai Port to the storage facility. On 10.07.2015, purporting to act under paragraph-4 of the 2011 Notification, the appellant made a proposal to the District Coastal Management Authority, Chennai (hereinafter referred to as ‘the DCZMA’). It would appear that the said Body recommended the proposal. The third respondent, viz., the Tamil Nadu State Coastal Zonal Management Authority (hereinafter referred F to as, ‘the State Authority’) considered the proposal and it forwarded the same through the second respondent, viz., the State of Tamil Nadu to the first respondent, viz., the Union of India, in the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change. Respondent No.4, viz., the Expert Appraisal Committee, CRZ, sought two clarifications. On G 24.08.2016, the Chennai Port Trust issued a Certificate and permitted the laying of the pipeline, which, according to the appellant, was based on the need to avoid usage of tanker lorries and as it resulted in better handling of vessels at the Port. While the recommendation of the third respondent was pending before the first respondent, appellant started laying the pipeline with the prior permission of the NHAI, the Chennai H K.T.V. HEALTH FOOD PVT. LTD. v. UNION OF INDIA AND 257 ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] Fishing Harbour Committee and the Port Trust. On 19.10.2016, A Respondent No. 5 filed O.A. No. 238 of 2016 against the activities of the appellant in question. A Local Commissioner was appointed, who inspected the Facility. We may, at this juncture, notice the following physical features noticed during the inspection. “1) The premises of the 12th Respondent (in A. No. 238 of 2016), B M/s. KTV Health Foods Pvt. Ltd., is situated at No.1,2,3, Suriyanarayana Chetty Street, Tondiarpet, Chennai- 600 001, facing the Bay of Bengal. In between the premises of the 12th respondent and Bay of Bengal, the State Highway (Ennore Express Highway) runs North to South. The State Highway measures about C 120 Feet in width and from the road, there is a space of about 40 Feet up to the sea shore. Thus, the distance between the entrance of the 12th respondent and the seashore is about 160 Feet.” [The appellant was the 12th Respondent] 4. The NGT disposed of the said O.A. noting that the storage D facility was closed and that till the first respondent took a decision, no activity will be carried out. It would appear that Respondent No. 4 recommended the proposal for CRZ clearance, subject to certain conditions. This was even after finding that there was no provision in the 2011 Notification, but taking inspiration from the provisions of the 2006 E Notification.On 06.02.2018, the 2011 Notification was amended by the insertion of paragraph-4.3.
