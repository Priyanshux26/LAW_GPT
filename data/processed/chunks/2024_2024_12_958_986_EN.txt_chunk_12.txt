59.7. The age of the deceased should be the basis for applying the multiplier. 59.8. Reasonable figures on conventional heads, namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium and funeral expenses should be Rs 15,000, Rs 40,000 and Rs 15,000 respectively. The aforesaid amounts should be enhanced at the rate of 10% in every three years.” (emphasis supplied) 31. Accordingly, to arrive at the compensation to be awarded under the head of loss of income and earnings due to disability, 40% should be added for future prospects and a multiplier of 18 would have to be applied in view of the age of the appellant. 32. The same approach was adopted by this Court in the cases of Kajal (supra) and Master Ayush (supra). 33. Therefore, in the present case, the compensation under this head would be Rs. [4,358 + (40% of 4,358)] x 12 x 18 = Rs.13,17,859/- and rounded it off to Rs. 13,18,000/-. b) Pain and Suffering 34. As has been referred to hereinabove, this Court recently in the case of K.S. Muralidhar (supra) relying inter-alia upon the previous 978 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports decisions of this Court in the cases of Kajal (supra) and Master Ayush (supra) awarded a sum of Rs. 15,00,000/- under the head of pain and suffering to the appellant therein. 35. In this respect, it would be appropriate to refer to paragraphs 26 and 27 of the of this Court in the case of Kajal (supra), which read thus: “Pain, suffering and loss of amenities 26. Coming to the non-pecuniary damages under the head of pain, suffering, loss of amenities, the High Court has awarded this girl only Rs 3,00,000. In Mallikarjun v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. [Mallikarjun v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. (2014) 14 SCC 396 : (2015) 1 SCC (Civ) 335 : (2015) 1 SCC (Cri) 372 : (2013) 10 Scale 668], this Court while dealing with the issue of award under this head held that it should be at least Rs 6,00,000, if the disability is more than 90%. As far as the present case is concerned, in addition to the 100% physical disability, the young girl is suffering from severe incontinence, she is suffering from severe hysteria and above all she is left with a brain of a nine-month-old child. This is a case where departure has to be made from the normal rule and the pain and suffering suffered by this child is such that no amount of compensation can compensate. 27. One factor which must be kept in mind while assessing the compensation in a case like the present one is that the claim can be awarded only once. The claimant cannot come back to court for enhancement of award at a later stage praying that something extra has been spent. Therefore, the courts or the Tribunals assessing the compensation in a case of 100% disability, especially where there is mental disability also, should take a liberal view of the matter when awarding the compensation.
