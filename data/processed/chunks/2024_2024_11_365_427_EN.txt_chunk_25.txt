“The power to amend the fundamental instrument cannot carry with it the power to destroy its essential features — this, in brief, is the arch of the theory of basic structure. It is wholly out of place in matters relating to the validity of ordinary laws made under the Constitution.] [2024] 11 S.C.R. 401 Anjum Kadari & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. the validity of statutes because statutes cannot go beyond the range of constituent power.56 51. In State of Karnataka v. Union of India,57 Justice N L Untwalia (writing for himself, Justice P N Shingal, and Justice Jaswant Singh) reiterated that the validity of a statute cannot be tested for violation of the basic structure of the Constitution. Justice Y V Chandrachud (as the learned Chief Justice then was) also observed that a statute cannot be invalidated on supposed grounds so long as it is within the legislative competence of the legislature and consistent with Part III of the Constitution.58 However, Chief Justice M H Beg observed that testing a statute for violation of basic structure does not “add to the contents of the Constitution.”59 He held that any inference about a limitation based on the basic structure doctrine upon legislative power must co-relate to the express provisions of the Constitution.60 52. In Kuldip Nayar v. Union of India,61 a Constitution Bench held that ordinary legislation cannot be challenged for the violation of the basic structure of the Constitution. Statutes, including State legislation, can only be challenged for violating the provisions of the Constitution.62 However, in Madras Bar Association v.

The basic structure theory imposes limitation on the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. An amendment to the Constitution under Article 368 could be challenged on the ground of violation of the basic structure of the Constitution. An ordinary legislation cannot be so challenged. The challenge to a law made, within its legislative competence, by Parliament on the ground of violation of the basic structure of the Constitution is thus not available to the petitioners.”] 62 Ashok Kumar Thakur v. Union of India (2008) 6 SCC 1 [116] 63 Madras Bar Association v. Union of India (2014) 10 SCC 1 [109] [“This Court has repeatedly held that an amendment to the provisions of the Constitution would not be sustainable if it violated the “basic structure” of the Constitution, even though the amendment had been carried out by following the procedure contemplated under “Part XI” of the Constitution. This leads to the determination that the “basic structure” is inviolable. In our view, the same would apply to all other legislations (other than amendments to the Constitution) as well, even though the legislation had been enacted by following the prescribed procedure, and was within the domain of the enacting legislature, any infringement to the “basic structure” would be unacceptable.”] 402 [2024] 11 S.C.R.
