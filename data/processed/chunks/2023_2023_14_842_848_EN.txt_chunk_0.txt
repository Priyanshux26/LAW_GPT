[2023] 14 S.C.R. 842 : 2023 INSC 1019 CASE DETAILS MOHAR SINGH (DEAD) THROUGH LRS. & ORS. v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH COLLECTOR & ORS. (Civil Appeal Nos.7504-7505 of 2023) NOVEMBER 07, 2023 [SURYA KANT AND DIPANKAR DATTA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Appellants if entitled to seek parity with their co-villagers in the grant of compensation for their acquired land despite the inordinate delay in fi ling fi rst appeals. Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – Compensation – Parity sought with co-villagers – Delay of 13 years in fi ling of the fi rst appeals – Condonation: Held: Appellants are entitled to seek parity with their co-villagers in the grant of compensation for their acquired land – The inordinate delay in fi ling appeal in compensatory matters, per se, may not be fatal as the rights and equities between the parties can be well balanced by denying the statutory benefi ts, such as interest for the delayed period – Thus, the delay in fi ling the fi rst appeal(s) could be condoned subject to the condition that the appellants would not be entitled to enure undue benefi t for the delayed period – Such indulgence is being granted in the appellant’s favour also because a batch of fi rst appeals at the instance of other land owners was still pending consideration before the High Court – The delay of nearly 13 years in fi ling of their fi rst appeals is being condoned, only to accord parity between the similarly placed land-owners on the anvil of Article 14 – If the appellants are granted compensation higher than their co-landowners, despite the fact that such counterparts were vigilant in pursuing their remedy promptly, it will lead to hostile discrimination viz those landowners whose fate already stands sealed upto this Court and will amount to granting premium on stale, belated and chance claim of the appellants – Appellants 842 MOHAR SINGH (DEAD) THROUGH LRS. & ORS. v. STATE 843 OF UTTAR PRADESH COLLECTOR & ORS. entitled to compensation @ Rs.150 per sq. yard for their respective acquired land – However, the compensation amount shall not include statutory interest, including on solatium, as per the rate prescribed u/s.34 of the Act for the period from the date of passing of the award by the Reference Court u/s.18 of the Act till the fi ling of the respective fi rst appeals before the High Court – Constitution of India – Article 14.
