The High Court, in exercise of the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, also cannot direct the Government and/ or the Department to formulate a particular regularization policy. Framing of any scheme is no function of the Court and is the sole prerogative of the Government. Even the creation and/or sanction of the posts is also the sole prerogative of the Government and the High Court, in exercise of the power under Article 226 of the Constitution, cannot issue Mandamus and/or direct to create and sanction the posts.” (Emphasis Supplied) 20. The above being the settled position of law, it only stands to reason that a Tribunal functioning within the strict boundaries of the governing legislation, would not have the power to direct the formation of a policy. After all, a court in Writ jurisdiction is often faced with situations that allegedly fl y in the face of fundamental rights, and yet, has not been entrusted with the power to direct such formation of policy. 14 2021 SCC OnLine SC 899(2 Judge Bench) 104 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 21. Not only that, it stands clarifi ed by a bench of no less than 7 Judges of this Court in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India & Ors15 as reiterated by a Bench of 5 judges in Rojer Matthew v.

It is hence clear post L. Chandra Kumar [L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 577] that writ jurisdiction under Article 226 does not limit the powers of High Courts expressly or by implication against military or armed forces disputes. The limited ouster made by Article 227(4) only operates qua administrative supervision by the High Court and not judicial review. Article 136(2) prohibits direct appeals before the Supreme Court from an of Armed Forces Tribunals, but would not prohibit an appeal to the Supreme Court against the judicial review exercised by the High Court under Article 226. 217. The jurisdiction under Article 226, being part of the basic structure, can neither be tampered with nor diluted. Instead, it has to be zealously protected and cannot be circumscribed by the provisions of any enactment, even if it be formulated for expeditious disposal and early fi nality of disputes. Further, High Courts are conscious enough to understand that such power must be exercised sparingly by them to ensure that they do not become alternate forums of appeal. A fi ve- Judge Bench in Sangram Singh v. Election Tribunal [Sangram Singh v. Election Tribunal, (1955) 2 SCR 1 : AIR 1955 SC 425] whilst reiterating that jurisdiction under Article 226 could not be ousted, laid down certain guidelines for exercise of such power : (AIR pp. 428-29, para 13) “13.
