July, 2021 A quash petition is filed and a compromise is reached. 30.07.2021 The High Court quashes CC No.25 of 2021 on the basis of the Joint Compromise Memo. H 1064 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 43. On the basis of the above timeline of events, it is contended by Shri Kapil Sibal that the Minister was implicated in the case on 08.03.2021, for offences under the PC Act immediately after the announcement of the elections to the Legislative Assembly, as he had switched over from the party in power to another. Therefore, it is claimed that the appellant is obviously set up by the political opponents in hot B pursuit of the Minister. 44. But all that we could make out of the above timeline of events is that trouble started for the Minister, even when he was a Minister in a different political dispensation and even before he became part of a group of 18 MLAs in August, 2017. It must be remembered that the C allegations in Criminal O.P. No.7503 of 2016, disposed of by the High Court on 20.06.2016, were made at a time when he was still a Minister in the previous regime and it happened more than a year before he became part of a splinter group. In the dated 20.06.2016, it was recorded as a contention of the counsel for the petitioner in paragraph 6 D that the Police had seen to it that the name of the Minister did not figure in the complaint, in to shield him. That the Investigation Officer did not choose to include the offences under the PC Act from the year 2015 till 08.03.2021, cannot be taken to the credit of the Minister, but should be taken as a discredit of the prosecution. If the shield of office protected him from 2015 till he formed part of E the splinter group and the shield stood temporarily removed for a brief period of time until he again became a Minister in the next regime, the same cannot be said to be a case of political vendetta.
