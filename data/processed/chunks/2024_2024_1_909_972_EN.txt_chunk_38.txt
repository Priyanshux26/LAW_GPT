92. It is needless to state that this Court, time and again, in various s including the one in the case of GMR Warora Energy Limited (supra) has recognised the requirement of balancing the consumers’ interest with that of the interest of the generators. It will not be permissible to take a lopsided view only to protect the interest of the generators ignoring the consumers’ interest and public interest. 93. We find that the High Court was not justified in entertaining the petition. The Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of PTC India Limited (supra) has held that the Electricity Act is an exhaustive code on all matters concerning electricity. Under the Electricity Act, all issues dealing with electricity have to be considered by the authorities constituted under the said Act. As held by the Constitution Bench of this Court, the State Electricity Commission and the learned APTEL have ample powers to adjudicate in the matters with regard to electricity. Not only that, these Tribunals are tribunals consisting of experts having vast experience in the field of electricity. As such, we [2024] 1 S.C.R. 965 Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v. MB Power (Madhya Pradesh) Limited & Ors. find that the High Court erred in directly entertaining the writ petition when the respondent No.1, i.e., the writ petitioner before the High Court had an adequate alternate remedy of approaching the State Electricity Commission. 94. This Court in the case of Reliance Infrastructure Limited v. State of Maharashtra and others11 has held that while exercising its power of judicial review, the Court can step in where a case of manifest unreasonableness or arbitrariness is made out. 95. In the present case, there is not even an allegation with regard to that effect. In such circumstances, recourse to a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in the availability of efficacious alternate remedy under a statute, which is a complete code in itself, in our view, was not justified. 96. No doubt that availability of an alternate remedy is not a complete bar in the exercise of the power of judicial review by the High Courts. But, recourse to such a remedy would be permissible only if extraordinary and exceptional circumstances are made out. A reference in this respect could be made to the s of this Court in the cases of Radha Krishan Industries v. State of Himachal Pradesh and others12 and South Indian Bank Ltd. and others v. Naveen Mathew Philip and another13. 97. We may gainfully refer to the observation of this Court in the case of Radha Krishan Industries (supra), wherein this Court has laid down certain principles after referring to the earlier s: “24. The High Court has dealt with the maintainability of the petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. Relying on the decision of this Court in CCT v. Glaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Care Ltd. [CCT v. Glaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Care Ltd., (2020) 19 SCC 681 : 2020 SCC OnLine SC 440], the High Court noted that although it can entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, it must not do so when the 11 [2019] 1 SCR 886 : (2019) 3 SCC 352=2019 INSC 63 12 [2021] 3 SCR 406 : (2021) 6 SCC 771=2021 INSC 266 13 [2023] 4 SCR 18 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 435 =2023 INSC 379 966 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
