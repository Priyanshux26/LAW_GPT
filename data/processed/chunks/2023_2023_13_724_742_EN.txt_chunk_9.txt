The Bench fi nally concluded that “The interpretation we have put to the provisions pertinently relate to sub-clauses (ii) and (iii) of clause (q) of Section 2. This interpretation in express terms cannot apply to sub- clause (i) of clause (q) of Section 2. Johnson case [(1983) 4 SCC 110] as said before, is a case under sub-clause (i) of clause (q) of Section 2. …….. xx……….. xx…………xx……….xx” 23. In Angoori Devi (Smt.) vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others3, a two-Judge Bench of this Court was confronted with a dispute re: the 3 (1997) 2 SCC 434 M/S. KEWAL COURT PVT. LTD. AND ANR. v. THE STATE 737 OF WEST BENGAL AND ORS. [SURYA KANT, J.] interpretation of sub-section (9) of Section 4 read with sub-section (q) of Section 2 of the Ceiling Act. The State of Uttar Pradesh relied upon Jhonson1. It was then pointed out that Jhonson1 was considered and distinguished by a three-Judge Bench in Meera Gupta2. This Court, thereafter, took stock of the anomalous observation in Meera Gupta2 to the eff ect that Jhonson1 was a case dealing with sub-clause (i) of Section 2(q) of the Ceiling Act. After the correct appraisal of Jhonson1 which was actually a case of ‘vacant land’ within the meaning of sub-clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section 2(q) and was not confi ned to Section 2(q)(i) only, the matter was referred to a Larger Bench as may be seen from the following operative part of the : “17. It has been contended that Johnson case [(1983) 4 SCC 110] had specifi cally dealt with the defi nition of vacant land as given in Section 2(q)(ii) and (iii). It will not be right to say that the Johnson case [(1983) 4 SCC 110] was confi ned to Section 2(q)(i) of the Act. 18. There is some force in this contention. The principle laid down in Meera Gupta case [(1992) 2 SCC 494] has been applied in the case of Atma Ram Aggarwal v. State of U.P. [1993 Supp (1) SCC 1]. Since Meera Gupta case [(1992) 2 SCC 494] was decided by a Bench of three Judges, the contention raised by the respondents should be considered by a larger Bench. This case may be placed before the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate direction.” 24. Angoori Devi3 was then placed before a three-Judge Bench on March 19, 1997 when it was referred to a Larger Bench of fi ve-Judges. The reference is reported as Angoori Devi (Smt.) vs. State of U.P. and Others4. 25. However, before the matter could be heard by a fi ve-Judge Bench, the legal regime underwent a complete U-turn. The Ceiling Act was repealed initially by way of an Ordinance notifi ed on 11th January, 1999, initially in the States of Haryana, Punjab and all the Union Territories. The Parliament thereafter enacted the Urban Land [Ceiling and Regulation] Repeal Act, 1999 which came into force in the States of Haryana and Punjab and all the Union of Territories with eff ect from 11th January, 1999, and in other States 4 (1997) 7 SCC 757 738 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R.
