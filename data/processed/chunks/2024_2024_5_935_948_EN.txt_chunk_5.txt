Note 2.- The percentage of marks obtained by the candidate in the Higher Secondary, Madhyamik Examination or its equivalent excluding additional marks, if any, shall be reduced proportionately to marks obtained out of 10. Note 3.- The percentage of marks obtained by the candidate in the relevant Teacher Training shall be reduced proportionately to marks obtained out of 15. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 943 Ali Hossain Mandal & Ors. v. West Bengal Board of Primary Education & Ors. Note 4.- The percentage of marks obtained by the candidate in the TET Examination shall be reduced proportionately to marks obtained out of 5. Note 5.- Marks out of maximum five (5) Marks as mentioned in Sl. No. (v) of Table A of this rule shall be awarded to the candidates, including para teacher, in the following manner:- Sl. No. Extra Curricular Activities Marks 1 Games and Sports 1 2 National Cadet Corps (NCC) 1 3 Arts and Literature 1 4 Performing Art (Drama) 1 5 Music 1 Total: 5 18. The evaluation criteria envisages marks to be awarded on relevant academic qualifications, NCTE-mandated training, performance in TET, extra-curricular activities, performance in the viva-voce and aptitude test to the aspirants. Even within the criteria, extra-curricular activities are to be awarded as per the candidate’s experience in music, arts, drama, literature, etc. 19. As specified under the Recruitment Rules, 2016, the panel under Rule 2(l) of eligible/selected candidates is to be prepared bearing in mind the aggregate of marks provided in Rule 8(3) and Table A appended thereto. It is clear that the evaluation criteria to be taken into account as per Table A and Rule 8(3) is a far more comprehensive method of evaluating a candidate’s suitability for the post than the performance in TET i.e., a qualifying examination for teaching eligibility. The impugned however directed that appointments against the remaining 3929 vacancies shall be made in a descending of candidates’ respective inter-se positions in TET Eligibility List 2014. 20. Therefore, the manner of shortlisting candidates for appointment as directed by the Division Bench is at loggerheads with and in departure from the procedure envisaged under Rule 8. Being inconsistent with the Recruitment Rules, 2016, such a direction cannot be sustained. 944 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 21. The next issue is whether the remaining 3929 vacancies are to be treated exclusively as part of 16,500 vacancies for which the recruitment process commenced via a Notification dated 23.12.2020, or whether such vacancies can be carried forward to the next recruitment cycle that commenced via a Notification dated 29.09.2022 instead. 22. Although the first advertisement reflected a total of 16,500 vacancies, the Merit List (notified on 15.02.2021) was only for 15,284 candidates. Thereafter, two additional Merit Lists with 478 and 738 candidates respectively were notified thereby taking the total count to 16,500. During the proceedings before the High Court, the learned Single Judge on 22.02.2021 passed an interim staying appointments from the Merit List notified on 15.02.2021. However, the Division Bench by its on 04.03.2021 declared that the Board is bound by the said Merit List dated 15.02.2021 and permitted appointments to be made to the 15,284 posts.
