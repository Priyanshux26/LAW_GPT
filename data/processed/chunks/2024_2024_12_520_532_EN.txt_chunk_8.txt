28. Further, Circular dated 25.05.2017 itself was the outcome of the of a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in Sanjeev Kumar Sharma (supra), wherein it was observed that the petitioners therein 3 Indu Shekhar Singh v State of Uttar Pradesh (2006) 8 SCC 129 532 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports be considered for promotion as there was no gap in service. In the case at hand, upon repatriation, there was no subsequent deputation of respondent no.1 to the appellant. Only after more than one year pursuant to taking part in a process for direct and regular recruitment to the post of Manager (Technical), respondent no.1 was appointed, with effect from 26.08.2015. Therefore, we have no doubt that the Circular dated 22.05.2017 would not confer any legal right on the respondent no.1 for consideration for promotion to the post of Deputy General Manager (Technical) with effect from 27.07.2017. 29. Accordingly, the Impugned dated 01.03.2023 as also CAT’s dated 30.12.2020 in O. A. No.310/01633/2020 cannot be sustained and are set aside. Resultantly, the said Original Application filed by the respondent no.1 shall stand dismissed. Respondent no.1 shall be considered for promotion(s) in terms of the Recruitment Regulations and the Circular and the discussions made in this and all consequential benefits of service (including pension etc., if and as applicable) shall be reckoned treating his date of entry into service of the appellant as 26.08.2015. However, no recovery/adjustment shall be made of excess payment(s) made to the respondent no.1, if any. 30. The appeal is allowed. 31. No as to cost. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
