Didwania v. ITO,82 K.C. Builders v. CIT 83 where the view taken was that when there is a categorical finding in the adjudication proceedings exonerating a person which is binding and conclusive, the prosecution cannot be allowed to 79 [2006] 2 SCR 709 : (2006) 4 SCC 278 80 AIR 1970 SC 962 81 (1982) 2 SCC 543 82 (1995) Supp(2) 724 83 [2004] 1 SCR 1134 : (2004) 2 SCC 731 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1219 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation stand, this Court summarized the ratio of the decisions in the following words: “38. The ratio which can be culled out from these decisions can broadly be stated as follows: (i) Adjudication proceedings and criminal prosecution can be launched simultaneously; (ii) Decision in adjudication proceedings is not necessary before initiating criminal prosecution; (iii) Adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are independent in nature to each other; (iv) The finding against the person facing prosecution in the adjudication proceedings is not binding on the proceeding for criminal prosecution; (v) Adjudication proceedings by the Enforcement Directorate is not prosecution by a competent court of law to attract the provisions of Article 20(2) of the Constitution or Section 300 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; (vi) The finding in the adjudication proceedings in favour of the person facing trial for identical violation will depend upon the nature of finding. If the exoneration in adjudication proceedings is on technical ground and not on merit, prosecution may continue; and (vii) In case of exoneration, however, on merits where the allegation is found to be not sustainable at all and the person held innocent, criminal prosecution on the same set of facts and circumstances cannot be allowed to continue, the underlying principle being the higher standard of proof in criminal cases. 39. In our opinion, therefore, the yardstick would be to judge as to whether the allegation in the adjudication proceedings as well as the proceeding for prosecution is identical and the exoneration of the person concerned in the adjudication proceedings is on merits. In case it is found on merit 1220 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports that there is no contravention of the provisions of the Act in the adjudication proceedings, the trial of the person concerned shall be an abuse of the process of the court.” [emphasis added] The aforesaid view also finds resonance in Ashoo Surendranath Tewari (supra) and J Sekar alias Sekar Reddy(supra). 10.2. We are of the view that if there was any breach of contract or default on the part of KECML, KPCL was well empowered to determine the lease. However, KPCL did not do so. Instead, on being confronted with the Audit Objections taken by CAG, it raised a demand on KECML for the value of the coal rejects. This demand was quashed and set aside by the Karnataka High Court and this Court. 10.3. On applying the decisions cited above to the facts of the instant case, this Court cannot turn a blind eye to the view taken in the judgement dated 24th March, 2016 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka in a dispute directly arising between KPCL and KECML pertaining to the very same cause of action based on the obligations cast on both the parties under various agreements executed for the development of captive coal blocks and for supply of coal, which was finally upheld by this Court vide judgement dated 20th May, 2022.
