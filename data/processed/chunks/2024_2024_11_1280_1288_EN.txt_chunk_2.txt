108 and 115 was reserved for Charokhar, Grass, Beed or Chara as per Nistar Patrak; and the respondent was not in possession of the said lands and leasehold right was not given to him by any settlement officer and no consent was also given in this regard, the State preferred Second Appeal No.2895 of 2019 along with an Interlocutory Application No. 13106 of 2019 seeking to condone the delay of 5 years 10 months and 16 days in filing the same. The High Court declined to condone the delay and dismissed the second appeal by the impugned herein. 4. Evidently, there was enormous delay occurred at every stage i.e., from the date of receipt of the passed by the First Appellate Court to till the date of filing the second appeal by the State. The judgement was passed by the First Appellate Court on 21.08.2014 and the same was communicated by the Government Advocate representing the State to the Collector, only on 25.08.2015 i.e., after a delay of one year. Causing 3 months’ delay, by letter dated 10.12.2015, the Collector informed to the Principal Secretary, Revenue Department, about the passing of the against the State and preferring a second appeal against the same. Thereafter, the Law Department took three years’ time and gave permission for filing appeal on 26.10.2018, which was sent to the Collector on 31.10.2018. Based on the said opinion, after preparation of the appeal papers, the State filed the second appeal only on 18.10.2019. Hence, there was inordinate delay of 1788 days occasioned in preferring the second appeal, but the same was not properly explained by the State. 5. The legal position is that where a case has been presented in the Court beyond limitation, the petitioner has to explain the Court as to what was the “sufficient cause” which means an adequate and enough reason which prevented him to approach the Court within 3 Hereinafter referred to as “the First Appellate Court” 1284 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports limitation. In Majji Sannemma v. Reddy Sridevi,4 it was held by this Court that even though limitation may harshly affect the rights of a party, it has to be applied with all its rigour when prescribed by statute. A reference was also made to the decision of this Court in Ajay Dabra v. Pyare Ram5 wherein, it was held as follows: “13. This Court in the case of Basawaraj v. Special Land Acquisition Officer [(2013) 14 SCC 81] while rejecting an application for condonation of delay for lack of sufficient cause has concluded in Paragraph 15 as follows: “15. The law on the issue can be summarised to the effect that where a case has been presented in the court beyond limitation, the applicant has to explain the court as to what was the “sufficient cause” which means an adequate and enough reason which prevented him to approach the court within limitation. In case a party is found to be negligent, or for want of bona fide on his part in the facts and circumstances of the case, or found to have not acted diligently or remained inactive, there cannot be a justified ground to condone the delay.
