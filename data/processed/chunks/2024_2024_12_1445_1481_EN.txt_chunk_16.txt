In this regard, we may quote the following paragraphs of the plaint: “34. The Plaintiff says that in Writ Petition No. 3813 of 1996 a Civil Application No. 1562 of 2006 came to be filed. One Advocate Shri. Godge had appeared in the said matter. The said Advocate is well acquainted with the Plaintiff. The said Advocate, after reading all the necessary related proceedings, informed the Plaintiff of the mischief committed by the Defendants. The Plaintiff thereafter collected all the necessary information and documents. The Plaintiff then instructed his Advocates to file the present suit. 35. The Plaintiff says that the present suit has been filed on the latest information received by the Plaintiff in respect of the lands in possession with the Defendants. The Plaintiff has accordingly described the suit properties in the schedule annexed as Exhibit “B” hereto. The Plaintiff craves leave of the Hon’ble Court to amend the plaint in 1468 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the event any other lands of the Plaintiff are detected and are found. The Plaintiff may also be permitted to amend the plaint and bring on record the parties in whose favour the Defendants may have created third party rights. 53. The Plaintiff states and submits that he got the knowledge of the proceedings on 2nd March 2007 only when he was informed about the Civil Application No. 1562 of 2006 in Writ Petition No. 3813 of 1996 filed by Dr. F. Wadia. The said knowledge gives cause of action for the Plaintiff to file suit. The knowledge that the Plaintiffs right in the suit Property have been affected by the proceedings between the Defendants and another the said day i.e. 2nd March 2007 is the date as prescribed by law for the limitation to start, as he first got the knowledge then. The Plaintiff has thereafter collected all the information and approached this Hon’ble Court as soon as possible. There is much more information that the Plaintiff awaits in respect of the land in Village Yerwada. The Plaintiff is also filing· a separate application under 2 Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Code reserving right to seek other additional reliefs against the Defendants”. On a reading of the plaint averments, it is clear that the plaintiff was well acquainted with the counsel Mr.Godge. If the plaintiff was already acquainted with Mr. Godge, whom upon verification of the records from the status of the suit, we find to have entered appearance in the suit for the 20th Respondent on 21.07.2005 itself, would have acquired knowledge much prior to 2nd March 2007. We also find that Civil Application No 1562 of 2006 was not filed by Mr.Godge. Therefore, it is a clear case where the plaintiff has not approached the Court with clean hands. We have no hesitation to hold that the 2nd March 2007, is a fictional date, created only for the purpose of this suit. As such, the in T.Arivanandam v. T.V.Satyapal23 squarely becomes applicable. 18. Continuing further with the plea of limitation, the Courts below have held that the question of the suit being barred by limitation can be decided at the time of trial as the question of limitation is a mixed 23 (1977) 4 SCC 467 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
