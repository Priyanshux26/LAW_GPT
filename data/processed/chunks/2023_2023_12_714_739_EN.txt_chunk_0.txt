Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Compliance of s.19 of the Act – Proper or not: Held: The remand dated 15.06.2023 passed by the Vacation Judge/Additional Sessions Judge reflects total failure on his part in discharging his duty as per the expected standard – The Judge did not even record a fi nding that he perused the grounds of arrest to ascertain whether the ED had recorded reasons to believe that the appellants were guilty of an off ence under the Act of 2002 and that there was proper compliance with the mandate of s.19 of the Act of 2002 – He merely stated that, keeping in view the seriousness of the off ences and the stage of the investigation, he was convinced that custodial interrogation of the accused persons was required in the present case and remanded them to the custody of the ED – Analyzing the arrest of the appellants, neither of the appellants was shown as accused in the fi rst ECIR registered by the ED – Both the appellants secured interim protection by way of anticipatory bail from the High Court – However, both the appellants were summoned on 14.06.2023 for interrogation in connection with the fi rst ECIR and summons were served on 13.06.2023 – Signifi cantly, second ECIR was recorded on 13.06.2023 in connection with 714 PANKAJ BANSAL v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 715 FIR No.0006 which was registered on 17.04.2023 – Therein also, neither of the appellants were shown as accused and only one ‘RB’ was shown as accused – Both appellants had presented themselves at the ED’s offi ce – Thereafter, both appellants were arrested in connection with the second ECIR, were in exercise of power u/s. 19(1) of the Act of 2002 – It was alleged that both appellants failed to respond to the questions put by ED – Mere non-cooperation of a witness in response to the summons issued u/s. 50 of the Act of 2002 would not be enough to render him/her liable to be arrested u/s. 19 – In any event, it is not open to the ED to expect an admission of guilt from the person summoned for interrogation and assert that anything short of such admission would be an ‘evasive reply’ – Also, it is the admitted position is that the ED’s Investigating Offi cer merely read out or permitted reading of the grounds of arrest of the appellants and left it at that, which is also disputed by the appellants – As this form of communication is not found to be adequate to fulfi l compliance with the mandate of Art.
