[Para 38] Franchise agreement and distributorship agreement – Distinction – Legal position of a distributor different from agent – Distributor, an independent contractor: Held: Legal position of a distributor, it is to be generally regarded as different from that of an agent – The distributor buys goods on his account and sells them in his territory – In such cases, distributor is an independent contractor – Unlike an agent, he does not act as a communicator or creator of a relationship between the principal and a third party – Franchise agreements are normally considered as sui generis, though they have been in existence for some time – They provide a mechanism whereby goods and services may be distributed – In franchise agreements, the supplier or the manufacture, i.e. a franchisor, appoints an independent enterprise as a franchisee through whom the franchisor supplies certain goods or services – There is a close relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee because a franchisee’s operations are closely regulated, and this possibly is a distinction between a franchise agreement and a [2024] 2 S.C.R. 1005 Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v.
