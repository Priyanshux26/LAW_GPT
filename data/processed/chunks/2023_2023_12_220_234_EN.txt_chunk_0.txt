Accused nos. 1, 5 and 13 were acquitted in appeal by the Supreme Court. (a) Whether conviction of appellant-accused no.6 justifi ed; (b) Whether conviction of accused no. 2, 3, 4 was justifi ed, when role ascribed to them was that they were part of mob. Evidence – Conviction of appellant-accused no.6 based on sole testimony of PW-2 – Propriety: Held: Considering the nature of the testimony of PW-2, it cannot be said that the evidence of PW-2 is wholly reliable – The identifi cation of the appellant for the fi rst time in the Court after a lapse of about two years becomes doubtful for more than one reason – Firstly, the appellant was not known to PW-2 – Secondly, the appellant was part of a large aggressive mob of 50 to 100 people which surrounded the auto- rickshaw – Thirdly, there was no identifi cation parade held – Fourthly, there was no time available to PW-2 to note the distinctive features of the appellant – Hence, it is very unsafe to record a conclusion based only on the testimony of the solitary witness that the guilt of the appellant was proved beyond a reasonable doubt – Even if the evidence of PW-2 is categorized as “neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable,” the appellant cannot be convicted only based on the sole testimony of PW-2 unless there is a corroboration to the version of PW-2 either by 220 JAVED SHAUKAT ALI QURESHI v. STATE OF GUJARAT 221 direct or circumstantial evidence – Such a corroboration is completely absent in this case – Therefore, the conviction of the appellant cannot be sustained. [Para 8] Penal Code, 1860 – Conviction of accused nos. 2, 3, 4 – Propriety: Held: The conviction of accused nos. 1, 5 and 13 was based only on the testimony of PW-25 and PW-26 – The Supreme Court had in its earlier decision rejected the testimony of PW-25 and PW-26 in its entirety – Assuming that PW-25 and PW-26 identifi ed accused nos.2, 3 and 4 by stating that they were members of the mob; once a Coordinate Bench of the Supreme Court discards their testimony in its entirety being unreliable, the benefi t of the said fi nding will have to be extended to the accused nos.2, 3, and 4 as they are similarly placed with accused nos.1,5 and 13 – Therefore, the conviction of accused nos.2, 3 and 4 set aside. [Paras 11, 12 and 14] Evidence – Similar or identical evidence of eyewitnesses against accused persons – Principle of parity: Held: When there is similar or identical evidence of eyewitnesses against two accused by ascribing them the same or similar role, the Court cannot convict one accused and acquit the other – In such a case, the cases of both the accused will be governed by the principle of parity – This principle means that the Criminal Court should decide like cases alike, and in such cases, the Court cannot make a distinction between the two accused, which will amount to discrimination.
