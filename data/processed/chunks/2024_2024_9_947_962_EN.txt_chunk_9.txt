1’s authority to act on behalf of his sisters. 16. In our considered opinion, the High Court erred in its assessment of the authority of Defendant No. 1 to bind Defendant Nos. 6 to 8. While it is legally permissible for an agent to bind a principal even if the agency relationship is not disclosed, this principle applies when the agent has valid and subsisting authority. In the present case, the GPA was executed in 1982 and was unregistered. The subsequent registered partition deed in 1988 allocated specific shares to each co-owner and delineated their rights and authorities. Moreover, The partition deed dated 17.02.1988 impliedly revoked any prior authority granted under the GPA concerning the sale of the property. By specifying that Defendant No. 1 was authorized only to collect rent, it limited his authority and implicitly withdrew any broader powers previously granted. It must be emphasized that the agreement dated 06.06.1993 did not mention the GPA or indicate that Defendant No. 1 was acting on behalf of his sisters. He signed the agreement solely in his capacity, and there was no representation made to the plaintiffs that he had the authority to bind the sisters. This omission is significant, as the plaintiffs were aware that the sisters’ consent was essential, which is evident from the agreement’s stipulation that the sisters would come to execute the sale deed within three months. 960 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 17. The plaintiffs were cognizant of the fact that Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 were not parties to the agreement and that their willingness and participation were necessary for a valid sale. This is further corroborated by the plaintiffs’ own admissions that they were assured by Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra that the sisters would be brought to execute the sale deed. Thus, the plaintiffs cannot claim that they believed Defendant No. 1 had the authority to bind the sisters without their explicit consent. The appellants have rightly pointed out that an agent’s authority must be explicit, and any limitations or revocations thereof must be given due consideration. In the absence of a valid and subsisting power of attorney authorizing Defendant No. 1 to sell the property on behalf of Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, the agreement cannot be enforced against them. 18. In view of the above, we hold that Defendant No. 1 lacked the authority to bind Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 in the agreement to sell dated 06.06.1993. The General Power of Attorney did not confer upon him the power to sell the property on behalf of his sisters at the time of the agreement, having been impliedly revoked by the partition deed. The agreement was, therefore, incomplete and unenforceable against Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, who collectively held a majority share in the property. The plaintiffs’ knowledge of the necessity of obtaining the sisters’ consent, coupled with their failure to secure such consent, renders the agreement ineffective against Defendant Nos. 6 to 8. Consequently, the agreement cannot be specifically enforced against them, and the plaintiffs cannot claim any right over their shares in the property based on the said agreement.
