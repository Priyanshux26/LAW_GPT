A 01.01.1996. Arrears were made payable, based on that fitment and fixation, with effect from 01.01.2006. Another significant fact is that interim relief had been directed and was made payable, to all employees, between 01.01.1996 and 29.03.2010, and it was not to be recovered. This demonstrates that those who retired B between these dates, and those who continued in service, form part of the same class. Further, there is also no distinction between those in service as on 01.01.2006 but retired before 29.03.2010, and those who continued thereafter. [Para 30-31][1188-E, H; 1189- A-B] C 1.5 The question is whether the classification, excluding employees who retired before 29.03.2010 and confining pay revision benefits (albeit with effect from 01.01.2006) results in discrimination. This court has struck down such instances in the past: a condition making only graduates among those holding D post of forest guard, eligible for a limited departmental exam, amounted to creating a class within a class, which is impermissible (Maharashtra Forest Guards & Foresters Union v. State of Maharashtra); denying pay revisions to those teachers who had retired during a specified period (i.e., discrimination on the basis E of date of retirement) was arbitrary, as it resulted in discrimination between teachers working in government colleges and in non- governmental colleges which would mean treating equals unequally (U.P. Raghavendra Acharya &Ors. v. State of Karnataka &Ors. ); classification caused by formula of pension whereby those F retiring before a cut-off date were given lower rate of revised pension, as compared to those retiring later held to be discriminatory (All Manipur Pensioners Association by its Secretary v. State of Manipur &Ors.). [Para 32-35][1189-C-D; 1190-E-F; 1192-A-B] G State of J&K v. Triloki Nath Khosa [1974] 1 SCR 771: (1974) 1 SCC 19; Maharashtra Forest Guards & Foresters Union v. State of Maharashtra [2017] 14 SCR 446 : (2018) 1 SCC 149; U.P. Raghavendra Acharya & Ors. v. State of Karnataka & Ors. [2006] 2 Suppl. H SCR 582: (2006) 9 SCC 630; All Manipur Pensioners MAHARASHTRA STATE FINANCIAL CORP. EX- EMPLOYEES 1173 ASSOC. v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA Association by its Secretary v. State of Manipur & Ors. A [2019] 9 SCR 905 : (2020) 14 SCC 625 – relied on. 1.6 In the present case the employees who retired prior to 29.03.2010 discharged the same duties as in the case of those who did thereafter. The quality and content of responsibilities B assigned to them were the same. The respondents’ decision not to grant arrears prior to 01.01.2006 cannot be found fault with; however, not to grant any revision to those who were not in service when the implementing the pay revision was issued and confining it to those, in employment is clearly discriminatory. C The rationale that granting such pay revision only to existing employees would be to enthuse them to recover NPA amounts payable to MSFC has no rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the pay revision, which is to benefit employees and protect them from the rise in the cost of living.
