Digital Supreme Court Reports on 30th January 2024 by the Ministry of Home Affairs, holding that Pranav was not a person of Indian origin in terms of Section 5 of the 1955 Act. Therefore, he was not eligible for a grant of Indian citizenship under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act. Being aggrieved, Pranav has filed Writ Petition (C) No. 123 of 2024 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. SUBMISSIONS 5. Mr C S Vaidyanathan, the learned senior counsel appearing for Pranav, submitted that within three months of attaining majority, on 5th May 2017, Pranav declared his intention to resume Indian citizenship by filing the application in Form XXV with the Consulate Office (Consulate General of India, New York, USA). He was administered the oath of allegiance to the Constitution of India on the date of filing the application. The submission of the learned senior counsel, in short, is that apart from the fact that Pranav was entitled to resume his Indian citizenship by invoking Section 8(2) of the 1955 Act, he is deemed to be an Indian citizen under Article 8 of the Constitution of India by virtue of his grandparents’ birth in undivided India. Moreover, he was entitled to seek Indian citizenship under Section 5(1)(b) of the 1955 Act. 6. The learned senior counsel invited our attention to Articles 5 and 6 of the Constitution, which specifically use the expression “at the commencement of this Constitution.” In contrast, Article 8 uses the expression “whether before or after commencement of the Constitution of India”. Therefore, Article 8, as opposed to Articles 5 and 6, applies even after the commencement of the Constitution. He submitted that by the language used in Section 5 of the 1955 Act, it is crystal clear that a person can acquire Indian citizenship either by virtue of constitutional provisions or by taking recourse to the 1955 Act.
