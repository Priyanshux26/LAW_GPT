14. In this case, the High Court observed that the appellant’s income, primarily from employment and investments, demonstrated his ability to provide for the wife and child’s maintenance adequately. The evidence revealed that the appellant earned over ₹4,00,000 (Rupees four lakhs only) per month between 2007 and 2016. Although he claimed higher living expenses due to his residence in Mauritius, the High Court found his arguments to be unsubstantiated, as his financial resources allowed him to meet maintenance obligations without undue hardship. The High Court further noted several instances of the appellant’s deliberate attempts to mislead the judicial process. He withheld critical financial documents and selectively disclosed information to conceal the full extent of his wealth. The inquiry into the statutory forms of the appellant revealed that he had investments in mutual funds valued at ₹5.10 crores as early as 2009-2010, significant sums deposited in bank accounts, and other financial transactions that were not initially disclosed. 15. The High Court also identified false representations by the appellant regarding his property and income. He denied ownership of a property located at F-146, Richmond Park, Gurgaon, despite evidence of its ownership and rental income accruing to him. Additionally, the appellant misrepresented his association with Prasham Consultants LLP, wherein he continued to receive financial benefits until his father replaced him in 2016. These findings demonstrated a pattern of deliberate suppression of material facts and assets by the appellant, aimed at minimizing his maintenance liability. Such conduct warranted judicial intervention to ensure justice and provide adequate financial support to the wife and child, reflecting principles of fairness, transparency, and equity. Consequently, the High Court directed the [2024] 12 S.C.R. 551 Parvin Kumar Jain v. Anju Jain appellant to pay interim maintenance that adequately addressed the needs of the wife and child, proportionate to his financial capacity and consistent with the obligations of a responsible spouse and parent. 16. Consequently, the High Court dismissed the appellant’s appeal challenging the of interim maintenance granted by the Family Court, and, while allowing the respondent’s appeal, granted the following relief: i. MAT.APP. (F.C) 120/2019 filed by the wife is allowed to the extent that the interim maintenance granted to the wife under Section 24 of the HMA is enhanced from Rs. 1,15,000/- (Rupees one lakh fifteen thousand only) to Rs. 1,45,000/- (Rupees on lakh forty five thousand only) per month from the date of filing of enhancement application i.e. 28.02.2009 till the date of withdrawal of divorce petition by the appellant i.e. 14.07.2016. ii. All amounts paid by the appellant to the wife and the son till date shall be duly adjusted. iii. The appellant shall also be liable to pay interest at the rate of 12% per annum towards the shortfall in the maintenance amount for the concerned period. The interest shall be calculated on the amount of deficit from the time it became due in a particular month and till the time it is paid. iv. Based on the aforesaid, the arrears of maintenance to both the wife and the son, along with the interest, shall be paid within a period of eight (8) weeks from today.
