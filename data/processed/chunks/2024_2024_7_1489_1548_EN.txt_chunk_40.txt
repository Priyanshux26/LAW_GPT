In Rashid Ahmed v. Municipal Board, Kairana,108 a Constitution Bench of was called upon to decide the validity of bye-laws framed by the Municipal Board. Bye-law 2 provided that no person could establish any new market or place for wholesale transactions without the previous permission of the Municipal Board. Justice S R Das (as the learned Chief Justice then was), speaking for the Constitution Bench, held: “11. The Constitution by Article 19(1) guarantees to the Indian citizen the right to carry on trade or business subject to such reasonable restrictions as are mentioned in clause (6) of that article. The position, however, under Bye-law 2 is that while it provided that no person shall establish a market for wholesale transactions in vegetables except with the permission of the Board, there is no bye-law authorising the respondent Board to issue the licence. The net result 105 Jamshed Ansari v. High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (2016) 10 SCC 554 [17] 106 N K Bajpai (supra) [25] 107 [1950] 1 SCR 759 : 1950 SCC 695 108 [1950] 1 SCR 566 : 1950 SCC 221 1544 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports is that the prohibition of this bye-law, in the absence of any provision for issuing licence, becomes absolute.” 98. In Mohammad Yasin v. Town Area Committee, Jalalabad,109 a Constitution Bench of this Court was called upon to determine the validity of the bye-laws framed by the Town Area Committee imposing licence fees on any person intending to sell in wholesale at any place in the town area. The issue before this Court was whether the Committee had legal authority to impose the fees. Justice S R Das (as the learned Chief Justice then was) observed that a “licence fee on a business not only takes away the property of the licensee but also operates as a restriction on his right to carry on his business, for without the payment of such fee the business cannot be carried on at all.” It was held that the restriction on the fundament right under Article 19(1)(g) can be imposed by the State according to Article 19(6). It was held that an illegal impost is an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on occupation, trade or business under Article 19(1)(g): “12. […] If, therefore, the licence fee cannot be justified on the basis of any valid law no question of its reasonableness can arise, for an illegal impost must at all times be an unreasonable restriction and will necessarily infringe the right of the citizen to carry on his occupation, trade or business under Article 19(1)(g) and such infringement can properly be made the subject-matter of a challenge under Article 32 of the Constitution.” 99. In Mohammad Yasin (supra), the United Provinces Town Areas Act 1914 empowered the Town Area Committee to charge fees for the use or occupation of any immoveable property vested in or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee, including any public street or place. It was held that this power did not include the power to levy licence fees on a person intending to sell in wholesale at any place in the town area.
