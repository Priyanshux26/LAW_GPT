3. The FIR was registered as Crime No. 401 of 2018 under Sections 376 and 506 IPC. 4. Police carried out the investigation during the course of which statement of the prosecutrix under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr.P.C.) was recorded on 11.09.2018. That apart, statement of the prosecutrix was also recorded on 12.09.2018 under Section 164 Cr.P.C. On completion of the investigation, chargesheet was filed against the appellant under Sections 376 and 506 of IPC. 5. Appellant filed an application under Section 227 Cr.P.C. before the Sessions Judge seeking his discharge. By the dated 24.04.2019, the Sessions Judge took the view that prima-facie the chargesheet discloses sufficient evidence to frame charge against the appellant. In such circumstances, the accused (appellant) could not be discharged from the trial for the offences under Sections 376 and 506 of IPC. Consequently, the application filed by the appellant under Section 227 Cr.P.C. was dismissed. 6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid of the Sessions Judge, appellant filed a criminal revision petition under Section 397 Cr.P.C. The said petition was registered as Criminal Revision No. 2288 of 2019. By the and dated 03.10.2019, the High Court took the view that trial needs to be conducted for unearthing the truth and that no case for interference was made out. Consequently, the criminal revision petition was dismissed. 7. Assailing the aforesaid decision of the High Court, appellant preferred Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 11671 of 2019 before this Court. By dated 07.01.2020, this Court issued notice and passed an interim staying further proceedings in Sessions Trial No. 505 of 2018 pending before the Sessions Judge. Subsequently by dated 12.05.2023, this Court granted leave and directed continuance of the interim during the pendency of the criminal appeal, which came to be registered as Criminal Appeal No. 1552 of 2023. 8. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the relationship between the appellant and the prosecutrix was purely consensual. Therefore, there is no question of any offence committed by the 12 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports appellant either under Section 376 IPC or under Section 506 IPC. A bare reading of the FIR and the chargesheet would go to show that there is no criminal element involved in the case. Therefore, it would be contrary to the principles of justice if the appellant is made to suffer the ordeal of a long-drawn criminal trial and in the process suffer ignominy which would have irreparable consequences. This aspect of the matter was overlooked by the Sessions Judge as well as by the High Court. He, therefore, seeks quashing of the s passed by the Sessions Judge and the High Court and further to quash the proceedings in Sessions Trial No. 505 of 2018 pending before the Sessions Judge. 9. Learned counsel for respondent No. 1 on the other hand submits that on the information of the prosecutrix, police registered FIR under Sections 376 and 506 IPC against the accused (appellant). Police investigated the case and collected materials.
