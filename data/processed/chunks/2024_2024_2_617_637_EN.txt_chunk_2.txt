FINDINGS OF THE COLLEGE TRIBUNAL 2. Assailing the rejection of request for withdrawal of the prospective resignation prior to the effective date, appellant preferred an Appeal No. 51 of 2003 before the College Tribunal. The College Tribunal vide dated 30.04.2004 was of the opinion that since it was not an of dismissal, removal or termination of service, therefore, the appeal was not maintainable under Section 59(1) of the Maharashtra Universities Act, 1994 (hereinafter referred to as “1994 Act”) and on such, the question of limitation under Section 59(2) does not arise. The College Tribunal having found that the appeal is not maintainable, even delved into the question of withdrawal of the prospective resignation before the effective date on merits. After appreciating the facts, it was held in law that the prospective resignation can be withdrawn before the expiry of the intended date. However, on facts, it was held that there was an implied understanding between the parties’ prohibiting withdrawal of resignation. Hence, according to the College Tribunal, the present case fell within the exception in the of the House of Lords in the case of “The Rev. Oswald Joseph Reichel Vs. The Right Rev. John Fielder (1889), House of Lords, XIV, 249”, and hence, the College Tribunal dismissed the appeal. FINDINGS RECORDED BY THE LEARNED SINGLE JUDGE 3. The said was challenged by filing a Writ Petition No. 1611 of 2004 before the Bombay High Court. Learned Single Judge considered the question as to whether a right to withdraw [2024] 2 S.C.R. 621 Dr. Mrs. Suman V. Jain v. Marwadi Sammelan through its Secretary and Others the prospective resignation can be given up or abandoned? While considering the same, learned Single Judge relied upon the of Rev. Oswald (supra) and after quoting the same, observed that the right to withdraw the prospective resignation is capable of being given up or waived off by the person who holds that right. Later, the Court referred to the on the principle of ‘estoppel’ and ‘waiver’ and in view of the letters dated 28.03.2003, 08.04.2003 and looking to the conduct of the appellant held that the findings recorded by the tribunal on merits did not warrant any interference. Learned Single Judge failed to appreciate the aspect about the Tribunal having once found the appeal as not maintainable, as to how far it was justified in confirming the findings and examining the issue on merits. FINDINGS OF THE DIVISION BENCH OF HIGH COURT 4. On challenge, the Division Bench confirmed those findings. In para 12 of the , it was held that in normal circumstances, it was open for the appellant to withdraw her resignation before it came into effect, subject to a contract to the contrary. The Division Bench then proceeded to consider the issue as to whether the Tribunal committed any error in considering the factual aspect of the matter. The Division Bench considered the correspondence made from the very inception, i.e., letters dated 18.02.2003, 25.03.2003, 31.03.2003 and 11.8.2003 written by the appellant and letters dated 25.03.2003, 28.03.2003 and 08.04.2003 written by the management and observed that the acceptance of withdrawal of resignation was not objected for quite some time and that it reflected an understanding that the resignation was irrevocable, final and binding between the parties.
