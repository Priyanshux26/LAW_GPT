35 Neelima Srivastava v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 2021 SCC Online SC 610, para 30. 36 R. Unnikrishnan v. V.K. Mahanudevan (2014) 4 SCC 434, para 19-23. 1250 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports as well as all other cases relying on them, it only overruled their precedential value, and did not reopen the lis between the parties. The mere fact that the impugned s in the present case were overruled by Manoharlal (supra) would not, therefore, be a sufficient ground to argue that the cases should be reopened. 30. In this respect, it would be pertinent to highlight an exception—cases that are still pending before this Court. If the lis is still pending and has not reached finality, those cases would be decided on the basis of Manoharlal (supra). This is because a decision on the interpretation of law is applied retrospectively unless the court specifically rules as to its prospective applicability. 31. There can, however, be no doubt that a lis will have to be decided as per the new interpretation if during its pendency, the law has been construed in a different manner by a subsequent judgement. We say so for the reason that such new construction shall be deemed to be the correct understanding of the statute from its very inception. We find support in this regard from Shyam Madan Mohan Ruia v. Messer Holdings Ltd.,37 in which the High Court had dismissed the suit based on the decision of this Court in Foreshore Coop. Housing Society Ltd. v. Praveen D. Desai.38 During the pendency of appeal, Foreshore Coop. Housing Society Ltd. (supra) was overruled in the case of Nusli Neville Wadia v. Ivory Properties.39 This Court while deciding the issue in Shyam Mohan Ruia (supra), held that since the precedent forming the very basis of the High Court’s decision stood overruled, the dispute before it must be decided as per the later decision. 32. To sum up, we hold that subsequent change of law will not be attracted unless a case is pending before the competent court awaiting its final adjudication. To say it differently, if a case has already been decided, it cannot be re-opened and re-decided solely on the basis of a new interpretation given to that law. D.3. Leeway to be granted to government entities 33. The appellants have vehemently contended that the government entities ought to be allowed leeway for condonation of delay. For 37 [2019] 15 SCR 396 : (2020) 5 SCC 252, para 18. 38 [2015] 5 SCR 1075 : (2015) 6 SCC 412 39 [2019] 15 SCR 795 : (2020) 6 SCC 557 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1251 Delhi Development Authority v. Tejpal & Ors. this, the appellants placed reliance on Collector (LA) (supra) and G. Ramegowda (supra) which held that courts ought to be generous while considering delay on the part of government entities given factors unique to them like the impersonal nature of their functioning, inherited bureaucratic methodology, and procedural red-tapeism. 34. However, with time, the position of law held in these cases has been diluted.
