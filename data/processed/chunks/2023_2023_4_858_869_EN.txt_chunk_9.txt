PUNJAB AND SIND BANK v. FRONTLINE CORPORATION 869 LTD. [B. R. GAVAI, J.] 18. Undisputedly, in the present case, while vacating the interim A relief granted vide dated 15th July 2013, the Single Judge had held that the relief claimed by the plaintiff could not have been granted in view of the provisions of Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act. As such, the Single Judge had passed the said on the basis of a statutory bar. As observed earlier, the scope in which a civil suit is maintainable as B determined by this Court in the case of Mardia Chemicals Limited (supra) is very limited. The case of the respondent/plaintiff would not come within the said limited scope. As such, we are of the considered view that the Division Bench has grossly erred in interfering with the discretion exercised by the Single Judge. C 19. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The and dated 30th January 2017 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is quashed and set aside and the and passed by the learned Single Judge is upheld. 20. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. D Ankit Gyan Appeal allowed. E F G H
