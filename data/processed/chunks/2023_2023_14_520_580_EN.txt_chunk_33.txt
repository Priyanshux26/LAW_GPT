45. It may also be noted that from the submissions made before us, it appears that proceedings for acquisition were initiated under Section 52(2) of the 1959 Act in the year 1972 and, thereafter, in the year 1974, notifi cation under sub-section (1) of Section 52 was published. The plaintiff and defendant nos.2 to 4 neither claim that they were recorded in the record of rights prior to that, nor do they claim that none of the recorded owners was served with notice. Importantly, the plaintiff does not dispute publication of notifi cation under sub-section (1) of Section 52 of the 1959 Act. In fact, plaintiff ’s claim is that he along with defendant nos. 2 to 4 were owners of the land, pursuant to sale-deeds of the year 1970, yet they were not served notice, under sub-section (2) of Section 52, prior to the notifi cation under sub-section (1) of Section 52 and, therefore, the notifi cation, under sub- section (1) of Section 52, is illegal and void. 46. In Ahuja Industries (supra), a somewhat similar claim under another land acquisition law was rejected. In that case, the appellant who fi led the appeal before this Court had purchased a piece of land on 10.02.1993. However, the said land was not mutated in his name in the record of rights which continued to show the name of the person who had sold the land to the vendor of the appellant. Subsequently, the said land and surrounding lands were acquired vide notifi cation dated 30.10.1997. The appellant questioned the acquisition, by claiming, inter alia, that no notice under Section 28(2) and 28(6) of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966 was served on him and that such violation of principle of natural justice vitiated the acquisition proceedings. It was also argued that Sections 127, 128 and 129 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 cast an obligation on the Registering Offi cer to make a report to the revenue authority to enter his name in the record of rights and its failure to do so resulting in non-service of the notice on the appellant, depriving him of the opportunity to fi le his objections, should not act to his detriment or disadvantage. 566 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. 47. Dealing with the above submissions, in Ahuja Industries (supra), upon fi nding that notices were issued to/served on the owners/occupants, or their representatives, as shown in the record of rights, and the appellant had not got his name mutated in the record of rights, this Court, after taking notice of earlier decisions, held: “12. This Court in Winky Dilawari v. Amritsar Improvement Trust [(1996) 11 SCC 644] has taken the view that failure to serve personal notices on the persons whose names have not been mutated in the offi cial record-of-rights in pursuance of any sale in their favour does not vitiate the proceedings for acquisition. Similar view was taken in W.B. Housing Board v. Brijendra Prasad Gupta [(1997) 6 SCC 207] wherein this Court observed: (SCC p. 214, para 8): “It is no part of the duty of the Collector to make a roving inquiry into ownership of the persons.
