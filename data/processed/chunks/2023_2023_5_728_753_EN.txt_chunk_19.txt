This has been set aside B as noticed by us by the ADJ and the matters stood remanded back by dated 01.08.2017. This was not challenged by the appellants. It is thereafter that the courts have concurrently found that there was non-compliance of Section 17. The earlier of the High court dated 03.12.2015 has been overcome by finding that there was a sweeping C statement before the High Court in the earlier round that the surety furnished had been accepted. The High Court further finds that actually the prayer made in application dated 12.05.2014 was only to take the surety on record. The dated 25.04.2014 only shows that only the surety was taken on record. It is further found that the application dated 12.05.2014 was filed after 06.05.2014 and could not be the basis for a D valid under Section 17. 26. We are in agreement with the courts that the security furnished by the appellants in the form of the rented shop belonging to a third party cannot be accepted as security in law. It is patent. It is not clear from the dated 24.05.2014 that the Court had applied its mind to the E sufficiency of the security or as to whether it was acceptable security. If security is given, which is later found to be unacceptable even if it is within 30 days within the meaning of Article 123 of the Limitation Act, then it would not be complying with Section 17 [see the observations of the full Bench of the Allahabad High court in Ram Bharose (supra)]. F 27. While it is true that there may have been a failure on the part of the court to pass s on the application dated 06.05.2014 apparently, the appellants proceeded to furnish the security in this case on 12.05.2014. Therefore, we proceed on the basis that within 30 days of the date of knowledge of the decree, as alleged by the appellants, but after the date G of the application under IX Rule 13, the appellants have furnished security. We are mindful of the fact that no was passed by the Court on 06.05.2014. Even proceeding to consider the security however we would find that it is clearly unacceptable in law. The effect of the of the High Court dated 03.12.2015 must be understood with reference to the concession made by the counsel and may not withstand H ARTI DIXIT & ANR v. SUSHIL KUMAR MISHRA & ORS 753 [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] the requirement of law under Section 17 of the Act being fulfilled. We A cannot be unmindful of the fact that the appellants did not challenge the of the Additional District Judge dated 01.08.2017. The trial Judge was bound by the same as the appellants did not challenge the dated 01.08.2017. The fact that the appellants, after participating in the remanded proceedings mounted a challenge in a writ to the dated B 01.08.2017 appears to us as not advancing the case of the appellants. This is both for the reason of the belated challenge as also the nature of the earlier involved.
