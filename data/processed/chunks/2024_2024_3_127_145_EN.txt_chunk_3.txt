The opposite party claimed that the complaint was time-barred and sought its dismissal with compensatory costs of Rs.10,000/-. 2.6 The District Consumer Forum at Kolhapur, vide dated 16.10.2006, on perusal of various supporting documents, including the Development Agreement, building plans, notices, replies, certificates, estimates, receipts and affidavits partly allowed the Consumer Complaint No.184 of 2005 filed against the opposite party. The District Forum observed that as per the Development Agreement between the parties, the transaction between the parties was not one of sale and purchase of property but of development of property. Since the services regarding construction are covered by the Consumer Protection Act, the dispute was held to be a consumer dispute. Further, the District Forum refused to take into consideration the points raised by the complainants regarding defects in construction, amenities and facilities due to lack of evidence provided in that regard. However, the opposite party was found to be liable to pay to the complainants an amount of Rs. l,65,000/- along with interest at the rate of 18% per annum with effect from 01.05.1997 till payment; an amount of Rs. 1,85,000/- along with interest at the rate of 18% per annum with effect from 31.08.1997 till payment; and an amount of Rs.1,50,000/- at the time of conveyance. 2.7 Both the parties challenged the of the District Forum before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra State, Mumbai (for short, “the State Commission”). The State Commission, vide its common dated 08.04.2008 in First Appeal Nos.2570 of 2006 and 1115 of 2007, partly modified the of the District Forum by setting aside the directions to pay Rs. 1.85 lakhs and Rs. 1.65 lakhs as the said claims were held to be time-barred but upheld the direction to pay Rs. 1.5 lakhs. However, the State Commission placed reliance on some other clauses of the Development Agreement such as clause 4(k), to hold that the building was incomplete and that the opposite party was liable to get the construction of the [2024] 3 S.C.R. 133 Vinayak Purshottam Dube (Deceased), Through Lrs v. Jayashree Padamkar Bhat & Others compound wall and give separate access in terms of Schedule-II of the Development Agreement. The opposite party was further directed to obtain and handover the Completion Certificate to the complainants; to execute the Conveyance Deed and to give electricity connections to the complainants for which they had already paid Rs.15,000/- to the developer-opposite party. 2.8 The complainants as well as the opposite party approached the NCDRC by filing Revision Petition Nos.3283 of 2008 and 2794 of 2008. During the pendency of the petition before the NCDRC, the original opposite party-Vinayak Purushottam Dube died and his legal representatives i.e., his wife and two sons were brought on record, who are the appellants before this Court. The NCDRC, vide dated 31.05.2016, again partly modified the of the State Commission. The NCDRC disagreed with the finding and conclusion of the State Commission with respect to the time-barred transaction of Rs. 1.85 lakhs and Rs. 1.65 lakhs, by observing that the limitation of the said claims had to be adjudged by looking at the transaction between the parties as a whole, which established a continuous cause of action in the matter.
