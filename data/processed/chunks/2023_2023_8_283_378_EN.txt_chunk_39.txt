Though we may not go to that extent, we would certainly hold that, (i) what was a simple suit for partition; and (ii) the incidental finding recorded that the properties were Mathurka properties, have been used B by parties and non-parties to assert title to the properties against strangers. This was definitely an abuse of the process of law. 124. There are two more aspects which highlight the abuse of the process of law in this case. They are as follows: (i) The preliminary decree for partition was passed on C 28.06.1963; the Executing Court passed an on 29.03.1996 in E.P. No. 3 of 1996 directing the Bailiff of the Court to deliver possession of the land in Survey No. 172 of Hydernagar to the decree holder; and thereafter a final decree was passed in Application No. 517 of 1998 on D 24.04.1998. Normally a final decree follows a preliminary decree and execution follows the final decree. But strangely, the final decree followed execution, in this case. (ii) The passed by the Executing Court on 29.03.1996 in E.P. No. 3 of 1996 directing the Bailiff of the Court to deliver E possession of the land in Survey No. 172 of Hydernagar was a specimen of a unique kind. It may be recalled that an application was taken out by the Receiver-cum- Commissioner way back in 1973, in Application No. 19 of 1973, praying for a direction to the Collector to hand over possession of the lands in Survey Nos. 145, 163 and 172 of F Hydernagar. On this application, the High Court passed an on 05.07.1974, directing the Government to hand over symbolic possession of the lands situate in Survey Nos. 145 and 163 of Hydernagar village measuring acres 220 guntas 18 and acres 175 guntas 6 respectively to the Receiver. But insofar as other lands were concerned (i.e., Survey G No. 172), the Court recorded in its dated 05.07.1974 that the Government was not even in a position to hand over symbolic possession and that therefore it is for the Receiver-cum-Commissioner to take such steps as are available in law. In other words, even symbolic possession H 344 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A of the land in Survey No. 172 was not possible in the year 1974, but actual possession became possible in the year 1996 after the decrees were sold by way of assignments. We do not know what magic was played by Goldstone, like a philosopher’s stone16, to make this miracle possible. B 125. It is on record that taking advantage of the finding rendered in the and preliminary decree dated 28.06.1963, several assignments of the decree had taken place and the assignees have made several applications seeking a final decree as well as possession of part of the properties described in the suit schedule, on the basis of C compromise entered into with the assignors of the decree. The number of final decree applications disposed of by the High Court so far and the number of final decree applications now pending on the file of the High Court bear ample testimony to a gross abuse of the process of law, which has prompted the High Court to brand the preliminary decree as D vitiated by fraud and consequently null and void.
