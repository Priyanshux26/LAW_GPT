The Erection Purchase states that, where the PG test is deemed to have been carried out, the respondents remained liable for the guaranteed performance during the 180 days. However, it is silent on whether the deemed achievement of supplier’s liability in respect to Performance Guarantee test is retrospective to the date when the performance can be said to have been achieved. The tribunal finds that for the purposes of determining the delay caused by the failure to arrange a PG test it would be just to consider that the required performance was achieved on 21st September 2015 - the date on which the tribunal has found that the ACC unit was deemed to have been taken over. ………(para 13.13 (i) of the award) 17). Respondent no.1 did not issue the takeover certificate of equipment or a certificate of completion nor did it arrange a PG test. However, it has offered no evidence of any defects in the ACC unit that it has shown existed on 21st September 2015. Accordingly, the tribunal is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that respondent no.1 delayed issuing the said certificates and the PG test because it was not in a position, due to other factors beyond the Claimant’s control, to properly commission the ACC unit. Therefore, the tribunal is satisfied that at 21st September 2015, Respondent no.1 had delayed completion by 539 days and the claimant is entitled to 539 days’ extension of time. …………(para 13.13 (j) of the award) [2024] 9 S.C.R. 569 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. 18). Summary of Delays Delay in payment Nil Delay in handing over site Nil Due to change of specification of the Drain Pump 79 days Delay in BBU approval Nil Staircase and pipe rack Hindrance Nil Non-readiness of Respondent no.1 539 days The tribunal finds that these delays are not cumulative but parallel. The effect of the drain pump being changed would have occurred before mid-February 2014 when the tribunal found that the project was delayed by 158 days. Thus, the delay at that point for which the claimant was responsible was 158 days less 79 days allowed for the change of drain pump. Thus, the claimant was in culpable delay of 79 days in mid-February. The delay in commissioning occurred after mid-February 2014. Thus, the total extension of time granted by the tribunal is 539 days. ……. (para 13.14 of the award) 19). Liquidated Damages As the tribunal has granted an extension of time for completion of the ACC unit to 21st September 2015 and has also found that the requirements for completion of the ACC units were achieved on that date, the tribunal finds that the claimant has no liability for liquidated damages…. ……(para 13.15 of the award)” Relevant Article(s) of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963 applicable to the claim 88. Having taken note of the relevant facts as well as material observations in the arbitral award, we shall now consider as to which Article, or Articles(s), if more than one is applicable, of the Schedule to the 1963 Act would apply to the claim(s) of Enexio.
