If NOIDA does not approve an extension in advance, the day following the concession period’s final day becomes the transfer date, at which point NTBCL must transfer the Project. The language of Section 2.4 does not imply that an unrecovered Total Project Cost or returns would automatically extend the concession period. Rather, it grants NOIDA the sole discretion to determine extensions, thereby preventing an indefinite levy of user fees or tolls. 67. The High Court observed that, given the continual escalation of Total Project Cost, it would be infeasible to achieve full returns even over a 100-year period, resulting in NTBCL indefinitely collecting user fees. This assessment was corroborated by the Independent Auditor’s report for the year ending 31.03.2012, as well as a letter dated 29.08.2007 from Pradeep Puri to the CEO of NOIDA, which [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2035 Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd. v. Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association and Others noted that the concession period had effectively become perpetual. Consequently, it was clear that NTBCL would be unable to revert the Project assets to NOIDA free of cost, even after a century. 68. The prolonged success of this arrangement appears rooted in the deliberately crafted language of the Concession Agreement. The Concession Agreement contains provisions under Section 2.3 that establish a concession period of either 30 years from the effective date or until NTBCL recovers the Total Project Cost and returns, based on determinations made by the Independent Engineer and Auditor per Article 14 of the Concession Agreement. Should recovery not be achieved within 30 years, Section 2.4 provides for two-year extensions, repeating as necessary, until full recovery is realized. This clause raises the key question of whether such extensions are automatic or contingent upon NOIDA’s explicit consent, as NTBCL contends. 69. Given the critical roles of the Independent Auditor and Independent Engineer in determining the recovery of Total Project Cost and returns, it is essential to clarify whether their appointment lies with NTBCL, NOIDA, or both parties jointly. 70. According to Articles 8 and 10 of the Concession Agreement, the Independent Engineer and Independent Auditor are appointed by a Committee formed by the lenders, including IL&FS, NTBCL, and NOIDA. As NTBCL is a subsidiary of IL&FS, this arrangement positioned NOIDA as a minority member without meaningful authority in the appointments. Thus, IL&FS and NTBCL effectively controlled the selection, which casts serious doubts on the transparency and so-called independence of these appointments. This structure enables IL&FS and NTBCL to unilaterally influence as to whether the Total Project Cost and returns are deemed recovered, with NOIDA obliged to accept these determinations with hardly any other alternative. 71. The next point to address is whether NOIDA’s consent is required to extend the concession period or whether the concession period automatically extends based on the certification by the Independent Auditor and Independent Engineer regarding the recovery of the Total Project Cost after 30 years. 72. It is important to note that Article 18 of the Concession Agreement stipulates that if NOIDA decides to terminate the Concession Agreement before the Total Project Cost and returns are fully 2036 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
