The cost is estimated to run into thousands of crores. If the cables are undergrounded in their entirety, the cost of harnessing renewable energy would be prohibitive; i. Cables are not generally used for the evacuation of power from a generating station; j. The report prepared by the technical expert committee constituted by the Ministry of Power indicates that the undergrounding of transmission lines of 60kV and above is not technically feasible [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1351 M K Ranjitsinh & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. because any outage would result in large generation losses; k. It is essential to harness power from sources of renewable energy in Rajasthan and Gujarat to meet the rising power demand in the country in an expeditious and sustainable manner. This is also necessitated by India’s international commitments with respect to climate change; l. The area in which undergrounding has been directed to be implemented is about 80,688 sq km, which is larger than many states in India. Even globally, undergrounding of cables in such a large area has not been attempted; and m. The same area in which undergrounding has been directed to be implemented contains the lion’s share of the potential areas from which wind and solar energy may be harnessed. Until now, only 3% of this potential has been tapped. If the remaining potential remains untapped, an additional 93,000 MW of coal would be required in the future. An estimated 623 billion kg of carbon dioxide would be released from coal fired power generation. This would significantly damage the environment and hinder global efforts to combat climate change. Thermal power plants would also adversely impact the health of the local populace. 53. In addition to the reasons listed above, it is imperative to recognize the intricate interface between the conservation of an endangered species, such as the Great Indian Bustard, and the imperative of protecting against climate change. Unlike the conventional notion of sustainable development, which often pits economic growth against environmental conservation, the dilemma here involves a nuanced interplay between safeguarding biodiversity and mitigating the impact of climate change. It is not a binary choice between conservation and development but rather a dynamic interplay between protecting a critically endangered species and addressing the pressing global challenge of climate change. 54. India’s commitment to promoting renewable energy sources, particularly in regions like Gujarat and Rajasthan, aligns with its broader sustainable development objectives. By transitioning towards solar power and other renewable energy sources, India aims to not only reduce carbon emissions but also improve energy access, foster economic growth, and create employment opportunities. 1352 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 55. India’s commitment to sustainable development is also underpinned by its international obligations and commitments. As a signatory to various international conventions and agreements, including the UNFCCC and the Convention on Biological Diversity, India has pledged to uphold principles of environmental stewardship, biodiversity conservation, and climate action on the global stage. Through partnerships, knowledge sharing, and collaborative action, India seeks to amplify the impact of its sustainable development efforts, contributing to collective efforts aimed at addressing global challenges.
