[Paras 30 and 31] Land Acquisition Act, 1894 – Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 – Does the doctrine of merger operate as a bar to entertain the civil appeals in the instant case: Held: The concept of public interest need not be viewed narrowly only on the yardstick of loss to public exchequer and that these are the cases where public at large has acquired interest in the public infrastructures already complete or in process of completion, this Court is satisfied that if the doctrine of merger is applied mechanically in respect of Groups A (deals with M.A.s filed by the appellants-authorities primarily pleading change in law and [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1161 Government of NCT of Delhi & Anr. v. M/s BSK Realtors LLP & Anr. seeking recall of the s and s of this Court dismissing the Civil Appeals and/or Review Petitions in the first round) and B.1 (includes cases where Civil Appeals were dismissed in the first round, and now an SLP (now Civil Appeal) is pending before this Court in the second round) cases, it will lead to irreversible consequences – This Court is satisfied that the element of disparity between Groups A and B.1 cases visà-vis cases falling in Group C is liable to be eliminated and this can only be done by invoking extraordinary power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India so that complete justice is done between the expropriated landowners, the State and its developing agencies and most importantly the public in general who has acquired a vested right in the public infrastructure projects.
