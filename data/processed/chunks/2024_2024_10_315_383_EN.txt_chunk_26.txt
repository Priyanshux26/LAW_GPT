But it yields to the paramount rule that every statute is to be expounded according to its expressed or manifest intention and that all cases within the mischief aimed at our, if the language permits, to be held to fall within its remedial influence” 37 [1996] Supp. 8 SCR 243 : (1997) 1 SCC 682 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 355 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. Observations in the twelfth edition, in this context, are also educative: “The strict construction of penal statutes seems to manifest itself in four ways : In the requirement of express language for the creation of an offence; in interpreting strictly words setting out the elements of an offence; in requiring the fulfillment to the letter of statutory conditions precedent to the infliction of punishment; and in insisting on the strict observance of technical provisions concerning criminal procedure and jurisdiction.” 31.2 In Standard Chartered Bank v. Directorate of Enforcement,38 a Constitution Bench while discussing the interpretation of penal statutes, held as under: “36. The rule of interpretation requiring strict construction of penal statutes does not warrant a narrow and pedantic construction of a provision so as to leave loopholes for the offender to escape (see Murlidhar Meghraj Loya v. State of Maharashtra [(1976) 3 SCC 684 : 1976 SCC (Cri) 493] ). A penal statute has to also be so construed as to avoid a lacuna and to suppress mischief and to advance a remedy in the light of the rule in Heydon’s case [(1584) 3 Co Rep 7a : 76 ER 637] . A common-sense approach for solving a question of applicability of a penal statute is not ruled out by the rule of strict construction. (See State of A.P. v. Bathu Prakasa Rao [(1976) 3 SCC 301 : 1976 SCC (Cri) 395] and also G.P. Singh on Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 9th Edn., 2004, Chapter 11, Synopsis 3 at pp. 754 to 756. )” 31.3 In State of Jharkhand v. Ambay Cements,39 a Bench of three judges, while dealing with an issue relating to Bihar Industrial Promotion Policy, 1995, discussed the construction of penal statutes. The Court observed that: 38 [2005] Supp. 1 SCR 49 : (2005) 4 SCC 530 39 [2004] Supp. 6 SCR 125 : (2005) 1 SCC 368 356 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “26. Whenever the statute prescribes that a particular act is to be done in a particular manner and also lays down that failure to comply with the said requirement leads to severe consequences, such requirement would be mandatory. It is the cardinal rule of interpretation that where a statute provides that a particular thing should be done, it should be done in the manner prescribed and not in any other way. It is also settled rule of interpretation that where a statute is penal in character, it must be strictly construed and followed. Since the requirement, in the instant case, of obtaining prior permission is mandatory, therefore, non-compliance with the same must result in cancelling the concession made in favour of the grantee, the respondent herein.” 31.4 The course of action to be adopted by Courts, in view of language used in the statutes has been noticed by this Court in Manjit Singh v. CBI,40 wherein it has been observed, referring to certain other authorities, that when the language of a provision is unambiguous it would not be open to Courts to adopt a hypothetical approach, leading to a different conclusion on the ground that such different conclusion would be more in sync with the objective of the statute.
