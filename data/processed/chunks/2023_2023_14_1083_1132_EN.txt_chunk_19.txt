That is to say, where the Act and Rules prescribe a particular method and manner of survey, that method and manner only ought to have been followed and no other method or manner could have been followed. 58. The principle of law that “where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all and that other methods of performance are necessarily forbidden”40 would thus apply making the 2013 and 2018 surveys inapplicable to the processes under the 2013 Act. In fact, this very fi nding was arrived at by the High Court of Karnataka in All India Council of Trade Unions v. Union of India41 where the High Court held that if a survey had been conducted without following the rigors of the 2013 Act and Rules, it would not be a valid survey in so far as the Act and Rules are concerned. It was observed: “30. Now, we fi rstly come to the survey and identifi cation of manual scavengers in urban areas. The Manual Scavengers Act which is brought into the force in the year 2013 virtually accepts that even in 21st century, manual scavenging exists and that also in urban areas. 40 State of U.P. v. Singhara Singh, 1963 SCC OnLine SC 23: (1964) 4 SCR 485 at para 7. 41 (2020 SCC OnLine Kar 2420) DR. BALRAM SINGH v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 1111 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] Even assuming that the Local Authorities have carried out survey in terms of Section 11, it cannot be a lawful survey unless the Local Authorities have followed the procedure under Sub-Rules (10) to (12) of Rule 11 of the Manual Scavengers Rules by publishing a fi nal list. … 33. … The State Government will have to also inform the Court whether District wise lists are made and whether consolidated State list has been prepared. Moreover, the State will have to place on record whether the District Level Survey Committees have been formed in all the Districts and the State Level Survey Committee has been constituted. The State Government will have to point out the details of the number of meetings held of both the Committees.” 59. A similar direction had been passed by the High Court of Bombay in Vimla Govind Chorotiya and Others v. State of Maharashtra42 where it was held: “31. … (iv) Respondent No.1 i.e. State of Maharashtra in the Social Justice and Special Assistance Department shall inform the Court on the next date whether survey of manual scavenging in urban areas in terms of sections 11 and 12 of the 2013 Act and similar exercise by Panchayats in rural areas under sections 14 and 15 of the said 2013 Act have been carried out or not.” 60. This court notices that no provisional list under Section 11(4) was prepared; no objections were called for and decided under Section 11(5) and no fi nal list was published under Section 11(6).
