1133 Rajeev Kumar Upadhyay v. Srikant Upadhyay & Ors. Constitution. Recently, a bench of 3-judges in X2 v. State (NCT of Delhi)10 observed that the concept of dignity forms the very foundation of the Constitution and the rights enshrined in it. In Francis Coralie Mullin v. State (UT of Delhi),11 this Court recognized that the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity. In Pawan Kumar v. State of H.P.,12 : “47. …A woman has her own space as a man has. She enjoys as much equality under Article 14 of the Constitution as a man does. The right to live with dignity as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution cannot be violated by indulging in obnoxious act of eve teasing. It affects the fundamental concept of gender sensitivity and justice and the rights of a woman under Article 14 of the Constitution. That apart it creates an incurable dent in the right of a woman which she has under Article 15 of the Constitution. One is compelled to think and constrained to deliberate why the women in this country cannot be allowed to live in peace and lead a life that is empowered with dignity and freedom. It has to be kept in mind that she has a right to life and entitled to love according to her choice. She has an individual choice which has been legally recognised. It has to be socially respected. No one can compel a woman to love. She has the absolute right to reject. … 48. In a civilised society male chauvinism has no room. The Constitution of India confers the affirmative rights on women and the said rights are perceptible from Article 15 of the Constitution. When the right is conferred under the Constitution, it has to be understood that there is no condescension. A man should not put his ego or, for that matter, masculinity on a pedestal and abandon the concept of civility. Egoism must succumb to law. Equality has to be regarded as the summum bonum of the constitutional principle in this context. …” 10 [2022] 7 SCR 686 : (2023) 9 SCC 433 11 [1981] 2 SCR 516 : (1981) 1 SCC 608 12 [2017] 3 SCR 458 : (2017) 7 SCC 780 1134 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 17. What can be gathered from reference to the above s is that dignity is an invaluable aspect of Indian Constitutional jurisprudence, and there exists a duty upon the State to take all action to protect the same. 18. There is undoubtedly a right to live with dignity, as discussed above. But concomitantly, there is a duty cast upon every citizen to promote harmony and a spirit of common brotherhood amongst all, keeping aside the differences that are only natural in a country which is as vast and varied as India. Reference can be made to Article 51A of the Constitution. It is to be emphasized that 51A(e) extracted herein below postulates a duty to renounce practices which are derogatory to women.
