This, of course, can be shown by practice as well as by a written instrument. Thus, the question for consideration is whether on the evidence obtaining in the instant case, can it be said that Respondent 3 had an express or implied authority to act on behalf of Respondent 1 as their agent? If Respondent 3 had such an authority, then obviously Respondent 1 was bound by the commitment Respondent 3 had made to the appellant.” 23. In the case at hand, in the absence of a plea by the respondent No.1, that the respondent no. 2 was not its agent or that he had no authority to give schedule of delivery of consignment, the onus has not been discharged. Therefore, the respondent No.1 is bound by the promise held by its agent - respondent No.2, that the goods shall be delivered within one week and when the time schedule expired and the goods were, in fact, delivered after one and a half month, there was negligent delay in delivery of consignment. 24. The grievance of the appellant in this appeal is mainly on account of the NCDRC not allowing the entire claim for compensation by calculating the total weight of the subject consignment at 2507.5 Kg. multiplied by US $ 20 per Kg. According to the appellant, in view of Rule 22 (2) of Schedule-III of the Carriage by Air Act, 1972 (as amended by the Hague Protocol) the amount thus calculated would exceed the sum of Rs. 20 292 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. lakhs. The appellant would thus claim the entire amount equivalent to US $ 50070 without limiting it to Rs. 20 lakhs. However, on this point also, we approve and sustain the passed by the NCDRC for the reason that in its complaint under Section 21(a)(i) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the complainant/appellant has sought damages for Rs. 20 lakhs only as compensation for loss of business and reputation. It is a trite law that a party is not entitled to seek relief which he has not prayed for. For this proposition we may profi tably refer to this Court’s s in Merrrs. Trojan & Co. Vs. RM.N.N. Nagappa Chettiar3, Krishna Priya Ganguly etc. etc. Vs. University of Lucknow & Ors4., Om Prakash & Ors. Vs. Ram Kumar & Ors5., Bharat Amratlal Kothari Vs. Dosukhan Samadkhan Sindhi & Ors6., Manohar Lal (Dead) by Lrs. Vs. Ugrasen (Dead) by Lrs. & Ors.7 25. In view of the forgoing reasons, we are not inclined to interfere with the passed by the NCDRC and resultantly both the Civil Appeals deserve to be and are hereby dismissed. The parties shall bear their own costs. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of Headnotes prepared by: Appeals dismissed.
