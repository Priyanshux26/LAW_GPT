[Para 40] Constitution of India – Art.300-A – Role of the State under Article 300-A of the Constitution – Responsibility of State to ensure full payment of compensation determined: Held: It is settled that once the compensation has been determined, the same is payable immediately without any requirement of a 446 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports representation or request by the landowners and a duty is cast on the State to pay such compensation to the land losers, otherwise there would be a breach of Article 300-A of the Constitution – In the instant case, the Government of Himachal Pradesh as a welfare State ought to have proactively intervened in the matter with a view to ensure that the requisite amount towards compensation is paid at the earliest – The State cannot abdicate its constitutional and statutory responsibility of payment of compensation by arguing that its role was limited to initiating acquisition proceedings under the MOU signed between the Appellant, JAL and itself – This Court finds that the delay in the payment of compensation to the landowners after taking away ownership of the subject land from them is in contravention to the spirit of the constitutional scheme of Article 300A and the idea of a welfare State – The State Government, in peculiar circumstances, was expected to make the requisite payment towards compensation to the landowners from its own treasury and should have thereafter proceeded to recover the same from JAL – Instead of making the poor landowners to run after the powerful corporate houses, it should have compelled JAL to make the necessary payment – Also, the State of Himachal Pradesh, being a welfare state, did not ensure payment of compensation to the Respondent Nos. 1-6 before taking possession of their land – A bare reading of Section 38 of the 2013 Act indicates that the payment of full and final compensation to the land owners is a precursor to taking possession of the land sought to be acquired from such persons – In fact, the landowners had to approach the High Court to seek directions to the LAC for passing of the supplementary award which was finally passed on 02.05.2022 that is, after a period of almost four years from the date of passing of the Award of 2018 – Further, Section 41 of 1894 Act necessitates an agreement between the appropriate government and the company for whose purpose the land is being acquired – One of the purposes of such an agreement is to ensure that payment towards the cost of acquisition is made by the company to the appropriate government and it is only upon such payment that the land is transferred to the company – Thus, it can be said that JAL was mandated to make the requisite payment to the State of Himachal Pradesh prior to the subject land being transferred to it – However, even before the amount of compensation could be determined by way of a supplementary award as stipulated in the Award dated 08.06.2018, the subject land stood transferred to [2024] 9 S.C.R.
