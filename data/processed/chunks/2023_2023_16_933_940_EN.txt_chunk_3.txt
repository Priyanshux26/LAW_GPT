The details of the amount to be paid to the State Government was also asked for. The respondent was entitled to get that details before accepting the off er in to avoid any dispute in future. There was no refusal to accept the off er. The amount asked for by the appellant included the amount already paid to the State Government, the details thereof was sought. The information was asked for by the respondent as in the letter of off er dated 13.12.1982, the appellant had asked for payment of certain amounts which as compared to the rate at which the plot was initially allotted was exorbitant. He further submitted that there is no error in the passed by the High Court as the lower Appellate Court had reversed the well-reasoned and decree of the Trial Court on erroneous appreciation of evidence produced on record. The respondent has been waiting for the plot after depositing the amount way back in 1960s for the last six decades. The fault lies with the appellant. Interim stay was granted by the High Court, hence, to state that the plot is not available now will be contemptuous. 10 (1996) 4 SCC 593. 11 Regular Second Appeal No. 293 of 2003 938 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 8. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the paper book. 9. The facts of the case to the extent that the respondent had applied for allotment of plot measuring 233 square yards at the rate of ₹25/- per square yard, which was allotted to him on 19.11.1963, are not in dispute. Total sale consideration was ₹5825/-. As noticed by the High Court in the impugned , the respondent had paid total sum of ₹4,945/-. The colony was not developed, as the stand taken by the appellant is that two new enactments by the State, namely, 1963 Act and 1971 Act intervened, in terms of which number of permissions were required to be taken. The appellant, after taking those permissions, off ered to the respondent an alternative plot vide letter dated 13.12.1982 @ ₹135/- per square yard which, as per the letter, included the cost of the land and internal development charges. The amount already paid or payable to the Haryana Government on account of external development will be additionally payable by the allottee. The off er was to be accepted within ten days. Twenty fi ve percent of the total amount was payable immediately. Twenty percent of the total amount was to be deposited within 30 days. The balance 55% was to be deposited in phased manner corresponding with the development of the colony. From paragraph 6 of the aforesaid letter, it is evident that beyond 100% of the cost of the plot, which was sought to be off ered @ ₹135/-per square yard, ₹20/- per square yard was asked for as part payment to be deposited with the State Government for development work. The fact remains that the size of the plot was not mentioned in the letter.
