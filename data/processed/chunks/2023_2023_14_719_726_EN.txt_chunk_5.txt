19. We are inclined to accept the request, making it clear that in case the fi nancial creditors are not inclined to do so, if any further proceedings are initiated by the respondent(s) in that behalf, that would not impede the process to be dragged on by the respondent No.1. It is a one time window given to the respondent No.1. This is also as according to the learned counsel for respondent No.1. if the fi nancial creditors accept the proposal and the fl at buyers are involved, the process started would itself dissolve. 20. In view of the aforesaid terms while enunciating the legal proposition, we, thus, allow the appeal and set aside paragraph Nos.32 and 34 of the impugned . 726 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. 21. Needless to say that beyond the window of two months, if the OTS is not accepted, the appellant will be free to declare the results of the e-voting qua all the proposals. 22. The appeal stands allowed leaving parties to bear their own costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Divya Pandey
