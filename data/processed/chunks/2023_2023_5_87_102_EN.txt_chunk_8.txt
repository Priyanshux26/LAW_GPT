Thus, the High Court was justified in setting aside the 2nd and 3rd Merit List; 5.3 Even the Acting Chief Justice vide dated 01.03.2018, opined that an unfortunate situation had arisen due to partial re-evaluation of only 13 candidates as the marks of all 13 candidates had increased E and ideally all papers should have been re-evaluated on identical standards. Further, the Special Committee decided on 07.03.2018 that the ranks awarded vide 1stMerit List will not be disturbed and the newly selected candidates will be placed at the bottom of the select list as re- evaluation cannot confer any benefit of seniority, which was, as per the F committee, only way to ensure complete and equitable justice to all the candidates. Therefore, Notification dated 14.03.2018 directing appointment of appellants stated that they will be placed at the bottom of the select list after the last successful candidate in the 1stMerit List. The said being the background of appointment of the appellants, the same ought not to have been disturbed subsequently. Revised Merit List dated G 23.10.2018 was in violation of the recommendations made by the Special Committee on 07.03.2018 which was duly approved by the then Acting Chief Justice on 14.03.2018; 5.4 Appellants have not challenged the Notification dated 14.03.2018 till date which granted them conditional appointment i.e., they H 98 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A agreed to be placed at the bottom of the original select list upon appointment without disturbing the seniority of originally selected candidates. Thus, having accepted conditional appointment, the appellants cannot be allowed to steal a march over originally selected candidates; 5.5 The special concession granted to the appellants is further B established by the fact that they were given appointment against future vacancies, and not the ones advertised in 2016. Equity in favor of the appellants cannot be stretched to defeat the equities in favor of the respondents. Special concession cannot override vested rights. 5.6 It is further submitted that as per the settled principle of law a C candidate can be granted seniority only from the date he is borne in the cadre and not retrospectively. Reliance is placed on the following decisions of this Court in the case of K. Meghchandra Singh (supra) (para 37-39), Nani Shah and Ors. Vs. State of Arunachal Pradesh and Ors., (2007) 15 SCC 406 (para 16) and State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. Vs. Ashok Kumar Srivastava, (2014) 14 SCC 720 (para D 24). 5.7 Making the above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeals by submitting that by the impugned and the High Court has tried to do the justice between the parties by protecting the appointments of appellants as well as seniority of the respondents. E 6. Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties at length. 6.1 The issue before this Court for consideration is: whether the appellants herein whose marks were increased pursuant to the exercise of re-evaluation are entitled to be ranked in accordance with the revised F marks in the merit list which determines their seniority for future promotions?
