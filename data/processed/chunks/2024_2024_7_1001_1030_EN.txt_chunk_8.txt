The Collector claims to have decided the objections through a corrigendum, which was signed by such individuals who were either strangers to the acquisition or were not the objectors. NOIDA has not disputed the manipulation of records in relation thereto. f) S/Shri Jasbir Singh Malik and Samarhar Singh, learned counsels, further argued that the respondents had already utilised a part of their lands for residential purposes – the same being within ‘abadi’ area. They relied upon an dated 5 [2009] 14 SCR 1111 : (2009) 10 SCC 115 6 [1977] 1 SCR 71 : (1976) 3 SCC 719 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1013 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. Darshan Lal Bohra & Ors. 19.07.1992 passed by the Assistant Collector, Secunderabad in purported exercise of powers under Section 143 of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, whereby the subject land was classified as non-agricultural land. They also referred to the objections which Respondent No.1 had filed against a previous notification issued under Section 4 of the 1894 Act on 07.11.2007. In those objections, it was pointed out that the subject land was a part of the ‘abadi’ area of the village and hence deserved to be exempted from acquisition. Those objections statedly found favour with the State Government and the land was accordingly excluded from the 2007 acquisition. It was, thus, contended that NOIDA or the State Government cannot initiate a fresh acquisition process as the subject land continues to be a part and parcel of ‘abadi’ land. g) Furthermore, most of the land adjoining their lands has been exempted from acquisition as it already stands declared as ‘abadi’ area. Since only the respondents are sought to be singled out, the impugned action does not satisfy the equality test of Article 14 of the Constitution. h) Lastly and alternatively, learned counsels for the respondents urged that in the event of acquisition process being upheld by this Court due to exigency or for regulated development of the area, in that case, the land-owners be held entitled to receive compensation at the current market value and in accordance with the provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter ‘2013 Act). In support thereto, they have placed reliance on the decisions in (i) Nareshbhai Bhaggubhai v. Union of India;7 (ii) NOIDA v. Lt. Col. J.B. Kuchhal; 8 and (iii) Competent Authority v. Barangore Jute Factory,9 wherein, this Court after taking notice of the facts and circumstances, granted compensation on the current market value of the land. 7 [2019] 10 SCR 88 : (2019) 15 SCC 1 8 (2020) 18 SCC 619 9 [2005] Supp. 5 SCR 421 : (2005) 13 SCC 477 1014 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports D. Analysis 13. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions at length, we find that primarily the following two issues arise for consideration of this Court: a) Whether the respondents have forestalled their right to challenge the acquisition proceeding on the ground of non-compliance of Section 5A because: i) they have not filed objections; or ii) they were not tenure holders as per the revenue records on the date of notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act; or iii) after submitting their objections, they have accepted compensation without any demur?
