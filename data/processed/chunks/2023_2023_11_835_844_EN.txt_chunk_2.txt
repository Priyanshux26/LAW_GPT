The High Court having accepted the suggestion permitted the appellant to pay the said amount and avail the benefi t. The appellants having deposited, availed the benefi t and proceeded with the construction. 4. During the pendency of the writ petition, the respondent issued a notifi cation dated 17.07.2012 whereby an amendment was made in para 6(g) to the notifi cation dated 10.10.2008 and 23.12.2008 which were assailed before the High Court. By such amendment, it was provided that no additional FAR charges would be recovered from Educational Societies/ Health Care and Social Welfare Societies having Income Tax Exemption. The said benefi t became available to the appellants herein and as such the writ petitions pending before the High Court did not warrant an adjudication on the disputed questions. Therefore, the High Court in all the writ petitions which were pending before it had taken note of the change made through the subsequent notifi cation and had accordingly disposed of the analogous matters in W.P. (C) No.8572 of 2009 and other petitions through the dated 20.07.2012. In the said proceedings the deposit which had been made either before the High Court or by way of bank guarantees were permitted to be withdrawn. LAL BAHADUR SHASTRI EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY 839 v. DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY [A.S. BOPANNA, J.] 5. In that background the writ petitions fi led by the appellants herein before the High Court were also disposed of. We take note of the dated 31.10.2013 in the case of the appellant in fi rst of the appeals herein, whereby the High Court having extracted the earlier had disposed of the writ petition. Insofar as the amount deposited with the respondent, it was directed that the refund be made within the period of eight weeks but the prayer for payment of interest was declined. It is in that light the appellant is before this Court. 6. At this juncture it is relevant to note that in the case relating to appellant in the second of the appeals herein, the writ petition in W.P. (C) No.2823 of 2010 had been disposed of in similar terms through the dated 27.08.2012 and the deposited amount was directed to be released. In that view, an application was taken out by the said appellant herein on the aspect relating to interest and had sought refund of the amount with the interest at 15% per annum. The High Court having considered the matter was of the opinion that since the writ petitions were not ultimately adjudicated, the claim for interest would not be justifi ed. The appellant in the second of the above noted cases had therefore assailed the said passed by the High Court in W.P. (C) 2823 of 2010, before this Court in SLP (C) Nos.7907-7908 of 2013. The said SLP came to be dismissed on 22.02.2013. In that view, insofar as the claim for pendente lite interest being declined insofar as the appellant in the second of the above-noted matters, it has attained fi nality. 7.
