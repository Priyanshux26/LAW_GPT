Similarly, it is wholly inappropriate for the High Court to observe that the questionnaire may also be handed over to the respondent. Such s of the High Court are liable to gravely prejudice the course of investigation. Particularly at this stage when the CBI is to fully investigate the crime and the role of several accused who do not form a part of the charge sheet as submitted, we are of the view E that the directions issued by the High Court were unwarranted. 31. We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the impugned of the High Court dated 18 April 2023. 32. Since the application for anticipatory bail before the High Court is pending consideration, we clarify that the observations in this F shall not come in the way of the High Court evaluating the application. 33. Having regard to the developments which have intervened, we are of the considered view that the time for the completion of investigation by the CBI should be extended and we accordingly extend it until 30 June 2023.
