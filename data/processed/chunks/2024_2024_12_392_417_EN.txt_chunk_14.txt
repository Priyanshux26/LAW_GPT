Injuries received by the accused; 4. The injuries caused by the accused; 5. The accused did not have time or opportunity to take recourse to public authorities. 26.2 This Court in Darshan Singh v. State of Punjab,9 held that the law provides for the right of private defense to citizens to enable them to protect themselves when confronted with imminent danger or unlawful aggression. But such protection must not be misused or extend beyond the necessities of the case. 26.3 The counsel for the appellant has argued that the appellant acted under a genuine belief of impending harm. However, this argument falls short upon scrutiny of the injuries sustained by the appellant during the altercation. As per the wound certificate, the appellant suffered only minor injuries: i. A contusion on the back of the buttock. ii. An abrasion over the forehead. 26.4 The medical evidence confirms that these injuries were superficial and did not pose any real or imminent threat to the appellant’s life or safety. The courts below have rightly concluded that the appellant’s perception of danger was neither reasonable nor proportional to the force he employed in response. It is a settled position of law that the number of injuries on the accused side by itself may not be sufficient to establish right of private defense, 9 [2010] 1 SCR 642 : (2010) 2 SCC 333 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 413 Kunhimuhammed@Kunheethu v. The State of Kerala as has been held by this Court in V. Subramani vs. State of Tamil Nadu.10 But it has further been held that an overall view of the case has to be taken to check whether a case for private defense is made out from the evidence on record. 26.5 Even if the appellant claims to have acted in defense, his role in bringing about the altercation cannot be overlooked. The appellant cannot benefit from the exception when he was instrumental in creating the circumstances that led to the confrontation. It has been held in the case of Sone Lal vs. State of U.P.,11 that when the aggressors, even if they receive injuries from the victims of their aggression, cannot have the right of private defence. The courts below have made a categorical finding that the appellant– accused no.1 and his co-accused were the aggressors in the altercation. The attack was initiated by the accused group, who were armed with sticks and a knife, with the intent to intimidate or harm the victim and his companions. This fact is substantiated by the testimony of PW-1, an injured eyewitness, who described the sequence of events leading up to the stabbing. Even if it were assumed that the appellant–accused no. 1 acted in self- defense, the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the force used was excessive and disproportionate. The act of stabbing the deceased multiple times in vital organs such as the chest and heart goes far beyond what is permissible under the right of private defense. 26.6 As noted in the post-mortem report and corroborated by the testimony of PW-6 (the police surgeon), the injuries inflicted on the deceased were severe and intentional, including a fatal wound to the heart.
