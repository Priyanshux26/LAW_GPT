3,43,178/- in 2019, it was not open for the ADA to raise the plea of limitation. In so far as the pecuniary jurisdiction is concerned, the NCDRC held that the claim was of more than Rs. 2 crores as such the said [2024] 9 S.C.R. 103 Dharmendra Sharma v. Agra Development Authority objection was also not sustainable. The NCDRC, however, held that the additional demand made by the ADA vide communication dated 04.02.2014 although was other than additional cost of 10% which was permissible but, in any case, it was within the 10% admissible clause, as such could not be held to be illegal. The NCDRC also held that if the possession was delayed beyond two years, the appellant would be entitled for a refund but in the present case, Clause 27 of the Registration and Allotment Rules would not be applicable. The NCDRC further held that although the appellant had deposited the non-judicial stamps worth Rs. 3,99,100/- on 15.02.2014 but he continued to delay payment of additional demand of Rs. 3,43,178/- and was continuously requesting for waiver of interest resulting into the presumption that he was avoiding payment of the balance amount. On such finding the NCDRC denied to grant interest from the date of deposit but made it applicable from the date of the filing of the complaint. In so far as the deficiency in construction was concerned, the NCDRC found that only bald allegations have been made by the appellant and he never made any effort to get a report from the Commissioner and allowed the apartment in question to remain locked for six years. 9. After considering the pleadings and evidence on record and in view of the above findings, the complaint was partly allowed by the NCDRC on 15.09.2023. 10. The appellant preferred a Review Application which was dismissed by the NCDRC by its dated 30th October, 2023. In the Review Application also, the NCDRC reiterated that the review was liable to be rejected as while offering possession, the ADA vide letter dated 04.12.2014 had made a further demand which amount was not deposited within the time and it was only deposited in 2019 and that too without interest and the complaint was made after six years and, therefore, the appellant would not be entitled to interest from the date of deposit. 11. In the two appeals filed by the appellant, the relief claimed is to the extent that the payment of interest be awarded from the date of deposit while refunding the same and not from the date of the complaint. Whereas in the appeal filed by the ADA, it is submitted that in view of the fact that the petition had been filed after six years from the date of offering possession, as such it was barred by limitation and also as the amount deposited was only Rs. 59,91,000/- i.e. less 104 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports than Rs. 1 crore, the complaint ought to have been filed before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and the NCDRC would have no pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the complaint with a value of less than Rs.
