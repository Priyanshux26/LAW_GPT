[Para 20] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Exercise of power under s.482 – Prevention of abuse of the process of the Court: Held: It is to be exercised ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice for the administration of which alone courts exist – The authority of the court exists for advancement of justice and if any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to produce injustice, the court has the power to prevent such abuse – It would be an abuse of process of the court to allow any action which would result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice – In exercise of the powers, the court would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that the initiation or continuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or quashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice – When no offence is disclosed by the complaint, the court may examine the question of fact – When a complaint is sought to be quashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the complainant has alleged and whether any offence is made out even if the allegations are accepted in toto. [Para 21] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.482 – No restriction on exercise of power – Stages of FIR, investigation and chargesheet: [2024] 6 S.C.R. 131 Achin Gupta v. State of Haryana & Anr. Held: Once the investigation is over and chargesheet is filed, the FIR pales into insignificance – The court, thereafter, owes a duty to look into all the materials collected by the investigating agency in the form of chargesheet – There is nothing in the words of Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. which restricts the exercise of the power of the court to prevent the abuse of process of court or miscarriage of justice only to the stage of the FIR – It would be a travesty of justice to hold that the proceedings initiated against a person can be interfered with at the stage of FIR but not if it has materialized into a chargesheet. [Para 22] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.482 – General and sweeping allegations – Matrimonial dispute – Duty of Court: Held: If a person is made to face a criminal trial on some general and sweeping allegations without bringing on record any specific instances of criminal conduct, it is nothing but abuse of the process of the court – The court owes a duty to subject the allegations levelled in the complaint to a thorough scrutiny to find out, prima facie, whether there is any grain of truth in the allegations or whether they are made only with the sole object of involving certain individuals in a criminal charge, more particularly when a prosecution arises from a matrimonial dispute. [Para 25] Penal Code, 1860 – s.498A – Matrimonial dispute – Determining cruelty – Consequence of technical and hyper sensitive approach: Held: The Court must appreciate that all quarrels must be weighed from that point of view in determining what constitutes cruelty in each particular case, always keeping in view the physical and mental conditions of the parties, their character and social status – A very technical and hyper sensitive approach would prove to be disastrous for the very institution of the marriage – Police machinery should be resorted to as a measure of last resort and that too in a very genuine case of cruelty and harassment – The Police machinery cannot be utilised for the purpose of holding the husband at ransom so that he could be squeezed by the wife at the instigation of her parents or relatives or friends.
