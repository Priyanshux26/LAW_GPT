2. The argument raised by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant is that the original owner of the land challenged the acquisition by filing W.P. (C) No.1229 of 1986 which was dismissed for non-prosecution on 09.12.2004. The respondent No.1 claimed that he H 314 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A had purchased the land in question from the original owner in terms of the no objection certificate granted to him under Section 8 of the Delhi Lands (Restrictions on Transfer) Act, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as “the 1972 Act”), vide sale deed dated 18.06.2023. The respondent No.1 also filed writ petition challenging the acquisition, after the purchase of the land, bearing W.P. (C) No.3701 of 2008, which was dismissed on B 22.10.2008 leaving it open to the respondent no.1 to file review/recall of the dated 09.12.2004, vide which the writ petition filed by the original owner, challenging the acquisition of land, was dismissed. It was submitted that the aforesaid application was also dismissed. Referring to the of this Court in Shiv Kumar and Ors. v. Union of C India and Ors.1, it was submitted that a subsequent buyer of the land after the process of acquisition is complete does not have any locus to invoke Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act, to claim that the acquisition in question has lapsed. Hence, the writ petition itself being not maintainable deserves to be dismissed. The passed by the High Court be set aside. D 3. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no.1 submitted that it is a case where neither the compensation has been paid nor the possession of the land has been taken. The respondent no.1 has already constructed his house on the land in question and living there for more than a decade. He is assessed to house tax, E which is being paid regularly. At this stage, disturbing his possession will be quite harsh as he would be deprived of shelter on his head. He further submitted that the sale deed in the case was registered after due permission from the authorities under the provisions of the 1972 Act. Hence, at this stage, he should not be deprived of his possession. The F appeal be dismissed. 4. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the paper book. 5. The basic facts which are not in dispute are that the process of acquisition of land in question started with the issuance of notification of G Section 4 of the 1894 Act on 25.11.1980. Subsequently, notification under Section 6 was issued on 27.05.1985. The owner of the land at that stage challenged the acquisition by filing W.P. (C) No.1229 of 1986. Award under Section 11 of the 1894 Act was announced by the Land Acquisition H 1 2019 (10) SCC 229 GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI v. RAVINDER KUMAR 315 JAIN & ORS.
