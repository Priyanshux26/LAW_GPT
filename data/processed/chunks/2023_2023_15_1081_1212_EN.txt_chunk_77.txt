In that case, it was observed that although “stamp duty has been paid, whether it be insuffi cient or appropriate is a question that may be answered at a later stage as this Court cannot review or go into this aspect under Section 11(6).” 213. The discussion in preceding segments has held that non-stamping or insuffi cient stamping of an instrument does not render it invalid or non- existent. Therefore, paragraphs 22 and 29 of Garware Wall Ropes (supra), which held that an arbitration agreement contained in an unstamped or insuffi ciently stamped contract would be non-existent in law, does not set forth the correct position of law. K*. The Appointment of Arbitrators by the Chief Justice of India Scheme, 1996 214. In N N Global 2 (supra), the majority considered the Appointment of Arbitrators by the Chief Justice of India Scheme, 1996.172 Para 2 of the 1996 Scheme reads as follows: * Ed. Note: PART K 171 (2022) 7 SCC 662 172 “1996 Scheme” IN RE: INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UNDER 1189 THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT 1996 AND THE INDIAN STAMP ACT 1899 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI ] “2. Submission of request.- The request to the Chief Justice under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) of section 11 shall be made in writing and shall be accompanied by- (a) the original arbitration agreement or a duly certifi ed copy thereof; The 1996 Scheme provides that an application under Section 11 for the appointment of an arbitrator shall be accompanied by the original arbitration agreement or a duly certifi ed copy. 215. In SMS Tea Estates (supra), it was observed that a certifi ed copy of the agreement/ contract/ instrument containing the arbitration clause should disclose the stamp duty that has been paid on the original. N N Global 2 (supra) has endorsed this view. In that case, this Court further referred to paragraph 5 of the 1996 Scheme which allows the Chief Justice or the person or the institution designated by him under para 3 to seek further information or clarifi cation from the party making request under the Scheme. Consequently, it was held that a Judge dealing with an application under Section 11 could seek further clarifi cation or information with respect to the payment of stamp duty to satisfy the requirements as laid down in SMS Tea Estates (supra). 216. N N Global 2 (supra) also refers to the two-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Jupudi Kesava Rao v. Pulavarthi Venkata Subbarao173 where it was held that Section 35 of the Stamp Act renders any secondary evidence of an unstamped or insuffi ciently stamped instrument inadmissible in evidence. It was further held that any secondary evidence of such instrument cannot be acted upon in terms of Section 35. Subsequently, a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Hariom Agrawal v. Prakash Chand Malviya174 affirmed Jupudi Kesava Rao (supra) by observing that Sections 33 and 35 of the Stamp Act are not concerned with any copy of the instrument.
