the Company in liquidation. The liability is absolute and unconditional. The fact that the Company in liquidation i.e. the principal debtor has gone into liquidation also would not have any effect on the liability of the Bank i.e. the guarantor. Under Section 128 of the Contract Act, 1872, the liability of the surety is coextensive with that of the principal debtor unless it is otherwise provided by the contract. A surety is no doubt discharged under Section 134 of the Contract Act, 1872 by any contract between the creditor and the principal debtor by which the principal debtor is released or by any act or omission of the creditor, the legal consequence of which is the discharge of the principal debtor. But a discharge which the principal debtor may secure by operation of law in bankruptcy (or in liquidation proceedings in the case of a company) does not absolve the surety of his liability (see Jagannath Ganeshram Agarwale v. Shivnarayan Bhagirath [Jagannath Ganeshram Agarwale v. Shivnarayan Bhagirath, 1939 SCC OnLine Bom 65 : AIR 1940 Bom 247]; see also Fitzgeorge, In re [Fitzgeorge, In re,(1905)1KB462] ).” 123. This legal position was noticed and approved later in Industrial Finance Corpn. of India Ltd. v. Cannanore Spg. & Wvg. Mills Ltd. [Industrial Finance Corpn. of India Ltd. v. Cannanore Spg. & Wvg. Mills Ltd., (2002) 5 SCC 54] An earlier decision of three Judges in Punjab National Bank v. State of U.P. [Punjab National Bank v. State of U.P., (2002) 5 SCC 80] pertains to the issues regarding a guarantor and the principal debtor. The Court observed as follows : (Punjab National Bank case [Punjab National Bank v. State of U.P., (2002) 5 SCC 80] , SCC p. 80-81, paras 1-6) 2160 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “1. The appellant had, after Respondent 4’s management was taken over by U.P. State Textile Corporation Ltd. (Respondent 3) under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, advanced some money to the said Respondent 4. In respect of the advance so made, Respondents 1, 2 and 3 executed deeds of guarantee undertaking to pay the amount due to the Bank as guarantors in the event of the principal borrower being unable to pay the same. 2. Subsequently, Respondent 3 which had taken over the management of Respondent 4 became sick and proceedings were initiated under the Sick Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Act, 1974 (for short “the Act”). The appellant filed suit for recovery against the guarantors and the principal debtor of the amount claimed by it. 3. The following preliminary issue was, on the pleadings of the parties, framed: ‘Whether the claim of the plaintiff is not maintainable in view of the provisions of Act 57 of 1974 as alleged in Para 25 of the written statement of Defendant 2?’ 4. The trial court as well as the High Court, both came to the conclusion that in view of the provisions of Section 29 of the Act, the suit of the appellant was not maintainable.
