40. Insofar as (i) (supra) is concerned, the review petitioner has to show that such evidence (a) was actually available on the date the court made the /decree, (b) with reasonable care and diligence, it could not be brought by him before the court at the time of the / decree, (c) it was relevant and material for a decision, and (d) by reason of its absence, a miscarriage of justice has been caused in the sense that had it been produced and considered by the court, the ultimate decision would have been otherwise. 19 [2018] 14 SCR 239 : (2019) 18 SCC 586 978 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 41. Regarding (ii) (supra), the review petitioner has to satisfy the court that the mistake or error committed by it is self-evident and such mistake or error can be pointed out without any long-drawn process of reasoning; and, if such mistake or error is not corrected and is permitted to stand, the same will lead to a failure of justice. There cannot be a fit-in-all definition of “mistake or error apparent on the face of the record” and it has been considered prudent by the courts to determine whether any mistake or error does exist considering the facts of each individual case coming before it. 42. With regard to (iii) (supra), we can do no better than refer to the traditional view in Chhajju Ram (supra), a decision of a Bench of seven Law Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. It was held there that the words “any other sufficient reason” means “a reason sufficient on grounds at least analogous to those specified immediately previously”, meaning thereby (i) and (ii) (supra). Notably, Chhajju Ram (supra) has been consistently followed by this Court in a number of decisions starting with Moran Mar Basselios Catholics v. Most Rev. Mar Poulose Athanasius.20 43. There are recent decisions of this Court which have viewed ‘mistake’ as an independent ground to seek a review. Whether or not such decisions express the correct view need not detain us since the review here is basically prayed in view of the subsequent event. 44. As noted above, the Explanation in Rule 1 XLVII was inserted in 1976. It reads: “Explanation.— The fact that the decision on a question of law on which the of the Court is based has been reversed or modified by the subsequent decision of a superior court in any other case, shall not be a ground for the review of such .” 45. The above insertion was preceded by a recommendation contained in the 54th report of the Law Commission. The decisions in Syed Liaqat Husain v. Mohd. Razi,21 Lachhmi Narain Balu v.
