Similarly, another proposal under the FCA, 1980 for usage of 258 hectares of forest land for mining purpose for ‘Bina Coal Project’ was submitted to the Central Government for obtaining its approval. 5. Accordingly, in pursuance of Section 2 of the FCA, 1980, the Central Government, vide its dated 23.05.1996, granted approval for diversion of 258 hectares of forest land under ‘Bina Project’, which was communicated by the State Government to the Respondent vide letter dated 28.06.1998.

Digital Supreme Court Reports 6. The Respondent, by virtue of Section 18A of the CBA, 1957, has been paying money equal to royalty as determined under Section 9 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 19574. However, the letter dated 23.03.2010 and subsequent letter dated 11.06.2010 were issued to the Respondent demanding the deposit of “lease rent” amounting to Rs.1,24,23,015/- in accordance with Condition No. 7 of ‘Krishnashila Project’ and Rs.1,91,25,593/- in accordance with Condition No. 12 of ‘Bina Project’. 7. Aggrieved by the said demand for “lease rent”, the Respondent preferred the Writ Petition before the High Court, which was allowed while observing that the entire area has been acquired under CBA, 1957 under which the State has no legislative competence as held in State of West Bengal v. Union of India.5 Therefore, where the State is denuded of any power to legislate in the matter or to exercise any executive power under Article 162 of the Constitution and no satisfactory basis has been disclosed by the State Government for claiming the lease rent from the Respondent, Condition No. 7 in Government dated 27.07.2007 which is unsupported by any legal basis, cannot be permitted to operate against the Respondent. The State of UP, being aggrieved by the said , is in appeal before us.
