9.1.4 This Court noted that on 08.05.1952, the Parliament enforced the IDRA which contains, inter alia, Section 18G which was inserted w.e.f. 01.10.1953, whereby the Central Government was empowered for securing equitable distribution and availability at fair prices of any article or class of articles relatable to any scheduled industry to provide for regulating the supply and distribution thereof, and trade and commerce therein by a notified . The notified was also to provide for controlling the prices at which such article or class of articles could be bought or sold. The said Act was amended in 1956. Item 26 was inserted in the First Schedule to the said Act and empowered the Central Government to control the “Fermentation Industries” including alcohol industries. 2078 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Under the UP Licences for the Possession of Denatured Spirit and Specially Denatured Spirit Rules, 1976, special licence for possession of denatured spirit for industrial purposes was required. “Special denatured spirit” was defined as spirit rendered “unfit for human consumption”. As per the Rules, licences for possession of denatured spirit including specially denatured spirit for industrial purposes were to be of three kinds – (i) Form FL 39; (ii) Form FL 40; and (iii) Form FL 41. 9.1.5 In that background, it was submitted on behalf of the Union of India that the legislative competence of the State enactments in various States will have to be determined with reference to following Entries in List I – 7, 52, 59, 84, 96, 97 and Entries in List II - 8, 24, 26, 27, 51, 52, 54, 56, 62 and Entries in List III - 19 and 33. That there is a dichotomy between Entry 84 – List I and Entry 51 – List II but this would not control the interpretation of other Entries. It was urged that there was no such dichotomy as regards Entry 8 – List II as it is not subject to Entry 52 – List I as the subject matters of these two Entries are different. That Entry 52 – List I deals with industries while Entry 8 – List II deals with “intoxicating liquors”. The power to levy taxes is to be read from the Entry relating to taxes and not from the general Entry. That industry is a topic of legislation left to the Parliament and to the State. Identifying of Entries is by reference to a declaration under Entry 7 – List I and Entry 52 – List I. The aspect of legislation with regard to subject matter of Entries is the topic “industry”. On the other hand, the subject matter of legislation under Entry 8 – List II is the topic “intoxicating liquors”. Therefore, according to the Union of India, there was no conflict. 9.1.6 In view of the above submission on behalf of the Union of India, the only question which was to be determined was, whether, “intoxicating liquors” in Entry 8 – List II is confined to potable liquor or includes all liquors.
