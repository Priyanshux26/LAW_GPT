Civil Appeal Nos. 7442-7444 of 2012 3. Facts in a nutshell relevant and essential for disposal of the appeals are noted hereinbelow. 4. The appellant-DSGMC was managing and operating a school, namely, Khalsa Boys Primary School (in short ‘school’), constructed by it in the premises of the Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, New Delhi. The school was initially started with 130 students, five teachers including the Headmistress, 2 peons and one helper. The school was receiving 95% grant from the NDMC and remaining 5% contribution was made by the appellant-DSGMC towards the budget of the school. Respondents No. 1, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were employed as the Headmistress, Assistant Teacher, Water Women, Sweeper-cum-Chowkidar, Chowkidar, respectively in the school. 5. It is claimed that over a period of time, the building of the school became old and dilapidated and also, considering the growing number of devotees visiting the Gurudwara, the appellant-DSGMC was finding it difficult to run the school on a day-to-day basis. The appellant-DSGMC, therefore, decided to shift the school from its existing location to a new premises i.e. at Mata Sundari College, Old Building, New Delhi. Since the school was receiving 95% grant from the NDMC, the appellant-DSGMC moved the NDMC seeking permission to shift the school. 1 Civil Appeal No(s). 7440-7441 of 2012 2 Civil Appeal No(s). 7442-7444 of 2012 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 653 New Delhi Municipal Council v. Manju Tomar and Other 6. Upon receiving information about the proposed shifting of the school by the appellant-DSGMC, the Headmistress and other staff of the school challenged the said proposal by filing Writ Petitions3 in the High Court of Delhi. An ex-parte stay dated 30th May, 2005 was passed by the learned Single Judge of High Court of Delhi, staying the proposed shifting of the school. However, in spite of the stay being granted and having been communicated, the appellant-DSGMC demolished a substantial part of the school building thereby, making it non-functional. Consequent to the demolition of the school building, the NDMC stopped the grant-in-aid under Rule 69 of the Delhi Education Act and Rules, 1973 (hereinafter after being referred to as ‘Delhi Education Rules’) on the reasoning that it was under an obligation to provide grant-in-aid to schools which fell within its territorial jurisdiction and that the alternate location selected by the appellant-DSGMC, i.e., Mata Sundari College was outside the jurisdiction of the NDMC.
