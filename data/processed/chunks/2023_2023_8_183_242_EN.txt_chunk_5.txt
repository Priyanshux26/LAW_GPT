It has been held that it is aimed at restituting a party that is adversely affected by a ‘Change in Law’ event and restore it to E its original economic position as if such a ‘Change in Law’ event had not taken place. The argument that there is no provision in the PPAs for payment of compound interest from the date when the ‘Change in Law’ event had occurred, has been specifically rejected by this Court. In view of this consistent position of law F and application of restitutionary principles and privity of contractual obligations between the parties as contained in the PPAs, the view taken by the learned APTEL with regard to carrying cost does not warrants interference.

Civil Appeal No. 11095 of 2018 and Civil Appeal Nos. 11910 - 11911 of 2018 B In these batch of appeals, insofar as the appeal of DNHDISCOM is concerned, they are aggrieved by the of the learned APTEL allowing Busy Season Surcharge and Development Surcharge, MoEF Notification on coal quality and Change in NCDP. They are also aggrieved by the finding of the C learned APTEL with regard to carrying cost. Insofar as the Busy Season Surcharge and Development Surcharge are concerned, they are issued under the Circulars/Notifications of Indian Railways. The notification on coal quality is issued by MoEF. All these are the instrumentalities of the State, and these would, therefore, amount to ‘Change in Law’. Insofar as rest of the claims, D which are concurrently allowed and disallowed by both the CERC and the learned APTEL, are concerned, in view of the s of this Court on this issue, as stated above, there is no-reason to interfere with the same, not noticing any perversity, arbitrariness and/or any contravention of the statutory provisions. The appeals E of both the Generator and the DNH-DISCOM are, therefore, liable to be dismissed. [Paras 132, 134, 135][231-G-H; 232-A, B-D] 10.
