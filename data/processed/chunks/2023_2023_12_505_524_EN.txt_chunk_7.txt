This approach was recently followed by this court in Rajo v. State of Bihar21 as well. 17 “77. Premature release. – (1) Well behaved, long term convicted prisoners may be prematurely released with the objective of their reformation and rehabilitation, by the Government, either suo moto or on the recommendations of an Advisory Committee as may be prescribed. (2) The Advisory Committee constituted as per sub-section (1) shall have the powers and duties, as may be prescribed”. 18 As per sub-clause (iv) to Rule 464 of the 2014 Rules, the Advisory Board is to consider life convicts on completion of 10 years imprisonment (with remission), unless excluded by Section 433-A CrPC, in which case they are to be considered after completion of 14 years actual imprisonment. 19 [2010] 3 SCR 716 [paras 35, 43]. 20 (2021) 9 SCC 292 [para 16]. 21 dated 25.08.2023 in Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 252/2023 [para 23]. 516 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 20.A fi ve-judge bench of this court, in Maru Ram, v. Union of India22, when considering application of Section 433-A CrPC, when the trial court had acquitted an accused prior to its insertion, but convicted by the appellate court subsequent to Section 433-A coming into force, held: “[…] When a person is convicted in appeal, it follows that the appellate Court has exercised its power in the place of the original court and the guilt, conviction and sentence must be substituted for and shall have retroactive eff ect from the date of of the trial Court. The appellate conviction must relate back to the date of the trial Court’s verdict and substitute it. In this view, even if the appellate Court reverses an earlier acquittal rendered before Section 433-A came into force but allows the appeal and convicts the accused, after Section 433-A came into force, such persons will also be entitled to the benefi t of the remission system prevailing prior to Section 433-A on the basis we have explained. An appeal is a continuation of an appellate as a replacement of the original .” 21. Therefore, applying the principles laid down in the decisions discussed above, the date of conviction, though actually on 06.01.1998 – i.e., the day of the High Court , is deemed to relate back to the date of the trial court , which was delivered on 23.03.1996. On this date (as was the case even in 1998 when the High Court passed its ), the 1958 Rules were in force. 22. Much like the 2014 Rules [see Rule 464(iv)], the 1958 Rules similarly entitle convicts who have completed 14 years, to be considered for premature release. Rule 545A is extracted below: “545A. ‘14-Year Rule’.– The cases of ** prisoners whose aggregate sentence is more than 20 years shall be committed together with the records specifi ed under Rule 545 for special s of Government as to their premature release or completion of 14 years of sentence including remission in each case. ** “Provided that where a sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed on conviction of a person for an off ence for which death is one of the 22 [1981] 1 SCR 1196 [para 20].
