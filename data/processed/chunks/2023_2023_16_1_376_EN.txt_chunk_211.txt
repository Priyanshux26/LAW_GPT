A negotiation between the rulers and the ruled, with a more democratic process, saw the promulgation of the Jammu & Kashmir Constitution Act, 1939 on 7.9.1939,33 with sovereignty and supremacy over all legislative, executive and judicial functions being retained by the Maharaja while empowering the Praja Sabha to make laws for the entire State of Jammu & Kashmir.34 Executive functions under the Act were vested with a Council consisting of the Prime Minister and such other Ministers as appointed by the Maharaja.35 The Act also provided for the establishment of a High Court (which, in fact, had already been established in 1928),36 which was to be a court of record with jurisdiction to adjudicate upon any original civil suits of value of Rupees ten thousand or more, and also civil, criminal and revenue appeals.37 31 VP Menon, The Story of the Integration of the Indian States (Orient Longmans Pvt.

Prelude 13. The Second World War and the independence movement made independence inevitable. The Cabinet Mission Plan of 16.5.1946 envisaged a Union of India where the Union would have responsibility over defence, foreign aff airs and communication and the States would retain jurisdiction over all other subjects not ceded to the Union.38 The Constituent Assembly of India on 22.1.1947 unanimously adopted the Objective Resolution declaring the Assembly’s “fi rm and solemn resolve to proclaim India as an Independent Sovereign Republic.” The Princely States that had joined the Union of India were to possess and retain the status of autonomous units, together with residuary powers, save and except such powers and functions as were vested or assigned to the Union. 14. On 3.6.1947, the Mountbatten Plan envisaged a partition of India with accession of Indian States to one dominion or the other (i.e. India or Pakistan). The deadline of 15.8.1947 was set for transferring power to an independent India.39 The State of Jammu & Kashmir had the biggest area in India with a predominantly Muslim population ruled by a Hindu King.40 It was the political acumen of Sardar Patel, assisted by V.P.
