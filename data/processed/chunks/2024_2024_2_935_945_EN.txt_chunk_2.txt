Mahadevi and Smt. Sharnamma, wife and daughter-in-law respectively of defendant No.1/Shivasharnappa, impleading the plaintiffs and the defendants as party. A compromise decree dated 14.10.2004 was passed by the Lok Adalat, District Legal Services Authority, Gulbarga. Thereafter, respondents No. 1 and 2 filed a fresh suit in 2005 seeking partition of the ancestral property. Though in the suit pleading was there with reference to the earlier compromise decree, however for the reasons best known to the plaintiffs, no challenge was made to the same. As a result of the passed by the High Court, the nature of the suit was changed from partition to declaration, which is impermissible. 3.1 Further in terms of proviso to VI Rule 17 CPC, no amendment could be allowed after commencement of the trial. In the case in hand, the suit was at the fag end, as fixed for arguments. 3.2 It was further submitted that the compromise decree was passed on 14.10.2004. In terms of the provisions of XXIII Rule 3 CPC, the same could be challenged only before the same Court and not before any other Court. 3.3 He further contended that there was a specific stand taken by the appellant/defendant No. 2 in the written statement that 4 First Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division) at Gulbarga 5 dated 31.05.2010 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 939 Basavaraj v. Indira and Others there being a compromise decree in existence, no relief may be admissible to respondents No. 1 and 2, unless that decree is challenged. The written statement was filed in August 2005, still no steps taken by the respondents No. 1 and 2 in that direction. Part of the suit property having been sold, an amendment was carried out in the plaint in July 2006 to implead the subsequent purchaser. Even at that stage, this relief was not sought. 3.4 It was further contended that the relief of declaration of compromise decree being null and void prayed for by way of amendment otherwise also was time barred as the compromise decree was passed on 14.10.2004. The application for amendment was filed on 08.02.2010. Even the court fee was sought to be affixed at the time of filing of application for amendment. 3.5 The application filed by respondents No. 1 and 2 did not meet the pre-conditions laid down in VI Rule 17 CPC for permitting respondents No. 1 and 2 to amend the pleadings at the fag end of the trial. No due diligence was pleaded. All what was stated was that there was oversight on the part of respondents No. 1 and 2/plaintiffs. 3.6 Referring to the parties who were there in the compromise decree, it was argued that some of them are not parties in the suit in question, hence otherwise also challenge to the compromise decree may not be maintainable. 3.7 In support of the arguments, reliance was placed upon the s of this Court in Revajeetu Builders and Developers v. Narayanaswamy and sons and others6 and Vidyabai and others v. Padmalatha and another7 4.
