The relief as claimed in one of the petitions bearing C.W.P. B No.32 of 2000 (Goel Bus Service Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh and others) is reproduced below: “(i) That the impugned Annexure-PA, PB, PC, PD, PE, dated 18thDecember, 1999, 23rdDecember, 1999, 6thJanuary, 2000, 12.2.2000 and 31st December, 1999 may kindly be quashed C and set aside; (ii) That Section 3-A, 3-C, 4-A, 5-A along with Schedule-III under Section 3-A may be struck down being ultra vires the Constitution of India. (iii) Any other relied as may be deemed just and proper keeping D in view the facts and circumstances of the case may also be granted in favour of the petitioner.” 5. The above provisions, validity of which was sought to be declared as ultra vires, were introduced vide HPMVT(A) Act 1999 as also vide HPMVT(A) Act 2001. Consequent to insertion of the E said provisions, State of Himachal Pradesh issued several notifications referred to above, which were also assailed in a large number of writ petitions. The High Court, vide impugned dated 06.07.2007, upheld the validity of all the Sections except Section 3A (3) under challenge as not offending either Part III or any other provision of F the Constitution of India. With respect to Section 3-A (3) it was held that in substance it imposes a penalty and as such could not be treated as regulatory or compensatory tax and was, therefore, beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature. It, further quashed the two notifications dated 06.01.2000 and 01.04.2000 being not in consonance with the scheme of the Constitution. It also struck down G the decision dated 01.01.2000 based upon negotiations held on 31.12.1999 relating to special Toll Tax, as they were held to be against statutory provisions of the Act. The operative portion of the impugned reads as follows: H 1 In short “HPMVT(A) Act 1999” THE STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH v. GOEL BUS SERVICE 891 KULLU ETC. ETC. [VIKRAM NATH, J.] “On account of the above reasoning and the findings, we are A of the view that Sections 3-A (1), (2), (4) and Section 3-C do not offend either the fundamental rights or any other provision of the Constitution of India, therefore, these are held not ultra vires of the Constitution. Since Section 3-A (3) in substance imposes a fine as held above, therefore, such a nature of B penalty can neither be treated as regulatory nor compensatory tax and is out of the legislature competence of the State and the subordinate legislation, that is the notifications dated 6.01.2000 and 1.04.2000 are based upon lump sum charges of the levy thus are not in consonance with the scheme of the Constitution, therefore, these are held to be ultra vires.
