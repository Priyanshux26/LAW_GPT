However, the principle of federal supremacy in Article 246(1) cannot be resorted to unless there is an “irreconcilable” conflict between the entries in the Union and State Lists. The said conflict has to be a “real” conflict. The non obstante clause in Article 246(1) operates only if reconciliation is impossible. As stated, the parliamentary legislation has supremacy as provided in Articles 246(1) and (2). This is of relevance when the field of legislation is in the Concurrent List. The Union and the State Legislatures have concurrent power with respect to the subjects enumerated in List III. [See Article 246(2).] Hence, the State Legislature has full power to legislate regarding subjects in the Concurrent List, subject to Article 254(2) i.e. provided the provisions of the State Act do not come in conflict with those of the Central Act on the subject. [See Amalgamated Electricity Co. 2162 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (Belgaum) Ltd. v. Municipal Committee, Ajmer [AIR 1969 SC 227 : (1969) 1 SCR 430]. Thus, the expression “subject to” in clauses (2) and (3) of Article 246 denotes supremacy of Parliament.” 18.3 In paragraph 43, it was observed as under: “43. Our Constitution gives supremacy to Parliament in the matter of making of the laws or legislating with respect to matters delineated in the three Lists. The principle of supremacy of Parliament, the distribution of legislative powers, the principle of exhaustive enumeration of matters in the three Lists are all to be seen in the context of making of laws and not in the context of commencement of the laws.” 18.4 Dealing with the question of repugnancy and the ways in which it would arise between Parliamentary legislation and States’ legislation, it was observed in paragraph 47 as under: “47. The question of repugnancy between parliamentary legislation and State legislation arises in two ways. First, where the legislations, though enacted with respect to matters in their allotted spheres, overlap and conflict. Second, where the two legislations are with respect to matters in the Concurrent List and there is a conflict. In both the situations, the parliamentary legislation will predominate, in the first, by virtue of non obstante clause in Article 246(1); in the second, by reason of Article 254(1).” 18.5 Ultimately, in paragraph 61, it was stated as under: “61. The entire above discussion on Articles 245, 246, 250, 251 is only to indicate that the word “made” has to be read in the context of the law-making process and, if so read, it is clear that to test repugnancy one has to go by the making of law and not by its commencement.” 18.6 On the facts of the said case, this Court held that on the enactment of the (Central) Chit Funds Act, 1982 on 19.08.1982, intending to occupy the entire field of chits under Entry 7 - List III, the State Legislature was denuded of its power to enact the Kerala Finance Act 7 of 2002.
