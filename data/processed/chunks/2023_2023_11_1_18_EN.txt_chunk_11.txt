Venkataraman v. Union of India [(1979) 2 SCC 491 : 1979 SCC (L&S) 216 : AIR 1979 SC 49] , State of A.P. v. Goverdhanlal Pitti [(2003) 4 SCC 739 : AIR 2003 SC 1941], BPL Ltd. v. S.P. Gururaja [(2003) 8 SCC 567] and W.B. SEB v. Dilip Kumar Ray [(2007) 14 SCC 568 : (2009) 1 SCC (L&S) 860] . )” 18 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. IMPUGNED S: 22. In any case, the decisions of the High Court rendered earlier do not stand in the way of the impugned amendments. They were with respect to sandstone alone, while in the impugned the High Court applied it to all the minor minerals. In the decision rendered by the High Court dated 13.03.2013 all the applications were directed to be considered as per the amended Rules. In fact, the reasoning of the High Court in the impugned is contrary to the earlier passed. The impugned Rules have been introduced in exercise of the power conferred under Section 15 of the 1957 Act. As held by this Court in the decisions referred supra, there is neither a right nor it gets vested through an application made over a Government land. Law does not facilitate hearing the parties in bringing an amendment by an authority competent to do so. The High Court, in our considered view, has totally misconstrued the issues ignoring the fact that there is a delegation of power to the fi rst appellant which was rightly exercised as conferred under Section 15 of the 1957 Act. 23. For the foregoing reasons, we have no hesitation in setting aside the impugned s and we do so. Accordingly, all these appeals stand allowed. Consequently, pending application(s), if any, also stand(s) disposed of. No costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals allowed. Nidhi Jain (Assisted by : Tamana, LCRA)
