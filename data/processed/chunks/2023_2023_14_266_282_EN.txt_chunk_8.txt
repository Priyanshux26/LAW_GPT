Of these, cases that are pending for more than 5 years are as many as 2,116, which fi gure is more than 40% of such pendencies. This is a large number. 14. These cases have a direct bearing on our political democracy. Hence, there is a compelling need to make every eff ort to ensure that these cases are taken up on priority and decided expeditiously. Confi dence and trust of the constituency in their political representative, be it an MP or an MLA, is necessary for an interactive, effi cient and eff ective functioning of a parliamentary democracy. However, such confi dence is diffi cult to expect when fi gures, as indicated in the above referred table, loom large in our polity. 15. In fact, there are no two views about the compelling need to take up and dispose of the subject cases expeditiously. We have no doubt in our mind that even the political representative, be it MP or an MLA, involved in the prosecution would also seek a quick disposal of these cases. However, the 280 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. problem lies elsewhere. It seems systemic, perhaps institutional, and takes within its sweep many factors including the method of adversarial litigation that we have adopted. Yet, at every stage of the practice and procedure that we adopt, there is scope for reform. It is in this context that we have earnestly conducted and monitored this case for the last seven years. 16. Having analyzed the all India data on the pendency of subject cases in States and Union Territories, we have at the outset noted a considerable asymmetric disposition between states and even between districts within a State, on factors that have a bearing on early disposal. This is evident from the stark diff erence that exists in the actual number of pending cases between States and even districts within States.
