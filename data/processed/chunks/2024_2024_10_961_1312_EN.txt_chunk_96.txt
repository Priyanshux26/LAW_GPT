1099 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 of such detection. Such application must be made within 30 days of the appointment of the Registering Authority. iv. The Registering Authority would thereafter enter the particulars of the application in Form XIX and return a copy of the application under his seal to the applicant. v. The Authority would send such a copy of the application to the Central and State governments with a quarterly return in Form XX. vi. Further, as per Section 6A(4), a person registered under the process mentioned above would be entitled from the date of his detection as a foreigner and till the expiry of ten years from that date, the same rights and obligations as an Indian citizen except for the right to vote. vii. Rule 20 of the Citizenship Rules, 2009 also allows the Registering Authority to make a fresh reference to the Tribunals upon receipt of an application from an applicant when any question arises whether such person fulfils the necessary criteria or the Tribunal has not recorded a finding to that effect. 238. From the above, it is clear that there are legibly delineated conditions and a reasonable process envisaged under Section 6A and the Citizenship Rules, 2009 for migrants who came before 01.01.1966, as well as for those who came on or after 01.01.1966 and before 25.03.1971. 239. Still further, apart from these conditions prescribed within Section 6A itself, various other statutes supplement the issue of migrants in Assam. As will be detailed in the later part of this judgement under Issue xi (Citizenship Act vis- à-vis the IEAA) (infra), these statutes include the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950, Foreigners Act, 1946, the Foreigners (Tribunals) , 1964, the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and the Passport Act, 1967. In these statutes, the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950 prescribes the mechanism for the expulsion of immigrants acting against the public interest, and the Foreigners Act, 1946 as well as the Foreigners (Tribunals) , 1964 prescribe, inter alia, the mechanism for detection of foreigners, the norms regarding their stay in India before they are granted citizenship, and deportation of 1100 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports illegal immigrants post-1971. Additionally, the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 can also be used to penalize illegal immigrants who entered India without a valid passport. The Passport Act, 1967 can be used for penalizing immigrants travelling out of India without such a passport. 240. The above statutes, for the reasons assigned in the later part, supplement Section 6A and are to be read together to create a harmonious code. The process which runs through all of these legislations does not appear to be capricious or irrational. We cannot therefore approve the Petitioners’ approach of singularly reading Section 6A in isolation, calling it incomplete and terming it manifestly arbitrary for not prescribing all conditions exhaustively. 241. There also appears to be an explicit and legitimate reason behind the process of segregating migrants into different classes, as provided in Section 6A.
