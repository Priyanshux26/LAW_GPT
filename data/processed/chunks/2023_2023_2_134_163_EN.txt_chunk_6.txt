A 9. Within a few days of registration of the FIR, on 28th February, 2020 to be precise, AS applied for an amendment of WPCR 88/2020 seeking to mount a challenge to the FIR. He had also applied for interim relief for stay of effect/operation of the FIR. 10. YS too, on 2nd March, 2020, instituted WPCR 154/2020 seeking B an , inter alia, for quashing of the FIR. 11. By an dated 28th February, 2020, the High Court allowed the application for amendment and also directed that no coercive steps be taken against AS till the next date of hearing. 12. On 15th April, 2020, WPCR 206/2020 was jointly instituted by C AS and YS seeking appropriate for listing of WPCR 88/2020 and WPCR 154/2020 for final hearing immediately upon resumption of normal functioning of the Court (which was then curtailed due to the pandemic caused by Covid-19) and also for an declaring the action of the ACB/EOW in directing HDFC Bank Ltd., respondent no.5, to put a hold on the funds in the salary account of AS, as void and illegal. D 13. We need not at this stage refer in detail to the intervening events of issuance of notice to AS to join the investigation as well as interim s passed on the writ petitions from time to time. Suffice it to note, in an dated 6th September, 2021, the High Court observed that there was a dispute with regard to the income of AS and YS and the E ACB/EOW was called upon to produce the case diary as well as figures in tabulated form showing income and expenditure for perusal by the Court whether there is disproportionate income or not. 14. Faced with such an , the State filed an application seeking exemption to produce the case diary and the figures in tabulated form as F well as applied for vacation of an earlier dated 28th February, 2020 whereby the ACB/EOW was restrained from taking coercive steps against AS. The fate of these applications does not clearly appear from the records. However, for the reasons recorded in the impugned and dated 10th January, 2022, the High Court while allowing WPCR G 88/2020 quashed the FIR. In view of the FIR having been quashed, the High Court held that relief sought by YS in WPCR 154/ 2020 in relation to the FIR had lost its significance. However, the Court rejected the prayer of YS to prosecute US, the original complainant and J.P. Kujur, the Investigation Officer, under section 211, IPC. WPCR 154/2020, thus, stood partly allowed. Insofar as WPCR 206/2020 is concerned, the Court H THE STATE OF CHATTISGARH & ANR. v. AMAN KUMAR 143 SINGH & ORS. ETC. ETC [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] made the following directions in paragraph 70: A “70. Since this Court while hearing WPCR No. 88 of 2020 has already quashed the FIR bearing No. 09/2020 registered against the petitioners at Police Station- EOW/ACB, District- Raipur (C.G. ), therefore, the relief sought in this petition has lost its significance and the bank account No.
