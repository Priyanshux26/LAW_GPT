VISHNU KUMAR SHUKLA & ANR. v. THE STATE OF UTTAR 1077 PRADESH & ANR. [AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, J.] CrPC, in Case No. U/S 482/378/407 No. - 2413 of 2012 which was disposed of vide dated 10.04.2014 with the direction that the appellants may fi le application for discharge before the Court concerned. 8. It was submitted that on 18.12.2014, the Civil Judge (Junior Division), South, Lucknow in Miscellaneous Suit No.540031 C/2012, which was instituted on the application fi led by the appellants under Section 340, CrPC, prima facie found that off ence under Section 4638, IPC had been committed by R2 and directed initiation of proceedings against him. 9. Furthermore, it was pointed out that in terms of the High Court’s dated 10.04.2014, the appellants on 16.01.2016 fi led application for discharge before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow, in Case Crime No.368 of 2011, wherein one of the grounds taken was the dated 18.12.2014 passed by the Civil Judge (Junior Division), South, Lucknow. 10. Learned counsel submitted that dated 18.12.2014 was a clear-cut fi nding by a Court of Law that the entire suit was premised on forged and fabricated document(s). He submitted that once the same has been established, the contention of R2 to be in possession of the property in question does not arise and clearly the FIR itself was a misuse and abuse of the process of law. Learned counsel submitted that despite there being suffi cient material for discharge, the Trial Court by dated 02.06.2017 rejected the application on vague grounds and thus, the appellants had to move the High Court under Section 482, CrPC in Case U/S 482/378/407 Cr.P.C. No.4929 of 2017, which was dismissed by the Impugned . 11. Learned counsel pointed out that innocence of the appellants would be further established by the fact that despite the initial FIR having been registered under Sections 448, 454 and 380, IPC, the police did not fi nd any case under Sections 454 and 380, IPC, to which R2 neither objected nor 8 463.
