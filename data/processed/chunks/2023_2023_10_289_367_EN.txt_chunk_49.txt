This is also clear from the Government dated 7th August, 1990 which was notified by the Government of Sikkim to the effect that every person who immediately before 26th April, 1975, was a Sikkim Subject under 1961 Regulation, D shall be deemed to have become a citizen of India on that day. In fact, where there were genuine omissions, a direction was issued to enter all such eligible persons who had been omitted in the said Register. To the same effect is the Government issued by the Government of India dated 8th April, 1991 which was notified by the Government of Sikkim E on the same date. 63. Therefore, on a conspectus consideration of the 1961 Regulation in light of the Government s passed subsequent to the merger of Sikkim with India by which Sikkim became a State in India and by which the Sikkim Subjects domiciled in Sikkim had their names F included in the Register of Sikkim Subjects, the proviso should not have discriminated against Sikkimese women in the manner analysed above, only because a Sikkimese woman who, though, may have had her name registered in the Register of Sikkim Subjects, married a non-Sikkimese, that too, only on or after, 1st April, 2008, would be excluded from the exemption clause. Such a category of women cannot be deprived of the G benefit of the provision under Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961. 64. In fact, in my view, the proviso runs counter to the Explanation and is thus manifestly arbitrary. This is because the Explanation intends to give the benefit of Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 to all Sikkimese who are defined under the said Explanation as those H ASSOCIATION OF OLD SETTLERS OF SIKKIM AND ORS. v. 353 UNION OF INDIA AND ANR. [B. V. NAGARATHNA, J.] ‘individuals’ whose names have been recorded and registered in the A Register of Sikkim Subjects immediately before 26th April, 1975 or included pursuant to the Government of India No. 26030/36/90/ I.C.I. dated 7th August, 1990 and of even number dated 8th April, 1991, or those persons whose names do not appear in the Register of Sikkim Subjects but it has been established that the name of such B individual’s father or husband or paternal grandfather or brother from the same father had been recorded in that Register. Hence, the benefit of the Explanation must be extended to all Sikkimese women, irrespective of whether they have married a Sikkimese or a non-Sikkimese after the 1st April, 2008. C 65. Thus, in view of the aforesaid discussion, the proviso to Clause (26AAA) of Section 10 of the I.T. Act, 1961 is struck down as being in violation of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India. Challenge to the Explanation: 66. For the purpose of Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961, D the meaning of ‘Sikkimese’ is of significance inasmuch as it is only a ‘Sikkimese’ who is entitled to the benefit under the said Act.
