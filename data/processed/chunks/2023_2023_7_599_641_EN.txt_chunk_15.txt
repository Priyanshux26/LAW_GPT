Such a notice having been served on 4-6- 1980, it has to be seen whether the claims were in time as on that date. If the claims were barred on 4-6-1980, it follows that the claims had to be rejected by the arbitrator on the H M/S B AND T AG v. MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 621 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] ground that the claims were barred by limitation. The said A period has nothing to do with the period of limitation for filing a petition under Section 8(2) of the Act. Insofar as a petition under Section 8(2) is concerned, the cause of action would arise when the other party fails to comply with the notice invoking arbitration. Therefore, the period of limitation B for filing a petition under Section 8(2) seeking appointment of an arbitrator cannot be confused with the period of limitation for making a claim. The decisions of this Court in Major (Retd.) Inder Singh Rekhi v. DDA [(1988) 2 SCC 338], Panchu Gopal Bose v. Board of Trustees for Port of Calcutta [(1993) 4 SCC 338] and Utkal Commercial C Corpn. v. Central Coal Fields Ltd. [(1999) 2 SCC 571] also make this position clear.” (Emphasis supplied) 41. In SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd. and Another, reported in (2005) 8 SCC 618, this Court held that dragging a party to an arbitration when there existed no arbitrable dispute, can certainly affect D the right of that party, and, even on monetary terms, impose on him a serious liability for meeting the expenses of the arbitration. 42. Whether time barred claims should be referred to for decision in the arbitration proceedings was looked into by this Court in National Insurance Company Limited v. Boghara Polyfab Private Limited, E reported in (2009) 1 SCC 267. Paras 22 to 22.2 respectively of the said read as under: “22. Where the intervention of the court is sought for appointment of an Arbitral Tribunal under Section 11, the duty of the Chief Justice or his designate is defined in SBP & F Co. [(2005) 8 SCC 618] This Court identified and segregated the preliminary issues that may arise for consideration in an application under Section 11 of the Act into three categories, that is, (i) issues which the Chief Justice or his designate is bound to decide; (ii) issues which he can also decide, that is, issues which he may choose to decide; and (iii) issues which G should be left to the Arbitral Tribunal to decide. 22.1. The issues (first category) which the Chief Justice/his designate will have to decide are: (a) Whether the party making the application has approached the appropriate High Court. H 622 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A (b) Whether there is an arbitration agreement and whether the party who has applied under Section 11 of the Act, is a party to such an agreement. 22.2. The issues (second category) which the Chief Justice/ his designate may choose to decide (or leave them to the B decision of the Arbitral Tribunal) are: (a) Whether the claim is a dead (long-barred) claim or a live claim.
