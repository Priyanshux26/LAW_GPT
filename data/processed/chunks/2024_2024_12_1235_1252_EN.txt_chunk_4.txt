They argue that their duties were neither sporadic nor project- based but permanent and integral to the daily functioning of the respondent’s offices. (ii). Nature of Duties: Their responsibilities—such as cleaning, dusting, gardening, and other maintenance tasks—were not casual or peripheral. Instead, they were central to ensuring a clean, ly, and functional work environment, effectively aligning with roles typically associated with regular posts. (iii). Absence of Performance Issues: Throughout their tenure, the appellants were never issued any warning or adverse remarks. They highlight that their work was consistently satisfactory, and there was no indication from the respondents that their performance was not satisfactory or required improvement. 3 [2006] 3 SCR 953 : (2006) 4 SCC 1 1242 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (iv). Compliance with ‘Uma Devi’ Guidelines: The appellants assert that their appointments were not “illegal” but at most “irregular.” Drawing on the principles laid down in Secretary, State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi,4 they submit that long- serving employees in irregular appointments—who fulfil essential, sanctioned functions—are entitled to consideration for regularization. (v). Discrimination in Regularization: The appellants point out that individuals with fewer years of service or similar engagements have been regularized. They contend that denying them the same benefit, despite their longer service and crucial role, constitutes arbitrary and discriminatory treatment. (vi). Irrelevance of Educational Qualifications: The appellants reject the respondents’ reliance on formal educational requirements, noting that such criteria were never enforced earlier and that the nature of their work does not inherently demand formal schooling. They argue that retrospectively imposing such qualifications is unjustified given their proven capability over many years. (vii). Equity and Fairness: Ultimately, the appellants submit that the High Court erred by focusing too rigidly on their initial terms of engagement and ignoring the substantive reality of their long, integral service. They maintain that fairness, equity, and established judicial principles call for their regularization rather than abrupt termination 9. On the other hand, the following primary arguments have been advanced before us on behalf of the Respondents: (i). Nature of Engagement: The respondents maintain that the appellants were engaged purely on a part-time, contractual basis, limited to a few hours a day, and that their work was never intended to be permanent or full-time. (ii). Absence of Sanctioned Posts: They assert that the appellants were not appointed against any sanctioned posts. According to 4 [2006] 3 SCR 953 : (2006) 4 SCC 1 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1243 Jaggo v. Union of India & Ors. the respondents, without sanctioned vacancies, there can be no question of regularization or absorption into the permanent workforce. (iii). Non-Compliance with ‘Uma Devi’ Criteria: Relying heavily on Secretary, State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi (supra), the respondents argue that the appellants do not meet the conditions necessary for regularization. They emphasize that merely serving a long period on a part-time or ad-hoc basis does not create a right to be regularized. (iv). Educational Qualifications: The respondents contend that even if the appellants were to be considered for regular appointments, they do not possess the minimum educational qualifications mandated for regular recruitment.
