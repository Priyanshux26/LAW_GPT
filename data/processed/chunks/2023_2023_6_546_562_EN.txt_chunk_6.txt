Section 123 of the RP Act of 1951 defines various corrupt practices for the purpose of the said enactment. Naturally, 4 (1999) 3 SCC 737 5 (2012) 7 SCC 788 6 (1960) 3 SCR 91 H 554 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A the corrupt practice has to be qua the election subject matter of challenge in the Election Petition. 10. Now, coming to the Election Petition filed by the first respondent, paragraphs 1 and 2 are formal paragraphs which contain the first respondent’s address and description of the respondents. B Paragraph 3 only records that by a notification dated 16th October 2016, the Election Commission announced the election for the said Constituency. Paragraph 4 quotes the of the Election Commission by which the election earlier scheduled was postponed due to reasons incorporated in the said . Paragraphs 3 and 4 are completely irrelevant to adjudicate upon the grounds pleaded in the Election Petition. C 11. In paragraph 5, the first respondent has relied upon the representation made by her on 3rd November 2016 to the Returning Officer by pointing out that the appellant and 6th respondent have committed misconduct by suppressing the findings of the Election Commission recorded in the dated 27th May 2016. The first D respondent called upon the Returning Officer to disqualify the appellant and the 6th respondent. It is further stated that the representation was rejected by communication dated 5th November 2011. Therefore, the first respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court which was dismissed by the dated 18th November 2016 with costs of Rs.3,000/- on the E first respondent. Presumably, paragraph 5 of the petition is in support of the ground of improper acceptance of the nomination papers of the appellant. However, the first respondent has not pleaded that under a particular statutory provision, the appellant and 6th respondent were under an obligation to disclose the dated 27th May 2016 passed by the Election Commission while filing nomination papers. It is not pleaded F how on the ground of the failure to disclose the said , the appellant and 6th respondent were disqualified from contesting the election. The disqualification must be based on a statutory provision. The first respondent has not pleaded that in law it was the obligation of the appellant to disclose in the nomination paper, the earlier of the Election G Commission by which the election was postponed. The existence of no such obligation is pleaded. Therefore, in our view, averments made in paragraphs nos. 4 and 5 of the Election Petition are unnecessary, thereby, attracting clause (a) of Rule 16 of VI of CPC. Under clause (a) of Rule 16 of VI of CPC, the Court has the power to strike out a pleading which is unnecessary. H SENTHIBALAJI V. v. A.P. GEETHA AND ORS. 555 [ABHAY S. OKA, J.] 12. We will have to examine the averments regarding corrupt A practice in the light of Section 83 of R.P. Act of 1951 which reads thus: “83.
