This amendment to Section 125 of the CrPC being subsequent to the enforcement of the 1986 Act, is so 1306 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports significant that it virtually makes Section 3 of the 1986 Act very narrow and insignificant although the expression “provision” under Section 3(1) of the 1986 Act has been broadly interpreted by this Court in Danial Latifi. v. I, therefore, hold that Section 125 of the CrPC cannot be excluded from its application to a divorced Muslim woman irrespective of the law under which she is divorced. There cannot be disparity in receiving maintenance on the basis of the law under which a woman is married or divorced. The same cannot be a basis for discriminating a divorced woman entitled to maintenance as per the conditions stipulated under Section 125 of the CrPC or any personal or other law such as the 1986 Act. I also note that although the provisions of the 1986 Act have been upheld by a Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Danial Latifi, the same would not in any way restrict the application of Section 125 of the CrPC to a divorced Muslim woman. vi. Further, under Section 5 of the 1986 Act, if, on the date of the first hearing of the application under sub-section (2) of Section 3, a divorced woman and her husband declare by an affidavit or any other declaration in writing in the form prescribed, either jointly or separately that they would prefer to be governed by the provisions of Section 125 to Section 128 of the CrPC and file such an affidavit or declaration in the Court hearing the application, the Magistrate shall dispose of such application accordingly. Therefore, the 1986 Act itself provides for the applicability of Sections 125 to 128 of the CrPC, even when an application under sub-section (2) of Section 3 is made seeking relief as per sub-section (1) of Section 3. However, the said option given to the divorced woman and her former husband mandates that there must be a declaration which is ad idem for the purpose of applying the provisions of Sections 125 to 128 of the CrPC, when an application is made under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the 1986 Act. This would imply that if there is no such declaration given then Sections 125 to 128 of the CrPC would not apply when an application is made under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the 1986 Act by a divorced Muslim woman. This again puts a fetter on the applicability of Sections 125 to 128 of the CrPC to such a divorced woman inasmuch it is necessary for her former husband to concur to be governed by the provisions of Sections [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1307 Mohd. Abdul Samad v. The State of Telangana & Anr. 125 to 128 of the CrPC. This means that an option is given to the former husband of a divorced Muslim woman to concur or not to do so.
