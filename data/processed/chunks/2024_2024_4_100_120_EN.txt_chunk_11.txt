Adyanthaya [(1994) 5 SCC 737 : 1994 SCC (L&S) 1283] and the two-Judge Bench, though has referred to S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] and Mukesh K. Tripathi [(2004) 8 SCC 387 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1128] but has not taken note of what the three-Judge Bench has said in Mukesh K. Tripathi [(2004) 8 SCC 387 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1128] with regard to the precedent and how S.K. Verma case [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] is no more a binding precedent. 15. In our considered opinion, the decision in R. Suresh [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] cannot be regarded as the precedent for the proposition that a Development Officer in LIC is a “workman”. In fact, the does not say so but Mr Vasdev, the learned Senior Counsel would submit that inferring such a ratio, cases are being decided by the High Courts and other authorities. Though such an apprehension should not be there, yet to clarify the position, we may quote a few lines from Ambica Quarry Works v. State of Gujarat [(1987) 1 SCC 213 : AIR 1987 SC 1073] : (SCC p. 221, para 18) “18. … It has been said long time ago that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides, and not what logically follows from it. (See Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathem [1901 AC 495 : (1900-03) All ER Rep 1 (HL)] . )” In view of the aforesaid, any kind of interference is not permissible but, a pregnant one, it has dealt with the cases of Development Officers of LIC. 16. As we find, the said R. Suresh [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] has been rendered in ignorance of the ratio laid down by the Constitution Bench in H.R. Adyanthaya [(1994) 5 SCC 737 : 1994 SCC (L&S) 1283] and also the principle stated by the three-Judge Bench in Mukesh K. Tripathi [(2004) 8 SCC 387 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1128] that the decision in S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] is not a precedent, and hence, we are compelled to hold that the pronouncement in R. Suresh [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] is per incuriam. We say so on the basis of the decisions rendered in A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak [(1988) 2 SCC 602 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 372] , Punjab Land Development and Reclamation Corpn. Ltd. v. Labour Court [(1990) 3 SCC 682 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 71] , State of U.P. v. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. [(1991) 4 SCC 139] and Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra [(2011) 1 SCC 694 : (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 514] .’ 112 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 12. Learned counsel summed up his arguments by pointing out that the Labour Court had rightly noticed Clause 5.5 of the respondent’s Appointment Letter which starts with “being a managerial cadre employee you will be………”, which should leave no manner of doubt that the respondent cannot come within the definition under Section 2(s), ID Act and his post/position was a pure managerial position.
