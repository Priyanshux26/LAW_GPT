In Tuck & Sons v. Priester reported in (1887) 19 QBD 629 (CA), which was followed in London and Country Commercial Properties [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1145 Shajan Skaria v. The State of Kerala & Anr. Investments Ltd. v. Attorney General reported in (1953) 1 WLR 312 : (1953) 1 All ER 436, it was observed thus: “We must be very careful in construing that section, because it imposes a penalty. If there is a reasonable interpretation, which will avoid the penalty in any particular case, we must adopt that construction. Unless penalties are imposed in clear terms, they are not enforceable. Also, where various interpretations of a section are admissible it is a strong reason against adopting a particular interpretation if it shall appear that the result would be unreasonable or oppressive.” (Emphasis supplied) 86. Blackburn, J. in Willis v. Thorp reported in (1875) LR 10 QB 383 observed that “when the legislature imposes a penalty, the words imposing it must be clear and distinct.” 87. We have construed Section 18 of the Act, 1989 keeping in mind the aforesaid principles of statutory construction. We are of the view that taking any other view than the one taken by us would be unreasonable, oppressive and not in tune with the consecrated principles of our Constitution. H. CONCLUSION 88. For all the foregoing reasons, this appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The impugned passed by the High Court is hereby set aside. 89. We direct that in the event of arrest of the appellant by police in connection with the First Information Report No. 899 of 2023 lodged at the Elamakkara Police Station, he shall be released on bail subject to terms and conditions, which the Investigating Officer may deem fit to impose. 90. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
