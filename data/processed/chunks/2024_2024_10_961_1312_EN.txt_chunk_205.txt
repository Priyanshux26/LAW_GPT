The Part on Citizenship consisted of three provisions. The first provision prescribed who would be citizens of India on the date of the commencement of the Constitution.16 The second provision stipulated who would be citizens after the commencement of the Constitution.17 The provision recognised citizenship by birth, citizenship by naturalization and citizenship by descent. The third provision stipulated that further provisions governing the acquisition and termination of federal citizenship may be made by Federal law.18 It was, however, observed in the Note appended to the Memorandum that the second clause was not necessary since (a) it would be impossible to exhaustively define the conditions of nationality, birth or naturalisation in the Constitution; and (b) there may be some difficulty in the interpretation of the provisions of legislation on citizenship if the provisions were entrenched in the Constitution.19 The ad-hoc Committee on Citizenship slightly altered the first clause,20 agreed 15 BR Ambedkar in Constituent Assembly Debates (10 August 1949). “Except one other Article in the Draft Constitution, I do not think that any other article has given the Drafting Committee such a headache as this particular article. I do not know how many drafts were prepared and how many were destroyed as being inadequate to cover all the cases which it was thought necessary and desirable to cover.” 16 B Shiva Rao, The framing of India’s Constitution: Select Documents (Part II), 472 “At the date of commencement of this Constitution:- Every person domiciled in the territories subject to the jurisdiction of the federation- (a) Who has been ordinarily resident in those territories for not less than five years immediately preceding that date, or (b) Who, or whose parents, or either of whose parents, was or were born in India, Shall be a citizen of the Federation. Provided that any such person being a citizen of any State may, in accordance with Federal law, elect not to accept the citizenship hereby conferred.” 17 B Shiva Rao, The framing of India’s Constitution: Select Documents (Part II), 472 “After the commencement of this Constitution- (a) Every person who is born in the territories subject to the jurisdiction of the federation; (b) Every person who is naturalized in accordance with Federal law; and (c) Every person, either of whose parents was, at the time of such person’s birth, a citizen of the Federation” 18 B Shiva Rao, The framing of India’s Constitution: Select Documents (Part II), 473 “Further provisions governing the acquisition and termination of Federal citizenship may be made by Federal Law.” 19 See the Constitution of the Irish Free State; Article 3 20 B Shiva Rao, The framing of India’s Constitution: Select Documents (Part II), 683 “At the date of commencement of this Constitution, every person who: (a) Who or whose parents or either of whose parents, was or were born in the territories of the Federation and subject to its jurisdiction, or (b) who is domiciled in the territories subject to the jurisdiction of the federation.” The clause granting citizenship to those who have been ordinarily resident for five years was removed.
