Mere absence of motive would not impinge on the testimony of a reliable eye- witness. Motive is an important factor for consideration in a case of circumstantial evidence. But when there is direct eye witness, motive is not significant. This is what was held: “In case the prosecution is not able to discover an impelling motive, that could not reflect upon the credibility of a witness proved to be a reliable eye-witness. Evidence as to motive would, no doubt, go a long way in cases wholly dependent on circumstantial evidence. Such evidence would form one of the links in the chain of circumstantial evidence in such a case. But that would not be so in cases where there are eye-witnesses of credibility, though even in such cases if a motive is properly proved, such proof would strengthen the prosecution case and fortify the court in its ultimate conclusion. But that does not mean that if motive is not established, the evidence of an eye-witness is rendered untrustworthy” The principle that the lack or absence of motive is inconsequential when direct evidence establishes the crime has been reiterated by [2024] 4 S.C.R. 99 Chandan v. The State (Delhi Admn.) this Court in Bikau Pandey v. State of Bihar, (2003) 12 SCC 616; Rajagopal v. Muthupandi, (2017) 11 SCC 120; Yogesh Singh v. Mahabeer Singh, (2017) 11 SCC 195. 6. In view of above, we see no reason to interfere with the s of the Trial Court and that of the High Court, accordingly the appeal is dismissed. Interim dated 09.05.2012 granting bail to the appellant stands vacated. Appellant, who is presently on bail, is directed to surrender before the Trial Court within a period of four weeks from today. A copy of this shall be sent to the Trial Court to ensure that the appellant undergoes the remaining part of his sentence. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeal dismissed.
