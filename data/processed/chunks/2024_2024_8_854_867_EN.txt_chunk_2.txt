5. On 05.09.2016, pursuant to the Appellant’s application for the post of Assistant Professor in Law in the Unreserved category (UR), she was asked to appear before the Selection Committee. On 09.09.2016, a list of shortlisted candidates called for interview for the post of Assistant Professor along with the date and time for the interview was published. Insofar as the post of Assistant Professor (Law) was concerned, the time fixed was 12.30 PM on 21.09.2016 and about 16 candidates including the Appellant and one Sri. Brij Mohan Pandey were called for the interview. 6. On 20.11.2016, the 26th Meeting of the Executive Council of the University was held and the Agenda for consideration of the panel and names of persons recommended by the concerned Selection Committee for various teaching posts was taken up and approved. Insofar as the Assistant Professor in Law was concerned, the following was mentioned. 4. Assistant 2-UR (1 lien 21.09.2016 1. Brij Mohan Pandey Professor Vacancy) 2. Maitreyee in Law Chakraborty A note was appended below which reads as under :- “N.B. Candidate at Serial No 2 against the post of Assistant Professor in Law shall be given the offer of appointment against Lien Vacancy. In case the candidate at Serial No 1 does not accept the offer of appointment given to him against regular/ substantive vacancy, the post shall go to the candidate at Serial No 2 and Candidate at Serial No 3 on the approved panel shall be given the offer of appointment against the Lien Vacancy.” 7. As would be clear, at Serial Number No.1 was Sri. Brij Mohan Pandey and he was taken against the regular vacancy. The Appellant was adjusted against the Unreserved lien vacancy. There was a clear stipulation that in case Mr. Brij Mohan Pandey did not accept the 858 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports offer of appointment given to him against the regular/substantive vacancy, the post was to go to the Appellant who was at Serial No.2. It is another matter that Mr. Brij Mohan Pandey took up the appointment. However, this is significant because this fact negates the reasoning of the University, the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench that, what was advertised was only a lien vacancy and, as such, many meritorious candidates would not have applied. 8. Be that as it may, on 07.12.2016, an offer of appointment was made offering the Appellant the post of Assistant Professor in Law (UR) against lien vacancy. Paras 1 and 2 of the appointment letter are crucial and reads as under:- “In accordance with the decision of the 26th meeting of the Executive Council of the University held on 20th November, 2016, I am to inform you that you have been selected for appointment to the post of Assistant Professor in Law (UR) against Lien vacancy in the Pay Band of Rs. 15600-39100 plus Academic Grade Pay (AGP) of Rs. 6000 and other admissible allowances subject to the terms and conditions as set out herein and as amended from time to time.
