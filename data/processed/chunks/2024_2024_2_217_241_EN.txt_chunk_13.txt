75. Therefore, there is fundamental distinction between the principle laid down in K. Manjusree [K. Manjusree v. State of A.P., (2008) 3 SCC 512 : (2008) 1 SCC (L&S) 841] and followed in Hemani Malhotra [Hemani Malhotra v. High Court of Delhi, (2008) 7 SCC 11 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 203] on one hand and the situation in the present case on the other. [2024] 2 S.C.R. 237 Sushil Kumar Pandey & Ors. v. The High Court of Jharkhand & Anr. 76. We are then left with the question whether prescription of such minimum qualifying marks by dated 7-1- 2019 must be set aside merely because such prescription was done after the examination was conducted. At this juncture, it may be relevant to note that the basic prayer made in the leading writ petition before the Single Judge was to set aside the dated 7-1-2019. What could then entail as a consequence is that there would be no minimum qualifying marks for ATRE 2019, which would run counter to the mandate of Rule 2(1)(x) read with clause (c) of Rule 14. It is precisely for this reason that what was submitted was that the same norm as was available for ATRE 2018 must be adopted for ATRE 2019. In to lend force to this submission, it was argued that Shiksha Mitras who appeared in ATRE 2018 and ATRE 2019 formed a homogeneous class and, therefore, the norm that was available in ATRE 2018 must be applied. This argument, on the basis of homogeneity, has already been dealt with and rejected. 77. If the Government has the power to fix minimum qualifying marks “from time to time”, there is nothing in the Rules which can detract from the exercise of such power even after the examination is over, provided the exercise of such power is not actuated by any malice or ill will and is in furtherance of the object of finding the best available talent. In that respect, the instant matter is fully covered by the decisions of this Court in MCD v. Surender Singh [MCD v. Surender Singh, (2019) 8 SCC 67 : (2019) 2 SCC (L&S) 464] and Jharkhand Public Service Commission v. Manoj Kumar Gupta [Jharkhand Public Service Commission v. Manoj Kumar Gupta, (2019) 20 SCC 178] . In the first case, the power entrusted under Clause 25 of the advertisement also provided similar discretion to the Selection Board to fix minimum qualifying marks for each category of vacancies. While construing the exercise of such power, it was found by this Court that it was done “to ensure the minimum standard of the teachers that would be recruited”. Similarly, in Jharkhand Public Service Commission [Jharkhand Public Service 238 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Commission v. Manoj Kumar Gupta, (2019) 20 SCC 178], the exercise of power after the examination in Paper III was over, was found to be correct and justified. 78. If the ultimate object is to select the best available talent and there is a power to fix the minimum qualifying marks, in keeping with the law laid down by this Court in State of Haryana v. Subash Chander Marwaha [State of Haryana v. Subash Chander Marwaha, (1974) 3 SCC 220 : 1973 SCC (L&S) 488], State of U.P.
