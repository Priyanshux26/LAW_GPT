Sub-section (1) of Section 61 provided that the composition of the Chamber or Chambers of the Legislature of a Province shall be such as is specified in relation to that Province in the Fifth Schedule to the 1935 Act. 24. The First Schedule to the 1935 Act provided for “Composition of the Federal Legislature”. Clause 4 thereof inter alia provides for seats for representatives of the Scheduled Castes. 25. It will be relevant to reproduce Clause 8 of the First Schedule to the 1935 Act, which reads thus: “8. In any Province to which a seat to be filled by a representative of the scheduled castes is allotted, a person to fill that seat shall be chosen by the members of those castes who hold seats in the Chamber or, as the case may be, either Chamber of the Legislature of that Province.” 26. It could thus be seen that the 1935 Act provided that in any Province where seat(s) is/are to be filled by the representatives of the Scheduled Castes where they are so allotted, shall be chosen by the members of those castes who hold seats in the Chamber or either Chamber of the Legislature of that Province. 27. Clause 18 of the First Schedule deals with “The Federal Assembly”. 28. It could thus be seen that Clause 18 of First Schedule to the 1935 Act inter alia deals with seats reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes.
