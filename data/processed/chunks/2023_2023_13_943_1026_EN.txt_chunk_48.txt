59. In these kinds of circumstances, where the traditional assumptions underlying contract enforcement lose their justifi catory authority, the doctrine of unconscionability provides relief from improvident contracts. When unfair bargains cannot be linked to fair bargaining — when they cannot be attributed to one party’s “donative intent or assumed risk”, as Professor Benson puts it — courts can avoid the LOMBARDI ENGINEERING LTD. v. UTTARAKHAND JAL 1011 VIDYUT NIGAM LTD. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] inequitable eff ects of enforcement without endangering the core values on which freedom of contract is based (p. 182; see also Eisenberg, at pp. 799-801; S.M. Waddams, “Good Faith, Unconscionability and Reasonable Expectations” (1995) 9 J.C.L. 55, at p. 60). This explains how unconscionability lines up with traditional accounts of contract theory while recognizing the doctrine’s historical roots in equity, which has long operated as a “corrective to the harshness of the common law” (McCamus, at p. 10; see also Rotman, at pp. 503-4). 60. This Court has often described the purpose of unconscionability as the protection of vulnerable persons in transactions with others (Hodgkinson v. Simms, [1994] 3 SCR 377, at pp. 405 and 412; Hunter Engineering Co. v. Syncrude Canada Ltd., [1989] 1 SCR 426, at p. 462, per Dickson C.J., and p. 516, per Wilson J.; Norberg v. Wynrib, [1992] 2 SCR 226, at p. 247; see also Bhasin v. Hrynew, [2014] 3 SCR 494, at para. 43). We agree. Unconscionability, in our view, is meant to protect those who are vulnerable in the contracting process from loss or improvidence to that party in the bargain that was made (see Mindy Chen-Wishart, Unconscionable Bargains (1989), at p. 109; see also James Gordley, “Equality in Exchange” (1981) 69 Cal. L. Rev. 1587, at pp. 1629-34; Birch, at para. 44). Although other doctrines can provide relief from specifi c types of oppressive contractual terms, unconscionability allows courts to fi ll in gaps between the existing “islands of intervention” so that the “clause that is not quite a penalty clause or not quite an exemption clause or just outside the provisions of a statutory power to relieve will fall under the general power, and anomalous distinctions … will disappear” (S.M. Waddams, The Law of Contracts (7th ed. 2017), at p. 378). Xxx xxx xxx 70. The classic example of a “necessity” case is a rescue at sea scenario (see The Medina, [L.R.] 1 P.D. 272). The circumstances under which such agreements are made indicate the weaker party did not freely enter into the contract, as it was the product of his “extreme need … to relieve the straits in which he fi nds himself” (Bundy, at p. 339). Other situations of dependence also fi t this mould, including those where a party is vulnerable due to fi nancial desperation, or where 101 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. there is “a special relationship in which trust and confi dence has been reposed in the other party” (Norberg, at p. 250, quoting Christine Boyle and David R. Percy, Contracts : Cases and Commentaries (4th ed.
