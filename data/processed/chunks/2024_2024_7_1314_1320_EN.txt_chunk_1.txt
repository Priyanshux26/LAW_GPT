X) on 08.02.2023 for offences under Sections 21(c)/29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (for short ‘NDPS Act’). Anonymization as relates the identity of the respondent-accused as ‘Smt.X’ has been done, as she is Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive. Virtually, from 16.03.2023 onwards, Smt. X was in judicial custody in connection with the crime bearing FIR No.22(03)2023 registered at Khliehriat Police Station under Sections 21(c)/29 of the NDPS Act and her formal arrest in the subject Crime was recorded on 11.04.2023 during such custody. While so, as per the dated 27.06.2023, the High Court of Meghalaya at Shillong granted bail in connection with FIR No.22(03)2023 on the solitary ground of her being HIV positive. 3. It is the subsequent grant of bail on 29.09.2023 in connection with FIR No.06(02)23, sans satisfactory consideration of the twin conditions under Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act that constrained the State to approach this Court with the captioned Special Leave Petition. As a matter of fact, the bail application that culminated in the said dated 29.09.2023 was moved by the son of the accused-Smt.X, on her behalf. 4.

X, through whom B.A. No.38/2023 which culminated in the impugned was moved, did not enter appearance. Later, bailable warrant was issued against the Smt.X. The report annexed to the office report would reveal that bailable warrant was executed on 02.07.2024 and Smt.X was released on bail with the instructions to appear before this Court on 16.07.2024 at 10.30 a.m. However, the respondent-accused failed to appear before the Court when this matter was taken up for consideration. In this context, it is to be noted that in the impugned dated 29.09.2023, whereby Smt. X was granted bail, itself one of the conditions is that she should co-operate with the process of the court concerned. Be that as it may, we will now proceed to consider the challenge against the dated 29.09.2023. 5. There cannot be any doubt with respect to the position that in cases involving commercial quantity of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances, while considering the application of bail, the Court is [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1317 The State of Meghalaya v. Lalrintluanga Sailo & Anr. bound to ensure the satisfaction of conditions under Section 37(1) (b)(ii) of the NDPS Act.
