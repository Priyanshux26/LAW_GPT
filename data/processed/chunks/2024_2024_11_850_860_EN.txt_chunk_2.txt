The record reveals that the proceedings resumed in the year 2022, and in fact, the hearing was concluded on 05.05.2023. It is an admitted fact that the parties to the arbitration agreement have submitted before the Arbitral Tribunal that they would move the Court under Section 29A(4) of the Act for appropriate s for extension of time for making the award. In furtherance of the undertaking, an application under Section 29A(4) was filed by the appellant before the Gujarat High Court on 01.08.2023. 2 In re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation (2022) 3 SCC 117. 854 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 4. By the dated 03.11.2023 impugned before us, the High Court dismissed the application. The High Court reasoned that the initial statutory period of 12 months expired on 08.10.2020, and the same was extended by the mutual consent of the parties till 09.04.2021. Noting that the application for extension was preferred only in August 2023, High Court held that there is no explanation for a delay of more than 2 years, 4 months in approaching it. The High Court held that the mandate of the Arbitral Tribunal stood terminated on 09.04.2021, at which point there was not even an application for extension of time pending before it. In this view of the matter, the application was found to be misconceived, and was dismissed by the impugned before us. 5.

Further, he submits that the respondent had agreed to apply for extension of time before the Arbitral Tribunal, as is recorded in the Minutes of Arbitral Meeting dated 05.05.2023. 5.2 Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee, ASG, submits that even if the benefit of this Court’s is considered, the Tribunal’s mandate expired on 31.10.2022, and there is still a nine-month delay in filing the application.
