The Act also mandated creation of “a register of the names and residence of all eunuchs residing” in the territorial jurisdiction of the Act, “who are reasonably suspected of kidnapping or castrating children, or of committing offences under section [377] of Indian Penal Code, or of abetting the commission of any of the said offences”.155 The “eunuchs” were required to give information of their property.156 The Act further provided for arrest and punishment, including imprisonment up to two years, or fine, or both, of a “eunuch”, “who appears dressed or ornamented like a woman, in a public street” or even in a private space visible from a public street, or “dances or plays music, or takes part in any public exhibition, in a public street or place of for hire in a private house”.157 The Act imposed a penalty on a “eunuch”, if a boy under 16 years of age was found in his house or “under his control”.158 The Act also prohibited “eunuchs” of “being or acting as guardian to any minor”, “making a gift”, “making a will”, or “adopting a son”.159 151 Section 18(xii), Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. 152 Section 19, Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. 153 Section 20, Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. 154 Section 21, Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. 155 Section 24(a), Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. 156 Section 24(b), Section 30, Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. 157 Section 26, Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. 158 Section 27, Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. 159 Section 29, Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. 564 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 102. The provisions of the CTA were based on a stereotype which considered several marginalized communities as born criminals. By declaring them as born criminals and assuming that they are addicted to the commission of a crime, the Act restricted their life and identity in a negative way. The Act imposed unnecessary and disproportionate restrictions on their movement. It also took away the opportunity from them to settle in a place, as it was prescribed that they could be forced to move to another place decided by the government. This was forced nomadism. The Act, further, subjected the criminal tribes to heightened surveillance, as their movements were frequently and closely monitored. It also led to social discrimination, as it imposed a stigma of born criminality. At the same time, it gave extensive powers to local village headmen (generally higher caste) to collaborate with the police to report their movements. The Act was also based on a stereotype and further reinforced that “eunuchs” are suspected of kidnapping or castrating children. Thus, the impact of CTA was discriminatory and punitive. 103. The Act was first amended in 1876 to extend its operation to Bengal.160 The agents of landowners were also given the duty to inform the police about the presence or absence of any individual from a criminal tribe.161 The Act was then modified in 1897 to make the penalties more stringent Penalties for second and third convictions of individuals from the designated criminal tribes for specified offenses were imposed.162 The amendment also empowered the local governments “to separate children of the Criminal Tribes between the ages of 4 and 18 years from their irreclaimable parents” and “place them” in specially established “reformatory settlements”.163 104.
