10. We are afraid, the aforesaid argument advanced by learned counsel for the respondent-Bank is not persuasive. The language of Clause 6 of the Deposit Agreement makes it abundantly clear that the respondent- Bank was liable to refund the deposit amount contemporaneous to the Bank removing itself from the leased premises and handing over vacant possession thereof to the appellant-landlady and giving charge thereof to her, which procedure in the instant case, had not been followed. There is nothing on record to demonstrate that any steps were taken by the respondent-Bank calling upon the appellant- landlady to remain present at the subject premises for purposes of handing over/taking over possession of the leased premises on a particular date and time and giving charge thereof to her for her to refund the security deposit simultaneously to the respondent-Bank. 11. For the aforesaid reasons, we are unable to sustain the impugned dated 09th January, 2012 passed by the learned Single Judge that has upheld the dated 05th March, 2009, passed by the Appellate Rent Tribunal, Jaipur. However, the dated 30th July, 2015 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is maintained for the reason that no intra-court appeal could have been preferred by the appellant-Landlady against an passed by the learned Single Judge on a petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. As a result, Civil Appeal No. 6096 of 2017 is allowed, the dated 10th April, 2008 passed by the Rent Tribunal is restored and the decree passed in favour of the appellant-landlady is upheld. Civil Appeal No. 6097 of 2017 is however dismissed as there is no error in the finding returned by the Division Bench of the High Court regarding maintainability of an appeal against the dated 09th January, 2012, passed in proceedings under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Parties are left to bear their own expenses. Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey Result of the case: Civil Appeal No. 6096 of 2017 allowed; Civil Appeal No. 6097 of 2017 dismissed.
