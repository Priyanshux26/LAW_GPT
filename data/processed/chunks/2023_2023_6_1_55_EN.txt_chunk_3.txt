Whether cognizance has been taken or not taken is not relevant for the purpose of compliance of Section 167 CrPC. The mere filing of the chargesheet is sufficient. [Para 57][41-G] 1.7 Filing of a chargesheet is sufficient compliance with the B provisions of Section 167 CrPC and that an accused cannot claim any indefeasible right of being released on statutory/default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC on the ground that cognizance has not been taken before the expiry of the statutory time period to file the chargesheet. Grant of sanction is nowhere contemplated C under Section 167 CrPC. [Para 63][47-D-E] Ritu Chhabaria v. Union of India and Others, Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 60 of 2023 – distinguished. Suresh Kumar Bhikamchand Jain v. State of Maharashtra and Another (2013) 3 SCC 77 : [2013] 1 D SCR 1037; K. Veeraswami v. Union of India and Others (1991) 3 SCC 655 : [1991] 3 SCR 189 – relied on. Dinesh Dalmia v. CBI (2007) 8 SCC 770 : [2007] 9 SCR 1124; Central Bureau of Investigation v. Ashok Kumar Aggarwal (2014) 14 SCC 295 : [2013] 14 SCR E 983; Mohamed Iqbal Madar Sheikh and others v. State of Maharashtra (1996) 1 SCC 722 : [1996] 1 SCR 183; M. Ravindran v. Intelligence Officer, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (2021) 2 SCC 485 – referred to. F 2.1 The scheme of both the Acts-NIA and UAPA Act makes it clear that once the investigation is completed, the report under Section 173 CrPC is to be filed in the Special Court constituted under the Act. Section 16 of the NIA Act leaves no room for any doubt, as it empowers the Special Court to take cognizance of any offence without the accused being committed to it, for trial, G upon receiving a complaint of facts that constitute such offence or upon a police report of such facts. Thus, by incorporating Section 16 in the NIA Act the legislature has made the Special H 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A Court as the court of original jurisdiction unlike the Sessions Court, which is a court of committal under the Criminal Procedure Code. [Para 68][49-B-C] 2.2. The chargesheet could not have been filed in the Court of the SDJM and the same should have been filed in the Special B Court. Section 16 of the NIA Act empowers the Special Court to take cognizance of any offence without the accused being committed to it for trial, upon receiving a complaint of facts that constitute such an offence or upon a police report of such facts. The error on the part of the investigating agency in filing the chargesheet in the Court of SDJM and thereafter, committing C the case to the Court of Sessions has again nothing to do with Section 167 CrPC. The application seeking default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC read with Section 43D of the UAPA was filed before the Special Judge, NIA, Mohali, on 14.12.2020 and by that time, the chargesheet had already been filed and the D proceedings were pending in the court of Special Judge, CBI, Punjab, SAS Nagar, Mohali.
