185 [1999] EWCA Civ 3004 [25] [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2243 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company any question at issue in the proceedings before him the judge had expressed views, particularly in the course of the hearing, in such extreme and unbalanced terms as to throw doubt on his ability to try the issue with an objective judicial mind; or if, for any other reason, there were real ground for doubting the ability of the judge to ignore extraneous considerations, prejudices and predilections and bring an objective to bear on the issues before him.” (emphasis supplied) 97. In re Medicaments and Related Classes of Goods (No. 2),186 the Court of Appeal made a “modest adjustment” to the real danger of bias test laid down in Gough (supra) by holding that the court must determine whether the circumstances “would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility, or a real danger, the two being the same, that the tribunal was biased.” In Porter v. Magill,187 the House of Lords approved the adjustment made to the real danger of bias test. Lord Craighead stated the bias test thus: “103. […] The question is whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased.” 98. The shift in the bias test in the UK has “at its core the need for the confidence which must be inspired by the courts in a democratic society.”188 In Lawal v. Northern Spirit Limited,189 Lord Bingham observed that a “fair-minded and informed observer”190 will adopt a 186 [2001] 1 WLR 700 187 [2002] 2 AC 357 188 Lawal v. Northern Spirit Limited, [2003] UKHL 25 [14] 189 Northern Spirit Limited (supra) [14] 190 In Helow v. Secretary of State, [2008] UKHL 62. [Lord Hope of Craighead observed: “2. The observer who is fair-minded is the sort of person who always reserves on every point until she has seen and fully understood both sides of the argument. She is not unduly sensitive or suspicious, as Kirby J observed in Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488, 509, para 53. Her approach must not be confused with that of the person who has brought the complaint. The “real possibility” test ensures that there is this measure of detachment. The assumptions that the complainer makes are not to be attributed to the observer unless they can be justified objectively. But she is not complacent either. She knows that fairness requires that a judge must be, and must be seen to be, unbiased. She knows 2244 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports balanced approach and as “a reasonable member of the public is neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious.” The above discussion shows that the bias test has undergone significant development in the UK over the last four decades. The current bias test in the UK is the real possibility of a bias test.
