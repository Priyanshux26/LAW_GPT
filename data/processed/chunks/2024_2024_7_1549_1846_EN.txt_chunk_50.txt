The residuary power of Parliament also includes the power of making any law imposing a tax not mentioned in either List II or List III. 40. The legislative fields or entries in the Seventh Schedule have used general words to define and delineate the legislative powers of Parliament and State legislatures. The rule that words should receive their ordinary, natural, and grammatical meaning applicable to statutes also applies to the entries contained in the Seventh Schedule.38 It 36 Jindal Stainless Steel (supra) [120], [237.5], [639] 37 Godfrey Phillips India Ltd. v. State of UP (2005) 2 SCC 515 [46] 38 Navinchandra Mafatlal v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay City (1954) 3 SCC 623 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1615 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. is also a well-accepted principle that the entries should not be read in a narrow or pedantic sense but must be given their broadest meaning and the widest amplitude because they are intrinsic to a machinery of government.39 The ambit of the entries extends to all ancillary and subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in them.40 Since the Seventh Schedule uses general terms, there is always a possibility of an overlap and conflict between two or more entries. 41. Many entries in the Seventh Schedule may appear to overlap because of the language used in the entries. The necessary corollary to the scheme of legislative distribution is that that any invasion by Parliament in the field assigned to the States and vice versa is a breach of the Constitution.41 Even though the Constitution distributes legislative powers between the Union and the States, there have been situations where a legislation purporting to deal with a subject in one list, touches on a subject in another list. To remedy such situation, the doctrine of pith and substance is used to examine whether the legislature has the competence to enact a law with regard to either of the three lists under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.42 There may arise situations where a legislature may frame a law that in substance and reality transgresses its legislative competence. Such a piece of legislation is called “colourable legislation” because the legislature veils its transgression by making it seem as if the legislation is within its legislative competence.43 To examine whether the legislature has transgressed its legislative competence, the substance of the legislation is material. If the subject-matter is in substance beyond the legislative powers of the legislature, the form in which the law is clothed would not save it from the vice of unconstitutionality.44 39 Hans Muller of Nurenburg v.
