19. It is also required to be pointed out that the revised structure of pay of teachers and equivalent teachers in Universities and Colleges in Haryana, was issued by the Government of Haryana, Finance Department, on 27.08.2009, which was subsequently clarified on 02.09.2009. On the basis of the same, the employees / teachers working in the Government colleges received the revised pay. In the meanwhile, the Rules, 2009 relating to all pensioners / family pensioners, who were drawing their pension/ family pension or who were eligible / entitled to pension / family pension as on 01.01.2006, were notified on 17.04.2009, and they were deemed to have come into force with effect from 01.01.2006. As per Rule 6 of the Rules, 2009, and the subsequent clarification issued by the Higher Education Commissioner, Haryana, the person, who had completed 3 years of service in the pre-revised scale of pay and/ or the corresponding pay scale applicable prior to 01.01.1996, shall be placed in the minimum of the pay band of Rs.37400 – 67000 + AGP of Rs.9000/- for revision of pension / family pension, with effect from 01.01.2006. Pursuant to the same, the retired employees / Lecturers of the Government colleges started litigation in the year 2010, which attained finality in the year 2014 and consequently, they were paid the arrears of revised pension on 07.11.2014. Only thereafter, the appellants initiated the writ proceedings in the year 2015. Thus, it is manifestly clear that the appellants waited till the rights of the retired employees / Lecturers of the Government [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1747 K.C. Kaushik and Others v. State of Haryana and Others Colleges, were crystalised and thereafter, made representation to the respondent authorities and hence, they are not entitled to get any interest, by treating them as fence-sitters. Though there may be some lapses on the part of the officials representing the State in furnishing instructions about the case, to the Court, however that by itself will not give any room for the appellants to get unjust enrichment. 20. In view of the above stated reasons, we do not find any infirmity or illegality in the common passed by the High Court, setting aside the s of the learned Single Judge qua grant of interest on the belated payment of pension to the appellants. 21. Therefore, all the Appeals are devoid of merits and are accordingly dismissed. However, there is no as to costs. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. 22. Before parting, we wish to observe that each party should present truthful and accurate information to the court to facilitate fair adjudication. Such information should be provided in the form of writing. Relying on the oral instructions may lead to factual errors, misunderstanding / misrepresentations, etc., ultimately compromising the integrity of the judicial process. Misleading representations not only affect the parties involved, but also erode public trust in the judicial system as a whole. The Court should also pass s only based on the written instructions, so as to enable it to fix the liability on the correct official(s), responsible for any such wrongful representations / instructions.
