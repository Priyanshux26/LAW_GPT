20 (2011) 8 SCC 333 21 Law Commission of India, ‘Indian Stamp Act’ (67th Report, February,1997) available at https://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/report_seventh/accessed on 11March 2023 H 436 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A 23. Reflecting on the objective of the Stamp Act, 1899, a 3-judge bench of this Court in Hindustan Steel Ltd. v. Dilip Construction Co.22 (for short “Hindustan Steel”) speaking through J.C. Shah J. made the following pertinent observation: “7. The Stamp Act is a ûscal measure enacted to secure revenue B for the State on certain classes of instruments: It is not enacted to arm a litigant with a weapon of technicality to meet the case of his opponent.” 24. Learned Amicus Curiae, Mr. Gourab Banerjee cited the decision of the Pakistan Supreme Court in Union Insurance Company C of Pakistan Ltd. v Hafiz Muhammad Siddique23 which addressed this issue as early as 1978, following the ratio in Hindustan Steel (supra). Faced with the question of whether there would be any valid arbitral proceedings, if the arbitration agreement is unduly stamped and hence, inadmissible in evidence under Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899; the Court attributed a purely fiscal purpose to stamping, holding that stamping D is not meant to interfere in commercial life. Discussing the provisions of the Stamp Act, 1899 including Section 61 which empowers appellate Courts to revise decisions on “sufficiency” of stamps, Dorab Patel J concluded that: “the object of the legislature in enacting the Stamp Act was to E protect public revenue and not to interfere with commercial life by invalidating instruments vital to the smooth flow of trade and commerce.” [emphasis supplied] 25. Thus, the object is to see that the revenue for the State is F realised to the utmost extent24 and not to affect the validity of the document. Its provisions must be construed narrowly to that extent. In the same , it was elaborated by the Pakistan Supreme Court as under: “For example, an instrument would be produced in evidence only G when there is a dispute about it, therefore, if the intention of the 22 (1969) 1 SCC 597 23 1978 PLD SC 279 24 J.M.A. Raju v Krishnamurthy Bhatt, AIR 1976 Guj 72; Chiranji Lal (Dr.) v.

[HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] Legislature had been to render invalid all instruments not properly A stamped, it would have made express provision in this respect and it would have also provided some machinery for enforcing its mandate in those cases in which the parties did not have occasion to produce unstamped instruments before the persons specified in the section.” B 26. This Court in RIO Glass Solar SA v. Shriram EPC Limited and Ors.25 while holding that foreign awards need not be stamped noted that the Stamp Act, 1899 reflects the fundamental policy of Indian law.
