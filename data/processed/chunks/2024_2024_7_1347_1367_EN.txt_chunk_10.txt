The Act, 1963 provides certain checks and balances which must be fulfilled and established by the plaintiffs before they can become entitled for such a relief. The pleadings in a suit for specific performance have to be very direct, specific and accurate. A suit for specific performance based on bald and vague pleadings must necessarily be rejected. Section 16(C) of the 1963 Act requires readiness and willingness to be pleaded and proved by the plaintiff in a suit for specific performance of contract. The said provision has been widely interpreted and held to be mandatory. A few of authorities on the point are referred hereunder: 16 [2021] 10 SCR 287 : (2021) 17 SCC 705 17 [2023] 3 SCR 802 : (2023) SCC Online SC 442 18 [2010] 4 SCR 515 : (2010) 5 SCC 401 19 [2023] 2 SCR 834 : (2023) 10 SCC 725 20 [2011] 11 SCR 848 : (2012) 1 SCC 656 21 (2013) 1 PLR 195 22 (2022) SCC Online SC 2096 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1363 P. Ravindranath & Anr. v. Sasikala & Ors. a) In the case of Man Kaur v. Hartar Singh Sangha,23 this Court held in paragraph 40 which is reproduced hereunder: “40………A person who fails to aver and prove that he has performed or has always been ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the contract which are to be performed by him (other than the terms the performance of which has been prevented or waived by the defendant) is barred from claiming specific performance. Therefore, even assuming that the defendant had committed breach, if the plaintiff fails to aver in the plaint or prove that he was always ready and willing to perform the essential terms of contract which are required to be performed by him (other than the terms the performance of which has been prevented or waived by the plaintiff), there is a bar to specific performance in his favour. Therefore, the assumption of the respondent that readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff is something which need not be proved, if the plaintiff is able to establish that the defendant refused to execute the sale deed and thereby committed breach, is not correct………….” b) In the case of U.N. Krishnamurthy (Since Deceased) Thr. Lrs. v. A.M. Krishnamurthy,24 following was held in paragraph 46: “46. It is settled law that for relief of specific performance, the Plaintiff has to prove that all along and till the final decision of the suit, he was ready and willing to perform the part of the contract. It is the bounden duty of the Plaintiff to prove his readiness and willingness by adducing evidence. This crucial facet has to be determined by considering all circumstances including 23 [2010] 12 SCR 515 : (2010) 10 SCC 512 24 [2022] 13 SCR 250 : (2022) SCC Online SC 840 1364 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports availability of funds and mere statement or averment in plaint of readiness and willingness, would not suffice.” c) In the case of His Holiness Acharya Swami Ganesh Dassji v. Sita Ram Thapar,25 it was held under paragraph 2: “2.
