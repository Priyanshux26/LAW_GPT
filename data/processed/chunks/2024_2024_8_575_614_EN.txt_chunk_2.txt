Section 376(2)(n) of the IPC, notwithstanding the consensual sexual relationship, the offence punishable under clause (n) of sub- section (2) of Section 376 of the IPC, was made out in the instant case – One of the objectives of the POSCO Act is to effectively address sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children, as both offences are very heinous – In the facts of the case, the accused was not an adolescent, but his age was about twenty-five years on the date of the commission of the offence, and the victim was only fourteen years old – When such offences of rape and aggravated penetrative sexual assault are committed, by exercising its jurisdiction u/Art. 226 of the Constitution of India and/or s.482 of the Cr.PC, the High Court cannot acquit an accused whose guilt has been proved – In the instant case, the High Court was influenced by the fact that the victim’s parents did not support her, and therefore, by sending the accused to jail, she and her child would be miserable as the accused and his family were taking care of them – There are various decisions of this Court holding that the High Court can exercise jurisdiction u/s. 482 of the Cr.PC to quash a prosecution on the grounds of settlement or by consent – However, in respect of serious offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., or other offences of mental depravity under IPC or offences of moral turpitude under special statutes, like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity, the settlement between the offender and the victim can have no legal sanction at all – Therefore, in view of the settled position of law, in the facts of the case, even if the accused and the victim (who has now attained majority) were to come out with a settlement, the High Court could not have quashed the prosecution.
