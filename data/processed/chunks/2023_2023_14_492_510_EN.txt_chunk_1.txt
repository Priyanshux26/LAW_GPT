136 and 137 – Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993. [Para 7, 9, 12, 13,15] Insolvency and Bankruptcy – Insolvency proceedings – Doctrine of election – Application of – Plea of corporate debtor that the banks having approached the DRT, were barred under the doctrine of election from approaching the NCLT for recovery of same set of debts: Held: Doctrine of election embodied in the law of evidence, bars prosecution of the same right in two diff erent fora based on the same cause of action – On facts, the recovery proceedings before the DRT commenced in 2014, and at that point of time, the IBC had not come into existence – Recovery certifi cate itself would give rise to a fresh cause of action entitling a fi nancial creditor to initiate CIRP 494 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. – Such recovery certifi cate arose out of a proceeding from the DRT – Enforcement mechanism for a recovery certifi cate is an independent course, which a fi nancial creditor may opt for realisation of its dues crystalised under the 1993 Act, instead of chasing the mechanism under the 1993 Act – Question of election between the fora for enforcement of debt under the 1993 Act and initiation of CIRP under the IBC arises only after a recovery certifi cate is issued – Reliefs under the two statutes are diff erent and once CIRP results in declaration of moratorium, the enforcement mechanism under the 1993 Act or the SARFAESI Act gets suspended – In such circumstances, after issue of recovery certifi cate, the fi nancial creditor ought to have option for enforcing recovery through a new forum instead of sticking on to the mechanism through which recovery certifi cate was issued – Thus, the doctrine of election cannot be applied to prevent the fi nancial creditors from approaching the NCLT for initiation of CIRP – Doctrines.
