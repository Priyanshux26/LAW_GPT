In that sense, several judicial pronouncements have sought to explain the scope of Article 30 and clarify the extent of the protection granted. B.2. Statutory Scheme 37. Apart from constitutional guarantees and rights, the Indian Parliament has also adopted several legislations to protect the rights of minorities. The National Commission for Minorities was established as a statutory body under the aegis of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992. Section 9(1) of the Act mandates the Commission to perform various functions, including, but not limited to, monitoring the implementation of safeguards for minorities, as provided in the Constitution, and laws enacted by Parliament and State Legislatures. The Commission is also responsible for making recommendations to the Central and State Governments for the effective implementation of these safeguards to protect minority interests. Additionally, it is tasked with addressing specific complaints regarding the deprivation of minority rights and safeguards and addressing such matters with the appropriate authorities. 38. A significant development which flows from Article 30 is also the enactment of the NCMEI Act,which governs minority educational institutions. The NCMEI Act was enacted in 2005 to, inter alia, engender the rights of a minority educational institution to seek recognition as an affiliated college to a Scheduled University and to provide a forum for dispute resolution. In this manner, the NCMEI Act gave greater credence to Article 30 and aided its efficient implementation. 39. In 2006, the NCMEI Act was amended, and the scope of the Commission was expanded further. In addition to protecting the rights of minority educational institutions, the Commission was now endowed with the power to determine and declare whether an institution is a minority institution. Under Section 2(f), minorities have been defined in the NCMEI Act as: “a community notified as such by the Central Government.” Employing this definition, the Central Government has so far notified Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis and Jains as minority communities.52 52 Ministry of Human Resource Development, No. F.7-5/2005-MC(P) (Notified on 18 January, 2005) [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1777 Aligarh Muslim University v.
