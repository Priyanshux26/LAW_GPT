When this matter came for hearing before this Court on 22.04.2024, we had directed the appellants to implead the injured persons as party respondents and thereafter, the impleaded private respondents were asked to file the affidavits regarding their stand on compounding of the offences. We have gone through the affidavits and found that since the appellants are the cousin of respondents no.2 and 3 and have tendered an unconditional apology regarding the incident, these respondents have agreed to compound the offence. A similar stand has been taken by respondent no. 4, who is the uncle of the appellants. 5. As far as Sections 323 and 325 of the IPC are concerned, offences under these provisions are compoundable but the offence under Section 324 of the IPC is a non-compoundable offence. 6. Courts cannot grant permission to compound the non-compoundable offences, on the basis of any sort of compromise between the parties, as it would be contrary to what has been provided by legislation, except the High Court under Section 482 of Cr.PC and the Apex Court in exercise of its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. The compromise between the parties in non-compoundable cases has been taken into consideration by this Court in various occasions to reduce the sentence of the convicts. (See: Murali v. State (2021) 1 SCC 726; Manjit Singh v. State of Punjab & Anr. (2020) 18 SCC 777 ) Also, in a series of other cases, considering that the incident occurred between relatives and the incident is of such a nature which did not have much impact on society, this Court had set aside the conviction by invoking its power under Article 142 of the Constitution in matters involving non-compoundable offences. (See: Kailash Chand v. State of Rajasthan (2021) 18 SCC 534; Srinivasan Iyenger & Anr. v. Bimla Devi Agarwal & Ors. (2019) 4 SCC 456; Ramawatar v. State of M.P (2022) 13 SCC 635 ) 786 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports However, this is to be done only in exceptional cases after considering various factors including the nature of injuries, relation between parties and the impact of crime on society, etc. While discussing the powers of Article 142 of the Constitution and Section 482 CrPC (in relation to High Courts) in quashing criminal proceedings in non- compoundable offences, this Court in Ramgopal & Anr. v. State of M.P (2022) 14 SCC 531 observed as follows: “19. We thus sum up and hold that as opposed to Section 320 CrPC where the Court is squarely guided by the compromise between the parties in respect of offences “compoundable” within the statutory framework, the extraordinary power enjoined upon a High Court under Section 482 CrPC or vested in this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution, can be invoked beyond the metes and bounds of Section 320 CrPC. Nonetheless, we reiterate that such powers of wide amplitude ought to be exercised carefully in the context of quashing criminal proceedings, bearing in mind: 19.1.
