The factum of receipt of cheque amount cannot be disputed by the respondent. In fact, the statement in the counter affidavit of the respondent in this appeal that the appellant’s entitlement is only to get refund of the amount tendered as initial deposit at the time of submitting proposal would reveal the said position. Another circumstance is also relevant in the context of consideration based on the decision in D. Srinivas’s case (supra) viz., the stand of the respondent that mere preparation of the policy document is not acceptance so as to create a concluded contract. The cheque amount was received prior to the death of ‘the deceased’ is not in dispute. Paragraph 5 of the of the District Forum would reveal that the Dhokla Branch of the State Bank of Saurashtra issued certificate that Cheque No.187009 favouring the respondent herein for Rs.3388/- drawn by ‘the deceased’ was paid by him on 12.07.1996. The of the State Commission in paragraph 3 would reveal the consistent stand of the respondent that the proposal form was accepted only on 15.07.1996 whereas the death of ‘the deceased’ was on the previous day viz., on 14.07.1996 and therefore, there was no concluded contract. The documents pertaining to the proposal were perused by 468 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports both the District Forum and the State Commission and the said fact is discernible from their respective s. The various documents were referred to in the s with reference to the page numbers, in which they are available. In the said context, paragraph 6 of the s of the State Commission assumes relevance and the same to the extent it is relevant, read thus:- “6. Page 125 is the proposal form. Perusal of the same suggests that the amount of Rs. 3,388/- is shown as deposit amount and the risk date is shown to be 28.06.1996. Thus, it will be seen that the policy was desired to be effective and risk commenced retrospectively with effect from 28.06.1996. It is also suggested that the said proposal form was filled in on 09.07.1996. Page 126 reads the same to be suspense memorandum with BOC No. 600392 dated 09 .07 .1996 and the policy of proposal number is shown as F.P. Page 130 reads that next premium would become due on 28.12.1996…….” 24. In the circumstances, referred to in the s of the District Forum and the State Commission as also noted hereinbefore, the question is whether a clear presumption as to the acceptance of the policy by the insurer is available in the case on hand. In Annexure B receipt of the first premium, it is specifically stated that the acceptance of payment would place the Corporation on risk with effect from the date of the said Acceptance-cum-First Premium Receipt, subject to the realization of the amount in cash and the terms and conditions of acceptance printed overleaf. What is printed overleaf is not on record as the same was not produced, though it should be a part of Annexure B.
