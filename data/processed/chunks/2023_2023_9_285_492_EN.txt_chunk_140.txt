That is to say, that an arbitration agreement cannot be rendered “void” on insufficient stamping by a Section 11 judge when the scope of G 63Anandji Haridas and Co. (P) Ltd. v. S.P.

Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Sheth [(1984) 4 SCC 27] H 474 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A examination is only limited to the “existence” of the arbitration agreement and not “validity”. 79.3. Coming back to the evidentiary bar under Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899 it is important to understand that since the scope of a Section 11 judge is limited, the court cannot receive evidence in such B cases. Before the 2015 Amendment to the Arbitration Act, 1996, as per the position laid down in SBP(supra), the Chief Justice had wide powers to receive evidence, including affidavits, and get evidence recorded at the stage of appointment of arbitrator. Under the amended Section 11, as noted before, the scope is “confined” to the examination of the “existence” of the arbitration agreement. Thus, post-amendment, C it can most certainly not admit evidence. A Section 11 Court is “not an authority to receive evidence” as provided in Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899. Moreover, it is an undisputed position that Section 35 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 does not preclude an arbitrator to impound or admit evidence. It states “any person having by law or consent of parties, D authority to receive evidence.” Thus, the statutory bar under Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899 would not apply when a document is produced at the stage of a Section 11 proceeding of the Arbitration Act, 1996. 79.4. It is essential to interpret the special law in a way that gives effect to its specific provisions, while also ensuring that it is consistent E with the general law to the extent possible. Impounding at the stage of Section 11 would stall arbitral proceedings right at the outset because of the statutory bar under Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899. One way to harmonise Section 35 of Stamp Act, 1899 and Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 is for the Section 11 judge to defer necessary stamping and impounding to the arbitrator/collector, as applicable. A plain F reading of Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899 makes it clear that it does not preclude an Arbitrator or Collector to impound the unstamped/ insufficiently stamped document. 79.5. In this context, even if we are to assume that the Stamp Act, 1899 is a substantive law, the view taken by us is not intended to G undermine the Stamp Act, 1899 in any substantial way.
