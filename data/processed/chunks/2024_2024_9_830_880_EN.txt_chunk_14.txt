Section 126(1)(b) of MRTP Act provides for compulsory acquisition, wherein compensation is provided in the form of FSI or TDR in two parts: (i) for the land; and (ii) for development/construction of the amenity at the cost of the owner on the surrendered land in terms of the DCR. That Regulations 33(1) and 34 prior to their amendment in the year 2010 provided a mechanism for grant of TDR for both the first as well as the second component. This Court had interpreted the aforesaid provisions in the case of Godrej & Boyce I. This Court observed that the grant of additional TDR was for construction or development of the amenity. However, in the year 2010, there was an amendment which stated that in addition to the land component of FSI/TDR, the land owner would be entitled to receive only additional 25% FSI/TDR for construction of road. However, the additional 25% could be used as FSI on the remainder of the plot if the remainder of the plot could consume to the extent of 40/80% of the remaining land after surrender. The balance FSI/TDR was eligible to be paid as TDR under Paras 5 and 6 of Appendix-VII-A and Regulation 34 of the DCR.
