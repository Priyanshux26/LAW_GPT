Therefore, in the ultimate analysis, we are clearly of the view that there had been no justification for making any attempt to re-classify the product in question with reference to the amendments brought about in Chapters 30 and 33 in the year 2012. Conclusion F 34. For what has been discussed hereinabove, answers to the points arising for determination are that the product in question, AHAHO, merits classification as ‘medicament’ under Chapter 30 and not as ‘cosmetic or toilet preparations’ under Chapter 33 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985; and the change in tariff structure G by way of amendment brought about in the year 2012 did not justify any re-look at the classification of the product in question. 35. In view of the above, this appeal fails and is, therefore, dismissed. No costs. H Nidhi Jain Appeal dismissed.
