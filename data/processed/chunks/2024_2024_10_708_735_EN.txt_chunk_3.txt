The Trial Court answered issue Nos.2 & 8 to 10 in the negative and issue Nos.6 & 7 in the affirmative. Furthermore, it was held that the evidence on record would reveal that prior to the year 1952, the father of the first respondent-plaintiff and father of original defendants were carrying on business in Bangles jointly and Bangle shops were opened in Raipur in the year 1952, and thereafter, in Dhamtari in the year 1973 as joint business. Joint business would create strong presumption of joint family. The Trial Court also held that the age of the aforesaid Sitaram, the vendor who was the common cousin of the plaintiff and the original defendants, was shown in Ext.P1/C – sale deed dated 04.06.1968, as 22 years and hence, at the time of purchase of the said suit schedule property, Sitaram must have been aged only 17 years.
