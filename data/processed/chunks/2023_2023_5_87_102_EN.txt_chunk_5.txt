It is a submitted that respondents were well aware that a direction was passed by the High Court of Delhi in its dated 20.07.2017 that the re-evaluation would be confined to the grievance articulated by 13 candidates. It is submitted that the re-evaluation was closed vide G dated 30.08.2017, the respondents consciously opted to not initiate any action either to challenge the s or to seek re-evaluation, despite having knowledge as the said exercise being undertaken and the results thereof were furnished to them on 12.09.2017. It is submitted that 5 out of initially selected 27 candidates were prompt in seeking re-evaluation, unlike the remaining 22 already selected candidates. H 94 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 3.3 It is submitted that furthermore, in the case of Saphalta Bhati (supra) the High Court denied the re-evaluation on the grounds of delay and laches which attained the finality. It is submitted that respondents were fence sitters and it is well settled law that while exercising public law jurisdiction, the courts should not encourage stale claims especially when rights of third parties have been crystalized in the interregnum. B 3.4 It is further submitted that the High Court in paragraph 68 of the impugned has expressly upheld the appointment of the appellants from 30.01.2017 which was not challenged by the respondents herein. It is submitted that therefore, the contention of the respondents that the appointment ought to have been w.e.f. 12.03.2018 is erroneous. It is C submitted that once the appellants were appointed w.e.f. 30.01.2017 they ought to have been given the benefit of their revised marks as mere appointment from 30.01.2017 confers no benefit on the appellants. 3.5 It is submitted that being a selection based on merit, the rank in the merit list would determine the seniority of the candidates and D merely granting notional seniority w.e.f. 30.01.2017 has no bearing. The length of service is immaterial as it was on the basis of position earned in the merit list that a candidate becomes entitled to future appointment. 3.6 It is submitted that notional seniority is to grant the benefit of seniority without any back wages, arrears and other benefits as ought to E have been done in the present case. It is submitted that appellants, though no fault of their own, as a result of wrong marking were deprived of their position in select list dated 30.01.2017 and on the correction of the marking ought to have been given the benefit of notional seniority i.e., inter se seniority on the basis of merit. F 3.7 It is further submitted that the whole foundation of the exam was to draw out a merit list on the basis of marks obtained. Exercise of re-evaluation was carried out for a total 13 candidates, of which 5 candidates were already in the select list notified on 30.01.2017. 3.8 It is submitted that carrying out theexercise of re-evaluation G of 13 candidates which included candidates who were already selected to the posts of private secretaries could have been done only with the intention of giving the benefit of rank based on merits.
