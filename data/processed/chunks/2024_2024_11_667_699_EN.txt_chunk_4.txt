[…] 23. The parties of the second part herein undertake on any pretext they will not make any claim for enhancing the agreed sale consideration.” (emphasis supplied) 4. The first agreement to sell refers to the “original owners” as the “parties of the first part”. The agreement refers to the “vendors” as the “parties to the second part”. The petitioner is referred to as the “purchaser”. It must also be noted that the recital to the first sale agreement states that the “parties of the first part and parties 1,3,5 and 6 of the parties of the second part” have been made a party to the agreement only to ensure that there is no “cloud over the title”. 5. On 27 March 1997, an agreement to sell was executed by the first and second respondents in favour of the petitioner to sell the scheduled property of 1.33 Acs2 for a consideration of Rs. 1,82,500. This agreement will be referred to as the second agreement to sell. 6. On 8 February 2000, the petitioner issued a legal notice (“first legal notice”) to the first and second respondents calling upon them to 2 “All that the agricultural land bearing Sy. Nos. 304 part totally admeasuring Ac. 1.33 guntas situated at Budwel village, the then Hyderabad West Tq. Now Rajendernagar mandal, R.R. District, which is bounded by as under:- East: Sy. No. 308 West: Sy. No. 3030 North: Sy. No. 326 South: Sy. No. 305”. 674 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports receive the balance sale consideration and execute the sale deed. On 14 April 2000, the second respondent responded to the legal notice claiming to not have received the part-payment and refusing to execute a sale deed in the petitioner’s favour. On 6 July 2002, the petitioner issued another legal notice (“second legal notice”) to all the respondents calling upon them to execute the sale deed upon the receipt of the balance consideration. The first and second respondents replied to the legal notice by a letter dated 22 July 2002 claiming that (a) the execution is barred by limitation; (b) they were ready with the documents required under Clause 3 of the first agreement to sell but the petitioner was not willing to pay the balance consideration; and (c) the first legal notice dated 8 February 2000 was ante-dated to overcome limitation. The first legal notice was posted on 30 March 2000 by registered post. 7. On 9 August 2002, the petitioner instituted a suit seeking a decree for specific performance of the first and the second agreements to sell. The case of the petitioner in the suit was: a. Rs.34,70,000 towards the sale consideration for the first agreement and Rs. 10,850 as advance for the second agreement was paid. Thus, of the aggregate sale consideration of Rs. 40,20,000, Rs., 34,80,850 was paid and only a balance of Rs. 5,39,150 remained outstanding; b. The possession of the suit land was delivered under the agreement; and c. The petitioner has always been ready and willing to perform his part of the agreements.
