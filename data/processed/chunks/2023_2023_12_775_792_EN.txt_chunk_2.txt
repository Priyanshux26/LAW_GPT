It was further stipulated that upon completion of ten years or on completion of the project, the lease would convert to a sale, subject to fulfi lment of all the terms & conditions of allotment and payment of price of land in full as may be fi nally determined by the appellant. It was also clearly mentioned in the allotment letter that the price of land indicated was only tentative (Rs. 1 Crore per acre). The fi nal price of the allotted land would be communicated later, which would be dependent upon other factors being fi nalized in the meantime. Possession of the land was given to the respondent on 09.05.2006. 5. A lease cum sale agreement was executed between the appellant and the respondent on 30.10.2006. The terms of the lease cum sale agreement would be dealt in detail at a later stage. 6. The respondent, which was originally a partnership fi rm, applied for it being converted into a private limited company in 2007. The appellant issued no objection certifi cate in that regard on 18.05.2007. 7. In the 141st Board meeting of the appellant dated 19.07.2007, the Board resolved that the price for allotment would be as per the guidance value fi xed by the Government, which was Rs. 800/- per sq. ft. It would work out to Rs. 3.2 Crores per acre. The said value was duly adopted based upon the guidance value determined by the Government. 8. On 23.07.2007, the respondent applied to the appellant for conversion of nature of use from Information Technology sector to Hospitality sector. As per the terms of allotment and the lease agreement, change in nature of use could be granted, subject to the payment of additional charges at the prevailing rate. On 24.09.2007, communication was issued by the appellant granting permission for the change in the nature of activity, subject to payment of Rs. 20 lacs per acre. The respondent thereafter paid an amount of Rs. 5 lacs as the allotted land was only one quarter of an acre. On 15.10.2007, the respondent also applied for approval of its plan for construction. 9. On 06.11.2008, an audit objection was raised stating that the prevailing rate of plot at the time of change of use was Rs. 3.2 Crores per KARNATAKA STATE ELECTRONICS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION 779 LTD. v. KUMAON ENTERTAINMENT AND HOSPITALITIES PVT. LTD. [VIKRAM NATH, J.] acre, whereas permission of change of use was granted at a much lower rate. The appellant had, therefore, suff ered a loss of Rs. 46.25 lacs. Further, as the rate of Rs. 3.2 Crores per acre was applicable for residential purposes, but this being used for commercial purpose, the rate would be higher by 40 per cent and, therefore, the loss would be additional Rs. 32 lacs. 10. On 31.10.2011, the respondent requested the appellant for execution of the sale deed. Thereafter he also gave a show cause notice on 05.06.2012 for execution of the sale deed. The appellant sent a reply in response to the notice on 25.07.2012, calling upon the respondent to pay Rs.
