In view of the aforesaid Rules, it can be B inferred that any Indian citizen who entered Sikkim for the purpose of employment prior to 26th April, 1975 was treated on par with Sikkimese and not as a foreigner. It is plausible that because of the concession given under Work Permit Rules of 1965, Indian citizens or nationals did not get themselves registered under the Register of Sikkim Subjects C at the relevant point of time. 68.9. It is contended that only a small percentage of settlers of Indian origin in Sikkim have not been registered under the Register of Sikkim Subjects and as a result they are not provided the benefit of exemption under the Explanation to D clause (26AAA) of Section 10 of the I.T. Act, 1961. In the circumstances, the respondent-Union of India must consider ways and means in which such persons could also receive the benefit of exemption from payment of income tax if they were domiciled in Sikkim on or before 26th April, 1975 E by amending the Explanation to Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 or by issuing a circular enabling such individuals being given the opportunity to register themselves in the said Register. 68.10.Further, the Government of India has enabled the registration F of all such persons who were omitted from the Register of Sikkim Subjects under the 1961 Regulation read with the 1961 Rules. The Government of India dated 7th August, 1990 also has a deeming fiction inasmuch as all subjects registered under the Register of Sikkim Subjects have become citizens of India as on 26th April, 1975. G 68.11. The rationale for extending the registration of persons who were omitted from the Register of Sikkim Subjects under the 1961 Regulation vide Government of India s dated 07th August, 1990 and 08th April, 1991 is in recognition of the fact that individuals who were domiciled in Sikkim, for H 360 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A various reasons could not be registered under the Register of Sikkim Subjects. If the criterion of domicile has been the basis for registration of persons in the Register under the 1961 Regulations, then by the very same basis, individuals such as the petitioners and all similarly situated persons domiciled in Sikkim on or before 26th April, 1975 which is B the day on which Sikkim merged with India must be given the benefit of the exemption even if their names are presently not registered in the Register of Sikkim Subjects in to remove the vice of discrimination vis-a-vis such individuals. 68.12. Hence, persons such as the petitioners and other similarly C situated persons who have not been registered under the Register of Sikkim Subjects can now seek registration in view of the aforesaid discussion as registration under the said Register is the basis for extending the exemption under Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961. Hence, directions D have been issued so as to include persons such as the petitioners and other similarly situated persons.
