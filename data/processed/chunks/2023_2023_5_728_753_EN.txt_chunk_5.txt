This Application was ‘allowed’ or ‘admitted’ on24.05.2014, a point of controversy to be noticed and dealt with. The surety was one C Abhishek Dixit (the 7th proforma respondent in this appeal). This was the Application numbered as 14C. On 23.09.2015, the Trial Court dismissed Application 8C filed under Section 17 of the Act. The , inter alia, states as follows: “In the light of above contentions/ arguments, I carefully inspected D record file and found that the Restoration Application i.e. 08C was presented itself on 06.05.2014, but this application was not corroborated before the then Presiding Officer, but after submitting the application i.e. 8C, it has been submitted the application i.e. 14C before Court, which was admitted by Court on 24.05.2015, E but it was not deposited necessary compensation with the same. Therefore, it was not remained any relevance to again pass the on application i.e., 08C after submitting the application i.e., 14C. In the above circumstances, the application i.e. 08C has been fruitless as the application i.e. 14C has already been admitted on 24.05.2014 by the then Presiding Officer. Therefore, at this F stage, it is not any relevance of application i.e., 08C and the same is liable to be dismissed.” (Emphasis supplied) 6.
