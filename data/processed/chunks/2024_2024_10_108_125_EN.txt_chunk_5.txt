Further, the Court held that the testimonies of PW2, PW4 and PW18 were consistent regarding the participation of A-6 and A-7 and thus, they were convicted for the commission of the offences under Sections 364 and 302 of IPC read with Section 34 of IPC. The applicability of Section 34 IPC was based on the fact that A-6 and A-7 had confined PW18 near the well in to eliminate any chances of resistance in the acts committed by the other five accused persons. SUBMISSIONS 12. On behalf of A-6 and A-7, it is submitted that there was no motive for the said accused persons to have indulged in the commission of the offence in question. The motive, if any, existed only for the remaining five accused persons who were interested in the outcome of the pending litigation between the parties. It is further contended that the High Court ought not to have entered into the exercise of re-appreciation of the entire evidence without finding any infirmity in the view taken by the Trial Court. To buttress this submission, it is submitted that since the view taken by the Trial Court was a possible view, it could not have been disturbed by the High Court in appeal. In this regard, reliance has been placed upon the decisions of this Court in State of Goa v. Sanjay Thakran,5 Chandrappa v. State of Karnataka,6 Nepal Singh v. State of Haryana,7 Kashiram v. State of M.P.,8 Labh Singh v. State of Punjab9 and Suratlal v. State of M.P.10 13. It is further submitted that no reliance could be placed upon the testimonies of PW2 and PW4 as their presence at the spot was doubtful. Further, if they were 400 yards away when hue and cry was raised, they could not have seen A-6 taking away PW18 towards the well as the said fact took place prior to the hue and cry. It is further 5 [2007] 3 SCR 507 : (2007) 3 SCC 755 6 [2007] 2 SCR 630 : (2007) 4 SCC 415 7 [2009] 6 SCR 982 : (2009) 12 SCC 351 8 [2001] 4 Supp. SCR 263 : (2002) 1 SCC 71 9 (1976) 1 SCC 181 10 (1982) 1 SCC 488 116 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports submitted that in the FIR, no pistol was assigned to A-6, whereas, the said fact was brought forward at the time of evidence. The appellants have also raised a question regarding the time of incident on the basis of medical evidence. It is stated that the post-mortem report indicated that half-digested food was found in the stomach of the deceased, whereas, the informant PW18 deposed that the incident took place immediately after dinner. If such was the case, the death ought to have occurred around 1-2 AM in the intervening night of 30.08.1985-31.08.1985, but the post-mortem report, based on the post-mortem conducted at around 05:30 PM on 31.08.1985, indicated that death took place about 24 hours ago and thus, the time of death was around 05:00 PM on 30.08.1985 and not 10:00 PM, as alleged.
