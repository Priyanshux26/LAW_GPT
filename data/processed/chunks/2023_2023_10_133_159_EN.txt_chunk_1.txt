The EPCA report clearly states that the total capacity was 1.17 million tonnes; in arriving at this figure the EPCA took note D of the capacity based upon the Consent to Operate (CTO) issued by the concerned Pollution Control Board. In the case of Rain CII, the capacity recorded was 500,000 MTPA, and in the case of Sanvira 2,00,000 MTPA. The guidelines for regulation and monitoring of imported pet coke had been issued on 10th E September 2018 by an office memorandum – through the MOEF, GOI. [Paras 18 and 20][149-E-G; 150-D-E] 1.2 The consent issued by the concerned SPCB or the PCC had to clearly state what was the capacity or quantity permitted for import by the concerned unit. In the present case, it is not F disputed that the Consent to Operate (CTO) issued by APPCB in Sanvira’s favor recorded the total capacity at 2,00,000 TPA. If one sees the disputes in terms of these facts, what is clear is that the CTO mentions Sanvira’s capacity at 2,00,000 TPA. Sanvira’s position is that the CTO for an additional 1,30,000 TPA was granted on 29.11.2018 and that the application for such capacity G was made on 29.10.2018. [Paras 21 and 22][151-D, F-G] 1.3 The APPCB issued the CTO for the quantity of 3,30,000 TPA only for 23.12.2019, the concerned APPCB/VSP/VSP/ 305/HO/CFO/2019. The consistent position of the GOI is that H M/S. SANVIRA INDUSTRIES v. RAIN CII CARBON (VIZAG) 135 LTD. & ORS. any capacity added by the procedures after the of this Court A dated 09.10.2018 would not be taken into consideration while allocating the RPC. The minutes also recorded that Sanvira’s additional capacity was created after this court’s dated 09.10.2018. From all these facts, it is evident that Sanvira kept on contending that its capacity was 3,30,000 MTPA. The minutes B of the meeting dated 13.02.2020, also allude to the previous attempts by Sanvira, to have its capacity increased, as on 09.10.2018 in an effort to secure more allocation. All such contentions were rejected. In this background, the view expressed by the single judge, that the principle for allocation was changed somewhat in the public notice, dated 17.04.2020, is C not tenable. Interestingly, even as on that day, i.e. 17.04.2020, there was no confirmation by the APPCB that Sanvira’s unit had the capacity it claimed (3,30,000 MT annually). The CTO for that capacity had been issued only on 26.12.2019. As on that day, there was nothing to show that the earlier CTO stood amended with D effect from the date it was issued (i.e. 24.02.2017), or any date prior to 09.10.2018. In such background, Sanvira wrote to APPCB, on 21.04.2020 seeking a “clarification”. APPCB replied with refreshing alacrity on 04.05.2020. This letter virtually became the gateway for a review of the entire system of allocation. Clearly, the GOI had altered its position, within five weeks, because in E the dated 02.05.2020, in an application moved by Sanvira, in the pending writ petition, its position, through the statement of its counsel, was that there was no change in the allocation method, by the public notice of 17.04.2020.
