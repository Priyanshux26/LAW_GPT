(Concurring)] – s.114 has nothing to do with, nor is in connection with conclusive proof of legitimacy dealt with by s.112 – Both s.112 and s.114 fall under different compartments – s.114(h) has no application to a case where a mother refuses to make the child G undergo DNA test – Furthermore, on facts, respondent had access to the wife both at the time when the child was begotten and for a full period of three years even thereafter – Therefore, the conclusive proof u/s.112 has actually come into play in this case – Contention of the respondent that what is sought to be invoked is only s.114(h) and not s.112 is rejected. H 682 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A Evidence Act, 1872 – s.112 – Question of legitimacy of the child, burden of proof – Held: Since s.112 creates a presumption of legitimacy that a child born during the subsistence of a marriage is deemed to be legitimate, a burden is cast on the person who questions the legitimacy of the child. B Evidence Act, 1872 – s.112 – Principle underlying – “access”, “non-access” – Meaning – Held: Principle underlying s.112 is to prevent an unwarranted enquiry as to the paternity of the child whose parents, at the relevant time had “access” to each other – “access” or “non-access” does not mean actual co-habitation but means the “existence” or “non-existence” of opportunities for sexual C relationship – s.112 refers to point of time of birth as the crucial aspect and not to the time of conception – The time of conception is relevant only to see whether the husband had or did not have access to the wife – Operation of the conclusive presumption can be avoided by proving non-access at the relevant time. D International Law – International Conventions/Treaties– The Convention on Rights of Child – Best interests of a child – Rights to Privacy, Autonomy and Identity of Children – Discussed. Evidence Act, 1872 – s.112 – Object of – Held: A child should not be lost in its search for paternity – Precious childhood and E youth cannot be lost in a quest to know about one’s paternity – Therefore, the wholesome object of Section 112 of the Evidence Act which confers legitimacy on children born during the subsistence of a valid marriage, subject to the same being rebutted by cogent and strong evidence, is to be preserved – A finding as to illegitimacy, if revealed in a DNA test, effect on the child psychologically, F discussed. Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.4, 112 – Held: A combined reading of ss.4 and 112 would show that once the party questioning the legitimacy of the birth of a child shows that the parties to the marriage had no access to each other, then the benefit of s.112 is not available G to the party invoking s.112 – However, if such a party is not able to prove that he had no access to the other party to the marriage, then the shield of s.112 protects the other party to such an extent that it cannot be pierced by any amount of evidence in view of the prohibition contained in s.4.
