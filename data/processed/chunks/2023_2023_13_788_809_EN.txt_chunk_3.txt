CW1/A) was admitted by the accused and, hence, it rightly raised the statutory presumption under Section 139 NI Act. It, then, rightly noted that the onus of rebutting the presumption lay on the accused and said onus was to be discharged by raising a ‘probable defence’ which would create a doubt as to the existence of a legally enforceable debt. 13. It then framed the point for determination as follows: “The only question remaining for determination is whether a legally valid and enforceable debt existed qua the complainant and the cheque in question (Ex. CWI/A) was issued in discharge of said liability/debt?” 14. The Trial Court answered the issue in the negative. It held that the complainant had failed to prove his case beyond reasonable doubt.

CW2/2-Copy of Cheque Bonus Register RAJESH JAIN v. AJAY SINGH 793 [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] has been observed that the defence led by the accused has created a doubt regarding the truthfulness of the complainant’s case. 15. The conclusion of the Trial Court was based on the following grounds: (i) That the legal notice [Ex. CW1/D] dated 26.10.2017 was not a valid legal notice since it was not signed by the complainant or his counsel. (ii) In the complaint, legal notice as well as the affi davit evidence, the complainant has failed to mention the date, month and year on which he advanced various sums of money towards loan. (iii) The evidence on records indicates that the complainant is in the business of money lending. Since he does not possess any valid license/ registration4 under the Punjab Registration of Money Lenders Act, 19385 (Money Lenders Act), he could not have fi led a suit for recovery of money advanced as per Section 3 of the Money Lenders Act. The Bombay High Court has in the case of Nanda v. Nandakishor6 interpreted the phrase ‘in any suit’ as found in Section 3, widely, to include even a complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act. Relying on the said decision, the Trial Court has concluded that the complaint has been fi led in respect of an unenforceable claim. (iv) The procedure set out in Section 138 has not been properly followed in that the legal notice has been issued prematurely, even before the complainant had received notice of the cheque return memo. The date refl ected on the cheque return memo is 1.11.2017 and the date on which the legal notice was issued is 26.10.17. The legal notice could not have been issued until the cheque had been dishonoured. (v) The version of the complainant is doubtful since the cheque was, admittedly, issued in part-payment of outstanding dues. Nowhere in the complaint or demand notice has the complainant disclosed the total amount loaned to the accused. The Court found it rather surprising 4 Section 4(2) postulates no money-lender shall carry on the business of advancing loans unless he gets himself registered under sub-section (1) 5 Adaptation of Law 1968 – See Page 75 6 (2010) SCC OnLine Bombay 54 794 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R.
