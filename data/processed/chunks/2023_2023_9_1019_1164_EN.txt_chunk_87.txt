Regulations, the wisdom, necessity, and validity of which, as applied to existing conditions, are so apparent that they are now uniformly sustained, a century ago, or even half a century ago, probably would have been rejected as arbitrary and oppressive. Such regulations are G sustained, under the complex conditions of our day, for reasons analogous to those which justify traffic regulations, which, before the advent of automobiles and rapid transit street railways, would have been condemned as fatally arbitrary and unreasonable.” 64 272 US 365 (1926) H ASSOCIATION OF VASANTH APARTMENTS’ OWNERS v. 1137 V. GOPINATH & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] 132. In the recent relating to land use in the United A States reported in Coy A. Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District65, the Court, speaking through the majority (5:4), had the following facts before it. The petitioner therein decided to develop a 3.7 acre section of his property and he applied for certain permits required in this regard. To mitigate the environmental effects of his proposal, the B petitioner offered to foreclose any possible future development of the approximately 11 acres southern section of his land by deeding to the district a conservation easement on that portion of his property. The District, however wanted the petitioner to reduce the size of development to 1 acre and deed the conservation easement to the remaining extent of 13.9 acres. The District wanted the petitioner to make improvement to C District owned wet lands, several miles away. The District hinted all that it would consider alternative wherein monetary equivalent was proposed. It is in these facts that the majority view was inter alia as follows: - “II A [1,2] We have said in a variety of contexts that “the D government may not deny a benefit to a person because he exercises a constitutional right.” Regan v. Taxation WithRepresentation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 545, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983). See also, e.g., Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 59–60, E 126 S.Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006); Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 78, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990).” xxxx xxxx xxxx “A second reality of the permitting process is that many proposed F land uses threaten to impose costs on the public that dedications of property can offset. Where a building proposal would substantially increase traffic congestion, for example, officials might condition permit approval on the owner’s agreement to deed over the land needed to widen a public road.” G xxxx xxxx xxxx “(3) …Under Nollan and Dolan the government may choose whether and how a permit applicant is required to mitigate the impacts of a proposed development, but it may not leverage its 65 133 S.Ct. 2586 (2013) H 1138 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A legitimate interest in mitigation to pursue governmental ends that lack an essential nexus and rough proportionality to those impacts.” xxxx xxxx xxxx “(7) …Extortionate demands for property in the land-use permitting context run afoul of the Takings Clause not because they take B property but because they impermissibly burden the right not to have property taken without just compensation.
