24. We heard the present appeal in detail and have also taken a view in the matter, but having realised that there are a large number of decisions which are not only inconsistent with one another on principle but have tried to negotiate a contrary view by distinguishing them on facts or by simply ignoring the binding decision, we are of the view that there must be clarity and certainty in the interpretation of Section 14 of the Act. 25. In view of the above, we direct the Registry to place our along with the appeal paper book before the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India for constituting an appropriate larger bench for reconciling [2024] 12 S.C.R. 519 Tej Bhan (D) Through Lr. & Ors. v. Ram Kishan (D) Through Lrs. & Ors. the principles laid down in various s of this Court and for restating the law on the interplay between sub-section (1) and (2) of Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act. Result of the case: Matter referred to Chief Justice for constituting appropriate Bench. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
