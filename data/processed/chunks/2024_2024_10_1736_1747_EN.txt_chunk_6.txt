14. As a riposte, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the decisions relied on the side of the State are not applicable to the facts of the present case, wherein the case was not contested on merits and based on the statement made by the State in the writ proceedings, the learned Single Judge passed the s dated 30.11.2016 relating to grant of interest on the delayed payment. It is also submitted that on behalf of the State, one Assistant by name Preet Singh was present in the Court and after obtaining instructions from him, the State counsel made the statement before the learned Single Judge that the Government shall pay interest on the delayed payment. Therefore, the learned counsel prayed to this Court that the State may be directed to grant interest at the rate of 9% from 01.01.2006 or at least from the date on which the Government approved the grant of revised pension to the retired teachers of the Government Aided Private Colleges. 15. We have considered the submissions made by the learned senior counsel and learned AAG appearing for the parties and perused the materials on record. 16. Concededly, the appellants were paid the arrears of revised pension w.e.f. 01.01.2006, on par with the employees / Lecturers of the Government Colleges, during 2017-2018. Claiming interest on such payment, which was originally granted by the learned Single Judge and was subsequently, denied by the High Court, the appellants are before us. 17. As we have already stated, in terms of the dated 25.07.2012, which attained finality on 10.07.2014, the retired employees / Lecturers of the Government Colleges were given revised pension with effect from 01.01.2006, on 07.11.2014. However, they were not granted any interest for the payment of arrears of pension due to them. Having compared with them, the appellants sought revised pension, by filing CWP No.8988 of 2015 and connected cases. 9 Periyar & Pareekannai Rubber Ltd v. State of Kerala (1991) 4 SCC 195 1746 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports During the writ proceedings, the State accepted the claim of the appellants and paid the arrears of revised pension with effect from 01.01.2006. Therefore, since the appellants were claiming parity with the employees / Lecturers of the Government colleges, they should not be entitled to any payment of interest. 18. Apparently, the entire case of the appellants rests on the factum recorded by the learned Single Judge in his s dated 30.11.2016 to the effect that the Assistant, Preet Singh gave oral instructions to the State counsel that interest will be given by the Government on delayed payment of revised pension. However, it is interesting to note that there was no written instruction furnished by the State; the appellants did not argue the matter on merits; and the learned Single Judge passed the s dated 30.11.2016, only on the concessions made on behalf of the State. In such circumstances, the claim of the appellants seeking interest, has no legs to stand.
