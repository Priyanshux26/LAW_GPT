726 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. vii. The arbitration agreement may also be in writing if it is contained in the record of the agreement comprising exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication including communication through electronic means (Section 7(4)(b)). In these instances, parties to the agreement as well as the existence of the arbitration agreement is a matter of interpretation and construction by the referral court or arbitral tribunal. The inquiry under Section 7(4)(b) is to determine whether there exists an agreement for referring the matter to arbitration, and who are the parties to such an agreement. viii. The referral court or the arbitral tribunal, while considering the claim of a non-signatory for reference, or the objection of a non- signatory to the inclusion in an arbitration, will primarily examine the record of agreement under Section 7(4)(b) and consider the express language employed by the parties. ix. Once the express terms are ascertained,31 their meaning is a matter of construction by the court or arbitral tribunal. The object of such construction is to discover the intention of the parties.32 Intention must always be ascertained through the words actually used, for there is no intention independent of the language employed by the parties. x. For the purpose of ascertaining the true meaning of the express words, the court or tribunal may also look into the surrounding circumstances such as the nature and object of the contract,33 and conduct of the parties during the formation, implementation, and discharge of the contract.34 Trade practices also assume importance 31 Rickmers Verwaltung Gmbh (supra), para 13; MTNL v.

LTD. & ANR. 727 [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J.] in determining the meaning of the language employed by the parties.35 While interpreting the contract, courts or tribunals adopt well-established principles of construction. These principles are in the nature of guidelines for the court to presume the intention of the parties. xi. As the arbitration agreement is confi ned to a written document contained in the material specifi ed in Section 7(4)(b) and the interpretation and construction is based on its text, Sections 91 and 92 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 disable adducing of oral evidence.36 This is necessary to prevent a referral proceeding from being converted into a full-fl edged trial. If the arbitration agreement cannot be deduced from the record of agreement as provided in Section 7(4)(b), the inquiry must conclude.
