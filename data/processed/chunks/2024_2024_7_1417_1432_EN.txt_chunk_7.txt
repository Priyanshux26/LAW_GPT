Defendant Nos.4 & 5 are stated to be in control of the first and second floor of the property which are under the tenancy of different tenants. They do not have any grievance against the direction issued by the Trial Court regarding rendition of accounts of the rent collected by them. In fact, they have already rendered the accounts. 16. The effect of the of the High Court is that the co-sharers in the property to the extent of 16% are not liable to render accounts. 17. Firstly, we deal with the issue regarding rendering of accounts by the defendant No.3(a), who had stepped into the shoes of defendant No.3 as he had purchased his share during the pendency of this suit. It is not in dispute that the defendant No.3 was owing only 1% of the share in the property in question, whereas he had possession of a substantial part thereof and handed over the possession of the same to the defendant No.3(a). 11 [2023] 1 SCR 601 : (2023) 8 SCC 643 : 2023 INSC 22 1428 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
