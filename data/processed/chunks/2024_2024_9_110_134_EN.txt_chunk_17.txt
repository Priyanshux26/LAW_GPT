It is also not disputed that the Appellant No. 1 being a Member of Parliament has also an official residence at Delhi. 21. In that view of the matter, we do not find any substance in the challenge made by the Appellants to the Summons issued to the Appellants under Section 50 of the PMLA. As contemplated in the sub-section (3) of Section 50, all the persons summoned are bound to attend in person or through authorized agents as the officer may direct and are bound to state the truth upon any subject respecting which they are examined or make statements, and to produce the documents as may be required. As per sub-section (4) thereof 134 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports every proceeding under sub-sections (2) and (3) is deemed to be a Judicial proceeding within the meaning of Section 193 and Section 228 of the IPC. As per sub-section (4) of Section 63, a person who intentionally disobeys any direction issued under Section 50 is liable to be proceeded against under Section 174 of the IPC. 22. As transpiring from the Status Report submitted by the Deputy Director, Directorate of Enforcement, New Delhi, pursuant to the passed by this Court on 18.07.2024, the Appellant No. 2 – Rujira Banerjee had not appeared and not produced the documents as required vide the Summons dated 04.08.2021 and 18.08.2021. The ED therefore had filed the Complaint in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi against her under Section 63 PMLA r/w Section 174 IPC. It is also pertinent to note that though the Appellant No. 2 by filing the Crl. M.C. No. 2442 of 2021 before the High Court had challenged the dated 18.09.2021 passed by the said Court taking cognizance of the said Complaint and the dated 30.09.2021 summoning her before the Court, she has not even bothered to produce the said s before this Court in the instant Appeals. Since the said Complaint is pending before the concerned Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, we do not express any opinion on the merits of the said Complaint. Suffice it to say that we do not find any illegality in the said s passed by the concerned court and that the said complaint shall be proceeded further by the said Court in accordance with law. 23. For the reasons stated above, both the Appeals being devoid of merits are dismissed. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
