As held in Ram Kesh Yadav (supra), the employer had an option to inform the employee that compassionate appointment could not be given in view of the existing norms, and that it would consider the employee’s request for retirement on medical grounds by delinking the request of voluntary retirement from the request of compassionate appointment. As per above discussion, this was not done in this case. In view of the foregoing legal position, vide dated 10.10.2023 referred above, we requested the Board to decide the claim of the appellant afresh. But again, it was rejected without considering the ratio of the of Ram Kesh Yadav (supra) which, in our view, is without application of mind and contrary to the law as laid down by this Court. In view of the above discussion, we allow this appeal and set-aside the s dated 18.12.2017 and 16.07.2018 passed by the Tribunal in the Original Application and review respectively and the dated 13.11.2018 of the High Court. We also quash the dated 10.11.2023 passed by 154 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. the West Central Railway, Jabalpur Division, Jabalpur. Consequently, we direct that compassionate appointment, in the applicable post, be given to the Appellant’s son Mukesh Mewari within a period of 4 weeks from the date of communication of this . No as to costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Divya Pandey
