1228 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 14. In Bhoop Singh (supra), this Court held that the earlier decree required registration for the reasons as mentioned in paragraph 19. The reasons given in paragraph 19 of the above case has no application in the facts of the present case. 15. This Court in Som Dev v. Rati Ram [(2006) 10 SCC 788] while explaining Section 17(2)(vi) and Sections 17(1) (b) and (c) held that all decrees and s of the Court including compromise decree subject to the exception as referred that the properties that are outside the subject- matter of the suit do not require registration. In para 18, this Court laid down the following: (SCC p. 800) “18. … But with respect, it must be pointed out that a decree or of a court does not require registration if it is not based on a compromise on the ground that clauses (b) and (c) of Section 17 of the Registration Act are attracted. Even a decree on a compromise does not require registration if it does not take in property that is not the subject-matter of the suit.” 16. In the facts of the present case, the decree dated 4-10-1985 was with regard to the property, which was the subject-matter of the suit, hence not covered by exclusionary clause of Section 17(2)(vi) and the present case is covered by the main exception crafted in Section 17(2)(vi) i.e. “any decree or of a court”. When registration of an instrument as required by Section 17(1)(b) is specifically excluded by Section 17(2)(vi) by providing that nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) applies to any decree or of the court, we are of the view that the compromise decree dated 4-10-1985 did not require registration and the learned Civil Judge as well as the High Court erred in holding otherwise. We, thus, set aside the of the Civil Judge dated 7-1- 2015 as well as the of the High Court dated 13-2-2017 [Mohd. Yusuf v. Rajkumar, 2017 SCC OnLine MP 2056]. The compromise decree dated 4-10-1985 is directed to be exhibited by the trial court. The appeal is allowed accordingly.” [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1229 Mukesh v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. 10.1. The s in Mohd Yusuf case (supra)10 and Bhoop Singh (supra) were followed by this court in the following subsequent decisions: (i) Khushi Ram v. Nawal Singh:11 “30. This Court in Rajkumar case [Mohd. Yusuf v. Rajkumar, (2020) 10 SCC 264 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 45] held that since the decree which was sought to be exhibited was with regard to the property which was subject-matter of suit, hence, was not covered by exclusionary clause of Section 17(2)(vi) and decree did not require registration. The issue in the present case is squarely covered by the above . We, thus, conclude that in view of the fact that the consent decree dated 19-8-1991 relates to the subject-matter of the suit, hence it was not required to be registered under Section 17(2)(vi) and was covered by exclusionary clause.
