[Paras 48, 53, 58, 59] Khalsa University (Repeal) Act, 2017 – Constitution of India – Art.14 – Whether the Impugned Act (Khalsa University (Repeal) Act, 2017) is liable to be struck down on the ground of manifest arbitrariness: Held: The only reasoning given in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Impugned Act is that the Khalsa College has, over a period of time, become a significant icon of Khalsa heritage and the University established in 2016 is likely to shadow and damage its character and pristine glory – It is to be noted that the Khalsa College which was established in 1892 is not a part of the Khalsa University – During the course of hearing, a specific statement has been made by the appellants that the Khalsa College would not be affiliated with the Khalsa University – The maps have been placed on record which show the placement of Khalsa College in the campus along with the other institutions – The perusal of the [2024] 10 S.C.R. 447 Khalsa University and Another v. The State of Punjab and Another said map would clearly reveal that it is only the Khalsa College established in 1892 which is a heritage one – All other buildings have been subsequently constructed having no resemblance with the Khalsa College building – It can thus be seen that the very foundation that Khalsa University would shadow and damage the character and pristine glory of Khalsa College which has, over a period of time, become a significant icon of Khalsa heritage is on a non-existent basis – It could thus be seen that the Impugned Act, which was enacted with a purpose which was non-existent, would fall under the ambit of manifest arbitrariness and would therefore be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution – Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that the Impugned Act is also liable to be set aside on the same ground.
