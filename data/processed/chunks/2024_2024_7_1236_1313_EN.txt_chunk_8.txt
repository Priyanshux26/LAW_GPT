1247 Mohd. Abdul Samad v. The State of Telangana & Anr. the enforcement of the 1986 Act, is so significant that it virtually makes Section 3 of the 1986 Act very narrow and insignificant although the expression “provision” under Section 3(1) of the 1986 Act has been broadly interpreted by this Court in Danial Latifi. [Para 40 (v)] [Per B.V. Nagarathna, J. (concurring)] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.125 – Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 – s.3 – Both provisions operate in two separate fields: Held: If a divorced Muslim woman files an application for maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC, there is no provision for considering the same under Section 3 of the 1986 Act – The reasons for the same are not far to see: Firstly, Section 125 of the CrPC and Section 3(1) of the 1986 Act operate in two separate fields – The former is a statutory right created, inter-alia, for all divorced women, irrespective of the faith they may belong to or follow – On the other hand, the 1986 Act is in the nature of a personal law which applies to only divorced Muslim women who were married under Muslim law and divorced under the said law. [Para 40(vii)] [Per B.V. Nagarathna, J. (concurring)] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.125 – Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019: Held: When divorce is void and illegal, such a Muslim woman can seek remedy under Section 125 of the CrPC.
