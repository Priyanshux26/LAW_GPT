56. However, a separate Constitution Bench of this Court in Shiv E Kirpal Singh v. VV Giri,13 held that definitions under the General Clauses Act as modified by the President under the adaptation by virtue of the power conferred under Article 372A do not apply to the interpretation of the Constitution. In this case, the issue was whether the phrase “elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States” in Article 54 (which constitutes the electoral college for the election of the President) would F include the elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of Union territories. This Court answered in the negative. This Court held that the modifications under Article 372A was limited only to the interpretation of laws of Parliament and would not apply to the interpretation of the Constitution because Article 367 stipulates that the General Clauses Act G shall apply to the interpretation of the Constitution, subject to such adaptations made under Article 372. The provision does not provide that the interpretation must also be subject to the adaptation made under Article 372A. Parliament responded to the anomaly created by the 12 (1970) 1 SCC 633 13 AIR 1970 SC 2097 H 534 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A in Shiv Kirpal Singh (supra), and inserted an Explanation to Article 54 by the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act 1992. The Explanation clarifies that the reference to ‘State’ in Articles 54 and 55 would include the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union Territory of Pondicherry for constituting the electoral college for the election of the President. In Shiv Kirpal Singh (supra),this Court did B not refer to the decision in Advance Insurance (supra). Thus, the decision in Shiv Kirpal Singh is per incuriam to the extent of interpretation of Article 372A. 57. The provisions of the General Clauses Act as modified by the President in exercise of the power under Article 372A shall apply to the C interpretation of the Constitution. It cannot be held otherwise merely because Article 367 does not refer to Article 372A. To interpret Article 367 in such a manner would render Article 372A and the amendments in the Constitution by the 1956 Constitution Amendment otiose. The power to make adaptations and modifications was granted to the President by D Article 372A to bring the provisions of law in accordance with the Constitution, as amended by the 1956 Constitution amendment. If Article 367 is interpreted as excluding modifications under Article 372A, there would be an apparent inconsistency between the interpretation of the Constitution and the interpretation of statutes. While in the case of the former, the definition of State prior to the 1956 amendment would apply, E in the case of the latter, the definition as amended by the 1956 amendment would apply. Thus, a literal interpretation of Article 367 would render the Constitution unworkable and would not give effect to the 1956 Constitution Amendment. This Court must render a purposive interpretation of Article 367. Article 367 must be read to mean that the F General Clauses Act, as amended by adaptation and modification s under Article 372 and Article 372A shall apply to the interpretation of the Constitution, unless the context requires.
