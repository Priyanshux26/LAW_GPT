In Norjarl v. Hyundai Heavy Industries, Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed that it is impossible to distinguish contractual matters 104 Province of Bombay v. Khushaldas Advani, 1950 SCC 551. [Justice S R Das (as the learned Chief Justice then was) observed: 80.1. (i) that if a statute empowers an authority, not being a court in the ordinary sense, to decide disputes arising out of a claim made by one party under the statute which claim is opposed by another party and to determine the respective rights of the contesting parties who are opposed to each other, there is a lis and prima facie and in the absence of anything in the statute to the contrary it is the duty of the authority to act judicially and the decision of the authority is a quasi-judicial act; 105 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Limited, 2024 INSC 792 [37] 106 1962 SCC OnLine SC 20 [13] 107 Gary Born (supra) 2111 2226 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports from those of quasi-judicial status.108 Similarly, in ONGC v. Afcons Gunanusa JV, this Court recognized that the rights and duties of arbitrators flow from: (i) the national laws governing arbitration which give a quasi-judicial status to arbitrators wheres they have to act as impartial adjudicators; and (ii) the arbitrator’s contract with the parties which governs many aspects of the arbitrator-party relationship including remuneration, confidentiality, and timelines for completion of arbitral proceedings.109 61. An arbitral tribunal performs a quasi-judicial function because it substantially determines the rights and liabilities of competing parties through adjudicative means.110 The tribunal is generally required to arrive at decisions or awards based on procedural and substantive law. The Arbitration Act allows flexibility to parties to select the procedural and substantive law to be followed by the arbitral tribunal. During the arbitration process, the arbitral tribunal generally meets at a place agreed upon by the parties, considers the statement of claim and defence, conducts oral hearings, and may appoint experts. Thus, arbitral tribunals act judicially to adjudicate the rights of parties. 62. The Arbitration Act is a self-contained code.111 The legal framework contained under the Arbitration Act and the Contract Act recognises and enforces the contractual intention of parties to entrust an arbitral tribunal with the authority to settle their disputes. Section 8 of the Arbitration Act mandates judicial authorities to refer parties to arbitration where there is an arbitration agreement. The other provisions of the Arbitration Act are also geared towards ensuring minimal judicial interference112 in arbitral proceedings and recognizing the competence of the arbitral tribunals to rule on their jurisdiction.113 63. Although the Arbitration Act recognizes the autonomy of parties to decide on all aspects of arbitration, it also lays down a procedural 108 K/S Norjarl A/S v. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., [1992] QB 863 [Lord Browne-Wilkinson in his opinion observed that it is “impossible to divorce the contractual and status considerations: in truth the arbitrator’s rights and duties flow from the conjunction of those two elements.”] 109 ONGC Ltd. v.
