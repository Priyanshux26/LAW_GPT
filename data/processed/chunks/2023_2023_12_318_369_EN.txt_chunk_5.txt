Consequently, the appeal was dismissed. 9.3. Being aggrieved by the passed by CIT(A), the appellant/ assessee fi led further appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”). The ITAT vide dated 23.02.2011 partly allowed the appeal 326 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. and held that the appellant/assessee is a co-operative bank and is not a primary agricultural credit society or a primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank and is consequently hit by the provision of Section 80P (4), thus, the deduction claimed was rightly denied. However, the ITAT also clarifi ed to the extent that the appellant/assessee is acting as a State Land Development Bank which falls within the purview of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development Act, 1981 (“NABARD Act, 1981”, for short) and is exigible for fi nancial assistance from NABARD. Therefore, the appellant/assessee’s claim merits acceptance and it would be entitled to deduction under Section 80P(2)(a)(i) on the income relatable to its lending activities as such a bank. 9.4. Aggrieved by the passed by the ITAT in only partly allowing its appeal, the appellant/assessee preferred an appeal being ITA No. 103 of 2011 against the ITAT’s dated 23.02.2011. The issue raised by the appellant/assessee was with respect to the ITAT’s fi nding that the appellant/ assessee was neither a primary agricultural credit society nor a primary co- operative agricultural and rural development bank, hence, not entitled for exemption of its income under Section 80P(2)(a)(i) of the Act. 9.5. On 26.11.2015, the Kerala High Court dismissed the Assessee’s Appeal, ITA No. 103 of 2011, holding that the ITAT’s fi ndings do not warrant any interference as the case did not involve any substantial question of law. Against the dated 26.11.2015, the appellant/assessee preferred a Special Leave Petition (C) bearing No. 2737 of 2016. This Court vide dated 01.02.2016, issued notice and granted stay of recovery of demand made by the Income Tax Authorities from the appellant/assessee for the AY 2007-08. Submissions: 10. The submissions of learned senior counsel for the appellant and learned ASG for the respondent are as under: 10.1. Learned senior advocate, Sri Krishnan Venugopal, at the outset, submitted that the appellant is aggrieved by the impugned s declining to extend the benefi t of deduction under Section 80P of the Act. He submitted that sub-section (4) of Section 80P is in the nature of an exception which was added subsequently to Section 80P and the said sub-section excludes a KSCARDB v. THE ASSESSING OFFICER, TRIVANDRUM 327 AND ORS. [B.V. NAGARATHNA, J.] ‘co-operative bank’ from the benevolent provision. However, the appellant is not a co-operative bank within the meaning of the said sub-section. On the other hand, the appellant is a ‘co-operative society’ engaged in providing credit facilities to its members who are not individuals but are other co- operative societies and the appellant is an apex co-operative society. 10.2. Highlighting the genesis of the appellant, it was submitted that the appellant was fi rst registered as a co-operative society under the State Act, 1951 and was recognised as a co-operative central land mortgage bank and when theState Act, 1969 was enacted, it was recognised as a co- operative society under the said enactment.
