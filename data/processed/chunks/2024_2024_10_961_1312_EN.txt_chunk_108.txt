286. Considering these aspects, the next point which arises for consideration is whether the right under Article 29(1) can be invoked by the entire section of citizens aiming to preserve their culture or language or if it can be invoked by a few individuals on behalf of the larger section of citizens. In this context, it becomes essential to examine previous decisions of this Court where a violation of Article 29(1) has been put forth to ascertain who the invoking party was. 188 pAsCuAl GisBert, Fundamentals of Sociology, Orient Longman, 1973 (3rd ed. ), 342. 189 BronislAw mAlinowsKi, A Scientific Theory of Culture and Other Essays, The University of North Carolina Press, 1944, 67.) 1116 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 287. In State of Karnataka v. Associated Management of English Medium Primary and Secondary Schools,190 the imposition of a particular language by the State in primary schools was under challenge. Rights under Article 29(1) were asserted by an association representing private schools. Similarly, in State of Bombay v. Bombay Education Society and others,191 the right of the Anglo- Indian community to conserve their culture and language under Article 29(1) was upheld. The parties invoking the right were the Bombay Society and its two directors, which sought to ensure value- based education for the underprivileged. Thus, notwithstanding the language of Article 29(1), it is not necessary that the right must be invoked by the entirety of the section of citizens belonging to a particular community, or that such community must collectively seek redressal. 288. In the instant case, the Petitioners include various Assamese student organisations like the Assam Sanmilita Mahasangha and All Assam Ahom Sabha; their invocation of Article 29(1) is, therefore, maintainable. Furthermore, it is not in dispute before us that there exists a distinct Assamese culture. Indeed, Assam proudly serves as a testament to our nation’s rich culture and diversity, with various groups and sub-groups co-existing harmoniously, including the Koch-Rajbangsi, Bodo, Sonowal Kacharis, Dimasas, and more.192 This cohabitation reflects a cooperative and peaceful integration of diverse cultures within the region. Furthermore, adding to the cultural mosaic, Assam also boasts of linguistic diversity, with over 13 million residents conversing in Assamese and Bengali while also embracing local languages like Karbi, Mishing, Rabha, Tiwa, Dimaca, and more.193 Indeed, the crux of the matter at hand does not revolve around whether Article 29(1) applies to the Petitioners. Instead, the focal point is whether Section 6A by its operation has curtailed the Petitioners’ rights under Article 29 to conserve their distinct culture. 190 State of Karnataka v.

As discussed previously, Article 29(1) aims to ‘conserve’ the language, culture or script of a section of citizens.
