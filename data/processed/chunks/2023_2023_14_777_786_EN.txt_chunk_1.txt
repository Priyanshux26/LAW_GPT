These two appeals challenge the impugned s of the High Court more or less on the same and similar grounds as such have been taken up together and being decided by this common . In Civil Appeal No.5500 of 2011, challenge is to an passed by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court dated 26.03.2010 whereby Writ Petition (Civil) No.1212 of 1995 was dismissed confi rming the of forfeiture of properties under section 7 of The Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 19761. In Criminal Appeal No.730 of 2014, the challenge is to an passed by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court dated 03/17.12.2012 dismissing the Writ Petition No.3878 of 2011 wherein also the of forfeiture of properties under SAFEMA was upheld. 2. Before the High Court, the main ground of challenge in both the cases was that as the detention passed under section 3 of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 19742 has been subsequently revoked/withdrawn as such SAFEMA proceedings would become non est and untenable. An additional ground taken in Civil Appeal No.5500 of 2011 was to the eff ect that even the criminal 1 SAFEMA 2 COFEPOSA 780 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. complaint fi led under the Customs Act, 19623 wherein the appellant had been discharged on the ground that there was no evidence, would further render the proceedings under SAFEMA as untenable. 3. At the outset, the arguments advanced by the learned senior counsel for the appellant appears to be quite attractive and forceful but when the facts and law of the case are scrutinised, we are of the fi rm view that argument has to fail resulting into dismissal of the appeals. 4. For sake of brevity, we are reproducing the facts of Civil Appeal No.5500 of 2011 and will briefl y refer to the facts in the other Criminal Appeal No.730 of 2014. 5. An under section 3(1) of COFEPOSA for detaining the appellant was passed by competent authority on 02.01.1978.
