Single Bench of the High Court, vide dated 25.11.2014 found merit in the arguments raised on behalf of respondent No. 15 and opined that the Committee had the jurisdiction to entertain the issue regarding his social status. 37. The aforesaid passed by the Single Bench was challenged by the appellants by fi ling appeal. The Division Bench, vide impugned dated 30.03.2015 had upheld the passed by the Single Judge holding that the Committee had jurisdiction to enquire into the complaints of illegal cancellation of Caste Certifi cate. 38. As far as the argument regarding jurisdiction of the Committee is concerned, in our opinion, the issue is not required to be gone into in detail at this stage, as the High Court opined that the Committee had jurisdiction to entertain even the issue regarding cancellation of the Caste Certifi cate in terms of Section 8A of the 1994 Act. Though it has not specifi cally been mentioned in the Section, however, vide amendment carried out in the 1994 Act w.e.f. 15.09.2017, clause (c) in Section 8A was substituted to include even the cases regarding cancellation of caste certifi cate. The only issue required to be considered may be as to whether this amendment should be considered to be retrospective or retroactive. However, the fact remains that it being a procedural law and the matter being still pending before the Committee to be decided on merits after it had opined that the Committee had jurisdiction to deal with even the cases of caste certifi cate, it could very well be examined by the Committee at this stage. In the view of that matter, it should have been sent back to the Committee only. 39. However, we do not deem it appropriate to follow that route considering the conduct of the private respondents. The fact which remained undisputed even at the time of hearing is that late father of respondent No. 15 who was in service of the Corporation, never claimed himself to be a person belonging to Scheduled Tribe community. During his life time, he had sold about ten acres of land between 1980 and 1983 including the sale 954 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. deed in question executed in favour of Sanjay Gupta and two others. None of those sale transactions have been challenged by him during his life time or by respondents No. 15 and 16, after his death claiming that the father belonged to Scheduled Tribe community. In fact, there was no certifi cate issued to that extent in his favour. It was the father who had executed the sale deeds. It also came on record that respondent No. 15 had executed the sale deeds I-1039 dated 01.03.2000 and I-575 dated 07.02.2001. Those were also executed without seeking any permission from any authority. There is no challenge to that. Earlier to that, a complaint was fi led for cancellation of the sale deed in question which was closed by the District Magistrate, vide dated 29.08.2000 holding that respondent No.
