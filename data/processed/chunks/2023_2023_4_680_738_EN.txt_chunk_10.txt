The presumption protects social parentage over biological parentage. Scientific proof now makes it possible to know with virtual certainty whether a man is genetically related to a child. As a result, Courts are E routinely confronted with husbands seeking to disavow their paternity based on newly acquired DNA evidence, notwithstanding them having long performed the social role of father to a child. The short question in the present appeal is as to how a Court can prevent the law’s tidy assumptions linking paternity with matrimony, from collapsing, particularly when parties are routinely attempting to dislodge such presumptions by F employing modern genetic profiling techniques.
