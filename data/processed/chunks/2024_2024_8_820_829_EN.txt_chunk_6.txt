In a case of estrangement, the applicant would fall under the category of a ‘special circumstance’ as the rules are silent for such a category. In this regard, Section 7A(3) of the Citizenship Act,1955 was brought to our notice: [2024] 8 S.C.R. 829 Union of India v. Bahareh Bakshi “(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the Central Government may, if it is satisfied that special circumstances exist, after recording the circumstances in writing, register a person as an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder.” 20. Noticing this special provision, we may observe that the present will not come in the way of the Central Government to consider if any special circumstances exists for consideration of the respondent’s application and it will then be open for the respondent to make good her case. However, such discretion is entirely left to the Central Government and we are not expressing any opinion on whether the respondent deserves such consideration or not. 21. With the above, the appeals are allowed by interfering with the impugned s. Pending application(s), if any, stand closed. Result of the case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
