[2023] 13 S.C.R. 1071 : 2023 INSC 1026 CASE DETAILS VISHNU KUMAR SHUKLA & ANR. v. THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ANR. NOVEMBER 28, 2023 (Criminal Appeal No. 3618 of 2023) [VIKRAM NATH AND AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Whether the passed by the High Court refusing to discharge the accused in a criminal case and quashing an FIR calls for interference. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 239-240 – Trial of warrant- cases by Magistrates – Application for discharge – Permissible extent of scrutiny – On facts, refusal of the High Court to discharge the accused- appellant in a criminal case and quash an FIR – Interference with: Held: Case for interference made out – There is no suspicion, much less strong or grave suspicion that the appellants are guilty of the off ence alleged, u/ss. 448, 454 and 380 IPC – Criminal case against the appellants amounts to clear abuse of the process of the Court – It would be unjustifi ed to make the appellants face a full-fl edged criminal trial – Appellants are to be protected against vexatious and unwarranted criminal prosecution, and from unnecessarily being put through the rigours of an eventual trial, either through quashing a FIR/Complaint or by allowing an appeal against an rejecting discharge or by any other legally permissible route, as the circumstances may be, in the deserving case, is a duty cast on the High Courts – High Court should have intervened and discharged the appellants – Thus, there not being suffi cient material on record to proceed against the appellants, they are discharged – Impugned of the High Court as well as the of the trial court dismissing the prayer for discharge are are unreasoned and set aside. [Para 14, 23, 24] 1071 107 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 239-240 – Trial of warrant- cases by magistrates – Discharging of accused – Framing of charges – Reliance on Minakshi Bala’s case which held that at the stage of framing of charges, the court cannot usurp functions of a trial court to delve into and decide upon respective merits: Held: If Minakshi Bala’s case is accepted as it, the necessary concomitant would be that despite examining the matter in detail, a court would fi nd its freedom restricted while considering the discharge application – This would amount to forcing a person to stand trial, even when ‘overwhelming’ material points to his/her innocence – Obviously, hands of a Court ought not to be tied down, and not against liberty – Thus, Minakshi Bala’s case is doubted on the limited aspect, however, not referred to the larger bench for reconsideration observing that the same would be done in a more appropriate case – Precedent.
