The present set of appeals has its genesis in the three complaints filed by the complainant-respondent before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum-II, New Delhi3, bearing Nos. C-252 of 2006, C-283 of 2006 and C-284 of 2006 alleging deficiency of service on the part of the present appellants for having failed to deliver the possession of three flats booked by her, even after expiry of the agreed period and B despite the fact that she had admittedly made payment of 60% of the total sale consideration. The District Forum, in its dated 20.12.2013, dismissed the complaints so filed by the present respondent on various grounds including that she had tried to avail of the services of the builder for commercial purposes by booking three flats and thus, did not fall C within the category of “consumer”, as defined under Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 19864. 2.2. In the said and dated 12.03.2020, the State Commission, however, disapproved the so passed by the District Forum as regards the maintainability of complaints and then, particularly D with reference to the decision in the case of Dr. Manjeet Kaur Monga v. K.L. Suneja: (2018) 14 SCC 6795, wherein the award of compound interest by Competition Appellate Tribunal6 under the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 19697 was not interfered with by this Court, granted relief to the complainant in the manner that the appellants shall refund the amount deposited by her together with ‘compound E interest at the rate of 14% from the date of deposit’.
