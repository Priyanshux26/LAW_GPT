22. After making such observation, the trial Court held that there was no other alternative except to hold the accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 guilty for causing the disappearance of the body by mutilating it and accordingly guilty of the offence under Section 201 read with 738 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Section 34, IPC. In the above circumstances, the observations and findings at paragraph 108 of the impugned of the High Court can only be qua accused Nos.1, 2 and 4. 23. Now, it is to be noted that on another count, the Trial Court held accused Nos.3, 5, 6 and 7 guilty of the offence under Section 201, IPC. In paragraph 85 of the of trial Court it was observed and held: - “……A false record came to be prepared about escape of Shama @ Kalya. Apart from that even the arrest of Shama @ Kalya and taking him for the purpose of investigation itself was a false preparation of the record and thus false information. All the accused No. 1 to 7 seem to have been involved in this drama played in the night on 24.12.1995 right from showing of arrest of Shama @ Kalya. Therefore, so far as offence U/s. 201 of IPC is concerned I hold the accused No. 3,5 to 7 guilty for giving false information which they knew it to be false.” 24. The judgement of the trial Court would further reveal that on 17.02.1997 when it was brought to notice that while typing the final , conviction in respect of the offences under Sections 201, 218 read with Section 34, IPC were not typed due to oversight and bona fide mistake, a corrigendum of the of conviction was issued on 17.02.1997 on the following lines: - “Accused No. 1 to 7 are convicted of the offence under Section 201, 218 R/w Section 34 of IPC and are sentenced to suffer R.I. for one year and to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/- each in default to suffer further S.I. for four months on each count”. 25. Thus, it can be seen that though on different counts the trial Court held accused Nos.1 to 7 guilty under Section 201, IPC the High Court acquitted accused 1, 2 and 4 of the charge under Section 201 read with Section 34, IPC only in respect of causing disappearance of body by mutilating it. Therefore, the question is whether the acquittal of the accused Nos. 1, 2 and 4 under Section 201 read with Section 34, IPC by the High Court got any impact on accused Nos. 2 and 4 as also accused Nos.3 and 5 to 7 in relation to the other count, referred hereinbefore. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 739 Manik & Ors. v. The State of Maharashtra 26. Now, in the impugned common , the High Court after reversing the finding of the trial Court on the evidence based on fingerprint test held that the charge in relation to the screening of evidence by mutilating the dead body of Shama @ Kalya was not proved but failure of prosecution in identification of dead body of Shama would not exonerate the accused from the charge of the screening evidence and other charges.
