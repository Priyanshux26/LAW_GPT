[Para 33] Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 1996 – r.19 – Constitution of India – Article 20(1) – Substituted Rule imposed lesser penalty than the repealed rule if permissible limits of loss of liquor exceeded – Bar of Article 20(1) imposing a penalty greater than the one in force at the time of the commission of the offence, if applicable: 668 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: No – The substituted penalty only mollifies the rigour of the law by reducing the penalty from four times the duty to value of the duty – Therefore, the bar of Article 20(1) of imposing a penalty greater than the one in force at the time of the commission of the offence has no application – Single Judge was of the view that the amendment by way of substitution had the effect of repealing the law which existed as on the date of repeal – Division Bench on the other hand, held that levy of penalty was substantive law, and as such, it cannot operate retrospectively – Reasoning of both, rejected.
