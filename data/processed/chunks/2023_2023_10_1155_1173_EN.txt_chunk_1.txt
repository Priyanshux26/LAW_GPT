No further appeal to this Court is provided against the passed by the NCDRC in exercise of its powers conferred under Section 21(a)(ii) of the Act 1986. There is no provision for D filing any further appeal against the passed on the appeal filed against the of the SCDRC. In such circumstances, the petitioner has come before this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. [Para 18][1162-F-H; 1163-A] 1.3 The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to grant special E leave to appeal can be invoked in very exceptional circumstances. The question of law of general public importance or a decision which shocks the conscience of the Court are some of the prime requisites for the grant of special leave. The provisions of Article 136 of the Constitution as such are not circumscribed by any F limitation. But when the party aggrieved has alternative remedy to go before the High Court, invoking its writ jurisdiction or supervisory jurisdiction as the case may be, this Court should not entertain petition seeking special leave thereby short-circuit the legal procedure prescribed. The limitation, whatever, they be are implicit in the nature and character of the power itself. It G being an exceptional and overriding power, naturally it has to be exercised sparingly and with caution and only in very exceptional situations. The power will only be used to advance the cause of justice and its exercise will be governed by well-established H M/S UNIVERSAL SOMPO GENERAL INSURANCE CO. LTD. v. 1157 SURESH CHAND JAIN AND ANR. principles which govern the exercise of overriding constitutional A powers. [Para 24][1165-F-H] 1.4 In view of the aforesaid, this petition should not be adjudicated on merits. The petitioner must be asked to first go before the jurisdictional High Court either by way of a writ application under Article 226 of the Constitution or by invoking B the supervisory jurisdiction of the jurisdictional High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution. Of course, after the High Court adjudicates and passes a final , it is always open for either of the parties to thereafter come before this Court by filing special leave petition, seeking leave to appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution.
