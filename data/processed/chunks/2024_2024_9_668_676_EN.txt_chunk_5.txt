They should have been eschewed. The perception of justice to every segment of society is as important as the rendition of justice as an objective fact. 18. Since the Judge of the High Court of Karnataka is not a party to these proceedings, we desist from making any further observations, save and except to express our serious concern about both the reference to gender and to a segment of the community. Such observations are liable to be construed in a negative light thereby impacting not only the court of the Judge who expressed them, but the judicial system as well. 19. We have made these observations in the hope and expectation that the demands which have been placed on all stake holders in the judicial system in the electronic age would elicit an appropriate modulation of behaviour both on the part of the Bar and the Bench in the future. 20. The proceedings shall stand concluded with these observations. 21. Pending application, if any, stands disposed of. Result of the Case: Proceedings concluded. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
