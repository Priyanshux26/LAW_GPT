The Court declared the law to be prospective, but gave relief to the employees before the Court. The correctness of Ramzan Khan (supra) came up before a Constitution Bench in Managing Director, ECIL v. B Karunakar.21 The Constitution Bench upheld Ramzan Khan (supra). It was further held that the law laid down in Ramzan Khan (supra) cannot be applied retrospectively because: a. the legal position on furnishing the report of an enquiry officer to the delinquent employee was unsettled before Ramzan Khan (supra); b. the authorities had proceeded on the assumption that there was no requirement to furnish a copy of the enquiry report to the delinquent officer; and c. reopening of all disciplinary proceedings before Ramzan Khan (supra) would result in grave prejudice to the administration which outweighed the benefit to the employees. 17 L Chandra Kumar v.

M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. Hence, it was held that no proceedings before the decision in Ramzan Khan (supra) should be challenged on the ground that there was a failure to furnish the enquiry report. D. A pragmatic solution to reconcile the conflicting interests 13. In India Cement (supra), a Bench of seven Judges of this Court held that royalty is tax. Resultantly, it was held that the State legislatures have no legislative competence to impose cess on royalty under Entries 23 and 50 of List II. Fifteen years later, a Constitution Bench in Kesoram (supra) held that royalty is not a tax. It was further held that the power to levy tax on mineral rights vests with the State legislatures and is subject to any limitations laid down by Parliament by law relating to mineral development. Given this divergence, a reference was made to a larger Bench. MADA (supra) has laid down the principles for interpreting Entry 54 of List I and Entries 23 and 50 of List II. In the process, this Court overruled India Cement (supra). 14. The doctrine of prospective overruling has been applied by this Court in situations where the new declaration results in the invalidation of legislation, which would otherwise have been valid under the old declaration.22 The doctrine has also been used where this Court has declared a legislation as ultra vires.23 In the case of taxing statutes, such a declaration would make the State liable to refund all amounts collected under the invalid legislation. Therefore, this Court declares the new rule to apply prospectively not only to secure the revenues of the State but also to protect the rights and obligations crystallized by persons and entities under the old regime.24 15.
