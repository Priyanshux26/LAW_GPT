However, the name of the answering respondent has been cleared in 35 out of 37 cases inter-alia at the stage of Inquiry/Investigation itself and the proceedings against the answering respondent have been stayed by the Hon’ble High Court at the Judicature of Allahabad in the remaining 2 cases. Pertinently, in none of the cases, the answering respondent has been put to trial, which is indicative of the fact that answering respondent has been falsely implicated in false and frivolous cases. 792 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 11-12…. 13. Succinctly stated, on 28.06.2013 one Bhagwan Singh i.e., the father of the alleged victim, lodged an FIR bearing Case Crime No. 443/13 under sections 363 and 366 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, at P.S Sahaswan, Badaun, against (i) Sukhpal, (ii) Smt. Chetinya wife of Jaywahan, (iii) Jaywahan and (iv) Shyam Singh by alleging therein that these four persons have taken his daughter who was allegedly minor at that point in time. A copy of the FIR dated 28.06.2013 and identified as Case Crime No. 443/13 under sections 363 and 366 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, at P.S Sahaswan, Badaun is already annexed as Annexure P-1 in the SLP. 14-15…. 16. That it is pertinent to mention that the name of the answering respondent is nowhere to be seen till this stage i.e. he has not been named anywhere, (i) either in the FIR filed by the father of Victim or (ii) in the Writ Petition filed by the victim herself before the High Court nor (iii) in the statement of the victim when she appeared in person before the Honourable High Court. However, very surprisingly, when pursuant to the High Court , the statement of the victim was recorded by the police under section 161 CRPC, and also under section 164, CRPC, on 22.08.2013 i.e. after about two months of the alleged incident, then, the victim for the very first time introduces a new story and says that the answering respondent has did wrong thing on her person when she reached Ghaziabad for eight days i.e., on 24.06.2023 till 01.07.2023. 17-21…. 22. That, on 20.12.2013 after a thorough investigation, the investigating officer closed the investigation in crime case no. 443/13 qua the answering respondent herein vide supplementary chargesheet no. 1. At this juncture it is extremely pertinent to mention that the petitioner or the victim herein did not even file any protest petition regarding the closure of the case. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 793 Bhagwan Singh v. State of U.P. & Ors. 23. However, after a gap of more than 5 years i.e., on 20.06.2018 the victim moved an application before the court of the Ld. A.C.J.M-II class, Badaun praying that the police have not taken any steps to the accused and therefore S.H.O. Sahaswan be directed to arrest the accused and put them to trial. That as the said application of the victim was rejected by the court, therefore, the victim preferred a Criminal Misc. Application (482 Cr.P.C.)
