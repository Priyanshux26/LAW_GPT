Thus, in the absence of the post being vacant on 07.01.1993, the appointment of Respondent No.5 on the said single post held by Mr. Kapil Sasmal, Respondent No.5 could not have been appointed by way of the resolution dated 07.01.1993 followed by the appointment letter, which came to be issued on 10.01.1993. We may, in addition, note that when the interim dated 11.01.1993 passed in OJC No.80 of 1993 was vacated, the term of the Managing Committee approved on 15.12.1992 was already over. Therefore, from 11.01.1993 till 14.12.1995, the Committee constituted on 15.12.1992 was functioning in terms of the interim of the High Court. It is also noteworthy that the High Court only took a view with regard to reconstitution of the Managing Committee and even in its fi nal dated 23.07.1999, there is no whisper that any/all action(s) taken by the Managing Committee constituted on 15.12.1992, even though in terms of the interim of the High Court, would lose their effi cacy and/or validity. 16. It is also noted that the Respondent No.5, for the fi rst time, raised the issue before the Tribunal challenging the approval dated 02.04.2005 of the appellant on the basis of resolution dated 07.01.1993 of the Managing Committee constituted on 28.12.1992. In the period of over 12 years (from 07.01.1993 to 04.05.2005), Respondent No.5 had not moved before any 412 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. forum, be it a Court of Law or a Tribunal or an Authority asserting his claims qua the solitary post of PET in the School in question. 17. On the legal aspect, since the Managing Committee constituted on 15.12.1992 continued for its full term by virtue of the interim of the High Court dated 11.01.1993 and even in the fi nal disposing of the case on 23.07.1999, no adverse comment made on actions taken by the said Managing Committee, coupled with the fact that the appellant continued to discharge the duties on the post right since his appointment on 14.05.1994, which is documented in the school register and verifi ed by the Inspector of Schools, with his having been sent on election duty thrice, in our view, are suffi cient pointers that the appellant had actually worked and continued on the post. Further, there was no complaint before any authority, either with regard to the appellant not joining or discharging his duty or the Respondent No.5 being prevented from joining or discharging his duty, from any quarter, much less, Respondent No.5 himself, till 2005. Even with regard to the fi nding of Respondent No.5 having worked in another school during the period in question, such fi nding has not really been contested. In any event, the material sought to disprove such factual assertion is not quite forthcoming from the record. 18. An issue that deserves some attention, as per Respondent No.5, is that since the Sri Thakur Nigamananda High School, Terundia got permission in 2000 and received recognition in 2002, the Respondent No.5 could not have been working there from 04.01.1995 to 18.08.2002.
