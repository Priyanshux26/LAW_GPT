66 2022 (16) SCR 1. 650 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. (i) ₹1.5 crores as travelling expenses, for his treatment, incurred- every month from his house to New Delhi, (ii) ₹ 50 lakhs as the expenses for his medicines, (iii) ₹ 1.53 crores for loss of salary, from the date of his retirement due to not giving extension till the age of superannuation, (iv) ₹1.5 crores as medical -expenses which he is required to incur due to the non-availability of medical services and an immunologist at his home town, (v) ₹10 crores for violation of his human rights, ₹ 40 crores for mental and social agony, and ₹40 crores for his defamation. (ii) The total salary claimed per annum was ₹ 10,89,052 / - (i.e. ₹ 89,921/- per month multiplied by twelve months); to the total salary for the “leftover period of service from 31 May, 2016 to 31 May 2033. )” calculated @ ₹ 5,44,526/-; plus a sum of ₹ 10,89,052 multiplied by 12 (number of years left, till the age of 58 years) ₹ 2,80,97,541.60, added to which the appellant claims a factor of 1.6 (for future prospects). The total thus worked out is ₹ 50,57,55,748.80. 81. The appellant’s claim of ₹ 89,921/- per month, is based on the calculation that he would have earned, had he been in service if the seventh pay commission pay fi xation and adjustment were provided. However, he was discharged from service on 31.05.2016. He claimed, in addition, a host of allowances (dearness allowance, family assistance, house rent allowance, good conduct allowance, etc.). No doubt these factors have to be considered when loss of earnings or income is to be calculated. However, all allowances cannot be granted, towards loss of earnings. This court is cognizant of the fact that the appellant has also been drawing pension (including disability pension which is now in the range of about ₹ 6000/- per month). Even if the appellant’s calculation about loss of future earnings were to be taken into account, given that he has been a pensioner, for the past 7 years, adjustment of the base compensation fi gure for compensation for loss of earnings has to be given. Therefore, taking a conservative consolidated fi gure of ₹ 65,000/- per month, if the average pension earned is pegged @ ₹ 25,000/- per month, the total fi gure he would be entitled towards loss of earning, for seven years, would be about ₹ 33,60,000/-. The fi gure could be rounded off , appropriately, to ₹ 35,00,000/-. The court would then, have CPL ASHISH KUMAR CHAUHAN (RETD.) v. COMMANDING 651 OFFICER & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] to take into account, the appellant’s age, as of date, which is 47 years. Again, if a multiplier of 12 is applied to determine compensation for loss of future income, including adding 40% towards loss of future prospects, the fi gure would be ₹ 80,64,000/-. The total amount, (i.e., ₹ 35,00,000/- plus ₹ 80,64,000/-) would be ₹ 1,15,64,000/- (Rupees one crore fi fteen lakhs sixty four thousand only).
