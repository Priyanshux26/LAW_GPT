The High Court, in para 23 of the , observes that the total income of the claimant-appellant was Rs.27,867/- per month. 50% thereof is Rs.13,933/-. His income, therefore, comes to Rs.41,800/- (27,867 + 13,933). Considering the above-computed income, the compensation under the head loss of future prospects would be Rs.41,800 x 12 x 15 x 100% = Rs.75,24,000/- as opposed to Rs.70,22,520/- as calculated by the High Court. 6 [2019] 8 SCR 986 : (2019) 7 SCC 217 7 (2020) 9 SCC 805 8 Claim petition, Annexure A-3 842 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The total compensation as it stands at the moment would be Rs.80,67,870/- + Rs.6,61,371/- = Rs.87,29,241/-. 11. Let us now consider the claimant-appellant’s prayer for enhancement of compensation under the head ‘pain and suffering’. It cannot be disputed that the injuries sustained by the claimant-appellant are serious, and their effects on his life are long-lasting; one may even say lifelong. The examination of the doctor, namely, Dr. N.C. Prakash, forming part of record as Annexure P-5, dated 6th October 2010 reads as under: “5. I further state that recently I examined the patient on 30-9-2010 for assessment of disability. He complains of the following: a. No sensation to below the C-7 Dermatome. b. Lost sensation of bowel and urinary system. c. No control below the neck. d. Needs assistance for every activity. 6. On examination I found the following: At present he is in wheel chair bound with no movements (Grade 0/5) in both lower limbs, minimal movements in bilateral upper limb proximally with wrist being very weak (1/5 power) and grip is not possible. He has no urinary control, has no sensation of bowels and is on urinary catheter. He needs help for all his day to day activities. He was an Assistant Team Leader in LM Glass Fibers India Pvt. Ltd. and now can’t do any work. He has almost no chance of further improvement and impairment is likely to be permanent. All put together he has a disability of about 85% to the whole body.” 12. It is to be noted that both the Tribunal and the High Court have taken the disability suffered by the claimant-appellant to be at 100%. We find no ground to take a different view. 13. While acknowledging that ‘pain and suffering’, as a concept escapes definition, we may only refer to certain authorities, scholarly as also judicial wherein attempts have been made to set down the contours thereof. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 843 K.S. Muralidhar v. R. Subbulakshmi & Anr. 13.1 The entry recording the term ‘pain and suffering’ in P. Ramanatha Iyer’s Advanced Law Lexicon9 reads as under:- “Pain and suffering. The term ‘Pain and suffering’ mean physical discomfort and distress and include mental and emotional trauma for which damages can be recovered in an accident claim. This expression has become almost a term of art, used without making fine distinction between pain and suffering. Pain and suffering which a person undergoes cannot be measured in terms of money by any mathematical calculation.
