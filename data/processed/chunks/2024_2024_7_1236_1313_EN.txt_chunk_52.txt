In other words, if there is no such concurrence by the former husband then the aforesaid provisions of the CrPC would not be made applicable to a proceeding initiated under sub-section (2) of Section 3. Such a fetter, in my view, is of no consequence if a Muslim divorced woman can unilaterally maintain an application under Section 125 of the CrPC before the Magistrate or the Family Court, in which event when she unilaterally files such an application, there is no necessity of seeking a declaration from the former husband as required under Section 5 of the 1986 Act. vii. On the other hand, if a divorced Muslim woman files an application for maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC, there is no provision for considering the same under Section 3 of the 1986 Act. The reasons for the same are not far to see: firstly, because Section 125 of the CrPC and Section 3(1) of the 1986 Act operate in two separate fields. The former is a statutory right created, inter alia, for all divorced women, irrespective of the faith they may belong to or follow. On the other hand, the 1986 Act is in the nature of a personal law which applies to only divorced Muslim women who were married under Muslim law and divorced under the said law. viii. While under the CrPC prior to CrPC of 1973, the alteration of maintenance was considered on the basis of change in circumstances but Section 127(3)(b) of the CrPC, 1973 specifically takes into account cases where a divorced woman has had the benefit of maintenance under the customary or personal law. In a case of a Hindu divorced woman, it could also include the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1954. In the same manner in the case of a Muslim divorced woman, the 1986 Act is in the nature of a quasi-personal law. Section 127(3)(b), therefore, balances the obligation to pay maintenance by a former husband of a Muslim woman if he has done so under the provisions of any customary or personal law which would also include the 1986 Act applicable to the parties. In such an event, there could always be an alteration in the allowance when there is a change in the circumstances of any person receiving, under Section 1308 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 125 of the CrPC, a monthly allowance towards the interim maintenance or maintenance under the said Section payable to a divorced wife. In which event, the alteration could be made in accordance with Section 127 of the CrPC. ix. Section 127 would apply only when there has already been an for maintenance or interim maintenance passed under Section 125 of the CrPC and if there is a subsequent passed under the provisions of the 1986 Act. Then, an for alteration in the maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC could be made by the Magistrate. Section 127(3)(b) would however not detract a divorced Muslim woman from filing an application under Section 125 of the CrPC, by exercising her option to do so even in the absence of invoking the provisions of the 1986 Act.
