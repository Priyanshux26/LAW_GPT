39 of the JJ Act – Section 46 is a provision that requires the State Governments to frame rules to provide financial support to any child living in a child care institution upon completion of 18 years of age – The financial support has to be very exhaustive as the object of financial support is to facilitate a child’s re-integration into mainstream society – In the instant case, these statutory provisions were overlooked entirely, a situation was created which did not allow the victim to make an informed choice about her future – She did not get that opportunity even after attaining majority.
