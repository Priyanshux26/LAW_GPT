As far as Civil Appeal Nos. 1890-1891 of 2010 are concerned, we are of the view that in view of the fact that there appears to have been a kachha road, even at the B time of the gift executed as early as in February, 1994 and it was being used as a road by large numbers of members of the public to reverse the position on the ground, may produce a great deal of injustice, which we would avoid by resorting to the principle enunciated in the decision of this Court referred to in Taherakhatoon (D) By LRs. v. C Salambin Mohammad70. However, if the property gifted is in excess of the area used for the road, we direct that the excess land shall be used for the purpose of OSR only.We also direct that the Authority may consider making available the maintenance of the said area to the appellants, namely, D Association of Vasanth Apartments Owners, if they are prepared to maintain it in terms of the observations contained in this . 179. Civil Appeals 1890-1891 of 2010 are disposed of. The other Appeals and the Writ Petition will stand dismissed subject to the E observations/directions we have made earlier. No as to costs. Bibhuti Bhushan Bose Appeals and Writ Petition disposed of. (Assisted by : Shubhash Thakur and Rahul Rathi, LCRAs) F G H 70 (1999) 2 SCC 635
