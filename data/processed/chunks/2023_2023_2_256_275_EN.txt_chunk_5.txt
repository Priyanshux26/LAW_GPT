That apart, the possession handed over to the appellants has been upheld. 9. Learned counsel further submits that after taking holistic view of the Act, 1954 and of Act 1957, even after declaration of urbanization G by issuance of notification under Section 507(a) of the Act 1957, it will not cease the right of the parties inter se conferred under provisions of the Act 1954. There is no provision under the Act, 1957 which may suggest issuance of the notification of urbanizing under Section 507(a) of the Act ceases automatically the provisions of the Act 1954. That H apart, Section 150(3) of the Act, 1954 specifically provides for the MOHINDER SINGH(DEAD) THROUGH LRS AND ANOTHER 263 v. NARAIN SINGH AND OTHERS [AJAY RASTOGI, J.] consequences when whole of Gaon Sabha cease to be a rural area by A virtue of Section 507 of the Act, 1957. The consequence of dissolution of Gaon Sabha and sub- clause (e) of Section 150(3) specifically says that the provisions of this Act, 1954 shall apply. 10. Learned counsel submits that the Act, 1954 is one such law which is a special Act relating to land reforms by virtue of Section 1(2) B which extends to the whole of the UT of Delhi. The area covered under Act, 1957 is not so excluded. It creates rights of tenure holders and Bhumidhar within the ambit of Section 5 and such rights can be acquired in various ways. Under Chapter III, Section C relates to user of land and Section D pertains to transfer of land by Bhumidhar and Section E C pertains to devolution and Section F pertains to partition. Thus, Act, 1954 is a special code pertaining to the rights of Bhumidhar and other tenure holders. 11. Learned counsel further submits that so far as the Act, 1957 is concerned, it is the Act which deals with Delhi Municipal Corporation. D There is nothing in the Act, 1957 to suggest that it purports to regulate the tenure of Bhumidhar in the UT of Delhi after the urbanization of area is notified. Since the purport of Act, 1957 is not to govern the holding of the tenure, it has been specifically provided by Section 502 that other laws are not to be disregarded for the time being in force. E 12. In substance, learned counsel submits that Act, 1954 continues to operate even after urbanization under Section 507(a) of the Act, 1957 and further submits that the finding returned by the Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned is not legally sustainable and deserves to be interfered with by this Court. In support of his submission, learned counsel has placed reliance on the of this Court in Om F Prakash Agarwal and Others Vs. Batara Behera and Others1. 13. Learned counsel further submits that the Division Bench of the High Court has not taken note of the earlier view expressed by the Division Bench of the High Court in Umed Singh Vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi and Others2and that the earlier Division Bench of the High Court G also considered the scheme of Act, 1957 and Act, 1954 and has returned a finding that on issuance of notification under Section 507(a) of the Act 1957, it may not cease the rights of the parties inter se existing under 11999(3) SCC 231 21997 SCC Online Del 842 H 264 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R.
