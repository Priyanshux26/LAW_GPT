Therefore, the impugned s in Civil Appeal No.5932 of 2023 are set aside. Appeal is allowed. Writ Petition (C) No.123 of 2024 is dismissed. However, this will not preclude Pranav from applying for citizenship by invoking clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act. It will also be open for him to apply to the Central Government for the exercise of power under sub-section (1A) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act of relaxation of the period of twelve months provided in clause (f) of sub-section (1) Section 5 of the 1955 Act.
