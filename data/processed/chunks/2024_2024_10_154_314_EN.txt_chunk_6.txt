163 Just Rights for Children Alliance & Anr. v. S. Harish & Ors. said act(s) had not been done for the purpose of either reporting or for use as evidence – Further, for the purpose of sub-section (3) the prosecution must establish the storage or possession of such material and further prove any fact that might indicate that the same had been done to derive some form of gain or benefit or the expectation of some gain or benefit. [Para 222] Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s.30 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.482 – Presumption u/s.30, if can be resorted to in a quashing proceeding – Two videos depicting children involved in a sexual activity were recovered from the mobile phone of respondent no.1- accused – FIR alleged offences u/ss.14(1) of the POCSO and 67B of the IT Act, however, in the chargesheet, the offence u/s.14(1) of the POCSO was substituted and instead offence u/s.15(1) of the POCSO was alleged – Criminal proceedings quashed by High Court – Correctness: Held: There is no bar for the High Court to invoke the statutory presumption at the stage of deciding the quashing petition in respect to any offence to which such a presumption is applicable – The statutory presumption envisaged under Section 30 of the POCSO is applicable and can be invoked in any proceeding which involves an offence under the said Act that requires a culpable mental state, irrespective of the court where such proceeding is taking place – Once the investigation is over and chargesheet is filed, the FIR pales into insignificance – Child pornographic material that was recovered from the personal mobile phone of the accused which was regularly in use by him, which prima facie establishes the storage or possession of child pornographic material – Further, since the aforesaid child pornographic material was found to have been stored in the said personal mobile phone since 2016 and 2019, prima facie there was a failure on his part to delete, destroy or report such material – High Court failed to advert to Section 15 of the POCSO especially when the chargesheet had already been filed at the time of passing of the Impugned and erred in quashing the criminal proceedings – In view of the statutory presumption of culpable mental state being attracted, any defence of the accused such as the absence of knowledge or intention would be a matter of trial – Absence of culpable mental state has to be established before the trial court by leading cogent evidence in that regard, such defences should not be looked into at this stage – Impugned set aside, criminal proceedings restored.

Digital Supreme Court Reports Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.482 – Duty of High Court – Quashing of criminal proceedings, when justified – Discussed. Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 – s.15 – Ignorance of law vis-à-vis incognizance of law – Ignorance of law, when can be used as a valid defence – Plea of the accused that he was unaware that storing of child-pornography was a punishable offence under Section 15 of POCSO along with the bona-fide belief that such storage was not an offence: Held: Rejected – For a plea of ignorance of law, the ignorance or mistake of law must be such which legitimately gives rise to a bona-fide belief of the existence of a right or a claim, and the said person commits any act on the strength of such right or claim – Even if a person is unaware that the possession or storage of such material is punishable, it by no stretch can be considered to give rise to any right or assertion as there exists no such right to either store or possess such material, and thus it is not a valid defence – No person of an ordinary prudent mind with the same degree of oblivion or unawareness as to the law, more particularly Section 15 of POCSO could as a natural corollary be led to a belief of existence of a right to store or possess any child pornographic material – The ignorance or unawareness must have a reasonable nexus with the right or assertion claimed i.e., the ignorance or unawareness must be such which could legitimately and reasonably give rise to a corresponding right or claim and the existence of which must be bona-fidely believed – Thus, even if the accused was unaware about Section 15 of POCSO, this by itself does not give rise to a corresponding legitimate or reasonable ground to believe that there was any right to store or possess child pornographic material – As such the four-prong test for a valid defence is not fulfilled and the defence of ignorance of law by the accused fails – Even otherwise, one must be mindful to the fact that such a plea is not a statutory defence with any legal backing, but rather a by-product of the doctrine of equity – Unawareness or incognizance of law should not be conflated with ignorance of law.
