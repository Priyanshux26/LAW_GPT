Article 357(2) states that the law enacted by Parliament or the President or any other authorised body which it otherwise would not have been competent to enact but for the Proclamation under Article 356 shall continue to remain in force even after the Proclamation ceases to operate. It shall continue to remain in force unless the State legislature or any authority alters, repeals or amends the law. b. Interpreting Article 356 in the aftermath of SR Bommai 183. This Court has in earlier s interpreted the scope of the power of the President to issue a Proclamation under Article 356. The approach of this Court towards interpreting the scope of this unique power of the Union Government which correspondingly reduces the autonomy of States has undergone a sea-change from the decision of a seven-Judge Bench 176 Article 256(5) 177 First proviso to Article 356(4) 110 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India178 to a decision of a nine-Judge Bench in SR Bommai v. Union of India179. 184. The factual matrix in State of Rajasthan (supra) was as follows: the candidates of the Congress party were defeated in the elections to the Lok Sabha in nine Congress-ruled States in the elections of 1977 held after the end of the national Emergency in 1975. The Home Minister of the Union Government which was headed by a coalition of parties under the banner of Janata alliance wrote to the Chief Minister of each of the States to consider advising the Governor to dissolve the legislative assembly. Six States (Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, and Orissa) fi led suits seeking a declaration that the letter of the Home Minister was ultra vires the Constitution, and sought an injunction restraining the Union Government from resorting to Article 356 of the Constitution. This Court while dismissing the writ petitions and suits held: a. The actions of the Governor under Article 356 can be both “preventive or curative” because Article 355 vests the Union Government with a duty to ensure that the Government of the State is carried out in accordance with the Constitution;180 b. The grounds for judicial review of a Proclamation under Article 356 are limited. The Court can only interfere with the decision on grounds of mala fi des or if there were extraneous considerations;181 c. The independence of States only lasts when the State executive and legislature have not violated their constitutional duties. If they have, the Union is capable of enforcing its views on such matters to enable the Constitution to work in a manner that the Union Government wants it to;182 d. The President while exercising power under Article 356 can “take over all the functions of the Governor” to themselves,183 and “can do 178 (1977) 3 SCC 392 179 (1994) 3 SCC 1 180 Chief Justice Beg (paragraph 45) 181 Justice Bhagwati (paragraph 150) 182 Chief Justice Beg (paragraph 37) 183 Chief Justice Beg (paragraph 66) IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 111 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] whatever the Governor could in exercise of such power.”184 It would be immaterial if the consequence of the exercise of power is fi nal and irrevocable.
