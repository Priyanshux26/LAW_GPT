[Para 31] Madhya Pradesh General Clauses Act, 1957 – s.31 – Application of Act to Ordinances and Regulations - “unless there is anything repugnant in the subject and context” – Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 1996 – r.19 – By virtue of s.31, the provisions of the 1957 Act were made applicable to the construction of rules – By such application, the principle of a repeal of a provision not affecting any liability incurred thereunder was also extended to the operation of the subordinate legislations under the Act – Therefore, the respondent-State submitted that having incurred the liability of exceeding the prescribed limits of losses of liquor for the license period 2009-10, the liability is not affected by the subsequent substitution of r.19: Held: Conscious of the big leap to extend the 1957 Act, for construction of subordinate legislations, s.31 took care to provide that it may be done only when it is not repugnant to the subject and context – If the amendment of r.19 by way of a substitution in 2011 [2024] 4 S.C.R. 667 Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. intended to reduce the quantum of penalty for better administration and regulation of foreign liquor, there is no justification to ignore the subject and context of the amendment and permit the State to recover the penalty as per the unamended Rule. [Paras 23, 32] Interpretation of Statutes – Interpretation statutes like the General Clauses Act, 1897 - Purpose: Held: Are enactments intended to set standards in construction of statutes – The expression construction is of seminal importance as it is oriented towards enabling a seeker of the text of a statute to understand the true meaning of the words and their intendment – Apart from setting coherent and consistent methods of understanding enactments, the interpretation statutes also subserve the purpose of reducing prolixity of legislations – Therefore, the standard principles formulated in the interpretation statutes must be read into any and every enactment falling for consideration – Interpretation statutes or definitions in interpretation clauses are only internal aids of construction of a statute – Subordinate legislation, by its very nature, rests upon the executive’s understanding of the primary legislation – When a Court is of the opinion that such an understanding is not in consonance with the statute, it sets it aside for being ultra-vires to the primary statute. [Paras 24, 27, 28] Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 1996 – r.19 – Retroactive operation – Substituted Rule imposed lesser penalty than the repealed rule if permissible limits of loss of liquor exceeded – Plea of the respondent-State that the substituted Rule cannot be given retrospective effect: Held: Submission rejected – It is wrong to assume that the substituted Rule is given retrospective effect if its benefits are made available to pending proceedings or to those that have commenced after the substitution – r.19 which was substituted on 29.03.2011 was made applicable to proceedings that commenced with the issuance of the demand notice in November, 2011 – The Rule operates retroactively and thus saves it from arbitrarily classifying the offenders into two categories with no purpose to subserve.
