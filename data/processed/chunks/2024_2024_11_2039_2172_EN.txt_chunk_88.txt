Once a resolution plan is approved under the IBC, 2016 the Successful Resolution Applicant undertakes a profound responsibility to implement the plan in both letter and spirit. This obligation is not merely an empty formality but an enduring commitment to restore the corporate debtor to viability and ensure a meaningful turnaround. The role of a Successful Resolution Applicant is thus far more than a transactional 2166 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports duty towards the creditors or stakeholders; it embodies a pivotal responsibility to the distressed entity itself, which must be approached with utmost dedication and an earnest sense of duty. Regardless of the challenges that may arise, the Successful Resolution Applicant cannot treat its obligations as optional or conditional, nor can it abdicate its responsibility in the face of unforeseen obstacles. Its efforts must reflect a determination to implement the plan fully and to rejuvenate the debtor company, as this is integral to the success of the IBC framework and the spirit of economic revival it seeks to foster. The approach, therefore, must not be frugal or narrowly profit-driven, limited to viewing the transaction through a purely commercial lens. Instead, it must recognize that rescuing a distressed company is a responsibility of significant social and economic value, demanding a holistic and responsible strategy. This involves a dedication to long- term outcomes, where the Successful Resolution Applicant adopts measures that genuinely support the debtor’s rehabilitation, rather than making minimal or half-hearted attempts at implementation. Courts and tribunals have consistently underscored that the Successful Resolution Applicant’s role transcends commercial interest and embodies a commitment to the larger purpose of corporate revival. Consequently, it must make thoughtful and sustained efforts, demonstrating adaptability and resilience even when faced with obstacles or operational impediments. Simply put, the Successful Resolution Applicant cannot step back or dismiss its obligations by attributing delays or setbacks to the conduct of other stakeholders, as this would undermine the very purpose of insolvency resolution. 174. In this collaborative effort, the duty to implement the plan does not fall on the Successful Resolution Applicant alone; lenders and creditors are equally obligated to support the process by offering constructive and continuous cooperation. They must not impede the implementation process through unnecessary demands beyond the pale of the resolution plan or with delays in implementation plan but rather should facilitate the Successful Resolution Applicant’s efforts to revive the corporate debtor. Given their vested interest in the corporate debtor’s successful revival, lenders have a fundamental duty to act in good faith and with transparency, recognizing that their cooperative stance is essential for overcoming the inevitable challenges of the resolution process. The lender’s role is not merely passive; it requires active support that aligns with the ultimate goal [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2167 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. of the IBC, 2016 — to provide a fair and equitable resolution that maximizes asset value while enabling the debtor’s recovery. 175. Therefore, the lenders must balance their financial interests with the broader objective of rehabilitation.
