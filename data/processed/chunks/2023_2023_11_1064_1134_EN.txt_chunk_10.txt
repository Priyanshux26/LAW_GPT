To highlight this aspect in paragraph 6(c) the complainants have contended at the relevant point of time the Jantri value of the subject land was Rs.4,800/- per sq.mtr. and the consideration depicted in the Sale Deed is at Rs.8,500/-. It is also stated that consideration for the sale transaction for 118.80 sq. mtrs. of land and for the land sold to the extent of 152.00 sq. mtrs. are similar and hence the complainants contend that respondent No.4 maliciously sold the subject property at under value rate and has caused huge loss to the public exchequer. To highlight the fact that alleged possession certifi cate which has been relied upon to contend that sale transaction had already been completed way back in the year 2012 when compared to the Sale Deed dated 09.02.2016, it would clearly indicate that survey numbers depicted in both these documents are distinct and diff erent. Hence, contending that the possession receipts executed in favour of Prakash Kundu as well as cash receipts produced on record are forged, bogus and concocted and contrary to the facts, the complainants have sought for the said documents being excluded from the purview of consideration of this Court.”. (Emphasis supplied) 17. In para 36, the High Court took notice of the fact that the contemnors in categorical terms had admitted in their affi davit fi led in the proceedings, that they had sold the subject property though fully conversant and aware of the undertaking given by them before the Court that they would not sell the property till the disposal of the main petition. 18. In para 37, the High Court looked into the affi davit fi led by the accused No. 4 (power of attorney holder) dated 28.08.2018. Para 37 reads thus: 1080 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. “37. Whereas, the accused no. 4 categorically admits of execution of sale deed, however, he tries to feign ignorance by deposing in his affi davit dated 28.08.2018 to the following eff ect:- "I say that the main allegation made against us is, that contrary to the s of this Hon'ble Court dated 14.10.2015, we have sold the property to the persons who are mentioned in the indexed documents annexed with the contempt application. I say that I, bona fi de believed that, the transactions mentioned in the indexed documents on page-157 onwards alleging contempt against us, without trying to over justify the case, it is my duty to point out the correct facts which led me to bona fi de believe that sale was completed. I say that on page-158 copy of the index register is produced regarding the sale in favour of Prashantbhai Haradhanbhai Kondu, which is registered on 09.02.2016. I am producing herewith a copy of the sale deed because, the index produced by the applicant does not refl ect the correct position. Hereto and marked as Annexure R1 is copy of the sale deed dated 09.02.2016. It is very clear that the sale was completed on 21.08.2012, but it was only not registered.
