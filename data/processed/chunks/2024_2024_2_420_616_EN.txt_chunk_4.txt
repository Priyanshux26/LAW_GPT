[Paras 69, 74] Elections — Electoral Process - Electoral Bond Scheme - Infringement of the right to information of the voter, if satisfies the proportionality standard vis-a-vis the purposes of curbing black money; and protecting donor privacy: Held: (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Cul.) (for himself and for B R Gavai, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, JJ) Purpose of curbing black money is not traceable to any of the grounds in Art 19(2) — Electoral trusts are an effective alternative through which the objective of curbing black money in electoral financing can be achieved — Electoral Bond Scheme not being the least restrictive means to achieve the purpose of curbing black money in electoral process, there is no necessity of applying the balancing prong of the proportionality standard — Electoral Bond Scheme is not the only means for curbing black money in Electoral Finance — There are other alternatives which substantially fulfill the purpose and impact the right to information minimally when compared to the impact of electoral bonds on the right to information — Constitution of India — Art. 19(1) (a) and 19(2). [Paras 116, 121, 124, 129, 130] 426 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Elections — Electoral process - Right to informational privacy, if extends to financial contributions to a political party: Held : (per Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CuI.) (for himself and for B R Gavai, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, JJ) If the right to informational privacy extends to financial contributions to a political party, this Court needs to decide if the Electoral Bond Scheme adequately balances the right to information and right to informational privacy of political affiliation — Informational privacy to political affiliation is necessary to protect the freedom of political affiliation and exercise of electoral franchise — As regards, right to informational privacy if can be extended to the contributions to political parties, Electoral Bond Scheme has two manifestations of privacy, informational privacy by prescribing confidentiality vis- a-vis the political party; and informational privacy by prescribing non-disclosure of the information of political contributions to the public — Financial contributions to political parties are usually made because they may constitute an expression of support to the political party and that the contribution may be based on a quid pro quo — Law permits contributions to political parties by both corporations and individuals — Huge political contributions made by corporations and companies should not be allowed to conceal the reason for financial contributions made by another section of the population: a student, a daily wage worker, an artist, or a teacher — When the law permits political contributions and such contributions could be made as an expression of political support which would indicate the political affiliation of a person, it is the duty of the Constitution to protect them — Contributions made as quid pro quo transactions are not an expression of political support — However, to not grant the umbrella of informational privacy to political contributions only because a portion of the contributions is made for other reasons would be impermissible — Constitution does not turn a blind eye merely because of the possibilities of misuse.
