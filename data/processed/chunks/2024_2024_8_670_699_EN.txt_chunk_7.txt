In such circumstances referred to above, the appellants preferred an application under Section 482 of the CrPC in the High Court, praying for quashing of the summoning dated 28.02.2023 passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khurja, Bulandshahar. 4. The High Court rejected the application filed by the appellants herein, observing as under: “15. On the basis of averments made in the complaint, it is a case of the complainant who was regularly supplying Oats, used for horses. In the year 1995, the complainant was asked to raise invoice in favour of the ‘Association’. The complainant agreed and continued to raise invoice in favour of the ‘Association’. After 2017, an amount of Rs. 9,11,434/- became due upon the applicants. He contacted Delhi Race Club (1940) Ltd. and he was directed to contact the ‘Association’. The applicant Delhi Race Club (1940) Ltd. and ‘Association’ are not separate legal entity. The applicants and the ‘Association’ were in collusion and committed fraud with complainant. The goods supplied by complainant were received but its payment was not made. 16. Admittedly, no civil proceedings are pending for the amount in question between the parties. It is not the case of the applicants that transaction was a commercial transaction whereas the case of opposite party No. 2 is for the supply made by him. He is bound to raise his payment on the direction of the Delhi Race Club (1940) Ltd. He raised invoices in favour of the ‘Association’ from 1995. There is no change in the manner of raising invoices by the complainant. Delhi Race Club (1940) Ltd. continued to make payment upto the year 2017. The complainant was not being paid Rs. 9,11,434/- by the applicants who instead transferred their responsibility to the ‘Association’. 17. Suffice to mention here that the copies of the invoices are brought on record through counter affidavit by the complainant and the same are not controverted by the applicants. Prima facie, it reflects that the invoices were raised by complainant in accordance with the advice received by him and he continued to receive payment on 682 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the basis of such invoices and when the payment of Rs. 9,11,434/- was not paid to the complainant he contacted Delhi Race Club (1940) Ltd. which averted him to the ‘Association’.
