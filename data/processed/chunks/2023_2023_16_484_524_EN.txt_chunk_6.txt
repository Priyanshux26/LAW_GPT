The diff erence between the assessee and the revenue was with regard to the determination of the market value of electricity per unit so as to compute the income accrued to the assessee on supply made by it to its own manufacturing units. After referring to the provisions of Section 80 IA of the Act, more particularly to sub-section (8) of Section 80 IA and also upon an analysis of the meaning of the expression “market value”, Tribunal came to the conclusion that the price at which electricity was supplied by the assessee to the State Electricity Board could not be equated with the market value as understood for the purpose of Section 80 IA (8) of the Act. In this regard, Tribunal also analysed various provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 and the agreement dated 15.07.1999 entered into between the assessee and the State Electricity Board.Consequently, Tribunal was of the view that the stand of the revenue could not be approved whereafter it was held that the price recorded by the assessee at Rs.3.72 per unit was the market value for the purpose of Section 80 IA (8) of the Act. Thus, the Tribunal upheld the stand of the assessee and set aside the of CIT (A) by directing the assessing offi cer to allow relief to the assessee under Section 80 IA as claimed. 10. Aggrieved by the aforesaid fi nding rendered by the Tribunal,revenue preferred appeal before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana under Section 260 A of the Act which was registered as Income Tax Appeal No.53 of 2008. The High Court in its dated 02.09.2008 disposed of the appeal by following its dated 02.09.2008 passed in the connected ITA No.544 of 2006 (Commissioner of Income Tax, Hisar Vs. M/s Jindal Steel and Power Ltd). That was an appeal by the revenue on the same issue against COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX v. M/S JINDAL STEEL & POWER 493 LTD. THROUGH ITS MANAGING DIRECTOR [UJJAL BHUYAN, J.] the dated 31.3.2006 passed by the Tribunal in the case of the assessee itself i.e. ITA No.3663/Del/2005 for the assessment year 2000-2001. Insofar allowance of deduction under Section 80 IA of the Act is concerned, the High Court answered the question against the revenue as it was submitted at the bar that the issue already stood covered by the previous decision against the revenue. 11. Respondent assessee has fi led counter affi davit. It has contended that the only issue to be considered is whether deduction claimed by the assessee under Section 80 IA of the Act should be computed by taking Rs. 2.32 per unit being the price at which electricity was sold to the State Electricity Board as the market value of the electricity or the price of Rs. 3.72 per unit being charged by the State Electricity Board for supply of electricity to the industrial consumers including the assessee. 11.1. Assessee had claimed deduction under Section 80 IA in respect of its two undertakings engaged in generation of power at Raigarh (Chhattisgarh).
