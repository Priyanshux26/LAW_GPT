28. Learned senior counsel submit that Netherlands’ position has been clear as early as from 1998. The Dutch decree of 22.06.1998 issued by the Secretary of Finance clarifies that the MFN clause in Clause IV of Protocol is automatic; for every favourable provision as a consequence of a DTAA with another OECD country, Netherlands was of the view that the amendment would apply with eff ect from date of entry into force of that relevant convention. Similarly, the decree by Netherlands on 28.02.2012 maintained that benefi cial provision of the USA-DTAA on restricted scope of FTS should apply with eff ect from 01-04-1991 (1st April of the fi scal year following the date of entry into force of the India-USA DTAA). 29. Counsel argue that the revenue’s arguments are unfounded because even in Netherlands, a notifi cation is required for MFN benefi ts to extend to the India-Netherlands DTAA. These decrees of 1998, 1999 and 2012 have been issued by executive-decree states in to avoid ambiguity. Issuing such decrees are not akin to notifi cations statutorily required to give eff ect to automatic amendments but just represents the understanding of the Dutch authorities. Under Netherlands law to give eff ect to a DTAA, parliamentary approval under Article 91 of the Netherlands Constitution is required. The process is that it has to be signed by the government, after which it has to be approved by both houses of Parliament and then, ratifi ed.

Similar arguments were advanced in respect of French s and Swiss decrees and s, which gave eff ect to the DTAAs and Protocols. It is highlighted that the entry of the three countries: Lithuania, Slovenia, and Colombia, into OECD were duly noted in subsequent s and given eff ect to, wherever necessary. 30. Next, the assessees dealt with the argument that Lithuania, Columbia, etc. were not OECD members at the time of signing of the India- Netherlands DTAA, or the India-Switzerland Protocols in question, or the India-France DTAA and Protocol.
