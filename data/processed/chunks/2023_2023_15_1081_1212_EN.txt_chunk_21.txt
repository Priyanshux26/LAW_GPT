Section 29 indicates who the stamp duty is to be borne by (in the absence of an agreement to the contrary) and Section 30 stipulates that a receipt must be given in certain cases. 35. A person may also apply to the Collector for his opinion as to the duty (if any) which is payable on a particular instrument, under Section 31 of the Stamp Act. The instrument given to the Collector for his opinion may be executed or previously stamped, but there is no requirement that it must be either executed or previously stamped.35 If an instrument brought to the Collector under Section 31 is in their opinion chargeable with duty, and they determine that it is already fully stamped, or that the duty determined by them under Section 31 has already been paid, then they shall certify by endorsement on such instrument that the full duty with which it is chargeable has been paid.36 If the Collector is of the opinion that the instrument is not chargeable with duty, they shall certify that it is not so chargeable.37 Any instrument upon which an endorsement has been made under Section 32 shall be deemed to be duly stamped or not chargeable with duty, as the case may be.38 The proviso to Section 32 lists three categories of instruments which the Collector is not authorised to endorse under the same section. 36. Chapter IV of the Stamp Act details with the procedure to be followed by various authorities if instruments which are liable to be stamped are not duly stamped. The provisions of this Chapter are examined in detail in the subsequent segment. Chapter V provides for allowances for stamps (such as spoiled or misused stamps) in certain cases and Chapter VI provides for reference of cases arising under the enactment to authorities including the High Courts as well as for the revision of certain decisions of courts regarding the suffi ciency of stamps.
