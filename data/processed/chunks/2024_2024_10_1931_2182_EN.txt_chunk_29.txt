… The 7 Judge Bench did not also have the benefit of the reasoning in Ch. Tikaramji’s case (supra) which had held that in the absence of any notified under Section 18-G of the 1951 Act no question of repugnancy could arise, which Mr. Dwivedi urged, recognised the State’s power to legislate with regard to matters under Entry 33 of List III notwithstanding the provisions and existence of Section 18-G in the 1951 Act. 55 Form FL 41 is meant for those industries where alcohol is used as a solvent but some alcohol continues to remain in final products such as lacquers, varnish, polishes, adhesives, anti-freezers and brake fluids. 56 2004 SCC OnLine All 159. 57 [2007] 11 SCR 670 : (2007) 13 SCC 463 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1971 State of U.P. & Ors. v.

Tikaramji’s case (supra) explained and distinguished the decision of the 7 Judge Bench in Synthetics and Chemicals case (supra). […] 28. Yet another case referred to by Mr. Dwivedi was the decision of a Constitution Bench of 5 Judges of this Court in Belsund Sugar v. State of Bihar (1999) 9 SCC 620 […]. In the said case also it was observed by the Constitution Bench that in the absence of promulgation of any statutory covering the filed under Section 18-G it could not be said that mere existence of a statutory provision for entrustment of such power would result in regulation of purchase and sale of flour even if it is a scheduled industry. It may be noted that even while noting the decision of the 7 Judge Bench in Synthetics and Chemicals case (supra) the Court placed reliance on the decision rendered in the SIEL Ltd. Case (supra). … 35. On consideration of the aforesaid submissions made on behalf of the respective parties, we are of the view that Mr. Dwivedi’s submissions have a good deal of force, since by virtue of the interpretation of Section 18-G in the Synthetics and Chemicals case (supra) the power of the State to legislate with matters relating to Entry 33 of List III have been ousted, except to the extent as explained in the Synthetics and Chemicals case in paragraphs 63-64 of the , where the State’s power to regulate, as far as regulating the use of alcohol, which would include the power to make provisions to prevent and/ or check industrial alcohol being used as intoxicant liquor, had been accepted. … As submitted by Mr. Dwivedi, the 7 Judge Bench did not have the benefit of the views expressed by this Court earlier in Ch. Tikaramji case (supra) where the State’s power to legislate under the Concurrent List stood ousted by legislation by the Central Government under Entry 52 of List I and also 1972 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
