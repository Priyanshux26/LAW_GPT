561 Nara Chandrababu Naidu v. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr. lapses in relation to collaboration of APSSDC/AP Government with Design Tech. It appears that there was a previous communication in this regard dated 09.02.2021. Even though reference is made to the letter of 05.06.2018 in this communication, there are no specific particulars of such enquiry or the date on which such enquiry was started. There are subsequent letters dated 22.02.2021, 30.03.2021, 23.06.2021 and 18.08.2021, all referring to the letter of 05.06.2018. But as it has been already observed earlier, there are no specific particulars regarding when and in what form the enquiry has started. There obviously was a time gap between the date of issue of the letter of 05.06.20218 and actual date on which the enquiry was commenced. The State has justified this delay in its counter affidavit. It has been stated that instead of acting on the letter of the taxing authorities dated 14.05.2018, which in turn has been referred to in the communication of 05.06.2018, the note file pertaining to the project was removed by the appellant from the secretariate in collaboration with other accused persons and this was done to temper with evidence and to ensure that the offences were not brought to light. This act of removal of file may constitute a or an independent offence. But if otherwise no enquiry was started because of such alleged wrong, this time gap cannot be treated to have caused the date of issue of the letter of 05.06.2018 to be starting point of an enquiry, in the nature contemplated in Section 17A of the 1988 Act. 12. Section 17A thereof postulates prior approval from the appointing authority in relation to any enquiry, inquiry, or investigation under the 1988 Act. While the expression “inquiry” has been defined in the 1973 code, there is no specific definition of the word “enquiry”. The Concise Oxford English Law Dictionary, Revised Tenth Edition, defines the said expression as “an act of asking for an information”. It entails commencement of an active search to ascertain the truth or falsity of an alleged wrongful act. 13. In ordinary perception, “enquiry” by a police officer would imply positive exercise for searching certain details or particulars pertaining to allegations of commission of an offence by an accused persons or a set of accused persons. “Inquiry” is defined in Section 2 (g) of the 1973 and implies inquiry conducted under the Code by a Magistrate or Court. Similarly, “investigation” in terms of Section 2 (h) of the same Code includes all the proceedings conducted thereunder for 562 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports collection of evidence by a police officer or a person authorised by a Magistrate in that behalf. The nature of actions undertaken by the State after 05.06.1988 constitutes neither inquiry nor investigation, as no step under the 1973 Code was taken by the State prior to the year 2021. If that is the meaning attributed to this expression, the letter of 05.06.2018 or the earlier letter from taxing authority dated 14.05.2018 cannot be construed to be the commencing point of any enquiry.
