(f) there is a discrepancy as to when the police recorded the statement of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) and his version of events on 13.06.1998 and 14.06.1998. Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) claims that after the occurrence he and Rama Devi (PW-24) had proceeded to the official residence of Brij Bihari Prasad from IGIMS hospital at about 9:00-9:30 p.m. Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) had left for Muzzaffarpur Math in the night at about 12:30 a.m. on 14.06.1998. Thus, the police could not have recorded the statement of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) in the IGIMS hospital at 12:30 a.m. on 14.06.1998. Further, if Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) was present at the time of occurrence, as deposed by him, police should have recorded his statement before he left the IGIMS hospital campus around 9:30 p.m. (v) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) was not an eye-witness, as his presence is not mentioned in the fardbeyan (Exhibit 50) or the FIR (Exhibits 51 and 51/1). His statement under Section 161 of the CrPC was recorded belatedly, five days after the incident. (vi) Rama Devi (PW-24) is not an eye-witness, as she had left the place of occurrence prior to the incident. The police did not produce Rama Devi’s statement under Section 161 of the CrPC recorded on 13.06.1998 by the second investigating officer11 – 11 For short, “IO”. 1322 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54), who had taken charge of the investigation in compliance with the instructions of Senior Superintendent of Police, Patna. The version of Rama Devi (PW-24) that she learnt names and details of the assailants from the visitors she had met earlier in the day in the hospital room is not mentioned in the Section 161 CrPC statements dated 18.10.1999 and 28.03.2001 given by her to Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of CBI. This is corroborated by the statement of Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of CBI, who testified that Rama Devi (PW-24) did not name the assailants. Since the initial statement of Rama Devi (PW-24) under Section 161 CrPC recorded by Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) was not on record and she later failed to disclose the name of the assailants in her Section 161 CrPC statements to Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of CBI, her deposition in court, stating that Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Kamakhya Narain Singh (PW-15), Arbind Singh (PW-13), Amarendra Kumar Sinha (Informant/PW-10), Onkar Singh, Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and others were present with the deceased, should not be relied on. (vii) The eye-witnesses did not testify about the retaliatory firing by the security personnel of Brij Bihari Prasad who were present at the scene of the occurrence. The recovery of empty cartridges and the firearms examination report (Exhibit-17) indicate that shots were fired from two of the four rifles which had been issued to the security guards. Court depositions and analysis of evidence 9. We will now examine in some detail the court depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Amarendra Kumar Singh (PW-10) and Rama Devi (PW-24), before scrutinising the reasons given by the High Court to discredit their versions.
