However, it is open to it to issue instructions to fill up the gaps and supplement the rules where they are silent on any particular point.22 Such instructions have a binding force provided they are subservient to the statutory provisions and have been issued to fill up the gaps between the statutory provisions.23 51. In K H Siraj v. High Court of Kerala,24 this Court was called upon to determine the validity of the decision of the High Court of Kerala in prescribing minimum marks for the oral examination as a condition of eligibility for selection as Munsif Magistrate. The relevant provision, that is, Rule 7 of the Kerala Judicial Service Rules 1991, mandated the High Court to hold written and oral examinations and prepare a list of candidates considered suitable for appointment to Category 2 posts. This Court held that even though Rule 7 was silent on the question of minimum marks for oral examination, it was open to the High Court to supplement the Rule: “62. Thus it is seen that apart from the amplitude of the power under Rule 7 it is clearly open for the High Court to prescribe benchmarks for the written test and oral test in to achieve the purpose of getting the best available talent. There is nothing in the Rules barring such a procedure from being adopted. It may also be mentioned that executive instructions can always supplement the Rules which may not deal with every aspect of a matter. Even assuming that Rule 7 did not prescribe any particular minimum, it was open to the High Court to supplement the 22 Sant Ram Sharma v. State of Rajasthan, [1968] 1 SCR 111 : 1967 SCC OnLine SC 16 [7]; State of Gujarat v Akhilesh C Bhargav, [1987] 3 SCR 1091 : (1987) 4 SCC 482, [7] 23 State of Uttar Pradesh v. Chandra Mohan Nigam, [1978] 1 SCR 521 : (1977) 4 SCC 345 [26]; 24 [2006] Supp. 2 SCR 790 : (2006) 6 SCC 395 1168 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports rule with a view to implement them by prescribing relevant standards in the advertisement for selection.” 52. In the present case, the Rules are silent in regard to the manner in which the merit or suitability would be determined. In view of the silence of the Rules, it is open to the High Court in the exercise of its administrative authority to provide the modalities in which merit or suitability would be determined. iii. Sivanandan C T 53. Next, it would become necessary to dwell on a recent decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Sivanandan C T (supra). The issue in that case pertained to the validity of the selection process to the Higher Judicial Services through direct recruitment conducted by the High Court of Kerala. The Kerala State Higher Judicial Services Rules 1961 stipulated that the direct recruitment from the Bar shall be “on the basis of aggregate marks/grade obtained in a competitive examination and viva voce conducted by the High Court.” Thereafter in 2012, the High Court of Kerala published its Scheme for the examination for recruitment of members of the Bar to the Kerala Higher Judicial Service.
