The OSD passed an under Section 53(3) of the RUI Act for settlement of compensation at Rs. 90,000/- in lieu of the acquisition of the Nangli Kota lands. However, the payment of compensation was delayed as the Registrar, Board of Revenue informed the appellant Trust of the ongoing litigation in respect of the nature and ownership of the Survey no. 229 which formed part of the Nangli Kota lands. 64. The respondents on the other hand, averred that the agreement to receive Rs. 90,000/- in lieu of the Nangli Kota lands was not signed by the designated official of the Government and therefore, does not constitute a binding agreement for the determination of compensation. However, from the records placed forth by the parties, we are inclined to reject this contention as the of the OSD settling compensation amount at Rs. 90,000/- was sufficient acceptance of the agreement sent by the respondents, in our view. 65. As regards the delay in payment of compensation, it is apposite to state that the parallel litigation regarding the nature and ownership of land bearing Survey no. 229 concluded after the said land was mutated in the name of the respondents on 20.03.1985 after the Board of Revenue, Ajmer held on 30.12.1983 that the said land was ‘abadi land’ and belonged to the respondents and not the State Government. The appellant Trust has filed a writ petition against the mutation of the lands in the name of the respondents as the land was already previously mutated in its name in 1981. However, it is pertinent to mention that the appellant Trust did not challenge the Board of Revenue’s decision on the nature of the land. 1032 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 66. We find at least two inconsistencies in the payment of compensation to the respondents and the procedure of acquisition of the Nangli Kota lands: • As per Section 52(7), the possession of the land being acquired cannot be handed over to the appellant Trust till it deposits the compensation amount determined under Section 53 of the RUI Act. However, in the present case, the possession of the Nangli Kota lands was handed over to the appellant Trust long before it deposited the compensation amount with the reference court. • Even though the parallel litigation on the questions of nature and ownership of the land bearing Survey no. 229 was concluded in 1985, the compensation amount was deposited by the appellant Trust in the reference court only on 31.12.1997 that is after 12 years. 67. After the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was extended to the State of Rajasthan on 24.09.1984, an amendment in the RUI Act was introduced vide the Amending Act, 1987 which provided for the transitory measures for facilitating the application of the Land Acquisition Act to the State of Rajasthan. The legislature enacted Section 60A with a view to address the pending acquisition proceedings which were initiated under the RUI Act. The transitory provision of Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act, 1959 is reproduced hereunder: “60A.
