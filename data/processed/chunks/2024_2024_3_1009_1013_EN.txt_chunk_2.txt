Vs. Pranay Sethi and Other6 has also been referred to in Sube Singh (supra) on the aspect of calculation of the multiplier applicable in such a case. A recent decision in the case of Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Limited Vs. Mandala Yadagari Goud and Others7 has reiterated the same position as observed in the cases cited above. We are, therefore, of the opinion that it is the age of the deceased which ought to be taken into consideration and not the age of the dependents for arriving at the multiplier and the High Court has erred in returning findings to the effect that the age of dependents of the deceased ought to be the relevant consideration for arriving at the choice of the multiplier. 6. Accordingly, the impugned dated 19th October, 2016, in Civil Appeal @ Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13093 of 2017, in respect of FAO No. 756 of 2016 is quashed and set aside and the judgement dated 10th July, 2015, passed by the learned MACT fixing the multiplier of 18 in the instant case is restored. The respondent–Insurance Company is directed to pay the balance amount along with up-to-date interest after adjusting the amounts already paid to the appellants. The said amount shall be deposited with the MACT within six weeks. 7. Similarly, the impugned dated 10th January, 2017 in Civil Appeal @ Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13072 of 2017 in respect of First Appeal No. 50 of 2016 is modified to the extent that the multiplier shall be applied as assessed by the MACT as 17. The MACT shall recalculate the amount payable by the respondent no.2-Insurance Company to the appellants by replacing 4 [2013] 2 SCR 706 : (2013) 9 SCC 65 5 [2009] 5 SCR 1098 : (2009) 6 SCC 121 6 [2017] 13 SCR 100 : (2017) 16 SCC 680 7 [2019] 6 S.C.R. 941 : (2019) 5 SCC 554 [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1013 Haresh Shantilal Avlani & Anr. v. The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. the multiplier from 13 to 17. After adjusting the amount already paid by the respondents the balance amount shall be deposited by the respondent no.2-Insurance Company within six weeks. 8. The appeals are allowed and disposed of on the above terms. Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case: Appeals disposed of.
