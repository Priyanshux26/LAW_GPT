In the meantime, an Interlocutory Application95 was filed by the respondent for disposing the petition on the ground that it had become infructuous. The appellant in the reply affidavit has contested the IA on the ground that even though the principal amount of Rs 83 lakhs has been paid towards arrears, interest charges to the tune of approximately Rs 2 crore on the principal amount are still to be recovered. F 230. Since the respondent applied for electricity connection on 17 June 2005, the Maharashtra Electricity Supply Code 2005, which came into force from 20 January 2005, is applicable in the instant case. Accordingly, a charge was created on the electricity arrears in terms of Regulation 10.5.
