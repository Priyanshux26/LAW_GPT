152. Recently, this Court, in the case of Central Warehousing Corporation v. Adani Ports Special Economic Zone Limited C (APSEZL) and others12, has deprecated the practice of different instrumentalities of the State taking contradictory/different positions/ stands on the same issue. 153. In the present case, the learned APTEL has also held that SHR and GCV has to be taken into consideration as per the ‘actual’ or D the Tariff Regulations, whichever is lower and as such, balanced the interests of generators as well as consumers. 154. That leaves us to deal with the additional point raised in the case of GMR (i.e. Civil Appeal No.6927 of 2021). E 155. The CERC, apart from its finding on SHR and GCV, has also directed late payment surcharge to be paid. The same has been affirmed by the learned APTEL. The CERC as well as the learned APTEL, on the interpretation of Articles 8.3.5 and 8.8.3 of the PPA, have concurrently found that the procurer had delayed the payment by not making the payment within the due date and, as such, GMR was F entitled to late payment surcharge. We find no reason to interfere with the said concurrent findings of fact. 156. We, therefore, find no merit in the appeals. The appeals are dismissed. There shall be no as to costs. Pending application, if any, shall stand disposed of. G Bibhuti Bhushan Bose Appeals dismissed. (Assisted by : Pranjal Singh and Rahul Rathi, LCRAs) 12 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1398 H
