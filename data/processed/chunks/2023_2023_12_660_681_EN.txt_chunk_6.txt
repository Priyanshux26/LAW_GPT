The words “or of the Royal Indian Marine Service” were omitted by A.O. 1937. Likewise, the words “His Majesty’s naval, military or air forces” were replaced by the words “the Armed Forces of the Union” by A.O. 1950. (Emphasis supplied) 24. The aforesaid clause (n) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 1923 Act was omitted by Act No.45 of 2009, with eff ect from 18.01.2010, as by Act No.45 of 2009 the name of “The Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923” was changed to “The Employee’s Compensation Act, 1923”. Consequent to the change in nomenclature of the Act, clause (n) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 was omitted and clause (dd), defi ning an employee, was inserted in sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 1923 Act. Clause (dd) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 1923 Act reads as under: - “(dd) “employee” means a person, who is— 670 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. (i) a railway servant as defi ned in clause (34) of section 2 of the Railways Act, 1989 (24 of 1989), not permanently employed in any administrative district or sub-divisional offi ce of a railway and not employed in any such capacity as is specifi ed in Schedule II; or (ii) (a) a master, seaman or other member of the crew of a ship, (b) a captain or other member of the crew of an aircraft, (c) a person recruited as driver, helper, mechanic, cleaner or in any other capacity in connection with a motor vehicle, (d) a person recruited for work abroad by a company, and who is employed outside India in any such capacity as is specified in Schedule II and the ship, aircraft or motor vehicle, or company, as the case may be, is registered in India; or (iii) employed in any such capacity as is specifi ed in Schedule II, whether the contract of employment was made before or after the passing of this Act and whether such contract is expressed or implied, oral or in writing; but does not include any person working in the capacity of a member of the Armed Forces of the Union; and any reference to any employee who has been injured shall, where the employee is dead, include a reference to his dependants or any of them;” 25. As we notice that various sub clauses of clause (n) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 1923 Act refer to Schedule II, a look at the relevant Entries in Schedule II, which deals with Railways, would be apposite to have a clear understanding of the true import of the provisions of clause (n) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 1923 Act. 26. At this stage, we may observe that the learned counsel for the appellant has pointed out three entries in Schedule II which are referable to railways. These are Entry Nos. (i), (xii) and (xiii). These entries in Schedule II, as it stood prior to the amendment brought about by Act No.45 of 2009, along with the opening part of Schedule II are extracted below: COMMANDING OFFICER, RAILWAY PROTECTION SPECIAL FORCE, 671 MUMBAI v.
