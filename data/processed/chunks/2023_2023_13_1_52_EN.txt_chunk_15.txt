No.4364 of 2011 made the following submissions: 13.1. After referring to the question referred to the Constitution Bench, Shri Datar, learned Senior Advocate submitted that following three corollary questions also arise for consideration namely: (i) Whether declaration of a law being violative of Article 14 or any other Article contained in Part-III is void ab initio under Article 13(2)? 43 (1997) 5 SCC 201 44 494 US 827 (1990) 45 Civil Appeal No.5815 of 2009 by Supreme Court of India vide dated 06.09.2021 CBI v. R.R. KISHORE 23 [VIKRAM NATH, J.] (ii) What is the eff ect of such a on actions taken or omitted to be taken during the period when the law remained operational? and (iii) Whether there is a difference between: (I) a law held as unconstitutional for lack of legislative competence; and (II) a law held to be unconstitutional for violation of Part-III or other constitutional limitations? 13.2. Referring to Article 20(1) of the Constitution vis-a-vis deprivation of immunity retrospectively and analysing the said constitutional provision, it is submitted that a conviction of an accused can take place by following the prescribed procedure starting from enquiry, investigation, trial etc. According to him, if the fi rst stages of enquiry, investigation are not permitted unless there is a specifi ed prior approval as there is immunity from prosecution, no conviction can take place. According to him, this immunity referring to Section 6A of the DSPE Act, is entitled to protection under Article 20(1) of the Constitution. According to him, the marginal note refers to protection in respect of conviction and the phrase ‘in respect of’ must be interpreted to grant protection to all the existing procedural safeguards at the time when the off ence was alleged to be committed. Reliance was placed upon a of this Court in the case of Prabhu Dayal Deorah Vs. District Magistrate46. 13.3. Section 6A(1) of the DSPE Act creates an immunity and grants a protection. It cannot be taken away retrospectively, either by retrospective amendment or by a declaring such immunity invalid. 13.4. Section 6A was declared ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution and, as such, under Article 13(2) of the Constitution it is void to the extent of the contravention. The argument further proceeds to elaborate the meaning and scope of the word “void” which came up for consideration in a number of cases right from 1951 to 1963. Dr. Datar has very fairly submitted that this Court has held that a provision which is held to be ‘void’ would be a “nullity”, “still born” or “dead” as if it was never in existence at all. 13.5 It was next submitted that a law which has been declared to be unconstitutional could only mean that such law becomes inoperative or 46 (1994) 1 SCC 103 24 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. ineff ective, once declared and not before that. The submission is that a law declared unconstitutional cannot be treated as void ab initio for the following reasons: (a) As there is a presumption of constitutionality till a law is declared to contravene the provisions of Part-III or other constitutional limitations, it remains valid; (b) The expression “to the extent of contravention” implies that there has to be a judicial declaration of contravention and the extent thereof.
