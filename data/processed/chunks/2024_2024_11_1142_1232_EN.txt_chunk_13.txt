P-1 @ Pg. 37 ( PDF Pg. 66 of Petition) (hereinafter referred to as “Distributor Agreement”) [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1163 M/s Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/s Micromax Informatics Fze 2. Moreover, admittedly, both the Petitioner (an entity of Afghanistan) and the Respondent, M/s. Micromax Informatics FZE(UAE) (an entity of UAE) are body corporates incorporated, registered and situated outside India (Please see description of Parties, Ann. P-1 @Pg.37 (PDF Pg. 66) & 50 (PDF Pg. 79) of Petition) and the Distributor Agreement admittedly was entered and executed between the parties outside India. 3. The Territory defined under the Distributor Agreement is Afghanistan (Please see Ann. P1 Clause 1 -Territory @Pg.50 (PDF Pg. 66) read with the Schedule @ PDF Pg. 79 of Petition). All business transactions are outside India. 4. Clause 26 (Distributor Agreement, Ann. P-1 @ Pg. 49 (Pdf Pg. 78 of Petition) of the Distributor Agreement provides for dispute resolution at Dubai, UAE under UAE Arbitration and Conciliation rules. 5. Clause 27 of the Distributor Agreement (Ann. P-1, @Pg. 49 (Pdf Pg. 78 of Petition) specifically provides that governing law to be exclusively of UAE. 6. There is clear intent between the parties that Dubai shall be the seat of Arbitration and the venue in the present case has to be construed as seat of arbitration. 7. Section 2 (2) of the Act with respect to the applicability of Part-1 stipulate that Section 11 of the Act has no application to arbitrations seated outside India. Thus, this a an arbitration seated outside India and Part-1 of the Act would have no applicability. 8. An “International Commercial Arbitration” in terms of Section 2(f) to attract the applicability of Section 11 for exercise of power of appointment of Arbitrator by this Hon’ble Court mandates that at least one party should be an individual or a body corporate in India and the 1164 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports arbitration agreement should compulsorily provide for seat of Arbitration in India. Admittedly neither of the Parties are individuals or body corporates in India nor the Distributor Agreement provides for arbitration seat in India. 9. Reliance is placed on the two Judgements of this Hon’ble Court: i. “Mankatsu Impex Private Limited Vs. Airvisual Ltd. (2020) 5 SCC 399”; relevant Paras being Para 20 at Page 406; Para 25 at Page 408 and Para 26 and Para 27 at Page 409 and ii. “BGS SGS Soma JV Vs. NHPC Limited (2020) 4 SCC 234”; relevant Paras being Paras 61, 62 and 67 at are Page 242). 10. It is further submitted that the use of “non-exclusive jurisdiction of Dubai Courts” in Distributor Agreement did not ever envisage jurisdiction of Courts outside UAE and in no manner whatsoever the “Courts of India”. The word “non-exclusive: has been used in the context that jurisdiction of other Courts in UAE may not be restricted. 11. Invoking of the provisions under section 11 of the Act; would tantamount to re-writing the terms of the Distributor Agreement and taking away parties’ autonomy which is the sole principle on which arbitration is based.
