As regards the interpretation of clause (3) of Article 226 of the Constitution of India, various High Courts have taken different views on the issue of whether the provision for automatic vacation of stay is mandatory or directory. He urged that the provision will have to be held as a directory; 7 [2005] 3 SCR 289 : (2005) 4 SCC 480 8 [1983] 1 SCR 1000 : (1983) 1 SCC 147 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 963 High Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors. b. In Asian Resurfacing1, the Court was dealing with a petition filed in the High Court arising from a prosecution under the PC Act. The cases of other categories were not the subject matter of challenge before this Court; c. The power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India can be exercised for doing complete justice in any case or matter pending before it. The issue of the duration of the of stay did not arise in the case of Asian Resurfacing1; and d. A successful litigant whose application for stay is allowed by the High Court cannot be prejudiced only on the ground that the High Court does not hear the main case within six months for reasons beyond the control of the said litigant. 10. Shri Amit Pai, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant in one of the appeals, while adopting the submissions, relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Deoraj v. State of Maharashtra & Ors.9 and contended that recourse is taken to the of grant of interim relief as the conclusion of hearing on merits is likely to take some time. He submitted that the said object has not been considered in Asian Resurfacing1. He urged that passing an interim of stay is a judicial act. Therefore, such an must be vacated only by a judicial act. 11. Prof (Dr) Pankaj K Phadnis, representing the intervenor – Abhinav Bharat Congress, has filed written submissions. He has contended that he was not permitted to join the hearing through video conferencing. He has come out with the draft of Supreme Court Rules, 2024. His submissions, based on the draft, are entirely irrelevant. C. ANALYSIS 12. We have no manner of doubt that the direction issued in paragraph 36 of Asian Resurfacing1 regarding automatic vacation of stay has been issued in the exercise of the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Even the direction in paragraph 37 of conducting day-to-day hearing has been issued in exercise of the same jurisdiction. The effect of the direction issued in paragraph 36 is that the interim of stay granted 9 [2004] 3 SCR 920 : (2004) 4 SCC 697 964 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in favour of a litigant stands vacated without even giving him an opportunity of being heard, though there may not be any default on his part. I. Object of passing interim s 13. Before we examine the questions, we need to advert to the object of passing s of interim relief pending the final disposal of the main case.
