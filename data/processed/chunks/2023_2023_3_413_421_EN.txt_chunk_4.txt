But Section 10 of the Kerala G MSME Act not only confers overriding effect to the Act on other laws, but also makes a specific reference to the Act of 1994. Section 10 of the Kerala MSME Act reads as follows: “10. Overriding effect of this Act on other laws.— (1) The provisions of this Act shall have overriding effect, notwithstanding H JOLLY GEORGE AND ANR. v. GEORGE ELIAS AND 419 ASSOCIATES AND ORS. [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law, for the A time being in force. (2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions of this Act, such provisions shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in the following enactments and the provisions of these enactments shall B be read as amended in conformity with the provisions of this Act, namely:— 1. The Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 (13 of 1994) 2. The Kerala Municipality Act, 1994 (20 of 1994) C 3. The Kerala Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1960 (34 of 1960) 4. The Kerala Lift and Escalators Act, 2013 (18 of 2013) 5. Travancore - Cochin Public Health Act, 1955 (XVI of 1955) D 6. Madras Public Health Act, 1939 (3 of 1939)” 11. Therefore, the prayer made by the writ petitioners in their second writ petition, deserved to be granted, clearly in the light of the statutory prescription. But unfortunately, both the learned Single E Judge and the Division Bench completely overlooked this most vital aspect. 12. However, Shri K. Parameshwar, learned counsel appearing for the objectors contended that two issues arise for consideration namely (i) whether a self-certification obtained by respondent No.1 under the F Kerala MSME Act is sufficient in itself to set up a Hot Mix Plant; and (ii) whether in the light of such self-certification, no permission from the Panchayat is required under the Act of 1994 and Rules of 2019. 13. According to the learned counsel for the objectors, Rule 3 of the Kerala Micro Small Medium Enterprises Facilitation Rules, 2020, G requires all persons seeking Acknowledgment Certificate under Section 5(3) to furnish a duly filled self-certification in Form-I. This form contains an undertaking from the applicant to comply with the Kerala Panchayat Building Rules, 2019 and hence it is contended that the writ petitioners cannot avoid the requirement of permission from the local Panchayat. H 420 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A 14. But the said argument cannot be sustained for the simple reason that the Rules framed under the Act cannot annul the effect of the statutory provisions. Section 10(2) of the Kerala MSME Act makes it clear that the provisions of the Act of 1994, shall be read as amended to be in conformity with the provisions of the Kerala MSME Act. Therefore, the objectors cannot fall back upon the Rules to nullify the effect of the B provisions of the Act. 15. It is contended by Shri K. Parameshwar, learned counsel that though his clients have not challenged the constitutional validity of Section 10 of the Kerala MSME Act, this Court can read down the overriding and absolute clauses in public interest.
