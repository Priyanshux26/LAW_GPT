It must be acknowledged that these women who succeed in occupying such public offices, do so only after significant struggle. 11. In this vein, the concerned authorities need to sensitize themselves and work towards creating a more congenial atmosphere where women, such as the appellant, can prove their worth by rendering their services as Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat. 12. In our considered view, the nature of allegations and the consequential punishment awarded to the appellant, namely, her removal from the office of Sarpanch, is highly disproportionate. 13. For the reasons afore-stated, the appeal is allowed. The impugned dated 03.08.2023 passed by the High Court is set aside. The appellant, in whose favour stay had already been granted, shall be allowed to continue and perform the duties of Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat till the completion of her tenure. 14. ed accordingly. Result of the Case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
