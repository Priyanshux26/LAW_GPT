Part B of Section II of the First Schedule to the Rules specifi cally stated as follows: “XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX “Sl.

The scales indicated, under the First schedule are in the form of merger of four pay scales- Rs.4500-7000/-; Rs.5000-8000/-; Rs.5500-9000/- and Rs.6500-10,500/-. All are merged into one pay scale, i.e., Rs.9300- 34800/-. The Rules, as well as the Sixth CPC recommendations specifi cally talk of continuation of pay benefi ts on the basis of “historical parity”. As observed earlier, this historical parity is not denied; however, the explanation for denial of the benefi t of upgradation – and the consequent placement in higher pay scales, to employees in Ordnance Factories is that OFB employees are not specifi cally mentioned, as opposed to mention of other non-secretariat employees: “like AFHQSS/AFHQSSS/RBSS and Ministerial/Secretarial posts in Ministries/ Departments organizations like MEA, Ministry of Parliamentary Aff airs, CVC, UPSC, etc.” This argument is both unpersuasive and specious, because mention of specifi c department was meant only by way of illustration; else a contrary intention would have been clearer. That the mention of some, not all non-secretariat employees is illustrative and not exhaustive is clear from the qualifying terms – “like” and “etc.” The allusion to historical parity with reference to only a few illustrations was to encompass all those organizations where employees had identical pay scales and not merely those in enumerated departments or organizations. Any other interpretation would negate the whole intention of maintaining historical parity altogether. 866 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. 21. The other submission of the respondents was that employees in Ordnance Factories were not working in Headquarters based organizations.
