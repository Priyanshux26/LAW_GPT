No hard-and-fast law can be laid down therefor. The conduct of the parties in this behalf would also assume significance.” 16. In Saradamani Kandappan vs. S. Rajalakshmi & Ors.7, this Court held that every suit for specific performance need not be decreed merely because it is filed within the period of limitation by ignoring time limits stipulated in the agreement. The courts will also frown upon suits which are not filed immediately after the breach/ refusal. The fact that limitation is three years does not mean that a purchaser can wait for one or two years to file a suit and obtain specific performance. 17. In Atma Ram vs. Charanjit Singh8, this Court has observed in para 9 thus: “9. ……..No explanation was forthcoming from the petitioner for the long delay of three years, in filing the suit (on 13-10-1999) after issuing a legal notice on 12- 11-1996. The conduct of a plaintiff is very crucial in a suit for specific performance. A person who issues a legal notice on 12-11-1996 claiming readiness and willingness, but who institutes a suit only on 13-10-1999 and that too only with a prayer for a mandatory injunction carrying a fixed court fee relatable only to the said relief, will not be entitled to the discretionary relief of specific performance.” 6 [2009] 2 SCR 537 : (2009) 17 SCC 27 7 [2011] 8 SCR 874 : (2011) 12 SCC 18 8 [2020] 3 SCR 697 : (2020) 3 SCC 311 628 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 18. In the case in hand, the plaintiff entered into an agreement with only one of the co-owners and thereafter sought extensions for execution of the sale deed but did not prefer any suit though he was aware of the sale deed dated 14.05.1997 executed in favour of defendant nos. 12 to 14 and sent a legal notice on 30.05.1997 and even objected to the subsequent purchasers’ application for mutation of their names in the revenue records on 20.08.1997 and refers to a meeting of the Gram Panchayat dated 06.12.1997, yet the suit was preferred, on 09.05.2000 on the last date of limitation. Thus, on the strength of observations made by this Court in K.S. Vidyanadam (supra), Azhar Sultana (supra), Saradamani Kandappan (supra) & Atma Ram (supra), the suit having been preferred after a long delay, the plaintiff is not entitled for specific performance on this ground also. 19. For the foregoing, we uphold the and decree dated 01.09.2016 passed in FA No. 340 of 2003 by the High Court. The appeal lacks substance and is hereby dismissed. The parties shall bear their own costs. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
