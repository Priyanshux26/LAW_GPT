[2023] 1 S.C.R. 1079 1079 K. L. SUNEJA & ANR. A v. DR. (MRS.) MANJEET KAUR MONGA (D) THROUGH HER LR & ANR. (Civil Appeal No(s). 1401 of 2019) B JANUARY 31, 2023 [M. R. SHAH AND S. RAVINDRA BHAT, JJ.] Competition Act, 2002 – Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Payment of C interest on instalments towards allotment of a flat under construction which was ultimately cancelled – Competition Appellate Tribunal (“COMPAT”) held that complainant eligible for interest of 15% p.a. from 1st May 2005 (when allotment was cancelled) to 7th May 2016 (when pay was revalidated and cumulative instalment amount was credited to the account of the complainant) – Builder argued D that complainant had filed ‘original’ pay (issued in 2005) before the COMPAT, and not intimated builder, hence amount was deducted from builder’s account in 2005 itself, and never credited back – Impleaded Citibank averred that this contention was correct, and submitted that the amount was credited to the ‘Unclaimed Sundry E Amount’ as instructed by Reserve Bank of India, where it remained for the eleven years in question – Builder thus contended that it had discharged its liability under XXI of the CPC. Dismissing the complainant’s appeal, the Court HELD: 1.The provisions of XXI are applicable to F decrees of civil court. However, they embody a sound policy principle, that if the amount is deposited, or paid to the decree holder or person entitled to it, the person entitled to the amount cannot later seek interest on it. This is a rule of prudence, inasmuch as the debtor, or person required to pay or refund the G amount, is under an obligation to ensure that the amount payable is placed at the disposal of the person entitled to receive it. Once that is complete (in the form of payment, through different modes, including tendering a Banker’s Cheque, or Pay or Demand Draft, all of which require the account holder / debtor to pay the H 1079 1080 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A bank, which would then issue the instrument) the tender, or ‘payment’ is complete. [Para 31][1096-C-E] 2. In the present case, the complainant was aware that the Pay had been tendered by the developer to her; nevertheless she filed the original Pay with her complaint, B and did not seek any from the MRTP Commission at the relevant time. The pleadings in the complaint did not disclose that the Pay was filed in the Commission, to enable the developer to respond appropriately. In these circumstances, the developer’s argument that the rule embodied in XXI, Rule 4 CPC, is applicable, is merited. The developer cannot be C fastened with any legal liability to pay interest on the sum of ¹ 4,53,750/- after 30th April 2005. [Para 32][1096-E-G] 3.This court is also of the opinion that the complainant’s argument that on account of the omission of the developer, she was wronged, and was thus entitled to receive interest, cannot D prevail.
