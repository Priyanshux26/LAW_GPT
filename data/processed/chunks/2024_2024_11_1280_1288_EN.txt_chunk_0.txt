[2024] 11 S.C.R. 1280 : 2024 INSC 932 State of Madhya Pradesh v. Ramkumar Choudhary (Special Leave Petition (C) No. 48636 of 2024) 29 November 2024 [J.B. Pardiwala and R. Mahadevan, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Appellant-State challenged the High Court dismissing the second appeal filed with an inordinate delay of 5 years holding that the delay was not explained satisfactorily. Headnotes† Delay – Refusal to condone – When justified – Delay of 5 years in filing the second appeal by the appellant-State – Not condoned by High Court, appeal dismissed – Challenged: Held: High Court rightly refused to condone the delay – Enormous delay occurred at every stage, from the date of receipt of the passed by the First Appellate Court till the date of filing the second appeal by the State – When a case is filed beyond limitation, the petitioner has to explain the Court as to what was the “sufficient cause” which means an adequate and enough reason which prevented him to approach the Court within limitation – While a party is entitled to wait until the last day of limitation for filing an appeal but when it allows the limitation to expire and pleads sufficient cause for not filing the appeal earlier, the sufficient cause must establish that because of some event or circumstance arising before the limitation expired it was not possible to file the appeal within time – No event or circumstance arising after the expiry of limitation can constitute such sufficient cause – Enormous delay of 1788 days in filing the second appeal was not explained satisfactorily, no sufficient cause was shown for the same, and no plausible reason was put forth by the State – Petition dismissed, costs of Rs.1,00,000/- imposed on the State. [Paras 4, 5, 7, 8] Delay – In filing petitions/appeals/applications – Callous, lackadaisical attitude of Government officials – Loss to Government exchequer – Officers responsible for delay/ lapses to be penalized – Enormous delay of 1788 days in filing [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1281 State of Madhya Pradesh v.
