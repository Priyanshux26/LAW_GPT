Between the years 2019-20 to 2021-22 the Bond income has been 81% of the total unknown income of national parties. The total unknown income, that is donations made under Rs.20,000/-, sale of coupons etc. has not shown ebbing and has substantially increased from Rs.2,550 crores during the years 2014-15 to 2016-17 to Rs.8,489 crores during the years 2018-19 to 2021-22. To this we can add total income of the national political parties without other known sources, which has increased from Rs.3,864 crores during the years 2014-15 to 2016-17 to Rs.11,829 crores during the years 2018-19 to 2021-22. The Bonds income between the years 2018- 19 to 2021-22 constitutes 58% of the total income of the national political parties. '%” 72. Based on the analysis of the data currently available to us, along with our previous observation asserting that voters’ right to know supersedes anonymity in political party funding, | arrive at the conclusion that the Scheme fails to meet the balancing prong of the proportionality test. However, | would like to reiterate that | have not applied proportionality stricto sensu due to the limited availability of data and evidence. 73. | respectfully agree with the reasoning and the finding recorded by Hon’ble the Chief Justice, holding that the amendment to Section 182 of the Companies Act, deleting the first proviso thereunder should be struck down. While doing so, | would rather apply the principle of proportionality which, in my opinion, would subsume the test of manifest arbitrariness. '*° In addition, the claim of privacy 137 “Parties’ unknown income rise despite electoral bonds”, The Hindu, 02.11.2023, pg.7. 138 The proportionality test, as adopted and applied by us, essentially checks, invalidates and does not condone manifest arbitrariness. Proportionality analysis recognizes the thread of reasonableness which [2024] 2 S.C.R. 605 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. by a corporate or a company, especially a public limited company would be on very limited grounds, restricted possibly to protect the privacy of the individuals and persons responsible for conducting the business and commerce of the company. It will be rather difficult for a public (or even a private) limited company to claim a violation of privacy as its affairs have to be open to the shareholders and the public who are interacting with the body corporate/company. This principle would be equally, with some deference, apply to private limited companies, partnerships and sole proprietorships. 74. In consonance with the above reasoning and on application of the doctrine of proportionality, proviso to Section 29C(1) of the Representation of the People Act 1951, Section 182(3) of the Companies Act 2013 (as amended by the Finance Act 2017), Section 13A(b) of the Income Tax Act 1961 (as amended by the Finance Act 2017), are held to be unconstitutional. Similarly, Section 31(3) of the RBI Act 1934, along with the Explanation enacted by the Finance Act 2017, has to be struck down as unconstitutional, as it permits issuance of Bonds payable to a bearer on demand by such person.
