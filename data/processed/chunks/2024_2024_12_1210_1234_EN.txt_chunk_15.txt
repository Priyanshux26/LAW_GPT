13. In respect of the issue relating to payment of stamp duty for mutation of the subject land, it is the specific plea of the appellant that “consent decrees” / “decrees” are not chargeable with “stamp duty” under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as applicable to the State of Madhya Pradesh. Section 3 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 provides the instruments which are chargeable with duty and the same reads as under: “3. Instrument chargeable with duty— Subject to the provision of this Act and the exemptions contained is Schedule I, the following instrument shall be chargeable with duty of the amount indicated in the schedule as the proper duty therefore, respectively, that is to say- (a) Every instrument mentioned in that schedule which, not having been previously executed by any person, is executed in India on or after the first day of July 1899; (b) Every bill of exchange payable otherwise than on demand or promissory note drawn or made out of on or after that day and accepted or paid, or presented for acceptance or payment, or endorsed, transferred or otherwise negotiable in India; and (c) every instrument (other than a bill of exchange or promissory note) mentioned in that schedule, which not having been previously executed by any property situate, or to any matter or thing done, or to be done, in India and is received in India: Provided that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, and notwithstanding anything contained in clause (a), clause (b), or clause (c) of this section or in Schedule I, the amount indicated in schedule I-A to this Act shall, subject to the exemptions contained in that Schedule, be the duty chargeable on the instruments mentioned in clauses (aa) and (bb) of this proviso, as the proper duty thereof, respectively, - [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1233 Mukesh v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. (aa) every instrument, mentioned in schedule I-A as chargeable with duty under that schedule, which not having been previously executed by any person, is executed in Madhya Pradesh on or after the commencement of the Central Provinces and Berar Indian stamp (Amendment) Act, 1939; and (bb) every instrument mentioned in Schedule I-A as chargeable with duty under that schedule, which not having been previously executed by any person, is executed out of Madhya Pradesh on or after the commencement of the Central Provinces and Berar Indian Stamp (Amendment) Act, 1939 and relates to any property situated or to any matter or thing done or to be done, in Madhya Pradesh and is received in Madhya Pradesh: Provided further that no duty shall be chargeable in respect of- (1) any instrument executed by, or on behalf of, or in favour of, the Government in cases where, but for this exemption, the Government would be liable to pay the duty chargeable in respect of such instrument; (2) any instrument for the sale, transfer or other disposition, either absolutely, or by way of mortgage or otherwise, of any ship or vessel, or any part, interest, share or property of or in any ship or vessel registered under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 or under Act 19 of 1838, or the Indian Registration of Ships Act, 1841 as amended by subsequent Acts.” From the above, it is apparent that stamp duty is not chargeable on an /decree of the Court as the same do not fall within the documents mentioned in Schedule I or I-A read with Section 3 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.
