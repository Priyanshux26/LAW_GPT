Additionally, the solar energy sector in India has emerged as a significant contributor to grid-connected power generation capacity. It aligns with India’s agenda of sustainable growth and plays a crucial role in meeting the nation’s energy needs while enhancing energy security. 38. Solar energy holds a central place in India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change, with the National Solar Mission29 being one of its 28 Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Solar Overview (2023).

Launched on 11 January 2010, NSM aims to establish India as a global leader in solar energy by creating favourable policy conditions for the diffusion of solar technology across the country. This mission is in line with India’s Nationally Determined Contributions target, which aims to achieve about 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources and reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 45 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. India’s goal to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil- based electricity generation capacity by 2030 aligns with its efforts to be Net Zero by 2070. In 2023-24, out of the total generation capacity of 9,943 MW added, 8,269 is from non-fossil fuel sources. According to the Renewable Energy Statistics 2023 released by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), India has the 4th largest installed capacity of renewable energy.30 39. The International Solar Alliance31 was formed at the COP21 held in Paris in 2015, as a joint effort by India and France. It is an international platform with 94 member countries.32 It works with governments to improve energy access and security worldwide and promote solar power as a sustainable way to transition to a carbon-neutral future. ISA’s mission is to unlock USD 1 trillion of investments in solar energy by 2030 while reducing the cost of the technology and its financing. It is partnering with multilateral development banks, development financial institutions, private and public sector organisations, civil society, and other international institutions to deploy cost-effective and transformational energy solutions powered by the sun, especially in the least Developed Countries33 and the Small Island Developing States.34 40. The idea for the One Sun One World One Grid 35initiative was put forth by India at the First Assembly of the ISA in October 2018.36 The vision behind the OSOWOG initiative is the mantra that “the 30 IRENA, ‘Renewable capacity statistics 2023’.

This initiative aims to connect different regional grids through a common grid that will be used to transfer renewable energy power and, thus, realize the potential of renewable energy sources, especially solar energy.
