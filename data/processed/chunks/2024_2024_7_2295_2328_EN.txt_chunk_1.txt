05.12.1985 and was thereafter duly registered – The respondent No.2 has never challenged the [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2297 Kaushik Premkumar Mishra & Anr. v. Kanji Ravaria @ Kanji & Anr. said sale deed in favour of the collaterals – It is thus apparent that the family members and collaterals of the appellants purchased the entire land measuring 3.40 Hectares from respondent No.2 in equal shares by two separate documents which were executed on the same date and presented for registration on the same day – There is no specific denial in the written statement filed by respondent No.2 about the sale deed in favour of collaterals – General denial has been made by placing strict proof of liability on the plaintiff – The respondent No.2 apparently wants to take advantage of certain minor aberrations and minor technicalities and is also taking up self-conflicting pleas – As far as the question of payment of sale consideration is concerned, assuming that no sale consideration was paid even though there was a registered sale deed, it would be at the instance of the vendor to challenge the said sale deed on the ground of no sale consideration being paid – In the present, case, there is no such challenge to the sale deed for being declared as void or being cancelled on such ground – Regarding delay of 26 years in registering the document, Non-registration of a document duly presented for registration could be for many reasons – But once it is registered, there is a presumption of correctness attached to it, that is to say that the document has been duly executed and registered in accordance to law – It was for the defendants (respondents) to come forward and to establish that the document was wrongly registered – They did not lead any evidence in this respect – Instead, they tried to put burden on the plaintiff-appellant by requiring him to call the Sub-Registrar as a witness, which the appellant rightly denied – It was always open for the respondents to have called for the records of the Sub-Registrar’s office and also the Sub-Registrar in to find out any mandatory lacuna or illegality or lack of procedure not being followed with respect to the registration – They did nothing of this sort – In fact, respondent No.2 did not make any bone of contention with regard to the registration process and the registration of the documents after 26 years by challenging the same before the same authority or any superior authority or any Court of law – Registration of a document carries with it presumption of correctness until and unless the same was challenged by way of independent proceeding or a counter claim – In the absence of any such claim, the sale deed in favour of the appellants has to be treated as a valid document – The High Court recorded the findings that the fact that the purchasers were minors would not per se affect the validity of the sale deed for the reason that 2298 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
