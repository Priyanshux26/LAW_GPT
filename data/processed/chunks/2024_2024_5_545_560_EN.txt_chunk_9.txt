Ms. No. 155 dated 13th August 2015, issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu, which reads thus: “4. In accordance with the powers delegated under the general rule 48 of the Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Services Rules Volume II, the Governor of Tamil Nadu s relaxing the rule 2(a) and rule (5) of the Tamil Nadu Engineering Service (Category-1, Public Works) the so as to regularize the 72 Assistant Engineers (Civil) as per the Annexure of this who were appointed retrospectively from the category of Junior Engineers and promoted from the category of Technical Assistants who acquired B.E., Civil Degree before promotion as Junior Engineers so as to enable them for regularization of the services in the category of Assistant Engineers (Civil). Further, the Government also exempting them from the purview 558 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the G.O.(Ms).No. 1, Public Works Department dated 02.01.1990 for regularization of the personnel stated in the Annexure to this .” 23. It is thus clear that the contention of the appellants that the services of the Technical Assistants have not been regularized is contrary to record. In any case, the State Government, in its affidavit dated 10th March 2023, has categorically reaffirmed this position. 24. It is further relevant to note the relevant extract from the Proceedings No. S2(2)/2918/2004-24 dated 27th February 2006 conducted before the Engineer-in-Chief, W.R.D and Chief Engineer (General), PWD, which reads thus: “During the year from 1999-2000 to 2001-2002 the number of 369 vacancies have been apportioned to the post of Assistant Engineer to be filled up by direct recruitment and the number of 122 vacancies have been apportioned to the post Asst. Engineer to be filled up by recruitment by transfer. Out of 122 vacancies apportioned to the post of Assistant Engineer to be filled up by recruitment by transfer, only 29 vacancies have been filled up so far, from the Junior Draughting Officers, Draughting Officers and Overseers. The remaining number of 93 vacancies are still vacant due to dearth of eligible candidates. Under these circumstances and also pursuant to the directions of the Government, PWD issued in the letter fourth cited the personnels in the category of Technical Assistant, who possessed B.E/A.M.I.E qualification in civil Engineering and rendered 5 years of service, furnished to this proceedings are appointed as Asst.

It can thus clearly be seen that the State Government was required to take a decision to appoint Technical Assistants as Assistant [2024] 5 S.C.R. 559 Association of Engineers and Others Etc. v. The State of Tamil Nadu and Others Etc. Engineers on temporary basis as it was found that out of 122 vacancies apportioned to the post of Assistant Engineer to be filled up by recruitment by transfer, only 29 vacancies had been filled so far.
