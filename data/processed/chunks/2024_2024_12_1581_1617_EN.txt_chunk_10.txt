[2024] 11 S.C.R. 1595 North Delhi Municipal Corporation v. M/s. S.A. Builders Ltd. 32.1. This position is clear and unambiguous. Notwithstanding the same, after a period of about 8 years, respondent, at the stage of execution proceeding, made a request before the Division Bench of the High Court for clarification from the learned Arbitrator as to whether the interest was awarded under Section 31(7) of the 1996 Act or not. Without expressing any opinion on the said issue, Division Bench vide the dated 03.01.2005 permitted the respondent to approach the learned Arbitrator for clarification. Though this decision of the Division Bench was challenged before this Court by the appellant by way of special leave petition, the same was dismissed. 32.2. Learned senior counsel submits that the clarification sought for by the respondent from the learned Arbitrator was that in the award it was not specifically mentioned that interest was granted under sub-Section(7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act. Highlighting this aspect, learned senior counsel submits that learned Arbitrator was requested only to specifically mention whether the interest was awarded under Section 31(7) of the 1996 Act or not. 32.3. She further submits that in the clarificatory proceedings before the learned Arbitrator, it was specifically urged on behalf of the appellant that the learned Arbitrator had awarded past, pendente lite and future interest in terms of Section 31(7) of the 1996 Act. However, in the garb of issuing a clarification, learned Arbitrator fundamentally altered the award resulting in heavy financial burden on the appellant. 32.4. Therefore, learned Arbitrator had transgressed the scope of clarification sought for by the respondent, much beyond the scope of Section 33(1)(a) of the 1996 Act. 32.5. Learned senior counsel in support of her above contention has placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Gyan Prakash Arya Vs. Titan Industries Ltd.,4 more particularly on paragraph 13 thereof. 32.6. Ms. Divan vehemently argued that under the 1996 Act the arbitration proceedings came to be terminated upon making 4 (2023) 1 SCC 153 1596 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of the award under Section 32 thereof. Any fresh award beyond the four corners of Section 33 of the said Act is barred and would be a nullity. It is a case of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and, therefore, the clarification is non est in the eyes of law. In this connection, she has referred to a decision of this Court in Harshad Chiman Lal Modi Vs. DLF Universal Ltd.,5 more particularly to paragraphs 30 to 33 thereof. Any passed by a tribunal lacking inherent jurisdiction would be coram non judice. Such an would be a nullity and is non est. The same can be questioned at any stage i.e. at the stage of execution or even in a collateral proceeding. 32.7. Proceeding further, learned senior counsel submits that this Court never had the opportunity in the earlier proceedings to examine the issue as to whether learned Arbitrator had acted without jurisdiction while issuing the clarification which resulted in modifying the original award.
