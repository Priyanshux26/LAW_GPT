The appellant did not question their promotions before any Court or Tribunal at any stage. 50. Thus, much water has flown under the bridge and retrospective application of the GO issued in 2015 would open floodgates of litigation and would disturb the seniority of many employees causing them grave prejudice and heartburn as it would disturb the crystallized rights regarding seniority, rank and promotion which would have accrued to them during the intervening period. To alter a seniority list after such a long period would be totally unjust to the multitudes of employees who could get caught in the labyrinth of uncertainty for no fault of theirs and may suffer loss of their seniority rights retrospectively. 51. Keeping in mind the afore-stated principles, we are of the view that applicability of the Government dated 4th August, 2015 cannot enure to the benefit of the appellant as its operation is clearly prospective. 39 [1997] Supp. 6 SCR 451 : (1998) 2 SCC 523 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 149 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others 52. In wake of the above discussion, we find that the impugned of the High Court does not suffer from any infirmity warranting interference. 53. This appeal is dismissed as being devoid of merit. No as to costs. 54. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. CIVIL APPEAL @ SLP(Civil) D. No. 3704-3706 of 2012) 55.
