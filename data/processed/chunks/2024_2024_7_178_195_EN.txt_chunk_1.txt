Digital Supreme Court Reports irrespective of the fact it was not raised appropriately, it must be considered lest the byproduct of consideration of the case would result in miscarriage of justice – Being the Court existing for dispensation of justice, this Court is bound to consider and correct the mistake committed by the Court by looking into the question whether non-examination or inadequate examination of accused concerned caused material prejudice or miscarriage of justice. [Paras 15, 16] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.313 – Object: Held: s.313 embodies salutary principle of natural justice viz., audi alteram partem and empowering the Court to examine the accused thereunder is to give the accused concerned an opportunity to explain the incriminating circumstances appearing against him in the prosecution evidence – The general position is that if any incriminating circumstance, appearing against an accused in the prosecution evidence, is not put to him it should not be used against him and must be excluded from consideration – At the same time, it is a well-settled position that non-examination or inadequate examination u/s.313 on any incriminating circumstance, by itself, would not vitiate a trial qua the convict concerned unless it has resulted in material prejudice to him or in miscarriage of justice. [Para 11] Practice and Procedure – not containing discussion on a particular point – Said point is to be prima facie assumed not to have been argued unless contrary is shown – Contention of the appellant as regards non-examination/inadequate examination u/s.313 causing material prejudice to him, if was argued before the High Court: Held: Normally, it has to be presumed that all the arguments actually pressed at the hearing in the High Court were noticed and appropriately dealt with and if the of the High Court does not contain discussion on a point, then that point should be assumed prima facie not to have been argued at the bar unless the contrary is specifically shown – In the present case, though grounds A to Z and AA to GG were taken in this appeal, there was absolute absence of any contention in any one of them to the effect that despite being pressed into, the contention as regards non-examination u/s. 313 was not taken into consideration and appropriately dealt with by the High Court – Hence, the conclusion can only be that it was not argued.
