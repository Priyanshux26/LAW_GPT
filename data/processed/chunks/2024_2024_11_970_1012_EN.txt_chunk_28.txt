79. The Petitioner and NALSAR CDS have proposed a series of recommendations with regard to the existing legal framework. The Union Government is directed to meaningfully consider these recommendations while reworking the content of Rule 15. 80. NALSAR-CDS states that the report has been prepared using their own resources, and no financial claims have been made to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Annexure II of the NALSAR- CDS Report indicates that it has been prepared over a period of six months, after consulting fifty-two experts, receiving reports from fourteen states and three Union Territories, and with over hundred reports from organizations and individual testimonies. As the report states, it is “a present-day example of creating a knowledge commons.” This Court records its appreciation for and is cognizant of the labour of time, effort, and resources expended by the NALSAR-CDS in preparing this report. Accordingly, the Union of India in the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is directed to pay NALSAR-CDS an amount of INR 50,00,000 as compensation for the work, which was carried out in a timely and comprehensive manner. The amount shall be disbursed to NALSAR-CDS no later than 15 December 2024. 81. With the above direction, the Writ Petitions are adjourned to 7 March 2025 on which date, the Union Government must report compliance to this Court.
