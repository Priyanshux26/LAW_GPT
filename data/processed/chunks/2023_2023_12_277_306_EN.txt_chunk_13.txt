In the said case, the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioner therein had made an application for grant of lease before the State of Odisha for mining of Iron Ore in an area measuring 1250 acres. The application was in view of the proposal to set up a steel plant in the district of Sambalpur, Odisha. The rejection for the grant of the mining lease to M/s. Bhushan Power and Steel Limited was challenged in a Writ Petition in the High Court, which was dismissed, but the appeal preferred before this Court was allowed vide dated 14.03.2012 in Bhushan Power and Steel 10 (2017) 2 SCC 125. 294 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. Limited and Others v. State of Orissa and Another11, setting aside the of the State Government dated 09.02.2016, with the following directions: “41. In the light of the above, the High Court erred in holding that it could not interfere with the decision of the State Government calling upon the appellants to sign a fresh MoU with the Government, during subsistence of the earlier MoU. Since the State Government has already made allotments in favour of others in relaxation of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, under Rule 59(2) thereof, no cogent ground had been made out on behalf of the State to deny the said privilege to the appellants as well. Accordingly, we allow the appeal and set aside the and of the High Court of Orissa and also the decision of the State Government dated 9-2-2006, rejecting the appellants’ claim for grant of mining lease. 42. During the course of hearing, we have been informed that Thakurani Block A has large reserves of iron ore, in which the appellants can also be accommodated. We, accordingly, direct the State of Orissa to take appropriate steps to act in terms of the MoU dated 15-5-2002, as also its earlier commitments to recommend the case of the appellants to the Central Government for grant of adequate iron ore reserves to meet the requirements of the appellants in their steel plant at Lapanga.” 9. The State of Odisha thereafter fi led an application for review of the in Bhushan Power and Steel Limited and Others v. State of Orissa and Another12(supra)which was rejected vide dated 11.09.2012. 10. Alleging non-compliance and in-action of the dated 14.03.2012, a contempt petition was fi led by M/s Bhushan Power and Steel Limited. The contempt petition was contested by the State of Odisha on several grounds, including that the dated 14.03.2012 is incapable of enforcement, for which reliance was placed on a subsequent of this Court in Sandur Manganese and Iron Ores Ltd. v. State of Karnataka13. This stand did not fi nd favour with this Court and the offi cers of the State Government were found to be in contempt of the dated 14.03.2012 11 (2012) 4 SCC 246. 12 (2012) 4 SCC 246. 13 (2010) 13 SCC 1.
