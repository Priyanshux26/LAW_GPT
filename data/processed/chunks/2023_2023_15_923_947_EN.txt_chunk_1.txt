[Paras 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 30] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 215 – Eff ect of errors – Conviction of an accused for an off ence with which he may not have been specifi cally charged with – Permissibility – Accused having been tried for the off ences punishable u/ss. 498A, 304B IPC and ss. 3 and 4 of DP Act, if can be convicted for the off ence punishable u/s. 306 IPC though not charged for said off ence: Held: Omission to frame charge does not disable the court from convicting the accused for the off ence which is found to have been proved on the evidence on record – On facts, from the statement of charge framed u/s. 304B and in the alternative s. 306, it is clear that all the facts and ingredients for framing the charge for off ence u/s. 306 existed – Mere omission on the part of the trial judge to mention s. 306 IPC with 498A would not preclude this Court from convicting the accused for the said off ence when found proved – In the charge framed u/s. 304B, it is clearly mentioned that dying declaration of the deceased indicates that deceased was mentally traumatized and she was unable to tolerate the torture and harassment meted out by the accused person on account of which she committed suicide by self immolation and as such non-framing of the specifi c charge would not be fatal as no injustice is being caused to the accused – Thus, the accused persons liable to be convicted for the off ence punishable u/s. 306 though charge was not framed – Penal Code, 1860 – ss. 304B, 306 – Dowry Prohibition Act – ss. 3 and 4.
