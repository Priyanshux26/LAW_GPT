217. But there are two major obstacles for the Asset Reconstruction Company which is the applicant in this I.A. The first is that this Asset Reconstruction Company actually filed I.A.No.3 of 2019 E in OSANo.54 of 2004; I.A.No.3 of 2019 in OSANo.56 of 2004 and I.A.No.4 of 2019 in OSANo.59 of 2004 before the High Court. All these applications for impleadment were dismissed by the High Court by the impugned in these appeals. Other persons who filed similar impleading applications which were also dismissed by the High Court, F have come up with independent appeals against the entire impugned . This is because the dismissing their impleadment applications is part of the operative portion of the whole impugned . Therefore, the Asset Reconstruction Company ought to have filed independent appeals against the dismissal of their impleadment applications by the High Court. They cannot now have a piggy-back G ride on the appeals filed by others. 218. The second difficulty that the Asset Reconstruction Company has, is that six different companies created an equitable mortgage by deposit of title deeds. As per the averment contained in Para 2 of I.A.No.110290 of 2022, the deposit of title deeds happened on 25.03.2009. H 372 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A What is said to have been deposited are the certified copies of the final decree in Application No.517 of 1998 in CS No.14 of 1958 dated 24.04.1998. 219. We do not know how a final decree in a partition suit and that too in a notorious suit like CSNo.14 of 1958 could have been taken B to be a document of title which can be accepted by way of equitable mortgage. In any case, the deposit of title deeds is said to have taken place on 25.03.2009. By this time, the of the learned Single Judge (L. Narasimha Reddy, J.) dated 26.10.2004 allowing the claims of the obstructionists had come into existence. Though the said of the learned Single Judge dated 26.10.2004 was set aside by the Division C Bench by an dated 23.06.2006, the said of the Division Bench had become the subject matter of the civil appeals even at that time. These civil appeals were eventually allowed by this Court by an dated 05.03.2014. We do not know how during this interregnum period, the Banks could have accepted this property as security, despite the D same being the subject matter of a serious long drawn litigation. 220. In any case, the applications for impleadment made by the Asset Reconstruction Company have been dismissed by the High Court by the impugned in these appeals. Without challenging the same, the Asset Reconstruction Company cannot seek to implead themselves E in the appeals filed by the third parties and the mortgagors. Therefore, I.A. 110290 of 2022, is dismissed. Part-IX: I.A. Nos.36417, 36419 and 36422 of 2023 in Special Leave Petition (C) Nos.2373-2377 of 2020 F 221. These applications praying respectively for, (i) leave to get impleaded; (ii) impleadment; and (iii) directions, have been filed by a Cooperative Housing Society by name M/s Durga Matha House Building Construction Co-operative Housing Society Ltd.
