CORPORATION, REP. BY THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR v. 165 M/s. ENDOCRINOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY LAB [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] Corporation and with the approval of the Central Government. In terms of the aforesaid notifi cation, medical institutions including diagnostic and pathological laboratories, where 20 or more persons were employed, were covered. The relevant part of the said notifi cation is extracted below: “GOVERNMENT OF KERALA LABOUR & REHABILITATION (F) DEPARTMENT NOTIFICATION G.O. (P) NO/116/2007/LBR Dated, Thiruvanthapuram 6TH September 2007 S R O No.749/2007 – In exercise of the power conferred by sub-section (5) of Section 1 of the Employees’ State Insurance Act 1948 (Central Act 34 of 1948), the Government of Kerala in consultation with the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation and with the approval of the Central Government and after having given six months’ notice of its intention to do hereby extend the provisions of the said Act to the classes of establishments specifi ed in Column (1) of the Schedule annexed hereto and situated in the areas specifi ed in column (2) thereof with immediate eff ect SCHEDULE Description of establishment Areas in which the establishments are situated Medical institution (including Areas where the scheme has al- corporate, joint sector, trust, ready been brought into force un- charitable, and private der sub-section (2) and (5) of Sec- ownership hospitals, nursing tion 1 of the Act homes, diagnostic centre, pathological laboratories wherein 20 or more persons are employed or were employed on any day of the preceding twelve months 13. A perusal of the aforesaid notifi cation shows that pathological laboratories were specifi cally covered under the provisions of the Act in terms of the aforesaid notifi cation. In the case at hand, the respondent is running pathological laboratory and would be covered under the Act in terms of the Notifi cation dated 06.09.2007, issued by the Government of 166 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. Kerala. The passed by the High Court is in terms of the aforesaid notifi cation directing coverage of the respondent establishment from that date onwards, as undisputedly, 20 or more persons were found to be employed in the establishment. 14. The argument raised by the appellant that the respondent establishment should be deemed to be covered in terms of the Notifi cation issued on 27.05.1976 read with the Circular dated 22.11.2002 issued by the Corporation, is merely to be noticed and rejected. It is admittedly the case of the Corporation itself that the term “shop” as such has not been defi ned under the Act. It was sought to be assigned a meaning as per the understanding of the “Corporation”. Clause 23 of the aforesaid letter shows that even as per the earlier Memo dated 06.01.1989, pathological laboratories were not covered as shops under Section 1(5) of the Act. The aforesaid Memo letter was subsequently modifi ed vide Memo letter dated 22.11.2002. 15. Further, fact remains that there is a Notification issued on 06.09.2007 by the Government of Kerala covering medical institutions including pathological laboratories from that date.
