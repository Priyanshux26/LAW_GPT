In respect of the recovery certifi cate issued on 17.10.2017, the State Bank of India claimed to be entitled to Rs.368,22,13,348.59/-. 3. The State Bank of India’s application under Section 7 of the IBC was fi led on 06.09.2019 before the NCLT, founded on all the three recovery certifi cates in which the fi rst respondent had substantial stake. In its passed on 12.01.2021, the adjudicating authority admitted the application and declared moratorium in terms of Section 14 of the IBC. By this , one G. Satyanarayana Murty was appointed as Interim Resolution Professional (IRP). The appellant, who was the managing director of the corporate debtor, appealed against the said decision of the NCLT admitting the application and declaring moratorium primarily on the ground of limitation. Before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (the Appellate Tribunal), a point was urged, apart from the issue of limitation, that the application had been initiated as per the Reserve Bank of India circular dated 12.02.2018 which was held to be ultra vires the provision of Section 35AA of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 by this Court in the case of Dharani Sugars and Chemicals Ltd. -vs- Union of India and Others [(2019) 5 SCC 480]. This circular essentially laid down norms for, inter-alia, invoking IBC in relation to stressed assets. The NCLT had taken into consideration a letter TOTTEMPUDI SALALITH v. STATE BANK OF INDIA & 497 ORS. [ANIRUDDHA BOSE, J.] issued by the corporate debtor on 29.01.2020 addressed to the Union Bank and the State Bank of India, agreeing in principle to repay the amount due to the fi nancial creditors. The same letter requested the banks to support the corporate debtor during the fi nancial crises being faced by them and sought waiver of penal interest levied. A request for one time settlement was also made in this communication. The NCLT treated this letter to be an acknowledgement of debt. In its decision taken on 12.01.2021 while admitting the application, it was, inter-alia, observed:- “….We, are therefore, of the view that by accepting liability vide their letter dated 29.01.2020, agreeing to repay the debt, the Corporate Debtor now cannot take a stand that the debt is barred by limitation. Acknowledgement of debt and agreeing to repay the same amounts to liability and it automatically extends the limitation period.” The Appellate Tribunal broadly agreed with the reasoning of the NCLT and sustained the decision delivered on 12.01.2021. 4. The pleas of the appellant before the Appellate Tribunal were mainly on procedural grounds. Apart from the question of limitation, arguments were advanced that the application before the NCLT was barred under the doctrine of election, the borrower having chosen the SARFAESI mechanism fi rst and having applied before the DRT. Point of limitation was also reiterated. On the issue involving the RBI Circular dated 12.02.2018 the case of the appellant was that the banks had approached the forum under the IBC, on the basis of the aforesaid circular. The said circular was, however, quashed in the case of Dharani Sugars and Chemicals Ltd. (supra).
