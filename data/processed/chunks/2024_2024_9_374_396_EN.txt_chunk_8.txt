Having sanctioned the Plans, the appellant-Corporation cannot run away from its duty of preventing pollution in the area on account of GPP. 21. Insofar as the contention that the MPCB was only granting authorization and not consent, Shri Laud submitted that merely because the MPCB was following a particular practice, it cannot absolve the appellant- Corporation of obtaining consent under the Water Act, 1974 or the Air Act, 1981 which are statutory requirements. Shri Laud submitted that the 2003 checklist is traceable to 2000 Rules. 22. Shri Laud further submitted that, a perusal of the Joint Inspection Committee Report itself would reveal that the Joint Inspection officials felt prevalence of odour in and around the plant premises. He further submitted that the Joint Inspection Committee also found that the segregation rejects has been transported in open truck without any cover. He has submitted that the said Report also suggests that such open carriage would cause nuisance during transportation. He therefore submitted that it is clear that the GPP was causing pollution in the area thereby making the life of the residents of respondent No. 1 miserable. He submitted that, not only that even the suggestions which are given by the National Engineering and Environment Research Institute14 have also not been implemented. 14 Hereinafter referred to as the “NEERI”. 386 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 23. Shri Laud, in the alternative, submitted that, in the event this Court is inclined to hold that the GPP is entitled to continue its operations, the Court should issue stringent directions so that the residents are not compelled to suffer the pollution. 24. Shri Kaushik, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the MPCB also accepts the position that, at the relevant time i.e. when the GPP commenced, the MPCB was following the practice of only granting authorization and only after its circular dated 6th September 2021, it has started granting consent. He therefore submitted that accordingly, the first consent was granted on 1st November 2022 and the second consent has been granted on 16th March 2024. 25. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also perused the materials placed on record. 26. A perusal of the proposed Land Use Map for village Balewadi, Baner which was notified on 31st December 2002 would reveal that in the said Plan, Plot No. 48/2/1 has been reserved for GPP. Plot Nos. 49/289/50 and 7 have been shown in Green Belt. The Draft Development Plan was published under Section 28(4) of the MRTP Act on 30th November 2005. In the said Plan also, Plot No. 48/2/1 has been shown as reserved for GPP. Plot Nos. 49/289/50 and 7 have been reserved for Bio-diversity Park (BDP). The Government of Maharashtra vide notification dated 18th September 2008 sanctioned the said Draft Development Plan. It could thus clearly be seen that right from 2002, the Plot in question has been reserved for GPP. As already observed hereinabove, the first building was granted commencement certificate on 27th December 2005 whereas the second was granted commencement certificate on 25th March 2008 and all other, that is 17 buildings, have been granted commencement certificate only after 2008.
