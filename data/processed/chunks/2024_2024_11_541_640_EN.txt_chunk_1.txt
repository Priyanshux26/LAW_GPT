[Paras 131(I), (II)] Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 – ss.2(10), 3, 10(e) to (h), Chapter II- s.10(2)(e) – Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 – r.14 – Form 4 – ‘Transport Vehicle’ in s.3 – Purpose – 1994 amendment substituted four classes of ‘medium goods vehicle’, ‘medium passenger vehicle’, ‘heavy goods vehicle’, and ‘heavy passenger vehicle’ under clauses (e) to (h) in s.10 with a single class of ‘Transport Vehicle’ in s.10(2)(e) – Effect – Plea of insurance companies that in view of the ‘transport vehicle’ having been specifically mentioned after the amendment, a separate endorsement would be necessary to drive a ‘transport vehicle’ and that even before the 1994 amendment, the second part of s.3 always provided that a separate endorsement would be necessary: Held: The specific authorization does not mean that a person holding an LMV license which covers ‘Transport vehicle’, would be disentitled to drive a ‘Transport Vehicle’ – The emphasis in the second part of Section 3 is in relation to Medium and Heavy Vehicles in the statutory scheme even prior to the 1994 amendment – Second part of Section 3 pertains to a driving license for those driving ‘medium goods vehicle’, ‘medium passenger vehicle’, [2024] 11 S.C.R. 543 M/s Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rambha Devi & Ors. ‘heavy goods vehicle’, and ‘heavy passenger vehicle’ – Such an interpretation is logical because medium and heavy vehicles would require greater maneuverability and skill as compared to drivers of the LMV class – The subsequent amendment in Section 10 makes this position even clearer – ‘Transport Vehicle’ primarily targets vehicles exceeding 7,500 kgs, for the purpose of license regime – The intention of the legislature was to simplify the licensing framework for larger commercial vehicles and at the same time not interdict a LMV license holder to also drive a transport vehicle – National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Annappa Irappa Nesaria [2008] 1 SCR 1061 holding that the 1994 amendment had a prospective operation, partially overruled – ‘Transport Vehicle’, does not exclude transport vehicles already classified as ‘LMV’, under Section 10 – Thus, ‘Transport vehicles’ mentioned in Section 10 would cover only those vehicles whose gross vehicle weight is above 7,500 kgs – Such an interpretation aligns with the broader purpose of the amendments and ensures that the licensing regime remains efficient and practical for vehicle owners and drivers – Section 10 is to be read with Section 2(21) which defines a ‘Light Motor Vehicle’. [Paras 41, 42, 44.3, 45] Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 – Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 – Whether the additional eligibility criteria prescribed in the MV Act and MV Rules for ‘transport vehicles’ would apply to those who are desirous of driving vehicles weighing below 7,500 kgs: Held: No – The additional eligibility criteria specified in the MV Act and MV Rules will apply only to such vehicle (‘medium goods vehicle’, ‘medium passenger vehicle’, ‘heavy goods vehicle’ and ‘heavy passenger vehicle’), whose gross weight exceeds 7,500 Kg – This interpretation on how the licensing regime is to operate for drivers under the statutory scheme will not compromise the road safety concerns and will also effectively address the livelihood issues for drivers operating Transport Vehicles in legally operating “Transport vehicles” (below 7,500 Kg), with their LMV driving license.
