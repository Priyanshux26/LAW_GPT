[Paras 283, 286, 290] Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – Object and scope of – MMDR Act vis-a-vis Entry 50 List II: Held: (per B. V. Nagarathna, J.) MMDR Act contemplates all manner of levies, charges, impost or demands that could be provided for having a nexus with mineral rights – Thus, the Act itself has to be construed as a limitation on the power of the States to demand or impose levies to the extent to which is stated in the Act – Though, Entry 50 List II is a taxing Entry, it would be subject to the limitations enacted by the Parliament by law under Entry 54 List I – States cannot impose levies under Entry 50 List II over and above the amount of royalty received by them under the MMDR Act – Entry 50 List II is sui generis because it is the only legislative Entry which limits the taxing powers of the State legislatures by reference to a general law – Thus, expression “mineral development” found in Entry 50 List II has to be traced to the entire architecture of the MMDR Act which serves as limitation of taxing power of the State legislature under Entry 50 List II – To read it otherwise would lead to destruction of the federal balance – Further, tax on mineral right would also include royalty as envisaged u/s.9 and other Sections of the MMDR Act and every holder of mining lease is bound to pay royalty irrespective of the owner of the mineral bearing land, 1572 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in terms of s.9 read with Second Schedule to the said Act – Thus, royalty is in the nature of a tax on mineral rights – Also the MMDR Act and the Rules made thereunder is a complete Code on the regulation of mineral development – State legislature cannot, on the basis of royalty paid, levy any other tax, cess or surcharge on cess – States can only levy tax on sale of mineral as per Entry 54 List II which is not a tax on mineral rights – Moreover, Entry 50 List II is a recognition of parliamentary superiority via imposition of a limitation. [Paras 39, 39.1] Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 – ss.2, 9, 9A – India Cement’s case holding that royalty is a tax – Effect of overruling India Cement: Held: (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.) If royalty is not held to be a tax and the same being covered under the provisions of the MMDR Act, it would imply that despite Entry 54 List I and ss.2, 9, 9A and other provisions, taxes on mineral rights could be imposed by States over and above payment of royalty on a holder of a mining lease – Limitation that Parliament has made by law on the taxing power of a State explicitly stated in Entry 50 List II would be given a go by and the States could pass laws imposing taxes, cesses, surcharge on cess, etc.
