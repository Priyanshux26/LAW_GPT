OF CEN. EXC. AHMEDABAD v. M/S URMIN 587 PRODUCTS P. LTD. AND OTHERS [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] 9. The detailed discussion of the relevant provisions, rules, notifi cations, and circulars and its applicability or otherwise, have been deliberated upon while analysing the facts under each of the group. A PRELUDE TO THE LIS 10. We deem it necessary to briefl y state the history of classifi cation of these two competing entries which have been the pivotal issue in all these groups of appeals before this Court, i.e., CET SH 2403 9910 (‘chewing tobacco’) and CET SH 2403 9930 (‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’) 11. At the outset, it may be noticed that the expressions ‘chewing tobacco’ and ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ are nowhere defi ned under the CE ACT or CETA. CETA initially covered ‘tobacco’ in item No.9 to the schedule. Entry 9(II) was country tobacco and sub-clause (2) thereof read “if intended for sale as chewing tobacco, whether manufactured or merely cured.” In 1983, ‘tobacco’ was covered under Item 4 of the Schedule of the CE Act. The relevant entry being Entry 4 II (5) which covered ‘chewing tobacco’. In 1985, the CETA was enacted and ‘Chewing tobacco’ was shown under Entry 4 II (4). The Finance Act,1987, inserted “CET SH 2404.39” with eff ect from 01.03.1987. The heading included the following: “Chewing tobacco including preparations commonly known as Khara Masala, Kiwam, Dokta, Zarda, Sukha and Surti”. Thus, for the first time ‘Zarda’ was recognized separately as preparation. 12. In 1996-97, CET SH 2404.40 was reformulated to read “chewing tobacco and preparations containing chewing tobacco”. 13. In 2002, under Section 4A of the CE Act, Notifi cation No. 13/2002 – CE (NT) dated 01.03.2002 was issued prescribing abatement as percentage of retail sale price. However, it is to be noticed that Notifi cation No.13/2002 had not covered ‘Chewing Tobacco’ refl ecting under the relevant Entry 2404.21, within its ambit of ‘notifi ed goods’ for the purposes of availing benefi ts under Section 4A.
