Rule 6 deals with ‘minimum ceiling of pension/family pension’, which reads as under: “6(1). The fixation of revised entitlement of pension shall be subject to the provision that the revised entitlement of pension so worked out shall, in no case, be lower than fifty percent of the minimum of the pay in the pay band + grade pay in the corresponding revised scale in terms of Haryana Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008, or as the case may be, Haryana Civil Services (Assured Career Progression) Rules, 2008, to the pre-revised pay scale from which the pensioner had retired. (2) The entitlement of pension calculated at 50 per cent of the minimum of pay in the pay band plus grade pay would be at the minimum of the pay in the pay band (irrespective of the pre-revised scale of pay) plus the grade pay corresponding to the pre-revised pay scale. For example, if a pensioner had retired in the pre-revised scale of pay of Rs.18400-22400, the corresponding pay band being Rs.37400-67000 and the corresponding grade pay being Rs.10,000/- per month his minimum guaranteed pension would be 50 per cent of Rs.37400/- + Rs.10,000 that is Rs.23,700/-. (3) The entitlement of pension is worked out in terms of sub-rules (1) and (2) above shall further be reduced pro-rata in all cases, where the pensioner had less than the minimum service required for full pension as per rules as applicable on 1st January, 2006 and in no case, it will be less than Rs.3500/- per month.” Pursuant to the aforesaid Rules, pay scale was revised and the teachers working in the Government Colleges were receiving the revised pension. While so, the Higher Education Commissioner, Haryana, sent a communication dated 07.09.2010 to the banks, stating that the revised pension will be payable only to those, 1742 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports who were in service as on 01.01.2006 and not to those who had retired prior to 01.01.2006 and accordingly, ed to reduce the pension and recover the excess payment made. The said was challenged in CWP No.19266 of 2010 and connected cases, titled as Satyapal Yadav v. State of Haryana and others. By dated 25.07.2012, the said civil writ petitions came to be allowed, by setting aside the dated 07.09.2010 passed by the Higher Education Commissioner, Haryana, after having held by the learned Single Judge that the petitioners therein had completed 3 years of service in the pre-revised scale of Rs.12000 – 18300 prior to their retirement, i.e., before 01.01.2006, and hence, they are entitled to the fixation of pension by placing them in the minimum pay band of Rs.37400 – 67000 with AGP of Rs.9000/- or revision of their pension / family pension with effect from 01.01.2006. The appeals6 preferred by the State before the Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana as well as this Court, ended in dismissal. Since the dated 25.07.2012 passed in CWP.No.19266 of 2010 and connected cases, attained finality, the Haryana Government complied with the same, by dated 07.11.2014.
