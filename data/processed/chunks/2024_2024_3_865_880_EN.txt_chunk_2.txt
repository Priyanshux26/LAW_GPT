The present civil appeal lays a challenge to the and dated 05th September, 2012 (“impugned ”, hereafter) of the Principal Bench of the Armed Forces Tribunal at New Delhi (“AFT”, [2024] 3 S.C.R. 869 Satyanand Singh v. Union of India & Ors. hereafter), whereby the AFT rejected the appellant’s prayer seeking reference of his diagnosis as AIDS inflicted, to a fresh Medical Board. BRIEF RESUME OF FACTS 2. The factual matrix of the case, insofar as is relevant for the purpose of a decision on this appeal, is noted hereinbelow: (i) The appellant was enrolled in the Indian Army on 30th October, 1993 as a Havaldar. He continued discharging his duties on a clerical post without impediment until the year 1999, when he began suffering from fever, headache and vomiting. For treatment he was referred to the Jabalpur Military Hospital. Here, the appellant tested positive for HIV. (ii) On 9th January, 2000, the Army Headquarters issued a Notice (“Notice”, hereafter) stating that all persons who are HIV+ve and are suffering from pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis, would be considered as AIDS cases. (iii) Thereafter, on 20th August, 2001, the appellant developed similar symptoms yet again, for which he was referred to the Jabalpur Military Hospital. The doctors there prescribed certain medicines to the appellant, which he claims led to his developing double vision. The appellant was referred to the Command Hospital at Pune for further treatment. (iv) In view of the appellant’s ocular afflictions, the doctors, suspecting the same to be a symptom of neuro-tuberculosis, began treating him for the same. Vide Medical Report dated 14th September, 2001 (“Medical Report” hereafter), the appellant was reported to be suffering from “AIDS defining illness in the form of neuro-tuberculosis”, and thus was officially diagnosed with AIDS. The appellant was then recommended to be invalided out in the “P5” category.
