The question is whether a legislative enactment can be challenged for contravention of Article 355 of the Constitution. For more than one reason, I think that such an interpretation would lead to disastrous consequences. Article 355 casts a duty on the Union to (a) protect every State against “external aggression”; (b) protect every State against “internal disturbance”; and (c) ensure that the “government of every State is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution”. All these three phrases (internal disturbance, external aggression and government of the State to be carried out 149 W.N Hohfeld, Fundamental Legal Conceptions as applied in Judicial Reasoning and other legal essays (W.W. Cook ed., Yale University Press, 1919). 150 See Constitution of India, Articles 352 and 356 151 Dr BR Ambedkar, Constituent Assembly Debates (Volume 9, 3 August 1949) 152 [1994] 2 SCR 644 : (1994) 3 SCC 1 153 [1994] 2 SCR 644 : (1994) 3 SCC 1 [57] 1292 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution) feature in Part XVIII of the Constitution which deals with emergency powers. If the duty of the Union to safeguard States against external aggression is justiciable in view of Article 355, then petitions could be filed claiming that the Union has not appropriately dealt with ‘any’ of the situations referred to in Article 355. It could also be contended that emergency powers ought to have been invoked by the Union to deal with the situations appropriately. Reading the duty in Article 355 into a right would effectively place the emergency powers with citizens and courts. Such a consequence would be catastrophic for the federal structure of the Indian Constitution and would subjugate the constitutional status of States. Article 355 cannot be elevated as an independent ground of judicial review in view of the purpose of the provision (as a justification clause) and the impact of such a reading on the federal framework of the Constitution. 90. The validity of the exercise of the Presidential power under Part XVIII (such as Article 352 and Article 356) has been held to be amenable to judicial review.154 Proclamations under Articles 352 and 356 are amenable to review on the ground that the exercise of power is beyond the limits of the power prescribed by the constitutional provision. The petitioners in this case, however, seek to challenge the constitutional validity of a legislative provision (Section 6A) on the ground of Article 355. In doing so they seek to elevate Article 355 to an independent ground for judicial review of legislative action. This is beyond the scope of the provision. Besides a lack of legislative competence and a violation of Part III, legislation may be challenged for breach of a substantive limitation on legislative power, created by a constitutional provision. Article 355 is not however such a provision. iv. Section 6A does not violate Article 29(1) of the Constitution 91. Article 29(1) of the Constitution provides that ‘any section of citizens’ residing in the territory of India or any part thereof and having a distinct language, script, or culture of their own shall have the right to conserve the same’.
