Further, learned counsel for Respondent No.1 pointed out that on 30.03.2013, the Respondent No.1, on the same terms, self-assessed the royalties for the years 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, as Rs.48,600/-, Rs.48,600/- and Rs.31,000/-, respectively and deposited the same on 30.03.2013, 31.03.2014 and 31.03.2015. It was also stated that, in the meantime, Respondent No.1 had approached the Division Bench against the Single Bench by instituting LPA No.1391 of 2012, leading to the Impugned . 12. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the simple and basic issue was the payment of royalty, as agreed to and accepted by the parties. It was stated that payments were also made, which now have been given the colour of being demand/imposition of tax, which, learned counsel contended, is absolutely not the case. It was urged that the only issue, which at best could have been gone into by the High Court, was with regard to the quantum of enhancement from Re.1 per square foot to Rs.10 per square foot, but the imposition, on the head of “royalty”, could not have been termed as “imposition of tax”, as admittedly borne out from the record itself. It was further advanced that charge of royalty by the Corporation was also in terms of an agreement entered into between the parties, which was admitted by them in appellate proceedings before the Division Bench. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1389 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v. M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. 13. Learned counsel submitted that “royalty” and “tax” have different connotations in law and royalty, unlike tax, is not based on any statutory provision, but on agreement between the parties. Further, it was stated that the enhancement of the rate of royalty to Rs.10 per square foot from Re.1 per square foot, notified under Office dated 02.11.2007 was challenged by the Respondent No.1 only in the year 2012. By its advertisement issued on 15.01.2007, the Corporation came out with fresh rates of royalty on advertisements which were accepted by the Respondent No.1 and were made effective from 02.11.2007 at the rate of Rs.10 per square foot. 14. Learned counsel in support of the above has relied upon the decisions of this Court in Indsil Hydro Power and Manganese Limited v State of Kerala (2021) 10 SCC 165, the relevant being Paragraphs 50 to 56;2 Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company Ltd. 2 ‘50. In State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. [State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (2004) 10 SCC 201] , another Constitution Bench of this Court explained certain observations in India Cement Ltd. v. State of T.N. [India Cement Ltd. v. State of T.N. (1990) 1 SCC 12] , and stated as under : (Kesoram Industries case [State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (2004) 10 SCC 201] , SCC pp. 293-95 & 297, paras 59-61 & 71) “59. First we will refer to certain dictionaries oft-cited in courts of law: Words and Phrases, Permanent Edn. (Vol. 37-A, p. 597): ‘“Royalty” is the share of the produce reserved to owner for permitting another to exploit and use property.
