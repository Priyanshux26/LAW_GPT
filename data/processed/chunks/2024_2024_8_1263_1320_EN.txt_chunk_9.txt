21 [2020] 9 SCR 472 : (2021) 2 SCC 317 22 lA No. 202 of 2021 in CP/1140/IB/20181. 1276 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports D. ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL FOR THE AUCTION PURCHASER 14. Rebutting the submissions made by learned counsel for the appellant, Mr. Arvind Datar, Senior Advocate appearing for the Auction Purchaser submitted that the time to complete all actions under the IBC stood extended from 15th March, 2020 onwards in view of the Covid-19 circulars and s passed by this Court in the Suo Motu Writ Petition23 initiated by this Court read in conjunction with Regulation 47A of IBBI Regulations, 2016. Therefore, there was no default on the part of the Auction Purchaser in making payment of the balance sale consideration at a later date. Referring to the decision of this Court in GPR Power Solutions Private Limited (supra) learned senior counsel submitted that the extension s were applied by this Court even to submissions of claims by creditors to the resolution professionals. For this reason, it would be erroneous to state that extension could apply only to litigants before courts and Tribunals, as sought to be urged by the other side. The decisions in Standard Surfa Chem India Private Limited v. Kishore Gopal Somani24 and Prakash Chandra Kapoor v. Vijay Kumar Iyer 25 were cited by learned counsel to argue that timelines prescribed under the IBBI Regulations, 2016 are directory and not mandatory in character. Learned counsel submitted that reliance placed by the appellant on C.N. Paramasivam (supra) to contend that the timeline of 90 days is absolute, is misplaced for the reason that the provisions governing the Debt Recovery Tribunal26 and the Adjudicating Authority are not pari materia. Learned senior counsel submitted that unlike DRT’s, Adjudicating Authority has special inherent powers under Rule 11 of the National Company Law Tribunal Rules, 2016.27 Furthermore, even in cases initiated under the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act,28 this Court had granted extension to an Auction Purchaser to deposit the balance sale consideration in view of the Covid-19 lockdown 23 Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) No.3 of 2020 in ‘Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In Re’, reported as (2020) 19 SCC 10 24 2022 SCC Online NCLAT 305 25 2021 SCC Online NCLAT 622 26 For short ‘DRT’ 27 For short ‘NCLT Rules, 2016’ 28 For short ‘SARFAESI Act’ [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1277 V.S. Palanivel v. P. Sriram, CS, Liquidator, Etc. situation. For this, learned senior counsel referred to the dated 12th May, 202029 passed by this Court in Union Bank of India v. Rajat Infrastructure Private Limited and Others.30 Similarly, he submitted that the Sagufa Ahmed case (supra) referred to on behalf of the appellant, cannot apply to the facts of the instant case for the reason that in the captioned case, the timeline for filing an appeal before the Tribunal had expired before 15th March, 2020, which was not so here as the timeline for the Auction Purchaser to deposit the balance sale consideration had expired after declaration of the COVID-19 lockdown by the Government of India on 22nd March, 2020.
