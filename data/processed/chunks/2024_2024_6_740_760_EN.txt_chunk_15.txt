32. When there are more than one dying declaration, this Court in Amol Singh vs. State of Madhya Pradesh6, clarified that it is not the plurality of the dying declarations that matter. On the contrary, it is the reliability of a dying declaration which is significant. If there are inconsistencies between one dying declaration and the other, the court has to examine the nature of the inconsistencies, i.e., whether those are material or not. 33. In Lakhan vs. State of Madhya Pradesh7, this Court held that where there are multiple dying declarations with inconsistencies between them, the court would have to scrutinize the facts very carefully and, thereafter, take a decision as to which of the declarations is worth reliance. 4 [2008] 2 SCR 959 : (2008) 4 SCC 265 5 [2012] 7 SCR 128 : (2012) 7 SCC 569 6 [2008] 8 SCR 956 : (2008) 5 SCC 468 7 [2010] 9 SCR 705 : (2010) 8 SCC 514 760 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 34. Again, in Ashabai vs. State of Maharashtra8, this Court observed that when there are multiple dying declarations, each dying declaration has to be separately assessed and evaluated independently on their own merit as to the evidentiary value of each. One cannot be rejected merely because of certain variations in the other. 35. As already discussed above, there is no reason for us to doubt the correctness of the dying declaration of the deceased (Ex. 59) which has been proved in evidence. Attending doctor has certified that the deceased was capable of narrating her statement. The substance of the dying declaration is also borne out by the medical history of the patient recorded by the doctor which has also been proved in evidence. Further, though there are inconsistencies and improvements in the version of the prosecution witnesses, there is however convergence with the core of the narration of the deceased made in the dying declaration and the medical history recorded by the doctor. That being the position, the evidence on record, particularly Ex. 59, clearly establishes the guilt of the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt. 36. We are mindful of the fact that appellant is on bail since the year 2016. Nevertheless, having sieved through the evidence carefully, we have no hesitation in our mind that appellant is guilty of committing the offence and that the guilt has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. 37. In view of the above, the appeal is dismissed. Appellant is directed to surrender before the trial court within a period of two weeks from today to carry out his sentence.
