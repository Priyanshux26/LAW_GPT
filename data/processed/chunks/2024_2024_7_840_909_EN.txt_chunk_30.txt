Reliance is also placed on the of this Court in NTPC Ltd. v. Siemens Atkeingesellschaft [NTPC Ltd. v. Siemens Atkeingesellschaft (2007) 4 SCC 451], wherein it was held that the Arbitral Tribunal would deal with limitation under Section 16 of the 1996 Act. If the tribunal finds that the claim is a dead one, or that the claim was barred by limitation, the adjudication of these issues would be on the merits of the claim. Under sub-section (5) of Section 16, the tribunal has the obligation to decide the plea; and if it rejects the plea, the arbitral proceedings would continue, and the tribunal would make the award. Under sub-section (6) a party aggrieved by such an arbitral award may challenge the award under Section 34. […]” (Emphasis supplied) 81. In Union of India v. Pradeep Vinod Construction Company reported in 2019 INSC 1241 this Court left the issue of “accord and satisfaction” to be decided by the arbitrator and held thus: “16. […] On behalf of the Respondent, it has been seriously disputed that issuance of “No Claim” certificate as to the supplementary agreement recording accord and satisfaction as on 06.05.2014 (CA No. 6400/2016) and issuance of “No Claim” certificate on 28.08.2014 (CA No. 6420/2016) that they were issued under compulsion and due to undue influence by the railway authorities. We are not inclined to go into the merits of the contention of the parties. It is for the arbitrator to consider the claim of the 884 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Respondent(s) and the stand of the Appellant-railways. This contention raised by the parties are left open to be raised before the arbitrator.” 82. Thereafter, a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Vidya Drolia & Ors v. Durga Trading Corporation reported in (2021) 2 SCC 1 extensively dealt with the scope of powers of the referral court under Section 8 and 11 respectively of the Act, 1996. It held, inter alia, that Sections 8 and 11 of the Act, 1996 are complementary to each other and thus the aspect of ‘existence’ of the arbitration agreement, as specified under Section 11 should be seen along with its ‘validity’ as specified under Section 8. This Court also held that the exercise of power of prima facie judicial review to examine the existence of arbitration agreement also includes going into the validity of the arbitration agreement and this does not go against the principles of competence-competence and the presumption of separability. It further held that the prima facie review of the aspects related to non-arbitrability may also be undertaken. The relevant observations are extracted hereinbelow: “147.4. Most jurisdictions accept and require prima facie review by the court on non-arbitrability aspects at the referral stage. 147.5. Sections 8 and 11 of the Arbitration Act are complementary provisions as was held in Patel Engg. Ltd. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd. (2005) 8 SCC 618] The object and purpose behind the two provisions is identical to compel and force parties to abide by their contractual understanding.
