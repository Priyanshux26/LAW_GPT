[2023] 4 S.C.R. 1 1 STATE OF RAJASTHAN A v. ASHARAM @ ASHUMAL (Criminal Appeal No. 1156 of 2023) APRIL 17, 2023 B [SANJIV KHANNA AND M. M. SUNDRESH, JJ.] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.391 – High Court allowed the application filed by the respondent u/s.391 of Cr.P.C., directing summoning and recording of evidence of one DCP, who C wrote a book “Gunning for the Godman:The True story behind Asaram Bapu’s conviction” – In the said book, DCP disclosed that he had recorded a video of the scene of the crime (i.e. Kutiya) on his mobile phone on 21.08.2013, which is the day prior to the drawing of the site maps on 22.08.2013 – It was alleged that the victim was tutored based on the videography of the scene of the D crime a day prior to the preparation of the spot panchnama and site maps on 22.08.2013 – Therefore, assertions were made that site maps (Exhibits P-13 and P-14) were false and ought to be discarded – On appeal, held: It is not the prosecution’s case and version that police team/officers had not visited the place of E occurrence or scene of crime on 21.08.2013 – Presence of police team on 21.08.2013 is not disputed and it is an accepted position – The findings recorded by the trial Court is based on detailed examination of the evidence of the victim and investigating officer – Whether finding is correct will be tested in the appeal – When the prosecution states that on 21.08.2013 the police team had visited F the scene of the crime, that is, the ‘Kutiya’, the plea to examine DCP on the ground that he had purportedly recorded a video of the ‘Kutiya’ on his mobile phone is completely inconsequential and irrelevant – The impugned is unsustainable and mistaken in both facts and law and the reasoning is based upon mere G conjectures, and that too without appreciating the scope and object of s. 391 Cr.P.C. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 391 – Additional evidence at appellate stage – The touchstone of when the additional evidence at the appellate stage may be taken on record is not the H 1 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A impossibility or inability to pronounce the in its absence, but whether there would be a failure of justice without such additional evidence – This discretion is not to be exercised lightly but requires caution and care. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 311, 391 – B Comparative analysis – Both s. 311 and 391 relate to power of the court to take additional evidence; the former at the stage of trial and before the is pronounced; and the latter at the appellate stage after by the trial court has been pronounced – The discretion u/s. 391 should be read as somewhat more restricted in comparison to s. 311 as the appellate court is dealing with an appeal, C after the trial court has come to the conclusion with regard to the guilt or otherwise of the person being prosecuted – Further, the appellate court can examine the evidence in depth and in detail, yet it does not possess all the powers of the trial court as it deals with cases wherein the decision has already been pronounced.
