D Explanation.—For the purposes of clause (a), the expression “son”, “grandson” or “great- grandson” shall be deemed to refer to the son, grandson or great-grandson, as the case may be, who was born or adopted prior to the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005. E (5) Nothing contained in this section shall apply to a partition, which has been effected before the 20th day of December, 2004.” Explanation.- For the purposes of this section “partition” F means any partition made by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908) or partition effected by a decree of a court.” 59. Before we proceed to discuss the dictum, as laid by this Court in Vineeta Sharma (supra) we must look into the decision of this Court G in the case of Ganduri Koteshwaramma (supra). In Ganduri Koteshwaramma (supra) this Court, in paras 11, 12, 13 & 14 resply, observed as under: “11. The new Section 6 provides for parity of rights in the coparcenary property among male and female members of a H joint Hindu family on and from 9-9-2005. The legislature has PRASANTA KUMAR SAHOO & ORS. v. CHARULATA SAHU 53 & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] now conferred substantive right in favour of the daughters. A According to the new Section 6, the daughter of a coparcener becomes a coparcener by birth in her own rights and liabilities in the same manner as the son. The declaration in Section 6 that the daughter of the coparcener shall have same rights and liabilities in the coparcenary property as she would have B been a son is unambiguous and unequivocal. Thus, on and from 9-9-2005, the daughter is entitled to a share in the ancestral property and is a coparcener as if she had been a son. 12. The right accrued to a daughter in the property of a joint C Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law, by virtue of the 2005 Amendment Act, is absolute, except in the circumstances provided in the proviso appended to sub-section (1) of Section 6. The excepted categories to which new Section 6 of the 1956 Act is not applicable are two, namely, (i) where the disposition or alienation including any partition has taken D place before 20-12-2004; and (ii) where testamentary disposition of property has been made before 20-12-2004. Sub-section (5) of Section 6 leaves no room for doubt as it provides that this section shall not apply to the partition which has been effected before 20-12-2004. For the purposes of E new Section 6 it is explained that “partition” means any partition made by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908 or partition effected by a decree of a court. In light of a clear provision contained in the Explanation appended to sub-section (5) of Section 6, for determining the non-applicability of the section, F what is relevant is to find out whether the partition has been effected before 20-12-2004 by deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908 or by a decree of a court.
