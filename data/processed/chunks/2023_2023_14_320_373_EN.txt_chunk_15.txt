Kamalam Kumaresan and Ors, SLP © 14176-14177 of 2016 27 Submitted by Shri K. Radhakrishnan, Senior Advocate on behalf of the Respondents in Revanasiddappa and Anr v. Mallikarjun and Ors, C.A No. 2844 of 2011 28 Submitted by Mrs V. Mohana, Senior Advocate on behalf of the Respondents in Baby @ Rohini (Since Deceased) through her legal heirs & Ors v. Kamalam Kumaresan and Ors, SLP © 14176-14177 of 2016 342 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. d. The Legislature has intervened multiple times to address inheritance rights of legitimised children: i. Initial HMA Provision (Section 16): The enactment of the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) included Section 16, establishing children from void or voidable marriages as legitimate children their parents. ii. 1976 Amendment to Section 16: In 1976, Section 16 of the HMA was amended to rectify issues causing discrimination. iii. HSA Amendment (Section 6(3)): Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act (HSA) was amended, introducing Section 6(3) that enforces notional partition of parents’ undivided interest in coparcenary property.29 Thus, there is no legislative vacuum as far as the rights of the children born out of void or voidable marriages are concerned. As such, judicial intervention to broaden the scope of the rights of such children is not warranted. e. Through various amendments, Parliament has ensured that these children possess inheritance rights within the scope of their parents’ property.30 This process has converted inherited property into the parents’ self-acquired property, thereby enabling legitimate children to utilize the benefi ts outlined in Section 16 of the HMA. In such instances, the Parliament’s interventions were aimed at reconciling the Mitakshara Law with the evolving considerations of public policy, thereby striking a balance between safeguarding the interests of these children and other coparceners.31 29 Submitted by Mr Vivek Chib, Senior Advocate on behalf of the Respondents No. 71 and 81 in Baby @ Rohini (Since Deceased) Rep by her Legal Representatives and Ors v Kamalam Kumaresan and Ors, SLP (C) No. 14176-14177 of 2016 30 Submitted by Mrs V.

Union of India33, which demonstrates how legislative actions and amendments consistently address potential legal voids, ensuring no gaps in the law concerning the inheritance rights of all legitimate Children.
