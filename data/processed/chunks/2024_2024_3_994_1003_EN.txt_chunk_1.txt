[Paras 5, 7, 9] Suits – ‘SLAPP Suits’– Concept of : Held: Term ‘SLAPP’ stands for ‘Strategic Litigation against Public Participation’ – It is an umbrella term used to refer to litigation predominantly initiated by entities that wield immense economic power against members of the media or civil society, to prevent the public from knowing about or participating in important affairs in the public interest – Grant of an interim injunction, before the trial commences, often acts as a ‘death sentence’ to the material sought to be published, well before the allegations have been proven – While granting ad-interim injunctions in defamation suits, the potential of using prolonged litigation to prevent free speech and public participation must also be kept in mind by courts.
