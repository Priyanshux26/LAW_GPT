Section 10 of the 1957 Act also underwent legislative change. Prior to its amendment, it was as follows: “Section 10. Offi cers and members of the Force to be deemed to be Railway Servants.- The Inspector General and any other superior offi cer and every member of the Force shall for all purposes be regarded as Railway Servant within the meaning of the Indian Railway Act, 1890 other than Chapter VI-A thereof, and shall be entitled to exercise the powers conferred on Railway Servants by or under that Act.” (Emphasis supplied) 47. By Act No. 60 of 1985, Section 10 was amended, with eff ect from 20.09.1985, to read as follows: 676 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. “Section 10.

Section 19 of the 1957 Act, prior to its amendment made by Act No. 60 of 1985, was as follows: “Section 19. Certain Acts not to apply to members of Force.- Nothing contained in the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 or the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 or the Factories Act, 1948, shall apply to members of the Force.” 49. Post amendment, brought by Act No. 60 of 1985, with eff ect from 20.09.1985, Section 19 of the 1957 Act reads as follows: “Section 19. Certain Acts not to apply to members of Force.- Nothing contained in the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 (4 of 1936) or the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947) or the Factories Act, 1948 (63 of 1948) or any corresponding law relating to investigation and settlement of industrial dispute in force in a State shall apply to members of the Force.” Issue No. (i): Whether provisions of the 1923 Act applies to a member of the RPF 50. Having examined the relevant statutory provisions, we shall now address the issue no. (i) noted above. 51. The 1923 Act as it stood at the relevant time (i.e., the date of the accident out of which the claim has arisen) was an Act to provide for the payment by certain class of employers to their workman, compensation for injury by accident. Section 3 of the 1923 Act, as it stood at the time of the accident in question, provided that if personal injury is caused to a workman by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, his employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the provision of Chapter II of the 1923 Act.
