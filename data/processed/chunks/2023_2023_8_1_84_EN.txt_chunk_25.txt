Our attention was drawn to various s. They include Energy Watchdog v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and Others (2017) 14 SCC 80, Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd. &Anr. v. Adani Power Limited C &Ors. (2019) 5 SCC 325, Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. v. Essar Power (2008) 4 SCC 755, Skandia Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Kokilaben Chandravan & Ors. (1987) 2 SCC 654, DLF Universal Limited v. Director, Town and Country Planning Department, Haryana (2010) 14 SCC 1 and Sumitomo Heavy Industries v. Oil and Natural Gas Commission of India (2010) 11 SCC 296, Nabha Power Limited v. D PSPCL (2018) 11 SCC 508. (29) The respondents have also relied upon the s of this Court which are detailed hereinafter essentially for the proposition that there is power under XLI Rule 22 and Rule 33:Prahlad&Ors. v. State of Maharashtra &Anr. (2010) 10 SCC 458, State of Punjab E &Ors. v. Bakshish Singh (1998) 8 SCC 222, Mahant Dhangir & Anr. v. Madan Mohan &Ors. (1987) (Supp) SCC 528. (30) It is contended by Mr. Sajjan Povayya, learned senior counsel that there is indeed power, at any rate, under the provisions of Section 79(1)(b) of the Act to revisit the fixation of tariff de hors even the F specific relief which is contemplated under the contract. In this regard, emphasis is laid on the fact that clauses 4.7 and 5.1.17 of the guidelines came to be amended and it is the amended guidelines which apply to the facts of the case. That it is the amended guidelines which were applied can be perceived from the fact that the amended guidelines are seen G reflected in the PPA. The amended provisions are found in 17.3.1 and 13.1.1 (31) Amended Guideline 4.7 is reflected in 13.1.1 whereas amended guideline 5.17 is reflected in Article 17.3.1. (32) With regard to 17.3.1, it is pointed out that a reading of the H same, in particular, the opening limb of the provision would show that HARYANA POWER PURCHASE CENTRE v. SASAN POWER 37 LTD. & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] there is clearly general power for the purpose of changing determiningor A increasing the tariff. It is sought to be contrasted with specific instances which would notify the jurisdiction of the Commission which included Article 13.1 which deals with change in law. In other words, the contention is that de hors a change in law, it becomes the duty of the Commission and the Tribunal and of this Court to factor in the need to arm the Tribunal B and the Commission with ample power in the interest of justice, to deal with situations which call out for a fair and equitable treatment to be meted out to the private player as well in a long term contract. (33) Mr. Amit Kapoor, learned counsel, who supplemented the submissions of Mr. Sajjan Poovayya, learned senior counsel, would draw C our attention to Section 61 of the Act. He would submit that Section 61 read with Sections 63 to 79(b) provided a statutory framework which enabled the Commission to devise an equitable tariff even in a PPA governed scenario having regard to the very nature of the services involved and the changed system evolved under the Act.
