Before something amounts to an of the State Government, two things are necessary. First, the has to be expressed in the name of the Governor as required by 19 Mahadeo v. Sovan Devi 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1118. 640 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. clause (1) of Article 166 and second, it has to be communicated. As already indicated, no formal modifying the decision of the Revenue Secretary was ever made. Until such an is drawn up, the State Government cannot, in our opinion, be regarded as bound by what was stated in the fi le.” Similarly, the decision of this Court in Bachhittar Singh v. State of Punjab20 which is cited in the above reproduced paragraph notes:– “9. The question, therefore, is whether he did in fact make such an . Merely writing something on the fi le does not amount to an . Before something amounts to an of the State Government two things are necessary. The has to be expressed in the name of the Governor as required by clause (1) of Article 166 and then it has to be communicated. As already indicated, no formal modifying the decision of the Revenue Secretary was ever made. Until such an is drawn up the State Government cannot, in our opinion, be regarded as bound by what was stated in the fi le. As long as the matter rested with him the Revenue Minister could well score out his remarks or minutes on the fi le and write fresh ones.” 53. We, therefore, have no reason to doubt that the assignment took place only on 21.10.1961, i.e. when the Temporary Pattas were issued. We also wish to highlight that the observation in the High Court dated 21.04.2006, that the Assignees were in possession since 1953 is an ex-facie mistake of fact in light of the documents brought on record as none of them supports this stance, including the explanations submitted in response to the SCNs wherein the Assignees themselves have stated that possession was given to them in 1960. However, we hasten to add that since the assignment would be governed by the legal regime as applicable on 21.10.1961, the aforementioned factually incorrect observation made by the High Court in respect of the date of taking possession of the Subject Land by Assignees is inconsequential. 54. Once it is determined that the regulatory regime which was in vogue and held the fi eld as on 21.10.1961 will govern the assignments, 20 Bachhittar Singh v. State of Punjab AIR 1963 SC 395. YADAIAH AND ANR. v. STATE OF TELANGANA AND 641 OTHERS [SURYA KANT, J.] then it also stands crystalised that the 1958 Circular as well as GOM 1122 being in force at that time, are clearly applicable to the Subject Land. The 1958 Clarifi cation which discounts the application of 1958 Circular is not attracted in view of proviso to Rule 7(a) as each of the Assignees in the present case was granted around 7 Acres 6 Guntas of land for cultivation which is much is more than the limit of “6 acres of dry or 2-1/2 acres of wet land” being the perquisite for application of the 1958 Clarifi cation.
