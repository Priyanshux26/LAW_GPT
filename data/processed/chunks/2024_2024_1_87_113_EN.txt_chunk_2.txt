DIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS confessional statement made by him is declared not provable, and does not predicate a condition of that person at the time of making the statement. [Para 26] Criminal Law – Appellant was accused of the murder of his Uncle and his son – Acquitted in the case relating to the murder of Uncle – of acquittal – Evidentiary value, if any: Held: Except for the fact that the appellant was taken into custody during the course of investigation for the murder of his Uncle and thereupon his disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) was recorded, there is no connection between the two offences – Murders were committed on two different dates – Murder trial of his Uncle was primarily based upon an entirely different set of evidence – Conviction of the appellant is sustainable in view of the evidence placed on record in the present case – The of acquittal would not qualify as relevant and of evidentiary value so as to acquit the appellant in the present case. [Para 42] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant, convicted – Acquittal of the co- accused – Application of s.27: Held: Acquittal of the co-accused was for want of evidence against them – At best, they were found in possession of the articles connected with the crime on the basis of the disclosure statement (Exhibit P-37) made by the appellant – s.27 of the Evidence Act could not have been applied to the other co-accused as the provision pertains to information that distinctly relates to the discovery of a ‘fact’ that was previously unknown, as opposed to fact already disclosed or known – Once information is given by an accused, the same information cannot be used, even if voluntarily made by a co-accused who is in custody – s.27 does apply to joint disclosures, but this is not one such case – This was precisely the reason given by the trial court to acquit the co-accused – Further, even if Section 8 of the Evidence Act was to apply, it would not have been possible to convict the co-accused – The trial court rightly held other co-accused not guilty. [Para 43] Evidence – Case based on circumstantial evidence – Five golden principles to be satisfied as laid down in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra [1985] 1 SCR 88 – Conditions to be fulfilled before the false explanation or a false defence can be used by the Court as an additional link to lend an assurance to the court, stated – A distinction has [2024] 1 S.C.R. 91 PERUMAL RAJA @ PERUMAL v. STATE, REP. BY INSPECTOR OF POLICE to be drawn between incomplete chain of circumstances and a circumstance after a chain is complete and the defence or explanation given by the accused is found to be false, in which event the said falsehood is added to reinforce the conclusion of the court. [Paras 37, 38] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.313: Held: Appellant in his statement u/s.313 denied all accusations without furnishing any explanation regarding his knowledge of the places from which the dead body was recovered – The failure of the appellant to present evidence on his behalf or to offer any cogent explanation regarding the recovery of the dead body by virtue of his special knowledge must lead to a reasonable adverse inference, by application of the principle u/s.106 of the Evidence Act thus forming an additional link in the chain of circumstances – The additional link further affirms the conclusion of guilt as indicated by the prosecution evidence.
