Recently, the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Vivek Narayan Sharma v. Union of India [2023 SCC OnLine D SC 1] has held that the Courts should be slow in interfering with the decisions taken by the experts in the field and unless it is found that the expert bodies have failed to take into consideration the mandatory statutory provisions or the decisions taken are based on extraneous considerations or they are ex facie arbitrary and illegal, it will not be appropriate for this Court to substitute its E views with that of the expert bodies.” 130. As is indicated in the aforesaid s, this Court should be slow in interfering with the concurrent findings of fact unless they are found to be perverse, arbitrary and either in ignorance of or contrary to the statutory provisions. F V. CONCLUSION 131. In the light of our aforesaid findings, we will now consider each of the appeals independently. Civil Appeal No. 11095 of 2018 and Civil Appeal Nos. 11910- G 11911 of 2018 132. In these batch of appeals, insofar as the appeal of DNH- DISCOM is concerned, they are aggrieved by the of the learned APTEL allowing Busy Season Surcharge and Development Surcharge, MoEF Notification on coal quality and Change in NCDP. They are also H 232 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A aggrieved by the finding of the learned APTEL with regard to carrying cost. 133. Insofar as the compensation on the ground of Change in NCDP is concerned, as already discussed, the same is squarely covered by the of this Court in the case of MSEDCL v. APML & Ors. B (supra) 134. Insofar as the Busy Season Surcharge and Development Surcharge are concerned, they are issued under the Circulars/Notifications of Indian Railways. The notification on coal quality is issued by MoEF. All these are the instrumentalities of the State, and these would, therefore, amount to ‘Change in Law’. C 135. Insofar as rest of the claims, which are concurrently allowed and disallowed by both the CERC and the learned APTEL, are concerned, in view of the s of this Court on this issue, as stated above, we do not find any reason to interfere with the same, not noticing any perversity, arbitrariness and/or any contravention of the statutory D provisions. The appeals of both the Generator and the DNH-DISCOM are, therefore, liable to be dismissed. Civil Appeal Nos.4628-4629 of 2021 136. The learned APTEL allowed the claim of the Generator only on the ground of Busy Season Surcharge and Development Surcharge E on transportation of coal, and the Carrying Cost. 137. In view of our finding on the issues as above, no error can be found with the finding of the learned APTEL in that regard. We find no merit in the appeals. The appeals are, accordingly, liable to be dismissed. Civil Appeal Nos. 12055-12056 of 2018 F 138. The issue of Busy Season Surcharge, Development Surcharge and Port Congestion Surcharge have already been considered by us herein above.
