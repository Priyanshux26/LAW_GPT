[Paras 11.1, 12] Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 – s.37 and s.52 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.437(3) – Application of CrPC to the arrests made under NDPS: Held: Under Section 37 of the NDPS Act, the Court’s power to grant bail is constrained by Sub-section 1(b)(ii) – However, once a case is made out for a grant of bail in accordance with Section 37, the conditions of bail will have to be in terms of Section 437(3) of the CrPC – The reason is that because of Section 52 of the NDPS Act, the provisions of the CrPC apply to the arrests made under the NDPS Act insofar as they are not inconsistent with the NDPS Act. [Para 4.1] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 99 Frank Vitus v. Narcotics Control Bureau & Ors. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.437(3) – Meaning of the words “interest of justice”: Held: A broader meaning cannot be assigned to the words “interest of justice” in Section 437(3) of CrPC – By borrowing the language used by the Supreme Court in its earlier decisions, it is clear that the bail conditions cannot be fanciful, arbitrary or freakish – The object of imposing conditions of bail is to ensure that the accused does not interfere or obstruct the investigation in any manner, remains available for the investigation, does not tamper with or destroy evidence, does not commit any offence, remains regularly present before the Trial Court, and does not create obstacles in the expeditious conclusion of the trial – The conditions incorporated in the granting bail must be within the four corners of Section 437(3) – The bail conditions must be consistent with the object of imposing conditions – While imposing bail conditions, the Constitutional rights of an accused, who is ed to be released on bail, can be curtailed only to the minimum extent required – Even an accused convicted by a competent Court and undergoing a sentence in prison is not deprived of all his rights guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution.
