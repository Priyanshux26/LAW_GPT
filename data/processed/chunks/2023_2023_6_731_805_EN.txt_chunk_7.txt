However, each member of the class that would be impacted by a policy decision cannot be afforded an B opportunity of hearing. This would not only be time consuming and expensive, but deeply impractical. [Para 86][789-G; 790-A- B] 6.5 The absence of a right to be heard before the formulation or implementation of a policy does not mean that affected parties C are precluded from challenging the policy in a court of law. What it means is that a policy decision cannot be struck down on the ground that it was arrived at without offering the members of the public at large (or some section of it) an opportunity to be heard. The challenge to a policy may be sustainable if it is found to vitiate constitutional rights or is otherwise in breach of a mandate of D law. Thus, the decision to abolish the OAT cannot be assailed on the ground that there was a violation of the principles of natural justice. Article 14 of the Constitution has not been violated.

B Union Government did not become functus officio after establishing the OAT 7.1 The doctrine of functus officio gives effect to the principle of finality. Once a judge or a quasi-judicial authority has rendered a decision, it is not open to her to revisit the decision C and amend, correct, clarify, or reverse it (except in the exercise of the power of review, conferred by law). Once a judicial or quasi- judicial decision attains finality, it is subject to change only in proceedings before the appellate court. [Para 92][791-G-H] 7.2 The doctrine of functus officio exists to provide a clear D point where the adjudicative process ends and to bring quietus to the dispute. Without it, decision-making bodies such as courts could endlessly revisit their decisions.
