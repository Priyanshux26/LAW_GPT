The analysis of the evidence is on the basis of what the Fast Track Court had recorded and arrived at its findings. The same has been reproduced in various sub-paras and consequently, the appeal has been dismissed. 14. We find that the High Court ought to have considered the evidence on record in light of the arguments advanced at the bar and thereafter ascertained whether the Fast Track Court was justified in passing the of conviction and imposing the sentence. The same being absent in the impugned , for that sole reason, we set aside the same. We remand the matter to the High Court and restore the CRA 111/2019 on the file of the High Court. We request the High Court to rehear the appeal and pass a fresh , bearing in mind the observations we have made above, in accordance with law. 15. The appeal is allowed and disposed of in the aforesaid terms. 16. Learned counsel for the appellant at this stage submitted that the appellant had the benefit of bail before the Fast Track Court as well as during the consideration of his appeal before the High Court. Therefore, this Court may pass an of suspension of sentence pending disposal of the appeal by the High Court. We do not think at 1272 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports this stage, we could consider the said contention, instead, we reserve liberty to the appellant herein to make an appropriate application seeking suspension of sentence, if so advised. 17. It is needless to observe that if such an application is made, the same shall be considered as expeditiously as possible and in accordance with law. 18. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal Allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Gaurav Upadhyay, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Abhinav Mukerji, Sr. Adv.)
