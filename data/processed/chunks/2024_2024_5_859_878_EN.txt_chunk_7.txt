That apart, it is to be noted that the appellate court while exercising jurisdiction under 41 Rule 5 of the Code did have power to put the appellant tenant on terms. The tenant having suffered an for eviction must comply and vacate the premises. His right of appeal is statutory but his prayer for grant of 870 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports stay is dealt with in exercise of equitable discretionary jurisdiction of the appellate court. While ing stay the appellate court has to be alive to the fact that it is depriving the successful landlord of the fruits of the decree and is postponing the execution of the for eviction. There is every justification for the appellate court to put the appellant tenant on terms and direct the appellant to compensate the landlord by payment of a reasonable amount which is not necessarily the same as the contractual rate of rent. In Marshall Sons & Co. (I) Ltd. v. Sahi Oretrans (P) Ltd. [(1999) 2 SCC 325] this Court has held that once a decree for possession has been passed and execution is delayed depriving the -creditor of the fruits of decree, it is necessary for the court to pass appropriate s so that reasonable mesne profits which may be equivalent to the market rent is paid by a person who is holding over the property.” (Emphasis supplied) 17.2 A Bench of three learned Judges in State of Maharashtra & Anr. v.

The way this Court has been looking at the relationship between the landlord and the tenant in the past and the shift in the Court’s approach in recent times have been examined in some detail in the decision in Satyawati Sharma v.

Ashwin Bhanulal Desai An analysis of the s of 1950s to early 1990s would indicate that in majority of cases the courts heavily leaned in favour of an interpretation which would benefit the tenant—Mohinder Kumar v. State of Haryana [(1985) 4 SCC 221] , Prabhakaran Nair v. State of T.N. [(1987) 4 SCC 238], D.C. Bhatia v. Union of India [(1995) 1 SCC 104] and C.N. Rudramurthy v. K. Barkathulla Khan [(1998) 8 SCC 275] . In these and other cases, the Court consistently held that the paramount object of every rent control legislation is to provide safeguards for tenants against exploitation by landlords who seek to take undue advantage of the pressing need for accommodation of a large number of people looking for a house on rent for residence or business in the background of acute scarcity thereof.
