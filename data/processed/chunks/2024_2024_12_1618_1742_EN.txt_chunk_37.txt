The relevant paragraphs of the Borrower’s writ petition referred to above are reproduced hereunder: - “4.28 On 12th June, 2023, Respondent No. 1 has published Sale Notice scheduling auction of the said property on 30th June, 2023 with a Reserve Price of Rs. 105,50,00,000/- . Hereto annexed and marked Exhibit “F” is a copy of the Sale notice dated 12th June, 2023. 4.29 The Petitioners most respectfully submit that without prejudice to their rights and contentions, the sale process was absolutely erroneous in addition to the defects already committed by the Bank as stated herein above. xxx xxx xxx GROUNDS: - xxx xxx xxx n. that the actions on the part of the Respondent as measures under ·provisions of SARF AESI Act are entirely illegal, arbitrary, unreasonable and unjustified; xxx xxx xxx r. that, the E-auction sale notice dated 25th March 2022 which was delivered upon the Petitioners only on 3lst March 2022, whereas the Auction is fixed on 29th April 2022 Thus, there is no clear gap of 30 (thirty) days. Being 1st auction Respondent is duty bound to give clear 30 (thirty) day notice to the Petitioners as per the mandate· of Rule 8(6) read with Rule 9(1) of the SIE Rules. Thus, the impugned e-auction notice dated 25th March 2022 and all further and consequential action become perverse; [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1669 Celir LLP v. Mr. Sumati Prasad Bafna & Ors. s. that, the impugned sale notice dated 25th March 2022 is in violation of Rule 8(7) (b) of SIE Rules. Under Rule 8(7)(b), legislature requires authorized officer to state the “secured debt for recovery of which the property is to be sold”. Perusal of the impugned auction notice, demonstrates that Respondent has recorded alleged outstanding as on 28th February 2022 and failed to state exact outstanding as on the date of sale notice for which the property is getting sold. The amount of dues mentioned in the purported auction· notice is uncertain and vague. In these peculiar circumstances it is more than enough to prove that there is basic and patent illegality in the. entire E-auction proceeding; t. that, as per the mandate of Rule 8(6)(f), mandates of the secured creditor/authorized officer to disclose the encumbrances known to the Respondent. Herein, admittedly the Secured creditor was fully aware about the encumbrances of Rs.2,08,40;362/- (Rupees· Two Crores Eight Lakhs Forty Thousand Three Hundred and Sixty-Two Only) OR Rs.2,53,40,362/- (Rupees Two Crores Fifty-Three Lakhs Forty Thousand Three Hundred and Sixty-Two Only). towards property tax bill which was found pasted by the Respondent during their site visit as, duly recorded in a Bank’s letter dated 14th January 2022. Once, again, Petitioner vide letter dated 17th January 2022 confirmed that the property tax dues are pending and Corporation has pasted the notice for an encumbrance of Rs. 2,53,40,362/- (Rupees Two Crores Fifty-Three Lakhs Forty Thousand Three Hundred and Sixty Two Only); u. that moreover, the Rule 9(10) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rule states that the certificate of sale to be issued by the Authorised Officer shall specifically mention that whether purchaser has purchased the immovable secured asset free from any encumbrance known to the secured creditor or not.
