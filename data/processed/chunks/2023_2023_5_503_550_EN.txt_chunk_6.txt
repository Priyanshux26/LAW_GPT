This became necessary as a result of the requirement of readjustment /delimitation of 90 constituencies of the Legislative Assembly. Therefore, there is no illegality associated with the delimitation /readjustment of Parliamentary constituencies of the Union Territory of J & K undertaken by the Delimitation Commission. [Para 31][542-E-G] F Legality of the appointment of the Delimitation Commission by the Notification of 6th March 2020 3.1. When the impugned notification dated 6th March 2020 constituting the Delimitation Commission requires the G Delimitation Commission to undertake the exercise of the delimitation of Assembly and Parliamentary Constituencies in the Union Territory of J & K, it refers to the exercise of readjustment as provided in sub-section (2) and (3) of Section 62 which is H 512 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A nothing but delimitation exercise contemplated by sub-section (1) of Section 60 due to the reason of the increase in the membership of the Legislative Assembly from 83 to 90. Moreover, the readjustment was necessary to be made on the basis of the census figures of the 2011 census as contemplated by Section 4 and sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the Delimitation Act, 2002 as B amended by clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act. [Para 32][542-H; 544-A-C] 3.2. The Delimitation Act, 2002 contemplates the constitution of only one Delimitation Commission and not more than one. The Delimitation Act, 2002 was made applicable for C the first time to the State of Jammu and Kashmir with effect from 31st October 2019. Even the Delimitation Acts of 1962 and 1972 were not applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. By virtue of the J&K Reorganisation Act, not only provisions of the Delimitation Act, 2002 were made applicable to the Union D Territory of J & K, but a mandatory duty of readjustment of the constituencies in the Union Territory both of the Legislative Assembly and Parliament was entrusted to the Delimitation Commission by sub-Sections (2) and (3) of Section 62. Till 31st October 2019, the Delimitation Commission for the State/Union Territory of J & K under the Delimitation Act, 2002 could not E have been established as the said enactment was not made applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir till then. [Para 33][544-D-E] 3.3. Sub-section (6) of Section 10 of the Delimitation Act, 2002 uses the word “endeavour”. Section 10A of the Delimitation F Act, 2002 itself indicates that the time limit of 31st July 2008 fixed under sub-Section (6) of Section 10 is not sacrosanct as it confers a power on the Hon’ble President to defer the delimitation exercise in a State under certain circumstances. Thus, the time limit provided in sub-section (6) of Section 10 was never intended G to be mandatory. While amending Section 2(f) of the Delimitation Act by the J&K Reorganisation Act, sub-section (6) of Section 10 has not been amended for enlarging the period provided thereunder. However, the intention of the legislature as reflected in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 62 of the J&K H HAJI ABDUL GANI KHAN & ANR.
