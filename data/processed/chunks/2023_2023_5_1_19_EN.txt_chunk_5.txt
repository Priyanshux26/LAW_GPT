1 in the High Court by way of four appeals, being RFA No. 96 of 2012 (pertaining to OS No. 497 of 2006), RFA No. 287 of F 2010 (pertaining to OS No. 181 of 2007), RFA No. 238 of 2014 (pertaining to OS No. 238 of 2012) and RFA No. 247 of 2014 (pertaining to OS No. 293 of 2012). All these four appeals were decided together by the High Court in its common and dated 28.06.2019. 4. As noticed, the present appeal relates only to RFA No. 247 of G 2014 (pertaining to OS No. 293 of 2012). Therefore, dilation on all the factual aspects of the four civil suits and respective findings of the High Court may not be of direct relevance for the present purpose but, for the fact that they relate to cognate mattersand the appeals have been decided by the common , for a comprehension of the views of the High H 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R.
