Thus, obligations and statutory charges were also ‘security interests’. III. LIQUIDATOR’SARGUMENTS B 13. Mr. Arvind Kumar Gupta, learned advocate appearing for the liquidator, argued that under the IBC, creditors were classified either as secured or unsecured. Further, a highlight of the IBC was the distinction between the financial and operational creditors, and their differential treatment with regards to recovery. He submitted that the Bankruptcy C Law Reforms Committee Report,2015 and the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law, stipulate that government dues were not given priority under the IBC. This formed the backdrop of the legislation. In fact, the Statement of Objects and Reasons to the IBC stipulates alteration in the priority of payment of government dues. D 14. It was argued that in terms of Section 52(3), before realization of security interest by secured creditors, the liquidator had to verify the existence of security interest from the records maintained by an information utility or by such other means as may be specified by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (hereinafter, “Board / IBBI”).8 E The existence of a security interest could be proved by a secured creditor in terms of Regulation 21,IBBI (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 (hereinafter, “Liquidation Regulations”). 15. Learned counsel submitted that the registration of any charge was mandatory under Section 77 of the Companies Act, 2013 F (corresponding to Section 125 of the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956). It was highlighted that Section 48 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (hereinafter, “TPA”) dealt with priority of rights, and inter-se priorities amongst creditors prevailed in the distribution of assets in liquidation proceedings.

It was submitted that government dues were placed in the ‘waterfall mechanism’ under Section 53(1)(e)(i) of the IBC. Learned counsel emphasized that even under the old Companies Act, 1956, Section 529A provided priority to the debts due to the secured creditors and the workers, and Section 530 made payment of taxes subject to the priority embodied in Section 529A. Similarly, priority of debts due to secured B creditors and workers was reflected under Section 326 of the Companies Act, 2013.Section 327 made payment of taxes subject to the priority embodied in Section 326. It was urged that Section 26E of the Securitization of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter, “SARFAESI Act”) and Section 31B of the C Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (hereinafter, “RDDBFI Act”) accorded priority to secured creditors over other dues. The Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in Jalgaon Janta Shakari Bank Ltd. v. Joint Commissioner of Sales Tax, Nodal 9, Mumbai & Anr.,11 reinforced the priority accorded to secured creditors under Section 26E of SARFAESI Act.
