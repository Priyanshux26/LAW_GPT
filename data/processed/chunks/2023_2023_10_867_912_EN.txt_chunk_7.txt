[Paras 38 and 39][909-E-F] 1.9 These findings are being returned as the restrictions B on the Court while examining the question of bail under the 1967 Act is less stringent in comparison to the provisions of Section 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This Court is not called upon, for granting a bail to an accused with commercial quantity of contraband article under the 1985 Act, to satisfy ourselves that there are reasonable grounds for C believing that an accused is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. Here, this Court has to satisfy ourselves that the specified offences alleged to have been committed by the appellants cannot be held to be prima facie true. [Para 40][909-G-H; 910-A] D 1.10 In these two proceedings, the appellants have not crossed, as undertrials, a substantial term of the sentence that may have been ultimately imposed against them if the prosecution could establish the charges against them. But the fundamental proposition of law laid down in K.A. Najeeb, that a bail restricting E clause cannot denude the jurisdiction of a Constitutional Court in testing if continued detention in a given case would breach the concept of liberty enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India, would apply in a case where such a bail-restricting clause is being invoked on the basis of materials with prima facie low- probative value or quality. Juxtaposing the appellants’ case F founded on Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India with the aforesaid allegations and considering the fact that almost five years have lapsed since they were taken into custody, the appellants have made out a case for granting bail. Allegations against them no doubt are serious, but for that reason alone bail G cannot be denied to them. While dealing with the offences under Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act, the materials available at this stage cannot justify continued detention of the appellants, pending final outcome of the case under the others provisions of the 1860 Code and the 1967 Act.

State of Maharashtra (2021) 3 SCC 723 – relied on. Jayendra Saraswathi Swamigal v. State of Tamil Nadu (2005) 2 SCC 13 : [2005] 1 SCR 160; State v. Jagjit SinghAIR 1962 SC 253 : [1962] SCR 622; Gurucharan B Singh v. State of (UT of Delhi) (1978) 1 SCC 118 : [1978] 2 SCR 358 – referred to. 1.11 The impugned s are set aside. The appellants be released on bail in respect of the cases(s) out of which the present appeals arise, on such terms and conditions the Special C Court may consider fit and proper, if the appellants or any one of them are not wanted in respect of any other case.
