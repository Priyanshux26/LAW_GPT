Therefore, it was held that the licence fee imposed by the Town Area Committee was ultra vires the 1914 Act: “20. In our opinion, the bye-laws which impose a charge on the wholesale dealer in the shape of the prescribed fee, 109 [1952] 1 SCR 572 : (1952) 1 SCC 205 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1545 Gaurav Kumar v. Union of India and Ors. irrespective of any use or occupation by him of immovable property vested in or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee including any public street, are obviously ultra vires the powers of the respondent Committee and, therefore, the bye-laws cannot be said to constitute a valid law which alone may, under Article 19(6) of the Constitution, impose a restriction on the right conferred by Article 19(1)(g). In the absence of any valid law authorising it, such illegal imposition must undoubtedly operate as an illegal restraint and must infringe the unfettered right of the wholesale dealer to carry on his occupation, trade or business which is guaranteed to him by Article 19(1)(g) of our Constitution.” 100. In Cooverjee B Bharucha v. Excise Commissioner,110 another Constitution Bench held that a licence fee levied without the authority of law was not protected under Article 19(6). In R M Seshadri v. District Magistrate,111 the District Collector imposed a condition compelling the licencee to exhibit at each performance one or more approved films of such length and for such length of time as directed by the Government. The condition was challenged for violation of Article 19(1)(g). A Constitution Bench of this Court observed that the condition was couched in wide language and did not lay down any guideline to the licencing authority. It was held that a “condition couched in such wide language is bound to operate harshly upon the cinema business and cannot be regarded as a reasonable restriction.” 101. We can cull out the following principles from the above discussion: (i) the power of the authority to impose restrictions on the right under Article 19(1)(g) is not absolute and must be exercised in a reasonable manner; (ii) any fees or licences levied by the authorities must be valid and levied on the basis of the authority of law; and (iii) delegated legislation which is contrary to or beyond the scope of the legislative policy laid down by the parent legislation places an unreasonable restriction in violation of Article 19(1)(g).112 110 [1954] 1 SCR 873 : (1954) 1 SCC 18 [9] 111 (1954) 2 SCC 320 112 Minerva Talkies v.

According to the current enrolment fee structure of the SBCs, an advocate has to pay anywhere between Rupees fifteen thousand to Rupees forty-two thousand as a pre-condition to enrolment. As held in the above segments of this , the SBCs charge enrolment fees in excess of the stipulated fee prescribed under Section 24(1)(f). The excess enrolment fee imposed by the SBCs is without authority of law.
