The Respondent No.1 challenged the Trial Court , so far as the same pertained to the Kamla Nagar property, by filing RFA No.439 of 2008 before the High Court whereas the appellants challenged the decision of the Trial Court pertaining to the Malcha Marg property by preferring RFA No.483 of 2008. 4. By the common Impugned Judgement dated 06.12.2013, the High Court allowed the appeal filed by the Respondent No.1 [RFA No.439 of 2008] and dismissed the appeal filed by the appellants [RFA No.483 of 2008]. The instant Civil Appeals emanate therefrom. SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANTS: Re Kamla Nagar: 5. Learned senior counsel for the appellants submitted that the of the Trial Court [the Additional District Judge, Karkardooma Courts, Delhi] dated 28.07.2008 held that Kamla Nagar property belongs solely to the appellants on very cogent grounds i.e., the same was originally joint/ancestral property between RKK and ACK having been bought in the name of TCK and later the 50% share of ACK being bought by the appellants in a family settlement. It was pointed out that when suggestion was put to DW1 and DW2 being Defendant No.2 and LRs of deceased Defendant No.1 respectively, in cross-examination, payment of Rs. 55,000/- (Rupees Fifty-Five Thousand) for betterment of Hindu Undivided Family (hereinafter referred to as “HUF”) was admitted. Further, the Trial Court had noted in its that the plaintiff (Respondent No.1) in his cross-examination had admitted that the Kamla Nagar property was the only joint family property. 6. Learned counsel submitted that the appellants, who were defendants in the suit pertaining to the Kamla Nagar property, had proved that there was an oral settlement in the year 1979 after the demise of RKK and in terms thereof, the LRs of RKK being Defendants No.1, 2 and 3, being sons of RKK, as also Ms. Lakshmi Khanna, wife of late RKK, 842 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports had by 6 cheques paid an amount of Rs. 55,000/- (Rupees Fifty-Five Thousand) towards the share of ACK in the Kamla Nagar property. 7. Thus, it was contended that rightly the Trial Court had held in favour of the appellants that the the Kamla Nagar property no more remained joint family property, as the 50% share of the ACK branch was already bought by paying Rs. 55,000/- (Rupees Fifty- Five Thousand) to the LRs. In support of his contention, learned counsel further submitted that ACK in his Wealth Tax Return of the year 1965-1967 had shown the value of the Kamla Nagar property at around Rs.38,000/- (Rupees Thirty-Eight Thousand) and thus, in the year 1979, the value being Rs.1,10,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and Ten Thousand) was most reasonable and 50% of their share being Rs.55,000/- (Rupees Fifty-Five Thousand) having been paid, the entire property belonged to the share of the LRs of RKK. 8. However, it was contended that even the Trial Court has held that in family settlements, it is normal for the value to be slightly on the upper or the lower side.
