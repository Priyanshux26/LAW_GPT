[Paras 9 and 14] Adverse Possession by State against a Citizen: Held: It is a fundamental principle that the State cannot claim adverse possession over the property of its own citizens – In Vidya Devi v. State of H.P ((2020) 2 SCC 569), this Court emphatically held that the State cannot be permitted to take the plea of adverse possession – Allowing the State to appropriate private property through adverse possession would undermine the constitutional rights of citizens and erode public trust in the government. [Paras 10, 11 and 15] Adverse Possession – Constituents: Held: The appellants' possession, as evidenced by the Misal Hakiyat of 1879-80, was permissive and conditional – Such permissive possession cannot be the basis for a claim of adverse possession – The acts relied upon by the appellants such as placing bitumen drums, erecting temporary structures, and constructing a boundary wall in 1980 do not constitute adverse possession – Adverse possession requires possession that is continuous, open, peaceful, and hostile to the true owner for the statutory period – In this case, the appellants' possession lacks the element of hostility and the requisite duration. [Paras 11 and 12] [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1259 The State of Haryana & Anr. v. Amin Lal (Since Deceased) Through His Lrs & Ors. Jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Held: Appellants’ contention that the High Court overstepped its jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure by reappreciating evidence and interfering with findings of fact has no legs to stand – The High Court found that the First Appellate Court had ignored material evidence and legal principles, leading to a perverse – Therefore, the High Court was justified in exercising its jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure – The High Court's is based on sound legal principles and correct appreciation of evidence.
