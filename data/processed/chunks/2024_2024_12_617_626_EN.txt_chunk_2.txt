Though he was declared successful in the examination vide communication dated 16.04.2018, his name was not approved for promotion and his result was put on hold for further consideration vide notification dated 06.09.2018. Meanwhile, the office of the Postmaster General, East Region, Bihar, ed on 17.08.2018 to change the category of respondent to Scheduled Caste in his Service Book. 6. Finally, the Department of Posts, after consulting the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, ed vide communication dated 14.02.2019 that the respondent was not entitled to the benefit of Scheduled Caste category as he does not belong to scheduled caste and deleted his name from the list of candidates successful in the examination. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid dated 14.02.2019, the respondent filed OA/050/00289/2019 before the Central Administrative Tribunal, which was dismissed on 01.04.2022. 7. The decision of the Tribunal was challenged before the High Court in a Writ Petition and the High Court allowed the same on 19.01.2023 by the impugned before us. The High Court proceeded on the following premise: “9. It is not a case that the State Government has amended the Presidential without any authority of law and has included a particular caste in the category of Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, but the State Government has only deleted one of the most backward castes from the State list on account of the fact that it is a Scheduled Caste already notified in the Presidential and, therefore, to enable them to take the benefit of the Presidential the circular has been issued as a clarification . [2024] 12 S.C.R. 621 Union of India & Ors. v. Rohit Nandan 10. Moreover, the petitioner has been issued a caste certificate of SC category by a competent authority and the same has not been challenged or cancelled. Hence, for all practical purposes, the petitioner is a person belonging to the SC category. 11. In the light of discussion made hereinabove and under the facts and circumstances of the case, the present writ petition deserves to be allowed and is accordingly allowed. The of learned CAT dated 01.04.2022 and the dated 14.02.2019 issued by the respondent no.3 are quashed and set aside.” 8. During the pendency of the appeal before us and after notice was issued by this Court on 25.08.2023, an important development occurred. The very same question was taken up and decided by this Court on 15.07.2024 in Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar (supra). Therein, it has been held that the exercise of taking out ‘Tanti’ from the EBC (‘Extremely Backward Classes’) list issued under the Bihar Reservation of Vacancies in Posts and Services (For Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Act, 1991 and its merger with the Scheduled Caste list is bad, illegal and unsustainable. The relevant portions of the decision are as follows: “36. Having considered the submissions advanced, we have no hesitation in holding that the Resolution dated 01.07.2015 was patently illegal, erroneous as the State Government had no competence/ authority/power to tinker with the lists of Scheduled Castes published under Article 341 of the Constitution.
