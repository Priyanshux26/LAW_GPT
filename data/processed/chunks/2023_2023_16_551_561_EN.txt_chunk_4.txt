Clause (ix) of Section 2 of PFA reads thus: “(ix) “misbranded”—an article of food shall be deemed to be misbranded— (a) if it is an imitation of, or is a substitute for, or resembles in a manner likely to deceive, another article of food under the name of which it is sold, and is not plainly and conspicuously labelled so as to indicate its true character; (b) if it is falsely stated to be the product of any place or country; (c) if it is sold by a name which belongs to another article of food; (d) if it is so coloured, fl avoured or coated, powdered or polished that the fact that the article is damaged is concealed or if the articles is made to appear better or of greater value than it really is; (e) if false claims are made for it upon the label or otherwise; (f) if, when sold in packages which have been sealed or prepared by or at the instance of the manufacturer or producer and which 3 (2020) 10 SCC 751 MANIK HIRU JHANGIANI v.

The corresponding provision under the FSSA is clause (zf) of Section 3 which reads thus: “(zf) “misbranded food” means an article of food– (A) if it is purported, or is represented to be, or is being– (i) offered or promoted for sale with false, misleading or deceptive claims either; (a) upon the label of the package, or (b) through advertisement, or (ii) sold by a name which belongs to another article of food; or (cid:0) ABHAY S.
