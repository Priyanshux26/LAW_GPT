25. In the above backdrop, the foremost issue which arises for our consideration is: STATE OF U.P. & ANR. v. EHSAN & ANR. 919 Whether in exercise of writ jurisdiction the High Court should have refrained from adjudicating the contentious issue with regard to taking of actual possession of the surplus land from the landholder, when the same was not decided in the previous round of litigation even though it had arisen for consideration? 26. Before we proceed further on the aforesaid issue, it would be useful to examine whether at the time of fi ling the third writ petition, the original petitioner had an alternative remedy of a suit to seek appropriate relief for protecting his rights, if any, over the land in dispute. In this regard, we may observe that ordinarily a suit to question the s passed, and consequential notifi cations issued, under the Ceiling Act, 1976 is barred, inasmuch as the Ceiling Act, 1976 is a self-contained Code and any s passed thereunder are subject to statutory appeal etc. For the same reason, a suit may not lie to declare that surplus land, which has been notifi ed as such under Section 10 (3) of the Ceiling Act, 1976, is free from ceiling for failure to take actual possession prior to enforcement of the Repeal Act, 1999. (See: State of M.P. vs. Ghisilal14; Competent Authority, Calcutta, Under The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 and Another vs. David Mantosh and Others15; and Saurav Jain and Another vs. A.B.P. Design and Another16). 27. However, in our view, on the aforesaid principle a suit on the cause of action shown in the third writ petition would not have been barred. Because, here, in the earlier round of litigation (i.e., writ petition No.9702 of 1987), the High Court had already made a declaration that if actual possession of the surplus land has not been taken prior to the cut-off date (i.e., 11.1.1999) specifi ed in the Repeal Act, 1999, the proceedings under the Ceiling Act, 1976 would abate, and if actual possession had been taken by the cut-off date, it will not abate. In view of this conditional declaration, a further declaration in respect of validity of the s passed, and notifi cations issued, under the Ceiling Act, 1976, was not required, therefore a court of competent jurisdiction could have entertained a suit and grant such relief, as 14 (2021) SCC Online SC 1098 15 (2020) 12 SCC 542 16 (2021) SCC Online SC 552 (cid:0) MANOJ MISRA, J. (cid:1) 920 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. may be warranted, dependent on its determination whether actual possession of the surplus land was taken or not, before the cut-off date. In this view of the matter, in our considered view, on the cause of action disclosed in the third writ petition, the fi rst respondent could have instituted a suit to protect his interest, if any, in the land in dispute. 28. We are conscious of the law that existence of an alternative remedy is not an absolute bar on exercise of writ jurisdiction.
