5. Despite the aforesaid proceedings, the appellant (Nabha Power Limited) was not paid the amount and, thus, they fi led Contempt Petition no.1277-1278/2018 (referred to as the ‘First Contempt Petition’) aggrieved by the non-release of payment. This Contempt Petition was tagged with another Contempt Petition No.1766-1767/2018 fi led by Talwandi Sabo Power Limited, the other appellant in one of the appeals before us. The s passed in these Contempt proceedings dated 07.08.2019 and 03.09.2019, respectively, in identical terms, once again dealt with the controversy. By referring to the main pronounced by this Court on 05.10.2017, the Bench came to the conclusion that on reading of the aforesaid, it is made crystal clear by the observed as under: “On a reading of the aforesaid, what becomes clear and what is made crystal clear by the is the fact that, in the formula, both FCOALn and PCVn are costs/ gross calorifi c value of coal which are actual in nature. This being so, when PCVn is spoken of in the formula, it makes it clear that what is referred to is the weighted average gross calorifi c value of coal as received at the project site on actuals thereof, and that includes total moisture content that is measured at the project site. Equally, what is meant in FCOALn in NABHA POWER LIMITED v. PUNJAB STATE POWER 717 CORPORATION LIMITED [SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.] the formula, is the actual cost of purchase of unwashed coal, which would involve the actual grade of unwashed coal that is provided by the coal company to PSPCL. This being the case, we are of the view that the has to be followed, both in letter and in spirit, by working the formula as aforesaid, and consequently, deleting alien fi gures in both numerator and denominator.” 6. The aforesaid would, thus, show that vide dated 07.08.2019 the Court made it abundantly clear that the should be followed in letter and spirit and disposed of the Contempt Petitions with a direction to pay the amount as a result of the within a period of eight weeks from the date of the . Thus, this endeavour of the respondent to delay and cause confusion of the amount to be determined for payment also did not succeed. 7. The appellant addressed a letter dated 07.10.2019 to the respondent, highlighting certain contemptuous actions and called upon the respondent to rectify the computation and pay the dues. Soon thereafter, the respondent filed M.A. No.2396-97/2019 in the First Contempt Petition seeking directions from the Court to have the amounts payable to the appellant to be determined by appropriate authority. The appellant fi led Contempt Petition (C) No.1174-1177/2019 before this Court (referred to as ‘Second Contempt Petition’). 8. On 25.11.2019, M.A. No.2396-97/2019 fi led by the respondent was dismissed while granting further twelve weeks’ time to make payment to the appellant in terms of the dated 05.10.2017. 9. The next development to be noted is that the respondent fi led a subsequent Petition No.25/2019 under Section 86(1)(a) read with Section 62 of the Electricity Act on 24.12.2019 seeking approval of the Regulatory Commission for recovery of the amount paid to the appellant in compliance with the Supreme Court’s dated 07.08.2019 from the consumers by proportionately increasing the retail supply tariff of various categories of the consumers.
