That being the position, the action of the respondents in imposing the penalty without even putting the appellant to notice as regards this proposed E action cannot be approved. [Paras 23][470-A-E] UMC Technologies Private Limited v. Food Corporation of India and Anr. (2021) 2 SCC 551; A.P. State Financial Corporation v. C.M. Ashok Raju and Ors. (1994) 5 SCC 359 : [1994] 1 Suppl. SCR 474 – relied on. F 1.2 Secondly, the authority concerned has proceeded to impose the maximum of penalty to the tune of 10% of the deficit supply without specifying as to why the maximum of penalty was sought to be imposed. In this regard, the relevant factors as indicated by the appellant could not have been ignored altogether. G Unfortunately, the High Court has totally omitted to consider this aspect of the grievance of the appellant. Though, ordinarily, for such an omission of the High Court, the course would have been to remit the issue for consideration but, no useful purpose would H ISOLATORS AND ISOLATORS THR. ITS PROP. MRS. SANDHYA MISHRA 447 v. MPMKVVCL be served by remitting such an issue in this matter. This is for A the simple reason that imposition of penalty against the appellant cannot be approved because of the want of specific show-cause notice. Moreover, no specific quantum of loss has been specified by the respondents so as to justify the imposition of maximum of penalty. [Paras 23.1, 23.2][470-E-G] B 1.3 Even the debarring the appellant for a period of 3 years for default in making the requisite supplies carries its own shortcomings. The appellant had indeed made substantial supplies against the purchase s in question. On 18.09.2019, the respondent No. 2 dealing with the procurement specifically C informed the appellant that the supply under the purchase in question is to be deferred. After such an of deferment, there had not been any other communication or even indication from the respondents which would have informed the appellant to resume supplies. The written submissions on behalf of the respondents do not answer the root question in the matter as to D how the appellant could have been made solely responsible for delay or default in supply after the communication dated 18.09.2019 when the respondents themselves informed the appellant that taking of balance delivery was being deferred (until further instructions). In the length and breadth of the arguments E on behalf of the respondents, it has nowhere been pointed out if such “further instructions” were ever issued to the appellant before issuance of the cancellation s dated 19.11.2019 and 21.11.2019 as also before issuance of show-cause notice dated 26.11.2019. That being the position, the debarment had been issued against the appellant without due regard to the F undeniable factual situation where the entire blame could not have been foisted upon or shifted towards the appellant. The impugned s dated 23.04.2021 in W.P. No. 12075 of 2020 and dated 13.12.2021 in Review Petition are set aside; and the writ petition filed by the appellant is allowed.
