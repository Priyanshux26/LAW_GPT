However, no time period was specifi ed therein for delegation of powers by the Central Government. It is therefore absurd that such a condition should be imposed on the State Government. Accordingly, the proviso to S. 3(2) can be given a meaningful object and purpose only if the limitation of 3 months at a time is applied to the period of detention, and not to the period of delegation. 1.8 Thirdly, Art. 22 of the Constitution places some importance on curtailing the period of preventive detention to 3 months unless certain stringent conditions are satisfi ed. Art. 22(4) stipulates that no law can provide for preventive detention for a period longer than 3 months unless the opinion of an Advisory Board is obtained. Further, Art. 22(7)(a) requires the Parliament to pass a law prescribing the circumstances under which persons can be detained for longer than 3 months without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board. The proviso to S. 3(2) and its interpretation in Cherukuri Mani are therefore expressions of the notion that a preventive detention ought to be reviewed after 3 months, a limitation inherent in Art. 22 itself. 1.9 Lastly, if there is any ambiguity in a provision in a preventive detention statute or the same is capable of two possible interpretations, PESALA NOOKARAJU v. THE GOVERNMENT OF 535 ANDHRA PRADESH & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] then the construction which enures to the benefi t of the detenue and furthers the protection to life and liberty guaranteed under Art. 21 must be favoured. Preventive detention law/Art. 22 is merely an exception to the rule under Art. 21, and must therefore be confi ned within narrow limits. Consequently, the interpretation of S. 3(2) proviso in Cherukuri Mani ought to be preferred over the s relied upon by the Respondents. Reference may be had to the following case law: (a) M. Ravindran v. Intelligence Officer, Directorate of Intelligence, (2021) 2 SCC 485. (b) Rekha v. State of Tamil Nadu, (2011) 5 SCC 244 [paras 13-17 & 21]. II. The Detention is Based on Stale Material 2.1 It is a settled position of law that an of preventive detention can only be based on criminal antecedents which have a proximate nexus with the immediate need to detain an individual. An based on stale incidents is therefore not sustainable. Reliance is placed on the following s: (a) Khaja Bilal Ahmed v. State of Telangana & Ors., (2020) 13 SCC 632 [paras 21-23 & 28] (b) Mallada K. Sri Ram v. State of Telangana & Ors., 2022 SCC OnLine SC 424 [paras 11-15]. 2.2 In Mallada K. Sri Ram, the detention dated 19.05.2021 was based on 2 FIRs dated 15.10.2020 and 17.12.2020. The detenue was released on bail in the 1st FIR on 08.01.2021 and in the 2nd FIR on 11.01.2021 [paras 4 & 5]. This Hon’ble Court was pleased to quash the said detention on the ground that it was passed nearly 7 months after the 1st FIR and 5 months after the 2nd FIR, and was therefore based on stale material and demonstrated non-application of mind [para 11].
