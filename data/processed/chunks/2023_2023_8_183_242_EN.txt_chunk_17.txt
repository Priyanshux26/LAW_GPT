Mr. Vishrov Mukerjee submits that the learned APTEL as well as the CERC have grossly erred in rejecting the claim for compensation on the ground of: C (i) change in source of coal from Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (“MCL” for short) to Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (“ECL” for short) vide Notification dated 26th February 2014 issued by the CIL; (ii) change in mode of transportation from rail to road vide D Notification dated 29th September 2014 issued by MCL; (iii) increase in levy of Minimum Alternate Tax (“MAT” for short); and (iv) interest on working capital. E 56. Learned counsel submitted that change in source of coal from MCL to ECL was on account of the notification issued by the CIL, which is an instrumentality of the State. Similarly, he submitted that the change in mode of transportation from rail to road was on account of the notification issued by the MCL. Learned counsel submits that, since, on account of these notifications, the cost of transportation of coal increased, F applying the restitutionary principle, the CERC as well as the learned APTEL ought to have granted claims on the basis of ‘Change in Law’. He further submits that increase in levy of MAT has also been increased by the Union of India and, as such, the same would also amount to ‘Change in Law’. It is further submitted that interest on working capital G was also increased on account of the s of the instrumentalities of the State and, as such, compensation also ought to have been granted for the same. 57. Learned counsel for the Bihar Discoms submits that the CERC as well as the learned APTEL have grossly erred in allowing claims on certain components on the ground of ‘Change in Law’.
