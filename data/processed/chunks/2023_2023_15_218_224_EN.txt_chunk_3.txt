12.2 The learned Standing counsel however agrees that determination of the status of the appellant as a migrant family from Rajasthan is to be done as per the provisions of the 2012 Rules. 13. The family tree produced by the appellant clearly indicates that Mulchand Hemraj is the paternal grandfather of the appellant. Therefore, the Division Bench obviously misread the family tree in making the incorrect observation that name of the person Mulchand Hemraj, the appellant’s paternal grand-father, does not fi gure in the family tree. 14. The School Leaving Certifi cate of Ramavatar (son of Mulchand Hemraj), the appellant’s paternal uncle was made available before the Scrutiny Committee. The certifi cate indicated that Ramavatar took admission ASTHA GOPAL KHAKRA v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA & 223 ORS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] in the Municipal School, Akola on 12.08.1960. Similarly, the other paternal uncle of the appellant Radheshyam, as is discernible from the School Leaving Certifi cate of the same school, took admission on 18.07.1961. Obviously, at the time when admission was taken in 1960 and 1961, it must be the grand-father Mulchand Hemraj who secured admission for his two young sons in the said Municipal School at Akola. 15. The “relative” as defi ned in Rule 2(h) of the 2012 Rules reads as under: “(h) “relative” means a blood relative from paternal side of the applicant as per the geneology, except any particular tribe which has been notifi ed by the Government from Nomadic Tribes and any particular caste or tribes as notifi ed by the Government, from time to time;”… 16. The primary School Leaving Certifi cate of a relative from the parental side is one of the preferred documents for establishing a claim before the Scrutiny Committee. Appropriate certifi cates of the appellant’s two paternal uncles were produced indicating that the appellant’s grand- father had migrated and set up permanent residence at Akola on or before the deemed date i.e., 21.11.1961. 17. Notwithstanding the above, the appellant’s claim was rejected on the erroneous basis that she has not been able to produce any documents to the eff ect that her fore-fathers started residing in Maharashtra, prior to 1961. The two school leaving certifi cates of the two paternal uncles clearly demonstrate that the appellant’s grand-father had got his two sons (uncles of the appellant) admitted into the Municipal School at Akola on 12.08.1960 and 18.07.1961 respectively. This itself would clearly establish that the fore-fathers of the appellant had migrated and set up residence in Akola in Maharashtra, prior to the deemed date of 21.11.1961. The school leaving certifi cates would also satisfy the condition for residence mentioned in Rule 3 of the 2012 Rules. Yet a negative fi nding was given by the Scrutiny Committee which not only ignored the Enquiry Report of the Vigilance Squad made available on 27.12.2014 but also ignored the two school leaving certifi cates of the paternal uncles of the appellant. 224 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. 18. The materials on record suggest that the appellant’s grand father- Mulchand shifted to Akola sometime in the year 1960 and the two paternal uncles of the appellants were admitted to schools in Akola on 12.08.1960 and on 18.07.1961 well before the deemed date of 21.11.1961.
