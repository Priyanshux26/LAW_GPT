Digital Supreme Court Reports / of the Supreme Court Vikram Nath, J. 1. The premises in question were in the possession of three tenants. However, for the present, we are concerned with only two tenants, namely Vijaykumar Vishwanath Dhawale and Vinod Dodhu Chaudhary. As the third tenant had not filed any complaint and only the above two named complainants have filed the complaint, that is why the third tenant is not a party to the proceedings. 2. The premises in dispute were owned by one Rajeev Ramrao Chavan. He sold the property to five persons, namely Sanjay Nathmal Jain, Sunil Mishrilal Jain, Manoj Mishrilal Jain, Ghanshyam Bansilal Agrawal and Prasannachand Sobhagmal Parakh, vide registered sale deed dated 27.10.2021. Unfortunately, Rajeev Ramrao Chavan, the vendor of the sale deed dated 27.10.2021, died allegedly having committed suicide on 08.03.2022 and having left behind a suicide note, naming the tenants as abettors. On the strength of the same, a complaint was made to the local police. However, an accidental death was registered, but no FIR1 was registered under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code, 18602. 3. Soon thereafter, i.e., on 09.03.2022, the tenants were called to the concerned Police Station. They were held for about 24 hours, and in the meantime, the premises in question were demolished by the brother of the deceased-vendor, his widow, and with the support of the local police. At the Police Station, the tenants were also forced to sign some documents, apparently giving their consent of vacating the premises voluntarily. 4. The two tenants, Vijaykumar Vishwanath Dhawale and Vinod Dodhu Chaudhary lodged complaint initially with the Police Station, but as the same was not acknowledged, they moved an application before the concerned Magistrate under Section 156(3) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 19733. In the complaint made by the two tenants, 13 1 First Information Report 2 ‘IPC’ 3 In short, “Cr.P.C.” [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1131 Shatrughna Atmaram Patil & Ors. v. Vinod Dodhu Chaudhary & Anr. accused were named, namely Dr. Sanjeev Ramrao Chavan i.e. brother of the deceased, Smita Rajeev Chavan i.e. widow of the deceased, the five purchasers mentioned above under the sale deed dated 27.10.2021, and six police personnel namely, Shatrughna Atmaram Patil, Jaipal Manikrao Hire, Milind Ashok Bhamare, Suryakant Raghunath Salunkhe, Nilesh Subhash More and Sunil Kautik Hatkar. 5. The learned Magistrate, dealing with the Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. application, instead of directing the police to register the FIR and investigate, passed an on 20.12.2022 for an inquiry under Section 202 Cr.P.C., confining it to the involvement of the brother of the deceased, widow of the deceased, and the five purchasers.
