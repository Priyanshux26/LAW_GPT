Digital Supreme Court Reports migrants would be accepted as Indian citizens by the leaders of the movement. The Central Government, in their early negotiations with the Assamese leaders, suggested 1971 as this date, which was generally agreed upon by the opposition political parties. Given the humanitarian crisis, this consensus was crucial. However, the Assamese leaders insisted on 1951 as the cut-off date. 67. However, after February 1983, the mass support for the agitational programs reportedly began to wither. The intensity of popular mobilization had fizzled out by the second half of 1983. The events of early 1983 had created a sense of cluelessness; many were tormented by the violent turn the movement had taken, and the movement began to lose its unifying appeal. 68. In 1983, the Government of India enacted the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, 1983 (“IMDT Act”) by which tribunals were established for determining whether a person is an illegal migrant and to enable the Central Government to expel or deport those determined as such. The IMDT Act was made applicable to anyone who came into India after 25.03.1971 and was made applicable only to the State of Assam. However, in 2005, a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Sarbananda Sonowal (supra) struck down the IMDT Act and the rules made thereunder. 69.

Once again, students took to the streets and called for bandhs and picketing.53 70. However, as the movement became long drawn, the leaders too recognized the ground reality – that it was time for a settlement with the Central Government. After years of popular protest, the number of street agitators had declined and the outlook of the leaders of the movement also changed accordingly.54 53 Assam Tribune, Jun. 15 and 16, 1984. 54 Lok Sabha Debates, Statement of A.K.
