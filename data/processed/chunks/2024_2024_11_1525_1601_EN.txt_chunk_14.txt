1547 M/s Bharti Airtel Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Central Excise, Pune Act. However, Chapter Heading 7308 is not specified either in Clause (i) or Clause (ii) of Rule 2(a)(A) of the CENVAT Rules. Consequently, since tower is not one of the items specified in the Rules as “capital goods”, duties paid for parts of the tower cannot be claimed as CENVAT Credit. iii) Even if it is assumed that CENVAT credit on the parts of the towers would be admissible under Clause (iii) of Rule 2(a)(A), there is an explicit condition that the said goods should be components, spares and accessories of the goods specified in Clauses (i) and (ii) of Rule 2(a) (A). As tower is not a “capital good” under the aforesaid clauses, duty paid on its parts, therefore, is not admissible for availing CENVAT credit. iv) Only those articles which go into composition of another article can be considered as components or parts of the latter. Though GSM and the network antenna are specified under Tariff Chapter Heading 8517, tower on which the antenna is placed is not classified as such under the said Tariff chapter Heading 8517. Thus, tower cannot be considered to be a component to the antenna within the meaning of Rule 2(a)(A)(iii) as it does not enter into the composition of the antenna. (v) As regards, availing the CENVAT credit in respect of “input”, it was submitted by the Revenue that only a manufacturer can avail such credit and not a service provider. 9.17.1 In support of the contentions, the Revenue cited a number of s before the Bombay High Court, some of which are referred as below: (i) Vandana Global Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise, Raipur, 2010 (253) E.L.T. 440 (Tri.-LB). (ii) Quality Steel Tubes (P) Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise (1995) 2 SCC 372.

Collector of Central Excise, Meerut (1997) 1 SCC 203. (v) Commissioner of Central Excise, Indore v. Cethar Vessels Ltd. & Ors. (2009) 17 SCC 551. (vi) Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay v. Indian Oil Corporation, 1991 Supp (2) SCC 18. (vii) Cellular Operators Association of India & Ors. V. Municipal Corporation of Delhi etc., 2011 SCC OnLine Del 2003.

The Bombay High Court after analysing the facts of the present case, in the light of the case laws cited by the contesting parties and relevant provisions of the CENVAT Rules, rejected the contention of the Assessees that they were entitled to credit of the duties paid on these items since BTS is a single integrated system consisting of tower, GSM or Microwave Antennas, PFB, isolation transformers, electrical equipments, generator sets, feeder cables etc., and these are to be treated as “composite system” classified under Chapter Heading 85.25 of the Tariff Act and hence be treated as “capital goods” and credit be allowed.
