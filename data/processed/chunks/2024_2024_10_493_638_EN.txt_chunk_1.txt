495 Sukanya Shantha v. Union of India & Ors. remissions has to be maximisation of the reformatory potential of prisons – Such classification should be based solely on the correctional needs of the individual prisoner – Thus, Rules that discriminate among individual prisoners on the basis of their caste specifically or indirectly by referring to proxies of caste identity are violative of Art. 14 on account of invalid classification and subversion of substantive equality – Constitution of India – Arts.14, 15(1). [Paras 164-170, 196] Prisons – Prison Manuals – Plea that provisions thereunder, discriminate against marginalized castes and act to the advantage of certain castes, by assigning cleaning and sweeping work to marginalized castes, while allowing the high castes to do cooking, which is direct discrimination u/Art.15(1): Held: Manuals/rules suffer from indirect discrimination by using broad terms which act to the disadvantage of the marginalized castes – Phrases such as “menial” jobs to be performed by castes “accustomed to perform such duties” may appear to be facially neutral, but refer to marginalized communities, given the history of systemic discrimination against them – Such indirect usages of phrases, which target the so-called ‘lower castes’, cannot be permitted in the constitutional framework – Phrases, carry an embedded bias that disadvantages marginalized communities by reinforcing historical patterns of labour based on caste – These provisions disproportionately harm marginalized castes, perpetuate caste-based labour divisions and reinforce social hierarchies – Manuals/rules are also based on and reinforce stereotypes against the marginalized castes as also denotified tribes – These stereotypes not only demean and stigmatize marginalized communities and denotified tribes but also serve to maintain and legitimize a social hierarchy that goes against the constitutional values of equality – Tendency to treat members of denotified tribes as habitual to crime or having bad character reinforces a stereotype, which excludes them from meaningful participation in social life – Discrimination against denotified tribes is prohibited under the ground of “caste” in Art. 15(1), as the colonial regime considered them as belonging to separate hereditary castes – Thus, the impugned provisions violative of Art. 15 – Constitution of India – Art.15. [Paras 171-175, 196] 496 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Prisons – Prison Manuals – Plea that provisions thereunder, “practice” of untouchability, division of work on the basis of caste, is a practice of untouchability prohibited under the Constitution: Held: Prison manuals allot tasks of a barber to individuals from a certain caste, while sweeping work is allowed to Mehtar/Hari/ Chandal or similar castes – This is a caste-based delegation of work based on the perceptions of the caste system that certain castes are meant to do jobs of sweeping – Rule that a prisoner of a high caste be allowed to refuse the food cooked by other castes is a legal sanction by the State authorities to untouchability and the caste system – Provisions that “men of wandering tribes” or “criminal tribes” have a “strong natural tendency to escape” or are by “habit” accustomed to theft reflects a stereotype that has its basis in the colonial understanding of India’s caste system – These stereotypes not only criminalize entire communities but also reinforce caste- based prejudices – They resemble a form of untouchability, as they assign certain negative traits to specific groups based on identity, perpetuating their marginalization and exclusion – Once labelled a criminal tribe, individuals from these communities faced systematic discrimination in employment, education, and social services – Provision that “non-habitual” prisoner is “by social status” and “habit of life accustomed to superior mode of living” is another caste-based construct – It is only an injustice but also reinforced existing power structures, ensuring that marginalized groups were trapped in cycles of poverty and discrimination, unable to transcend the stigmatization they faced – Thus, impugned provisions violative of Art.17 – Constitution of India – Art.17.
