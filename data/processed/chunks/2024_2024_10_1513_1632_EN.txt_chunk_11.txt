v. Union of India & Ors. I am doomed to seclusion; every aspiration of mine to rise above my ignorant sisters is looked upon with suspicion, and is interpreted in the most uncharitable manner.” 1 ~ Rukhmabai I. Background 1. The Petitioner has approached this court under Article 32 of the Constitution to raise an issue which has been debated in our nation for over one and a half centuries. The Petitioner is an NGO that has worked extensively against child marriage. The Petitioner’s primary grievance is that despite the enactment of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 20062, the rate of child marriages in India is alarming. The Petitioner seeks to address the failure of authorities to prevent child marriages. The Petitioner has sought stronger enforcement mechanisms, awareness programs, the appointment of Child Marriage Prohibition Officers, and comprehensive support systems for child brides – including education, healthcare, and compensation, to ensure the protection and welfare of vulnerable minors. Accordingly, the Petitioner prays for the issuance of effective guidelines. 2. Child marriage is a social evil, and its commission is a criminal offence. Despite the near-universal agreement on the ills of child marriage, its commission and prevalence have been sobering. Child marriage is the phenomenon of children being married before they attain the minimum legal age under the law. Globally, children continue – despite legal norms to the contrary – to be married before they reach the age of eighteen years. Patriarchy, gender inequality, poverty and lack of education and employment lead to child marriage.3 The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child regards child marriage as a violation of human rights4. While both sexes are inflicted with the violence of child marriages, the prevalence of child marriage globally among boys is one-sixth that of girls.5 1 Extracted from a letter written by Rukhmabai to the Times of India on 26 June 1885. 2 ‘PCMA’ 3 UNICEF (2023).

Digital Supreme Court Reports 3. Elimination of child, early and forced marriages has been committed to by one hundred and ninety-three nations, including India under target 5.36 of the Sustainable Development Goals7. Section 28 of PCMA defines child marriage as a marriage to which either of the contracting parties is a child. Girls below the age of eighteen and boys below the age of twenty-one are deemed to be children under the PCMA.9 4. The 2019-2021 National Family Health Survey-510 pits child marriage at 23.3% of girls11 under the age of eighteen and 17.7% of boys12 under the age of twenty-one. The data is based on a survey of women aged 20-24 and men aged 25-29.This is a reduction from the 2015-2016 NFHS-4 which showed that 26.8% of girls and 20.3% of boys marry under the legal age of marriage.
