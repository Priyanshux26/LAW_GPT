In view of the above facts and circumstances of the case the High Court has seriously erred in observing that no case is made out to invoke Section 149 IPC. [Paras 10, 10.1][361-A-C, F-H; 362-A] Bharwad Mepa Dana & Anr. Vs. State of Bombay 1960 E (2) SCR 172 – relied on. 1.2 Once the respondent – accused was found to be member of the unlawful assembly of more than five persons and he actually participated in commission of the offence may be the fatal blow might have been given by the another accused, in the present F case ‘BS’, still with the aid of Section 149 IPC, Respondent Accused can be convicted for the offence under Section 302 IPC with the aid of Section 149 IPC. The case would certainly fall within first part of Section 149 IPC. As per first part of Section 149 IPC if an offence is committed by any member of unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, G every person who, at the time of that offence, is a member of the same assembly, is guilty of that offence. [Para 10.2][362-B-C] Mizaji and Anr. Vs. The State of U.P. [1959] Supp. 1 SCR 940 – relied on. H 356 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A 1.3 The submission on behalf of the accused that there was a delay of 3 ½ days has been elaborately dealt with and considered by the learned trial Court in detail. A proper explanation has been given by the complainant. Immediately after the occurrence the injured were taken to the hospital for treatment. The condition of ‘BS’ was serious. Complainant concentrated on his treatment. B Another injured ‘NS’ also remained busy for the treatment. Thus, when the delay has been sufficiently and properly explained, there is no reason to give benefit of doubt to the accused on the aforesaid ground that there was a delay of 3 ½ days in lodging the FIR. [Para 11.1][363-G-H; 364-A-B] C 1.4 As per the medical opinion and the deposition of doctor the death occurred due to injury no.9 from the shock of wound at spinal bone of neck. Though the injury no.9 was caused by the accused ‘BS’, the respondent accused being a part of the unlawful assembly and who also participated in commission of the offence, D he shall also be liable to be convicted for the offence under Section 302 IPC with the aid of Section 149 IPC, even for the act of the accused ‘BS’ who gave the fatal blow. The impugned and passed by the High Court acquitting the respondent – accused for the offence under Section 302 under Section 149 IPC is hereby quashed and set aside. The and passed E by the learned Trial Court convicting the respondent – accused for the offence under Sections 147, 323 and 302/149 IPC is restored.
