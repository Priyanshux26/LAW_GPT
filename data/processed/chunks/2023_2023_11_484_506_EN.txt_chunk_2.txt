would also serve the ends of justice if the appropriate government had the benefi t of a report contemporaneously prepared by a qualifi ed psychologist after interacting/interviewing the convict that has applied for premature release. [Paras 20 and 21] Adminstration of Criminal Justice – Sentencing – Balancing societal interests with the rights of the convict: Held: The majority view and the minority view in Sriharan underlined the need to balance societal interests with the rights of the convict (that in a given case, the sentence should not be unduly harsh, or excessive) – The court acknowledged that it lies within the executive’s domain to grant, or refuse premature release; however, such power would be guided, and the discretion informed by reason, stemming from appropriate rules. [Para 22] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Remission – Diff erent policies on the date of conviction and on the date of consideration for premature release: Held: This court had grappled with the situation of diff erent remission policies/rules prevailing at diff erent points of the convict’s sentence- i.e., when the policy on the date of conviction, and on the date of consideration for premature release, are diff erent – It has been held that the policy prevailing on the date of the conviction20 , would be applicable – However, in Jagdish it was also recognised that if a more liberal policy exists on the date of consideration, the benefi t should be provided – In the present case, on the date of conviction (24.05.2001), it is the pre-2002 policy that was applicable – In the old pre-2002 policy, there is no mention of any ineligibility criteria, much less one that is analogous to Rule 529(iv)(b) of the 2002 policy, which was cited by the Remission Board in its rejection of the petitioner’s application on 20.04.2023.
