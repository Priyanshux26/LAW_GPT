iv. Subsequently, Madrasatul Uloom was established as the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College (MAO College) on January 8, 1877, as a registered society. During the laying of the foundation stone, the College Fund Committee addressed the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, expressing the hope that the college would eventually evolve into a university spreading the values of free inquiry, tolerance, and morality. v. The Rules and Regulations of MAO College emphasized its primary objective as the education of Muslims, while also accommodating Hindus and other communities. vi. Administration of MAO College was exclusively entrusted to the Muslim community, as evidenced by various resolutions and rules. The Select Committee for the Advancement of Muslim Education, the Fund Committee, and the Trusteeship regulations all mandated Muslim involvement in the institution’s governance. 196. The Appellants sought to highlight that in the second phase, the MAO College expanded, and Sir Syed and the Muslim community continued to seek government support for its “conversion” into a university by placing reliance on the following : i. Sir Syed pursued government support primarily because the Muslim community viewed a degree as essential for success and government employment. This viewpoint was documented in Mr. Altaf Husain Hali’s biography of Sir Syed, “Hayat-i-Javed.” Justice S Amir Ali also stressed the necessity for the proposed university to be empowered to grant government-recognized degrees. ii. To further this goal, the College Fund Committee presented a written address to the Viceroy on 18.11.1884, expressing the hope that, with increased funds and completed schemes, they would seek recognition as an independent university. iii. After Sir Syed’s demise on 27.03.1898, a memorial fund was established on 08.04.1901 to gather funds for elevating MAO College to university status. This endeavor met with success, with Rs. 1,27,000/- collected by 11.11.1901. Additionally, Mr. Syed Jafar Husain initiated the ‘one rupee fund’ scheme, [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2005 Aligarh Muslim University v. Naresh Agarwal & Ors. urging each Muslim to contribute at least one rupee towards the proposed university, resulting in substantial funds being raised. iv. Various representations were made to the government by the MAO College management and members of the Muslim community, including addresses to the Viceroy on 01.10.1906 and 22.04.1908, seeking assistance in establishing a Muslim university. The 22.04.1908 address emphasized the alignment of their goals with Sir Syed’s vision, with significant support from figures like Mr. Justice Mahmood and Mr. Theodore Morison. v. In 1910, the efforts of the Muslim community garnered in- principle acceptance from the Government of India for the conversion of MAO College into a Muslim University. 197. The Appellants pointed out that in the final phase, the Muslim community continued to collect funds and negotiate with the government to establish the university, highlighting the following : i. In 1911, the internal Foundation Committee was formed to establish a University, with the Raja Saheb of Mahmoodabad as its President. ii. On 18.07.1911, the Secretary of State approved in principle the establishment of a university at Aligarh, subject to the provision of adequate funds and control, based on the recommendation of the Government of India dated 10.06.1911. iii.
