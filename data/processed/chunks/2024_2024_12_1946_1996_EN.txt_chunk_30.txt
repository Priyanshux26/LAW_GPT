The relevant observations made by the Court are reproduced hereinbelow: [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1989 Bijoy Kumar Moni v. Paresh Manna & Anr. “10. In the present case, it is an admitted fact that the drawer of the cheque was the respondent, who had drawn the cheque, bearing No. 075073 for Rs 74,200 on a bank account maintained by him towards the refund of the booking amount. Therefore, he was the drawer of the cheque. The case of the appellant, apart from being supported by the provision of Section 138 of the NI Act, also gets buttressed by the in P.J. Agro Tech Ltd. v. Water Base Ltd. [(2010) 12 SCC 146 : (2010) 4 SCC (Civ) 588 : (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 164] , where this Court has dealt with the scope of Section 138 and held that : (SCC p. 150, para 13) “13. … it is very clear that in to attract the provisions thereof a cheque which is dishonoured will have to be drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with the banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part of any debt or other liability. It is only such a cheque which is dishonoured which would attract the provisions of Section 138 of the above Act against the drawer of the cheque.” 11. About the liability under Section 138 of the NI Act, where the cheque drawn by the employee of the appellant Company on his personal account, even if it be for discharging dues of the appellant Company and its Directors, the appellant Company and its Directors cannot be made liable under Section 138. Thus, we observe that in the abovementioned case, the personal liability was upheld and the Company and its Directors were absolved of the liability. The logic applied was that the section itself makes the drawer liable and no other person. […]” (Emphasis supplied) v. Section 141 of the NI Act 59. In Aneeta Hada (supra), this Court fortified the view that criminal liability on account of dishonor of cheque primarily falls on the 1990 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports drawer company and then extends to its officers only when the conditions incorporated in Section 141 of the NI Act are satisfied. While explaining the import of the words “as well as the company” occurring in the provision, the Court observed that the commission of an offence by the company is an express condition precedent and only when the prosecution is maintainable against the Company that the persons mentioned in the other categories under Section 141 can be vicariously made liable for the offence committed under Section 138 of the NI Act. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow: “53. It is to be borne in mind that Section 141 of the Act is concerned with the offences by the company. It makes the other persons vicariously liable for commission of an offence on the part of the company.
