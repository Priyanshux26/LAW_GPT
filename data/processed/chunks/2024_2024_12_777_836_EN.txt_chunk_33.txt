Supreme Court Reports on the basis of an FIR registered at the instance of the mother of the accused in relation to the alleged illegal detention of the accused for the period from 24.06.1999 to 28.06.1999. While holding that no sanction to prosecute was required in the circumstances of an illegal detention, this Court observed as thus: “23. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents, we are of the view that the decision rendered by this Court in P.P. Unnikrishnan case [P.P. Unnikrishnan v. Puttiyottil Alikutty (2000) 8 SCC 131 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 1460] is clear and emphatic. The same does not leave any room for making any choice. It is apparent that the official arrest of Neeraj Kumar in terms of the provisions of the Code, referred to hereinabove, would extend during the period from 28-6-1999 to 30-6-1999. The above period of apprehension can legitimately be considered as having been made “while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of their official duties”. The factual position expressed by the appellants is that Neeraj Kumar was not detained for the period from 24-6-1999 to 28-6- 1999. His detention during the above period, if true, in our considered view, would certainly not emerge from the action of the accused while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of their official duties. If it emerges from the evidence adduced before the trial court that Neeraj Kumar was actually detained during the period from 24-6-1999 to 28-6-1999, the said detention cannot be taken to have been made by the accused while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of their official duties. More so, because it is not the case of the appellants that they had kept Neeraj Kumar in jail during the period from 24-6- 1999 to 28-6-1999. If they had not detained him during the above period, it is not open to anyone to assume the position that the detention of Neeraj Kumar, during the above period, was while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of their official duties. Therefore, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, based on the legal position declared by this Court in P.P. Unnikrishnan case [P.P. Unnikrishnan v. Puttiyottil Alikutty (2000) 8 SCC 131 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 1460] , we are of the considered view that [2024] 12 S.C.R. 821 Om Prakash Yadav v. Niranjan Kumar Upadhyay & Ors. sanction for prosecution of the accused in relation to the detention of Neeraj Kumar for the period from 24-6-1999 to 28-6-1999 would not be required before a court of competent jurisdiction takes cognizance with reference to the alleged arrest of Neeraj Kumar. We therefore hereby, endorse the conclusions drawn by the High Court to the above effect.” (emphasis supplied) 65. Thus, the legal position that emerges from a conspectus of all the decisions referred to above is that it is not possible to carve out one universal rule that can be uniformly applied to the multivarious facts and circumstances in the context of which the protection under Section 197 CrPC is sought for.
