Shroff, learned counsel for the State, contended that the conviction based on concurrent findings, and sentence imposed was commensurate in the present case, which was a cold-blooded murder. C It was submitted that the act of abduction committed in a clandestine manner and the thought process that guided the series of events, was executed with preplanning and premeditation. This was evidenced by the fact that the deceased was murdered on 19.01.2003, and the family was made to believe that their son was alive, and in view of which they D regularly demanded ransom from the family. Reliance was placed on Arvind Singh v.

THE STATE OF DELHI 759 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] pond. These circumstances, it was argued, justified that this was a cold- A blooded murder, which fell within the gravest of grave category of cases. 11.
