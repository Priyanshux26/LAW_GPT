Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another relationship with a third party and the principal’s co-relative liability to have his relations altered – (b) As the agent acts on behalf of the principal, one of the prime elements of the relationship is the exercise of a degree of control by the principal over the conduct of the activities of the agent – This degree of control is less than the control exercised by the master on the servant, and is different from the rights and obligations in case of principal to principal and independent contractor relationship – (c) The task entrusted by the principal to the agent should result in a fiduciary relationship – The fiduciary relationship is the manifestation of consent by one person to another to act on his or her behalf and subject to his or her control, and the reciprocal consent by the other to do so – (d) As the business done by the agent is on the principal’s account, the agent is liable to render accounts thereof to the principal – An agent is entitled to remuneration from the principal for the work he performs for the principal – Other relevant aspects/considerations, discussed. [Paras 8, 9] Income Tax Act, 1961 – Explanation (i) to s.194-H: Held: The words “direct” or “indirect” in Explanation (i) to s.194-H are with reference to the act of payment – The legislative intent to include “indirect” payment ensures that the net cast by the section is plugged and not avoided or escaped, albeit it does not dilute the requirement that the payment must be on behalf “the person responsible for paying”– This means that the payment/ credit in the account should arise from the obligation of “the person responsible for paying” – The payee should be the person who has the right to receive the payment from “the person responsible for paying” – Further, explanation (i) to s.194-H, by using the word “indirectly”, does not regulate or curtail the manner in which the assessee can conduct business and enter into commercial relationships – Neither does the word “indirectly” create an obligation where the main provision does not apply – The tax legislation recognises diverse relationships and modes in which commerce and trade are conducted, albeit obligation to tax at source arises only if the conditions as mentioned in s.194-H are met and not otherwise – This principle does not negate the compliance required by law – Latter portion of the Explanation (i) to s.194-H is a requirement and a pre-condition – It should not be read as diminishing or derogating the requirement of 1004 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
