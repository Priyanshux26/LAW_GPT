We have had plethora of cases in the post-PIL period wherein prolonged litigation against infrastructural projects resulted in inordinate delays to the extent that the projects got buried forever or became unviable owing to excessive burden on the public exchequer (honest taxpayers’ money). That is where this Court’s power to do not only complete but substantial justice gets triggered. x x x 576. There is ample support to the proposition that when larger national interest is involved and concerns of public [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1955 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. exchequer are directly involved in the lis, the Court must act at the earliest opportunity. For, each day’s delay has a direct impact on the exchequer. In Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India [Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India, (2000) 10 SCC 664] , the Court resonated this position and observed thus : (SCC pp. 761-62, para 227) “227. There are three stages with regard to the undertaking of an infrastructural project. One is conception or planning, second is decision to undertake the project and the third is the execution of the project. The conception and the decision to undertake a project is to be regarded as a policy decision. While there is always a need for such projects not being unduly delayed, it is at the same time expected that a thorough possible study will be undertaken before a decision is taken to start a project. Once such a considered decision is taken, the proper execution of the same should be undertaken expeditiously. It is for the Government to decide how to do its job. When it has put a system in place for the execution of a project and such a system cannot be said to be arbitrary, then the only role which a court may have to play is to see that the system works in the manner it was envisaged.” (Emphasis supplied) 52. The above proposition resonates with the present case. Unfortunately, despite the national and public interest involved, this case remained pending for two decades, which must lead to introspection on both sides of the bench. 53. I would like to place on record appreciation for all the counsel for taking us through the voluminous record and providing us with detailed hand-outs on the case file, which are purely a substance of their hard work. 54. The writ petitions are dismissed and disposed of in terms of the above . The contempt petitions stand closed in the above terms. The Civil Appeal stands disposed of in light of the above. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. 1956 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Nagarathna, J.
