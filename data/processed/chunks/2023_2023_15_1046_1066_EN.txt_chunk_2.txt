The issue in both the Civil Appeals raised is identical, but for the sake of convenience, for facts we would be only referring to Civil Appeal No.1320 of 2010. 2. The High Court in the impugned dated 14.10.2008 has allowed the Writ Petition of the respondent by setting aside the (dated 18.03.2008), passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad (for short ‘CAT’) which upheld the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings by the Nuclear Fuel Complex-Hyderabad (hereinafter referred to as ‘NFC’ or ‘Department’), against the respondent under the Central Civil Services (Classifi cation, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965 (for short ‘CCA Rules 1965’). The short question which was there before the High Court and which is now before us, is whether the disciplinary proceedings against the respondent (who is admittedly a workman), could be initiated under the CCA Rules 1965 or it could be done only under the Standing s certifi ed for the NFC-Hyderabad on 27.08.1973 (hereinafter referred to as “Standing s”), under the Industrial Employment (Standing s) Act, 1946 (hereinafter referred to as ‘1946 Act’). 3. NFC was set up in the 1970s, as a constituent unit of the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India. The respondent was appointed as a ‘helper’ w.e.f. 05.05.2001 in NFC. Helper is the class IV post and it seems that the eligibility requirement for the post was a Class VI certifi cate which the respondent had submitted in to get the appointment. On 23.04.2003 he received a memorandum which said that he had given a false declaration that he had passed Class VI as the transfer certifi cate of 105 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Class VI submitted by him was found to be fake for which a disciplinary action was to be initiated against him under CCA Rules 1965. In response, the respondent denied the allegations and asserted that his certifi cate is genuine and further contended that the disciplinary proceedings, if any, would be governed by the Standing s and not under the CCA Rules 1965, and ultimately, he fi led an OA before the CAT, Hyderabad, with a prayer to set aside the proceedings against him, inter alia, on the grounds that the disciplinary proceedings against him can only be initiated under the “Standing s”, and not under the CCA Rules. The CAT, dismissed his O.A. vide its dated 18.03.2008. The CAT relied on his appointment , as well as the circular dated 12.05.2005 issued by the Department to clarify that their employees were governed by the CCA Rules and not Standing s. This of CAT, was challenged by the respondent in a writ petition before the High Court which was allowed and the of the CAT was set aside and the disciplinary proceedings against the respondent were quashed. 4. The case of the respondent is that he being a workman will be covered by the Standing s which contain provisions to deal with matters, inter alia, of disciplinary proceedings, and therefore the proceedings initiated against him under the CCA Rules, 1965 are without jurisdiction.
