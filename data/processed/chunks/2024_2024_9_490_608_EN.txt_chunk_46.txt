We, therefore, reject the argument on behalf of R-2 that it was not bound by the arbitration agreement and that it ought not to have been made jointly and severally liable along with OPG for the dues payable to Enexio. Sub-issue (a) is decided in the aforesaid terms. ENEXIO’S CLAIM NOT BARRED BY LIMITATION. 82. On the issue as to whether Enexio’s claim was barred by time, the submissions of the appellants, inter alia, are: (a) The date fixed by the contract for completion of the obligations of supply of goods and erection of ACC unit is 31 March 2014. Hence, the date of reckoning for the purposes of limitation ought to be 31 March 2014. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 555 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. (b) The contract was a mixture of supply of goods and services (i.e., works). Therefore, Article 14 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act applied for the price of goods supplied, and Article 18 applied for the price of works provided, for computing the limitation period of the claim. In either case, the limitation period of three years would commence to run, not later than, from 31 March 2014. (c) Even if it is assumed that the deemed date of completion was 21 September 2015 (as held by the arbitral tribunal), the claim being filed on 2 May 2019, was well beyond 3 years from that date. (d) Once the period of limitation started to run, in terms of Articles 14 and 18, mere negotiations could not have extended the period of limitation. Therefore, the award, which takes a contrary view, is patently illegal. 83. Before proceeding further, we must remind ourselves that sub-section (1) of Section 4364 of the 1996 Act makes the Limitation Act, 1963 (in short, 1963 Act) applicable to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in Court. Sub-section (2) of Section 43 provides that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an arbitral proceeding shall be deemed to have commenced on the date specified in Section 21.65 On a conjoint reading of sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 43 of the 1996 Act 64 Section 43. Limitations. – (1) The Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963) shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in Court. (2) For the purposes of this section and the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), an arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced on the date referred in section 21. (3) Where an arbitration agreement to submit future disputes to arbitration provides that any claim to which the agreement applies shall be barred unless some step to commence arbitral proceedings is taken within the time specified by the agreement, and a dispute arises to which the agreement applies, the court, if it is of opinion that in the circumstances of the case undue hardship would otherwise be caused, and notwithstanding that the time so fixed has expired, may on such terms, if any, as the justice of the case may require, extend the time for such period as it thinks proper.
