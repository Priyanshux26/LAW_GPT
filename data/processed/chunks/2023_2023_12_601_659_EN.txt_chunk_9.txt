The action initiated by the Collector and the ratifi cation·of his by the State Government are matters which should have been allowed to take fi nal shape instead of being challenged at the interlocutory stage by the respondents. That being so, there is no necessity of going into the merits of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties with regard to the provisions of Section 166-B and 166-C of the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Land Revenue Act, 1317 Fasli. We, therefore, dispose of this appeal fi nally with the direction to the Collector to complete the proceedings, initiated by him by his dated 3rd of January, 1995 as ratifi ed by the Government by its, dated 24th of January, 1996, at an early date in accordance with law.” (Emphasis Applied) 18. Consequently, proceedings pursuant to the First SCN were initiated afresh by the Collector by issuing notice dated 17.08.2001 to the Assignees, many among whom were now represented by the Appellants, informing that the proceedings would be taken up by the Joint Collector in exercise of powers delegated by the Collector. The Appellants furnished fresh explanation(s) on 27.08.2001 and consequently the office of the Joint Collector passed a resumption dated 22.12.2001 in favour of the State noticing that:– “In view of the circumstances explained above and since the assignment itself is irregular and the assignees sold the land in conttavention of the conditions of assignment and also the assigned land has become urbanized and no longer subserves the purpose of cultivation, I find no reason either to upheld the s of the District Revenue Officer, Ranga Reddy passed in Procds.No. D1/275/94 Dated:15.9.1994 or to revert back the land in Sy.No.393/ 1 to 393/20 totally measuring an extent of Ac.142·39 of Mancllerevula village of Rajendranagar Mandal to the assignees. The land should be remained as Government land. Acoordingly the case is disposed off duly setting aside the s of District Revenue 616 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. Oflicer, Ranga Reddy District passed in proceedings No. Dl/275/94 Dated:l5-9-1994.” (sic) (Emphasis Applied) 19. The Joint Collector’s dated 22.12.2001 came to be challenged before the High Court, which vide its dated 04.04.2002 opined that in view of this Court’s judgement in Gudepu Sailoo4, the Joint Collector had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the First SCN and directed the District Collector to conduct the proceedings and pass appropriate s after notice to all parties. Resultantly, proceedings were conducted before the District Collector wherein again resumption dated 15.03.2003 was passed in favour of the State. It must be noted that the reasoning provided in the resumption s dated 22.12.2001 and 15.03.2003 is more or less identical. 20. The Appellants laid a challenge to the resumption dated 15.03.2003 and vide its dated 21.04.2006, the High Court set aside the same as well the First SCN, primarily for the reasons as are summed up in the following paragraphs of its :– “14. The principal ground on which the assignments soμght to be cancelled by invoking the review powers under section 166-B of the Act is execution of GPA by the assignees in favour of the predecessor in interest.
