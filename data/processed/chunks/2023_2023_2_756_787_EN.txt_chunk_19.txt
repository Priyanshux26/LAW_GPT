Even, in the impugned and B , the High Court has, at paragraph 19.4 recorded that Section 153C of the Act is a machinery provision. As per the settled position of law, the Courts, while interpreting machinery provisions of a taxing statute, must give effect to its manifest purpose by construing it in such a manner so as to effectuate the object and purpose of the statute. In the case of C Calcutta Knitwears, Ludhiana (supra), while interpreting Section 158BD (which has been replaced by Section 153C), this Court has observed in paras 18, 32 and 34 as under:- “18. Sections 158-BC and 158-BD of the Act are machinery provisions. Section 158-BC of the Act provides the procedure for block assessment and Section 158-BD of the Act provides for D assessments in the case of an undisclosed income of any other person. The said sections are relevant for the purpose of this case and, therefore, they are extracted. They read as under: “158-BC.Procedure for block assessment.—Where any search has been conducted under Section 132 or books of E account, other documents or assets are requisitioned under Section 132-A, in the case of any person, then— (a) the assessing officer shall— (i) in respect of search initiated or books of accounts or F other documents or any assets requisitioned after the 30th day of June, 1995 but before the 1st day of January, 1997 serve a notice to such person requiring him to furnish within such time not being less than fifteen days; (ii) in respect of search initiated or books of account or G other documents or any assets requisitioned on or after the 1st day of January, 1997 serve a notice to such person requiring him to furnish within such time not being less than fifteen days but not more than forty-five days, as may be specified in the notice a return in the prescribed form and verified in the same manner as a return under clause H 782 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R.
