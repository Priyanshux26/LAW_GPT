The crux of the matter as submitted by Mr Ranjit Kumar, learned Solicitor General for the Union of India, is that when any provision in Parliamentary legislation is read down, in the absence of the Union of India it is likely to cause enormous harm to the interest of the State as in many cases certain provisions have been engrafted to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India. D 11. The learned Solicitor General would contend that the authorities which have been placed reliance upon in both the s [Arup Bhuyan v. State of Assam, (2011) 3 SCC 377 : (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 855], [Indra Das v. State of Assam, (2011) 3 SCC 380 : (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 1150] by the two- E Judge Bench are founded on Bill of Rights which is different from Article 19 of the Constitution of India. He has referred to Articles 19(1)(c) and 19(4) of the Constitution. Article 19(1)(c) reads as follows : “19. (1)(c) to form associations or unions;” F The said article is further restricted by Article 19(4) which is as follows: “19. (4) Nothing in sub-clause (c) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of the G sovereignty and integrity of India or public or morality, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause.” 1 (2015) 12 SCC 702 H 560 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A Relying upon the same it is highlighted by the learned Solicitor General that the Court has not kept this aspect in view while placing heavy reliance on the foreign authorities which are fundamentally not applicable to the interpretative process of the provisions which have been enacted in consonance with the provisions of the Constitution of India. B 12. Regard being had to the important issue raised by the learned Solicitor General and Mr. Jaideep Gupta, learned Senior Counsel, for the State of Assam, we think it appropriate that the matter should be considered by a larger bench. Let the registry place the papers before the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India for appropriate C s.” 2. Therefore, the issue which arises for consideration is, whether the Hon’ble Division Bench in Arup Bhuyan v. State of Assam2 an similarly in Sri Indra Das v. State of Assam3 (two-Judge Bench) (h reafter referred to as ‘Arup Bhuyan’ and ‘Indra Das’, respectivel D )was correct in placing reliance on American decisions stating th t the decisions apply to India too, “as our fundamental rights are s milar to the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution” to read down S. (5) of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act, 1987/S.10 f Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (hereafter referred to as E UAPA)?4 General Development of Article 19 of the Indian Constitution 3. It is important, at the outset, to reproduce Article 19 of the Indian Constitution which reads as follows: F “19(1) All citizens shall have the right— (a) to freedom of speech and expression; (b) to assemble peaceably and without arms; (c) to form associations or unions; G (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India; (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; 2 (2011) 3 SCC 377 3 (2011) 3 SCC 380 H 4 Arup Bhuyan, Paragraph 12.
