In an age where there is widespread reporting of every proceeding which takes place in the Court, particularly in the context of live streaming which is intended to provide access to justice to citizens, it is all the more necessary that Judges should exercise due restraint and responsibility in the observations which are made in the course of proceedings. Observations of the nature which have proliferated in the video of the proceedings of the Single Judge can cause incalculable harm to the sanctity of the judicial process. We hope and trust that circumspection shall be exercised in the future. 10. We are not inclined to issue notice to the Single Judge of the High Court whose observations form the subject matter of the dated 17 July 2024. Doing so would place the Judge in a situation of being subject to a judicial adjudication or inquiry by this Court, which we are inclined to desist from doing, at this stage. However, this Court in the exercise of its affirmative obligations as the custodian of the adjudicatory process would be failing in its duty if it were not to intervene by expunging the remarks which were made in the dated 17 July 2024. The observations in the dated 17 July 2024 are accordingly expunged with an expression of caution. We hope that it would not be necessary for this Court to intervene any such 954 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports matter in the future either in relation to the same Judge or any other Judge in the country. 10. The present proceedings are accordingly disposed of. Result of the case: Proceedings Disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Himanshu Rai, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Shibani Ghosh, Adv.)
