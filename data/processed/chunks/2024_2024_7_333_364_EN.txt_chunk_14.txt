It is not in dispute that Shamlal Garg was not examined as a witness in the case and that Section 161 CrPC statements of Mahesh Garg(PW-1) and Sachin Garg(PW-2) were recorded as late as on 20th April, 2003. Thus, there is a glaring omission manifest from the [2024] 7 S.C.R. 353 Gaurav Maini v. The State of Haryana evidence of the Investigating Officer(PW-37) which shows that even after the police officials had contacted the family members of the kidnapped boy on 15th April, 2003, no details were provided by them regarding the alleged incident of kidnapping of Sachin Garg(PW-2) on 2nd April, 2003 or that he was got released after paying ransom to the tune of Rs. 1 crore. This manifest lacuna in the prosecution story is another indication that the entire case is nothing but a cock and bull story. 37. The decision of Investigating Officer(PW-37) in abruptly proceeding to the Bharti Airtel Company, Mohali for verifying the mobile numbers without even requiring Shamlal Garg to file a formal complaint regarding the alleged incident of kidnapping and without recording the statement of the kidnapped boy-Sachin Garg(PW-2), brings the conduct of the Investigating Officer(PW-37) under a cloud of doubt. Shamlal Garg’s statement should have put the Investigating Officer(PW-37) on a high degree of alert and his first reaction and lawful obligation would have been to immediately make enquiry from the allegedly kidnapped boy Sachin Garg(PW-2). However, the Investigating Officer(PW-37) delayed recording his statement for almost five days. 38. The Investigating Officer(PW-37) stated that he again went to Kothi No. 81-A, Panchkula on 20th April, 2003 and on that day, he recorded the statements of Mahesh Garg(PW-1) and Sachin Garg(PW-2) under Section 161 CrPC whereafter, offences punishable under Sections 342, 364A, 392 and 506 IPC were added to the case. This gross delay on part of the police officials in collecting tangible evidence regarding the so-called kidnapping and release of Sachin Garg(PW-2) after paying ransom amount is a grave indication of unnatural conduct which has to be kept in mind while appreciating the evidence of the star prosecution witness. In the later part of his examination-in-chief, the Investigating Officer(PW-37) stated about the further steps of investigation including the arrest of the accused, recording of their disclosure statements, recovery of currency notes and other incriminating articles in the sequence which have been narrated supra at Para No.13 of this . 39. In cross-examination, the Investigating Officer(PW-37) stated that after the investigation of the case was entrusted to him, he went to the house of Mahesh Garg(PW-1) on 15th April, 2003. A zimni 354 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports was recorded in the case file to the effect that Jai Singh, SI(PW-27) had visited the house of Mahesh Garg(PW-1) on 15th April 2003 at about 8:00 pm to make enquiry about the case from Mahesh Garg(PW-1). Admittedly, the statement of Mahesh Garg(PW-1) was never recorded by Jai Singh(PW-27) under Section 161 CrPC. The Investigating Officer(PW-37) further stated that he reached the house of Mahesh Garg(PW-1) at about 10:00 pm on the very same day, the investigation of the case was assigned to him, but Mahesh Garg(PW-1) was not available at that time.
