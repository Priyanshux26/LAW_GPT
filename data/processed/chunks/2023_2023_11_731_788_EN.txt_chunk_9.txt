There is nothing in Clause 35 of the Bye- Laws to have an overriding eff ect on Clause 34 regarding retirement age. (iii) Clause 47 of the Bye-Laws makes it clear that for the matters not specifi cally provided in the Bye-Laws, the rules applicable to the government employees would apply. But since there is a specifi c provision regarding superannuation in Clause 34, the rules governing government servants in respect of superannuation will not be applicable to the employees of the Council unless it is in accordance with Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws. (iv) There is nothing in the Cabinet resolution in question and in the amended FR-56(bb) to show that these decisions are applicable to the employees of the autonomous institutions. The assumption of the respondent No. 1 that the FR-56, as amended from time to time, is automatically applicable to the Council employees is not correct since 746 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. it is subject to the provisions of Clauses 34 & 35 respectively of the Bye-Laws. (v) There is nothing wrong with the clarification letter dated 31.10.2017. It cannot be stated to be overriding the Cabinet decision in question, and the objection to the letter on that ground is not sustainable. The clarifi cation letter was circulated by the Council by a subsequent letter dated 25.01.2018 among its offi cers, after issuance of the fi rst amendment to FR-56. This implies that the Council, which is the employer of the respondent No.1, had consciously accepted the clarifi cation of the Ministry. The respondent No. 1 had not challenged the Council’s letter dated 25.01.2018 but had only challenged the AYUSH Ministry’s letter dated. 31.10.2017. (vi) There is nothing in the pleadings of the respondent No.1 to show that the amended FR-56(bb) is applicable to the employees of the Council, except for citing the provisions of the Bye-Laws. As per Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws, the rules governing the retirement of the government employees will be applicable to the employees of the Council as adopted by the Governing Body. This means that the unless the Governing Body adopts the changes in rules for the retirement of government servants, such changes are not automatically applicable to the employees of the Council. (vii) The CAT placed reliance on the decision of this Court in DDA v. Joint Action Committee, Allottee of SFS Flats, reported in (2008) 2 SCC 672 to hold that there are certain specifi c grounds on which a policy decision can be subjected to judicial review, and in this situation there was no valid ground to challenge the policy decision of the AYUSH Ministry as per the clarifi cation letter dated 31.10.2017. (viii) In the last, the CAT considered that even if the respondent No.1’s contention that he had treated patients was to be accepted, such acceptance could not have negated the decision taken by the Ministry of AYUSH in its clarifi cation letter dated 31.01.2017, which was further accepted by the Council in its subsequent letter dated 25.01.2018.
