In the light of these guiding principles, we will have to consider the present case.” In the background, we have analysed the evidence and the testimonies of the witnesses. 29. There is a yawning gap between the charge against the Appellant and the evidence that the prosecution has adduced. The circumstances do not establish the guilt of the Appellant at all. While the principle applicable to circumstantial evidence requires that the facts must be consistent with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, in the present case the evidence adduced gives rise to doubts, improbabilities and inconsistencies. 30. Having considered the matter in detail and having noted the various discrepancies and improbabilities, we are of the firm view that the prosecution has not established its case beyond reasonable doubt. The Appellant is entitled to be acquitted. 31. We, therefore, allow Criminal Appeal No. 1338 of 2010 and set aside the of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Pradeep Kumar & Anr. v. State of Haryana in Crl. Appeal No. 805-DB of 2007 dated 05.09.2009 and the of the Court of 318 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
