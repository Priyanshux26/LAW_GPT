177. In 1963, the Report of the Santhanam Committee on Prevention of Corruption highlighted the prevalence of corruption at high political levels due to unregulated collection of funds and electioneering by political parties. '”® The Committee suggested “a total ban on all donations by incorporated bodies to political parties.” Subsequently, Section 293A of the 1956 Act was amended through the Companies (Amendment) Act 1969 to prohibit companies from contributing funds to any political party or to any individual or body for any political purpose. 178. In 1985, Parliament again amended Section 293A, in the process reversing its previous ban on political contributions by companies. It allowed a company, other than a government company and any other company with less than three years of existence, to contribute any amount or amounts to any political party or to any person for any political purpose. It further provided that the aggregate of amounts which may be contributed by a company in any financial year shall not exceed five percent of its average net profits during the three immediately preceding financial years. This provision was retained under Section 182 of the Companies Act 2013. The only change was that the aggregate amount donated by a company was increased to seven and a half percent of its average net profits during the three immediately preceding financial years. Section 154 of the Finance Act 2017 amended Section 182 of the 2013 Act to delete this limit contained in the first proviso of the provision. 178 Report of the Committee on Prevention of Corruption, 1964 [11.5]. [2024] 2 S.C.R. 540 Digital Supreme Court Reports 179. At the outset, it is important to be mindful of the fact that the petitioners are not challenging the vires of Section 182 of the 2013 Act. Neither are the petitioners challenging the legality of contributions made by companies to political parties. The challenge is restricted to Section 154 of the Finance Act 2017 which amended Section 182 of the 2013 Act. |. The application of the principle of non-arbitrariness 180. The petitioners argue that Section 154 of the Finance Act 2017 violates Article 14 of the Constitution. The primary ground of challenge is that the amendment to Section 182 of the 2013 Act is manifestly arbitrary as it allows companies, including loss-making companies, to contribute unlimited amounts to political parties. It has also been argued that the law now facilitates the creation of shell companies solely for the purposes of contributing funds to political parties. On the other hand, the respondent has questioned the applicability of the doctrine of manifest arbitrariness for invalidating legislation. a. _Arbitrariness as a facet of Article 14 181. At the outset, the relevant question that this Court has to answer is whether a legislative enactment can be challenged on the sole ground of manifest arbitrariness. Article 14 of the Constitution provides that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India. Article 14 is an injunction to both the legislative as well the executive organs of the State to secure to all persons within the territory of India equality before law and equal protection of the laws.
