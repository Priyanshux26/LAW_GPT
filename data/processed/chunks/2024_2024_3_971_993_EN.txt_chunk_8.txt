This principle of pro-enforcement bias was further entrenched by the Supreme Court in Union of India v Vedanta13. 18. At this point, we may also note that Courts in some countries have recognized that when applying their own public policy to Convention Awards, they should give it an international and not a domestic dimension14. The Arbitration legislation in France15, for instance, makes an explicit distinction between national and international public policy, limiting refusal of enforcement only to the latter ground. Scholars have noted that the New York Convention’s structure and objectives argue strongly against the notion that reliance should be placed on local public policies without international limitations.16 The objective behind such a distinction is to make it less difficult to allow enforcement on public policy grounds. Most Courts have interpreted the public policy exception extremely narrowly17. 19. The Indian Supreme Court in Renusagar (supra) had noted that there is no workable definition of international public policy, and “public policy” should thus be construed to be the “public policy of India” by giving it a narrower meaning. Later on, in Shri Lal Mahal Ltd. v Progetto Grano SpA18, the Supreme Court held that the wider meaning given to ‘public policy of India’ in the domestic sphere under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) would not apply where objection is raised to the enforcement of the Award under Section 48(2)(b) of the Indian Arbitration Act. This would indicate that the grounds for resisting enforcement of a foreign award are much narrower than the grounds available for challenging a domestic award under Section 34 of the Indian Arbitration Act. 13 [2020] 12 SCR 1 : (2020) 10 SCC 1 14 Nigel Blackaby KC, and others, Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration (7th Edn, OUP 2022), 594 15 Article 1514 of French Code of Civil Procedure 1981 16 Gary Born, International Commercial Arbitration(3rd ed,2021) 2838; Robert Briner, Philosophy and Objectives of the Convention’ in Enforcing Arbitration Awards under the New York Convention.

At this point, we may also benefit by noting that the International Law Association issued recommendations19 at a conference held in New Delhi in 2002 on international commercial arbitration and advocated using only narrow and international standards, while dealing with “public policy”. The recommendations have been regarded as reflective of best international practices. The ILA also defined international public policy as follows: "(i) fundamental principles, pertaining to justice or morality, that the State wishes to protect even when it is not directly concerned; (ii) rules designed to serve the essential political, social or economic interests of the State, these being known as ‘lois de police’ or ‘public policy rules’; and (iii.) the duty of the State to respect its obligations towards other States or international organizations.” 21.
