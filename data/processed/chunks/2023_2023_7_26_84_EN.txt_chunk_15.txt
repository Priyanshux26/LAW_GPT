26. The submission of the States that there is a paucity of financial resources must be examined from this aspect of the matter. The States and the Union have repeatedly stated that the burden on the financial resources of the States/Union due to the Report of the SNJPC is F significant and therefore the Report cannot be implemented. Without the doctrine of inherent powers, any de-funding of the Judiciary cannot be repelled. 9All India Judges’ Assn. (II) v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 288 at para 7. 10In All India Judges’ Assn. (II) v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 288 at para 10: “It would be against the spirit of the Constitution to deny any role to the judiciary in that G behalf, for theoretically it would not be impossible for the executive or the legislature to turn and twist the tail of the judiciary by using the said power. Such a consequence would be against one of the seminal mandates of the Constitution, namely, to maintain the independence of the judiciary.” 11Commonwealth ex rel Carroll vs. Tate, 274 A.2d. 193. Approved by this Court in Brij Mohan Lal v. Union of India, (2012) 6 SCC 502 at para 110 – 111. H 50 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A 27. Apart from this, Judicial Officers have been working without a pay revision for nearly 15 years. A pay revision has been recommended in accordance with the law laid down by this Court and a report submitted by a Judicial Pay Commission after considering this very objection. This Court has also examined this issue of paucity of financial resources on at least three occasions in these very proceedings. In the dated B 28.02.2020, which took cognizance of the Report of the SNJPC, this Court stated that it hoped that “the same objections, which have been rejected by this Court in All India Judges Association v. Union of India (1993) 4 SCC 288, will not be re-agitated. The Court in the aforesaid observed that compared to the other plan and C non-plan expenditures, the financial burden caused on account of the directions given therein are negligible.” 12 However, the States and the Union raised this objection in their affidavits before this Court. 28. After going through the affidavits of the States and the Union, this Court on 27.07.2022 found that in contrast to the 7th Central Pay D Commission, which was implemented from 01.01.2016, judicial officers have not received any similar benefit. Thus, the Court held that “there is a need to at least implement the revised pay structure immediately so as to alleviate the sufferings of the judicial officers.”13 The Court, after considering the objections of the Union and the State rejected the same and accepted the revision of pay structure as recommended by E the SNJPC. Aggrieved by the acceptance of the Report, the Union filed a review petition before this Court. This Court by dated 05.04.2023 dismissed the review petitions and found that the financial implications cannot be considered as excessive in view of the information given by the SNJPC.14 Still, the States and the Union have raised this objection F after its express rejection twice over.
