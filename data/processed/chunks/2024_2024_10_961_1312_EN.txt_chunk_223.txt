1271 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 government notified the Foreigners 1948.75 In terms of the Foreigners , foreigners can enter India only at such port or other place of entry on the bs of India as the registration officer having jurisdiction at that port or place may appoint.76 The also provides that a foreigner can enter only with the leave of the civil authority having jurisdiction77 and leave will be refused if the foreigner is not in possession of a valid passport or visa.78 Thus, every migrant without a valid visa, irrespective of the country from which they migrated and the Indian State to which they have migrated, was refused permission to enter India. 52. However, the Foreigners Act when it was enacted did not apply to migrants from West and East Pakistan since they were also British subjects. The definition of ‘Foreigner’ in the Act was amended by Act 11 of 1957 to mean a person who is not a citizen of India. This amendment came into force from 19 January 1957.79 Thus, until 1957, the Foreigners Act which provided the Central Government with the power to remove a migrant without legal documentation or place and subject to the observance of such conditions on departure as may be prescribed; (c) shall not remain in [India] or in any prescribed areas therein; [(cc) shall, if he has been required by under this section not to remain in India, meet from any resources at his disposal the cost of his removal from India and of his maintenance therein pending such removal;] (d) shall remove himself to, and remain in, such area in [India] as may be prescribed; (e) shall comply with such conditions as may be prescribed or specified— (i) requiring him to reside in a particular place; (ii) imposing any restrictions on his movements; (iii) requiring him to furnish such proof of his identity and to report such particulars to such authority in such manner and at such time and place as may be prescribed or specified; (iv) requiring him to allow his photograph and finger impressions to be taken and to furnish specimens of his handwriting and signature to such authority and at such time and place as may be prescribed or specified; (v) requiring him to submit himself to such medical examination by such authority and at such time and place as may be prescribed or specified; (vi) prohibiting him from association with persons of a prescribed or specified description; (vii) prohibiting him from engaging in activities of a prescribed or specified description; (viii) prohibiting him from using or possessing prescribed or specified articles; (ix) otherwise regulating his conduct in any such particular as may be prescribed or specified; (f) shall enter into a bond with or without sureties for the due observance of, or as an alternative to the enforcement of, any or all prescribed or specified restrictions or conditions; [(g) shall be arrested and detained or confined;] and may make provision [for any matter which is to be or may be prescribed and] for such incidental and supplementary matters as may, in the opinion of the Central Government, be expedient or necessary for giving effect to this Act.
