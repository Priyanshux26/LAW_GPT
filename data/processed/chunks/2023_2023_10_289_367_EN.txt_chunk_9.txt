*Ed. Note : These were two s in the matter-one by Hon’ble Mr. Justice M.R. H Shah and the other by Hon’ble Mrs. Justice B.V. Nagarathna. ASSOCIATION OF OLD SETTLERS OF SIKKIM AND ORS. v. 301 UNION OF INDIA AND ANR. [M. R. SHAH, J.] Explanation.- For the purposes of this clause, “Sikkimese” shall A mean- (i) an individual, whose name is recorded in the register maintained under the Sikkim Subjects Regulation, 1961 read with the Sikkim Subject Rules, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the “Register of Sikkim Subjects”), immediately before B the 26th day of April, 1975; or (ii) an individual, whose name is included in the Register of Sikkim Subjects by virtue of the Government of India No.26030/36/90-I.C.I., dated the 7th August, 1990 and of even number dated the 8th April, 1991; or C (iii) any other individual, whose name does not appear in the Register of Sikkim Subjects, but it is established beyond doubt that the name of such individual’s father or husband or paternal grand-father or brother from the same father has been recorded in that register;” D 3. It is the case on behalf of the respective writ petitioners that by excluding the Indians from the definition of Sikkimese, the exemption granted under Section 10(26AAA) of the Act 1961, is not available to the Indian Settlers resulting in discrimination. There is no valid ground for discriminating against this section of the residents of Sikkim alone. E Therefore, it is the case on behalf of the writ petitioners that exclusion of Indians who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975 and consequently not granting the exemption granted under Section 10(26AAA) of the Act, 1961 to the class of Indians, who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975 is arbitrary, discriminatory and the differentia do not have a F rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the Statute in question. It is also the case on behalf of the writ petitioners in Writ Petition No. 59 of 2013 that Proviso to Section 10(26AAA), insofar as it excludes from the exempted category, “Sikkimese women” who marries a non- Sikkimese after 01.04.2008, is discriminatory and violative of Articles G 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India as the exclusion is based on gender. 4.
