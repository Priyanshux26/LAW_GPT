2. Further, it is reiterated that this will be the last chance to acquire the requisite minimum professional qualifi cations. Any teacher in the 610 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. aforementioned schools, who does not have the minimum qualifi cations mandated under the RTE Act, 2009, would not be allowed to continue in-service beyond 1st April, 2019, and procedure for dismissal shall be initiated against such teachers.” 23. It is thus clear that all such teachers working in either Government/ Government Aided/Unaided Private Schools, were required to acquire the minimum qualifi cations by 31st March 2019 or they would face dismissal from service. It appears that it was decided by the Central Government to provide a window for all such teachers. A perusal of the said communication would reveal that various directions were issued so that lakhs of teachers, who were untrained, get the requisite qualifi cations prior to 1st April 2019. The communication addressed by the Director, Elementary Education, Uttarakhand dated 8th September 2017 to the Chief Education Offi cer and District Education Offi cer, Uttarakhand would further clarify this position. 24. It appears that, in furtherance of the directions issued by MHRD, NCTE issued recognition on 22nd September 2017. It will be relevant to refer to the Preamble of the said recognition , which reads thus: “WHEREAS, the matter of recognition of the Project Proposal of National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) Noida for D.EI.Ed.
