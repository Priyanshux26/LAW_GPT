ISSUES THAT ARISE FOR CONSIDERATION 20. Having considered the rival submissions, the issues that arise for our consideration are: (i) Whether a Constable of a Railway Protection Force (RPF) can be treated as a “Workman” under Section 2(1)(n) of the 1923 Act 668 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. even though, by virtue of amended Section 3 of the 1957 Act, he is a member of the Armed Forces of the Union? (ii) Whether, on account of availability of alternative remedy to apply for compensation under Sections 124 and 124-A of the 1989 Act, a claim under the 1923 Act is maintainable? DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 21. Before we dwell on the aforesaid issues, a look at the relevant statutory provisions would be apposite. The relevant provisions, interplay of which would have to be examined, are found in the following statutes: (i) The Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 (Now known as Employee’s Compensation Act, 1923) (in short, “the 1923 Act). (ii) The Indian Railways Act, 1890 (in short “the 1890 Act”). (iii) The Railways Act, 1989 (in short “the 1989 Act”). (iv) Railway Protection Force Act, 1957 (in short, “the 1957 Act”). Relevant Provisions of the 1923 Act 22. The preamble of the 1923 Act reads thus: “An Act to provide for the payment by certain classes of employers to their workmen (now substituted by the word ‘employees’) of compensation for injury by accident.” 23. Clause (n) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 1923 Act, as it stood before its omission by Act No.45 of 2009, w.e.f. 18.01.2010, which is relevant to the controversy at hand, reads as under: “(n) “workman” means any person who is— (i) a railway servant as defi ned in clause (34) of section 2 of the Railways Act, 1989 (24 of 1989), not permanently employed in any administrative, district or sub-divisional offi cer of a railway and not employed in any such capacity as is specifi ed in Schedule II, or (ia) (a) a master, seaman or other member of the crew of a ship, (b) a captain or other member of the crew of an aircraft, COMMANDING OFFICER, RAILWAY PROTECTION SPECIAL FORCE, 669 MUMBAI v. BHAVNABEN DINSHBHAI BHABHOR & OTHERS [MANOJ MISRA, J.] (c) a person recruited as driver, helper, mechanic, cleaner or in any other capacity in connection with a motor vehicle, (d) a person recruited for work abroad by a company, and who is employed outside India in any such capacity as is specifi ed in Schedule II and the ship, aircraft or motor vehicle, or company, as the case may be, is registered in India, or (ii) employed in any such capacity as is specifi ed in Schedule II, whether the contract of employment was made before or after the passing of this Act and whether such contract is expressed or implied, oral or in writing; but does not include any person working in the capacity of a member of the Armed Forces of the Union; and any reference to a workman who has been injured shall, where the workman is dead, include a reference to his dependents or any of them.” Note: The highlighted portion above, when originally enacted read as “but does not include any person working in the capacity of a member of His Majesty’s naval, military or air forces or of the Royal Indian Marine Service”.
