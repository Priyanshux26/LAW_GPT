Rejection of mercy petitions was illegal on account of non- application of mind due to non-placement of relevant information before the concerned authorities; and, v. The Sessions Court, Pune, issued death warrants without notice to the convicts or their family members. 10. Counter affidavits were filed in the writ petitions before the High Court by various officers. By the impugned dated 29th July 2019, the High Court held that there was an undue and avoidable delay in executing the death sentence. Moreover, the convicts were kept in solitary confinement from 20th March 2012. Therefore, the High Court proceeded to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment for a total period of thirty-five years. The warrants for the execution of the death sentence issued by the learned Sessions Court, Pune, were set aside. SUBMISSIONS 11. Mr Shreeyash Lalit, the learned counsel representing the appellants, made detailed submissions. He referred to a decision of this Court in the case of T.V.Vatheesswaran v. State of Tamil Nadu.1 He also pointed out a decision of the three Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Sher Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab.2 He pointed out that in the case of T.V. Vatheesswaran,1 it was held that a delay beyond two years in the execution of the death sentence was enough to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment. However, in the case of Sher Singh & Ors,2 it was held that a delay of two years is not enough for the commutation of a death sentence. Ultimately, this conflict was resolved by a decision by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Triveniben v. State of Gujarat.3 He also pointed out various decisions of this Court in the cases of Shatrughan Chauhan & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.,4 Ajay Kumar Pal v. 1 [1983] 2 SCR 348 : (1983) 2 SCC 68 2 [1983] 2 SCR 582 : (1983) 2 SCC 344 3 [1989] 1 SCR 509 : (1989) 1 SCC 678 4 [2014] 1 SCR 609 : (2014) 3 SCC 1 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 585 State of Maharashtra & Ors. v. Pradeep Yashwant Kokade & Anr. Union of India & Anr,5 Mukesh v. Union of India & Ors.6 and B.A. Umesh v. Union of India & Ors.7 He submitted that though undue delay in the execution of a death sentence will entitle convicts to seek commutation, no fixed period of delay can be laid down as a criterion for commutation. He submitted that in such a case, the twin test must be satisfied. The first test is whether there was an avoidable delay. The second test is whether the quantum of delay was unduly long or inordinate, which must warrant the commutation of a death sentence to life imprisonment. The learned counsel urged that both the tests must be satisfied to make out a case for commutation of a death sentence. He submitted that neither of these two tests alone would be sufficient to commute the death sentence.
