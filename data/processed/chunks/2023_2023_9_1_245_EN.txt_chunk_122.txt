A AIR 1963 SC 996] and A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak [(1988) 2 SCC 602 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 372] , where the Court observed that though the powers conferred on this Court under Article 142(1) are very wide, but in exercise of that power the Court cannot make any plainly inconsistent with the express statutory provisions of substantive law. It may be noticed that in Prem Chand B Garg [1963 Supp 1 SCR 885, 899 : AIR 1963 SC 996] and Antulay case [(1988) 2 SCC 602 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 372] observations with regard to the extent of this Court’s power under Article 142(1) were made in the context of fundamental rights. Those observations have no bearing on the question in issue as there is C no provision in any substantive law restricting this Court’s power to quash proceedings pending before subordinate court. This Court’s power under Article 142(1) to do “complete justice” is entirely of different level and of a different quality. Any prohibition or restriction contained in ordinary laws cannot act as a limitation on the constitutional power of this Court. Once this Court has D seisin of a cause or matter before it, it has power to issue any or direction to do “complete justice” in the matter. This constitutional power of the Apex Court cannot be limited or restricted by provisions contained in statutory law. In Harbans Singh v. State of U.P. [(1982) 2 SCC 101 : 1982 SCC (Cri) 361 : E (1982) 3 SCR 235, 243] , A.N. Sen, J. in his concurring opinion observed: (SCC pp. 107-08, para 20) “Very wide powers have been conferred on this Court for due and proper administration of justice. Apart from the jurisdiction and powers conferred on this Court under Articles 32 and 136 of F the Constitution I am of the opinion that this Court retains and must retain, an inherent power and jurisdiction for dealing with any extraordinary situation in the larger interests of administration of justice and for preventing manifest injustice being done. This power must necessarily be sparingly used only in exceptional circumstances for furthering the ends of justice.” G No enactment made by Central or State legislature can limit or restrict the power of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution, though while exercising power under Article 142 of the Constitution, the Court must take into consideration the statutory provisions regulating the matter in dispute. What would be the need of H ANOOP BARANWAL v. UNION OF INDIA 165 [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] “complete justice” in a cause or matter would depend upon the A facts and circumstances of each case and while exercising that power the Court would take into consideration the express provisions of a substantive statute. Once this Court has taken seisin of a case, cause or matter, it has power to pass any or issue direction as may be necessary to do complete justice in the B matter. This has been the consistent view of this Court as would appear from the decisions of this Court in State of U.P.
