They could not have created any deviations, alterations or modifications of the terms of the Resolution Plan. It is in this context that the submission of the SRA that, the Lender’s Affidavit required an infusion of Rs. 350 Crore in cash, while the Resolution Plan allowed for the payment of Rs. 200 Crore in cash and Rs. 150 Crore through adjustment of the PBG, must be rejected. Both the Resolution Plan and the Lender’s Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 reflected the same terms i.e., infusion “in cash” of the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore. In fact, even the date within which the Lender’s Affidavit required Rs. 350 Crore to be infused in cash i.e., 31.08.2023 was in compliance with the dated 26.05.2023 passed by the NCLAT granting the 2nd Implementation Extension. Therefore, no new terms were cast on the SRA. 118. The fact that the Lender’s Affidavit did not impose any condition which was different from that contemplated under the Resolution 2134 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Plan, was also understood by all the parties involved, including the SRA. This is evident from the arguments put forth by the SRA, before the NCLAT and before this Court respectively, which dealt with the issue of whether the adjustment of the PBG was possible under the terms of the Lender’s Affidavit. The following were the submissions made by the SRA in the dated 28.08.2023 as recorded by the NCLAT: “20. Learned Sr. Counsel for the SRA has submitted that approved Resolution Plan provides adjustment of Performance Bank Guarantee towards first tranche of payment whereas Learned Counsel for the Appellants has referred to certain clauses of RFRP and also provisions of Regulation 36B (4A) to support his submission that performance bank guarantee cannot be permitted to be invoked towards payment of first tranche.” (emphasis supplied) 119. The submissions made by the SRA as recorded in the of this Court dated 18.01.2024 are as follows: “18. The submission which has been urged on behalf of the lenders has been opposed on behalf of the SRA by Mr. Krishnendu Datta, senior counsel, on behalf of the SRA, it has been submitted that: (i) The Resolution Plan specifically contemplates the adjustment of the PBG (originally of Rs. 47.5 crores, subsequently enhanced to Rs. 150 crores). In support of this submission, reliance has been placed on the summary of payments and security package forming a part of clause 6.4.4 of the Resolution Plan; (ii) The SRA was in the first tranche required to pay an amount of up to Rs. 185 crores against the creation of securities, namely, (i) PBG of Rs. 47.5 crores; (ii) BKC Property (if given); and (iii) Mortgage over Dubai Property No 1 valued at over Rs. 100 crores. In the last column of the table, it has been stipulated that the securities would be released, as indicated; (iii) The PBG was liable to be adjusted against the cash payment of the first tranche of Rs. 185 crores; [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2135 State Bank of India & Ors.
