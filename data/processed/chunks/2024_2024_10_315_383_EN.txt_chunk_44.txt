To escape liability, they will have to prove that when the offence was committed, they had no knowledge of the offence or that they exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence.” [See also: N. Rangachari v. BSNL;70 Central Bank of India v. Asian Global Ltd.;71 Gunmala Sales (P) Ltd. v. Anu Mehta;72 and Rajesh Viren Shah v. Redington India Ltd.73] 50. Turning our attention to the facts of the present case once more, we find that in opposing the stand that he is a director, the appellant submits that he, in fact, is an uneducated person who is a munshi and whose identity has been stolen by A-7 & A-14. That being the case, this Court cannot, at this stage, decide whether Section 22A applies to the appellant or not. This is once again a matter for evidence. CONCLUSION 51. Consequent to the discussion made herein above, the conclusions drawn by this Court in respect of the questions of law for our consideration, are as under: 51.1 The validity of sanction should be challenged at the earliest instance available, before the Trial Court. If such a challenge is raised at an appellate stage it would be for the person raising the challenge to justify the reasons for bringing the same at 70 [2007] 5 SCR 329 : (2007) 5 SCC 108 71 [2010] 7 SCR 694 : (2010) 11 SCC 203 72 [2014] 10 SCR 1117 : (2015) 1 SCC 103 73 (2024) 4 SCC 305 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 383 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. a belated stage. Such reasons would have to be considered independently so as to ensure that there is no misuse of the right of challenge with the aim to stall or delay proceedings. 51.2 The timelines mentioned in Rules 3 & 4 of the 2008 Rules are couched in mandatory language and, therefore, have to be strictly followed. This is keeping in view that UAPA being a penal legislation, strict construction must be accorded to it. Timelines imposed by way of statutory Rules are a way to keep a check on executive power which is a necessary position to protect the rights of accused persons. Independent review by both the authority recommending sanction and the authority granting sanction, are necessary aspects of compliance with Section 45 of the UAPA. 52. For the next two questions, which depend on analysis of facts for their conclusions, their answers are as below : 52.1 Sections 218-222, CrPC, are not violated. In respect of Section 223, the position of law is the one taken in Paras Nath Singh (supra). Therefore, this Court prudently leaves it for the Trial Court to decide, if such an issue is raised before it. 52.2 Whether or not the exemption under Section 22A applies is a matter to be established by the way of evidence for the person claiming such exemption has to demonstrate that either he was not in charge of the affairs of the company which has allegedly committed the offence, or that he had made reasonable efforts to prevent the commission of the offence.
