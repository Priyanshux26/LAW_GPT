But in this case the Full Court of the High Court did not consider the enquiry report and did not take a decision in advance to impose the penalty of removal from service. 21. As a matter of fact, the history of evolution of law relating to E second show cause notice is almost forty years old. The requirement of a second show cause notice relating to the proposed penalty was removed from Article 311 of the Constitution by the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976. The same was upheld by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Union of Indiaand Anr. vs. Tulsiram Patel2. However, a two- member Bench of this Court opened a small window in Union of India F and Ors. vs. E. Bashyan3, which led to the decision in Union of India and Ors. vs. Mohd. Ramzan Khan4, wherein this Court held that the opportunity to respond to the findings of the inquiry officer is different from the opportunity to respond to the penalty proposed. Eventually, the issue got clarified in The Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad and G Ors. vs. B. Karunakar and Ors.5. 1 (2017) 1 SCC 768 2 (1985) 3 SCC 398 3 (1988) 2 SCC 196 4 (1991) 1 SCC 588 5 (1993) 4 SCC 727 H 62 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 22. It is not the case of the respondent that the Full Court of the High Court took a decision to impose the penalty of dismissal from service even before furnishing the copies of the enquiry reports to the respondent. The show cause notices enclosing the enquiry reports, are dated 11.10.2007. The representations made by the respondent are dated 26.10.2007. It is only thereafter that the Administrative Committee No.1 B considered the matter on 28.08.2008 and it was placed before the Full Court on 04.10.2008. Therefore, the opinion of the High Court that the second show cause notices were in violation of the principles of natural justice is not factually and legally correct. 23. We have not come across a case where the High Court, while C setting aside an of penalty has held that there shall not be any further inquiry against the delinquent. But in this case, the High Court has done exactly the same, creating a new jurisprudence. The relevant portion of the impugned of the High Court reads as follows:- “Writ Appeal is allowed. Impugned passed by the learned D Single Judge in W.P.Nos.10756/2009 & 11030-32 of 2009 (S.DIS) dated 30.11.2011 is hereby set aside. Punishment dismissing the appellant from service is hereby quashed. All Inquiry reports are quashed. There shall not be any further enquiry against the appellant. The appellant is to be treated as if he had been in service E till the date of superannuation and pay all consequential monetary benefits with interest at 8% p.a. The compliance shall be within a period of three months.” 24. For all the above reasons, the appeals are liable to be allowed. Accordingly, they are allowed and the impugned of the Division Bench of the High Court is set aside.
