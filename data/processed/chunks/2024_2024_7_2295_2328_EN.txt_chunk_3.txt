[Para 33.13] Principles/Doctrines – Doctrine of bona fide purchaser – Applicability in case of subsequent purchaser: Held: The doctrine of bona fide purchaser for value applies in situations where the seller appears to have some semblance of legitimate ownership rights – However, this principle does not protect a subsequent purchaser if the vendor had already transferred those rights through a prior sale deed – In a case where the vendor deceitfully executes a second sale deed 26 years after the initial transfer, without disclosing the earlier transaction and without any ongoing litigation regarding the property, the subsequent purchaser cannot claim the benefits of a bona fide purchaser – Essentially, if the vendor’s rights were already severed by the first sale, any later sale deed made without transparency and in bad faith is invalid – The subsequent purchaser, even if unaware of the prior sale, cannot be considered bona fide because the vendor no longer had the legal right to sell the property – Thus, the protection afforded by the bona fide purchaser doctrine is nullified by the vendor’s deceitful conduct and the pre-existing transfer of rights – This ensures that the original purchaser’s rights are upheld and prevents unjust enrichment through fraudulent transactions.
