It stipulates that if an individual whose land is acquired receives enhanced compensation, all other affected persons covered by the same notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act are entitled to seek parity with such enhancement. 12 [2023] 6 SCR 209 : 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1090, para 113 464 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 51. This provision was not originally a part of the 1894 Act and was introduced through the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984. The Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the aforementioned Amendment Act, clarified that Section 28A aimed to rectify disparities between landowners. It addressed situations where more affluent landowners could avail themselves of a reference to the civil court under Section 18, while inarticulate and poor people often could not resort to a similar recourse, resulting in inequality in compensation for similar quality of land. The provision sought to remedy this by allowing all affected parties covered by the same notification to seek redetermination of compensation once the court grants higher compensation under Section 18 to any one of them.13 52. In the instant case, however, we are not delving deep into the landowners’ prayer for parity based on Section 28A of the 1894 Act in consonance with the Bir Singh (supra) judgement. We do so for three reasons: (a) that as mentioned in para 22 of this judgement, Bir Singh (supra) would not bind us given its precarious and sui generis facts; (b) the landowners have not demonstrated compliance with the procedural technicalities of this provision, such as writing to the Collector within the prescribed limitation period; and (c) the issue is rendered academic in light of our analysis above where we have independently revised the rate of compensation to INR 403 per sq. yd for one and all. 53. Similarly, the plea hovering around Article 14 of the Constitution to seek uniformity in the matter of award of compensation, has also become academic, as such a relief already stands granted to all the landowners, though on different grounds. F. Conclusion 54. The present factual situation had three set of cases – appeals filed by the landowners, appeals filed by NOIDA, and the Miscellaneous Applications filed by the landowners. Without disturbing the ratio of Bir Singh (supra) and the compensation granted to landowners therein, and with a view to put a quietus on this long-standing dispute, the landowners’ appeals are allowed in part; the appeals by NOIDA 13 Mewa Ram v.
