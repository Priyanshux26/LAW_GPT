[Paras 120, 122, 124, 125, 128, 129] Limitation Act, 1963 – s. 18 – Effect of acknowledgment in writing – Extension of the period of limitation – Minutes of meeting, if extended the limitation of counterclaims: 496 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: To extend the period of limitation with the aid of s. 18, the acknowledgment must involve an admission of a subsisting jural relationship between the parties and a conscious affirmation of an intention of continuing such relationship regarding an existing liability – Such intention can be gathered from the nature of the admission – Admission need not be express, or regarding a precise amount, but must be made in circumstances and in words from which the court can reasonably infer that the person making the admission intended to refer to a subsisting liability as on the date of the statement – However, where an acknowledgement is in respect of a specified sum of money or a specific right only, and not in general terms, it would extend the period of limitation only in respect thereof, and not of other claims which, though may have arisen out of same jural relationship, are not specified therein – On facts, minutes of meeting did not extend the limitation of counterclaims – Minutes of meeting made no reference to the items referable to counterclaims-cost of repair/replacement of Gear Box and Fan Modules – Also no acknowledgment in general terms in regard to liabilities subsisting under the contract – Said minutes could not be treated as acknowledgment for the purpose of extending limitation of the counterclaims not specified therein – Thus, when the counterclaims were otherwise barred by limitation on the date of filing of counterclaim, the tribunal justified in rejecting them as barred by limitation. [Paras 137, 138] Limitation Act, 1963 – Rejection of claimant’s prayer to declare debit notes invalid, if had adversely affected the claim for the outstanding principal amount in respect of the goods supplied/ work done under the contract : Held: Rejection of prayer to declare debit notes invalid did not affect respondent’s claim for the outstanding principal amount – Relief for declaratory relief was rightly held barred by limitation by the tribunal – Rejection of declaratory relief did not impact relief for compensation, since relief for compensation was not a consequential relief, dependent on debit notes being declared invalid because issuance of debit notes was a unilateral act of the employer which on its own did not extinguish the right of the contractor – No doubt, where the relief sought is consequential to the declaration, and declaratory relief is found barred by time, the prayer for consequential relief will also fail – But where declaration is just an optional relief-on which the main relief is not dependent, [2024] 9 S.C.R. 497 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. rejection of it as barred by limitation would not extinguish the claim in respect of which substantive relief is sought – In such circumstances, it was open for the contractor to sue for its dues without seeking a declaration qua the debit notes – Thus, rejection of the declaratory relief as barred by limitation, did not have a material bearing on respondent’s claim against the appellants’ for the outstanding principal amount payable under the contract – Amount, as shown debited in the debit notes, was not to be automatically adjusted against the principal outstanding amount payable to respondent – While deciding the claim of respondent, the tribunal was well within its remit to adjudicate upon the issue whether such amount should be adjusted or not against the outstanding principal amount payable to respondent – No perversity in the award on this count.
