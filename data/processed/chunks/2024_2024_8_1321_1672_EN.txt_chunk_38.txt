Thus, Article 335 is not a limitation on the exercise of power under Articles 16(1) and 16(4). Rather, it is a restatement of the necessity of considering the claims of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in public services. Efficiency of administration must not be viewed in terms of the narrow lense of scores in an examination which a priori excludes certain classes but in terms of inclusivity and equality as required by Article 16(1). 91 See Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [835]; M Nagaraj v. Union of India (2006) 8 SCC 212 [108] 1374 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 70. This Court has previously challenged the binary of reservation and merit. In Devadasan (supra), Justice Subba Rao observed that there is no conflict between the provisions of Articles 16(4) and 335 and that the latter has no bearing on the interpretation of the former. Justice Rao observed that the former provision, is directory while the latter is a mandatory provision by which the State is required to consider the “claims”92 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.93 Subsequently, in Vasanth Kumar (supra) Justice Chinnappa Reddy echoed this view. The learned Judge observed that reservation cannot be viewed as a conflict between the principles of merit and distributive justice. It is rather, the conflict between the haves and the have-nots.94 71. This line of reasoning was furthered in BK Pavitra (II) v. State of Karnataka,95 where this Court observed that the assumption of the critiques of reservation is that awarding opportunities in government services based on “merit” results in an increase in administrative efficiency.96 In BK Pavitra (II) (supra) and Neil Aurelio Nunes v. Union of India,97 this Court highlighted the folly of measuring “merit” based on the performance of candidates in a seemingly “neutral” selection process which is factually not neutral since the process does not provide equal opportunity to candidates belonging to classes which face widespread inequalities in accessing facilities required to ace the examinations.98 In Neil Aurelio Nunes (supra), a two- Judge Bench of this Court discussed the privileges that accrue to the advanced classes in the form of cultural capital which ensures that a child is unconsciously trained by the familial environment and the economic capital: “24. […] the privileges that accrue to forward classes are not limited to having access to quality schooling and access to tutorials and coaching centres to prepare for 92 Justice Krishna Iyer in NM Thomas (supra) observed that the usage of the phrase ‘claims’ in Article 335 indicates that reservation is a right and not the provision of charity or benevolence.
