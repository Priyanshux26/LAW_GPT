Digital Supreme Court Reports the second purchaser who was mentioned as a minor in the sale deed was represented through his natural guardian and mother – The respondent no.2 appears to be a dishonest person, which is apparent from his conduct not only during the trial but also acting in collusion with respondent no.1 to execute the sale deed for the same land which he had already transferred – Thus, the impugned judgement of the High Court is set aside and that of the first Appellate Court decreeing suit of the appellant is restored and maintained. [Paras 29, 30, 33.1,33.2, 33.6, 33.8, 33.9, 33.12, 33.13] Contract Act, 1872 – s.11 – Registration Act, 1908 – s.85 – Whether the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 was executed by Respondent No. 2: Held: It is not disputed by respondent No.2 that on 02.12.1985, he had executed another sale deed with respect to the remaining portion of survey No.13/1 in favour of the collaterals of the appellants – This sale deed in favour of the collateral was presented for registration on the same date as the sale deed of the appellant i.e. 05.12.1985 and was thereafter duly registered – The respondent No.2 has never challenged the said sale deed in favour of the collaterals – It is thus apparent that the family members and collaterals of the appellants purchased the entire survey No. 13/1 measuring 3.40 Hectares from respondent No.2 in equal shares by two separate documents which were executed on the same date and presented for registration on the same day – There is no specific denial in the written statement filed by respondent No.2 about the sale deed in favour of collaterals – General denial has been made by placing strict proof of liability on the plaintiff. [Para 33.1] Registration Act, 1908 – Transfer of Property Act, 1882 – Registration of documents/sale deed – Payment of stamp duty – Deficiency of stamp duty – Deficiency of stamp duty cannot enure any benefit to the vendor: Held: The issue of registration of a document is with the State, which requires compulsory registration of documents so that it is not deprived of revenue by way of stamp duty payable on such transfers of immovable property – If the purchaser has no means to pay stamp duty or exorbitant demand of stamp duty is made by the registering authority which the purchaser is unable to pay at that time but he remains satisfied with the fact that the vendor has fairly and duly executed the sale deed presented it for registration and put him in possession of the purchased property which he is [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2299 Kaushik Premkumar Mishra & Anr. v. Kanji Ravaria @ Kanji & Anr. peacefully enjoying, he is always at liberty to pay the deficiency of stamp duty at any point of time – The document presented for registration will remain with the Registering Authority till such time, the deficiency is removed – However, this pendency of registration on account of deficiency cannot enure any benefit to the vendor, who has already eliminated all his rights by executing the sale deed after receiving the sale consideration – He cannot become the owner of the transferred land merely because the document of sale is pending for registration – It is the purchaser who cannot produce such document which is pending registration with respect to the immovable property in evidence before the Court of law as the same would be inadmissible in view of statutory provision contained in the TP Act as also the Act, 1908.
