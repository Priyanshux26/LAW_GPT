[Para 49] Representation of the People Act, 1951 – Election – Filing of nomination – Whether every defect in the nomination can straightaway termed to be of such character as to render its acceptance improper: [2024] 4 S.C.R. 397 Karikho Kri v. Nuney Tayang and Another Held: Every defect in the nomination cannot straightaway be termed to be of such character as to render its acceptance improper and each case would have to turn on its own individual facts, insofar as that aspect is concerned – This Court has always drawn a distinction between non-disclosure of substantial issues as opposed to insubstantial issues, which may not impact one’s candidature or the result of an election – The very fact that Section 36(4) of the Act of 1951 speaks of the Returning Officer not rejecting a nomination unless he is of the opinion that the defect is of a substantial nature demonstrates that this distinction must always be kept in mind and there is no absolute mandate that every non-disclosure, irrespective of its gravity and impact, would automatically amount to a defect of substantial nature, thereby materially affecting the result of the election or amounting to ‘undue influence’ so as to qualify as a corrupt practice. [Para 40] Representation of the People Act, 1951 – Voter’s right to know – Absolute or not: Held: A blanket proposition that a candidate is required to lay his life out threadbare for examination by the electorate is not accepted – His ‘right to privacy’ would still survive as regards matters which are of no concern to the voter or are irrelevant to his candidature for public office – In that respect, non-disclosure of each and every asset owned by a candidate would not amount to a defect, much less, a defect of a substantial character – It is not necessary that a candidate declare every item of movable property that he or his dependent family members owns, unless the same is of such value as to constitute a sizeable asset in itself or reflect upon his candidature, in terms of his lifestyle, and require to be disclosed – Every case would have to turn on its own peculiarities and there can be no hard and fast or straitjacketed rule as to when the non-disclosure of a particular movable asset by a candidate would amount to a defect of a substantial character. [Para 44] Representation of the People Act, 1951 – s.100(1)(d)(iv) – Election invalidation under: Held: In the instant case, the High Court linked all the non- disclosures attributed to KK to s.100(1)(d)(i) of the Act of 1951 but ultimately concluded that his election stood invalidated u/s. 100(1) (d)(iv) thereof – There is no discussion whatsoever on what were the violations which qualified as non-compliance with the provisions of either the Constitution or the Act of 1951 or the rules and s 398 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports framed thereunder, for the purposes of s.100(1)(d)(iv), and as to how the same materially affected the result of the election – For the election petitioner to succeed on such ground, viz., s.100 (1)(d) (iv), he has not only to plead and prove the breach but also show that the result of the election, insofar as it concerned the returned candidate, has been materially affected thereby – Though there are some general references to non-compliance with particular provisions of the Act of 1951 and the rules made thereunder, there are neither adequate pleadings nor proof to substantiate and satisfy the requirements of s.100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act of 1951 – Therefore, it is clear that NT (unsuccessful candidate) tied up the improper acceptance of KK nomination, relatable to s.100(1)(d)(i) of the Act of 1951, with the non-compliance relatable to s.100(1)(d)(iv) thereof and he did not sufficiently plead or prove a specific breach or how it materially affected the result of the election, in so far as it concerned the returned candidate, KK – It was not open to NT to link up separate issues and fail to plead in detail and adduce sufficient evidence in relation to the non-compliance that would attract s.100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act of 1951 – The finding of the High Court in that regard is equally bereft of rhyme and reason and cannot be sustained.
