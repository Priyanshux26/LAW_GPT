[Paras 60, E 67][219-F; 225-F-H; 226-A-B] Rohitash Kumar & Ors. v Om Prakash Sharma & Ors (2013) 11 SCC 451 : [2012] 13 SCR 47; State of Madhya Pradesh v Rakesh Kohli [2012] 6 SCR 661; State of Gujarat v Shri Ambica Mills 1974 (3) SCR 760; F Ajoy Kumar Banerjee & Ors. v.

Union of India (2007) 6 SCC 624 : [2007] 7 SCR 310 – relied on. G 1.7 The object behind imposing the ‘pre-import condition’ is discernible from paragraph 4.03 of FTP and Annexure-4J of the HBP; that only few articles were enumerated when the FTP was published, is no ground for the exporters to complain that other articles could not be included for the purpose of ‘pre-import H UNION OF INDIA AND ORS. v. COSMO FILMS LIMITED 191 condition’; as held earlier, that is the import of paragraph 4.03 A (i). The numerous schemes in the FTP are to maintain an equilibrium between exporters’ claims, on the one hand and on the other hand, to preserve the Revenue’s interests. Here, what is involved is exemption and postponement of exemption of IGST, a new levy altogether, whose mechanism was being worked out B and evolved, for the first time. The plea of impossibility to fulfil ‘pre-import conditions’ under old AAs was made, suggesting that the notifications retrospectively mandated new conditions. The exporter respondents’ argument that there is no rationale for differential treatment of BCD and IGST under AA scheme is without merit. BCD is a customs levy at the point of import. At C that stage, there is no question of credit. On the other hand, IGST is levied at multiple points (including at the stage of import) and input credit gets into the stream, till the point of end user. As a result, there is justification for a separate treatment of the two levies. IGST is levied under the IGST Act, 2017 and is collected, D for convenience, at the customs point through the machinery under the Customs Act, 1962. The impugned notifications, therefore, cannot be faulted for arbitrariness or under classification. [Para 69][226-H; 227-A-E] 1.8 The High Court was persuaded to hold that the E subsequent notification of 10.01.2019 withdrew the ‘pre-import condition’ meant that the Union itself recognized its unworkable and unfeasible nature, and consequently the condition should not be insisted upon for the period it existed, i.e., after 13.10.2017. The reasoning is faulty. It is now settled that the FTPRA contains no power to frame retrospective regulations. To give F retrospective effect, to the notification of 10.01.2019 through interpretation, would be to achieve what is impermissible in law. Therefore, the impugned cannot be sustained on this score as well. [Paras 70, 71][227-E-F; 228-A-B] 1.9 The impugned and s of the Gujarat High G Court are set aside.
