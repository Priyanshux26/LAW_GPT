The Certifi cate also sets out the total period of custody including custody till 27.04.2023, which is the date of the Certifi cate. Since the applicant, in obedience to the of this Court dated 01.03.2019, has surrendered on 15.03.2019, I fi nd merit in this application. The applicant fi led the Special Leave Petition challenging the conviction under Section 376(2)(g) of the Indian Penal code and the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and the direction to pay a sum of Rs.20,000/- as fi ne and in default to suff er imprisonment for six months. The Special Leave Petition has been fi led on behalf of the petitioners – Sanjit Saha and Anil Saha assailing the of the 88 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. High Court dated 05.07.2018 in Criminal Appeal No.188 of 2014. Both the petitioners in the Special Leave Petition had fi led Criminal Appeal No. 188 of 2014 on the fi le of the High Court at Calcutta. The application for exemption from surrendering was also fi led on behalf of the accused Anil Saha. The of 01.03.2019 was passed on behalf of the said accused Anil Saha also. In fact the affi davits in support of the Special Leave Petition and the interim applications as well as the affi davit in support of condonation of delay in refi ling are fi led by the co-petitioner Anil Saha. It is not clear as to what is the status of surrender with regard to the said co-petitioner Anil Saha. Let a report be called for from the Additional Sessions Judge, 2nd Fast Track Court, Raiganj as to whether the said Anil Saha who was convicted by the said Sessions Judge in Sessions Case No.76/2012 (S.T. No. 52/2012) by dated 06.01.2014 (and was sentenced originally to 12 years imprisonment by the Trial Judge which was modifi ed to 10 years R.I. along with fi ne and default sentence by the High Court at Calcutta in Criminal Appeal No.188 of 2014) has surrendered to undergo his sentence. The Additional Sessions Judge, 2nd Fast Track Court, Raiganj may take the assistance of the Jail Superintendent in the District to elicit the information within two weeks. Considering that it is a matter of personal liberty and considering the fact that the accused Sanjit Saha has in fact surrendered on 15.03.2019 and is in custody, interest of justice requires that his Special Leave Petition be heard on merits. In fact the default was only in reporting compliance. The peremptory dismissal is only on account of delay in reporting compliance. The applicant cannot be prejudiced for the delay in reporting compliance which is also occasioned additionally due to the passing away of the Advocate-on-Record on 10.04.2021. Hence, the delay is condoned and the application for recall is allowed. The dated 24.02.2020 is recalled insofar as petitioner no.1 Sanjit Saha is concerned. The SLP is restored to the record as far as the petitioner no. 1-Sanjit Saha is concerned. SANJIT SAHA & ANR.
