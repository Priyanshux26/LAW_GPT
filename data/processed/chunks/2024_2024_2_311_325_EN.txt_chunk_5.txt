Accordingly, in furtherance of the protection granted by the Apex Court to the petitioners by the dated 4th July, 2023, while disposing of the Contempt Petition (Civil) No. 774 of 2023, it is provided that further proceedings, including summoning of the officers, consequent to the F.I.R. No. 197 of 2023 dated 15.4.2023 under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B - IPC, Police Station Beta-2, Greater Noida, Gautam Budh Nagar, registered by Respondent No.2 and consequent ECIR No. ECIR/HIU-I/06/2023 registered by Respondent No. 4, shall remain stayed so far as it confines to the petitioners only and no coercive action shall be taken against them.” 16. The High Court passed the other impugned s on 08.08.2023 in Criminal Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.11837/2023 and on 13.09.2023 in Criminal Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.14053/2023, following the dated 13.07.2023 passed in Writ Petition No.10893/2023. Consequently, the proceedings of the FIR No.197/2023, FIR No.611/23 as also the ECIR No. ECIR/HIU-I/06/2023 have been stayed qua the concerned respondents herein pending the said three writ petitions before the High Court, and the concerned respondents [2024] 2 S.C.R. 319 Directorate of Enforcement v. Niraj Tyagi & Ors. who are the accused in the said FIRs have been protected from any coercive action being taken against them. The present appeals stem out of the aforesaid impugned s passed by the High Court. 17. The ASG, Mr. Raju appearing for the appellant ED in all the three appeals vehemently submitted that this Court had passed the dated 04.07.2023 in Gagan Banga’s case staying the proceedings of ECIR and the FIRs registered against the concerned respondents without hearing the ED, and therefore the ED has filed a Review Petition, which is pending before this Court. He further submitted that the High Court also without assigning any cogent reasons in the impugned s stayed the said proceedings of ECIR and FIRs under the guise of following the said dated 04.07.2023 passed by this Court. Placing heavy reliance on the decision of the Three- Judge Bench in Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra and Others1, he submitted that this Court has strongly deprecated the practice of the courts granting interim s staying the investigation or directing the investigating agencies not to take coercive actions against the accused. The impugned s passed by the High Court therefore being in the teeth of the said settled legal position, the same deserve to be quashed and set aside forthwith. 18. However, the learned Senior counsels appearing for the respondents in the respective appeals, taking the Court to the proceedings which had taken place under the SARFAESI Act and before the High Court and this Court, submitted that the respondent-complainant Shipra Group having failed in all the said proceedings had taken recourse to the criminal proceedings to create a fear amongst the financial institution and its officers. They further submitted that the High Court taking into consideration the passed by this Court in Gagan Banga’s case had rightly protected the financial institution and its officers who had discharged their duties for the recovery of the dues from the borrowers.
