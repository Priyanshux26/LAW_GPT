The summary of how each of the counterclaims were dealt with, is found in paragraph 17 of the Award. 118 See paragraphs 13.13 (c) and 13.15 of the Award, extracted in 88 (10) and 88 (19) above. 119 Paragraph 14 of the Award. [2024] 9 S.C.R. 595 OPG Power Generation Private Limited v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions India Private Limited & Anr. 126. We have, therefore, to consider whether the two counterclaims (d) and (e) were justifiably held time-barred or not. More particularly, because claimant’s claim which arose out of same contract was found within limitation. 127. Since counterclaim is to be treated as a separate suit or a cross-suit, its limitation would have to be determined independent of the claim, based on the cause of action espoused therein. Therefore, we would have to determine as to when the right to seek for the counterclaims (d) and (e) accrued. In this context, while dealing with the previous issue i.e., regarding the claim being within limitation, we noticed a few dates which, in our view, would be helpful in determining the present issue. These dates are: (a) May 2015 - when ACC Unit got commissioned and was operating satisfactorily, as per certificate dated 2 March 2017 issued by OPG. (b) 21 September 2015 – deemed date of takeover of the project i.e., when all alleged defects were removed by the claimant, and a request was made by the claimant to the purchaser (appellant(s) herein) to undertake performance guarantee test. (c) 19 March 2016 – when the period of 180 days of guaranteed performance expired. This date is important because, as per the contract, if, within the aforesaid period, the performance guarantee test is not undertaken, despite request of the supplier, it is to be deemed that the supplier has discharged its liability of a guaranteed performance of 180 days. 128. The Tribunal takes 21 September 2015 as the start point of limitation for the counterclaim on the premise that it would be the date when the Takeover Certificate is deemed to have been issued. That is, the supplier had fulfilled its obligations. On basis thereof, the Tribunal found counterclaims (d) and (e) barred by time as the counterclaim was filed on 15 July 2019 i.e., more than three years later, and there existed no acknowledgement in respect thereof. 129. However, while dealing with the previous issue, we found 19 March 2016 as the start point of limitation for the claim because that is the date when 180 days period of guaranteed performance, which was part of supplier’s liability, expired. Be that as it may, whether we count the limitation period from 21 September 2015 or 19 March 596 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 2016, the counterclaim which was filed on 15 July 2019 was beyond the prescribed period of three years inasmuch as its cause of action could not have arisen after 19 March 2016 because by 19 March 2016, the supplier / contractor had fulfilled its obligation of guaranteed performance for 180 days.
