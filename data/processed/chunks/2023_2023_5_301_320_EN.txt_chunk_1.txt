[Para 49][319-B-C] 1.5 A post-mortem or autopsy is not carried out by/in the presence of Ayurved doctors. Section 174 of the Code of Criminal E Procedure, 19738 deals with the procedure for the police to inquire and report on suicide, etc. Sub-section (3) of Section 174 mandates that the police officer shall, subject to such rules as the State Government may prescribe, forward the dead body, with a view to its being examined, to the nearest Civil Surgeon, or other qualified medical man appointed in this behalf by the State F Government, in certain types of cases such as, (i) suicide by a woman within seven years of marriage; (ii) death of a woman within seven years of marriage in certain circumstances; and (iii) cases where there are any doubts regarding the cause of death. Section 176 of Cr.P.C deals with inquiry by Magistrates into cause of G death. Sub-section (5) of Section 176 uses similar words namely “Civil Surgeon or other qualified medical man”. The AYUSH doctors are normally not notified as competent to perform post- mortem. [Paras 50, 51][319-C-F] 1.6 It is common knowledge that during out-patient days (OPD) in general hospitals in cities/towns, MBBS doctors are H STATE OF GUJARAT & ORS. ETC. v. DR. P. A. BHATT & ORS. 303 ETC. made to attend to hundreds of patients, which is not the case A with Ayurveda doctors. In the comparative chart extracted, the State of Gujarat have claimed that IV injections and ART injections cannot be administered by Ayurved doctors. [Paras 52-53][319- F-H] 1.7 Even while recognizing the importance of Ayurved B doctors and the need to promote alternative/indigenous systems of medicine, this Court cannot be oblivious of the fact that both categories of doctors are certainly not performing equal work to be entitled to equal pay. Hence, issue No.2 is answered in favour of the appellant-State and against the respondents. [Para 54][320- C A-B] 1.8 The impugned of the High Court is liable to be set aside. As a sequitur, the benefits derived by the respondents by virtue of the interim passed by this Court on 08.09.2014, are liable to be recovered from the respondents. In the normal course, this Court would not have desired to allow the State to D effect recovery but for the fact that a few doctors have received and a few have not. Among the Ayurved doctors, a classification cannot be amde between those who have already received some benefits by virtue of the interim of this Court dated 08.09.2014 and those who have not received such benefits. E Moreover, the fundamental principle cannot be overlooked that a benefit derived by an individual by virtue of an interim passed by a Court cannot be allowed to be retained, if the ultimate outcome of the case went against such a person.
