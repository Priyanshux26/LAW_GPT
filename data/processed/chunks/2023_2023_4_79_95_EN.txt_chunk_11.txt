34. That apart, the question of locus was never raised by the G appellants before the High Court and once the subject issue has been looked into by the High Court on merits and we too are persuaded that of the AAIFR confirming the bid pursuant to its impugned dated 1st April, 2005 is not legally sustainable, we do not find any justification at this stage to non-suit the claim of the appellants prayed for in Civil Appeal No.10127 of 2011. H 94 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A 35. Further submissions made by the learned counsel that the conditions of the ASC were scrupulously adhered to and the entire bid amount was deposited after the came to be passed by the AAIFR confirming the bid on 3rd June, 2005 and 7th June, 2005 and Tripartite MOU was executed is of no substance for the reason that the very procedure in the first instance initiated by the Operating Agency was B defective at its very inception and before initiation of theauction proceedings, neither the value of the property was assessed through the approved valuer nor the reserve price was notified in the auction notice dated 24th May, 2004 and the solitary bid of the appellant for Rs.2,84,00,000/- was accepted and confirmed by the AAIFR without C taking note of the fact that the appellant has failed to comply with the guidelines laid down by the ASC indicating that successful purchaser has to furnish a bank guarantee valid for a period of one year within 15 days of intimation regarding acceptance of the bid and the balance of the purchase consideration has to be paid in two instalments of 50% and 48% of the total selling price payable respectively before the end of 45 D days and 90 days from the date of intimation of final acceptance of the bid is dispatched at his notified address which is the requirement in terms of clause (h) and (i) of the procedure and guidelines laid down by the ASC and that being a part of the auction notice, the appellant was under obligation to comply with and despite opportunity the appellant has failed E to comply with both the twin conditions and, thus in the facts and circumstance, the Division Bench of the High Court has rightly set aside the of AAIFR dated 1st April, 2005. 36. So far as the submission made by learned counsel for the appellants in Civil Appeal No. 10127 of 2011 that the offer made by the F appellants was higher than the sealed bid is concerned, it has no substance for the reason that the appellants have not participated in the bidding process and it is not the case of the appellants that the auction notice published on 24th May, 2004 was not in their knowledge. In our considered view, later offer in the facts and circumstances of the case tendered by the appellants was of no legal significance and rightly not acknowledged G by the authority.
