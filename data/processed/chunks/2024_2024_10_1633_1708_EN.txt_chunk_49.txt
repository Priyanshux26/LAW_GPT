v. Rajeev Bansal 87. The directions issued by this Court under Article 142 cannot be considered as a ratio because they are issued based on the peculiar facts and circumstances of the cause or matter before this Court.143 In State v. Kalyan Singh,144 this Court observed that a has two components: (a) declaration of law; and (b) directions. In Bir Singh v. Mukesh Kumar,145 it was held that what is binding on all courts under Article 141146 is the declaration of law, and not the directions issued under Article 142.147 88. This Court has exercised its jurisdiction under Article 142 in tax matters where the actions of the Revenue are not in accordance with the law.148 In Whirlpool of India Ltd. v. CIT,149 this Court directed the Income Tax Officer to give effect to the of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal by disallowing a particular deduction. In CIT v. Greenworld Corporation,150 the issue before this Court was whether a Commissioner of Income Tax151 appropriately issued directions under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act to an assessing officer to reopen assessments. It was held that the facts of the case did not merit the CIT to issue directions to the assessing officer. Consequently, this Court termed the reassessment notice issued by the assessing officer to be illegal and exercised its jurisdiction 143 J & K Public Service Commission v. Narinder Mohan (1994) 2 SCC 630 [11]. 144 (2017) 7 SCC 444. [22. […] It is important to notice that Article 142 follows upon Article 141 of the Constitution, in which it is stated that the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India. Thus, every delivered by the Supreme Court has two components — the law declared which binds courts in future litigation between persons, and the doing of complete justice in any cause or matter which is pending before it.] 145 (2019) 4 SCC 197 [30] 146 Article 141, Constitution of India. [It reads: “141. Law declared by Supreme Court to be binding on all courts – The law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India.”] 147 Also see State of Punjab v. Rafiq Masih (2014) 8 SCC 883 [12]. [12. […] The Court has compartmentalized and differentiated the relief in the operative portion of the by exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution as against the law declared. The directions of the Court under Article 142 of the Constitution, while moulding the relief, that relax the application of law or exempt the case in hand from the rigour of the law in view of the peculiar facts and circumstances do not comprise the ratio decidendi and therefore lose its basic premise of making it a binding precedent. This Court in the qui vive has expanded the horizons of Article 142 of the Constitution by keeping it outside the purview of Article 141 of the Constitution and declaring it a direction of the Court that changes its complexion with the peculiarity in the facts and circumstances of the case.”] 148 See Prashanti Medical Services & Research Foundation v.
