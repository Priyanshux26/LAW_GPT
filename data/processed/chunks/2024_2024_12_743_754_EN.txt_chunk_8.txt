This was duly taken note of by the Courts. In view of the said decision and what is stated sin Taylor’s Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence, 13th Edn., Pp 307-08, which were extracted in paragraph 14 of the impugned and in view of the position obtained from the evidence of PW-8, we do not find any reason to proceed further with the said contention that owing to the non-rupture of hyoid bone the finding of homicidal death invites interference. 18. Now, we will consider whether the appellant who was bound to offer his version as to how the occurrence had taken place in the circumstances obtained in this case, had discharged his onus by virtue of Section 106 of the Evidence Act. Section 106 is an exception to the general rule laid down in Section 101, that the burden of proving a fact rest on the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of the issues and that this Section is not intended to relieve any person of that duty or burden. 19. If some occurrence happened inside a residence where the accused is supposed to be, he is bound to offer his version as to how the occurrence had taken place. In the case on hand, the prosecution had succeeded in establishing, rather it is an attempt and undisputed fact that the deceased and the appellant-convict were residing in the place of occurrence, which is the house of the accused. On the death 5 2017 INSC 479 : [2017] 4 SCR 298 : (2017) 8 SCC 497 754 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of the wife, the appellant alone could offer an explanation, though this Section could not be used so as to shift the onus of proving the offence from the prosecution to the accused. In the absence of explanation when other circumstances fasten the culpability on the appellant’s failure to offer satisfactory explanation as to the occurrence, the only possible inference could be that the accused had participated in the crime. (See the decisions in Dnyaneshwar v. State of Maharashtra,6 and Raj Kumar Prasad Tamarkar v. State of Bihar and Anr.7). 20. As established by the prosecution, the place of occurrence is the matrimonial home of the deceased where the deceased and appellant were living. The evidence of PW-8, Aarti that the deceased was being tortured, physically and mentally was also not controverted while being cross-examined, as held by the two Courts. The Courts have taken note of the fact that though PW-8 gave evidence to such effect while being examined in chief, there was no cross-examination on such points to make her untrustworthy. 21. The cumulative effect and impact of all such circumstances explained together with the sturdy reasons assigned by the trial Court which got confirmation from the impugned , constrain us to hold that this appeal is devoid of merits. Consequently, the captioned appeal stands dismissed. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan 6 2007 INSC 323 : [2007] 4 SCR 248 : (2007) 10 SCC 445 7 2007 INSC 3 : [2007] 1 SCR 13 : (2007) 10 SCC 433
