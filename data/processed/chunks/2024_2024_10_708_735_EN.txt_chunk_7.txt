The High Court found that the defendants had never challenged the Ex- P- 1C sale deed dated 04.06.1968. Consequently, it was found that possession was transferred to the plaintiff in 1968 pursuant to the sale deed and Ex-P-2 and P-3, Khasra entries for the period of year 1971-1972 to 1977 and 1978 would further reveal the ownership and possession of the plaintiff over the suit schedule property. It was further found that though the defendants had contended that there occurred an oral partition of the properties in the year 1976 between the family of the plaintiff and the defendants whereunder, the defendants received the suit schedule property and shop at Raipur and the plaintiff received shop at Dhamtari and land in Khasra No. 924, the First Appellate Court held that the said oral partition was not proved by the defendants/the appellants herein and the said finding of the First Appellate Court had become final. The High Court had also taken note of the fact that earlier the defendants filed Ex- P-4 application dated 27.01.1981 (produced as Annexure P-13 in these proceedings) before Tahsildar, Raipur stating that they had been or they had cultivated the suit land for two years i.e. 1973 and 1974 as Adhiyadar (lessee) and thereby acquired the rights of occupancy tenants and their names be recorded in revenue records. It was found that in the said application they had again admitted the ownership of plaintiff over the suit schedule property. Ex- P-4 application was rejected by the Tahsildar as per dated 22.06.1985 and the same was upheld by the Sub-Divisional Officer and later by the Commissioner as per s dated 29.10.1986 and 29.03.1988 respectively. The High Court also found that the contents of Ex-P-4 application dated 27.01.1981 filed before Tahsildar, Raipur [2024] 10 S.C.R. 719 Neelam Gupta & Ors. v. Rajendra Kumar Gupta & Anr. was admitted by defendant No. 1 while being cross-examined ultimately to arrive at the conclusion that such permissive possession could not be converted as adverse possession except by proving their possession adverse to the title of the plaintiff for a continuous period of 12 years or more. Obviously, the High Court found that the contentions raised to claim the occupancy tenancy before the Tahsildar and the contentions qua adverse possession before the Civil Court are contradictory in nature. The High Court relied on the decision of this court in Indira v. Arumugam and Anr.1 to hold that when the suit is one for possession based on title and when once title is established on the basis of relevant documents and other evidence brought on record in such suit unless the defendant could prove adverse possession for the prescriptive period, the suit of the plaintiff could not be dismissed. Relying on the decision of this court in Saroop Singh v. Banto and Ors.,2 the High Court held that in the light of Article 65 of the Limitation Act, the starting point of limitation would not commence from the date when the right of ownership arises to the plaintiff but would commence from the date the defendant’s possession became adverse.
