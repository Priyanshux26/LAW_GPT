Being aggrieved by the dated 18.11.2022 passed in Matters under Article 227 No.8207 of 2017, the appellant/landlord is before this Court. By the impugned , the High Court stated that since there is a matter under Article 227 No.5718 of 2019, which has to be answered by a larger Bench of the High Court by way of a reference and which has a bearing on the case, the interim is continued until further s. A direction was issued that the matter may be considered after the answer is given by the larger Bench, referred to above. Being aggrieved by the said , the appellant, who is the landlord, has preferred this appeal. 3. We have heard learned counsel for the respective parties and perused the material on record. 4. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that it is not known as to when the larger Bench would answer the questions referred to it on a reference. However, having regard to Article 254 of the Constitution of India, particularly the proviso to Sub-clause 2 of Article 254, the amendment made by the Parliament by Section 2 of Act 3 of 2003, whereby Section 106 of the Transfer of Property [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1495 Naeem Bano Alias Gaindo v. Mohammad Rahees & Anr. Act, 1882 (for short, “the T.P. Act”) has been substituted with effect from 31.12.2002, would apply and the provision of the Uttar Pradesh Amendment would no longer be applicable to the present case. It was submitted that the notice for ejectment was issued on 24.07.2015 under Section 106 of the T.P. Act. The said notice was issued having regard to the Parliamentary amendment referred to above and hence the earlier amendment made to Section 106 by the Uttar Pradesh State Legislature vide 30.11.1954 would pale into insignificance on the principle of implied repeal.
