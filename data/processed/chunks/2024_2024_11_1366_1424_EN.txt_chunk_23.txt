Reference was also made to All India Manufacturers Organisation and Others (supra) which also elucidates the question of bona fides. It is observed that the petitioner therein who had filed the first litigation had special technical expertise on the matter to impute the project on the ground that he did. Further, the first had references to the issue of plan, types of plan required, etc. Lastly, the claims and the arguments raised in the second petition were largely and substantially same in the first petition. After referring to the first , it is observed: “35. As a matter of fact, in a public interest litigation, the petitioner is not agitating his individual rights but represents the public at large. As long as the litigation is bona fide, a in a previous public interest litigation would be a in rem. It binds the public at large and bars any member of the public from coming forward before the court and raising any connected issue or an issue, which had been raised should have been raised on an earlier occasion by way of a public interest litigation. It 23 [2021] 10 SCR 954 : (2022) 4 SCC 764 24 [1990] 3 SCR 72 : 1989 Supp (1) 504 1400 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports cannot be doubted that the petitioner in Somashekar Reddy was acting bona fide. Further, we may note that, as a retired Chief Engineer, Somashekar Reddy had the special technical expertise to impugn the Project on the grounds that he did and so, he cannot be dismissed as a busybody. Thus, we are satisfied in principle that Somashekar Reddy, as a public interest litigation, could bar the present litigation.” 35. The main argument raised on behalf of the Cooperative Societies and its members is that the principle of res judicata and constructive res judicata would apply in the present case. We are of the opinion that the question of res judicata will certainly not apply, as the previous did not, as accepted by everyone, examine the constitutional validity of GoM Nos. 243 and 244. GoM Nos. 420, 422 to 425 dated 25.03.2008 had not been issued at the time the said was pronounced and hence, could never have been challenged. On the question of constructive res judicata, we must accept that the same will have limited application to public interest litigation. 36. The contention is that Writ Petition No. 13730 of 2006 was filed in public interest by Mr. V.S. Bose, Dr. Rao V.B.J. Chelikani and Mr. O.M. Debara, which petition was disposed of vide dated 08.10.2007. The , as noticed above, specifically records that the petitioners therein had not challenged GoM Nos. 243 and 244 dated 28.02.2005. However, this had in fact quashed the allotment made in terms of GoM No. 522 dated 04.05.2006, insofar as the GoM had permitted allotment of land to individuals, who are not members of Cooperative Societies and groups, or who may have received benefit of concessional allotment, either in individual capacity or as a member of a Cooperative Society or group to which preferential allotment had been made.
