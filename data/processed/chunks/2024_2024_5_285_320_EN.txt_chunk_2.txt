Thereafter, it is seen that the Complainant/ Insured further underwent a merger/amalgamation and was finally merged/amalgamated with ‘Tata Steel Ltd’ w.e.f. 11.11.2021. In view of the said facts, all the applications for change of name are allowed. 3. These are four Civil Appeals arising out of the proceedings in Original Petition No. 233 of 2000 before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi [“NCDRC”]. 4. Civil Appeal No. 2759 of 2009 has been filed by the New India Assurance Company Limited [hereinafter referred to as “NIACL” or the “Insurer” or the “Insurance Company”] challenging the dated 05.08.2008 of the NCDRC. By the said , the NCDRC partly allowed the complaint of the Insured. The NCDRC awarded an amount of Rs.13,15,27,000/- with interest at 10% per annum from the expiry of two months since the submission of survey report dated [2024] 5 S.C.R. 289 New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v. M/s Tata Steel Ltd. 11.12.2001, payable to the Insured. The amount already paid by the Insurance Company was ed to be adjusted and a cost of Rs. 50,000/- was also awarded to the Insured. NIACL, in this Appeal, is aggrieved with the finding that the Complainant’s claim must be settled, based on calculating depreciation at the rate of 32% - and not 60%. 5. The Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(Civil) No. 10001 of 2009 has been filed by the Insured/Complainant. The grievance here is against the dismissal of Misc. Application No. 298 of 2008 in Original Petition No. 233 of 2000 seeking review of the dated 05.08.2008. 6. Civil Appeal Nos. 5242-5243 of 2009 have been filed by the Insured/ Complainant against the main dated 05.08.2008 (passed in O.P. No. 233 of 2000) and dated 29.08.2008 (allowing the application for rectification and correcting the figure awarded to Rs. 13,51,27,000/- instead of Rs. 13,15,27,000/-) respectively. 7. The grievance pleaded by the Insured/Complainant in its connected appeals is that the compensation awarded ought to have been greater because, according to it, the base figure on which the depreciation of 32% was computed should have been Rs.28 Crores and not Rs.20,09,95,000/-. The claim was that, so computing, the amount payable by NIACL should have been Rs. 18.91 Crores. Brief Summary of Facts: 8. The Insured had taken an insurance policy from NIACL for the entire machinery and equipment of its mill by paying a premium of Rs.62,09,655/-. The policy was for the period 29.09.1998 to 28.09.1999. According to the Insured, due to a fire accident on 12.12.1998, the ‘20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill’ fitted with imported equipment was fully destroyed resulting in a loss of Rs. 35.08 crores. The incident of fire was intimated to NIACL on 12.12.1998 itself. Surveyors ‘M/s R.K. Singhal and Company Pvt. Ltd.’ and subsequently ‘M/s A.K. Govil and Associates’ and ‘M/s P.C. Gandhi’ were appointed by NIACL. A claim for Rs. 35.08 crores was filed on 29.01.1999. According to the Insured, this was based upon the quotations received from various manufacturers of the said machinery and the complete details of cost for replacing and/or repairing the machines.
