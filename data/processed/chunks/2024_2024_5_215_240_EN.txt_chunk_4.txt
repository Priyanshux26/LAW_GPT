He relied upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of Tuticorin Alkali Chemicals & Fertilisers Ltd., Madras v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras3 and Consolidated Construction Consortium Limited v. Hitro Energy Solutions Private Limited4. He submitted that booking or payment of interest is not the only criterion for ascertaining whether the debt is a financial debt. The learned senior counsel, therefore, urged that the view taken by the NCLAT in the impugned is entirely fallacious. He submitted that the NCLAT has virtually rewritten the concepts of financial and operational debts incorporated in the IBC. 6. On facts, the learned senior counsel submitted that the payment of the security deposit by the first respondent is a condition precedent 1 [2019] 3 SCR 535 : (2019) 4 SCC 17 2 [2019] 10 SCR 381 : (2019) 8 SCC 416 3 [1997] Supp. 1 SCR 528 : (1997) 6 SCC 117 4 [2022] 2 SCR 212 : (2022) 7 SCC 164 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 221 Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr. v. Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. & Anr for being appointed as a Sales Promoter of the corporate debtor. The intent of the agreements is to appoint the first respondent as the Sales Promoter and not to avail any financial facilities from the first respondent. The amount paid by the first respondent does not constitute financial facilities extended to the corporate debtor. There was no intention to raise finance from the first respondent, who was appointed as a Sales Promoter. The learned senior counsel also relied upon the decisions of this court in the cases of Anuj Jain, Interim Resolution Professional for Jaypee Infratech Limited v. Axis Bank Limited & Ors.5, Phoenix ARC Private Limited v. Spade Financial Services Limited & Ors.6 and New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. Anand Sonbhadra7. Lastly, it is submitted that in the case of an invoice involving any transaction, the delay in payment attracts interest liability. Therefore, the payment of interest is not the sole criterion for ascertaining whether a debt is a financial debt. He would, thus, submit that the appeals deserve to be allowed. 7. The learned senior counsel appearing for the first respondent submitted that the true nature of the agreements will have to be examined for deciding the nature of the debt. He pointed out several factual aspects, including the corporate debtor’s acknowledgement of the liability of payment of interest on security deposit for the Financial Years 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. The corporate debtor deducted TDS on the interest payable to the first respondent for three financial years. He submitted that the three criteria, namely, disbursal, time value of money and commercial effect of borrowing, are satisfied in the case of the present transaction. He also relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of Anuj Jain, Interim Resolution Professional for Jaypee Infratech Limited5. He submitted that it was very clear from the terms of the agreement that the money was repayable after a fixed tenure without a deduction or provision for forfeiture.
