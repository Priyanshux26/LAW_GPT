R.L is returned herewith]” 10. Importantly, the respondent secured employment with the FCI on 14.04.1997 and although his Writ Petition was filed six months after securing the new job, the employment with the FCI was concealed in the Writ Petition. If this vital aspect was known the High Court 2374 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports possibly would have taken a different view and the respondent abandoning his job with the LIC, could have been easily inferred. 11. Relief was granted to the respondent by the High Court on the ground that the termination was passed without affording a reasonable opportunity or conducting an inquiry into the charge of absence from duty. But in granting such relief, the Court overlooked that it was a case of the respondent abandoning his services without informing his employer about his whereabouts. Subsequently, it came to light that he joined the FCI on 09.05.1997. 12. Such conduct of the respondent could not have been condoned by the employer and therefore, in our assessment, treating the respondent to have abandoned his service and taking appropriate action against him, in terms of the LIC Staff Regulation, cannot be faulted. It is also necessary for us to say that as the delinquent was guilty of suppression of the fact of his employment with the FCI, he was disentitled to equitable relief from the High Court in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution. 13. With the above conclusion, the High Court in our assessment, erred in granting relief to the respondent by allowing the Writ Petition. The impugned is accordingly set aside and quashed. With this, the appeal stands allowed leaving the parties to bear their own cost. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankitesh Ojha, Hony.
