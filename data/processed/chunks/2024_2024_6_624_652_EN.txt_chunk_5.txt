& Ors.5, it is argued that the principles enshrined in Section 144 CPC have to be given the widest possible meaning, therefore, even in case of variation or modification of decree, restitution must follow. Reference is also made to Chinnamal (supra). 5. Learned senior counsel for the appellant would highlight that the decree holder in the present case enjoyed harvesting 24 acres of land for over 25 years and then sold the said land for a sum of Rs. 39 lakhs on 17.07.2009 to respondent no. 3 who was gambling on the litigation. He had full knowledge of the litigation which is reflected from the recital in the sale deed (in para 4 of the sale deed) wherein he agreed that if the decree holder loses the litigation, Rs. 39 lakhs would be paid back to him (to the purchaser) without interest. This crucial point was not noticed by the courts below as probably, the said information was not made available to the court. Such subsequent purchaser can never be treated as bona fide purchaser as held in the matter of Chinnamal (supra), Gurjoginder Singh vs. Jaswant Kaur & Anr.6 & Padanathil (supra). 6. Per contra, Mr. Vinay Navare learned senior counsel appearing for respondent nos. 1 and 2 would submit that even assuming that the modified decree was for Rs. 17120/-, auction sale by the Executing 2 [1966] 3 SCR 24 : AIR 1966 SC 948 3 [1990] 1 SCR 78 : AIR 1990 SC 1828 4 [1996] 1 SCR 651 : (1996) 7 SCC 668 5 [2003] Supp. 4 SCR 651 : (2003) 8 SCC 648 6 [1994] 1 SCR 794 : (1994) 2 SCC 368 632 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Court was inevitable and the appellant cannot claim for setting aside the sale and his only right is to recover the amount of difference i.e. Rs. 10574/- under Section 144 CPC. It is argued that the appellant/ defendant remained absent during the proceedings, and he entered into two agreements to defraud the respondent/plaintiff which has been noted by the Executing Court while rejecting his objections to the attachment and sale of the said property. Insofar as the valuation of the property mentioned in the attachment Panchanama under Rule 54 of XXI it is argued that the rule itself does not contemplate valuation at the time of attachment. It is then argued that the contention regarding hurried auction cannot be raised in the proceedings under Section 144 CPC for which there are various provisions in XXI CPC which can be invoked in the course of the execution proceedings. The appellant having not invoked any such provisions, the same cannot be raised in proceeding under Section 144 CPC. It is also submitted that XXI is a self-contained code and Principal of Estoppel would apply because the appellant, having accepted the conclusion of auction proceedings and choosing not to challenge the same, is now estopped from questioning the validity of the auction. 7. Learned counsel would further submit that the s referred by the appellant in the matter of South Eastern Coal Field (supra) has no application in the facts of the present case.
