After taking us through the mandate of Article 239AA, in particular, sub-Article (4), read in conjunction with Section 41 of the Government of National Capital Territory Act of 1991,6 he submitted that these provisions mirror Article 163 of the Constitution, requiring the Governor to act only on the aid and advice of the popularly elected Government. For this purpose, the principles laid down in Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab7 and Nabam Rebia and Bamang Felix v. Deputy Speaker, Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly8 were relied on to put forth the point that the satisfaction of the Lt. Governor in the cabinet system of Government is the satisfaction of his Council of Ministers. 5.1 Referring to Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the DMC Act, it is also argued that the provision cannot be construed as expressly vesting any discretion in the Lt. Governor to nominate persons to the Corporation. He further submitted that the issue, if any, is conclusively decided by the Constitution Bench decisions of this Court in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Union of India,9 and the recent pronouncement in the case of Government of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India.10 6 Hereinafter referred to as GNCTD Act. 7 [1975] 1 SCR 814 : (1974) 2 SCC 831 8 [2016] 6 SCR 1 : (2016) 8 SCC 1 9 (2018) 8 SCC 501 10 [2023] 9 SCR 493 : (2023) 9 SCC 1 212 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 6. Shri Sanjay Jain, Learned Additional Solicitor General, representing the Lt. Governor has not joined issue on the interpretation of Article 239AA, or on the ratio in Samsher Singh (supra) and the two Constitution Bench s of this Court on Article 239AA. It is his submission that the relevant provision of the DMC Act must be read in consonance with Part IXA of the Constitution relating to grant of Constitutional Status to ‘Municipalities’. 6.1 Mr. Jain has taken us through certain provisions of the GNCTD Act, as well as the DMC Act to demonstrate the distribution of powers and duties among various authorities. Interpreted in this context, he submitted it will be evident that the Lt. Governor is specifically empowered under Section 3(3)(b)(i) to nominate persons of his own accord and that obligation does not fall within the duty to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. 7. In rejoinder, Dr. Singhvi submitted that there is a long-standing practice of over 30 years of the Administrator/Lt. Governor nominating councillors only on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers and that there is no justification for deviating from the established past practice. Legislative history of election and nomination of Aldermen11: 8. Municipal administration in Delhi is governed by and under the DMC Act enacted by the Parliament in 1957. Interestingly, there was no provision for appointment or nomination of Aldermen in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Bill12 as it was originally introduced in the Parliament by Shri Govind Ballabh Pant on 2nd September, 11 DMC Act initially used the expression ‘Aldermen’ to represent persons other than councillors who were represented in the Corporation.
