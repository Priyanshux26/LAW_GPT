2417 of 2010 decided on 15.06.2023 and (iii) Station House Offi cer,CBI/ACB/Bangalore v. B.A. Srinivasanand Another, reported in (2020) 2 SCC 153. 24. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant prayed that continuation of the criminal prosecution for the off ences under the IPC would be nothing but a gross abuse of the process of law and would lead to serious miscarriage of justice. He prayed that the impugned passed by the High Court be set aside and the appellant may be discharged from the criminal prosecution. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE CBI (RESPONDENT NO. 2) 25. Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, the learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG) appearing for the CBI submitted that although the sanctioning authority declined to accord sanction under Section 19 of the PC Act, 1988 to prosecute the appellant for the off ences punishable under the provisions of A. SREENIVASA REDDY v. RAKESH SHARMA AND ANR. 941 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] the PC Act, 1988 yet, that by itself is not suffi cient to discharge the appellant even from the off ences punishable under the IPC. 26. The learned ASG further submitted that the sanction required under Section 197 of the CrPC and the sanction required under the PC Act, 1988 stand on diff erent footings whereas, sanction under the IPC in terms of the CrPC is required to be granted by the State or Central Government as the case may be; under the PC Act, 1988, it can be granted also by the authorities specifi ed in Section 19 thereof. 27. She submitted that the CBI at no point of time had prayed for sanction under Section 197 of the CrPC to prosecute the appellant for the off ence under the IPC. All that was prayed for, was for sanction under Section 19 of the PC Act, 1988, which once was declined and thereafter, was accorded but ultimately the issue in regard to sanction under Section 19 of the PC Act, 1988 came to be set at rest by the High Court. According to Ms. Bhati, the entire submission canvassed on behalf of the appellant that the sanction under Section 197 of the CrPC was also prayed for and was declined, proceeds on an erroneous impression or footing. 28. In this regard, Ms. Bhati placed on record the letter dated 21.12.2014 addressed by the CBI to the Chief Vigilance Offi cer, State Bank of India, requesting for sanction under Section 19 of the PC Act, 1988. The letter referred to above reads thus: “To The Chief Vigilance Offi cer State Bank of India Vigilance Department, Corporate Centre, P.B.No.12, Mumbai-400 021.
