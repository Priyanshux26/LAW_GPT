[Paras 31, 32, 35, 36 and 38] Consumer Protection Act, 2019 – s.69 – Limitation – ‘Cause of action’: Held: ‘Cause of action’ being the foundation of the claim refers to the entire set or bundle of facts necessary and material to prove in to get a – It refers to a defi nite point of time when the requisite ingredients constituting that ‘cause of action’ are complete – The ‘cause of action’ is complete when they provide the aggrieved party with the right to invoke jurisdiction of the court/forum – The test is to determine when the aggrieved person could have fi rst maintained action for a successful result – In the present case, communication/letter dtd. 27.04.2017 by the appellant was not the starting point of the ‘cause of action’ – It was an assertion, albeit without any specifi c details or particulars – The ‘cause of action’ arose when the appellant insisted and compelled the respondents/allottees to make payment, but did not furnish the details and particulars to enable the respondents/allottees to ascertain the actual allocated sale area – In the context of the present case, it is an accepted position that the sale deeds were executed with the respondents between the period from 13.04.2018 to as late as 09.01.2020 – Thus, the complaints fi led by the respondents cannot be dismissed on the ground of being barred by limitation u/s.69. [Para 14] 1120 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. Doctrine of merger – Logic behind: Held: The logic behind the doctrine of merger is that there cannot be more than one decree or operative s governing the same subject matter at a given point of time – When a decree or passed by an inferior court, tribunal or authority is subjected to a remedy available under law before a superior forum, then the decree or under challenge continues to be eff ective and binding; nevertheless, its fi nality is put in jeopardy – Once the superior court disposes the dispute before it in any manner, either by affi rming the decree or , by setting aside or modifying the same, it is the decree of the superior court, tribunal or authority, which is the fi nal binding and operative decree – The decree and of the inferior court, tribunal or authority gets merged into the passed by the superior forum – However, this doctrine is not of universal or unlimited application – The nature of jurisdiction exercised by the superior court and the content or subject matter of challenge laid or could have been laid will have to be kept in view – Constitution of India – Article 136. [Para 32] Consumer Protection – Acquiescence – Estoppel – Subsequent purchaser – Plea raised by the appellant on acquiescence and estoppel, as the respondents-allottees/subsequent buyers are seeking a refund of the amount paid without any demur or protest about four years after the payments were made – It was also argued that it is not even the case of the respondents that original allottees had made payments under some threat, coercion or duress: Held: As held in Laureate Buildwell Private Limited v. Charanjeet Singh the nature and extent of relief, to which the subsequent purchaser can be entitled is fact and situation dependent – It cannot be argued that a subsequent purchaser, who steps into the shoes of the original allottee of a housing project in which the builder has not honoured its commitment to deliver the fl at within the stipulated time, should not expect even reasonable time for the performance of builder’s obligation – Such an argument, if accepted, would lead to a situation where a large number, possibly thousands of fl at buyers, waiting for their promised fl ats or residences would be left without any relief – Such a conclusion would be arbitrary – In these cases, it would be fair to assume that the subsequent purchaser had knowledge of the delay, but such knowledge cannot be extended to accept the submission EXPERION DEVELOPERS PVT.
