The position is well settled that when the of the fi nal court of fact is based on misinterpretation of documentary evidence or on consideration of inadmissible evidence or ignoring material evidence the High Court in second appeal is entitled to interfere with the . The position is also well settled that admission of parties or their witnesses are relevant pieces of evidence and should be given due weightage by courts. 1 (1999) 3 SCC 573 2 (2002) 6 SCC 404 APPAIYA v. ANDIMUTHU @ THANGAPANDI & ORS. 531 [C.T. RAVIKUMAR, J.] 11. In the context of the contentions raised by the appellants relying on the decisions referred (supra) it is only apposite to look into the question, “what is substantial question of law”. 12. In the decision in Lankeshwar Malakar v. R. Deka3, it was held that in to be substantial question of law, the test is whether it is of general public importance or whether it directly or substantially aff ects the right of the parties or whether the question is still open i.e., it is not fi nally settled by the Supreme Court, Federal Court or Privy Council. 13. In fact, in Santosh Hazari v. Purushottam Tiwari4 while exploring the meaning of the phrase “substantial question of law” this Court held: “12. The phrase “substantial question of law”, as occurring in the amended Section 100 is not defi ned in the Code. The word substantial, as qualifying “question of law”, means — of having substance, essential, real, of sound worth, important or considerable. It is to be understood as something in contradistinction with — technical, of no substance or consequence, or academic merely. However, it is clear that the legislature has chosen not to qualify the scope of “substantial question of law” by suffi xing the words “of general importance” as has been done in many other provisions such as Section 109 of the Code or Article 133(1)(a) of the Constitution. The substantial question of law on which a second appeal shall be heard need not necessarily be a substantial question of law of general importance. In Guran Ditta v. T. Ram Ditta [AIR 1928 PC 172 : 55 IA 235] , the phrase “substantial question of law” as it was employed in the last clause of the then existing Section 110 CPC (since omitted by the Amendment Act, 1973) came up for consideration and their Lordships held that it did not mean a substantial question of general importance but a substantial question of law which was involved in the case as between the parties. In Sir Chunilal V. Mehta & Sons Ltd. v. Century Spg. and Mfg. Co. Ltd. [1962 Supp (3) SCR 549] the Constitution Bench expressed agreement with the following view taken by a Full Bench 3 (2006) 13 SCC 570 4 (2001) 3 SCC 179 532 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. of the Madras High Court in Rimmalapudi Subba Rao v. Noony Veeraju AIR 1951 Mad 969] : “[W]hen a question of law is fairly arguable, where there is room for diff erence of opinion on it or where the Court thought it necessary to deal with that question at some length and discuss alternative views, then the question would be a substantial question of law.
