2045 of 2022, instituted by Brahmaputra Concrete Pipe Industries) founded on similar factual and legal grounds. These appeals have been filed under Rule 5 of XV of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 (hereinafter the “2013 Rules”). In this , we shall refer to the pleadings and s made in Misc. Application No.2045 of 2022 treating it as the lead matter. The said Rule reads:- “ XV PETITIONS GENERALLY . . . 5. The Registrar may refuse to receive a petition on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause or is frivolous or contains scandalous matter but the petitioner may within fifteen days of the making of such , appeal by way of motion, from such refusal to the Court. . . .” 762 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 2. The of the Registrar, which is under appeal before us, reads:- “The above mentioned Curative Petitions filed by M/s. Nuli & Nuli, Advocates against the dated 18.12.2019 passed in the Review Petitions were heard and disposed of in the Open Court. In this regard the relevant Rule 2(1), XLVIII, S.C.R., 2O13 reads as under: “The petitioner, in the curative petition, shall aver specifically that grounds mentioned therein had been taken in the Review Petition and that it was dismissed by circulation.” Since the aforesaid Review Petitions were disposed of in open court and not by circulation, the aforementioned Curative Petitions are declined for registration and are lodged under XV Rule 5 of Supreme Court Rules, 2013. Inform the Advocate accordingly.” 3. The origin of the dispute ultimately leading to passing of the aforesaid relates to maintainability of a suit instituted by the appellant under “The Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993” (the 1993 Act). The suit of the appellant was decreed by the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Tinsukia, Assam (Trial Court) but was dismissed by the High Court in appeal mainly on the ground of the suit not being maintainable. The High Court, inter-alia, held that the suit under the 1993 Act would not lie in respect of the transactions which had taken place prior to 23.09.1992, the date on which the Act became operational. The appeal against the High Court was dismissed by a three Judge Bench of this Court on 23.01.2019. The plea of review of the said also failed and the review petition was dismissed on 18.12.2019 after open court hearing. In this , we shall deal with the legality of the Registrar’s refusing to receive the curative petitions of the appellants. 4. The 1993 Act was preceded by an ordinance permitting certain small scale industrial undertakings to claim interest on delayed payment. That ordinance was promulgated on 23.09.1992. The ordinance later [2024] 2 S.C.R. 763 M/S Brahmaputra Concrete Pipe Industries Etc. Etc. v. The Assam State Electricity Board and Others transformed into the aforesaid statute. A question arose as to whether the right to sue for interest under the said Act could relate back to delayed payments made under agreements entered into before the date of promulgation of the ordinance or not.
