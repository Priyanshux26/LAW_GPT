11. SLP (C) Nos. 2063-2066 of 2020, which were thereafter G numbered as Civil Appeal Nos. 5692-5695 of 2021, arose out of the common dated 03.07.2019 in so far as it pertained to W.P.Nos.26234 & 26028 of 2013 and W.P.Nos.10282 & 10283 of 2015 respectively. V. Thirunarayanan, the second petitioner in W.P.No.26028 of 2013, and C.S. Gopalakrishnan, the sole petitioner in W.P.No.26234 of 2013, filed the first two SLPs aggrieved by the common to the H C.S. GOPALAKRISHNAN ETC. v. THE STATE OF TAMIL 949 NADU & OTHERS [SANJAY KUMAR, J.] extent that it did not hold the Industrial Purposes Act to be void on the A grounds of arbitrariness and violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. The other two SLPs filed by them pertained to W.P.Nos.10282 and 10283 of 2015 respectively, relating to the validity of Act No.1 of 2015 and Section 105-A. 12. During the pendency of these SLPs before this Court, the B State of Tamil Nadu again attempted to revive the three State Acts by enacting ‘The Tamil Nadu Land Acquisition Laws (Revival of Operation, Amendment and Validation) Act, 2019’ (for brevity, ‘the Validation Act of 2019’). This Act received the assent of the President, under Article 254(2) of the Constitution, on 02.12.2019. It came into effect C retrospectively from 26.09.2013. The Validation Act of 2019 was challenged before this Court in a batch of writ petitions. By dated 29.06.2021, reported in G. Mohan Rao and others Vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others [AIR 2021 SC 3126], this Court held that the said enactment was a legitimate legislative exercise which was consistent with and fell within the four corners of Article 254 of the Constitution. D The writ petitions were, accordingly, dismissed. 13. It may be noted that one K.M. Vittal Babu and one T. Chinnappan had filed W.P.No.5893 of 2018 before the Madras High Court, wherein they had sought a declaration that Section 105-A inserted in the new LA Act by Act No.1 of 2015 was unconstitutional. This writ E petition was also clubbed with the batch of writ petitions, which came to be disposed of by the common dated 03.07.2019. While so, on 07.07.2021, K.M. Vittal Babu and T. Chinnappan filed I.A. No. 77573 of 2021 in SLP (C) Nos. 2063-2066 of 2020, which were numbered as Civil Appeal Nos. 5692-5695 of 2021, seeking to be impleaded therein. F They stated that the provisions of the Industrial Purposes Act are in pari materia with the provisions of the Highways Act, whereunder their lands were acquired, and as there was no separate petition dealing with the validity thereof, it was just and necessary that they get impleaded in SLP (C) Nos. 2063-2066 of 2020 so as to question the pari materia provisions of the Highways Act. Their impleadment application was G allowed on 09.09.2021. Surprisingly, two days later, on 11.07.2021, K.M. Vittal Babu chose to file SLP (C) Diary No. 15466 of 2021 in the context of W.P.No.21323 of 2015, referred to hereinbefore, wherein he was not a party.
