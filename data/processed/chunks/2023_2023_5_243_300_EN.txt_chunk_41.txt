In that background, the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 though competent under Section 7B(1) of E Act, 1955 suffers from the vice of non-application of mind and despite being prospective, is in fact ‘retroactive’ taking away the rights which were conferred also as a matter of policy of the Sovereign State. 57. Hence, the notification being sustainable prospectively, we hereby declare that the impugned portion of the notification which provides F for supersession of the notifications dated 11.04.2005, 05.01.2007 and 05.01.2009 and the clause 4(ii), its proviso and Explanation (1) thereto shall operate prospectively in respect of OCI cardholders who have secured the same subsequent to 04.03.2021. 58. We further hold that the petitioners in all these cases and all G other similarly placed OCI cardholders will be entitled to the rights and privileges which had been conferred on them earlier to the notification dated 04.03.2021 and could be availed by them notwithstanding the exclusion carved out in the notification dated 04.03.2021. The participation of the petitioners and similarly placed OCI cardholders in the selection H 300 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A process and the subsequent action based on the interim s passed herein or elsewhere shall stand regularised. 59. Notwithstanding the fact that we have held the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 to be valid with specific prospective effect in view of the power available to respondent No.1 under Section 7B(1) B of Act, 1955, keeping in perspective the wide ramification it may have in future also on the Indian diaspora and since it is claimed to be based on the policy decision of the Sovereign State, we expect that the same would be examined in the higher echelons of the Executive with reference to the rights already created. C 60. In terms of the above, all these petitions/ appeals are allowed in part to the above extent with no as to costs. 61. Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.
