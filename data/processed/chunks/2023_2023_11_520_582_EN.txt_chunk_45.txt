It may be that the petitioner is 582 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. a bootlegger within the meaning of Section 2(b) of the Act, but merely because he is a bootlegger he cannot be preventively detained under the provisions of the Act unless, as laid down in sub-section (4) of Section 3 of the Act, his activities as a bootlegger aff ect adversely or are likely to aff ect adversely the maintenance of public .” (Emphasis supplied) 70. The pronouncement in the case of Piyush Kantilal Mehta (supra) would be of no assistance in a case where the detaining authority, based on cogent material (i.e. multiple cases of dealing with liquor unsafe for human consumption), forms the opinion that the activity of boot-legger was prejudicial to the maintenance of public . 71. In the case on hand, the detaining authority has specifi cally stated in the grounds of detention that selling liquor by the appellant detenu and the consumption by the people of that locality was harmful to their health. Such statement is an expression of his subjective satisfaction that the activities of the detenu appellant is prejudicial to the maintenance of public . Not only that, the detaining authority has also recorded his satisfaction that it is necessary to prevent the detenu appellant from indulging further in such activities and this satisfaction has been drawn on the basis of the credible material on record. It is also well settled that whether the material was suffi cient or not is not for the Courts to decide by applying the objective basis as it is matter of subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority. 72. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we fi nd no error, much less error of law, in the impugned judgement of the High Court. 73. In the result, this appeal fails and is hereby dismissed.
