Ezra v. Secretary of State for India.11 The Calcutta High Court in that case expressed its inability to grant relief to the person whose property was being acquired, noting that the 1894 Act did not allow the landowners to raise objections against the acquisition. Consequently, the legislature thought it appropriate to amend the 1894 Act and insert a provision mandating that no declaration under Section 6 of the 1894 Act shall be issued unless time has been allowed to the ‘persons interested’ in the land to put in their objections. 10 Women’s Education Trust v. State of Haryana, (2013) 8 SCC 99, para 1. 11 1902 SCC OnLine Cal 179. 1016 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 18. The landowners thus became entitled to lodge their objections within thirty days of the notification published under Section 4 of the 1894 Act. The Collector is thereafter expected to give an opportunity of hearing to the objectors and make recommendations to the Appropriate Government after thorough consideration of their objections. Importantly, the hearing under Section 5A must be an effective opportunity and not an empty formality. If necessary, the Collector shall also make further enquiries and give final recommendations based on due application of mind.12 If it is found that there has been total and utter non-compliance with Section 5A, thereby causing severe prejudice to the landowner, the Court shall give such affected person an appropriate remedy and, if feasible, even vitiate the acquisition proceedings. 19. Having understood the nuances of Section 5A, we shall now proceed to analyse each issue separately. D.1. Maintainability of the respondents’ challenge D.1.1. Respondents who have not filed objections 20. The High Court has vitiated the acquisition proceedings on the premise that the hearing accorded under Section 5A was ineffective. NOIDA’s grievance is that the High Court has jumped to such a conclusion without taking notice of the fact that some of the writ petitioners had never lodged their objections. Having failed to avail the remedy under Section 5A, such landowners cannot be heard to say that they were deprived of personal hearing or that their objections were disposed of without any application of mind. 21. We find merit in NOIDA’s contention. We say so for this reason that while Section 5A(1) gives a “person interested” the right to file objections, Section 5A(2) affords only an “objector” the right to be heard. Given this conscious departure in the use of the terminology, a person cannot claim hearing as a matter of right under Section 5A(2) unless he has filed objections. This is what has been precisely held by this Court in Talson Real Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra,13 observing that: 12 Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v. Darius Shapur Chenai, (2005) 7 SCC 627, para 9. 13 Talson Real Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra (2007) 13 SCC 186, para 15 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1017 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. Darshan Lal Bohra & Ors. “15. […] In the present case, as noticed above, the respondents have wholly complied with the requirements of the provisions of law.
