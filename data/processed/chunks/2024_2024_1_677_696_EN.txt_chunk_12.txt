A further investigation is permissible even if of cognizance of offence has been taken by the Magistrate. 21. ……………………………………. 22. It is true that ordinarily all documents accompany the charge-sheet. But, in this case, some documents could not be filed which were not in the possession of CBI and the same were with GEQD. As indicated hereinbefore, the said documents are said to have been filed on 20-1-2006 whereas the appellant was arrested on 12-2-2006. The appellant does not contend that he has been prejudiced by not filing of such documents with the charge-sheet. No such plea in fact had been taken. Even if all the documents had not been filed, by reason thereof submission of charge- sheet itself does not become vitiated in law. The charge- sheet has been acted upon as an of cognizance had been passed on the basis thereof. The appellant has not questioned the said taking cognizance of the offence. Validity of the said charge-sheet is also not in question. 23 to 27.…………………………………. 28. It is now well settled that the court takes cognizance of an offence and not the offender. (See Anil Saran v. State of Bihar [(1995) 6 SCC 142 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 1051] and Popular Muthiah v. State [(2006) 7 SCC 296 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 245] .) 29. The power of a court to direct remand of an accused either in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the Code or sub-section (2) of Section 309 thereof will depend on the stages of the trial. Whereas sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the Code would be attracted in a case where cognizance has not been taken, sub-section (2) of Section 309 of the Code would be attracted only after cognizance has been taken. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 695 Central Bureau of Investigation v. Kapil Wadhawan & Anr. 30. If submission of Mr Rohatgi is to be accepted, the Magistrate was not only required to declare the charge- sheet illegal, he was also required to recall his own of taking cognizance. Ordinarily, he could not have done so. (See Adalat Prasad v. Rooplal Jindal [(2004) 7 SCC 338 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 1927], Subramanium Sethuraman v. State of Maharashtra [(2004) 13 SCC 324 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 242 : (2004) 7 Scale 733] and Everest Advertising (P) Ltd. v. State, Govt. of NCT of Delhi [(2007) 5 SCC 54 : (2007) 2 SCC (Cri) 444 : JT (2007) 5 SC 529].) It is also well settled that if a thing cannot be done directly, the same cannot be permitted to be done indirectly. If the taking cognizance exists, irrespective of the conduct of CBI in treating the investigation to be open or filing applications for remand of the accused to police custody or judicial remand under sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the Code stating that the further investigation was pending, would be of no consequence if in effect and substance such s were being passed by the court in exercise of its power under sub-section (2) of Section 309 of the Code.
