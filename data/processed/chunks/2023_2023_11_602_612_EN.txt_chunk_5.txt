Referring to its earlier in the matter of “Bhanwar Lal vs. Satyanarain” (1995) 1 SCC 6 this Court concluded thus: ‘11. In view of the aforesaid settled legal position, therefore, and in the light of the statutory scheme discussed by us earlier it must be held that Respondent 1 decree-holder’s application dated 6-5-1991 praying for issuance of warrant for delivery of possession with the aid of armed force, was in substance for removal of obstruction off ered by the appellant and others under 21, Rule 97 CPC and had to be adjudicated upon as enjoined by 21, Rule 97, sub-rule (2) read with 21, Rule 101 and 21, Rule 98. In this connection the Court had also to follow the procedure laid down by 21, Rule 105 which enjoins the executing court to which an application is made under any of the foregoing rules of the to fi x a date of hearing of the application. As the executing court refused to adjudicate upon the obstruction and the claim of the appellant who obstructed to the execution proceedings it had clearly failed to exercise jurisdiction vested in it by law. The High Court in revision also committed the same error by taking the view that such an application was not maintainable. It is of course true as submitted by learned counsel for the decree-holder that in para 4 of the under appeal the High Court has noted that there was some discrepancy about the khasra number. But these are passing observations. On the contrary in the subsequent paragraphs of the the High 610 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. Court has clearly held that such an application by the objector was not maintainable and his only remedy was to move an application under 21, Rule 99 after handing over possession and consideration of objection to delivery of possession by a stranger to the decree at any earlier stage was premature. It must, therefore, be held that neither the executing court nor the High Court in revision had considered the objection of the appellant against execution on merits. Consequently the impugned of the High Court as well as the of the executing court in Civil Execution Case No. 25 of 1990 dated 15-2-1996 are quashed and set aside and proceedings are remanded to the Court of Munsif II, Munger to re-decide the application of Respondent 1 decree-holder dated 6-5-1991 by treating it to be one under 21, Rule 97 for removal of obstruction of the appellant and after hearing the decree-holder as well as the appellant to adjudicate the claim of the appellant and to pass appropriate s under 21, Rule 97, sub-rule (2) CPC read with 21, Rule 98 CPC as indicated in the earlier part of this .’ 12. Similarly, in “Shreenath & Anr. Vs. Rajesh & Ors.” (1998) 4 SCC 543 this Court observed thus: ‘10. Under sub-clause (1) 21 Rule 35, the executing court delivers actual physical possession of the disputed property to the decree-holder and, if necessary, by removing any person bound by the decree who refuses to vacate the said property.
