The five police officials and the two doctors who were acquitted by the Trial Court were also convicted by the High Court. The High Court also observed that the investigation by the Gujarat police was not proper and that the Gujarat police had taken the investigation in the wrong direction from the beginning i.e., the day of registering the FIR. That the investigation was not only unsatisfactory but it also smacked of dishonest steps to shield the culprits. It was further observed that the earlier investigation had played the role of a villain in the case. The High Court while going through the evidence also noted that “the truth and the falsehood are mixed up in such a manner that at every stage of investigation the truth is hidden under layers of intentional laxity, omissions, contradictions and falsehood and the truth is required to be unearthed”. 3.6. All the persons convicted filed Special Leave Petitions against the of the High Court. This Court vide dated 10.07.2017 passed in SLP (Crl.) Nos.4290/2017, 4705/2017 and 4716/2017 and by dated 20.11.2017 passed in SLP (Crl.) No.7831/2017 dismissed the Special Leave Petitions preferred by the convicts and upheld the findings rendered by the High Court, as well as the sentence awarded. 766 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 3.7. It is noteworthy that the petitioner-victim approached this Court by way of Criminal Appeal Nos.727-733 of 2019 seeking just and adequate compensation for her ordeals. This Court vide dated 23.04.2019 observed that the petitioner is a victim of riots which occurred in the aftermath of the Godhra train burning. This Court noted that the petitioner’s case had to be dealt with differently as the loss she has suffered surpassed normal cases. That the gruesome and horrific acts of violence had left an indelible imprint on the mind of the petitioner, which will continue to torment and cripple her. This Court therefore directed the State Government to pay Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Lakhs) to the petitioner within two weeks noting that the petitioner had been coerced into living the life of a nomad and an orphan and was barely sustaining herself on the charity of NGOs, having lost her family members. 3.8. After undergoing 14 years 5 months and 6 days of his sentence, respondent No.3 herein, namely, Radheshyam Bhagwandas Shah, filed Criminal Application No.4573 of 2019 before the Gujarat High Court challenging the non-consideration of his application for premature release under Sections 433 and 433A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter, the “CrPC” for the sake of brevity). The High Court after considering the submissions observed that respondent No.3 herein had been tried in the State of Maharashtra, hence, as per Section 432 (7), the ‘appropriate government’ for the purpose of Sections 432 and 433 of the CrPC would be the State of Maharashtra. The High Court placed reliance on the dictum of this Court in Union of India vs. V. Sriharan, (2016) 7 SCC 1 (“V. Sriharan”) and by dated 17.07.2019 directed the petitioner therein (respondent No.3 herein) to pursue his remedy within the State of Maharashtra.
