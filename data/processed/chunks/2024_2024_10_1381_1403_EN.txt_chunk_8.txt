Royalty cannot be tax. We declare that even in India Cement Ltd. [India Cement Ltd. v. State of T.N. (1990) 1 SCC 12] it was not the finding of the Court that royalty is a tax. A statement caused by an apparent typographical or inadvertent error in a of the Court should not be misunderstood as declaration of such law by the Court. We also record our express dissent with that part of the in Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd. [State of M.P. v. Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd., 1995 Supp (1) SCC 642] which says (vide para 12 of SCC report) that there was no “typographical error” in India Cement [India Cement Ltd. v. State of T.N. (1990) 1 SCC 12] and that the said conclusion that royalty is a tax logically flew from the earlier paragraphs of the .” 51. In State of H.P. v. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd. [State of H.P. v. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd. (2005) 6 SCC 499] , a Bench of three Judges of this Court observed : (SCC pp. 530-31, paras 44-46) “44. “Royalty” is not a term used in legal parlance for the price of the goods sold. It is a payment reserved by the grantor of a patent, lease of a mine or similar right, and payable proportionately to the use made of the right by the grantee as held in Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. case [State of Orissa v. Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd., 1985 Supp SCC 280 : 1985 SCC (Tax) 538] . 45. In its primary and natural sense “royalty” in the legal world, is known as the equivalent or translation of “jura regalia” or “jura regia”. Royal rights and prerogatives of a sovereign are covered thereunder. In its secondary sense, the word “royalty” would signify, as in mining leases, that part of the reddendum, [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1391 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v. M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. variable though, payable in cash or kind, for rights and privileges obtained. (See Inderjeet Singh Sial v. Karam Chand Thapar [Inderjeet Singh Sial v. Karam Chand Thapar (1995) 6 SCC 166] .) 46. “Royalty” is not a tax. Simply because the royalty is levied by reference to the quantity of the minerals produced and the impugned cess too is quantified by taking into consideration the same quantity of the mineral produced, the latter does not become royalty. The former is the rent of the land on which the mine is situated or the price of the privilege of winning the minerals from the land parted with by the Government in favour of the mining lessee. The cess is a levy on mineral rights with impact on the land and quantified by reference to the quantum of mineral produced. The distinction, though fine, yet exists and is perceptible. (See State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. [State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (2004) 10 SCC 201] )” 52. On the essential characteristics of a tax, the following observations of Banumathi, J. in the concurring opinion in Jindal Stainless Ltd. v. State of Haryana [Jindal Stainless Ltd. v. State of Haryana (2017) 12 SCC 1] cull out the essence : (SCC p. 297, para 334) “334.
