[Para 13.1][312-D-H; 313- A-B] 2. In the present case, the exclusion has no nexus with the G object and purpose of enacting Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act to be achieved. No reasonable intelligible differentia has been shown and therefore, the same can be termed as arbitrary. This Court is of the firm opinion that Section 10(26AAA) to the extent it excludes the Old Indian settlers, who have settled in H Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975, ASSOCIATION OF OLD SETTLERS OF SIKKIM AND ORS. v. 293 UNION OF INDIA AND ANR. but whose names are not recorded as “Sikkim Subjects”, from A the definition of “Sikkimese” is ultra vires, being arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The definition of “Sikkimese” in Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act shall also include all Indians, who have permanently settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with B India on 26.04.1975 irrespective of the fact that whether their names have been recorded in the register maintained under the Sikkim Subjects Regulations, 1961 or not. Therefore, the “Sikkimese” like the petitioners, who are old Indian settlers and who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975 shall also be entitled to the exemption under C Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. [Paras 13.4 and 14][313-G; 314-B-D] 3. So far as the challenge to the Proviso to Section 10(26AAA) insofar as it excludes from the exempted category, “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after D 01.04.2008” is concerned, there is no justification shown and/or demonstrated to exclude “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” from the exempted category. Apart from the above, the same is clearly hit by Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The discrimination is based E on gender, which is wholly violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. There is no disqualification for a Sikkim man, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008. A woman is not a chattel and has an identity of her own, and the mere factum of being married ought not to take away that identity. [Para 15][314-D-G] F 4. There is no justification shown to exclude “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008”. A Sikkimese woman, who has married a non-Sikkimese prior to 01.04.2008 is entitled to the benefit of exemption provided under Section 10(26AAA). There is no justification shown to fix the cut G off date of 01.04.2008. There is no rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by excluding “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” and to include “a Sikkimese woman, who has married a non-Sikkimese before 01.04.2008”. Therefore, to deny the benefit of exemption under Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act to “a Sikkimese H 294 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” is arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
