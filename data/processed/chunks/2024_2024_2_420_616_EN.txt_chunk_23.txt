(2) A company, not being a company referred to in clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1), may 454 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports permit contributions to political parties and for political purposes once again. The explanation of the phrase “political purpose” included donations made to a person who in the knowledge of the donor is carrying out any activity at the time of donation which can be regarded as public support to a political party. Further, the direct or indirect expenditure by companies on advertisements by or on behalf of political parties or publications for the advantage of a political party were also regarded as contributions for political purposes. Three other restrictions, in addition to the earlier restriction prescribing a cap on contributions and disclosure requirement were included. First, the company (which is not a government company) should have been in existence for more than three years; second, contributions could only be made when a resolution authorizing the contributions had been passed at a meeting of the Board of Directors; and third, the penal consequences attached to the violations of the provision were contribute any amount or amounts directly or indirectly- (a) 10 any political party,- (b) for any political purpose to any person: Provided that the amount or, as the case may be, the aggregate of the amounts which may be so contributed by a company in any financial year shall not exceed five percent of its average net profits determined in accordance with the provisions of sections 349 and 350 during the three preceding financial years. Explanation.- Where a portion of a financial year of the company falls before the commencement of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1985, and a portion falls after such commencement, the latter portion shall be deemed to be a financial year within the meaning, and for the purposes of this sub-section: Provided further that no such contribution shall be made by a company unless a resolution authorizing the making of such contribution is passed at a meeting of the Board of Directors and such resolution shall, subject to the other provisions of this section, be deemed to be justification in law for the making and the acceptance of the contribution authorized by it. (3) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2)- (a) 8 donation or subscription or payment caused to be given by a company on its behalf or on its account to a person who, to its knowledge, is carrying on any activity which, at the time at which such donation or subscription or payment was given or made, can reasonably be regarded as likely to effect public support for a political party shall also be deemed to be contribution of the amount of such donation, subscription or payment to such person for a political purpose; (6b) the amount of expenditure incurred, directly or indirectly, by a company on advertisement in any publication (being a publication in the nature of a souvenir brochure, tract, pamphlet or the like) by or on behalf of a political party or for its advantage, shall also be deemed,- (i) | where such publication is by or on behalf of a political party, to be a contribution of such amount to such political party, and (ii) | where such publication is not by or on behalf of but for the advantage of a political party, to be a contribution for a political purpose to the publishing it.
