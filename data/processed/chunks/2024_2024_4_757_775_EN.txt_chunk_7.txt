Digital Supreme Court Reports or intentional tort. In simple terms, a person who has an eggshell skull is one who would be more severely impacted by an act, which an otherwise “normal person” would be able to withstand. Hence the term eggshell to denote this as an eggshell is by its very nature, brittle. It is otherwise termed as “taking the victim as one finds them” and, therefore, a doer of an act would be liable for the otherwise more severe impact that such an act may have on the victim. 12.4.2 This rule is well recognized and has often formed the basis of which compensation has been awarded in countries such as the United States of America. So much so, that a famous treatise records as follows “Extensive research has failed to identify a single United States case disavowing the rule”17 Its origins, if not by that name, have been traced back to 1891 in a decision of the Washington State Supreme Court- Vasburg v. Putney18. In this case, arising out of a common childhood altercation, Putney, a twelve-year-old child had kicked the fourteen-year-old Vasburg, which aggravated a previous injury (of which Putney was not aware), leading to his permanent incapacitation. Putney was held liable. The Court opined “the wrongdoer is liable for all the injuries resulting directly from the wrongful act, whether they could or could not have been foreseen by him”. 12.4.3 The jurisprudence of the application of this rule, as has developed, (needless to add, in countries other than India) has fit into four categories19- first, when a latent condition of the plaintiff has been unearthed; second, when the negligence on the part of the wrongdoer re- activates a plaintiff’s pre-existing condition that had subsided due to treatment; third, wrongdoer’s actions aggravate known, pre-existing conditions, that have not yet received medical attention; and fourth, when the 17 Mark A.

Buelher, Eggshell Economics: A Revolutionary Approach to the Eggshell Plaintiff Rule, 74 Ohio St. L.J 375 (2013) [2024] 4 S.C.R. 769 Jyoti Devi v. Suket Hospital & Ors. wrongdoer’s actions accelerate an inevitable disability or loss of life due to a condition possessed by the plaintiff, even when the eventuality would have occurred with time, in the absence of the wrongdoer’s actions. As these categories and, the name of the rule itself suggest, the persons to whose 20cases this rule can be applied, are persons who have pre-existing conditions.21 Therefore, for this rule to be appropriately invoked and applied, the person in whose case an adjudicatory authority applies must have a pre-existing condition falling into either of the four categories described above. 12.4.4 It would be opportune to refer to a few s across jurisdictions to better discern the application of this rule.  The King’s Bench in Dulieu v. While & Sons22 while speaking in reference to American cases cited at that Bar where the New York Court had refused to pay compensation for ‘fright’ to a woman who while waiting for a tram, was nearly run-over by a horse- drawn cart, and as result of the same fainted, suffer a miscarriage and subsequent illness; observed: “It may be admitted that the plaintiff in this American case would not have suffered exactly as she did, and probably not to the same extent as she did, if she had not been pregnant at the time; and no doubt the defendants’ horses could not anticipate that she was in this condition.
