When less competition was there, the audit reports were qualified. When there was no ceiling, a member was free to accept any number of Tax Audits as a result of which there was more competition finally resulting in unqualified audit reports.” 3.18 Considering that fourteen years had passed since the last ceiling limit was fixed in 1989 and that the number of persons eligible to tax audit had considerably increased due to the change in limits prescribed under Section 44AB, IT Act, 1961, the Financial Law Committee meeting of the respondent-Institute, held on 12.09.2003, recommended that the Council may increase the ceiling limit for tax audit assignments to fifty. However, the Council at its 236th Meeting decided against increasing the limit from thirty to fifty tax audits per member. 3.19 In exercise of powers conferred on the respondent-Institute by clauses (c) and (d) of Sub-section (2) of Section 29A, read with Sub-section (4) of Section 21 and Sub-sections (2) and (4) of Section 21B of the 1949 Act, the Central Government notified the Chartered Accountants (Procedure of Investigations of Professional and Other Misconduct and Conduct of Cases) Rules, 2007. The said Rules came into effect from 27.02.2007. 800 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 3.20 At the 268th Meeting, held on 30.04.2007 – 02.05.2007, the Council discussed whether it should revise the ceiling limit on number of tax audits. The Council was divided on the issue whether the Council should increase the ceiling limit of tax audits although factors such as the increased permeation of access to technology and consequential increased professional competence of auditors, dynamic and increasing economy, growth of new and specialized areas of practices, and such other factors prevailed. The Council, finally authorized its President to decide upon an appropriate increase in the ceiling on number of tax audits after taking into consideration the views expressed by its members. In pursuance thereof, on 11.05.2007, the respondent-Institute increased the limit on number of tax audits from thirty to forty-five per Chartered Accountant per year. 3.21 At this stage it is pertinent to note that the respondent-Institute was of the opinion that the extant self-regulatory mechanism was ineffective in ensuring compliance of the maximum limit. Therefore, the 1949 Act was amended by the Parliament by the Chartered Accountants (Amendment) Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as “Amendment Act, 2006”) by which the erstwhile Notifications were superseded by Guidelines dated 08.08.2008. In view of the above development, this Court by dated 01.04.2013 dismissed the Civil Appeal Nos.7208-7209 of 2005 as having become infructuous. For ease of reference, the said is extracted as under: “Civil Appeal No(s). 7208-7209 of 2005 Decided on April 1, 2013 These appeals have been preferred against the impugned and dated 24.3.2005 passed in Writ Appeal No .1452 & 1453/1998 by the High Court of Madras quashing the notifications issued by the appellant by which it has quashed the notifications dated 25.5.1987 and 13.1.1989 by which certain regulatory measures have been taken by the appellant against its members.
