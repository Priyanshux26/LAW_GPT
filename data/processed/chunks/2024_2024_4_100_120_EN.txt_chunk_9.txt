While dealing with the said question, the three-Judge Bench referred to earlier decisions and the Constitution Bench decision in H.R. Adyanthaya [(1994) 5 SCC 737 : 1994 SCC (L&S) 1283] and opined that : (Mukesh K. Tripathi case [(2004) 8 SCC 387 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1128] , SCC p. 396, paras 21-23) “21. Once the ratio of May and Baker [AIR 1967 SC 678] and other decisions following the same had been reiterated despite observations made to the effect that S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] and other decisions following the same were rendered on the facts of that case, we are of the opinion that this Court had approved the reasonings of May and Baker [AIR 1967 SC 678] and subsequent decisions in preference to S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] . 22. The Constitution Bench further took notice of the subsequent amendment in the definition of ‘workman’ and held that even the legislature impliedly did not accept the said interpretation of this Court in S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] and other decisions. 23. It may be true, as has been submitted by Ms Jaising, that S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] has not been expressly overruled in H.R. Adyanthaya [(1994) 5 SCC 737 : 1994 SCC (L&S) 1283] but once the said decision has been held to have been rendered perincuriam it cannot be said to have laid down a good law. This Court is bound by the decision of the Constitution Bench.” We respectfully agree with the aforesaid exposition of law. There can be no cavil over the proposition that once a has been declared per incuriam, it does not have the precedential value. After so stating, the three-Judge Bench did not accept the stand of the appellant therein that he was a workman and accordingly declined to interfere. 11. As has been stated earlier, the decision that was pressed into service in the application filed for review is the in R. Suresh [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] . In the said case, the question that was posed in the beginning of the reads thus : (SCC p. 321, para 2) “2. Whether jurisdiction of the Industrial Courts is ousted in regard to an of dismissal passed by Life Insurance Corporation of India, a corporation constituted and incorporated under the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, is the question involved in this appeal which arises out of a and dated 3-2-2006 [LIC v. Industrial Tribunal, Writ Appeal No. 3360 of 2001, decided on 3-2-2006 (Ker)] passed by a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court at Ernakulam.” 12. The facts of R. Suresh case [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] that were the subject- matter of the lis in the said case were that the respondent was appointed as a Development Officer of LIC and a departmental proceeding was initiated against him and eventually he was found guilty in respect of certain charges and was dismissed from service by the disciplinary authority.
