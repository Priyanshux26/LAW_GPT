[2024] 6 S.C.R. 233 Union of India & Anr. v. Dr. Asket Singh & Ors. 10. Considering the huge delay involved in payment of compensation, the High Court has rightly granted solatium and interest in terms of the decisions of this Court. In fact, we are surprised to note that the appellants have dragged the first respondent to this Court. There is absolutely no merit in these appeals. As the first respondent has been paid compensation 7 years back, we are refraining from imposing costs. 11. Hence, the appeals are dismissed.
