Union of India and Ors. earn livelihood is integral to the dignity of an individual. Charging exorbitant enrolment fees and miscellaneous fees as a pre-condition for enrolment creates a barrier to entry into the legal profession. The levy of exorbitant fees as a pre-condition to enrolment serves to denigrate the dignity of those who face social and economic barriers in the advancement of their legal careers.97 This effectively perpetuates systemic discrimination against persons from marginalized and economically weaker sections by undermining their equal participation in the legal profession. Therefore, the current enrolment fee structure charged by the SBCs is contrary to the principle of substantive equality. 91. In Ravinder Kumar Dhariwal v. Union of India,98 a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that substantive equality is aimed at producing equality of outcomes through different modes of affirmative action. The purpose of the Advocates Act of creating an inclusive Bar cannot be defeated by having exclusionary conditions which seek to create social and economic barriers. The Bar Councils have a responsibility in the public interest to ensure greater representation of persons from marginalized communities in the legal profession. 92. The decision of the SBCs to charge exorbitant fees also suffers from the vice of manifest arbitrariness. In Khoday Distilleries Ltd v. State of Karnataka,99 this Court laid down the following principles for challenging delegated legislation: (i) the test of arbitrary action which applies to executive actions does not necessarily apply to delegated legislation; (ii) a delegated legislation can be struck down only if it is manifestly arbitrary; and (iii) a delegated legislation is manifestly arbitrary if it is not in conformity with the statute or offends Article 14. In Clariant International Ltd. v. SEBI,100 a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that when any criterion is fixed by a statute or by a policy, the subordinate authority must follow the policy formulation broadly and substantially. Non-conformity with the legislative policy will render delegated legislation arbitrary.101 97 See Neil Aurelio Nunes (supra) [35] 98 (2023) 2 SCC 209 [37] 99 [1995] Supp. 6 SCR 759 : (1996) 10 SCC 304 [13] 100 [2004] Supp. 3 SCR 843 : (2004) 8 SCC 524 [63] 101 Secretary, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, Government of India v.
