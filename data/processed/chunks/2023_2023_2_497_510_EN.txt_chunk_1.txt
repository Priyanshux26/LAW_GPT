There was a clear lack of consensus on this inclusion. Both the Courts’ interpretation of reading the appellants’ consent into the same is clearly an exercise in overreach. Both Courts have, by selectively perusing the emails, altered the terms of the decree to include the loan amount into D the agreement consideration. Such a reading was despite the clauses in the joint venture agreement entered into between the parties in 2017 which provided for separate mechanism of settling all outstanding loans. The joint venture agreement also contemplated a clear distinguishment between the bidding E process and subsequent repayment of loan. An Executing Court can construe a decree if it is ambiguous. However, as in the facts of the case herein, this cannot result in additions (to the terms of the consent, embodied in the email dated 28.03.2019) which were not agreed upon by the parties, since the decree was drawn on by consent of both parties at admissions stage itself. Both the single F judge and Division Bench of the High Court have interpreted the appellants’ silence (manifest in their not filing any written statement) as acquiescence to the inclusion of the loan amount, which, is although worthy of adverse inference, cannot be the reason to justify expansion of the decree.
