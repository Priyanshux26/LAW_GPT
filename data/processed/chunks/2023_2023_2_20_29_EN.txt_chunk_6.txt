It held that there is double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, D the presumption of innocence that is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by E the court. It has been further held that if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the Appellate Court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court. 21. We find that the view taken by the trial court could not be said to be either perverse or illegal/impossible to warrant interference. The High Court has grossly erred in interfering with the well-reasoned F and of acquittal passed by the trial court. 22. In the result, we pass the following : (i) The appeal is allowed; (ii) The impugned and dated 15th December 2008 G passed by the High Court at Calcutta in Government Appeal No. 38 of 1987 convicting the appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC is quashed and set aside; and H 3 (2022) 3 SCC 471 NIKHIL CHANDRA MONDAL v. STATE OF WEST BENGAL 29 [B. R. GAVAI, J.] (iii) The and dated 31st March 1987 passed by the A trial court acquitting the appellant from the charges levelled against him is affirmed. 23. The appellant is directed to be set at liberty forthwith if not required in any other case. B 24. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Nidhi Jain Appeal allowed.
