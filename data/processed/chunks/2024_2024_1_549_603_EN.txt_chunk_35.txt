Retroactive statute means a statute which creates a new obligation on transactions or considerations already past or destroys or impairs vested rights.” 17. Thus, whereas the prospective statute operates from the date of its enactments conferring new rights, the retrospective statute operates backwards and takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under the existing laws. A retroactive statute is one that does not operate retrospectively, however depending upon the status and nature of the events or transactions, the operation of the statute is extended or given effect from the date prior to its enactment. So far as the Amendment Act, 2018 is concerned, it has been made applicable specifically from the date of its notification i.e. 26.07.2018. 18. In Hitendra Vishnu Thakur and Others vs. State of Maharashtra and Others14, it was held by this Court that a statute which not only changes the procedure but also creates new rights and liabilities shall be construed to be prospective in operation unless otherwise provided either expressly or by necessary implication. The ratio of the said in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur was also followed in G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana15. 19. In State of Telangana vs. Managipet @ Mangipet Sarveshwar Reddy16, this Court rejected the arguments that the amended provisions of the PC Act would be applicable to an FIR registered before the said amendment came into force. 20. In a very recent decision in the case of State of Rajasthan vs. Tejmal Choudhary17, this Court set-aside the interim passed by the High Court which had quashed the proceedings only on the 14 (1994) 4 SCC 602 15 (2019) 19 SCC 469 16 (2019) 19 SCC 87 17 (2021) SCC OnLine SC 3477 598 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports ground that the approval was not obtained under Section 17A of the PC Act, by observing inter alia that the legislative intent in the enactment of a statute is to be gathered from the express words used in the statute, unless the plain words literally construed give rise to absurd results. It has been further observed therein that this Court has to go by the plain words of the statute to construe the legislative intent, and that it could not possibly have been the intent of the legislature that all pending investigations up to July 2018 should be rendered infructuous. 21. Apart from the afore-stated legal position, it is also required to be noted that while passing the Amendment Act 2018 by which the then existing offences under the PC Act were deleted and redefined, and by which some new offences were inserted, the Legislature had simultaneously introduced Section 17A. It was also stated in the Amendment Act that the same shall come into force from the date as may be notified by the Central Government. Therefore, it is required to be presumed that the intention of the legislature was to make Section 17A applicable only to the new offences as amended by Amendment Act, 2018 and not to the offences which existed prior to the coming into force of the Amendment Act 2018.
