In consequence, the three s which concluded otherwise i.e. Prabhu Lal (supra), Roshanben Rahemansha Fakir (supra) and Angad Kol (supra) are overruled based on the reasoning provided by us in this . The decision in Annappa Irappa Nesaria (supra) is partially overruled to the extent that the position even post-amendment would remain the same. VI. Is Mukund Dewangan (2017) per incuriam? 97. Shifting gears, we may recall that the decision in Mukund Dewangan (2017) was doubted for not noticing certain provisions of the MV Act and MV Rules. These include, inter alia, Section 4(1), 7, 14, the second proviso to Section 15 and Section 180 and 181 of the MV Act. It was therefore argued before this Court that the said decision is per incuriam. To begin with, it is useful to refer to some decisions that have expounded on the principle of per incuriam. 98. The term per incuriam is a Latin term which means ‘by inadvertence’ or ‘lack of care’. English Courts have developed this principle in relaxation of the rule of stare decisis. In Halsbury’s Laws of England,44 the concept of per incuriam was explained as under: 44 Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th Edn.) Vol. 26: and s: Judicial Decisions as Authorities (pp. 297-98, para 578) [2024] 11 S.C.R. 625 M/s Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rambha Devi & Ors. “A decision is given per incuriam when the court has acted in ignorance of a previous decision of its own or of a court of coordinate jurisdiction which covered the case before it, in which case it must decide which case to follow;45 or when it has acted in ignorance of a House of Lords decision, in which case it must follow that decision; or when the decision is given in ignorance of the terms of a statute or rule having statutory force.46 A decision should not be treated as given per incuriam, however, simply because of a deficiency of parties,47 or because the court had not the benefit of the best argument,48 and, as a general rule, the only cases in which decisions should be held to be given per incuriam are those given in ignorance of some inconsistent statute or binding authority.49 Even if a decision of the Court of Appeal has misinterpreted a previous decision of the House of Lords, the Court of Appeal must follow its previous decision and leave the House of Lords to rectify the mistake.” [emphasis supplied] 99. Lord Evershed in Morelle Ld. V. Wakeling50 (for short “Morelle”) explained the concept as under: “As a general rule the only cases in which decisions should be held to have been given per incuriam are those of decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provision or of some authority binding on the court concerned; so that in such cases some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found, on that account, to be demonstrably wrong” [emphasis supplied] 45 Young v.
