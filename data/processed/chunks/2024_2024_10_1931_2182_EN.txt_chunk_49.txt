One of the contentions before the nine- Judge Bench was that the State Legislature does not have any power under Entry 23 of List II because the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act 1957107 is a complete code that occupies the entire field relating to regulation of mines and mineral development. Rejecting the argument, the majority held that the words “to the extent to which” indicates that “besides declaring that it is taking under its control any subject relating to the regulation of mines and mineral development, Parliament has to specify the extent to which the Parliamentary regulation is deemed expedient in the public interest.”108 61. As opposed to Entry 54, Entry 52 does not use the words “to the extent to which”. The question is whether the State Legislature is 106 2024 INSC 554 107 “MMDRA” 108 2024 INSC 554 [158-161] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1997 State of U.P. & Ors. v. M/s Lalta Prasad Vaish and sons denuded from legislating on an industry which is controlled under the IDRA or any other similar legislation enacted under Article 246 read with Entry 52. Section 2 of IDRA provides that the Union takes control over the industries specified in the First Schedule. In Ishwari Khetan Sugar Mills v. State of UP,109 a Constitution Bench of this Court dealt with the constitutional validity of the UP Sugar Undertakings (Acquisition) Act 1971 which was challenged on the ground that the State Legislature lacked the legislative competence. While demarcating the scope of Entry 52 of List I and Entry 24 of list II, Justice D A Desai (writing for himself and two other Judges), observed that the degree and extent of control acquired by Parliament upon a declaration under Entry 52 would depend on the legislation enacted “spelling out the degree of control assumed”. The relevant observations are extracted below: “7. […] Entry 52 List I on its own language does not contemplate a bald declaration for assuming control over specified industries, but the declaration has to be by law to assume control of specified industries in public interest. The legislation enacted pursuant to the power to legislate acquired by declaration must be for assuming control over the industry and the declaration has to be made by law enacted, of which declaration would be an integral part. Legislation for assuming control containing the declaration will spell out the limit of control so assumed by the declaration. Therefore, the degree and extent of control that would be acquired by Parliament pursuant to the declaration would necessarily depend upon the legislation enacted spelling out the degree of control assumed. A mere declaration unaccompanied by law is incompatible with Entry 52 List I. A declaration for assuming control of specified industries coupled with law assuming control is a prerequisite for taking legislative action under Entry 52 List I. The declaration and the legislation pursuant to declaration to that extent denude the power of State Legislature to legislate under Entry 24 List II.” 109 [1980] 3 SCR 331 : (1980) 4 SCC 136 1998 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
