As settled in law, when an application to reject the plaint is filed, the averments in the plaint and the documents annexed therewith alone are germane. The averments in the application can be taken into account only to consider whether the case falls within any of the sub-rules of VII Rule 11 by considering the averments in the plaint. The Court cannot look into the written statement or the documents filed by the defendants. The Civil Courts including this Court cannot go into the rival contentions at that stage. Keeping in mind the legal position, let us examine whether the suit filed by the Respondent No.1 is barred by limitation, in the light of the averments contained in the plaint filed by him. 13. The Respondent No.1/Plaintiff claimed title, right and interest over the suit properties, stating that he is the direct descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj from the Bhonsale Dynasty and he has inherited the vast lands all over Maharashtra from his ancestors. He further stated in his plaint that Raja Shahu Chhatrapati gave only the rights of revenue grant to Guru Shree Jadhavgir Gosavi and the said grant did not give any rights in the lands to the Gosavi family and hence, they had no right to sell the suit properties to the Defendant No.1. Though the Respondent No.1 relied on the report of the Inam Commissioner appointed under the provisions of the Act XI, 1852, which stated that the grant enjoyed by the Respondent No.1’s ancestors was only a revenue grant and stated that Gosavis family 20 (1991) 4 SCC 1 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 1082 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1463 Shri Mukund Bhavan Trust and Ors. v. Shrimant Chhatrapati Udayan Raje Pratapsinh Maharaj Bhonsle and Another had no authority to create third party rights in the suit lands, the same was not substantiated with proper pleadings and documents. It was further stated by the Respondent No.1 that by dated 17.02.1980, the Government of Maharashtra was pleased to direct that the Satara Saranjam (Jagir / grant of land) shall be continued in the name of the Respondent No.1 / plaintiff, but, at that time, he was a minor. That apart, the Friendship Treaty was continued by the Government of Maharashtra vide its resolution dated 28.02.1980 and on attaining the age of majority by the plaintiff, the Maharashtra Government by resolution dated 01.09.1984 continued the said Saranjam upon the plaintiff. Hence, the Respondent No.1 continues to be the owner of the suit properties. We are unable to accept these statements. The averments in the plaint disclose that even prior to the alleged Resolution dated 28.02.1980, a major portion of the property (3/4th share) has been conveyed as early as in 1938 through Court auction and the remaining portion (1/4th share) in 1952. The plaintiff was a minor in 1980 and by 01.09.1984, he claims to have become a major. However, he has not stated as to when he was born. From the averments, it can be presumed that the plaintiff must have born in 1965/1966 considering the fact that he was declared as a major in 1984.
