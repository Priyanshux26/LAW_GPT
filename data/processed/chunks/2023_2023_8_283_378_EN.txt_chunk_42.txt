35 and 36 are office buildings at Shahbad and Bhalki, taken over by the Government after the Jagir Abolition Regulations and that after the States G Reorganisation, these buildings came to be located within the territorial limits of Mysore State and that they had been handed over to the Government of Mysore; (ii) that since these properties have vested with the Government by virtue of the provisions of the Jagir Abolition Regulations, H M/s TRINITY INFRAVENTURES LTD. & ORS. ETC. v. M. S. 347 MURTHY & ORS. ETC. [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] the parties were not entitled to claim the same as Khurshid A Jah’s Mathruka; (iii) that Item Nos.37, 38 and 40 are within the territorial limits of the district of Hyderabad and Item No.39 is in the district of Nalgonda; B (iv) that no claim was set up by the Government in relation to Item Nos.38 and 39 and the witnesses do not say that they were Makta lands or that they were taken over by the Government; (v) that as regards Item No.40, the title was in doubt; C (vi) that therefore Item Nos.35, 36, 37 and 40 must be deleted from the Plaint Schedule IV; (vii) that Item Nos.37 and 40 will be available for partition in case the Government released the same as a result of enquiry; D (viii) that enquiry into Inams or maktas is certainly not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Civil Court; and (ix) that therefore, Issue No.14(a) must be answered in the affirmative and Issue No.13(c) against the plaintiff. E 135. The entire discussion on Issue Nos.13(c) and 14(a) shows that the Trial Court did not actually record a clear finding as to how Item No.38 of Plaint Schedule IV belonged to the family and became liable for partition. The entire discussion revolved around Item Nos.35 to 40. By a process of elimination, the Court first deleted Item Nos.35 and 36, F on the ground that they were taken over by the Government after Jagir Abolition Regulations and that those properties had vested with the State of Mysore. Then the Court deleted Item Nos.37 and 40 on the ground that the title to the same was in suspension and that the answer to the question would depend upon the decision of the concerned Authorities. After thus eliminating Item Nos. 35, 36, 37 and 40, the Court simply G jumped to the conclusion that Item Nos. 38 and 39 were available for partition. This was despite the fact that even according to defendant No.1, these items were in the possession of the Government. The logic that the Court applied to Item Nos.35 and 36 were not applied to Item Nos.38 and 39. H 348 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 136. What is interesting is the way in which Issue No.14(a) was framed and the way it was answered. At the cost of repetition, we will 137. extract Issue No.14(a) which reads as follows:- “14(a). Are the properties mentioned in Items 37 to 40 of Schedule IV, the maktas and inam properties and, if so, B whether the civil court has no jurisdiction in relation to the same?” The answer to this question was rendered by the Court as follows: “Issue No.14(a) must be answered in the affirmative.” C 138.
