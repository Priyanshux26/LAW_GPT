17. The second challenge which has been addressed in the petition is to the proviso to Section 33 of the 1951 Act. Sub-section (1) of Section 33, in its substantive part, and the first proviso, are set out below: H LOK PRAHARI v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS 365 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] “33. Presentation of nomination paper and requirements for a A valid nomination.— (1) On or before the date appointed under clause (a) of section 30 each candidate shall, either in person or by his proposer, between the hours of eleven o’clock in the forenoon and three o’clock in the afternoon deliver to the returning officer B at the place specified in this behalf in the notice issued under section 31 a nomination paper completed in the prescribed form and signed by the candidate and by an elector of the constituency as proposer: Provided that a candidate not set up by a recognised political C party, shall not be deemed to be duly nominated for election from a constituency unless the nomination paper is subscribed by ten proposers being electors of the constituency.” 18. The proviso stipulates that a candidate who is not set up by a D recognized political party shall not be deemed to be duly nominated for election unless the nomination paper is subscribed by ten proposers who are electors of the constituency. 19. This lies purely in the realm of legislative policy. There is nothing per se discriminatory in the provision. Parliament is entitled to E regulate the manner in which nomination papers should be presented and the requirements for a valid nomination. 20. In view of the above discussion, we find no merit in the petition. The petition shall accordingly stand dismissed. 21. Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.
