4 was of 28.07.2003, which is subsequent to the filing of the suit. Respondent no. 4 executed the registered sale deed in favour of respondents 1-2 on 16.06.2004 which is during the operation of the temporary injunction . Thus, the alienation made by respondents, cannot operate against the interests of the appellant considering he had obtained an of temporary injunction in his favour. The same position has been held by this Court in a recent decision of Shivshankara and Another v. H.P. Vedavyasa Char (Supra), which has similar facts in the context of an injunction . 21. Once it has been held that the transactions executed by the respondents are illegal due to the doctrine of lis pendens the defence of the respondents 1-2 that they are bonafide purchasers for valuable consideration and thus, entitled to protection under Section 41 of the Act of 1882 is liable to be rejected. 22. We are presently not getting into the deposition of PW-7 though it is unusual and also whether respondents 1-2 had knowledge of the injunction, even though we find no substantial reasons for the High Court to base its entire decision on the deposition of this witness (PW-7). We are going by the settled position that subsequent 1158 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports purchasers will be bound by lis pendens and cannot claim they are bonafide purchasers because they were not aware of the injunction , looking at the peculiar facts of the present case. 23. Respondents 1-2 have also claimed they have made substantial alterations to the property by investing money and they have also installed a submersible pump. However, this cannot be the basis for the respondents to claim any sort of compensation or stake any sort of claim against the property. (See: Sardar Kar Bachan Singh v. Major S Kar Bhajan Singh, AIR 1975 P&H 205) 24. Consequently, the Release Deed dated 28.07.2003 executed by respondent no. 3 in favour of respondent no. 4 and the Sale Deed dated 16.06.2004 executed by respondent no. 4 in favour of respondents 1-2 is held to be without any legal sanctity. There was an of temporary injunction operating at the time when these transactions were made and the alienation made by the respondents cannot operate to the disadvantage of the appellant. Since the parties to these proceedings are bound by the doctrine of lis pendens the respondents 1-2 cannot take the protection of bonafide purchasers for valuable consideration. 25. Consequently, this appeal is allowed, the Judgement dated 03.10.2019 passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in RSA No. 2746 of 2012 is set aside. The decree in favour of the appellant is upheld. The respondent no. 3 is directed to accept the balance sale consideration of Rs.5,50,000 from the appellant and execute the agreement to sell dated 10.11.2002 in favour of the appellant, within 3 months from today. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Harshit Anand, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Kanu Agrawal, Adv.)
