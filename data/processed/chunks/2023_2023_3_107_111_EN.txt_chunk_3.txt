366.9. Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding C pending on the date of enforcement of the 2013 Act i.e. 1-1-2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.” D 3. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority (supra) to the facts of the case on hand, more particularly, the fact that physical possession of the subject land has been taken over and in fact the subject land has been put to use by the beneficiary department – Irrigation and Flood Control Board for E construction of Bankner Link Drain which has been duly built, there shall not be any lapse of the acquisition with regard to the subject land as observed and held by the High Court. The impugned and passed by the High Court is just contrary to the decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority F (supra), which is unsustainable. 4.
