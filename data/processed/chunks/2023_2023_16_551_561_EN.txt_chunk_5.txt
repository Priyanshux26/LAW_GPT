MANIK HIRU JHANGIANI v. STATE OF M.P 559 11. Under Section 16 of PFA, penalties have been prescribed. Under clause 1(i) of sub-section (1) of Section 16, misbranding within the meaning of Clause (ix) of Section 2 is an off ence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may not be less than six months, but it may extend to three years and with a fi ne of the minimum amount of Rupees one thousand. The procedure for taking cognizance is prescribed by Section 20. 12. As against this, Section 52 of FSSA provides for penalties for misbranded food. FSSA does not prescribe any punishment of imprisonment for misbranding, but the power under Section 52 is to impose a penalty, which may extend to Rupees 3 lakhs. 13. Thus, under the provisions of the PFA, for misbranding, a person can be sentenced to imprisonment of a minimum six months with a fi ne of Rupees one thousand and more. However, for a similar violation under the FSSA, there is no penal provision in the sense that there is no provision for sentencing the violator to undergo imprisonment and to pay a fi ne. Under the FSSA, only a penalty of up to Rupees 3 lakhs can be imposed. 14. We must note here that Sections 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,87,88,91 and 101 were brought into force with eff ect from 15th October 2007. Section 3 of the FSSA which defi nes ‘misbranded food’ came into force on 28th May 2008. As noted earlier, Section 97 which provides for repeal of the PFA was brought into force on 5th August 2011. Thus, the penal provisions of the PFA were in force till 5th August 2011. In this case, the alleged off ence was committed on 29th November 2010. Thus, on that day, Section 52 of FSSA was in force as also the provisions of the PFA and the PFA Rules. 15. At this stage, we may refer to sub-section (4) of Section 97 of FSSA, a sunset clause. Sub-section (4) of Section 97 reads thus: “(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no court shall take cognizance of an off ence under the repealed Act or s after the expiry of a period of three years from the date of the commencement of this Act.” 16. Sub-section (4) provides that notwithstanding the repeal of the PFA, cognizance of the off ence committed under the PFA can be taken within three years from the date of commencement of the FSSA. The implication of sub-section (4) of Section 97 is that if an off ence is committed under the (cid:0) ABHAY S. OKA, J. (cid:1) 560 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. PFA when the PFA was in force, cognizance of the crime can be taken only within three years from the date of commencement of the FSSA. 17. In this case, on the day on which the alleged off ence was committed, the off ender could have been sentenced to imprisonment under Section 16 of the PFA and under the FSSA, he could have been directed to pay the penalty up to Rupees 3 lakhs.
