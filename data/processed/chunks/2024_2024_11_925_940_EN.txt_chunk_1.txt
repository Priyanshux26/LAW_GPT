The bids were opened on 09.09.2020. The Tender Committee while it was finalizing the bids noticed that in respect of the land in question, a property tax demand to the tune of Rs. 1.25 crores was outstanding and the same was not taken into account while fixing the base price and, therefore, the Tender Committee arrived at a conclusion not to accept any 928 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the bids and to issue a fresh tender with a reserve price of Rs. 26,000/- per square meter. The matter was placed before the Board of IDA and on 27.07.2021, the Board accepted the recommendation of the Tender Committee. The bid of respondent No. 1 was rejected and it was resolved to issue a fresh NIT in the matter.
