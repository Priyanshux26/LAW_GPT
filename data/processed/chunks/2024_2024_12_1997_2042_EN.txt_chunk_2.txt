1, while challenging the fairness and legality of the toll collection and overall execution of the Agreement – The involvement of a public authority necessitates cognizance to ensure that the Agreement upholds constitutional principles – In such scenarios, it becomes the solemn duty of the judiciary, entrusted under the Constitution as an independent arbiter, to intervene and protect the interests of the public at large. [Paras 26, 27] 2. Second, it is crucial to recognise that when a contract involves a State instrumentality like NOIDA, significantly impacting the public, the metes and bounds of judicial review ought to be expanded – The State is duty-bound to act equitably and in accordance with the Public Trust Doctrine, ensuring that no action harms the broader public interest. [Para 28] 2000 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 3. It is evident that the High Court was justified in entertaining the petition filed by Respondent No. 1 in public interest – The continued levy of toll and the Concession Agreement were directly impacting the rights and interests of commuters – NTBCL’s attempts to classify the Concession Agreement as a purely private contractual matter, sequestered from such scrutiny, thus holds no ground – The Project, having been developed for public benefit, cannot escape judicial oversight, particularly when the allegations pertain to the public’s rights and interests, which are being infringed upon by the levying of user fees – Contention of NTBCL seeking dismissal of Respondent No. 1’s petition at the threshold was thus rightly rejected by the High Court. [Para 29] Contract – Award of contract for development and construction of DND Flyway project to NTBCL – Challenged, for not following any formal tender procedure – Contract awarded to NTBCL through the Concession Agreement by State authorities and NOIDA was unfair, unjust and inconsistent with Constitutional norms: Held:1. NTBCL entered into an agreement with NOIDA to undertake a project that involved an overwhelming public element, comprising of public funds and public assets – When such a project is undertaken by the State in partnership with a private entity, the element of public interest necessitates strict adherence to Constitutional obligations – The State is obligated to ensure that its actions remain free from any arbitrariness or capriciousness, particularly when public welfare is at stake. [Para 31] 2. Every action or decision of the State or its instrumentalities in conferring any form of largesse or benefit must be grounded in a just, transparent, and well-defined policy – Such a policy should be made known to the public through appropriate publication and implemented through non-discriminatory means, free from bias or favouritism – Even when the Government awards a contract or grants similar benefits, such bestowal must meet the standards of reasonableness and public interest – Should either of these criteria remain unmet, the conferment would be deemed unconstitutional – The golden principle is that Government procedures or policies pioneered in public interest must genuinely serve the public and not merely enrich private entities. [Paras 32, 35] 3. In the case in hand, the Government made no efforts to issue tenders, invitations, or seek competitive bids from other interested [2024] 12 S.C.R.
