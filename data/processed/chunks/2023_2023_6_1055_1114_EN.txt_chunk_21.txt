His main submission is that the expression of inquiry as employed in Section 9(2) of the 2015 Act ought to import the same meaning given to it under the Section 2 (g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“1973 Code”). In this regard he has referred to the cases of Ram Vijay Singh -vs- State of Uttar Pradesh [2021 SCC B OnLine SC 142] and Ashwani Kumar Saxena -vs- State of Madhya Pradesh [(2012) 9 SCC 750]. In the case of Ram Vijay Singh (supra), a Coordinate Bench of this Court found that the procedure prescribed in Rule 12 of the Rules made under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (“2000 Act”) is not materially different from C provisions of Section 94 of the 2015 Act. He wants us to distinguish the finding made by a Bench of two Judges of this Court in the case of Ashwani Kumar Saxena (supra), referring to the in the case of Abuzar Hossain alias Golam Hossain -vs- State of West Bengal [(2012) 10 SCC 489]. He has submitted that the Inquiring Judge, to comply with the mandate of Section 9(2) of the 2015 Act, ought to have D recorded evidence of the material witnesses on oath for determination of age but he hastily completed the inquiry. 13.Mr. Chitaley’s submissions are in the same line. Relying on decision of this Court in this case of Pawan Kumar Gupta -vs- State (NCT of Delhi) [(2020) 2 SCC 803], he has argued that once the E applicant’s plea for juvenility was dismissed, it was not open for him to resurrect the same claim. As regards the name of the applicant, he has emphasised the fact that the certificate of Sarpanch was forged and there was no documentary evidence to substantiate the claim. With regard to the entry in the voters’ list where Niranaram Chetanram Chaudhary’s F name appears, he has pointed out that the said list of 1993 showed the applicant to be of 18 years. His other submission is that the plea of juvenility ought to be raised in close proximity to institution of the proceedings. On this point the decisions relied upon by him are the cases of Murari Thakur & Another -vs- State of Bihar [(2009) 16 SCC 256], Pawan -vs- State of Uttaranchal [(2009) 15 SCC 259], Mohd. G Anwar -vs- State (NCT of Delhi) [(2020) 7 SCC 391] and Surajdeo Mahto & Another -vs- State of Bihar [(2022) 11 SCC 800]. Having regard to the gruesomeness of the offence, and involvement of the applicant having been proved at all levels of judicial hierarchy, he has drawn our attention to the following passage from the case of Abuzar H Hossain (supra):- NARAYAN CHETANRAM CHAUDHARY v. THE STATE OF 1085 MAHARASHTRA [ANIRUDDHA BOSE, J.] “39.6 Claim of juvenility lacking in credibility or frivolous A claim of juvenility or patently absurd or inherently improbable claim of juvenility must be rejected by the court at the threshold whenever raised.” 14.As would be evident from the reasoning contained in the said report, substantial stress was laid by the Inquiring Judge on the school B admission register, on the basis of which the “certificate” of date of birth was issued.
