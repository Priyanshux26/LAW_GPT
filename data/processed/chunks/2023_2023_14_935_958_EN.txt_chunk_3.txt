The reasoning of the original authority in this regard is extracted below: “The lands held by the opponents individually are measuring (23 ac. 29 gts. 9H. 83 R.) The land held by applicant is 13A 11 Gts. The applicant is entitled for possession of so much of the land as would result in both the landlord and tenants holding thereafter in the total and equal area for personal cultivation. The area of the land in dispute is 33 A 21 gts. I, therefore, that 22 A 00 gts. Twenty two acres of the land out of the land in dispute should be restored to 3 dated 17.04.1978 in Tenancy Case No.2/77 4 Sum total of land bearing Survey No. 291 and Survey No. 290/1&290/2 940 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. the landlord i.e., applicant. I further that the possession of the land may be given to the applicant, not earlier than sixty days after the close of the year.” 6. Both the landlord and the tenant preferred appeals against the of the original authority. The appeals were fi led in the Court of Assistant Collector, Rahuri Division, Ahmednagar (hereinafter referred to as, ‘the appellate authority’). The landlord preferred an appeal5 on the ground that the possession had not been granted in respect of the entire suit land. The tenant, on the other hand, had sought for interference6 on the ground that notice for termination of tenancy was invalid and that the landlord did not require the lands for bonafi de personal cultivation as he was already in possession of a substantial extent of revenue-bearing lands. 7. The appellate authority, vide a common dated 21.11.78, upheld the fi ndings of the original authority but modifi ed the extent of land, which was to be restored to the landlord. It held that the landlord was entitled to possession of 17 acres 17 guntas of the suit land. The appellate authority notes that the original authority’s direction for restoration of 22 acres of suit land proceeded on a misinterpretation of Section 31B of the Act. 8. Against the decision of the appellate authority, the landlord and the tenant fi led revision applications before Member of the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal, Pune (for short, the ‘revisional authority’).It was contended on behalf of the tenant7 that the notice was issued only in respect of Survey No. 291 and that there was no separate notice in respect of Survey No.290/1&290/2. It was further argued that the original authority ought to have framed an issue as to whether the subject in dispute was to be governed by notifi cation dated 14.2.1958 or the notifi cation as amended on 08.10.1969 (for short ‘amended notifi cation’) – the extent of land which could be ed to be resumed was dependent on the relevant notifi cation which applied, and therefore, in the absence of any fi nding on this question, both the authorities fell into grave error in their determination of the fi nal outcome. Accordingly, it was prayed that the case be remanded back to the original authority for 5 TNC A.
