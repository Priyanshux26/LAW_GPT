Two specific challenges have been set up to the vires of: (i) Rule 39-AA of the Conduct of Election Rules 19611; and G (ii) The proviso to Section 33 of the Representation of the People Act 19512. 1 “1961 Rules” 2 “1951 Act” H 360 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A 2. Article 80 of the Constitution provides for the composition of the Council of States. Article 80(1)(b) envisages that the Council of States shall consist of “not more than two hundred and thirty eight representative of the States and of the Union Territories”. The allocation of seats in the Council of States to be filled by representatives of the States and Union Territories is in accordance with the provisions contained B in the Fourth Schedule3. Clause (4) of Article 80 stipulates that the representatives of each State in the Council of States shall be elected by the elected members of the Legislative Assembly of the State in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. As regards the Legislative Councils, Article C 171(3)(d) stipulates that one-third of the members shall be elected by the members of the Legislative Assembly of the State from amongst persons who are not members of the Assembly. 3. According to the petitioner, for fifty years after the enactment of the 1951 Act, elections to both the Council of States and Legislative D Councils were conducted by secret ballot. However, by Act 40 of 2003, Sections 59, 94 and 128(1) of the 1951 Act were amended so as to provide for an open ballot system for elections to the Rajya Sabha. The proviso to Section 59 stipulates that the votes at every election to fill a seat or seats in the Council of States shall be given by open ballot. Section 94 which protects the secrecy of voting contains a proviso to E the effect that the Section shall not apply to a situation where the voting is by open ballot. A similar provision has been made in the proviso to Section 128(1). 4. Rule 39-AA of the 1961 Rules was inserted by a notification dated 27 February 2004. Rule 39-AA reads as follows: F “39AA.
