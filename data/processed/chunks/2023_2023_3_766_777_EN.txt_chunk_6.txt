Aggravating factors cannot be ignored and similarly mitigating circumstances have also to be taken into consideration. F 15. In our opinion, the measure of punishment in a given case must depend upon the atrocity of the crime; the conduct of the criminal and the defenceless and unprotected state of the victim. Imposition of appropriate punishment is the manner in which the courts respond to the society’s cry for justice against the criminals. G Justice demands that courts should impose punishment befitting to the crime so that the courts reflect public abhorrence of the crime. The courts must not only keep in view the rights of the criminal but also the rights of the victim of crime and the society at large while considering imposition of appropriate punishment.” H 774 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A 9. While considering this aspect, the Supreme Court in Mahesh v. State of M.P. [(1987) 3 SCC 80 : 1987 SCC (Cri) 379 : (1987) 2 SCR 710] remarked that: (SCC p. 82, para 6) “6. … it will be a mockery of justice to permit these appellants to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence B and such cruel acts. To give the lesser punishment for the appellants would be to render the justicing system of this country suspect. The common man will lose faith in courts.

The legislature has D bestowed upon the judiciary this enormous discretion in the sentencing policy, which must be exercised with utmost care and caution. The punishment awarded should be directly proportionate to the nature and the magnitude of the offence. The benchmark of proportionate sentencing can assist the Judges in arriving at a E fair and impartial verdict.” This Court further observed that: (Hazara Singh case [(2013) 9 SCC 516 : (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 159] , SCC p. 521, para 11) “11. The cardinal principle of sentencing policy is that the sentence imposed on an offender should reflect the crime he has committed F and it should be proportionate to the gravity of the offence.

State of Gujarat [(2006) 2 SCC 359 : (2006) 1 SCC (Cri) 499] the Apex Court opined that: (SCC G pp. 361-62, paras 7-8) “7.
