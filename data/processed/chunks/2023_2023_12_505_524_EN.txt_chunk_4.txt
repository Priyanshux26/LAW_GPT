Pursuant to Advisory Board’s recommendation dated 01.09.2022 07.03.2022, petitioner’s case (along with 7 others) was rejected without assigning any reasons. 6. The State in its counter affi davit explained its position - that while the petitioner has been considered for premature release 9 times, his case has been rejected repeatedly because: “while considering proposal for premature release of prisoners, the consistent stand now being adopted by the Government is that persons involved in the murder of women and children and persons convicted in off ences relating to POCSO cases shall not be granted premature release. Since the petitioner involved in the murder of a woman his premature release was rejected by Government in accordance with the above stand.” (emphasis supplied) Further, that in 2020, general guidelines were to be framed by a specially constituted committee5 for determining the eligibility of prisoners with regards to grant of premature release. This committee fi nally proposed premature release of 67 convicts (from those who had earlier been rejected for whatever reason) after assessing their individual cases. The state government by its proceeding dated 20.04.2022, approved the proposal excluding certain convicts who had been involved in: most cruel murder, committed murder of woman and children, or murder with rape, and those undergoing treatment for mental illness, whose relatives were reluctant to receive them. These restrictions, along with other more detailed guidelines, 5 This committee consisted of Additional Chief Secretary Home & Vigilance Department as Chairman, Law Secretary, and Director General of Prions and Correctional Services as Members. 512 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. have been incorporated in a government 6 dated 04.06.2022 issued by the Home Department of the State of Kerala. 7. On 01.09.2022, the state government rejected for the third time, the Advisory Board’s recommendation to release the petitioner. Aggrieved, the petitioner has preferred the present writ petition. Contentions of parties 8. Mr. Adolf Mathew, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, challenged the state government’s repeated rejection of his plea for premature release. It was pointed out that the remission policy prevailing on the date of the conviction would have to apply. Attention was drawn to Rule 545A of the 1958 Rules which stipulates release can be considered after 14 years; Rule 216(1), 244(2) and 299(c) of the 1958 Rules which state that the inmate shall be released after completion of 20 years of sentence; and the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) which prescribes mandatory release after 25 years of sentence. Furthermore, even in terms of Rule 377 of the new Prison Rules, 2014, the petitioner is entitled to release after 20 years. It was argued that since the petitioner has not only completed 14 years or 20 years, but even 25 years of actual imprisonment, at this juncture - regardless of which rules are applied, it was manifestly illegal to keep him incarcerated in perpetuity. 9. Mr. Mathew strongly opposed the state’s policy dated 14.06.2022 (and executive instruction dated 20.04.2022 cited in the state’s counter affi davit) which listed certain crimes, the commission of which put the convict beyond the scope for grant of remission.
