[Para 9.6] Penal Code, 1860 – s.149: Held: In to attract s.149, it must be shown by the prosecution that the incriminating act was done to accomplish the common object by such unlawful assembly – It must be within the knowledge of the other members as one likely to be committed in furtherance of the common object – Even if no overt act is imputed to the accused, the presence of the accused as part of the unlawful assembly is suffi cient for conviction – Inference of a common object has to be drawn from various factors such as the weapons with which NARESH @ NEHRU v. STATE OF HARYANA 773 the members were armed, their movements, the acts of violence committed by them, and the end result – In the present case, High Court held that every member had inhibited the common intention to accomplish the unlawful object – On facts, the motive alleged was a quarrel that ensued between one ‘R’ and ‘N’ with ‘A’ (the deceased) and ‘S’ on the day of Dulhandi and ‘R’ was said to have threatened to kill ‘A’ – This factor clearly discloses that the appellants herein were not involved in the fi ght that occurred on the day of Dulhandi and as such no motive could be attributed to the appellants – Prosecution failed to prove that the appellants shared a common object with other members of the alleged unlawful assembly – There is no evidence to connect the appellants with the deceased or the co-accused – No overt act was attributed to the appellants – PW-9 admitted in his cross-examination that none of the accused except ‘P’ had caused injury to the deceased and there was only a single shot fi red from the pistol.
