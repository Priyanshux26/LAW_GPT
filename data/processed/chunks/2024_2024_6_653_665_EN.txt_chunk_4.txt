PW-2 and PW-3, mother 5 [2012] 6 SCR 1153 : (2012) 8 SCC 21 : 2012 INSC 322 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 659 Selvamani v. The State Rep. By The Inspector of Police and aunt of the prosecutrix respectively, have also stated in their evidence that when the prosecutrix came home, she narrated the incident to them. The FIR came to be lodged immediately on the very same day. 6. The statement of the prosecutrix under Section 164 CrPC was also recorded before Smt. Lakshmi Ramesh, Judicial Magistrate (PW-6). PW-6 has also deposed about the prosecutrix, giving the statement and narrating the entire incident. 7. Dr. Indrani, Medical Expert (PW.8), who had examined the victim, has clearly stated that the prosecutrix was having injuries on her person. Her evidence establishes the fact that there was forcible sexual intercourse several times by several persons. Her evidence also shows that on account of the said incident, the victim lost her virginity and there were also abrasions on the private parts of the victim. 8. No doubt that the prosecutrix and her mother and aunt in their cross- examination, which was recorded three and a half months after the recording of the examination-in-chief, have turned around and not supported the prosecution case. 9. A 3-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Khujji @ Surendra Tiwari v. State of Madhya Pradesh6, relying on the s of this Court in the cases of Bhagwan Singh v. State of Haryana7, Sri Rabindra Kumar Dey v. State of Orissa8, Syad Akbar v. State of Karnataka9, has held that the evidence of a prosecution witness cannot be rejected in toto merely because the prosecution chose to treat him as hostile and cross-examined him. It was further held that the evidence of such witnesses cannot be treated as effaced or washed off the record altogether but the same can be accepted to the extent their version is found to be dependable on a careful scrutiny thereof. 10. This Court, in the case of C. Muniappan and Others v. State of Tamil Nadu10, has observed thus: 6 [1991] 3 SCR 1 : (1991) 3 SCC 627 : 1991 INSC 153 7 [1976] 2 SCR 921 : (1976) 1 SCC 389 : 1975 INSC 306 8 [1977] 1 SCR 439 : (1976) 4 SCC 233 : 1976 INSC 204 9 [1980] 1 SCR 95 : (1980) 1 SCC 30 : 1979 INSC 126 10 [2010] 10 SCR 262 : (2010) 9 SCC 567 : 2010 INSC 553 660 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
