Therefore, the CBI in exercising its powers under the DSPE Act, without the requisite State consent is not only violating Section 6, DSPE Act, but also usurping and ousting State/ Kolkata Police’s statutory jurisdiction over such offences. 23. Such action of the Defendant violates the Constitutional provisions, the DSPE Act, and derogates from the doctrine of federalism. By registration of these cases, the Defendant herein has rendered the provisions under Section 6 of the DSPE Act nugatory. 712 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 24. The requirement of obtaining consent of the concerned state to enable CBI to investigate in the said state under section 6 of the DSPE Act aligns with the principles of federalism as envisaged in the constitution which has vested the state with the power to exercise exclusive jurisdiction by making laws with respect to police under Entry 2 of the State List of the Seventh Schedule read with Article 246(3) of the Constitution of India. …………. 29. In accordance with the provisions of Constitution and the law interpreted by this Hon’ble Court, the Plaintiff State will suffer grave constitutional prejudice in case the Defendant is allowed to operate its own police force within the State of West Bengal in absence of previous approval of the Plaintiff State. Thus, there exists a dispute, involving of question of law and fact, between the Plaintiff State of West Bengal and the Defendant Union of India, regarding the encroachment of jurisdiction and encroachment of legal rights as a State and as well as for the enforcement of the fundamental, statutory constitutional and other legal rights of the State of West Bengal. Hence, this Original Suit under Article 131 of the Constitution of India is being preferred. 30. The action of the Defendant is an act of constitutional overreach inasmuch as by registering cases within the State of West Bengal in absence of the consent of the Plaintiff, the Defendant has exceeded its jurisdiction and has acted contrary to the scheme of Constitution and DSPE statute. 31. Such action of the Defendant also violates the law laid down by this Hon’ble Court that no investigation can be conducted within the territory of a State in absence of consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act (see Kazi Lehendup Dorji v. CBI, & Ors 1994 Supp (2) SCC 116 (para 4,9,17); Subramanian Swami v. CBI 2014 (8) SCC 682 (Para 67,68); State of West Bengal v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Right, West Bengal & Ors. 2013(3) SCC 571 (Para 35,37); Mayawati v. Union of India (2012) 8 SCC 106 (Para 9, 30, 41, 44); A.C Sharma [2024] 7 S.C.R. 713 The State of West Bengal v. Union of India v. Delhi Administration, 1973 (1) SCC 726 (Para 13); M Balakrishnan v. Director, CBI Delhi 2008 (4) SCC 409 (Para 18, 19)). 32. It is well settled that when differences arise between the representative of the State and that of the Union on questions of interpretation of the Constitution and law which may affect the welfare of the whole people and particularly that of the people of the State concerned, a suit under Article 131 of the Constitution lies.
