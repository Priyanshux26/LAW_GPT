20.3 The compliance affidavit of Respondent No.4 namely the Commissioner of BDA would indicate the steps taken by the said authorities to implement the namely issuance of notice dated 10.06.2024 and reply given thereto by the noticee and the purported joint mahazar having been drawn at the spot for taking possession of the subject land, nothing more turns around. 20.4 The compliance affidavit filed on behalf of the Respondent Nos.5 to 6 is in same line with the affidavit filed by the Respondent No.4. 20.5 We find from the afore-stated affidavits that the consistent stand taken by the State from day one till date is to the 1314 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports effect that: (i) petitioners were not entitled for the TDR; (ii) if at all they are entitled to, then they would be entitled to the compensation as per the Land Acquisition Act or the value of the land as fixed by the ULC authorities or the value of the land as determined by the authorities determining the wealth tax; (iii) even if value is to be determined and TDR is to be furnished the valuation of the land cannot be as per the value fixed for the adjacent lands under Section 45B of the Karnataka Stamp Act,1957 and the value is to be fixed as per the value of the land determined under the BPAT Act namely 11 crores for 472 acres and proportionately for 15 acres 39 guntas the value of the subject land has to be determined. 21. Having dragged its feet for years in implementing the s of this Court the respondents seem to have conceptualized a novel method to over-reach the s of this Court and we say so for the simple reason that affidavit of the compliance does not indicate or clearly admit that the TDR certificate being issued is in accordance with the extant TDR Rules but it is on an assumed value. The notice dated 10.06.2024 which was preceded by Government dated 24.05.2024 issued to the petitioners reflect that market value of the land acquired has been determined @ Rs.120.68/ per square meter inclusive of interest, which notice has also been duly replied to by the petitioners on 13.06.2024 contending valuation made is contrary to TDR Rules. The Government dated 24.05.2024 being contrary to the direction issued by this Court cannot be accepted or the value of the subject land as determined thereunder to be correct, or the value indicated therein can be taken as a determination as per TDR Rules and it is diametrically opposite to the TDR Rules. We say so for reasons more than one. Firstly, the gazette notification dated 27.09.2023 issued in exercise of power vested under Section 45B of Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957 by the Government of Karnataka fixing the guidance value of the properties for the purposes of registration which has been appended to the counter affidavit filed by the complainants would indicate that the value of the subject property is fixed at Rs.
