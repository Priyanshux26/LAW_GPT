Appellant concluded that it was a case of additional labelling and not relabelling. Therefore, such labelling at Taloja did not amount to manufacture. After holding that Rule 3 of the Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Cenvat Credit Rules’) allows cenvat credit only in a case where the process undertaken amounts to manufacture, respondent held that the process of labelling undertaken by the respondent in its unit at Taloja did not amount to manufacture. Therefore, the cenvat credit availed of by the respondent was contrary to Rule 3 of the Cenvat Credit Rules. Hence, the credit of Rs. 23,02,53,752.00 availed of by it was irregular which was liable to be recovered under Rule 14 of the Cenvat Credit Rules read with Section 11A(1) of the Central Excise Act. Further, appellant held that the respondent had already utilised part of the irregular credit availed of and claimed rebate of Rs. 13,22,30,368.00 during the period from June, 2008 to July, 2012. As the credit availed of was irregular, the rebate sanctioned was erroneous since the respondent was not entitled to take the credit and to utilize the same. Therefore, it was held 276 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports that the erroneous refund of Rs. 13,22,60,368.00 was liable to be recovered on which the respondent was also liable to pay interest under Section 11AB/Section 11AA of the Central Excise Act. Proceeding further, appellant held that respondent had suppressed the information from the department that it was only undertaking labelling activity at its Taloja unit which did not amount to manufacture. Thus, with the intention to avail irregular credit, respondent had suppressed the information and claimed that the process undertaken by its unit at Taloja amounted to manufacture. Therefore, there was suppression of material fact with the intent to avail irregular credit. Hence, the respondent was held liable to pay penalty equivalent to the irregular credit availed of under Rule 15(2) of the Cenvat Credit Rules read with Section 11AC of the Central Excise Act. Thereafter, appellant passed the following : 1. credit of Rs. 23,02,53,752.00 (Rupees twenty three crores two lakhs fifty three thousand seven hundred fifty two only) was wrongly availed and therefore demanded under provisions of Rule 14 of Cenvat Credit Rules read with Section 11A(4) (erstwhile Section 11A(1) of the Central Excise Act. 2. rebate of Rs. 13,22,30,368.00 (Rupees thirteen crores twenty two lakhs thirty thousand three hundred sixty eight only) sanctioned during the period from June 2008 to July 2012 was erroneous as the duty on the exported goods were paid by utilizing the regularly availed credit which was not eligible to the assessee. Hence, the same was demanded under Section 11A(1)/Section 11A(4) of Central Excise Act. 3. interest at the appropriate rate under Rule 14 of the Cenvat Credit Rules read with Section 11AA (erstwhile Section 11AB) of the Central Excise Act, was demanded on the irregular credit availed/erroneous rebate sanctioned. 4. penalty of Rs. 23,02,53,752.00 (Rupees twenty three crores two lakhs fifty three thousand seven hundred fifty two only) under the provisions of Rule 15(2) of Cenvat Credit Rules read with Section 11AC(1)(a) of the Central Excise Act was imposed.
