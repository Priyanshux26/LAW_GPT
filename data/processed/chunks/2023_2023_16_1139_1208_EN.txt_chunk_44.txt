The ILC Draft Conclusions further provide that a common understanding would be required, regarding the interpretation of a treaty which the parties are aware of and accept. Such an agreement may, but need not, be legally binding for it to be taken into account.72 Further, the number of parties that must actively engage in subsequent practice in to establish an agreement under Article 31(3)(b), may vary. Silence on the part of one or more parties may constitute acceptance of the subsequent practice when the circumstances call for some reaction.73 Agreement between the parties in respect of subsequent conduct or practice may be established by acquiescence of parties not actively participating in the practice, or the absence of objections (characterized as ‘passive conduct’).74 79. ILC commentaries, such as the ILC Draft Conclusions on subsequent practice, are an infl uential subsidiary means for determining rules of law, within the meaning of the term in Article 38(1)(d) of the ICJ Statute. This is because these documents often record and assess state practice (as well as international jurisprudence and doctrine), and often explain whether (and to what extent) opinio juris exists.75 As of 2019, the ICJ had relied expressly on the ILC’s work in 22 cases (19 decisions in contentious proceedings and 3 advisory opinions).76 80. The provisions of the ILC Draft Conclusions on subsequent practice were drafted and adopted by consolidating the writings of eminent publicists in international law, pursuant to extensive research on evolving state practice.77 The cumulative eff ect of these provisions is that state practice subsequent to the adoption of a treaty confi rms and solidifi es the intent of the parties to the 72 Conclusion 10(1), Id. 73 Conclusion 10(2), Id. 74 ILC, Third Report on the Law of Treaties, UN Doc A/CN.4/167, 59 para 24; See also ME Villiger, Commentary on the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (Brill, 2009), 431. 75 Danae Azaria, The International Law Commission’s Return to the Law of Sources of International Law, 13 FIU L.

The goal of treaty interpretation under the VCLT is to determine the meaning of the treaty viewed from the perspective of the contemporary shared understanding of the parties to the treaties.78 As James Crawford has pointed out, from the perspective of international law, ‘the parties…own the treaty’79. Bruno Simma further emphasizes the relevance of subsequent practice for the understanding of a treaty, noting that subsequent practice denotes the decisive consent of the parties, and acts as a cogent, peremptory means of treaty interpretation.80 81.
