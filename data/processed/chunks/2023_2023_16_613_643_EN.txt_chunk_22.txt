To that extent, these appeals succeed and are hereby allowed. 38. As we have not touched the fi ndings of the High Court on law and it was indeed the correct position of law, the remaining Civil Appeals No. 6237 of 2023, 6235 of 2023 and 6236 of 2023 (fi led by Meenakshi, Parvez and Ashitosh Thakur respectively) are hereby dismissed. 39. We also make it clear that the present litigation which the appellants have gone through will not come in way of these judicial offi cers in any manner, as far as their judicial career is concerned. They shall be treated at par with the other appointees on the post of Civil Judge (Junior Division) for that year. Pending applications, if any, are also disposed of.
