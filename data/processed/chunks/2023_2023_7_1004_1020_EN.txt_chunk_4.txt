15,94,06,500/- by treating the same as short term E capital gains and consequently, added the same to the income for the year under consideration. The Commissioner, IT (Appeals), Mumbai dismissed the appeal and confirmed the addition made by the AO and upheld the view of the AO to treat the transaction as income for capital gains for the AY 2009-10. The CIT (A) also discarded the submissions F made by the assessee that transfer of development rights were made in FY 2008-09 pursuant to the MOU dated 27.12.2007. In the absence of proof to buttress such claim, the CIT (A) also discarded the claim of the assessee that value of the transfer of development rights was reduced from Rs. 15,94,06,500/- to Rs. 5,24,27,354/- 2.2 The assessee filed an appeal before the ITAT. The ITAT, G after examining the chart submitted by the assessee pertaining to opening balance and closing balance for the assessment years 1996-97 to 2007- 08 held that the assessee in all these years showed inventory and expenses. Consequently, ITAT held that the assessee is engaged in the business of building and development. The ITAT further noted that the H 1010 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A assessee showed the cost of land along with related expenditure as work in progress/inventory since 1999-2000 and the assessment s were subsequently made under Section 143(3) of the IT Act, wherein the AO accepted the nature of business of the assessee. Therefore, ITAT concluded that what was sold by the assessee was part of its inventory and not a capital asset. The ITAT also held that the assessee has reduced B the sale consideration from Rs. 15,94,06,500/- to Rs. 5,24,27,354/- during FY 2007-08 on the basis of MOU dated 27.12.2007 and the said amount of the income has already been declared in the AY 2008-09 i.e., FY 2007-08 and therefore, such income cannot be declared in AY 2009-10 i.e., FY 2008-09. The ITAT also confirmed and/or agreed with the C assessee that the sale consideration was Rs. 5,24,27,354/- only. Based on these findings, the ITAT reversed the findings of the AO as well as the CIT (A) and allowed the appeal by deleting the addition made by the AO of Rs. 15,94,06,500/-. 2.3 The Revenue preferred an income tax appeal before the High D Court by way of ITA No. 1756/2014. By the impugned and , the High Court has dismissed the said appeal filed by the Revenue by holding that none of the questions proposed by the Revenue are substantial questions of law. 2.4 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned E and passed by the High Court dismissing the appeal, the Revenue has preferred the present appeal. 3. Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG has appeared on behalf of the Revenue and Shri S.K. Bagaria, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the assessee. F 4.
