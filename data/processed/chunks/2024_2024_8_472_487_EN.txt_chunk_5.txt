It is to avoid such situation that their pay deserves to be stepped up to the pay equal to their juniors. 24. Lastly, appellants relied on the following s to supplement weight to their arguments: i) Union of India & Ors. v. C.R. Madhava Murthy & Anr.,4 ii) Ashok Ram Parhad & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors.,5 iii) Gurcharan Singh Grewal v. Punjab SEB6 25. On the other hand, Respondents submitted that they are not disputing the fact that the appellants are senior to the ad hoc appointees [1984-95 Group] and the same position has also been accepted by the Single Bench as well as Division Bench of the High Court. It is submitted that despite the ad hoc appointees being juniors, Rule 21 is not applicable in the present case since the conditions stated in the said rule have not been fulfilled in the present case as the anomaly in pay is not a direct result of the application of the rule. That Clause (v) of Sub-rule (1) of Rule 21 clearly contemplates that if even in the lower post the junior Government employee draws from time to time the higher rate of pay than the senior by virtue of fixation of the pay under the normal rule or by grant of advance increments for any reasons, the same shall not be applicable to step up the pay of the senior Government employees. 26. Further, it was submitted that if the argument of the appellants that Rule 21 is applicable and consequently, their pay should be stepped up, is to be accepted, it would amount to giving benefit to the 4 [2022] 3 SCR 22 : (2002) 6 SCC 183 5 [2023] 2 SCR 900 : (2023) SCC Online SC 265 6 (2009) 3 SCC 94 480 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Petitioners and others of the earlier years, during which admittedly they were not even born in the cadre and not even serving, unlike the 1984-95 Group. 27. The Respondents relied upon the following s to stress that in similar facts and circumstances, this Court has held that rule of stepping up shall not be applicable: i) Union of India v. R. Swaminathan,7 ii) Union of India v. M. Suryanarayana Rao,8 iii) Union of India v. Sushil Kumar Paul,9 iv) ESI Corporation v. P.K. Srinivasmurthy,10 ISSUE AT HAND – 28. It is not in dispute that the appellants have not challenged the Resolutions dated 22.12.2014 and 10.08.2015, nor have they made 85 Assistant Professors [1984-95 Group] as party to the present proceedings. Therefore, it is clear that it is not the case of the appellants that the said 85 Assistant Professors have been wrongly granted the benefit, through the said resolutions. It is also not the case of the appellants that the said 85 Assistant Professors were not eligible for getting the said benefits. 29. Further, it is also an admitted fact that the appellants are seniors to the 1984-95 Group and is not under dispute.
