; (2) Is the challenged term substantively reasonable?” Id. at 1045 (quoting Allen v. Mich. Bell. Tel. Co., 18 Mich. App. 632, 637, 171 N.W.2d 689 (1969)). As to procedural unconscionability, the Court finds that this was a contract of adhesion. The terms of the contract were not negotiated and Plaintiff had relatively little economic strength in the transaction. LOMBARDI ENGINEERING LTD. v. UTTARAKHAND JAL 1025 VIDYUT NIGAM LTD. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] As to substantive unconscionability, the arbitration clause is unreasonable insofar as it requires Plaintiff to travel to Okaloosa County, Florida for the arbitration. In many circumstances requiring a consumer to travel a substantial distance to arbitrate a claim has been found to be unreasonable. DeOrnellas v. Aspen Square Mgmt., Inc., 295 F. Supp. 2d 753, 765-66 (E.D. Mich. 2003); Garrett v. Hooters-Toledo, 295 F. Supp. 2d 774, 783 (N.D. Ohio 2003); Comb v. PayPal, Inc., 218 F. Supp. 2d 1165, 1176-77 (N.D. Cal. 2002). In determining whether requiring the arbitration to be held in Florida is unreasonable, the Court must ask whether the “provision would deter a substantial number of similarly situated potential litigants. . . .”Morrison, 317 F.3d at 663. See Stutler, 448 F.3d at 346 (indicating that the test from Morrison is applicable “to the question of whether an arbitration clause is enforceable where federal statutorily provided rights are aff ected.”). Requiring a consumer who is experiencing fi nancial distress to travel to Florida would eff ectively deter such a consumer from pursuing arbitration. At the time the contract was signed Defendants knew that Plaintiff was experiencing fi nancial diffi culty and presumably knew that it would be diffi cult for Plaintiff to arbitrate in Florida. Given those circumstances, the Court fi nds that requiring Plaintiff to arbitrate in Florida would eff ectively bar Plaintiff from brining a claim and is substantively unreasonable. The Court fi nds that the provision in the arbitration clause that designates Okaloosa County, Florida as the site of the arbitration is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable under Michigan law. Therefore, the Court severs and declares unenforceable the provision in the arbitration clause that designates Okaloosa, Florida as the site of the arbitration.” 102. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we have reached to the conclusion that we should ignore the two conditions contained in Clause 55 of the GCC, one relating to 7% deposit of the total amount claimed and the second one relating to the stipulation empowering the Principal Secretary (Irrigation) Government of Uttarakhand to appoint a sole arbitrator. 102 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 103.
