518-19). These questions require examining underlying contractual theory (Rick Bigwood, “Antipodean Refl ections on the Canadian Unconscionability Doctrine” (2005) 84 Can. Bar Rev. 171, at p. 173). 56. The classic paradigm underlying freedom of contract is the “freely negotiated bargain or exchange” between “autonomous and self-interested parties” (McCamus, at p. 24; see also Swan, Adamski and Na, at pp. 922-23; P.S. Atiyah, Essays on Contract (1986), at p. 140). At the heart of this theory is the belief that contracting parties are best-placed to judge and protect their interests in the bargaining process (Atiyah, at pp. 146-48; Bigwood, at pp. 199-200; Alan Brudner, “Reconstructing contracts” (1993) 43 U.T.L.J. 1, at pp. 2-3). It also presumes equality between the contracting parties and that “the contract is negotiated, freely agreed, and therefore fair” (Mindy Chen- Wishart, Contract Law (6th ed. 2018), at p. 12) (emphasis in original). 57. In cases where these assumptions align with reality, the arguments for enforcing contracts carry their greatest weight (Melvin Aron Eisenberg, “The Bargain Principle and Its Limits” (1982) 95 Harv. L. Rev. 741, at pp. 746-48). But these arguments “may speak more or less forcefully depending on the context” (Wellman, at para. 53; see also B.J. Reiter, “Unconscionability : Is There a Choice? A Reply to Professor Hasson” (1980) 4 Can. Bus. L.J. 403, at pp. 405-6). As Professor Atiyah has noted: 101 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. The proposition that a person is always the best judge of his own interests is a good starting-point for laws and institutional arrangements, but as an infallible empirical proposition it is an outrage to human experience. The parallel moral argument, that to prevent a person, even in his own interests, from binding himself is to show disrespect for his moral autonomy, can ring very hollow when used to defend a grossly unfair contract secured at the expense of a person of little understanding or bargaining skill. [Emphasis added; p. 148] 58. Courts have never been required to take the ideal assumptions of contract theory as “infallible empirical proposition[s]”. Equitable doctrines have long allowed judges to “respond to the individual requirements of particular circumstances …. humaniz[ing] and contextualiz[ing] the law›s otherwise antiseptic nature” (Leonard I. Rotman, “The ‘Fusion’ of Law and Equity? : A Canadian Perspective on the Substantive, Jurisdictional, or Non-Fusion of Legal and Equitable Matters” (2016) 2 C.J.C.C.L. 497, at pp. 503-4). Courts, as a result, do not ignore serious fl aws in the contracting process that challenge the traditional paradigms of the common law of contract, such as faith in the capacity of the contracting parties to protect their own interests. The elderly person with cognitive impairment who sells assets for a fraction of their value (Ayres v. Hazelgrove, Q.B. England, February 9, 1984); the ship captain stranded at sea who pays an extortionate price for rescue (The Mark Lane, [L.R.] 15 P.D. 135); the vulnerable couple who signs an improvident mortgage with no understanding of its terms or fi nancial implications (Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd. v. Amadio, [1983] HCA 14 : 151 CLR 447) — these and similar scenarios bear little resemblance to the operative assumptions on which the classic contract model is constructed.
