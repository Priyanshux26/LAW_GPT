We however find that the High Court has failed to take into consideration the conduct 554 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the Borrower. It is further to be noted that, though the High Court had been specifically informed that, on account of subsequent developments, that is confirmation of sale and registration thereof, the position had reached an irreversible stage, the High Court has failed to take into consideration those aspects of the matter. 25. This Court, in the case of Valji Khimji and Company v. Official Liquidator of Hindustan Nitro Product (Gujarat) Limited and Others9, has observed thus: “30. In the first case mentioned above i.e. where the auction is not subject to confirmation by any authority, the auction is complete on the fall of the hammer, and certain rights accrue in favour of the auction-purchaser. However, where the auction is subject to subsequent confirmation by some authority (under a statute or terms of the auction) the auction is not complete and no rights accrue until the sale is confirmed by the said authority. Once, however, the sale is confirmed by that authority, certain rights accrue in favour of the auction-purchaser, and these rights cannot be extinguished except in exceptional cases such as fraud. 31. In the present case, the auction having been confirmed on 30-7-2003 by the Court it cannot be set aside unless some fraud or collusion has been proved. We are satisfied that no fraud or collusion has been established by anyone in this case.” 26. In our view, the High Court ought to have taken into consideration that the confirmed auction sale could have been interfered with only when there was a fraud or collusion. The present case was not a case of fraud or collusion. The effect of the of the High Court would be again reopening the issues which have achieved finality. 27. It is further to be noted that this Court, in the case of Dwarika Prasad v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others10, has clearly held that the right of redemption stands extinguished on the execution of the registered sale deed. In the present case, the sale was confirmed on 2nd November 2020 and registered on 11th November 2020. 9 [2008] 12 SCR 1 : (2008) 9 SCC 299 : 2008 INSC 925 10 [2018] 3 SCR 29 : (2018) 5 SCC 491 : 2018 INSC 210 [2024] 4 S.C.R. 555 PHR Invent Educational Society v. UCO Bank and Others 28. Insofar as the contention of the Borrower and its reliance on the of this Court in the case of Mohammad Nooh (supra) is concerned, no doubt that non-exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution on the ground of availability of an alternative remedy is a rule of self-restraint. There cannot be any doubt with that proposition. In this respect, it will be relevant to refer to the following observations of this Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax and Others v. Chhabil Dass Agarwal11: “15.
