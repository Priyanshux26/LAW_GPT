The trial Court had sentenced the appellant to death under Section 302 IPC, to simple imprisonment of 10 (ten) years and a fine of Rs.10,000/- for offence under Section 364 and to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000/- for offence under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. No separate sentences were awarded for offences punishable under Section 4 of the POCSO Act and Section 377 of IPC. The trial Court had directed that the accused should suffer all the above ed punishments together. The High Court had confirmed the death sentence and dismissed the appeal of the appellant. 41. In view of what we have held hereinabove, while maintaining the conviction under Sections 302, 364, 377 of IPC and Sections 4 and 6 of the POCSO Act, we set aside the sentence of death for the offence under Section 302 and substitute the same with that of rigorous imprisonment for a period of 25 (twenty-five) years without remission. We also that the sentence imposed for offences under Section 364 IPC (10 years S.I. and Rs. 10,000/- fine) and Section 6 of the POCSO Act (life imprisonment and Rs.10,000/- fine) shall run concurrently with the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for a period of 25 years without remission, which we have presently ed. 1092 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
