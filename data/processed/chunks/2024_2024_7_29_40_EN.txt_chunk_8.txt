32. The written statement of the Cantonment Board itself as filed in Title Suit No.8/64 (Exh.12) makes it abundantly clear that upon the establishment of the Cantonment Board as a temporary measure in the year 1941, the Raja on being approached permitted it on 06.11.1941 to use 2.55 acres of land consisting of the dispensary building and other structures along with adjoining land to be used by the Cantonment Board for a period of six months which was extended up to 31.12.1943. There was no other settlement of any land in favour of the Cantonment Board and the Cantonment Board was in permissive possession of only 2.55 acres of land out of the 40 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 5.38 acres of the entire land of village Ramgarh. The land settled in favour of the plaintiff-appellant and that in favour of the Cantonment Board by the Raja were distinct and as such there was no apparent conflict between them. 33. The plaintiff-appellant by sufficient evidence has proved the settlement of the suit land by the Raja in his favour. It stands proved by the Amin report (Exh.8) dated 15.04.1942 and the Hukumnama (Exh.9) dated 07.04.1943 as well as the Rent receipt (Exh.6, 6/A and 7). The of the Additional Collector, Hazaribagh dated 07.01.1963 (Exh.16) directing realization of rent from the plaintiff-appellant also confirms the above settlement and its subsequent approval by the State on enhancement of rent. All these documents have not been confronted by the other side. The fact that the name of the plaintiff-appellant was also mutated in the revenue records proves it beyond doubt, in the absence of any contrary evidence that he is in possession of the suit land. It may also be worth noting that in the earlier suit, the Cantonment Board has accepted that the plaintiff-appellant has been realizing rent of the shops existing over the suit land from the tenants. 34. In view of the aforesaid overwhelming unconfronted evidence, the First Appellate Court manifestly erred in reversing the finding of the court of first instance that the plaintiff-appellant is in settled possession of the suit land and he has successfully proved his ownership rights over the same. 35. Accordingly, the and of the High Court dated 01.04.2009 and that of the First Appellate Court dated 28.06.2006 are hereby set aside and the and dated 16.03.2000 passed by the trial court is restored decreeing the title suit of the plaintiff-appellant but with no as to costs. 36. The appeal is allowed. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
