[Paras 2.1, 13, 14, 17, 32, 35] Administrative Law – Subordinate legislation – Operation of – Prospective/retrospective – Principles governing - Discussed. Madhya Pradesh General Clauses Act, 1957 – s.10 – Effect of Repeal – M.P. Excise Act, 1915 – Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 1996 – r.19 – General Clauses Act, 1897 – s.6 – Violation occurred during the license period of 2009-10 – r.19 substituted in 2011 imposed lesser penalty than the repealed r.19 if permissible limits of loss of liquor exceeded – Demand notice issued in 2011 – Payment of penalty, if to be as per the repealed r.19 or the substituted r.19 – Plea of the respondent that as s.10 states that where any Madhya Pradesh Act repeals any enactment then, unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability, acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed; State of M.P. can continue to apply the repealed Rule for the transaction of 2009-2010 by virtue of specific provisions under the 1957 Act: Held: s.10 of the MP General Clauses Act by itself would not make any difference as the Section is applicable only to enactments, i.e. when any M.P. Act repeals any enactment and not a subordinate legislation – Interpreting s.6, an identical provision of the General Clauses Act, 1897, this Court has consistently held that s.6 of the 1897 Act, has no application to subordinate legislation – Further, the subject of administration of liquor requires close monitoring and the amendment must be seen in this context of bringing about good governance and effective management – Seen in this context, the principle of s.10 of 666 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 1957 Act, relating continuation of a repealed provision to rights and liabilities that accrued during the subsistence of the Rule does not subserve the purpose and object of the amendment. [Paras 31, 32] Administrative law – Subordinate legislation – Rule making and its enforcement – Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 1996 – r.19: Held: The process of identifying a crime and prescribing an appropriate punishment is a complex and delicate subject that the State has to handle while making rules and enforcing them – The gravity of the offence, its impact on society and human vulnerability are taken into account to provide the required measure of deterrence and reform – Day to day working of the Rules, reposing their effectiveness, ineffectiveness, deficiency of deterrence, disproportionate penalty having a chilling effect on genuine businesses, are some routine factors which require the executive to make necessary amendments to the rules – In this context, depending on the nature of offence, the proportionate penalty is required to be modulated from time to time – In the present case, the regulatory process required the Government to deal with the problem of diversion and unlawful sale of foreign liquor and also provide an appropriate penalty and punishment – In light of this, the felt need of the State to amend and substitute r.19 which provided a higher penalty at four times the duty, with a simple penalty not exceeding the duty payable can be appreciated.
