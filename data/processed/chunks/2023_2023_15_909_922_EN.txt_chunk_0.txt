[2023] 15 S.C.R. 909 : 2023 INSC 1081 CASE DETAILS SUSHMA SHIVKUMAR DAGA & ANR. v. MADHURKUMAR RAMKRISHNAJI BAJAJ & ORS (Civil Appeal No. 1854 of 2023) DECEMBER 15, 2023 [ANIRUDDHA BOSE AND SUDHANSHU DHULIA, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: The trial Court referred the matter to arbitration and the said decision was upheld by the High Court. Whether the Trial Court and the High Court have rightly referred the matter to arbitration or the dispute is of such a nature that it is not liable to be referred to arbitration, as there was no arbitration clause in the Conveyance Deed dated 17.12.2019 or if there was, yet the matter in any case is such that it is not arbitrable. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – A civil suit was fi led by the appellants-plaintiff s herein seeking declaration that the conveyance deed dated 17.12.2019 was validly terminated and various other registered development agreements dated 17.09.2007, 20.11.2007, 30.11.2007, 03.12.2007 and 27.02.2008 were null and void – Respondent-defendants fi led application u/s.8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – Matter was referred to arbitration – Propriety: Held: In the instant case, there are broadly three objections of the appellants: The fi rst objection was regarding the absence of arbitration clause in the conveyance deed and the various development agreements – The Conveyance deed dated 17.12.2019 and the fi ve development agreements dated 17.09.2007, 20.11.2007, 30.11.2007, 03.12.2007 and 27.02.2008, all fi nd their source in the two Tripartite agreements dated 31.03.2007 and 25.07.2008 – Both the Tripartite agreements contained the arbitration clause – The Trial Court and the High Court have rightly held that the broad language of the ‘arbitration clause’ in the two Tripartite agreements would cover the dispute raised by the appellants before the Civil Court 909 910 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. and hence rightly referred to arbitration – The second objection was that the suit fi led by the appellants is for cancellation of a document relating to immovable property i.e. land and it therefore amounts to an action in rem and hence arbitration is not the remedy – It is settled that whether it is a suit for cancellation of a deed or a declaration of rights rising from deed, it would only be an action in personam and not in rem – The third objection was regarding fraud – The plea of fraud raised by the appellants in their objection to the Section 8 application was never substantiated – Except for making a bald allegation of fraud there is nothing else – This Court has consistently held that a plea of fraud must be serious in nature in to oust the jurisdiction of an Arbitrator – Both the trial Court and the High Court have given a correct fi nding on facts as well as law – No interference required.
