13. The object of S. 109A(3) of the Companies Act, 1956, according to the Division Bench, is not materially diff erent from S. 6(1) of the Government Savings Certifi cates Act, 1959 and S. 109B of the Companies Act, 1956 is likewise similar to S. 45-ZA(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The law relating to S. 6(1) of the Government Savings Certifi cates Act, 1959 has already been settled in the case of N. Khanchandani (supra) where the Supreme Court upheld the law declared in Sarbati Devi (supra). SHAKTI YEZDANI & ANR. v. JAYANAND JAYANT 705 SALGAONKAR & ORS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] 14. Looking at the provisions relating to nominations under diff erent statutory enactments and the way the courts have interpreted those to the eff ect that the nominee does not get absolute title to the property which is the subject matter of nomination, the Division Bench interpreting the provisions under S. 109A & S. 109B Companies Act, 1956 declared that they do not override the law in relation to testamentary or intestate succession. The in Kokate (supra) was declared to be incorrect as it failed to consider the law laid down in Khanchandani (supra) and Talwar (supra) as these cases preceded Kokate (supra). ARGUMENTS 15. The learned counsels for the appellants and the respondents put forth the following arguments for consideration: 15.1 Mr. Abhimanyu Bhandari, the learned counsel for the appellants argues that the scheme of nomination as provided in the Companies Act, 1956 is not analogous to nomination as provided under other legislations. Unlike in other legislations, the term ‘vesting’ & ‘to the exclusion of others’ along with a ‘non-obstante clause’ are placed together in the Companies Act, 1956. Therefore, it would be incorrect to rely on the ratio of the s pertaining to other legislations (such as the Insurance Act, 1939, Banking Regulation Act, 1949, National Savings Certifi cates Act, 1959, Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952) to then interpret the provisions of S. 109A & S. 109B of the Companies Act, 1956. Provisions pertaining to the same in other legislations cannot be the basis for interpretation of the term ‘nomination’ under the Companies Act as those are not pari materia with S. 109A & S. 109B (now S. 72 of the Companies Act, 2013) of the Companies Act, 1956. 15.2 It is contended that S. 109A & S. 109B (now S. 72 of the Companies Act, 2013) introduced in the Companies Act, 1956 by the legislature on 31.08.1988 with the language so used makes it clear that a nominee, upon the death of the shareholder/debenture holder, will secure full and exclusive ownership rights in respect of the shares/debentures for which he/she is the nominee. In fact, adverting to the hierarchy laid down under the provision, shareholding in an individual capacity (S. 109A(1)), then a joint shareholder owning the shares jointly (S. 109A(2)) and then fi nally, a nominee (S. 109A(3)) in whom the shares shall vest in the event of death 706 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R.
