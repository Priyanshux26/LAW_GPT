Any other reading of Section 28 would render the provisions of Section 2(34) of the Act otiose inasmuch as the test contemplated under Section 2(34) of the Act is that of specific conferment of such functions.” 23. We, therefore, hold that the entire proceeding in the present case initiated by the Additional Director General of the DRI by issuing show cause notices in all the matters before us are invalid without any authority of law and liable to be set aside and the ensuing demands are also set aside.” [2024] 12 S.C.R. 265 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. 73. It is not in dispute that Canon India (supra) is based on the decision of this Court in Sayed Ali (supra). We say so because in Canon India (supra), the petitioner had not questioned the jurisdiction of the officers of DRI either before the departmental authorities or before the Tribunal. We must, therefore, first look into the rendered in Sayed Ali (supra). ii. The decision in Commissioner of Customs v. Sayed Ali 74. In Sayed Ali (supra), a show cause notice dated 28.08.1991 was issued by the Assistant Collector of Customs (Preventive), Mumbai, alleging a violation of the provisions of Section 111(d) of the Act, 1962. It culminated in an dated 03.02.1993 which was appealed before the Collector of Customs (Appeals). An was passed by the Collector of Customs (Appeals) on 14.12.1993. The Collector of Customs (Appeals) allowed the appeal by holding that the matter involved demand of duty beyond a period of six months and therefore the show cause notice could have been issued only by the Collector and not by the Assistant Collector of Customs (Preventive). At that point of time, there were circulars of the Board, which stipulated pecuniary limits for officers to exercise powers under various provisions of the Act. Thus, the Collector (Appeals) granted liberty to the department to re-adjudicate the case by issuing a proper show cause notice. 75. The Collector of Customs (Preventive) thus issued a show cause notice dated 16.04.1994, calling upon the importer to show cause as to why the goods seized should not be confiscated, why the customs duty amounting to Rs.5,07,274/- should not be levied in terms of Section 28(1) of the Act, 1962, by invoking the extended period of limitation, and why the penalties under Sections 112(a) and (b)(i) and (ii) of the Act, 1962, should not be imposed on the said importer. 76. The jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs (Preventive) to issue the show cause notice was questioned in the reply to the show cause notice by referring to Notification No. 251/83 and Notification No.250/83. The Collector of Customs (Preventive) rejected the submission on the point of jurisdiction. The demand was thus affirmed by the Collector of Customs (Preventive) vide dated 19.08.1996. 266 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The matter was taken up before the Tribunal, which held that the Commissioner of Customs (Preventive) had no jurisdiction to issue the show cause notice and therefore did not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter when the imports had taken place within the Bombay Customs House.
