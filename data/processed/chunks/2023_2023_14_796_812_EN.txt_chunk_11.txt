With utmost respect to the High Court, we are constrained to observe that the question framed by it could be regarded as one of law, if it all, but did not merit the label of a substantial question of law so as to warrant interference with the fi rst appellate decree under section 100 of the CPC. 29. That apart, the High Court was remiss in reversing the fi ndings of facts rightly arrived at by the fi rst appellate court. The decision to adopt the Trial Court’s approach of interpreting the Commissioner’s within the framework of the revenue records that were exhibited was yet another aspect in which the High Court fell in error. An attempt ought to have been made by the High Court to harmoniously read the Commissioner’s with the provisions of the Act and to interpret the same so as to render it in consonance with the law, the failure of which leads to the inescapable conclusion that the same is indefensible. 30. The sequitur of this discussion, with respect, is that the High Court while rendering the and under challenge proceeded on an erroneous approach and contrary to settled law. The plaintiff having failed to meet the burden of proof imposed on him by law, his suit against the defendant must fail. 31.The impugned and decree are, accordingly, set aside. The civil appeal stands allowed and the decree passed by the Trial Court, extracted hereinabove, is set aside with the result that the plaintiff ’s suit shall stand dismissed. There shall be no as to costs. 32. We, however, make it clear that any observation made in this may not prejudice the plaintiff ’s right, if any, in respect of ‘A’ schedule property; if in future his right is put to jeopardy and the appropriate forum is approached to protect such right, such forum shall proceed to decide the lis on its own merits.
