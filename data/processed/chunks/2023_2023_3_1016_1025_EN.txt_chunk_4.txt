45,00,000/- per acre with respect to the land acquired vide notification dated 5.3.2007. 3.5 It is submitted that considering the time gap of approximately one year and nine months and granting 8 to 12 percent cumulative increase E on the compensation awarded for the land acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005, the compensation awarded by the High Court @ Rs. 45,00,000/- per acre is too excessive and can be said to be on much higher side. 3.6 It is submitted that as such for the land acquired vide F notification dated 13.08.2004 of the very villages Badh Malik and Pritampura, the High Court earlier determined and awarded compensation @ 21,00,000/- per acre and therefore considering the time gap of approximately two and half years and granting 8 to 12 percent increase, the amount awarded by the High Court at Rs. 45,00,000/- per acre is unsustainable. G 4. All these appeals are vehemently opposed by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original claimants/landowners. 4.1 Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original landowners have vehemently submitted that in fact while determining the compensation for the land acquired under both the notifications, the High H 1022 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A Court has not considered the other sale deeds except Ex. P43 & P44. It is submitted that if other sale deeds would have been considered and the development in the surrounding areas would have been considered, the amount of compensation awarded by the High Court can be said to be on the lower side. It is submitted that as it is a case of compulsory acquisition, the landowners are entitled to the just compensation on the B basis of the fair market value. Reliance is placed on the decisions of this Court in the cases of General Manager, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited v. Rameshbhai Jivanbhai Patel and Another, reported in (2008) 14 SCC 745 (paras 13 & 14); Mehrawal Khewaji Trust (Registered), Faridkot and others v. State of Punjab and others, C reported in (2012) 5 SCC 432 (para 17). 4.2 Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original landowners have relied upon the sale deeds produced as Ex. P4, P3, P6, P7 & P5 of village Badh Malik and Badh Khalsa in support of their submission that in October 2005 and in the year 2006, the market value of the land was much much higher. D 4.3 Making above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeals. 5. We have heard learned counsel for the respective parties at length. E We have gone through the impugned common and passed by the High Court in detail and have also considered the reasoning given by the High Court by assessing and determining the compensation @ Rs. 29,54,000/- per acre for the land acquired vide notification dated 30.06.2005 and at Rs. 45,00,000/- per acre for the land acquired vide notification dated 5.3.2007. F 5.1 At the outset, it is required to be noted that in the present case the lands were acquired of villages Badh Malik, Pritampura and Rasoi in District Sonipat, Haryana, which were all agricultural lands and acquired for the purpose of industrial sector 39, Sonipat.
