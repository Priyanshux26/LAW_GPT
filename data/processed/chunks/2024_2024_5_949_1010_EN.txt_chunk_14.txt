Hon’ble Arun Mishra, Hon’ble Vineet Saran and Hon’ble M.R. Shah, JJ.) allowed several applications, thereby recalling the in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra). 14. What is, therefore, laid bare by these facts is that firstly, Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) was doubted in Shailendra [2-Judge] (supra), whereafter it was declared per incuriam 9 [2019] 15 SCR 1085 : (2020) 6 SCC 304 10 (2020) 6 SCC 304, Para 45 11 2020 SCC OnLine SC 1471 968 [2024] 5 S.C.R.

D. FACTS GIVING RISE TO THE REVIEW PETITIONS 15. Immediately after Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) was decided, several writ petitions came to be instituted not only in the High Court but also in different high courts across the country seeking similar declaration, viz. owing to the requisite conditions mentioned in Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act being met, land acquisition proceedings initiated under the 1894 Act stood lapsed. These RPs arise out of writ proceedings on the file of the High Court, which have since attained finality by reason of the s and s under review. 16. The facts are noticed from the Review Petition arising out of the Writ Petition12 instituted by the first respondent, K.L. Rathi Steels Limited, which is the lead matter. Relying upon the decision of this Court in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and similar line of decisions, the High Court vide its and dated 7th July, 2015, allowed the writ petition taking a view that the necessary ingredients of section 24(2), as interpreted by this Court, having been met, the acquisition proceedings under challenge therein are deemed to have lapsed. Aggrieved, the first respondent carried such and in a Civil Appeal13 praying for it to be set aside. This Court, vide a common and dated 29th November, 2016 concerning various civil appeals, dismissed the appeals and granted a period of one year to the appellants (review petitioners herein) to exercise liberty granted under section 24(2) of the 2013 Act for initiation of acquisition proceedings afresh. 17. Availing what they call is a ‘liberty’ granted by this Court in Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra), the appellants in the Civil Appeal (review petitioners herein) approached this Court seeking a review of the aforesaid and dated 29th November, 2016. Although the review petition suffered from substantial delay, the same stood condoned by the said Division Bench after the split verdict. 12 W.P. (C) No. 9200/2014 13 Civil Appeal No. 11857/2016 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 969 Govt. of NCT of Delhi Through Its Secretary, Land and Building Department & Another v. M/s K.L. Rathi Steels Limited and Others 18. It is relevant to mention at this stage that during the entire period of controversy, the observation in paragraph 217 of Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra) was construed as ‘liberty’ by not only the appellants in the Civil Appeal but also by other similarly placed appellants/ special leave petitioners leading them to approach this Court seeking review of all those decisions whereby, relying upon Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and similar line of cases, it was declared that land acquisition proceedings were deemed to have lapsed under section 24(2) of the 2013 Act.
