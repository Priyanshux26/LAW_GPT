It is therefore, clear that the date on which the relief of rate of taxation for interest and dividends was specifi ed to be 01.04.1997; diff erent dates (01.04.1995 and 01.04.1998) were applied as applicable to the defi nition of fees and technical services and other details; the rates, too varied, depending on the period(s). The second aspect, is that the notifi cation under Section 90 was issued on 30.08.1999. The third, and most signifi cant aspect is that the favourable or benefi cial treatment was given to other OECD nations on 26.10.1996 (India-Germany); the DTAA between India and Sweden entered into force on 25.12.1997, the India-Swiss Confederation DTAA entered into force on 19.10.1994 itself. These earlier dates, did not ASSESSING OFFICER CIRCLE (INTERNATIONAL TAXATION) 2(2)(2) 1183 NEW DELHI v. M/S NESTLE SA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] result in India automatically extending benefi ts of Article IV of the India- Netherlands DTAA Protocol to Netherlands. The relevant phrase in that provision (Article IV) obliged India to grant to the Netherlands, the same benefi t to it, as was granted to the other nation in that third party state’s DTAA or Protocol with India: “as from the date on which the relevant Indian Convention or Agreement enters into force the same rate or scope as provided for in that Convention or Agreement on the said items of income shall also. apply under this Convention” 55. Clearly, therefore, so far as India-Netherlands DTAA goes, there is established and clear precedent, of behaviour, in relation to treaty practise and interpretation. This was uncontested, and is a matter of record. 56. In relation to France, the India-France DTAA and Protocol came into force on 01.08.1994, after the notifi cation by the contracting states to each other of the completion of the procedures required under their laws to bring them into force. Article 7 of that DTAA (which dealt with principles of taxation of Business profi ts), provided by Article 7(3)(a) that: “Provided that where the law of the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated imposes a restriction on the amount of the executive and general administrative expenses which may be allowed, and that restriction is relaxed or overridden by any Convention, Agreement or Protocol signed after 1-1-1990 between that Contracting State and a third State which is a member of the OECD, the competent authority of that Contracting State shall notify the competent authority of the other Contracting State of the terms of the corresponding paragraph in the Convention, Agreement or Protocol with that third State immediately after the entry into force of that Convention, Agreement or Protocol and, if the competent authority of the other Contracting State so requests, the provisions of that paragraph shall apply under this Convention from that entry into force.” 57. The DTAA between India and USA had been entered into force, on 18.12.1990; the DTAA between India and Germany had been entered into on 26.10.1996. These DTAAs gave benefi ts or more favourable treatment 118 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R.
