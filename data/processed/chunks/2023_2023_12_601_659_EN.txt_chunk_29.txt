58 of the Telangana Land Revenue Act. Point No. 1 is answered accordingly.” (Emphasis Applied) 57. The abovementioned decision thus envisages the application of Section 58-A of the 1317 Fasli Act only in cases where the assignment is within the ambit of Section 54 of the 1317 Fasli Act. In other words, Assignments such as those under Section 58 of the 1317 Fasli Act are free from the rigours specifi ed under Section 58-A of the 1317 Fasli Act. It goes without saying that the assignment of the Subject Land was not under Section 54 of the 1317 Fasli Act as may be seen from the contents of the 1958 Circular which draws a clear distinction between- (a) Land assigned on payment of market value after making an application to the Collector 22 Letter sent from Plot No.338 (n 6). YADAIAH AND ANR. v. STATE OF TELANGANA AND 643 OTHERS [SURYA KANT, J.] and (b) Land Assigned to the Landless poor persons. The former is the case of assignment under Section 54 of the 1317 Fasli Act and the latter is covered within the ambit of Section 58 of the 1317 Fasli Act. The instant case unambiguously falls in the latter category, i.e. ‘Land Assigned to the Landless poor persons’. 58. Additionally, Section 58 of the 1317 Fasli Act is a deeming provision wherein an occupancy right is presumed to be heritable as well as transferable, until an indication to the contrary is proved. In this regard, 1958 Circular issued in exercise of the rule-making power vested under Section 172 of 1317 Fasli Act, read with an independent statutory bar created under Section 3 of the 1977 Act, portrays an explicit legislative intention to curtail the legal fi ction created under Section 58 of the 1317 Fasli Act. This is the precise reason because of which the decision in Letter sent from Plot No.33823 concludes that 1977 Act was applicable in respect of the land assigned to landless individuals and the same was governed by the conditions of non-alienability as incorporated in the 1958 Circular. The precise part of the decision in Letter sent from Plot No.33824 as relied upon by the Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned decision, states that:– “60. We are of the view that provisions of Act No. 9 of 1977 will not be applicable to the cases where assignments were made on collection of market value or under Circular 14 except it were granted to the landless poor persons free of market value. Point No. 2 is answered accordingly.” 59. We have, therefore, no doubt in our mind that the Subject Land was governed by the provision of the 1958 Circular which included the condition of non-alienability. We, however, clarify that since the Laoni Rules of 1950 were inapplicable on the Subject Land, the contention raised by Mr. Ray regarding violation of Article 14 in respect of ‘regular assignment’ and ‘special laoni assignment’ becomes irrelevant and out of context and the same need not be gone into by us.
