[Paras 7 and 8] Practice and Procedure – Procedure to be adopted by High Courts while passing interim of stay of proceedings and for dealing with the applications for vacating interim stay: Held: (Per Abhay S. Oka, J. for himself and Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, CJI., J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, JJ.) To avoid any prejudice to the opposite parties, while granting ex-parte ad- interim relief without hearing the affected parties, the High Courts should normally grant ad-interim relief for a limited duration – After hearing the contesting parties, the Court may or may not confirm the earlier ad-interim – Ad-interim relief, once granted, can be vacated or affirmed only after application of mind by the concerned Court – Hence, the Courts must give necessary priority to the hearing of the prayer for interim relief where adinterim relief has been granted – Though the High Court is not expected to record detailed reasons while dealing with the prayer for the grant of stay or interim relief, the must give sufficient indication of the application of mind to the relevant factors – An interim passed after hearing the contesting parties cannot be vacated by the High Court without giving sufficient opportunity of being heard to the party whose prayer for interim relief has been granted – Even if interim relief is granted after hearing both sides, as observed earlier, the aggrieved party is not precluded from applying for vacating the same on the available grounds – In such a case, the High Court must give necessary priority to the hearing of applications for vacating the stay, if the main case cannot be immediately taken up for hearing – Applications for vacating interim reliefs cannot be kept pending for an inordinately long time.
