Note: Pagination as per the original . [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1233 Delhi Development Authority v. Tejpal & Ors. For the reasons assigned in Part E of this Judgement, we grant leave in all these Special Leave Petitions, except those mentioned in ‘List-B’, ‘List-D.2’ and ‘List-E.1’ (infra). 2. These appeals have been preferred by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), Government of National Capital of Delhi (GNCTD), Land Acquisition Collector (LAC), Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC), East Delhi Municipal Corporation, and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (DMRC) (collectively, the “appellants”), against various identical s of the High Court of Delhi, whereby acquisition proceedings had been declared to have lapsed in terms of Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter, the “2013 Act”). Multiple Review Petitions and Miscellaneous Applications have also been moved by the DDA seeking recall and review of certain s of this Court dismissing their SLPs, whereby some of the land acquisition proceedings were declared to have lapsed. 3. While the factual matrix giving rise to the present controversy has been elaborated in a judgement of the even date passed by us in the matter of GNCTD (through Secretary, Land and Building Dept.) v. KL Rathi Steels Ltd.,1 a very brief overview of the relevant facts has been set out below. A. Facts 3.1. The GNCTD initiated the land acquisition process under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter, “1894 Act”) for the planned development of Delhi. The beneficiaries of such acquisition process were various state entities such as DDA, DSIIDC, and DMRC, who needed the lands for different projects like residential schemes, industrial areas, flyovers, the Delhi Metro, etc. Accordingly, over a long span of 1957-2006, various notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of the 1894 Act were issued for acquiring these lands and awards were passed under Section 11 of the 1894 Act affixing compensation. 3.2. In some cases, the compensation amount was deposited in the treasury since the landowners did not come forward to 1 MA No. 414/2023. 1234 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports receive the same. Similarly, possession could not be taken in some cases as the affected landowners had challenged the acquisition proceedings and had obtained an of stay in their favour.
