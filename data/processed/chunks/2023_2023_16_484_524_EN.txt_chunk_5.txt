Thus, it was held to be a colourable device to reduce taxable income. On such an assumption, the assessee was asked to explain its claim of deduction under Section 80 IA of the Act which the assessee complied with. 7.3. Response of the assessee was considered by the assessing offi cer. By the assessment dated 26.03.2004 passed under Section 143 (3) of the Act, the assessing offi cer held that Rs.3.72 claimed by the assessee as the rate at which power was supplied by it to its own industrial units was not the true market value.According to the assessing offi cer, the rate of Rs.2.32 per unit agreed upon between the assessee and the State Electricity Board and at which rate surplus electricity was supplied by the assessee to the State Electricity Board was the market value of electricity. Therefore, for the purpose of computing the profi t of the power generating units, the selling rate of power per unit was taken at Rs.2.32. On that basis, assessing offi cer held that there was an excessive claim of deduction of Rs.1.40 per unit on captive consumption (Rs.3.72 - Rs.2.32), following which the assessing offi cer worked out the excess deduction claimed by the assessee under Section 80 IA at Rs.31,98,66,505.00. Therefore, the assessing offi cer restricted the claim of deduction of the assessee under Section 80 IA at Rs.48,11,72,000.00 (Rs.80,10,38,505.00 – Rs.31,98,66,505.00). 8. Aggrieved by the aforesaid reduction in the claim of deduction under Section 80 IA of the Act, the assessee preferred appeal before the fi rst appellate authority i.e. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), Rohtak (referred to hereinafter as ‘CIT (A)’).By the appellate dated 16.05.2005, CIT (A) held that the action of the assessing offi cer in restricting deduction under Section 80 IA in respect of 22,84,76,505 units by Rs.1.40 per unit (Rs.3.72 – Rs.2.32) was justifi ed and hence confi rmed the reduction of deduction under Section 80 IA. 9. Assailing the of CIT (A), assessee preferred further appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench – I, Delhi (briefl y ‘the Tribunal’ hereinafter) which was registered as ITA No.3485/Delhi/05 492 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. for the assessment year 2001-02. We may also mention that revenue had fi led a cross appeal arising out of the same before the Tribunal but on a diff erent issue which may not be necessary to be gone into for the purpose of the present appeal. The grievance of the assessee before the Tribunal in its appeal was against the action of CIT (A) in affi rming the reduction of deduction under Section 80 IA of the Act made by the assessing offi cer at Rs.48,11,72,000.00 as against Rs.80,10,38,505.00claimed by the assessee. 9.1. In its dated 07.06.2007, Tribunal noted that the dispute between the parties related to the manner of computing profi ts of the undertaking of the assessee engaged in the business of generation of power for the purpose of relief under Section 80 IA of the Act.
