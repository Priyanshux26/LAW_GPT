It was submitted that the learned Single Judge has rightly held so, and the Division Bench has gone only by the text of the dated 30.03.2013 to erroneously hold that the same was “simpliciter ”. 15. It was contended that the rules stipulate that the minimum tenure of service of a contractual appointee will be at least one year in the first instance and two years each subsequently, subject to evaluation of work in the first year whereas in the present case, the appellant had put in only 5 months and 15 days. Further, it was submitted that the curtailment of the tenure of the appellant was in violation of the provisions of the rules of the Rajiv Gandhi Prathmik Shiksha Mission2 (hereinafter referred to as “RGPSM”) which provide that for persons working on contract, notice of one month is to be served, if their tenure is to be curtailed on the ground of inefficiency. Moreover, learned counsel submitted that the respondents were further bound by s dated 09.03.2012 and 13.03.2012 issued by the Respondent No.2, which specifically provide that contractual workers in the SSA could not be terminated on the ground of inefficiency without affording them an opportunity of being heard, in accordance with the principles of natural justice. 2 Erstwhile name of the SSA. 908 [2024] 8 S.C.R.

Learned counsel submitted that this discloses that the respondents made an ex-post-facto justification for removing her and that during those 5/6 days, no incident had occurred, which may have justified such extreme action against the appellant. 18. Further, the stand of the learned counsel was that under the RGPSM, the Appointing Authority for the post of APC is the State Level Appointing Authority, whereas she had been removed by the District Level Committee, in contravention of Article 311(2)3 of the Constitution. 19. In support of his contentions, Mr. Bhushan relied upon the following decisions of this Court: 1. Anoop Jaiswal v Government of India (1984) 2 SCC 369 2. Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd. v Mazdoor Sabha (1980) 2 SCC 593 3. State Bank of India v Palak Modi (2013) 3 SCC 607 RESPONDENTS’ SUBMISSIONS: 20.
