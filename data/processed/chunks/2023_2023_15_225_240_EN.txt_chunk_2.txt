This Court while allowing the said Appeals vide the impugned dated 06.09.2022 held as under: “56. Section 48 of the GVAT Act is not contrary to or inconsistent with Section 53 or any other provisions of the IBC. Under Section 53(l) (b)(ii), the debts owed to a secured creditor, which would include the State under the GVAT Act. are to rank equally with other specifi ed debts including debts on account of workman’s dues for a period of 24 months preceding the liquidation commencement date. 57. As observed above, the State is a secured creditor under the GVAT Act. Section 3(30) of the IBC defi nes secured creditor to mean a creditor in favour of whom security interest is credited. Such security interest could be created by operation of law. The defi nition of secured creditor in the IBC does not exclude any Government or Governmental Authority. 58. We are constrained to hold that the Appellate Authority (NCLAT) and the Adjudicating Authority erred in law in rejecting the application/ appeal of the appellant. As observed above, delay in fi ling a claim cannot be the sole ground for rejecting the claim.
