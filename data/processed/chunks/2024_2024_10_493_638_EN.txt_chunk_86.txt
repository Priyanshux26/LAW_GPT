It has been submitted that the Ministry of Home Affairs may be directed to incorporate and reform the Model Prison Manual, 2016, to address the highlighted issues. 200. The Model Prison Manual 2016 was prepared “to reflect the understanding behind constitutional provisions, Supreme Court directions on prison administration and international instruments”.257 It covers a range of aspects relating to prisons, including institutional framework, custodial management, medical care, education and 257 Model Prison Manual 2016, p. 4, https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/PrisonManual2016.pdf 620 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports training of prisoners, maintenance of prisoners, emergency situations, remission, parole, premature releases and inspection of prisons, among other things. The Model Prison Manual 2016 also focuses on “prison computerization, special provisions for women prisoners, focus on after care services, rights of prisoners sentenced to death, repatriation of prisoners from abroad, enhanced focus on prison correctional staff”.258 New chapters on legal aid and inspection of prisons have been incorporated. 201. The Model Prison Manual 2016 suffers from several lacunae. The first issue to be noted with reference to the Manual is its classification of “habitual offenders”. The Manual defines “habitual offender” as “a prisoner classified as such in accordance with the provisions of applicable law or rules”.259 “Casual prisoner” is defined as “a prisoner other than a habitual offender”.260 The Manual provides for “the setting up of separate institutional facilities for different categories of prisoners”, including “maximum security prisons/ annexes/yards for high-risk prisoners and hardened or habitual offenders”.261 The Manual mandates the classification of undertrial prisoners in three categories, wherein habitual offenders are tagged along with “Gangsters, hired Assassins, dacoits, serial killers/rapists/ violent robbers, drug offenders, communal fanatics and those highly prone to escapes/ previous escapees/attack on police and other dangerous offenders/including those prone to self-harm/posing threat to public ”.262 The habitual offenders are tagged in the same category in relation to classification of high risk offenders and for determination of the level of security for effective surveillance.263 Similarly, regarding the women prisoners, it has been provided that “Habitual offenders shall be separated from casual prisoners”264 and that “Habitual offenders, prostitutes and brothel keepers must also be confined separately”.265 258 Ibid 259 Para 13 of Chapter I, Model Prison Manual 2016 260 Para 3 of Chapter I, Model Prison Manual 2016 261 Para 2.03 of Chapter II, Model Prison Manual 2016 262 Ibid, Para 24.01 263 Ibid, Para 25.02 264 Ibid, Para 26.04 (ii) 265 Ibid, 26.04 (iii) [2024] 10 S.C.R. 621 Sukanya Shantha v. Union of India & Ors. 202. In a previous section of this , we highlighted that the phrase “habitual offender” in several prison manuals refers to people from denotified or wandering tribes. Therefore, this definition cannot be left to be interpreted and applied “in accordance with the provisions of applicable law or rules”. Otherwise, what it will end up doing is to classify and separate people from denotified tribes in prisons without any basis. 203. Second, the Manual does not explicitly prohibit physical caste- based segregation of prisoners, except in prisons for women.
