Therefore, the minority educational E institutions like the respondents could not continue the employees/teachers beyond the age of 58 years or 60 years as the case may be. If an employee or a teacher is continued in service by the management of any registered minority Secondary School receiving Grant-in-Aid from the State-Government, then F such school would not be entitled to receive any grant in respect of the expenditure incurred for continuing such employee or teacher beyond the age of 58 or 60 years, as the case may be. The provisions of Grant-in-Aid Code are applicable to all the registered secondary education institutions desirous of receiving or which are receiving the grant from the Government, and such G institutions would be subject to the restrictions imposed under the Code, except for the matters provided in the said Regulations. [Para 8][493-G-H; 494-A-C] 1.3 The provisions contained in the said Grant-in-Aid Code pertaining to the recognition, eligibility criteria, the procedure H THE STATE OF GUJARAT v. H. B. KAPADIA EDUCATION 489 TRUST for making application to the government for receiving Grant-in- A Aid etc. are applicable to all the secondary schools whether established and administered by the minority or not and the respondents could not have claimed any right to receive the aid from the Government dehors the provisions of the Grant-in-Aid Code. If the appellants therefore had refused to pay the Grant- B in-Aid to the respondents, on the Principal having reached to the age of superannuation, it could not be said by any stretch of imagination that the appellants had interfered with the affairs of the respondents or had violated Article 30(1) of the Constitution. The respondent-institution was bound by the provisions contained in the Grant-in-Aid Code. There is also nothing on record to show C that the appellant-State had discriminated against the respondent institution on the ground that it was under the management of a minority, attracting Article 30(2) of the Constitution of India. The High Court therefore had committed gross error in holding that the respondent-institute had a right to continue the Principal of D its school beyond his age of 60 years, and in directing the appellants to calculate and pay the requisite amount towards the arrears ofgrant for the period from 2001 to 2012.
