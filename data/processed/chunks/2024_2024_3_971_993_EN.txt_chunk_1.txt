48 of the Indian Arbitration Act – Accordingly, the decision given by the High Court for enforcement/execution of the foreign award stands approved. [Paras 27, 28, 29, 35.1, 36, 43] Arbitration – Foreign Award – Bias – Standard of public policy in India: Held: Embracing international standards in arbitration would foster trust, certainty, and effectiveness in the resolution of disputes on a global scale – In India, an internationally recognized narrow standard of public policy must be adopted, when dealing with the aspect of bias – It is only when the most basic notions of morality [2024] 3 S.C.R. 973 Avitel Post Studioz Limited & Ors. v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Limited (Previously Named Hpeif Holdings 1 Limited) or justice are violated that this ground can be attracted – The Supreme Court in Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. v. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had noted that the ground of most basic notions of morality or justice can only be invoked when the conscience of the Court is shocked by infraction of fundamental notions or principles of justice – There can be no difficulty in holding that the most basic notions of morality and justice under the concept of ‘public policy’ would include bias – However, Courts must endeavor to adopt international best practices instead of domestic standards, while determining bias – It is only in exceptional circumstances that enforcement should be refused on the ground of bias. [Paras 25 and 26] Arbitration – Foreign Award – Bias – Challenge at enforcement stage: Held: If the ground of arbitral bias is raised at the enforcement stage, it must be discouraged by the Courts to send out a clear message to the stakeholders that Indian Courts would ensure enforcement of a foreign Award unless it is demonstrable that there is a clear violation of morality and justice – The determination of bias should only be done by applying international standards – Refusal of enforcement of foreign award should only be in a rare case where, non-adherence to International Standards is clearly demonstrable.
