1048, dated E 12.01.2016. The Tehsildar, Muzaffarnagar by No. 1423F dated 23.01.2016, restrained transfer of property by sale, donation or any other mode, and also created a charge on the properties. The corporate debtor initially underwent resolution process under the IBC, however that process was not successful. It therefore became subject to liquidation. F 4. Under the final bill dated 27.01.2017, the total arrears due were 4,32,33,883/-. Of this, the District Collector issued notice for recovery of outstanding dues to the tune of 2,50,14,080/-, by auction of movable and immovable properties located at Khasara No. 0.4710, on 05.03.2018. The liquidator alleged that unless the attachment s of the District G Collector, Muzaffarnagar and Tehsildar, Muzaffarnagar were set aside by the NCLT, no buyer would purchase the property of the corporate debtor due to uncertainty about the authority of the liquidator to sell the property. The liquidator also took the plea that PVVNL’s claim would 1 Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No. 639 of 2018, dated 15.05.2019. H 2 C.A. No. 88/ALD/2018 in CP No. (IB) 23/ALD/2017, dated 21.08.2018. PASCHIMANCHAL VIDYUT VITRAN NIGAM LTD. v. RAMAN 1233 ISPAT PRIVATE LIMITED & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] be classified in of priority prescribed under Section 53 of the IBC, A and PVVNL would be entitled to pro rata distribution of proceeds along with the other secured creditors from sale of liquidation assets. 5. The liquidator’s position ultimately led the NCLAT to direct the District Magistrate and Tehsildar, Muzaffarnagar to immediately release the attached property in its favour so as to enable sale of the property, B and after realisation of the property’s value, to ensure its distribution in accordance with the relevant provisions of the IBC. The NCLAT also endorsed NCLT’s reasoning that PVVNL fell within the definition of ‘operational creditor’, which could realize its dues in the liquidation process in accordance with the law. C II. PVVNL’SARGUMENTS 6. Mr. Pradeep Mishra, learned advocate for PVVNL, submitted that Sections 173 and 174 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (hereinafter, “2003 Act”) had an overriding effect on all other laws except Consumer Protection Act, 1986; the Atomic Energy Act,1962; and the Railway D Act, 1989. Being a special law relating to all aspects of electricity – generation, transmission, distribution and adjudication of disputes– it had primacy over all other laws, including the IBC, which was a ‘general’ law dealing with corporate insolvency implemented much later. In terms of the 2003 Act, and the regulations framed under it, including the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Supply Code, 2005 (hereinafter, “2005 Code”), a E special mechanism for recovery of electricity dues existed. The rights of electricity suppliers like PVVNL, therefore, were not subordinate and subject to the ‘priority of claims’ mechanism under the IBC. Therefore, PVVNL could opt to independently stay out of the liquidation process and recover its dues. F 7. Learned counsel relied on the of this court in Board of Trustees, Port of Mumbai v. Indian Oil Corporation,3 wherein this court had ruled that port dues, under the Major Port Trust Act, 1963 overrode all other claims, including those of secured creditors in liquidation proceedings.
