All other reliefs sought for in the application of the appellant came to be denied. Hence the appellant has approached this Court by way of the present civil appeal. CONTENTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT IN THE PRESENT APPEAL: 32. It is the contention of learned counsel appearing for the appellant that the tribunal erred in not passing an on merits on the premise that the issue is seisin before this Court. It is further contended that WP No.495 of 2010 was filed challenging the criteria of minimum 40 per cent canopy density for identification as forest land. In the teeth of the of this Court dated 28.03.2008 passed in batch of IA’s filed in WP No.202 of 1995 (T.N. Godavarman) in which the petition was amended and the minimum 5 (five) hectares area was also challenged in view of FSI’s affidavit which stated that minimum 1 (one) hectare of area and minimum 10 per cent canopy or the criteria adopted by FSI for identifying the forest cover in India and this writ petition was transferred to the tribunal. Hence, it is contended that identification of private forests on the basis of criteria accepted by FSI and by this Court in the of 2008 passed for determining NPV also to be adopted and followed for identification of forest, 718 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports which would be in the interest of protection of environment and also a step for implementing the dated 12.12.1996 passed by this Court as it has remained unmet by the State of Goa. 33. By referring to the three interim s, namely 17.12.2006 and 26.03.2012 passed by the High Court and the dated 04.02.2015 passed by this Court, it is contended that authorities have been injuncted from issuing conversion Sanad for any private properties with tree cover in excess of 0.1 all having natural vegetation and tree canopy density in excess of 0.1 and area above 1 (one) hectare which would clearly indicate that in to protect the environment this relief was essential and so as to prevent any further degradation of the forest by its destruction. 34. It is also contended that to meet the mandate of the dated 12.12.1996 the identification and demarcation of private forest area on the basis of 1 (one) hectare and 10 percent (0.1) canopy density is an exercise which must be carried out for meeting the said criteria which would be over and above the identification of forest area done on the criteria that is 75 per cent forest species, 40 per cent canopy density and 5 (five) hectare of area, as the objective is to ensure restoration (and not diversion) of such forest area to their original status. Hence, contending if such identification is done on the basis of this criteria, it would sub-serve the interest of conservation and protection of environment and in a given case the Central/State Government can grant ‘prior permission’ within the provisions of FCA 1980 if it considers that such diversion is necessary in public interest and it would be in consonance with the principle of sustainable development.
