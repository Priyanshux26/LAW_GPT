32. The learned counsel further submitted that one additional issue arises in the present litigation relating to non-compliance of the mandatory requirement under Section 17(Second proviso) of the 1988 Act. E According to the learned counsel the chargesheet in C.C.No.13 of 2015 on the file of the XIII Additional Special Judge for CBI Cases, Chennai, was filed by Mr. Syed Bazlullah ASP/CBI/ACB/Chennai. Upon perusal of the chargesheet which was served on the accused by the Magistrate under Section 207 of the CrPC, it was noticed that the same does not F include the passed by an officer not below the Rank of Superintendent of Police, as mandatorily required under Section 17(Second proviso) of the 1988 Act, conferring powers to Mr. Syed Bazlullah to investigate this case in RC MA 1 2006 A 0027 for an offence under Section 13(1)(e) of the 1988 Act, which thereon got culminated into the chargesheet in C.C.No.13 of 2015. It was argued that the non- G compliance of Section 17(Second proviso) of the 1988 Act is an illegality that vitiates the entire trial. 33. In support of the aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the following case law: H 150 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A (i) Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali alias Deepak and Others reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762; (ii) Vinubhai Haribhai Malaviya v. State of Gujarat reported in (2019) 17 SCC 1; and (iii) Luckose Zachariah alias Zak Nedumchira Luke and B Others v. Joseph Joseph and Others reported in (2022) SCC Online SC 241. ANALYSIS 34. Section 169 of the CrPC reads as under: C “169. Release of accused when evidence deficient.— If, upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to the officer in charge of the police station that there is not sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify the forwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer shall, D if such person is in custody, release him on his executing a bond, with or without sureties, as such officer may direct, to appear, if and when so required, before a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police report, and to try the accused or commit him for trial.” E 35. The perusal of the aforesaid Section would reveal that the Investigating Officer is under an obligation to release such person, who is in custody on executing a bond with or without sureties, if evidence is not sufficient and/or there are no reasonable grounds of suspicion to forward such person to the Magistrate. F 36. The plain reading of Section 169 of the CrPC, therefore, postulates that when the Investigating Officer reports his action to the learned Magistrate, it will not be a report, however it will be a report of his action either by the Investigating Officer or by the Officer in-charge of the police station. G 37. Section 173 of the CrPC states about the steps to be taken by the Investigating Officer after the completion of the investigation.
