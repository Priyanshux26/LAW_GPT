15. The appellant stated before NGT that there was no basis for criteria No. (iii) in the guidelines of 1991, which related to canopy density, as there are several forest areas, which are presently degraded and having canopy density of less than 0.4 but which were originally dense or medium dense forests and which must, accordingly, be identified as forests. It was also submitted that such lands cannot be unilaterally diverted to non-forestry purpose except with the prior approval under the FCA 1980. It was submitted that if criteria No. (iii) was accepted there would be no compliance with the directions given in terms of reference No.2 of the dated 12.12.1996. 16. To back its contentions, the appellant relied upon this Court’s dated 28.03.200817 wherein this court while deciding the matters relating to Net Present Value (NPV) and compensatory afforestation costs accepted the report submitted by the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) titled “Supplementary Report of CEC in IA No.826 & IA No.566 regarding calculation of Net Present Value (NPV) payable on Loss of Forest Lands of Different Types in non-forest purpose”. This Court had accepted the CEC’s recommendations on certain economic values, proposed for Calculating the NPV and costs for Compensatory Afforestation (CA), involved in diversion of dense, moderate dense and open forest. 17. The appellant further relied upon the FSI Report, according to which, forest vegetation in the country falls specifically in three mutually inclusive canopy density classes: i. Very Dense Forest (with crown density) 0.7 to 1. ii. Moderate dense Forest (with crown density) 0.4 to 0.7. iii. Open forest (with crown density) 0.1 to 0.4. 17 in Writ Petition No.202 of 1995 714 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 18. It was, therefore, argued by the appellant before NGT that for the purpose of implementation of the FCA 1980, all the authorities including this Court, have clearly accepted that the areas of natural vegetation, having tree canopy density varying anywhere between 0.1 to 0.4, are to be considered as forest for the purpose of applicability of FCA 1980 and thereafter determination of NPV and CA. This aspect of enlarging the scope of criteria No.3 will be an essential step, as the report of the FSI, 2009 showed that the category of open forest (crown density of 0.1 to 0.4) is almost the same in extent, as both the categories of very dense forest and moderate dense forests are put together. 19. With regard to criteria No. (ii), which requires Minimum 5 Ha, the appellant had argued that the said criteria is defeating the purpose and mandate of FCA 1980 and the of this Court dated 12.12.1996. 20. It was submitted before the tribunal that the FSI in its affidavit dated 23rd March 2011, submitted that it defines ‘forest cover’ as being all lands, more than 1 ha area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10% irrespective of ownership and legal status. Such lands may not necessarily be recorded as forest areas. Therefore, the appellant sought the following reliefs in the Application No.14 (THC) of 2013: “For an quashing the criteria nos.
