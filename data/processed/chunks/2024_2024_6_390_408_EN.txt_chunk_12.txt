The appellate court, if it seeks to reverse those findings of fact, must give cogent reasons to demonstrate how the trial court fell into an obvious error. 52. With respect to the High Court, we think, that, what the High Court did was what perhaps even an appellate court, with full-fledged appellate jurisdiction 408 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports would, in the circumstances of the present case, have felt compelled to abstain from and reluctant to do. Contention (c) would also require to be upheld.” (emphasis in original) 25. In Jagannath v. Arulappa & Anr.8 and H.K.N. Swami v. Irshad Basith (Dead) By Lrs.9, this Court has opined that it would be wholly improper to allow first appeal without adverting to the specific findings of the trial court and that the First Appellate Court is required to address all the issues and determine the appeal upon assignment of cogent reasons. 26. Having considered the evidence on record and the findings of the trial court, the First Appellate Court and the High Court, we are satisfied that the First Appellate Court wrongly set aside the , decree, and findings of the trial court without meeting the findings of the trial court which could not have been done in exercise of power under Section 96 CPC. Therefore, the High Court has rightly set aside the and decree of the First Appellate Court to restore the and decree of the trial court. On independent examination also, we have found that the findings recorded by trial court are borne out from the evidence on record and are neither perverse nor illegal. 27. Therefore, we find no substance in this appeal which deserves to be and is hereby dismissed. 28. The parties shall bear their own costs. Result of the case: Review Petition allowed and Civil Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain 8 (2005) 12 SCC 303 9 (2005) 10 SCC 243
