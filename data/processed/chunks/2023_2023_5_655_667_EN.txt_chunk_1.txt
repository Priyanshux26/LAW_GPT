On the issue of deposit of compensation with the Reference Court, the position of law has been settled in Indore Development Authority’s case. [Para 9][661-G-H; 662-A-B] D 2. The issue as to what is meant by “possession of the land by the State after its acquisition” has also been considered in Indore Development Authority’s case. It is opined therein that after the acquisition of land and passing of award, the land vests in the State free from all encumbrances. The vesting of land with the E State is with possession. Any person retaining the possession thereafter has to be treated trespasser. When large chunk of land is acquired, the State is not supposed to put some person or police force to retain the possession and start cultivating on the land till it is utilized. The Government is also not supposed to start residing or physically occupying the same once process of the F acquisition is complete. If after the process of acquisition is complete and land vest in the State free from all encumbrances with possession, any person retaining the land or any re-entry made by any person is nothing else but trespass on the State land. [Para 11][664-H; 665-A-C] G 3. From the facts as are available on record, it is evident that Respondent no.1 was admittedly not the recorded owner of the land at time of acquisition thereof or pronouncement of Award by the Land Acquisition Collector. The amount of compensation was deposited with the Reference Court in term of Section 30/31 H DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. ANITA SINGH & 657 ORS. of the 1894 Act as the same could not be paid to Respondent A no.1. Hence, one of the conditions being satisfied, the passed by the High Court cannot be legally sustained whereby the acquisition has been held to have lapsed in terms of Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act.
