Whether on 28/4/1996 the deal was done by the deceased Jugalal with the Respondent/Plaintiff to sell the disputed land? 2. Whether earnest money of Rs.6,000/- was paid by the respondent/plaintiff to the deceased Jugalal on 28/4/1996? 3. Is the suit of the respondent/plaintiff time barred? 4. Relief and cost.” 8. The First Appellate Court looked into two issues. First, whether the plaintiff was ready and willing to perform his part of the contract, and secondly whether hardship would be caused to the defendant, 724 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports which could not be foreseen at the time of the execution of the agreement of sale. 9. The First Appellate Court observed the following in paras 28, 29 and 32 respectively:- “28. It is to be mentioned that the Exhibit P 1 Agreement was executed on 28/4/1996 between the Respondent/Plaintiff and the deceased Jugalal, while the first written notice was given by him on 13/1/01 i.e. after about 5 years. In Exhibit P.1, although no time limit was prescribed in relation to the registration of the sale deed, but even after not registering the sale deed by the deceased Jugalal for 5 years, no action is taken by the respondent / plaintiff, which raises doubts about his readiness. It is also noteworthy that in December 2001, even after receiving the refusal notice to register the sale deed by the deceased Jugalal, the second notice (Exhibit P.2) was not given immediately and it was sent by the respondents on 23.07.2002 i.e. after 7 months. 29. If the respondent/plaintiff was actually ready to register the sale deed, the suit should have been filed immediately after the refusal of registration by the deceased Jugalal in December, 2001, but by not doing so, after 7 months the notice Exhibit P.2 was given, even after the reply of which November, 2002, the suit was not filed till 4/3/03. All the above facts indicate that the respondent/plaintiff has not kept any readiness for registration of sale deed. xxx xxx xxx xxx 32. Therefore, in the present case, in the context of the above-mentioned case law and on the basis that the agreement was executed by the respondent / plaintiff in the year 1996 but no legal action was taken for 7-8 years, it is not legal to pass the for the specific performance of the contract. In the above circumstances, it will be open specific the sufficient grant alternate relief to refund the amount of earnest money.” 10. Thus, the first appellate court partly allowed the appeal filed by the plaintiffs herein and set aside that part of the decree passed by the trial court directing specific performance.

Issue No.4: In the context of the above discussion, the present Appeal under 41 Rule 1 read with Section 96 of CPC is partly allowed and the impugned and decree dated 15/2/10 passed by the learned trial court i.e.
