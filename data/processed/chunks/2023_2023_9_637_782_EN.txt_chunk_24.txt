38. The words “price”, “tariff”, or “charges” have not been defined C in the 1910 Act or the 2003 Act. In AP TRANSCO v. Sai Renewable Power (P) Ltd,24 this Court observed that the term “tariff” has neither been defined nor explained in the 2003 Act. The Court held that in the absence of any specific definition in the legislation, recourse has to be taken to the “meaning attached to these expressions under the general D law or in common parlance.”25 39. In BSES Ltd. v. Tata Power Co. Ltd.,26 a two-judge Bench of this Court interpreted ‘tariff’ in the context of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998. It observed: “16. The word “tariff” has not been defined in the Act. “Tariff” E is a cartel of commerce and normally it is a book of rates. It will mean a schedule of standard prices or charges provided to the category or categories of customers specified in the tariff.” 40. The proviso to Section 43(2) further refers to the “price” payable by an applicant to demand or to continue to receive the supply F of electricity from a distribution licensee. The “price” is to be determined by the appropriate commission. This “price” is the consideration, as determined by the State Commission, that an applicant pays for receiving a supply of electricity. 41. The term “price” has to be given a broad meaning to include G all the ‘tariffs’ and ‘charges’ that may be determined by the appropriate commission. This includes the ‘charges’ fixed under Section 45 by the appropriate commission from time to time and the ‘charges’ that a 24 (2011) 11 SCC 34 25 (2011) 11 SCC 34 H 26 (2004) 1 SCC 195 K. C. NINAN v. KERALA STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD & 673 ORS. [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] distribution licensee may impose under Section 46 to recover any A reasonable expenditure. The ambit of the term ‘price’ is wide enough to also include the statutory dues that the State Commission decides to enact by way of regulations under Section 50. 42. Thus, the duty to supply electricity under Section 43 is not absolute, and is subject to the such charges and compliances stipulated B by the distribution licensees as part of the application. II. Duty to supply electricity is with respect to consumer 43. The Electric Utilities urge that the duty to supply electricity is with respect to the premises and not to an individual. They refer to the C definition of ‘consumer’ under Section 2(15) and to Section 43 of the 2003 Act. Further, it was urged that Section 50 and Section 181(2)(x) of the 2003 Act enable the distribution licensee to provide for payment of dues of electricity supplied to the premises if a reconnection or new connection is sought for the same premises. Contrariwise, the auction purchasers have submitted that the consumption of electricity is always D by the owner or occupier of the premises through appliances and apparatus installed within the premises. The reference to premises in the definition of ‘consumer’ under Section 2(15) as well as Section 43 of the 2003 Act is, it is urged, only to fix a situs for the supply of electricity to the owner or occupier of the premises.
