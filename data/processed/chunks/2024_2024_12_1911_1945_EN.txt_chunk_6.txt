Suit of the plaintiff is decreed.

The defendants being dissatisfied with the above filed Regular Second Appeal No. 243 of 2014 before the High Court seeking to challenge the and dated 16.05.2014 passed in TA No.30 of 2011 referred to above. s. The High Court formulated two substantial questions of law for its consideration: “A. Whether the plaintiff/respondent is entitled to get partition of the land being under Section 97 of Assam Land Revenue Regulation? B. Whether the suit is barred under Section 154 of the Assam Land Revenue Regulation?” t. The High Court allowed the Second Appeal filed by the defendants and thereby quashed and set aside the and Decree passed by the First Appellate Court. The High Court held that the Section 154(1)(e) of the Regulation, 1886 bars the civil court from exercising its jurisdiction and further that the revenue court had rightly rejected the prayer of partition under Section 97 as whoever seeks partition of the land must be in possession of the land. The High Court while allowing the Second Appeal observed in Paras 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 respectively as under:- “12. There is no doubt that a civil court is empowered to decide the right of a person in respect of a property but section 154(1)(e) of the Regulation of 1886 states that no civil court shall exercise jurisdiction in case of claims of persons to imperfect partition, except in cases in which a perfect partition could not be claimed from, and being refused by the revenue authorities on the ground that the result of such partition would 1922 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports be to form a separate estate liable for an annual amount of revenue less than 5 rupees. 13. It is an admitted fact that the revenue authorities refused the prayer of partition made by Abdul Rejak Laskar. It was rejected on the ground that he did not have possession over the said 1.5 kathas of land. Under Section 97 of Regulation of 1886, whoever seeks partition of a land, he must be in possession of that land. It is also an admitted fact that Abdul Rejak Laskar is not in possession of that land and, therefore, the revenue authorities rightly rejected his prayer for partition. 14. Under the aforesaid premised reasons, the substantial questions of law are answered accordingly. 15. Now, this court is of the opinion that the learned civil judge erroneously reversed the of the Civil Judge (Jr. Division No. 1), Nagaon. Therefore, and decree dated 16.05.2014 passed by the Civil Judge, Nagaon, in Title Appeal No.30/2011 arising out of the and decree dated 16.07.2011 passed by the Munsif No.
