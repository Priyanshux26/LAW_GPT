[Para 14] Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 – Period of limitation: Held: While referring to the period of limitation of one month of filing a complaint for the purpose of Section 138 of the NI Act 1881, the same is to begin after the drawer of the cheque has [2024] 8 S.C.R. 123 Sri Dattatraya v. Sharanappa failed to discharge his liability to the presenter within the prescribed period of 15 days as per the Proviso (c) to Section 138 of the NI Act 1881 – A cojoint reading of Sections 138 and 142 of the NI Act 1881 makes it clear that the cause of action only arises after the failure of the drawer to pay, subsequent to the receipt of the notice, and the complainant is restricted from initiating multiple complaints against the concerned drawer at different stages contemplated prior. [Para 16] Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s. 143 – Summary Trial – Attendance of accused – Non-bailable warrant: Held: In light of such object encapsulated in the Amendment to Chapter VIII, the Parliament by virtue of Section 143 of the NI Act 1881 prescribed procedure of summary trial enlisted in provisions of Sections 260 to 265 of the CrPC 1973 to be adopted during proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881 – Therefore, it can be observed that the court shall adopt a liberal approach with regard to attendance of an accused person and until an accused’s presence is indispensable, a court can allow for an exemption, in case of existence of any exceptional circumstances – Moreover, issuance of a non-bailable warrant in case of absence of the accused, at the first instance, shall, due to any circumstance, be avoided. [Para 17] Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.139 – Presumption in favour of holder: Held: The aforesaid presumption entails an obligation on the court conducting the trial for an offence under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881 to presume that the cheque in question was issued by the drawer or accused for the discharge of a particular liability – The use of expression “shall presume” ameliorates the conundrum pertaining to the right of the accused to present evidence for the purpose of rebutting the said presumption – Furthermore, the effect of such presumption is that, upon filing of the complaint along with relevant documents, thereby prima facie establishing the case against the drawer, the onus of proof shifts on the drawer or accused to adduce cogent material and evidence for rebutting the said presumption, and as established in Laxmi Dyechem v. State of Gujarat and others, based on preponderance of probabilities.
