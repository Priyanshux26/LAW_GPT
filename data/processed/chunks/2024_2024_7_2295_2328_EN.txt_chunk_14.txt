L.J.726 (para 8) 10 The TP Act 11 [1969] 3 SCR 497 : (1969) 1 SCC 497 (para 3) 12 [2003] 2 SCR 564 : (2003) 4 SCC 161 (para 5) 13 [2009] 9 SCR 1048 : (2009) 7 SCC 363 (para 15-18) 14 [2010] 4 SCR 515 : (2010) 5 SCC 401 [para 12,13,15] 15 [2023] 14 SCR 28 : SLP No.15774 of 2023. 2316 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 21.18. To elaborate the above argument following further facts were stated: a) Appellant No.1 in his cross-examination (at Pg.135) has admitted that Defendant No.1 (original Vendor) was not called for completing process of registration on 14.06.2011 and that there is no endorsement of the Sub-Registrar on the last page of Sale Deed about completion of registration. Therefore, the mandates of Section 60, which prescribes as to what constitutes a Certificate of registration is not fulfilled and hence, the alleged sale deed was not validly registered on 14.06.2011 and therefore, alleged sale deed dated 02.12.1985 cannot be treated as a registered sale deed. b) That the alleged sale deed was registered in violation of Section 32 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and Sections 17 and 20 of the Act, 1908. The essential requirement under Section 54 of the TP Act were also not fulfilled. That from the record as well as the admission of appellant no.1, it is clear from the serial number of the stamps that the same are not in continuum. c) As per Section 32 of the Stamp Act when any instrument is brought to the Collector then the Collector may determine the Stamp Duty. That in the present case, the alleged Sale Deed shows that at the time of presentation the stamp of Rs.1600/- was given but on 14.06.2011 the Sub-Registrar accepted extra amount of Rs.2200/- and penalty of Rs.500/- but there is no endorsement to show that it was sent to the Collector for determining the Stamp duty and it is not shown in the Sale Deed that deficit stamp duty was affixed. As per Sections 33 and 34 of the Stamp Act, the Collector has power to impound the document. d) The alleged sale deed does not show that under which provision of law the Sub-Registrar had accepted the deficit charges after 26 years and no reasons were given as to why it was kept pending for such a long time. e) Even if assuming for the sake of arguments without admitting that the alleged sale deed was presented [2024] 7 S.C.R.
