There is nothing wrong in UPSC 72 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. strictly adhering to this stipulation, being in the nature of an eligibility criterion. The respondents are justifi ed and right in urging that this stipulation is inviolable as expounded in Ashok Kumar Sharma & Ors. vs. Chander Shekhar & Anr., (1997) 4 SCC 18 and subsequent decisions of this Court which need not be multiplied. 8.At the same time, it cannot, however, be denied that 2020 was an abnormal and cataclysmal year due to the ongoing pandemic, lockdowns and restrictions. UPSC had to postpone their examination like all other Universities/Boards. The results of the qualifying examination in the case of petitioners, thus, got delayed. This was entirely beyond control of the petitioners who were certainly eligible on the date they appeared in the preliminary examination and had qualifi ed for the main examination, in which they had appeared. Admittedly, the petitioners had attained the qualifying eligibility criteria before the main examination was conducted by UPSC in January, 2021 (i.e., between 08.01.2021 and 17.01.2021). … …. …. 12.Accordingly, we issue direction to UPSC to permit the 5 candidates, as a special case, to participate in the personality test/interview in the respective categories in which they have qualifi ed. The addition of these 5 candidates would not be to the disadvantage of any already empanelled candidate in the published list for personality test/interview in the respective branches/categories. We also clarify that this should not be treated as a precedent.” 60. This exceptional situation cannot be made a rule. In this case, the petitioner (Ms. Divya) had an opportunity to obtain I&AC from 01.04.2021 till 21.02.2022. In fact, admittedly she obtained her EWS certifi cate for the F.Y. 2019-2020 on 09.10.2020 and obtained her I&AC for F.Y. 2021-2022 on 13.12.2022 but obtained her I&AC 2020-2021 only on 01.06.2023. If she was in a position to obtain a certifi cate for F.Y. 2019-2020 on 09.10.2020 when the country was still reeling under a heightened pandemic, there is no reason why she could not have obtained her I&AC for the F.Y. 2021- 2022 on any of the days between 01.04.2021 and 21.02.2022. We are not DIVYA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 73 [K. V. VISWANATHAN, J.] satisfi ed with the explanation adduced by the petitioner. Hence her claim challenging the e-mail cancelling the candidature under the EWS category is also rejected. Validity of CSE-2022 Rules – Validity of the Cut-off date: 61. The challenge made in the writ petition to declare Rules 13, 27(3) and 28 to the extent it prescribes that candidate must be in possession of a EWS certifi cate as on the closing date of the application for preliminary examination to be ultra vires Article 14 is only to be stated to be rejected. There is no case made out to show that the cut-off of 22.02.2022 was picked out of the hat. That was the last date for submission of the application and, according to us, it was a validly prescribed cut-off .
