[Paras 12 and 13] While setting aside the of the High Court, the Supreme Court held that a general reference to the terms and conditions of another contract would not have the effect of incorporating the arbitration clause – It is pertinent to note that clause 7.0 of the L.O.I. specifically uses the word “Only” before the words “be through civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone” – When there is a reference in the second contract to the terms and conditions of the first contract, the arbitration clause would not ipso facto be applicable to the second contract unless there is specific mention/reference thereto – The present case is not a case of ‘incorporation’ but a case of ‘reference’ – As such, a general reference would not have the effect of incorporating the arbitration clause – Clause 7.0 of the L.O.I, which is also a part of the agreement, makes it amply clear that the redressal of the dispute between NBCC and respondent has to be only through civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone – Delhi High Court has erred in allowing the application of the respondent.
