The executive instruction (which explicitly prohibits the release of a prisoner involved in the “murder of a woman”), it was argued – not only came after his completion of 25 years of incarceration, but in any case could not override the statutory provisions. Counsel submitted that the petitioner had a legal right to be considered for remission given the safeguards of a convict under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India; this legal right was guaranteed by the Prison Act, and the Rules framed under it. 6 G.O.(Ms.) NO. 116/2022/HOME dated 14.06.2022. JOSEPH v. THE STATE OF KERALA 513 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] 10. Relying on replies received (under the Right to Information Act, 2005) from the respective jails in which the petitioner has been lodged – counsel demonstrated that from 2000-2016, a total of 28 convicts sentenced to life imprisonment, who were involved in the murder of a woman, had been granted premature release. However, despite being recommended three times by the Advisory Board with detailed remarks on his reformation, the State government had rejected his case for premature release without assigning any reasoning, in its s. This, it was argued, was grounds for setting aside these s. 11. Lastly, counsel pointed to material produced by the respondent state itself, to demonstrate that the Jail Advisory Board had found the petitioner, who is aged 67 years old, to be hardworking, disciplined, and reformed, and prayed for his premature release. 12. To supplement his submissions, counsel placed reliance on various s of this court, including – State of Haryana v. Jagdish7, Maru Ram, v. Union of India8, General Offi cer Commanding-in-Chief v. Subhash Chandra Yadav9, State of Haryana v. Mahender Singh10, and State v. H. Nilofer Nisha11. 13. Mr. Jaideep Gupta, learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf of the state, submitted that the petitioner cannot claim a fundamental right to be released on remission, and that the prayer sought in the writ petition – for this court’s direction to the government to release him – was simply not maintainable. 14. Counsel argued that grant of remission, is solely at the executive’s discretion, and an act of mercy, granted on account of good conduct and term of imprisonment. It is not an indefeasible right; rather the convict only has a right to be considered for remission, which he had been, in the present case. The decision, however, of whether to be granted remission, was an act of exercising discretion which solely fell within the domain of the executive. 7 [2010] 3 SCR 716 8 [1981] 1 SCR 1196 9 [1988] 3 SCR 62 10 [2007] 11 SCR 932 11 (2020) 14 SCC 161 514 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 15. Mr. Gupta drew attention to the nature of the crime – that it was premediated and cold-blooded murder, with robbery. The assault of an innocent young woman by someone she reposed trust in, her brother-in-law no less, who proceeded to rob her belongings and lay her to her death in such a horrifi c manner, it was argued was one which shocked the collective conscience of society.
