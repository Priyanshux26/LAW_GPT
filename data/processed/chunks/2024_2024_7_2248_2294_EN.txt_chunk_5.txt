DW-2 stated that the sale instance referred to in the case of Brijmohan Bhartiya was not considered as that land was far away from the suit property. DW-2 admitted that there was no reference in the award Exh.46 to the effect that the suit property was in a ‘Blue Zone’ and that he could not assign any reason why it was not so referred. B. Findings of the Reference Court 12. The Reference Court, by its dated 02.08.2008, after setting out the legal position that the potentiality of the acquired lands is to [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2255 Kazi Akiloddin v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. be seen as relevant consideration, set out to analyze the evidence. It noticed the deposition of the claimant witnesses to the effect that the land was abutting the Akola Gaothan; that adjoining properties have been converted to non-agricultural purpose; that the suit property was surrounded by residential houses, societies, sub-markets and luxury bus stand; that maps and photographs establishing the said fact have been produced and held that the claimant had discharged the initial onus. Dealing with the evidence of the State, it held that maps produced at Exh.57 to Exh.59 and Exh.141 only showed that a small strip of blue colour was shown as passing through the suit property and that it was not clear whether the whole area of the property is covered under ‘Blue Zone’. It highlighted the fact that in the award Exh.46 there was no reference about the suit property falling in the ‘Blue Zone’ and that the said factor had no bearing while computing the award amount. After discussing the proximity of the property to developed areas, it held that the acquired property was within the municipal limit of Akoli city and that evidence on record showed that the property was surrounded by public offices, roads and Government residential quarters. 13. The Reference Court held that the Land Acquisition Officer had not worked out the market value properly since many relevant factors were ignored. It referred to Exh.71 Sale Exemplar dated 10-5-1999 and the index II extracts at Exh.73(14-7-98) and Exh.74(27-8-1998) to conclude that the suit property had high potential value. It noticed that under award Exh.46, the suit property (Survey No. 1), Survey No. 5/2, Survey No. 7 and Survey No. 2 situated at Akoli (Bk) were acquired by the same notification for the same purpose of construction of the said protection wall. On that basis, it held that the claimants were entitled to get the compensation at the same rate. It took on record the certified copy of the award passed in LAC No. 183 of 2000 dated 15.10.2005 at Exh.88 and found that in that case the Reference Court determined the market value @ of Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. It also noticed that copy of the award of LAC No. 209 of 2022 dated 10.08.2006 with regard to Survey No. 6, Survey No. 7 and Survey No. 60 of Akoli Khurd were acquired by another notification for the same purpose.
