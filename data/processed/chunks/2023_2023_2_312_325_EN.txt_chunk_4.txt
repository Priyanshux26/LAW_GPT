Thus, compensation to Respondent No.2 could not be found admissible for payment. 5. Respondent No.2 wife filed a Writ Petition, being CWJC No.1781/2011, before the High Court of Judicature at Patna for quashing the aforementioned letter dated 20.11.2009 and sought payment of G compensation amount of Rs.10 lakhs as per the insurance policy since her husband had died while performing election duty. Apparently, on account of some directions of the learned Single Judge, the District Election Officer placed a notice of claim dated 24.04.2011 to the Appellant H 318 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A insurance company regarding the claim for insurance. This was, however, not accepted. 6. The learned Single Judge in the Writ Petition, CWJC No.1781/ 2011, decided not to go into the issue whether the accidental death was in terms of the policy because the Chief Electoral Officer in a B supplementary counter affidavit had already acknowledged the eligibility for payment to the wife of the deceased police official. The Court, relying on the in Lilawanti Devi v. The State of Bihar & Ors1, opined that after the expiry of a given policy, no direction could be given for payment of insurance amount. The claim was required to be lodged within the duration of the policy, i.e., 24.05.2000 to 23.06.2000. Thus, C the Court opined that the primary responsibility to raise the claim under the policy was with the officials of the State Government and that they did not raise the claim within the duration of the policy and permitted the policy to lapse. Therefore, the liability to pay the amount to the deceased wife was assigned to the Chief Electoral Officer and the District D Magistrate, Vaishali. 7. The Chief Electoral Officer, preferred an appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court against the dated 17.05.2011, which is the subject matter of the impugned dated 03.10.2017. The controversy debated before the Division Bench: E 8. In LPA No.1049/2011 in so far as the insurance company is concerned, it washed its hands of the liability relying on the in Lilawanti Devi2 case. Thus, primarily, the defence was raised on the absence of any claim being lodged in time, though the death of the Police Constable during the election period of by-poll was not disputed. F 9. The appeal filed by the Chief Electoral Officer was premised on the plea to burden the liability to pay the insurance amount on the Appellant insurance company, as the insurance policy was stated to be subsisting on the relevant date. The entitlement of the family of the deceased officer to receive the amount and that to as claimed, however, G was not disputed and it was stated that the family had already been paid the amount by Respondent No.1 during the pendency of the appeal before the High Court. The grievance was solely assigning the liability on the Chief Electoral Officer and the District Magistrate, Vaishali.
