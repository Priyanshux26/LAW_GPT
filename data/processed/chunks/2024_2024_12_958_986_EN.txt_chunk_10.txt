The appellant was aged about 5 years as on the date of the accident, hence has lost his childhood and is dependent on others for his routine work.” 14.5 In Lalan (supra) cited by the claimant-appellant, the Tribunal awarded Rs. 30,000/- which was enhanced to Rs. 40,000/- by the High Court. Considering the fact that the appellant therein has suffered extensive brain injury awarded compensation under ‘pain and suffering’ to the tune of Rs. 3,00,000/-.” 24. Ultimately, this Court in the said case, in light of the authorities cited, the injuries suffered, the pain and suffering caused, and the lifelong nature of the disability afflicted upon the appellant therein (a workman who sustained multiple brain injuries which resulted in 90% permanent disability) enhanced the compensation awarded under the head of pain and suffering to Rs. 15,00,000/-. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 975 Baby Sakshi Greola v. Manzoor Ahmad Simon and Another 25. In the present case, therefore, we will have to consider the case of the appellant under various heads. a) Loss of income/earning capacity 26. In this respect, it will be appropriate to refer to the evidence of Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3). The Doctor proved the disability certificate. As per the said certificate, the appellant has suffered 75% disability. The appellant is suffering from moderate mental retardation. It was stated by the Doctor that the appellant would only be able to learn skills up-to the level of a child of 2nd Standard/Class. The appellant also has severe apathy and no control over passage of her urine. 27. Even though Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3) on assessment of the appellant opined that the disability suffered by the appellant is 75%, however, on a complete overview of the situation, it is clear that for all practical purposes, the disability of the appellant should be treated to be 100%. 28. The learned Tribunal on appreciation of the medical evidence came to a conclusion that, since the appellant was only seven years at the time of the accident, it would be appropriate to take notional income as per the MV Act to be Rs. 15,000/- per annum. The learned Tribunal applied a multiplier of 15 which was taken up-to the age of fifteen years. Therefore, an amount of 15,000/- x 15 x 75/100 = Rs. 1,68,750/- was awarded by the learned Tribunal. The High Court did not enhance the amount awarded under this head. 29. This Court in the case of Kajal (supra) has held that taking notional income is not the correct approach. Instead, the minimum wages payable to a skilled workman in the concerned State has to be taken into consideration because, that would be the minimum amount which she would have earned on becoming a major. In this case, the minimum wage payable to a skilled workman in the State of Delhi at the time of the accident, i.e., 2nd June 2009, was Rs. 4,358/- per month. 30. Further, a Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi and Others4 in paragraph 59 recorded its conclusion as follows: 4 2017 INSC 1068 : [2017] 13 SCR 100 : (2017) 16 SCC 680 976 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
