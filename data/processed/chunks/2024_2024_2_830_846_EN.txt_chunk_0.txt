[2024] 2 S.C.R. 830 : 2024 INSC 149 Naresh Kumar v. State of Haryana Criminal Appeal (No.) 1722 of 2010 22 February 2024 [J. B . Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Conviction of the appellant for the offence punishable u/s.306, Penal Code, 1860, if justified. Headnotes Penal Code, 1860 – s.306 – Abetment of suicide – Evidence Act, 1872 – s.113A – Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a married woman – When cannot be raised – Conviction of the appellant u/s.306, IPC – Correctness: Held: In to convict a person u/s.306, IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence – Mere harassment is not sufficient to hold an accused guilty of abetting the commission of suicide – It also requires an active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide – The ingredient of mens rea cannot be assumed to be ostensibly present but has to be visible and conspicuous – Presumption u/s.113A is discretionary – Before the said presumption is raised, the prosecution must show evidence of cruelty or incessant harassment in that regard – The mere fact that the deceased committed suicide within a period of seven years of her marriage, the presumption u/s.113A, Evidence Act would not automatically apply – PW-4 and PW-5 (brother and father of the deceased) only stated that after the marriage, there was a demand of some money by the appellant, as he wanted to start a ration shop and on account of such demand, the deceased used to remain tense – However, what ultimately led the deceased to take such a drastic step of committing suicide is not clear – Their evidence does not disclose any form of incessant cruelty or harassment on his part which would in ordinary circumstances drag the wife to commit suicide as if she was left with no other alternative – Mere demand of money from the wife or her parents * Author [2024] 2 S.C.R. 831 Naresh Kumar v. State of Haryana for running a business without anything more would not constitute cruelty or harassment – Prosecution did not establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt – of conviction passed by Trial Court as affirmed by the High Court, set aside – Appellant acquitted. [Paras 22, 29, 28, 10, 11 and 35-37] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.113A – Requirements under – Discussed. Evidence Act, 1872 – s.113A – Assessment of evidence – Duty of Courts: Held: Court should be extremely careful in assessing evidence u/s.113A for finding out if cruelty was meted out – If it transpires that a victim committing suicide was hyper sensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences in domestic life quite common to the society to which the victim belonged and such petulance, discord and differences were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced individual in a given society to commit suicide, the conscience of the Court would not be satisfied for holding that the accused charged of abetting the offence of suicide was guilty.
