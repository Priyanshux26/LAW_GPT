Thereafter, the creditors are paid out by the liquidator from the sale proceeds of the assets of the liquidated company. The creditors have to be paid in terms of the waterfall or priority mechanism. Therefore, payment has to be fi rst made in terms of Section 529A of the Companies Act to overriding preferential creditors, then to preferential creditors in terms of Section 530 of the Companies Act and lastly, payment has to be made and distributed pari passu among the ordinary or unsecured creditors. This objective and intent is also apparent when we examine the Company Court Rules, as per which the liquidator is to fi x a date on or before which all creditors of the company are to prove their debts or claims and to establish any title they may have to priority under Section 530 of the Companies Act.22 Not only this, the rules enable a creditor to claim interest up to the date of the winding up , and in certain circumstances, payment of interest subsequent to the date of winding up.23 There is, however, an exception to the two-fold method, as has been held in Dena Bank v. Bhikhabhai Prabhudas Parekh & Co. and Others24, which we will subsequently elucidate. 18. This brings us to the interpretation of the expressions debt ‘due’ and debt ‘due and payable’ in Section 530(1)(a) of the Companies Act. The interpretation is no longer debatable in view of the of this Court in Rajratha Naranbhai Mills Co. Ltd. v. Sales Tax Offi cer, Petlad25, which has approved the view taken by D.A. Desai, J., in his in Sales Tax Offi cer, Petlad v. Rajratna Naranbhai Mills Co. 20 See – In Re Savin, [1872] L.R. 7 Ch. App. 760, 764. 21 (1970) 40 Comp Cas 689. 22 See – Rule 147, Companies (Court) Rules, 1959. 23 See – Rules 156 and 179, Companies (Court) Rules, 1959. 24 (2000) 5 SCC 694. 25 (1991) 3 SCC 283. IDBI (THROUGH STRESSED ASSETS STABILIZATION FUND 1071 CONSTITUTED BY THE GoI)v. SUPT. OF CENTRAL EXCISE AND CUSTOMS AND OTHERS [SANJIV KHANNA, J.] Ltd. and Another26, a , which, we respectfully submit, forms the foundation of our reasoning and ratio in the present case. This Court in Rajratha Naranbhai Mills Co. Ltd. (supra), agreeing with the views expressed by D.A. Desai, J. in Sales Tax Offi cer, Petlad (supra), overruled the of the division bench under challenge, for several reasons, to hold that the words debt ‘due’ occurring in the fi rst part and the words debt ‘due and payable’ in the latter part of Section 530(1)(a) of the Companies Act are diff erent expressions meant to convey diff erent and not the same meaning. Therefore, for a government debt to be covered under clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the Companies Act, it must not only be a debt ‘due’, but it must also be a debt ‘due and payable’ within twelve months next before the relevant date. The requirements of the latter portion of clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the Companies Act are dual and cumulative, which is debt ‘due and payable’, and not one that is ‘due’.
