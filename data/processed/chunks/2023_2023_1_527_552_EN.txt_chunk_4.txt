SICGIL INDIA LTD. AND 533 OTHERS The of the Court was delivered by A PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J. 1. The short question for our consideration in this appeal relates to the scope of the rectificatory jurisdiction of the National Company Law Tribunal under Section 59 of the Companies Act, 20131. In this B context, we are called upon to determine the appropriate forum for adjudication and determination of violations of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 19972, and Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 19923, framed under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 19924. We have answered C both the questions. On the first issue, following the decision of this Court in Ammonia Supplies Corporation (P) Ltd. v. Modern Plastic Containers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.5, we have held that the rectificatory jurisdiction under Section 59 of the 2013 Act is summary in nature and not intended to be exercised where there are contested facts and disputed D questions. On the second issue, we have held that transactions falling within the jurisdiction of Regulatory bodies created under a statute must necessarily be subjected to their ex- ante scrutiny, enquiry and adjudication. We have, therefore, rejected the contention that the National Company Law Tribunal under Section 59 exercises a parallel jurisdiction with Securities and Exchange Board of India6for addressing violations E of the Regulations framed under the SEBI Act. 2. This is an appeal against the of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal7(hereinafter referred to as ‘Appellate Tribunal’) whereby the Appellate Tribunal set aside the of the National Company Law Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Tribunal’), F allowing the company petition filed by the Appellant under Section 111A of the Companies Act, 19568, (which is Section 59 of the 2013 Act), for rectification of Members Register.
