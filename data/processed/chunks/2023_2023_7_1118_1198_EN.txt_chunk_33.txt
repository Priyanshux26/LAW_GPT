Reliance has been placed on one passage in thedecision of this Court in State of Karnataka v. State of C A.P. and Ors. :(2000) 9 SCC 572 and on another decision of this Court in Surya Nath Singh and Ors. v. Khedu Singh (Dead) by LRS and Ors. :1994 Supp (3) SCC 561 to submit that balance of convenience while granting interim injunction is to be seen from the standpoint of the ‘justice of the situation’. D 17.4. It has also been argued that if the interim injunction is not granted as prayed for, irreparable injury would be caused to the appellantOPS and the persons on his side or similarly situated, who have been purportedly expelled as primary members of the party as a consequence of the resolutions passed in the General Council meeting E held on 11.07.2022. This expulsion coupled with other substantial changes made in the leadership structure of the party would, in effect, exclude OPS from participating in the affairs of the party and by the time of final adjudication of the suit, the changes made to the composition of the party would be irreversible in the absence of protective interim . F 17.5. Furthermore, on the issue of grant of interim injunction as a discretionary measure, balance of convenience and prima facie case, the learned counsel for the appellants haverelied upon the decisions of this Court in Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Chandan Nagar, West Bengal v.

Calcutta Steel Co. and Ors. : (1993) 2 SCC 199. 18. The contra contentions urged on behalf of the respondents in support of the said dated 02.09.2022 could also be usefully summarised as follows: H 1162 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A 18.1. Learned senior counsel for the respondents have submitted that the decision as to acceptance or rejection of an interim injunction is a matter of discretion, which does not require interference under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. It has also been argued that the reliefs claimed in the applications in question had beenagainst holding of the General Council meeting dated 11.07.2022, which has already been B concluded and hence, the reliefs have practically become infructuous. The decisions of this Court in Seema Arshad Zaheer and Ors. v. Municipal Corpn. of Greater Mumbai and Ors. : (2006) 5 SCC 282 and Skyline Education Institute (India) Private Limited v. S.L. Vaswani and Anr. : (2010) 2 SCC 142 have been relied upon to submit C that in the matter of grant or refusal of injunction, interference by the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India could only be considered when the discretion exercised by the High Court is vitiated by an error apparent or perversity or manifest injustice. It is submitted that the impugned dated 02.09.2022 does not suffer from any such infirmity and hence, calls for no interference.
