The petitioner has proven his readiness and willingness to perform the contract; e. The conclusion of the Trial Court that the petitioner made a false plea that he paid Rs. 34,70,000 when he has only paid Rs., 29,30,000 is erroneous. DW-1 in her deposition admitted the payments of the petitioner and admitted that the balance 3 [1982] 3 SCR 94 : (1982) 1 SCC 525 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 679 M/s Siddamsetty Infra Projects Pvt. Ltd. v. Katta Sujatha Reddy & Ors. amount of Rs.5,39,150 was deposited in the Court in her cross- examination.

Merely because the plaintiff did not institute a suit immediately after the reply to the first legal notice in 2000, it cannot be inferred that he was not willing to perform his part of the contract. The suit was filed within limitation (relied on R Lakshmi Kantham v. Devaraji (2019) 8 SCC 62; Mademsetty Satyanarayana v. G. Yelloji Rao (AIR 1965 SC 1405)); g. Time is not of essence to the contract for the reasons recorded in the Trial Court’s ; and h. Section 10 of the Specific Relief Act 1963 was amended in 2018, by which the relief of specific performance is no longer a discretionary power. Section 10 is a procedural provision. All procedural laws are retrospective. The amended provision applies to all pending proceedings. The High Court directed that since the petitioner had paid 90 percent of the sale consideration, the suit for specific performance can be decreed in favour of the petitioner to the extent proportionate to the consideration paid. The High Court further directed that the amount of Rs. 5,39,150 deposited by the petitioner pursuant to the Interlocutory Application must be refunded along with any interest that is accrued. 11.

Kamal Rani,4 in which it was held that there is no presumption that time is of essence in a contract for a sale of immovable property and the Court may infer if it was of essence based on (a) the express terms of the contract; (b) the nature of the property; and (c) surrounding circumstances such as the object of the contract. Relying on the , this Court held that in the facts of the present case, time is of essence for the following reasons: 4 [1992] Supp. 3 SCR 798 : (1993) 1 SCC 519 680 [2024] 11 S.C.R.
