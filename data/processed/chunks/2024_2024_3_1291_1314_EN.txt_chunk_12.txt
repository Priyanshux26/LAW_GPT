Directions were issued to KMERC to prepare and submit within six months, a revised comprehensive proposal of socio-economic development and eco-restoration including those relating to road infrastructure with short-term and long-term targets and study relating to the railway backbone required to support the mining activity, as suggested by certain authorities/experts. 89. This Court, in the dated 21.04.2022, granted in-principle approval to the CEPMIZ submitted by the State of Karnataka, as recommended by the CEC in its reports dated 22.10.2018 and 16.04.2019. However, this also records that the parties are at liberty to place any objections or submissions before the Oversight Authority with regard to the CEPMIZ. The states that the Oversight Authority shall decide the objections or suggest modifications after hearing the parties and taking assistance of any expert including the CEC, as may be required. Further, if any clarification is required, the parties were granted liberty to approach this Court. 90. The Oversight Authority constituted by this was to oversee the works and progress being carried out by KMERC. 91. Our attention was also drawn to the report of the CEC, dated 10.04.2022, which states that the SPV amount maintained by the Monitoring Committee exceeds Rs.20,000 crores as of 31.03.2022. This amount including the interest, which will accrue, would be adequate to meet the expenses incurred with the activities proposed to be undertaken under the CEPMIZ. This report recommends that 10% of the sale value (20% of the sale value from NMDC) being contributed towards the SPV, may be discontinued. 92. At this stage, we may record that this Court vide dated 22.02.2023, reduced the contribution of NMDC to the SPV from 20% to 10% w.e.f. 01.01.2019 and accordingly, an amount of Rs.1,326 crores has been refunded to them. 93.
