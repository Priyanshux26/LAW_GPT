The other half-share therein belonged to Phannuram and as he died intestate, it would fi rstly devolve upon his Class I heirs, in terms of Section 8 of the Act of 1956. His Class 1 heirs, as on the date of his death, were Kesar Bai, Vishal and Keja Bai, his three children. His half-share would therefore be divided equally amongst the three of them, i.e., 1/6th each. In consequence, the fi nal division of the 1/3rd share of Phannuram in the coparcenary properties would be as follows: Vishal would be entitled to 4/6th share (1/2+1/6) therein, while his sisters, Kesar Bai and Keja Bai, would each get 1/6th share therein, as they would be entitled to lay claim only to the half-share of Phannuram. As this is exactly what the Chhattisgarh High Court did and directed, we see no reason whatsoever to interfere in the matter. 14. The Civil Appeal is devoid of merit and is accordingly dismissed. Interim dated 09.10.2009 shall stand vacated. In the circumstances, parties shall bear their own costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal dismissed. Divya Pandey
