That being the position, we will briefly refer to the said enactment. 15. The Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 (briefly ‘the 1992 Act’ hereinafter) is an act to provide for the development and regulation of foreign trade by facilitating imports into and augmenting exports from India and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 15.1. Section 4 declares that all s made under the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947 and in force immediately before the commencement of the 1992 Act shall so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the 1992 Act would continue to be in force and shall be deemed to have been made under the 1992 Act. 15.2. Thus, by virtue of Section 4 of the 1992 Act, the Exim Policy of 1992-1997 continued to be in force and was deemed to have been made under the 1992 Act. 16. Section 5 of the 1992 Act, as it stood at the relevant point of time, dealt with export and import policy. As per Section 5, the Central Government may from time to time formulate and anounce by notification in the Official Gazette, the export and import policy and may also, in the like manner, amend that policy. [2024] 2 S.C.R. 101 Union of India and Ors. v. M/S. B.T. Patil and Sons Belgaum (Construction) Pvt. Ltd. 17. Rule 2(e) of the Foreign Trade (Regulation) Rules, 1993, framed under the 1992 Act, defines the word ‘policy’ to mean export and import policy formulated and announced by the Central Government under Section 5. 18. Let us now revert back to the Exim Policy, 1992 – 1997. Section 7 of the said policy ascribes meaning to the words and expressions for the purpose of the policy. As per Section 7(13), ‘drawback’ in relation to any goods manufactured in India and exported means the rebate of duty chargeable on any imported materials or excisable materials used in the manufacture of such goods in India. 19. Chapter VII of the policy provides for ‘Duty Exemption Scheme’. Section 47, which is the first section in Chapter VII, mentions that under the Duty Exemption Scheme, imports of duty free raw materials, components, intermediates, consumables, parts, spares including mandatory spares and packing materials required for the purpose of export production may be permitted by the competent authority under the five categories of licences mentioned in the said chapter, including special imprest licence. As per Section 56 (ii)(3), supplies made to projects financed by multilateral or bilateral agencies like the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development would be entitled to duty free import of raw materials, components, intermediates, consumables, parts, spares including mandatory spares and packing materials to main/sub-contractors for the manufacture and supply of products to such projects. 20. Chapter X introduced the concept of ‘deemed exports’. Section 120 defines ‘deemed exports’ to mean those transactions in which the goods supplied did not leave the country and the payment for the goods was received by the supplier in Indian rupees but the supplies earned or saved foreign exchange for the country.
