The time gap between the driver alighting from the vehicle and F noticing the theft, is very short as is clear from the facts of the case. It cannot be said that leaving the key of the vehicle in the ignition was an open invitation to steal the vehicle. [Para 15][1257- A-B] 1.8 The present case was an eminently fit case, where the G claim at 75% ought to have been awarded on a non–standard basis. Even if there was some carelessness, on the peculiar facts of this case, it was not a fundamental breach of Condition No.5 warranting total repudiation. It was rightly so ed by the District Forum and affirmed by the State Commission. [Para H 16][1258-E-F] ASHOK KUMAR v. NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. 1243 1.9 Where there is some contributory factor, a proportionate A deduction from the assured amount would be all that the Insurance Company can aspire to deduct. The plea of the appellant is accepted that in the case at hand, on the facts governing the scenario, Clause (iii) of the table set out in Amalendu Sahoo’s case is attracted and the District Forum and the State Commission B were justified in awarding the entire 75% of the admissible claim. The of the National Commission is set aside and that of the District Forum as affirmed by the State Commission is restored.
