422. Applying the standard devised above to test the validity of exercise of power by the President when the Proclamation is in force, the petitioner IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 247 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] has to fi rst prove that the exercise of power was mala fi de. 423. The eff ect of applying all the provisions of the Constitution without any modifi cations or exceptions is that the Constitution as a whole applies to Jammu and Kashmir in a manner similar to other States. Thus, the distinction that Article 370 sought to bring between Jammu and Kashmir and the other states in the First Schedule would cease to exist. As already observed, an applying all the provisions of the Constitution in exercise of power under Article 370(1)(b) has the same eff ect of declaring that Article 370 ceases to exist in exercise of the power under Article 370(3). 424. The Explanation to Article 370 at the time of the adoption of the Constitution stated that the Maharaja of the State shall be the Government of the State for the purposes of the provision. The President issued CO 44 in exercise of the power under Article 370(3) upon the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly to amend the Explanation to Article 370. In the amended Explanation to Article 370, Government of the State meant the Sadar-i-Riyasat. The President then issued CO 1965 in exercise of power under Article 370(1)(b) by which Article 367 (the interpretation provision) was amended in its application to Jammu and Kashmir. A provision was added to Article 367 that reference to Sadar-i-Riyasat in the Explanation to Article 370 shall mean the Governor. The petitioners in Damnoo (supra) challenged the CO on the ground that it brought an amendment of Article 370 in exercise of the power under Article 370(1)(d) instead of Article 370(3). It was argued that Article 370 can only be amended through Article 370(3) by constituting a fresh constituent assembly or through Article 368. 425. This Court while rejecting the argument of the petitioner observed that the Explanation only recognised the constitutional position as it existed in the State. This Court observed that the Governor, similar to the Sadar-i- Riyasat, is the head of the State and though the Governor is not elected as was the Sadar-i-Riyasat, he exercises the power under the aid and advice of the Government of the State. Hence, the “fundamental character of representative government” is not altered. 426. The of the Constitution Bench in Damnoo (supra) holds that the fundamental character of representative democracy underlines the provisos to Article 370(1)(d) and 370(1)(b) by which the concurrence and consultation of the Government of the State is required before the 248 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. President issues an expanding the legislative powers of the Union in the State or applying the provisions of the Constitution of India to Jammu and Kashmir. As discussed in the preceding section of this , the power under Article 370(1)(b) and 370(1)(d) could only be exercised with the collaboration between the Union and the State.
