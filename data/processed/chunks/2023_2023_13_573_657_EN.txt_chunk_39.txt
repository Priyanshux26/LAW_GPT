84. When the assessee itself vide a letter dated 18.03.2015 (refer to in para 6.4 at page 95 of in original dated 16.07.2018) has intimated that the product manufactured by it was ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’. The stand or change of the nomenclature by the assessee contending that it is only ‘chewing tobacco’ is completely misplaced for three reasons namely: (1) there was no change in the manufacturing process of both the items and the product was claimed to be ‘chewing tobacco’ containing the same ingredients as that of ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’; (2) The declaration was fi led by assessee as ‘scented zarda/jarda tobacco’ up till 27.04.2015; (3) The duty payable had been determined on the basis of the deemed capacity of production under Rule 6(2) of the CTPM Rules. 85. On omission of Compounded Levy Scheme vide Act No. 14 of 2001 Section 3A of the CE Act, was again inserted by Act 18 of 2008, hence ‘chewing tobacco’ was notifi ed under Section 3A by Notifi cation No. 10 of 2010 dated 27.02.2010. From time to time, several Notifi cations were issued increasing rate of duty for ‘chewing tobacco’, unmanufactured COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. AHMEDABAD v. M/S URMIN 625 PRODUCTS P. LTD. AND OTHERS [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] tobacco. Notifi cation No. 4 of 2015 dated 01.03.2015 was issued notifying the deemed capacity of production per packing machine per month, on the same day on which Notifi cation No. 5/2015 was issued. Subsequently, by Notifi cation No. 25/2015 dated 30.04.2015 came to be issued under which the rate of duty per packing machine per month was notifi ed which was based on packing speed. The diff erential duty between ‘chewing tobacco’ and ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was not only vast but also huge. The following table is the mirror to this fact: Period ‘Chewing ‘Zarda/ Relevant Tobacco’ Jarda Scented Notifi cation Tobacco’ P r i o r t o Same Same 01.03.2015 w.e.f. 01.03.2015 38.64 lakhs per 27.05 lakhs per Notification packing machine packing machine No. 04/2015- per month per month CE (N.T.) dt. 01.03.2015 w.e.f. 30.04.2015 38.64 lakhs per 82.11 lakhs per Notification No. packing machine packing machine 25/2015 CE dated per month per month 30.04.2015 86. Hence, the assessee who had taken a stand by its communication dated 18.03.2015 was manufacturing ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ changed its version and started contending the product manufactured by it is ‘chewing tobacco’. The assessee was changing the classifi cation of its product, as the central excise duty on ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ and ‘chewing tobacco’ was changing. The view taken by adjudicating authority is based on factual evaluation which derives its support from the CRCL Report which confi rmed that the samples drawn has the same ingredients as that of ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ and thereby rightly confi rmed the duty demanded under the Show Cause Notice. The fi ndings recorded by us in Group No. 1 in matter of M/s Urmin Products with regard to classifi cation would squarely be applicable to the facts on hand and as such both these appeals deserved to be allowed by setting aside the impugned of the tribunal.
