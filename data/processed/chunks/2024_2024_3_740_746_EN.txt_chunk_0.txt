State of Karnataka v. State of Uttarakhand (2013) 11 SCC 673 relied upon – Reference to observations in Randheer Singh v. State of U.P. (2021) 14 SCC 626 regarding misuse of criminal proceedings as a weapon of harassment and also Usha Chakraborty & Anr. v. State of West Bengal & Anr. 2023 SCC OnLine SC 90 for exercise of the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 to quash civil disputes cloaked in criminal offence – High Court erred in holding that a prima facie case was made out based on the ground that Appellants’ intention to cheat Respondent No.2 from the beginning was evident from the fact that the Appellants had cumulatively paid Respondent No.2 an amount much higher than what the latter was entitled to receive for the services rendered by him – Additional amount paid in light of the settlement, cannot be presumed as an act of cheating – Nature of dispute in present case is civil and allegation of a coerced settlement is unlikely – No FIR or Complaint by Respondent No.2 alleging coercion, amount also duly accepted by him – Mere breach of contract would not attract criminal prosecution in every case, Sarabjit Kaur v. State of Punjab and Anr.
