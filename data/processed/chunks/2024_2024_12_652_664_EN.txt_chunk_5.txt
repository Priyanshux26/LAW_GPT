There is long delay of about ten months in pursuing the case. Date of accident [2024] 12 S.C.R. 659 Geeta Dubey & Ors. v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors. i.e. 18.06.2018 is not disputed, date of taking statements on 20.04.2019 is also not disputed. There is a long gap often months in between. Thus, when all these aspects are taken into consideration and also the fact that claimants never sought any investigation in regard to the CCTV footage or production of CCTV footage to prove the aspect of accident taking place from the vehicle which has been implicated in the present case i.e. truck bearing No. MP19-HA-1197, impugned award having being passed on misplaced sympathy and inappropriate appreciation of evidence available on record cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. Accordingly, impugned award is set aside. Appeal is allowed and disposed of.” 16. We are surprised that in a First Appeal filed under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the High Court has made a short shrift of the matter and by a summary reversed the detailed award passed by the MACT. An appeal under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act is in the nature of the First Appeal. In our considered view, the least that is expected is a careful marshalling of the oral and documentary evidence produced before the MACT. Except for a fleeting reference to the evidence of PW-2, there is no real discussion on the substance of his deposition. What is matter of concern is that there is no reference at all to Exh.P-1 final report, Exh.P-2 the First Information Report, Exh.P-16 the seizure memo of the vehicle after the issuance of Section 133 notice under the Motor Vehicles Act and also no discussion on the findings of the MACT. 17. It is well settled by several pronouncements of this Court that an appeal under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act, is essentially in the nature of the first appeal like Section 96 of the Civil Procedure Code. It has been held by this Court that the High Court is under a legal obligation to decide all issues both on facts and law after appreciating the entire evidence. [See Sudarsan Puhan vs. Jayanta Ku. Mohanty and Others (2018) 10 SCC 552, Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation vs. Mamta and Others (2016) 4 SCC 172 and National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Naresh Kumar and Others (2000) 10 SCC 158]. This is a fortiori when the High Court proposes to reverse the well-reasoned award. 660 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 18. We were initially considering whether the matter should be remanded for fresh consideration by the High Court. However, since the incident is of the year 2018, and already 6 years had elapsed, we felt that any further delay will only compound the agony of the already devastated family. Hence, we have proceeded to analyse the facts ourselves. 19. Except for a bare assertion that the vehicle has been wrongly involved, the insurance company which has setup a plea of collusion has done nothing to make good its case.
