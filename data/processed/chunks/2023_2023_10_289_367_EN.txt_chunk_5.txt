[Paras 50,51, 53 and 55][340-C, C D; 341-E-G; 342-C-D] 2. Pursuant to the merger of Sikkim with India by virtue of which, Sikkim has become one of the States of India and all Sikkim Subjects and all Sikkimese domiciled in the territory of Sikkim have become Indian citizens, there cannot be a discrimination D vis-à-vis Sikkimese women marrying a non-Sikkimese individual, whether an Indian citizen or a foreigner, that too, on or after 1st April, 2008. Such discrimination, is therefore, in violation of the guarantee of equality provided under Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India as it is on the basis of sex and race. Hence, the proviso to clause (26AAA) of Section 10 of the I.T. Act, 1961, E is a stark example of an unconstitutional sex-based discrimination and is liable to be struck down. [Para 56][342-D-F] 3. The proviso runs counter to the Explanation and is thus manifestly arbitrary. This is because the Explanation intends to give the benefit of Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 to all F Sikkimese who are defined under the said Explanation as those ‘individuals’ whose names have been recorded and registered in the Register of Sikkim Subjects immediately before 26th April, 1975 or included pursuant to the Government of India No. 26030/36/90/I.C.I. dated 7th August, 1990 and of even G number dated 8th April, 1991, or those persons whose names do not appear in the Register of Sikkim Subjects but it has been established that the name of such individual’s father or husband or paternal grandfather or brother from the same father had been recorded in that Register. Hence, the benefit of the Explanation must be extended to all Sikkimese women, irrespective of whether H 296 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A they have married a Sikkimese or a non-Sikkimese after the 1st April, 2008. Thus the proviso to Clause (26AAA) of Section 10 of the I.T. Act, 1961 is struck down as being in violation of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India. [Paras 64 and 65][352-H; 353-A-C] 4. The Explanation restricts the exemption only to those B Sikkimese individuals who fall within the three clauses of the Explanation, as the object and purpose of the exemption is only to exempt the settlers in Sikkim or persons domiciled in Sikkim in terms of the 1961 Regulation or the Government s referred to above. Even though the 1961 Regulation has been C repealed, nevertheless, the Register of Sikkim Subjects which is maintained under the said Regulation, which had acquired a sanctity, has been the basis for grant of an exemption and particularly in the form of clause (iii) of the Explanation to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961. This would imply that all those individuals who fall outside the scope and ambit of the Explanation D would not be granted the exemption. Then, the questions of discrimination against persons such as the petitioners and others similarly situated would arise. Individuals having become citizens of India and were domiciled in Sikkim as on 26th April, 1975 are also entitled to the benefit of registration and exemption.
