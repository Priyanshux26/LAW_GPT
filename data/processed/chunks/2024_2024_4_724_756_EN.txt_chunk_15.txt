We are of the view that the failure of the insured to disclose the policy of insurance obtained earlier in the proposal form entitled the insurer to repudiate the claim under the policy.” 35. However, the aforesaid is distinguishable from the present case, insofar as there is no admission by the appellant herein of any previous policies taken by the insured. In that case, after the admission by the policy holder, the Court was tasked only with the question of whether the fact about previous polices qualified to be a “material fact” that was suppressed. However, in the present case, in light of Section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1938, the burden rests on the insurer to prove before the Court that the insured had suppressed the information about the previous policies. This burden of proof has to be duly discharged by the insurer in accordance with the law of evidence. 36. In the instant case, NCDRC has extracted from the letter dated 31.12.2011, by which the claim of the appellant was repudiated, and has relied upon the reply filed by respondent company before the District Forum wherein details of as many as fifteen insurance policies taken from various insurers, other than the policy taken from the respondent company, have been given as under: Sl.

A mere perusal of the aforesaid table would indicate that the date of birth declared are different and the date of issuance has not been stated except in respect of one policy. It is also not known from the table to whom the said policies were issued. However, the NCDRC has observed that the appellant-complainant had not alleged in her complaint that no other insurance policy had been taken by the deceased. In the affidavit of the complainant, the fact that insurance policies were taken from other insurers was not denied. The respondent insurance company had given details of the aforesaid policies by way of an affidavit. Therefore, NCDRC concluded that deceased insured had withheld information in respect of several insurance policies which he had taken from other insurers.
