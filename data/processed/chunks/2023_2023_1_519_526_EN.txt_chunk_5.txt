Assessors opine that the children were looking apparently well and were having their lunch. Symptoms reported did not match with the records. The children said they were not given medicines though the case files recordedIV fluids and medicines being given. When the E assessors revisited this ward at 5 o’clock, nearly all patients admitted on 14.01.2022 were not found in the ward. At 5.00 p.m. the orthopedics ward had no patients who were admitted in the morning for physiotherapy. VI. Census reports of medical, surgical, pediatric and orthopedic wards had even more serious errors. Daily census reports F were entered using pencil. The census report of obstetrics and gynecology ward in the last five days had new admissions ranging between three and thirteen. However, on 14.01.2022, there were already 32 admissions till 5 p.m. In admission list of 14.01.2022 at 11.30 a.m. there were no G contact details of the patients with numbers like 1111111111, 6666666666, etc., suggesting that the patients were not genuine.” 11. Notwithstanding the above deficiencies, the High Court, while upholding the withdrawal of the permission to admit 50 students, permitted the Medical College to continue with the admission of 100 students. This H 526 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A was stayed by this Court on 8 April 2022. Once the of the High Court permitting the Medical College to admit 100 students for 2021-22 was stayed, the Medical College could not have unilaterally chosen to proceed with the admission process. This is plainly in breach of the directions of this Court. The Medical College has made an attempt to overreach the process of the Court. The subsequent inspection B conducted in pursuance of the interim of this Court did not entitle the Medical College to take the law for granted. It plainly acted in defiance of the of this Court. 12. The position as it obtains at present is that the Medical College was permitted to admit 100 students following the inspection which took place and it has accordingly admitted 100 students for the subsequent C academic year. 13. The issue which now remains is as regards the admission which was granted to 100 students for 2021-22 in breach of the of stay passed by this Court. On one hand, the Court has due regard to the consequences which will be faced by the students if their admissions D are disturbed, at this stage. Equally, the sanctity of the judicial process has to be observed. We are, therefore, of the considered view in the exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution that the admissions which were granted to 100 students for 2021-22 should not be disturbed conditional on the Medical College depositing an amount of Rs 2.5 crores within a period of four weeks. The amount shall be E deposited with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and a proof of receipt shall be furnished both to the appellants and to the Registry of this Court. The amount, upon deposit, shall be utilized at the discretion of the Director, AIIMS for meeting the requirements of poor and needy patients.
