The Union announced duty exemption schemes as well. One among these was the AA. To regulate and guide the procedure to be followed for implementing the provisions of the FTP and the rules framed thereunder, the Director General of Foreign Trade (“DGFT”) notified D the HBP, chapter 4 of which prescribed the procedure for availing duty exemption / remission schemes.

The GST regime was introduced with effect from 01.07.2017. However, no amendment was made to Notification No. 18 / 2015-Customs with respect to IGST and compensation cess, resulting in the collection F of these levies for the inputs imported into India against AAs. 4.
