It is correct to be said that the 2nd schedule property is bought by Rahmath Beevi. It is correct to be said that she bought 18 feet South - North. It is correct to be said that the East - West road is on the South of the South Mall to the 1st schedule property.” The deed of conveyance executed by Ameenal Beevi in favour of Rahmath Beevi, the copy of which has been annexed at page 38 of the same counter-affi davit also describes the schedule of the property sold to the latter as:- “1st Schedule Sale Property Tenkasi Reg. Dist, Kadayanallur Sub Regr., Kadayanallur village, 23rd Ward, Town Municipality, in the 1st, 11th No. Road Street, New Ward No. 11, Street No.1, the plot on the east side, the boundaries are: East of 11th No. Main Road; West of my own plot; north of Abdul Khader Muhaideen’s plot; South of my own site; within these 15 feet on the East-West side, 18 feet on the South- North, the plot of 270 sq.ft, in S.No. 59 to 61. The value is Rs.14,850/-” 170 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. Thus, we are of the opinion that the second scheduled property in Rahmath Beevi’s plaint showing measurement of 15 feet (east-west) and 18 feet (north-south) is the correct measurement thereof. Therefore, we do not fi nd any reason not to accept this measurement. 8. The other points of law that we shall address now is on the question of validity of notice under Section 106 of the 1882 Act and whether the petitioners were entitled to protection of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act or not. The High Court found both the points in favour of the predecessor of the respondents. It has been held by the High Court:- “14….It is not in dispute that the fi rst schedule property in both the suits are one and the same. The second schedule property is shown with the measurements 15x15 ft. in O.S.No.172 of 1995, whereas, according to the plaintiff in O.S.464 of 1995, it is 15x18. The fi rst defendant claimed that he entered into a lease deed with Ameenal Beevi as regards second schedule property vide Ex.A2 on 20.03.1985 and he made permanent construction over it and that he has been paying rent to the in respect of the said property to the sons of Ameenal Beevi and therefore, according to him, he is entitled to the protection under City Tenants Protection Act. While so, it is pertinent to note that the plaintiff purchased the second schedule property from the original owner Ameenal Beevi by way of sale deed dated 30.05.1995 under Ex.A1 and after purchase, she issued quit notice dated 1.10.1995 under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act to the defendants 1 and 2. It is also pertinent to note that the fi rst defendant has purchased the fi rst schedule property from Ameenal Beevi, in respect of which, he claimed declaration of title, which was rightly granted by the trial Court.
