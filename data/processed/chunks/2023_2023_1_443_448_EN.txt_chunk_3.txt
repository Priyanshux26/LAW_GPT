However, it is required to be noted that even on merits also, this Court considered and accepted the sale instances produced on behalf of the land owners ranging between 2007 and 2008. Therefore, as such determination of the compensation at Rs. 2,38,00,000/ - per acre with respect to the land acquired vide notification issued on 25.01.2008 can be said to be the base and considering the time gap D between 2008 notification and 2010 notification, a suitable enhancement ranging between 8% to 15 % is given which is held to be permissible as per the catena of decisions of this Court right from the decision in the case of Pehlad Ram Vs. HUDA; (2014) 14 SCC 778 up to the recent decision of this Court in the case of Ramrao Shankar Tapase (supra). E However, at the same time considering the fact that in the present case with respect to the very village, the acquisition proceedings came to be initiated in the month of January, 2008, it will not be safe and/or prudent to grant the cumulative increase of 12%. In the facts and circumstances of the case and even considering the sale instances produced on record, we are of the opinion that if instead of 12% enhancement on Rs. F 2,38,00,000/-, 10% increase is accepted it can be said to be a just compensation and it may meet the ends of justice. 7. In that view of the matter, the market value of the land in question for the lands acquired vide notification dated 13.01.2010 will be at Rs. 2,87,98,000/- per acre. G 8.
