It was only the appellant-Bank that denied the issuance of the sale certificate, first on the pretext that the guarantor had filed Writ Petition No. 12390 of 2018 challenging the e-auction notice dated 17.03.2018 and had obtained a stay on 18.04.2018. Secondly, the appellant-Bank on 08.03.2018 had made a complaint to the CBI and that ED took suo moto cognizance whereby an advisory was issued to the appellant-Bank not to release the original property documents and that the same be kept in safe custody of the bank till further directions of the ED. 10. The appellant-Bank issued e-auction Notice on 17.03.2018 after it had already made the complaint to the CBI but this aspect of the matter was not disclosed in the advertisement. Thus, a conscious decision 2 In short “CBI” 3 In short “ED” 1376 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports was taken by the appellant-Bank to go ahead with the e-auction despite there being a complaint to the CBI. It is subsequent to the complaint to the CBI that the e-auction notice was issued and the e-auction was conducted on 10.04.2018 which was also confirmed in favour of the respondents. In such a situation it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant-Bank to take shelter on the basis of the complaint made to the CBI and to deny issuance of the sale certificate, particularly when there was no specific direction either of the CBI or the ED not to confirm the auction sale or to issue the sale certificate. The only rider was to keep the property documents in safe custody. The respondents, on the other hand, never insisted for the release or the handing over of the property documents rather submitted that they would not create any third-party interest in the property auctioned and that the original documents of the property would be collected by them, subsequently on the consent and clearance from the CBI and ED. In the light of such a stand taken by the respondents on affidavit, the appellant-Bank apparently was not justified in refusing to issue sale certificate to the respondents on the pretext that there was an advisory from the ED. It is worth noticing that even the advisory of ED dated 08.06.2018 is not material for not accepting the balance sale consideration within the period of 15 days stipulated in the sale confirmation letter dated 10.04.2018 which period expired on 25.04.2018, much before the issuance of the above advisory. The respondents were not responsible either for the delay in depositing or non-acceptance of the balance auction amount by the appellant-Bank. 11. As far as the filing of Writ Petition No. 12390 of 2018 by one of the guarantors is concerned, an interim stay was passed therein on 18.04.2018 by which time the auction had already taken place and confirmed. The said writ petition was ultimately dismissed on 18.07.2018 and as such the interim stay ceased to exist. The interim stay granted therein was of no effect insofar as the issuance of sale certificate to the respondents was concerned as the sale had already taken place and stood confirmed before the passing of the interim stay therein.
