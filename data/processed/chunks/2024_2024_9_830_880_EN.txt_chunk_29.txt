It further noted that such abandonment is always a question of intention. 17.3 Further, in State of Punjab vs. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar (2011) 14 SCC 770, this Court dealt with the doctrine of waiver. It held that, to constitute waiver, the person who is said to have waived, must have intentionally abandoned his rights with full knowledge after being fully informed of his rights. 18. In the following Writ Petitions by the impugned dated 18.12.2018 the Bombay High Court observed as follows and dismissed the Writ Petitions on the ground of delay and laches. “(i) WP No.1898 of 2009 – Kukreja Construction and Others vs. The State of Maharashtra and Others. 35. In Writ Petition No.1898/2009, the petitioners’ land was reserved for 18.3 meters wide DP Road. The [2024] 9 S.C.R. 873 Kukreja Construction Company & Others v. State of Maharashtra & Others petitioners surrendered the reserved land and were granted TDR in lieu of the reserved land. Thereafter, the petitioners constructed DP Road as claimed in the petition and a completion certificate was issued on 19th August 1994. According to the case of the petitioners, they carried out work of storm water drain for which competition certificate was issued 17th March 2003. According to their case, the TDR in respect of the land was issued on 16th March 1994 and 5th April 2003. On 21st July 2003, the petitioners through their Architect applied for grant of additional TDR under clause (6) of Appendix-VII. But the application made by the petitioner (Exhibit-I) shows that on 21st July 2003, only 25% additional TDR was claimed in respect of amenity of DP Road. It is not the case of the petitioners that thereafter they followed the said application by issuing reminders. For six years or more, no claim was made for 100% TDR on account of construction of the amenity. However, on 28th August 2009, through their Architect, the petitioners applied for grant of additional TDR for the amenity equivalent to 100% of the area. The said application was made only after the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (supra) and the present petition was lodged on 15th September 2009. Therefore, in facts of the case, no relief can be granted as for a period of more than six years after surrender, no claim was made for 100% TDR. (ii) WP No.1823 of 2009 – Jitendra Amritlal Sheth vs. State of Maharashtra and Others. 37. Now, we come to Writ Petition No.1823/2012. In this case, the possession of DP Road after its construction was handed over by the petitioners to the Municipal Corporation on 5th March 2005. On 24th February 2009, the petitioners’ Architect for the first time applied for 100% FSI in lieu of the constructed amenity. There was inaction for more than 3 years and 874 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 11 months and claim for 100% additional TDR was not made. The averments made in the petition show that on 18th November 2009, a reminder was issued.
