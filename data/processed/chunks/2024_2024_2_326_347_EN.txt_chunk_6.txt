(ii) It is urged that the original plaintiff (Gopalakrishnan) lacked a cause of action. Since the suit was filed while Pounammal was alive, even if his right is termed as ‘vested’, the same does not become enforceable till her death. In other words, till 2004 no right stood accrued in favour of the plaintiff. Reference 8 [1950] 1 SCR 852 9 [2011] 14 SCR 472 : (2011) 12 SCC 695 336 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports was made to Fateh Bibi v. Char̥an Dass (3-Judge Bench)10. Further, upon such rights having accrued, no application to amend the plaint was filed. Any which way, if he had by amendment, sought the relief of possession, it would be as if an entirely new cause of action is sought to be introduced amounting to substitution, which ought not to be allowed. Reference was made to M/s Ganesh Trading Co. v. Moji Ram (2-Judge Bench)11. (iii) As per Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 196312 the declaration of a right or status is a matter of discretion. However, the proviso restricts the application of such discretion in terms that it is not to be exercised when the complainant seeks only a declaration of title when he is able to seek further relief. Reference is made to Ram Saran & Anr. v. Ganga Devi (3-Judge Bench)13, Vinay Krishna v. Keshav Chandra & Anr. (3-Judge Bench)14 and UOI v. Ibrahim Uddin (2-Judge Bench)15. (iv) It is submitted that Article 65 Explanation (a) read with Section 27 of the Limitation Act, 1963 hits the right of Gopalkrishnan. Succession to the estate only accrues on the death of the life estate holder which was in 2004. Till date, no suit stands filed. The learned senior counsel relied on Goplakrishna (Dead) Through LRs v. Narayanagowda(Dead) Through LRs(2- Judge Bench)16. (v) It is argued that the right of Saroja created as per the First Settlement Deed was in fact a contingent interest. It states that if Munusamy has a male heir then one half will belong to him and Saroja will get the other half after the life of Raghavulu and Munusamy. Therefore, on her death in 1951, her interest was spes successionis i.e. it did not achieve concrete form and is only an expectation of succeeding. The contingency 10 [1970] 3 SCR 953 : (1970) 1 SCC 658 11 [1978] 2 SCR 614 : (1978) 2 SCC 91 12 “SRA, 1963” 13 (1973) 2 SCC 60 14 (1993) Supp 3 SCC 129 15 [2012] 8 SCR 35 : (2012) 8 SCC 148 16 [2019] 6 SCR 382 : (2019) 4 SCC 592 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 337 Vasantha (Dead) Thr. Lr. v. Rajalakshmi @ Rajam (Dead) Thr.Lrs. upon which Saroja’s interest rests is two-fold; Munusamy either having or not having children. If he does, they would get half share; if he doesn’t then two eventualities exist: half of Munusamy’s share goes to Saroja upon his death, and the other half after the life interest of Pavunammal is exhausted, goes to Saroja, the remainder woman.
