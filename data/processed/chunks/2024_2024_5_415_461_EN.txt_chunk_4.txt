[Paras 22, 23, 28] Doctrines – Doctrine of res judicata – Civil Procedure Code, 1908 – s.11 – “public right” in Explanation VI – Applicability to public interest litigations: Held: Per Dipankar Datta, J. Doctrine of res judicata is applicable to writ petitions under Article 32 and Article 226 as well – The inclusion of the term “public right” in Explanation VI of s.11 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 aims to avoid redundant legal disputes concerning public rights – Thus, there is no room for debate regarding the application of s.11 to matters of public interest litigation presented through writ petitions – Principle of res judicata is not rigid in cases of substantial public interest and Constitutional Courts are empowered to adopt a flexible approach in such cases, acknowledging their far-reaching public interest ramifications – However, this standard is applicable only when substantial evidence is presented to validate the irreversible harm or detriment to the public good resulting from the action impugned – Court must come to the conclusion that the petition raises substantial grounds not previously addressed in litigation – Only then it may consider such a petition; otherwise, it is within its authority to dismiss it at the threshold – This issue at hand of doubting the efficacy of the EVMs has been previously raised before this Court and it is imperative that such issue is concluded definitively now.
