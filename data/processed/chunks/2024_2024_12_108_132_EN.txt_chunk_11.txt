xxx xxx xxx 47. It is only in the very limited category of cases, where there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is ex facie time-barred, or that the dispute is non-arbitrable, that the court may decline to make the reference. However, if there is even the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the disputes to arbitration, otherwise it would encroach [2024] 12 S.C.R. 125 Aslam Ismail Khan Deshmukh v. Asap Fluids Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. upon what is essentially a matter to be determined by the tribunal. 48. Applying the law to the facts of the present case, it is clear that this is a case where the claims are ex facie time-barred by over 5½ years, since Nortel did not take any action whatsoever after the rejection of its claim by BSNL on 4-8-2014. The notice of arbitration was invoked on 29-4-2020. There is not even an averment either in the notice of arbitration, or the petition filed under Section 11, or before this Court, of any intervening facts which may have occurred, which would extend the period of limitation falling within Sections 5 to 20 of the Limitation Act. Unless, there is a pleaded case specifically adverting to the applicable section, and how it extends the limitation from the date on which the cause of action originally arose, there can be no basis to save the time of limitation. 49. The present case is a case of deadwood/no subsisting dispute since the cause of action arose on 4-8-2014, when the claims made by Nortel were rejected by BSNL. The respondent has not stated any event which would extend the period of limitation, which commenced as per Article 55 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act (which provides the limitation for cases pertaining to breach of contract) immediately after the rejection of the final bill by making deductions.” (Emphasis supplied) 34. This very Bench in Arif Azim Company Limited v. Aptech Limited reported in (2024) 5 SCC 313 was concerned with the following two issues while deciding an application for the appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 – first, whether the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable to an application for appointment of arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996? ; and second, whether the Court may decline to make a reference under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 where the claims are ex-facie and hopelessly time barred. 35. On the first issue in Arif Azim (supra), it was observed that Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 would be covered by Article 137 of 126 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the Limitation Act, 1963 which prescribes a limitation period of 3 years from the date when the right to apply accrues. The limitation period for filing an application seeking appointment of an arbitrator was held to commence only after a valid notice invoking arbitration had been issued by one of the parties to the other party and there had been either a failure or refusal on the part of the other party to comply with the requirements of the said notice.
