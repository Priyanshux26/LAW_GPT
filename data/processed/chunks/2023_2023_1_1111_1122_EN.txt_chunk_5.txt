It is contended that if any payment would have been made during the mortarium period the same would have been in breach of the provisions of the IBC. It is submitted F that as per the Resolution Plan accepted during the insolvency proceedings, the Resolution Applicant was required to deposit all statutory dues (including service tax dues) within 6 months from the effective date into an escrow account. That as per the Resolution Plan, payment to escrow account shall be treated as effective payment to the relevant G Operational Creditors. It is further contended that in this case, effective date is 24.07.2020, the date on which the Resolution Plan was approved by the NCLT. So, Service Tax dues along with other statutory dues were deposited in an escrow account on 08.01.2021 before the expiry of the period of six months. It is accrued that this Hon’ble Court in the case of Principal Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Monnet Ispat H 1118 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A & Energy Ltd., (2018) 18 SCC 786 has held that once a moratorium has been enforced, any existing proceeding against the debtor shall stand prohibited. In this regard, it is submitted that the IBC shall have precedence over any inconsistent statutes. 3.4 It is vehemently submitted that in any case, no person can be B left remediless due to operation of law. That in the present case, the moratorium period under the IBC was extended from 11.09.2018 to 24.07.2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and non-functioning of the NCLT. It is contended that even otherwise, the appellant could not have made any payment during the mortarium period by operation of law and inability to make the payment was owning to the moratorium imposed C under the provisions of the IBC. It is urged that therefore, the appellant may not be left remediless when the application under the Scheme 2019 was submitted and processed within time. In support of her above submissions and the relief prayed, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has heavily relied upon the decisions of this Court in the D case of Sunil Vasudeva vs. Sundar Gupta, (2019) 17 SCC 385 (para 31), United Air Travel Services vs. Union of India, (2018) 8 SCC 141 (para 13) and Union of India vs. Asish Agarwak, (2022) SCC Online SC 543 (para 23). 3.5 It is reiterated submitted that the appellant could not make the E payment due to legal disability and no one can be expected to do the impossible. Reliance is placed on the decisions of this Court in the case of Gyanichand vs. State of Andhra Pradesh, (2016) 15 SCC 164 (para 11) and Calcutta Iron Merchants Association vs. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, (1997) 8 SCC 42 (para 5). 3.6 It is submitted that the appellant cannot be prejudiced and/or F made to suffer for no fault of the appellant.
