118 Gandhi Faiz-e-am-College, supra note 99, para 16. 1844 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the provision is salutary and saved, being not a diktat eroding the freedom of the freedom.” [Emphasis Supplied] 183. Notably, for such administration to lie with the community, it is not enough if the decisions are taken by a member of such a community. If these decisions lie with the community but there is an outside authority with the power to change these decisions, it would imply that the minority community does not have pervasive control over the administrator,and its status is merely that of a paper tiger.119 Conversely, if there are outside authorities and the minority community does not have the power to oversee or reverse the decisions of such authorities, it would again imply that control lies externally. In other words, the administration shall cover both the active and the reactive aspects, such that the minority community can take active steps to effect changes in the institution without outside restriction and can also veto decisions taken or changes made from the outside. 184. Consequently, in to satisfy the requirements of Article 30, a minority community must retain both de jure and de facto control over the institution. It is insufficient for the community to simply have a minority member appointed by the majority for administrative roles; this does not confer genuine control. If the minority member’s position can be revoked at any time by the majority, the real power of administration does not lie with the minority community. Allowing Article 30 protection under such circumstances would create legal unpredictability, as non-minority institutions could temporarily appoint minority members to exploit the benefits. To meet the administration test, the minority community must therefore first have visible de jure control over the institution. 185. Similarly, mere de jure control over the institution may not be sufficient on its own. It is possible that, to secure protection under Article 30, a minority community might be nominally granted administrative power while actual control is exercised behind the scenes by individuals outside the community. Such a scenario would amount to a façade of minority administration, failing to satisfy the test of genuine physical 119 Lilly Kurian, supra note 111. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1845 Aligarh Muslim University v. Naresh Agarwal & Ors. control over the management. Thus, the need arises for both aspects of control over the educational institution. 186. To summarize, the test for administration under Article 30 involves identifying who holds effective and overall control within the institution. While external authorities may assist in its administration, the decisive influence and control must rest with members of the minority community. To meet this test, the minority community must exercise both active and reactive control, ensuring that administrative powers are genuinely held in both de jure and de facto terms. K. Issue VI: Whether the Union of India is obligated to defend the AMU Amendment Act, 1981? 187. Before parting, we would like to fairly acknowledge that both sides to the present dispute, aggressively argued on the issue as to whether the UOI could be allowed to change its stance and challenge its own statute.
