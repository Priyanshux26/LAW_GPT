(2) Every made under this section shall be laid before each House of Parliament.” (emphasis supplied) Para 2(13) of the , 2019 “2. Removal of difficulties. —The difficulties arising in giving effect to the provisions of the principal Act have been removed in the following manner, namely— xxx xxx xxx (13) The Acts repealed in the manner provided in Table 3 of the Fifth Schedule, shall not affect— (a) the previous operation of any law so repealed or anything duly done or suffered there under; (b) any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any law so repealed; (c) any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any law so repealed; or [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1069 National Investigation Agency New Delhi v. Owais Amin @ Cherry & Ors. (d) any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid, and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if this Act had not been passed.” (emphasis supplied) 22. Section 103 of the Act, 2019 confers power upon the President of India to remove any difficulty that might arise in giving effect to the provisions of the Act, 2019. It has been conferred, so as to facilitate the application of new laws, which replaced the then existing ones. 23. In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 103 of the Act, 2019, the , 2019 was promulgated on 30.10.2019, with the appointed day being 31.10.2019. It was accordingly introduced after completion of the procedure contemplated under Section 103 of the Act, 2019. 24. Para 2(13) of the , 2019 concerns itself with the circumstances under which the earlier laws would not be affected. It does not merely deal with the previous operation of any law, but also any right, obligation or liability, apart from any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred. Sub-clause (d) of Clause 13 deals with the position qua an investigation in respect of any such right or obligation as mentioned in sub-clauses (a) to (c). However, an addition has been made to the effect that when an investigation, legal proceeding or remedy, for anything done under the old law which is inclusive of CrPC, 1989, the same would continue as if the Act, 2019 had not been passed. It is not only the continuation that has been facilitated, but also the initiation. 25. The aforementioned paragraph not only speaks of a mere right, but also about an obligation. Such an obligation or a right can either be with an individual, or a State, as the case may be. When the State undertakes the exercise of investigating an offence, it does so on behalf of the public. Thus, any investigation in currency at the time of repealing of any statute, as mentioned in Table 3 of the 1070 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Fifth Schedule, followed by the introduction of the Act, 2019, shall continue under CrPC, 1989.
