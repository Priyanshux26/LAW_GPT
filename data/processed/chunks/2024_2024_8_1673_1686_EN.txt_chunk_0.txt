[2024] 8 S.C.R. 1673 : 2024 INSC 1047 Pradhan Babu and Others v. Nachimuthu Nagar Kudiyiruppor Nala Sangam and Others (Civil Appeal No. 5875 of 2023) 28 August 2024 [Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah,* JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the suit land was under any sort of legal encumbrance so as to make it unfit for transfer of right, title and interest thereon in light of the Layout Plan notified by the Deputy Director, Town and Country Planning, Thanjavur region in the year 1978 and later revised in the year 1981. Headnotes† Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1972 – ss.37 and 38 – For a creation of a Nagar various plots were formed by one N – In a Layout plan, a portion of land was earmarked for public purpose for welfare of the residents – That earmarked site is the suit land/property – N died on 29.04.2004 – Appellants case that after the death of N, the suit property was sold by his legal heirs to appellants – The cause of action arose when appellant no.1 started construction of a building on the suit property – Respondents no.1 and 2/original plaintiffs are the office-bearers of the Resident Welfare Association, who filed suit and sought relief of permanent injunction, restraining the defendants from encroaching upon the suit property and putting up construction – Trial Court decreed suit – The First Appellate Court dismissed the suit – However, the High Court restored the and decree of the Trial Court – Correctness: Held: In the case at hand, although the Layout (originally 1978 and revised in 1981) shows that it has been earmarked for a public purpose – However, admittedly, nothing happened thereafter in terms of Section 37 of the Act, namely, neither was the land acquired under land acquisition laws nor any agreement was made with the person(s)/owners – Neither the State Government nor * Author 1674 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Respondent no.3 acted to takeover or gain ownership of the suit property – No steps were taken either by the planning authority or the State Government to acquire the land which as per the Act was required to be done within 3 years from publication – This apart, ultimately in the year 2005, the Layout itself was revised showing it as a mixed residential area – Be that as it may, on the core issue, the original owner of the suit property, never lost right, title, interest and usage therein – The deeming provision under Section 38(b) of the Act would operate to release the suit property, as the 3-year period would have lapsed, latest in 1984, counted from the year of revision i.e., 1981, after the initial Layout in the year 1978 – The original owner, thus, was competent in law to transfer the suit property to any other person on 20.04.2009 (date of the first Sale Deed) – Thus, the suit filed by the respondents had absolutely no cause of action evincible from a reading of the plaint – The First Appellate Court rightly interfered and dismissed the suit – The reasoning given by the Trial Court as well as the High Court, is erroneous, and cannot be sustained.
