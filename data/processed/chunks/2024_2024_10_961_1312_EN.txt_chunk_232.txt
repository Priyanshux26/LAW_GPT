The preamble to the Accord stipulates that the settlement was reached “keeping all aspects of the problem including constitutional and legal provisions, international agreements, national commitments and humanitarian consideration”. On the foreigners issue, the following settlement was arrived at: "5.1 For purposes of detection and deletion of foreigners, 1.1.1966 shall be the base date and year. 5.2 All persons who came to Assam prior to 1.1.1966, including those amongst them whose names appeared on the electoral rolls used in 1967 elections, shall be regularised. 5.3 Foreigners who came to Assam after 1.1.1966 (inclusive) and upto 24th March, 1971 shall be detected in accordance with the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 and the Foreigners (Tribunals) 1964. 5.4 Names of foreigners so detected will be deleted from the electoral rolls in force. Such persons will be required to register themselves before the Registration officers of the respective districts in accordance with the provisions of the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939 and the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1939. 5.5 For this purpose, Government of India will undertake suitable strengthening of the governmental machinery. 5.6 On the expiry of a period of ten year following the date of detection, the names of all such persons which have been deleted from the electoral rolls shall be restored. 126 Arupjyoti Saikia, The Quest for Modern Assam, (Penguin and Allen Lane) 455 127 Ibid, 449 128 Ibid, 489 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1283 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 5.7 All persons who were expelled, earlier, but have since re-entered illegally into Assam, shall be expelled. 5.8 Foreigners who came to Assam on or after March 25, 1971 shall continue to be detected, deleted and expelled in accordance with law. Immediate and practical steps shall be taken to expel such foreigners. 5.9 The Government will give due consideration to certain difficulties expressed by the AASU/AAGSP regarding the implementation of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, 1983.” 71. The provisions of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act are traceable to the Assam Accord. The Assam Accord, as explained above, was a political settlement between the Union of India (‘the executive’) and students groups in Assam. In an Article 14 challenge to a legislative provision, the court must identify the ‘legislative’ objective. The objective, against which this Court must test the validity of the law must be identified based on the circumstances surrounding the Assam Accord and the enactment of the legislation. Section 6A was included with the objective of reducing the influx of migrants to India and dealing with those who had already migrated. The Assam Accord was a political solution to the issue of growing migration and Section 6A was a legislative solution. Section 6A must not be read detached from the previous legislation enacted by Parliament to deal with the problem of influx of migrants of Indian Origin that I have traced in the preceding sections. Section 6A is one more statutory intervention in the long list of legislation that balances the humanitarian needs of migrants of Indian Origin and the impact of such migration on economic and cultural needs of Indian States.
