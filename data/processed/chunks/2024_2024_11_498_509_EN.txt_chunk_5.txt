02 at around 7:30 PM on the date of incident i.e., 16.08.1989. They also acknowledged the fact that Accused No. 02 is related to them and they regularly visited each other’s house and had cordial relations. 15. The factum that the deceased had gone to the house of Accused No. 02 at around 7:30 PM on the date of incident is not disputed as the two children of Accused No. 02 who are PW10-T.K. Ramya and PW11- T.K. Radhesh have also stated in their statement that deceased was present in their house in the evening of 16.08.1989. However, they have added that she had left the house at around 9:00 PM and did not return thereafter. 16. As regards the Appellant, the evidence which has been brought on record by the prosecution to establish his presence in the house of Accused No. 02 is the statement of PW14-K.V. Raman, who had stated that he had seen the Appellant entering the house of Accused No. 02 at around 11:30 PM on the date of incident. PW20-K. Majeed, a taxi driver has been produced by the prosecution, who had stated that he saw the Appellant at 5:30 AM on 17.08.1989 at Parappanangadi bus stand, heading towards the railway station. He further stated that the Appellant was wearing a coffee brown shirt, white spotted lungi and a bath towel was tied around the head. 17. These are the two witnesses who have been produced to establish presence of the Appellant in the house of Accused No. 02 on the date of incident. PW-14 is stated to have seen the Appellant going to the house of Accused No. 02 at 11:30 PM in the night of incident and PW-20 has seen the Appellant leaving the town, the following morning. They are the two witnesses who can be said to be the star witnesses as far as the presence of the Appellant in the house of Accused No. 02 is concerned at the night of incident. 18. Another witness who can be said to be crucial for the prosecution case is PW18-Sirajudheen from whose possession and presence, recovery of a bag allegedly belonging to the Appellant was made 506 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports on 27.08.1989. Blood-stained clothes, a blanket and a head towel belonging to the Appellant are said to have been recovered from this bag. The prosecution claims that these articles belong to the Appellant and the recovery was made on his behest in the presence of PW-18 on 27.08.1989. This witness has actually blown off the lid and falsified the case of prosecution by stating that a police constable visited his shop on 23.08.1989 and took away the bag in question from him. Subsequently, on 27.08.1989 police came in a police jeep and handed him the same bag which was taken from him earlier and opened it, showing articles as stated above, and got his signatures on the prepared Mahazar. It was at this moment he saw the Appellant sitting in the police jeep.
