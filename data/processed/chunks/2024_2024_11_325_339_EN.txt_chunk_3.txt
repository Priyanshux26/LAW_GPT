Aggrieved thereby, 330 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Gireeshkumar T.M. and six others, who held the prescribed Certificates in Data Entry and Office Automation, filed WP (C) No. 23679 of 2023 before the Kerala High Court. Their prayer therein was to quash the KPSC’s ranked list, which included candidates who did not possess the prescribed qualification, and to direct the KPSC to publish a modified ranked list, including only such candidates who had the prescribed qualification. They also sought a declaration that only candidates who had the prescribed qualification were entitled to be appointed as LDCs in the Kerala Water Authority. WP (C) No. 19463 of 2023 was filed on the same lines and with similar prayers by Sajitha S. and three others. It may be noted that, by the date of disposal of these cases, 29 candidates with DCA/higher qualification figured as respondents in WP (C) No. 23679 of 2023, while 72 such candidates were shown as respondents in WP (C) No. 19463 of 2023. 7. Notably, the KPSC filed a counter affidavit taking a position contrary to its earlier stand. According to it, after the Division Bench , selection to the posts of LDC was taken up and an OMR examination was conducted. On the basis of the results thereof, a probability list was published on 03.06.2023 of candidates who had secured 40 marks or above. The KPSC claimed that, as a higher qualification was not barred, it had considered such candidates also while preparing the probability list and those with DCA/higher qualification were also included therein. Reference was made by the KPSC to Rule 10(a) (ii) of the Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1958. 8. A learned Judge of the Kerala High Court noted that the KPSC had changed its stance despite carrying the matter in appeal on the earlier occasion and held that the KPSC could not be permitted to alter its stand, as permitting such reversal of position by it would mean reopening the previously concluded s. The learned Judge was of the opinion that, even if erroneous, an inter-party would bind the parties thereto. The learned Judge, accordingly, allowed the writ petitions on 30.10.2023 and directed the KPSC to recast and rework the ranked list, by excluding candidates who were not qualified, and to publish a modified ranked list by including therein only those candidates who possessed the requisite qualification as prescribed in the Notification dated 16.07.2012. 9. The correctness of this common dated 30.10.2023 was canvassed in Writ Appeal Nos. 1941 and 1945 of 2023 before a [2024] 11 S.C.R. 331 Anoop M. and Others v. Gireeshkumar T.M. and Others Etc. Division Bench of the Kerala High Court. Writ Appeal No. 1941 of 2023 was filed by Rikha Susheel and four candidates, who held DCA/ higher qualifications, while Writ Appeal No. 1945 of 2023 was filed by Rikha Susheel and fifteen such other candidates. All of them had figured as respondents in the two writ petitions. These writ appeals were dismissed, vide common dated 30.01.2024.
