2357 of 2024, appellants discharged – Chargesheet in SLP (Crl.) No.9482/2021 bereft of details and particulars, summoning quashed. [Paras 13, 23, 24, 31, 40, 45] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.173(2), 190, 204, 251 – Chargesheet integral to the process of taking cognisance, summoning of the accused, the issue of notice, framing of charge: Held: There is an inherent connect between the chargesheet submitted under Section 173(2), cognisance which is taken u/s.190, issue of process and summoning of the accused u/s.204, and thereupon issue of notice u/s.251, or the charge in terms of Chapter XVII of the Code – The details set out in the chargesheet have a substantial impact on the efficacy of procedure at the subsequent stages – The chargesheet is integral to the process of taking cognisance, the issue of notice and framing of charge, being the only investigative document and evidence available to the court till that stage – Substantiated reasons and grounds for an offence being made in the chargesheet are a key resource for a Magistrate to evaluate whether there are sufficient grounds for taking cognisance, initiating proceedings, and then issuing notice, framing charges etc. – These provisions, however, have to be read along with the power of the police to investigate under sub-section (8) to s.173 even when they have submitted a report u/sub-section (2) to s.173. [Para 20] Deprecation – Of filing of chargesheets without stating sufficient details of the facts constituting the offense or putting the relevant evidence on record: 88 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: In some states, the chargesheets merely carry a reproduction of the details mentioned by the complainant in the FIR, and then proceed to state whether an offence is made out, or not made out, without any elucidation on the evidence and material relied upon – In the format prescribed for the State of Uttar Pradesh, column 16 requires the investigating officer to state brief facts of the case – State of Uttar Pradesh issued circular stating that the investigation provisions contained in the Code and the police regulations with reference to s.173, CrPC were not consistently complied with and followed by the investigating officers and the supervising officers – The need to provide lead details of the offence in the chargesheet is mandatory as it is in accord with paragraph 122 of the police regulations – Similar directions were issued following the direction of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad that brief narration of the material collected during investigation, which forms the opinion of the investigating officer, should be mentioned in the chargesheet. [Paras 2, 30] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.190, 204 – Cognizance of offences by Magistrates – Issue of process – “cognisance”: Held: It indicates the juncture at which the court or Magistrate takes judicial notice of the offence with a view to initiate proceedings in respect of such an offence – This is different from initiation of proceedings – Rather, it is a condition precedent to the initiation of proceedings by a Magistrate or judge – At this stage, the Magistrate has to keep in mind the averments in the complaint or the police report, and has to evaluate whether there is sufficient ground for initiation of proceedings – This is not the same as the consideration of sufficient grounds for conviction, as whether evidence is sufficient for supporting the conviction or not, can be determined only at the stage of trial, and not at the stage of cognisance – s.204 does not mandate the Magistrate to explicitly state the reasons for issue of summons and this is not a prerequisite for deciding the validity of the summons – Nevertheless, the requirement of the Code is that the summons is issued when it appears to the Magistrate that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused – Magistrate in terms of s.204 is required to exercise his judicial discretion with a degree of caution, even when he is not required to record reasons, on whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding.
