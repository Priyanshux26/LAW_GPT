It is in the backdrop this D Court does not find favour with the submissions of senior counsel appearing for the appellants that the conviction of eight persons based on solitary evidence is not justified, particularly when there is no vagueness in his testimony with respect to the role ascribed to each one of the accused. [Para 21][978-F-H] E 3. The role of PW-24 in drafting the complaint cannot be taken as negative simply because he was an advocate and so he paid attention to detail. PW-1 has stated in his complaint that he does not know how to read and write. The person to whom the role of summoning PW-24 to write the complaint may be attributed or the discrepancy in drafting either on the instructions of PW-1 F or on the basis of the notes prepared by the police is not so stark, keeping in view the limited span of time within which all these activities took place for it to lend credence to the grounds urged in these appeals by special leave petitions with respect to the approach of the Sessions Judge being entirely erroneous or illegal. G The genesis of the prosecution case cannot be said to have been shaken or rendered doubtful. The complaint was alleged to have been drafted by an advocate (PW-24), and not by the petitioner with the help of the police personnel. Does it cast doubt on the prosecution case? In this Court’s considered view, none. For, as H RAVASAHEB @ RAVASAHEBGOUDA ETC. v. STATE OF 967 KARNATAKA this Court has noticed the defence to have admitted their A presence on the spot and the independent witnesses ascribed a specific role to each of the accused. [Para 22][979-A-D] 4. The holding in the landmark Masalti, where four learned judges have held that the prosecution need not prove specific acts to specific persons. With neither the number nor the B presence of the accused being disputed, this Court cannot, within law, hold that the accused have been wrongly convicted by the courts below.
