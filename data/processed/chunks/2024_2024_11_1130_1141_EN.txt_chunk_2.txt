Learned counsel for the defendant contends that the courts below erred in holding that the mortgage deed dated 17.10.1990 was a simple mortgage under Section 58(b) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.1 It is submitted that the mortgage deed was, in fact, a mortgage by conditional sale as per Section 58(c) of the Act, containing a clear stipulation that if the plaintiff failed to repay the mortgage amount along with interest within three years, the mortgage would automatically convert into an absolute sale in favour of the defendant. 7. It is further argued that the plaintiff failed to tender the amount within the agreed period of three years, and therefore, the defendant lawfully became the owner of the suit land. It is emphasized that the terms of the registered mortgage deed were fully explained to the plaintiff, and there is no credible evidence to suggest otherwise. Furthermore, it is submitted that the plaintiff did not personally appear in the witness box to substantiate her claims. Instead, her husband, acting as her power of attorney holder, deposed on her behalf. 8. The learned counsel also contends that Section 165 of the Chhattisgarh Land Revenue Code, 1959,2 does not apply to the present case. It is argued that the suit land is not agricultural land, as residential structures have been constructed on it, and therefore, the restrictions under Section 165 of the Code are inapplicable.
