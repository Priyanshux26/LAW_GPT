No.03/2006, and consequentially, the passed in Writ Petition (Civil) No.12 of 2005 dated 25th July 2005. 29. The questions presented in this appeal are answered as under : 29.1 Clause 4 of the MoS dated 10th April 2002 does not envisage a complete standstill of departmental proceedings as a result of the pendency of criminal proceedings. The position of law is that the stay of the latter is desirable, but the same is to be aff ected only for a reasonable period of time. 29.2 The nature of proceedings being wholly separate and distinct, acquittal in criminal proceedings does not entitle the delinquent employee for any benefi t in the latter or automatic discharge in departmental proceedings. 30. Consequently, Mr. P. Zadenga’s dismissal from service as per the Memorandum dated 28th March 2003 (D.P.S.No.2003/02) is restored. 31. Interlocutory Applications, if any, stand disposed of. 32. Parties to bear their own costs. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Divya Pandey
