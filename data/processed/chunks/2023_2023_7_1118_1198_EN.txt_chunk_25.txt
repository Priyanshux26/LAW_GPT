The present situation, E is identical to the situation that was prevailing in 2017. When the Co-ordinator and Joint Co-ordinator were not in a position to call for the meeting, the members cannot be forced to approach the Court every time, therefore, the power vested on the office-bearers under Rule 20 A (vii) should be exercised for this purpose as exercised for the meeting held on 12.09.2017. F 36. For easy reference, the Bye-Laws of the Political Party is annexed with this judgement. 37. The amendments to the Bye-Laws can happen only at the General Council under Rule 43 of the Bye-Laws. G 38. The General Council Meeting was convened on 11.07.2022 pursuant to the passed by the learned Single Judge in O.A. Nos. 368, 370 and 379 of 2022 and thereafter, by dated 06.07.2022 the Hon’ble Supreme Court in S.L.P. (C) No. 11237 of 2022 has observed as follows: - H 1152 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A “…….b. So far as the Meeting of the General Council of the respondent No. 3, slated to be held on 11.07.2022 is concerned, the same may proceed in accordance with law and in that relation, the other aspects of any interim relief ought to be projected and presented before the learned Single Judge dealing with civil suit(s) on the Original Side….” B 39. The appellant-Co-Ordinator sent a letter dated 28.06.2022 to the Election Commission of India stating that the posts of Co- Ordinator and the Joint Co-Ordinator had lapsed for the reason that the election in the Executive Council Meeting dated 01.12.2021 was not ratified in the General Council Meeting held on 23.06.2022. C From the said letter, it is clear that the appellant-Joint Co-Ordinator has given up his right to continue as Joint Co-Ordinator. Therefore, there is no Joint-Co-Ordinator in the Party after the said letter. The appellant cannot be compelled to continue as Joint Co-Ordinator forever. When the appellant has given up his right to continue as D Joint-Co-Ordinator, the appellant and the 1st respondent in O.S.A. No. 227 of 2022 cannot jointly conduct the General Council Meeting. The commonsenseapproach was followed on 12.09.2017, wherein the General Council Meeting was announced at the instance of the Office Bearers Party Headquarters. The strict compliance of Rule 19(vii) would lead to absurdity. In these E circumstances, the General Council Meeting called for by the Presidium Chairman on 23.06.2022 to convene the Special General Council Meeting on 11.07.2022 is proper. 40. The requisition for the meeting was made by 2190 members out of the 2665 members of the General Council. This amounts to F more than 80% of the General Council members. The requisition was to be made by the members for deciding the issue of the Single Leadership. The requisition was readout to all the members who were present and with their approval, it was handed over to the Chairman of the meeting on the stage in front of the G requisitioners. The requisition was followed with an Agenda being signed and requested by 2432 General Council Members.
