3.3 Before the expiry of the extended period of investigation which was valid until 11.11.2020, the Public Prosecutor moved another application dated 07.11.2020 requesting for further extension of time for investigation for a period of 30 days as per the provisions contained in section 43D (2) (b) of UAPA. The reasons given for moving the said application were manifold which are noted as follows: i) Sanction under section 45(2) of UAPA was awaited from GNCTD. ii) FSL results of arms recovered from accused persons were also awaited; and iii) Sanction under section 39 of the Arms Act was to be obtained. 3.4 The said application was allowed by the Trial Court on 10.11.2020 and the period of investigation was further extended 3 FIR 4 UAPA 5 IPC 6 The Arms Act 7 IO [2024] 1 S.C.R. 77 STATE OF NCT OF DELHI v. RAJ KUMAR @ LOVEPREET @LOVELY till 30.11.2020. In the said of 10.11.2020, although all the reasons mentioned in the application dated 07.11.2020 seeking extension of the period of investigation were mentioned but in the operative portion, the Trial Court noted that the extension had been sought on the ground of obtaining mandatory sanction which was still pending before the GNCT Delhi and had accordingly granted the extension till 30.11.2020. The investigation has since been completed and Police report under section 173(2) CrPC was submitted on 26.11.2020 before the expiry of the period of extension for concluding the investigation up to 30.11.2020. 3.5 The respondent moved an application on 11.11.2020 itself under section 167 of the CrPC for release on bail. The said application was rejected by the Trial Court vide dated 17.11.2020. Aggrieved by the same, the respondent preferred a petition under section 482 CrPC for setting aside the dated 11.09.2020 and 10.11.2020 which was registered as Crl. M.C. No.2312 of 2020. This petition has since been allowed by the impugned giving rise to the present appeal. 4. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we are of the view that the High Court committed an error in allowing the petition and granting default bail to the respondent. In this connection, the High Court had relied upon the in the case of Hitendra Vishnu Thakur and others vs. The State of Maharashtra and others8 wherein this Court was dealing with the provisions of section 20(4) (bb) of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 19879 and had observed that the period for granting extension of investigation could not be extended in a casual manner for reasons other than those mentioned in the above noted provision which stated that it could be for completion of investigation only. 5. Reliance placed upon the said in the case of Hitendra Vishnu Thakur (supra) by the Delhi High Court was misplaced. It was a case relating to TADA, whereas the present case related to UAPA. The provisions under UAPA section 43D(2)(b) are different and give other reasons also for extension of time for investigation. 8 (1994) 4 SCC 602 9 TADA 78 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
