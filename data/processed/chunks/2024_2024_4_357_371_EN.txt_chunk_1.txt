[Paras 19, 21, 22, 27, 29, 31-33, 40] Power of Attorney holder – Appellants relied upon the evidence of their Power of Attorney holder/Manager of the property (PW- 1) to prove their easementary right of way over the disputed rasta – Propriety: Held: Power of Attorney holder can only depose about the facts within his personal knowledge and not about those facts which are not within his knowledge or are within the personal knowledge of the person who he represents or about the facts that may have transpired much before he entered the scene – PW-1, the Power of Attorney holder deposed that he was giving evidence on behalf of plaintiff Nos. 2 to 4 i.e. the Appellants – He was not having [2024] 4 S.C.R. 359 Manisha Mahendra Gala & Ors. v. Shalini Bhagwan Avatramani & Ors. any authority to act as the Power of Attorney of the Appellants at the time his statement was recorded – He was granted Power of Attorney subsequently as accepted by the parties – Therefore, his evidence was completely meaningless to establish that Appellants have acquired or perfected any easementary right over the disputed rasta in 1994 when the suit was instituted. [Para 29] Pleadings – Consideration of: Held: Pleadings should be liberally construed and need not contain the exact language used in the statutory provision but it does not mean that the pleadings even if fails to plead the essential legal requirement for establishing a right, the same be so construed so as to impliedly include what actually has not been pleaded more particularly when it happens to be an essential ingredient for establishing a right – In the present case, the pleadings of the plaintiffs/appellants fall short of meeting the legal requirement of acquiring easementary right through prescription and cannot be treated to be of sufficient compliance of the statutory requirement – A fact which is not specifically pleaded cannot be proved by evidence as evidence cannot travel beyond the pleadings. [Para 23] Easementary right – Claimed under the Sale Deed – Propriety – Appellants claimed that they acquired easementary right under the Sale Deed dated 17.09.1994 (photocopy produced) and that it would not stand extinguished even if the necessity has ceased to exist: Held: Property owned and possessed by the Appellants was originally the property of one ‘RB’ which was acquired by the government – It was purchased by ‘WF’ in public auction from the government – Thereafter, it devolved upon his legal heir ‘JWR’ who sold it to the predecessor-in-interest of the Appellants vide Sale Deed dated 17.09.1994 – There is no evidence on record to establish that the government ever transferred any easementary right over the rasta in question to ‘WF’ or that his legal heir ‘JWR’ ever acquired or perfected any easementary right over it – Therefore, the right which was not possessed by them could not have been transferred to the Appellants under the Sale Deed dated 17.09.1994 – Further, the said Sale Deed dated 17.09.1994 in original was not produced in evidence – It was only the photocopy of the same which was brought on record – Photocopy of a document is inadmissible in evidence – Moreover, the said sale 360 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
