6, 6A, 7 and 11 – s.6A, if ultra vires the Part II – s.6A, if violative of Arts 6, 7 and 11 – Parliament, if had the power to enact s.6A – s.6A, if contradicts s. 5 of the Citizenship Act, which requires every citizen to take an oath of allegiance – s.6A enabling dual citizenship, if unconstitutional for violating Art. 9 – Parliament, if had the competence to specify different conditions u/Art. 11. 964 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: (per Surya Kant, J.) (for himself and for M.M. Sundresh and Manoj Misra, JJ.) s.6A aligns with the fundamental purpose of Arts. 6 and 7, which was to extend citizenship rights to those affected by the country’s partition and is not contrary to them – Art. 6 does not prohibit the granting of citizenship after the cut-off date of 19.07.1948 – It only specifies the fulfilment of certain conditions, which, are also present in s.6A(3) – While s.6A(2) grants deemed citizenship without these conditions, the competence of Parliament to prescribe different conditions is well embedded in Art. 11 – Art.7 prohibits citizenship to people who remigrated to India, this is only a sub-class of people who have been granted citizenship by s.6A – Since s.6A grants citizenship even to people who migrated for the first time, the class of re-migrants is severable from this provision – Art. 11 confers overriding powers upon the Parliament to make laws even when they are against other provisions of Part II and that it grants the Parliament the power to make ‘any’ provision regarding citizenship and that this authority is not restricted by the provisions of Part II – Concept of dual citizenship means one has citizenship of two countries simultaneously – In India, such citizenship is restricted by Art. 9, and s. 9 of the Citizenship Act, and operate in different time spheres and in different fields – Even if it is assumed that s.6A grants dual citizenship, it does not run counter to Art. 9 which restricts a person possessing foreign citizenship from acquiring citizenship u/Arts. 5, 6, and 8 – However, s.6A does not grant citizenship under these provisions and is rather a separate method enacted by Parliament by virtue of its power u/Art.11 – Conflict between Art. 9 and s.6A, thus, does not arise at all – Further, s.6A also does not conflict with s. 9 because s.6A does not override the scheme of s. 9 and must be read complementarily thereto – However, s.6A, presumes the renunciation of previous citizenship – Furthermore, explicit lack of an oath of allegiance before the conferral of citizenship by s.6A does not absolve the immigrants covered under this provision from following the laws of the country, just as any other citizen of India – s.6A cannot be run down on the premise that it does not mandate an oath of allegiance.
