[2023] 13 S.C.R. 1027 : 2023 INSC 1022 CASE DETAILS NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. & ORS. v. M/S. MUDIT ROADWAYS (Civil Appeal No. 339 of 2023) NOVEMBER 24, 2023 [HRISHIKESH ROY AND SANJAY KAROL, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Whether the National Commission was justifi ed in allowing the fi re insurance claim of the insured against the insurance company. Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – Fire insurance claim – Repudiation of – Fire broke out at a insured warehouse – Insured having paid for coverage against fi re and safeguarding the custom bonded goods – Survey and investigations reports – Majority suggesting electric short circuit as the cause and two reports suggesting sparks from rooftop welding work – Repudiation of claim by the Insurance Company – Consumer complaint by the insured – Allowed by the National Commission holding that the insurance policy covered the complainant’s warehouse and the roofi ng work did not signifi cantly increase the risk and directed payment of specifi ed amount with interest – Correctness: Held: Insurance company’s obligation to the insured is of much greater import – Precise cause of a fi re, whether attributed to a short-circuit or any alternative factor, remains immaterial, provided the claimant is not the instigator of the fi re – Claim of the insured against the insurer is upheld – Insurer cannot introduce additional reasoning beyond those detailed in their letter, to justify the repudiation – Area where the fi re occurred was covered by the said insurance policy – Looking at the various documents, it is reasonable to conclude that the insured premises was the one that was identifi ed and insured by the insurance company – Repair work undertaken on the rooftop to prevent water leakage to the warehouse would not fall in the category of an alteration which would increase the risk insured for the 1027 102 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. warehouse premises – Signifi cant time gap that exists between the welding work and the fi re has no logical explanation – Basis of the repudiation accordingly appears to be unreasonable and is not acceptable – Surveyor’s report, although comprehensive otherwise, is inconclusive on the aspect identifying the actual cause of fi re – Given that the surveyor’s report only relies on the Forensic Examiner fi ndings, it would be unsafe to rely on the said report – Furthermore, the claimant neither assumes the role of importer nor owner; instead, they function solely as a custodian entrusted with the goods on behalf of their clients – Customs duty component of the claim should, in the given event, be discharged directly to the Customs Department – Thus, it is a case of wrongful repudiation by the insurer – No legal infi rmity in the impugned decision allowing the insured’s insurance claim. [Paras 33, 35, 37, 41, 47, 50, 55, 56, 58] Insurance – Insurance contracts – Doctrine of uberrimae fi dei: Held: Trust serves as the cornerstone, forming the essence of the insurer-insured relationship – Fundamental principle is that insurance is governed by the doctrine of uberrimae fi dei-there must be complete good faith on the part of the insured – Heart and soul of an insurance contract lies in the protection it accords to those who wish to be insured by it – This understanding encapsulates the foundational belief that insurance accords protection and indemnifi cation, preserving the sanctity of trust within its clauses – Eff ectively, the insurer assumes a fi duciary duty to act in good faith and honour their commitment – This responsibility becomes particularly pronounced when the insured, in their actions, have not been negligent – In light of the vital role that trust plays in insurance contracts, it is important to ensure that the insurer adequately fulfi ls the duty that has been cast on it, by virtue of such a covenant.
