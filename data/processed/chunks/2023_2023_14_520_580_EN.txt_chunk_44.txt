Entry 23-C provides that a suit for perpetual injunction can be fi led before the Court of Assistant Collector within a period of three years from the date the cause of action arises. Entry 5 provides that a suit for declaration of the plaintiff ’s right as a tenant, or as a tenant of Khudkasht, or as a sub-tenant, or for a share in a joint tenancy are also to be fi led in the Court of Assistant Collector. Similarly, suit for declaration of tenancy rights or for recovery of possession or for ejectment of trespassers can be fi led under Sections 89, 187 and 183 respectively, vide entries 6, 23 and 23-A respectively in the Third Schedule. 73. Once it is established that two bighas out of three bighas of the land in dispute was agricultural land and as such fell within the purview of the 1955 Act, in my view, though the revenue court may not have had the jurisdiction to annul the notifi cation acquiring the land, which, in any case, was not sought for by the plaintiff , the suit for injunction was maintainable before the Revenue Court by virtue of Entries 8A and 23-C read with Entries 5, 6, 23 and 23A of the Third Schedule of the 1955 Act. Thus, the Suit before the Civil Court was barred by Section 207 read with Section 256 of the 1955 Act. Issue no. (iii) is decided accordingly. 29 (2019) 3 SCC 692 30 (1985) 1 SCC 475 580 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. Conclusion 74. As I have found the suit not maintainable insofar as it related to the land covered by the acquisition notifi cation and also barred by Section 207 read with Section 256 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955, the defendant’s appeal is entitled to be allowed and is hereby allowed. The and decree of the High Court as well as of the First Appellate Court are set aside and the decree passed by the Trial Court is restored. In view of the diff erence of opinions and the distinguishing s (Justice Hrishikesh Roy dismissing the appeal and Justice Manoj Misra allowing the appeal), the Registry is directed to place the matter before Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for referring the matter to a larger Bench.
