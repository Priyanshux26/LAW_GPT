The Commission noticed that the Judges in the Family Courts in Maharashtra are recruited through a separate process and the officers form part of a separate cadre. At the same time, Rule 8 of the Judges of F the Family Courts (Recruitment and Service Conditions) Maharashtra Rules, 1990 also provides that the judge shall draw pay and allowances at par with the judges (Principal Judge, Additional Principal Judge and Judge respectively) of the City Civil Court, Bombay and at other places pay and allowances as admissible to the District Judge. G 79. The recommendation of the Commission is that the Judges of the Family Court also be entitled to the benefit of Selection Grade and 33 Section 7 and 7A of the Industrial Tribunals Act, 1947 respectively. 34 State of Kerala v.

Minimum Remuneration to Special Judicial Magistrates (Second Class) and Special Metropolitan C Magistrates (Recommendation 44.19) 81. A reading of para 36 of the report of the Commission shows that in some states, officials who have worked in the judiciary, retired executive officials possessing law degree etc. are appointed as Special Judicial Magistrates under Sections 11 and 13 of the CrPC, 1973. The D Commission noted that in some states they are paid very meagre remuneration and consequently has recommended a minimum pay of Rs. 30,000 per month and a conveyance allowance of Rs. 5,000/-. The Commission has further recommended that this benefit shall be given from 01.04.2019. E 82. The amicus has argued that even Rs. 30,000 is insufficient today and such a low amount might not meet the minimum wage requirements in certain states. Considering that under Section 261, CrPC, 1973 such Magistrates can try offences which are punishable with fine or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months, such Magistrates cannot be considered as discharging judicial functions that are incomparable to F regular Magistrates. As such, their financial independence is as much a part of judicial independence as is for regular Magistrates. Thus, the recommendation of the Commission modified by fixing the remuneration at Rs. 45,000/- per month plus an additional sum of Rs. 5,000/- as conveyance allowance. G 83. For the purpose of convenience, the recommendations and their modifications/acceptance is tabulated below: 36 State of Kerala v. B. Renjith Kumar, (2008) 12 SCC 219 at para 19.
