Civil Appeal No. 3148 of 2012 (M/s. Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. Vs. Governor, State of Orissa) came to be disposed of alongwith Civil Appeal No. 2841 of 2015 (M/s. S.A. Builders Vs. North Delhi Municipal Corporation) and other connected appeals vide the dated 12.03.2015. This Court referred to its earlier decision in M/s. Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. (supra) and held that the decision in S.L. Arora (supra) does not lay down the correct law.

Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. (supra). In M/s. Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd.

Therefore, the post-award interest that may be awarded would be on the principal amount as well as on the interest on the principal amount which together would constitute the sum awarded. 21. Civil Appeal No. 2841 of 2015 i.e. the civil appeal of the respondent was allowed by directing that the interest component payable to the respondent shall be computed in accordance with the law laid down in M/s. Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. (supra) and not in accordance with S.L. Arora (supra) since S.L. Arora (supra) has been overruled in M/s. Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. (supra). Resultantly, the decisions of the Single Bench as affirmed by the Division Bench were set aside; respondent was given liberty to seek execution of the award in terms of M/s. Hyder Consulting (UK) Ltd. (supra). 22.

No. 99/1998 praying for a direction for refund of the excess payment which was quantified at Rs. 1,54,19,281.00 alongwith interest @ 18% from 09.09.2010 till the date of payment. Thereafter, appellant filed another application being EA(OS) No. 25/2015 for amending the earlier application being EA(OS) No. 364/2013. It was stated that the refund claim amount was Rs. 5,45,41,756.00 as on 09.09.2010.
