PW 1 Mahesh Kumar Garg father of Sachin Garg has stated that the kidnappers after kidnapping his son gave threatening on the telephone repeatedly that in case ransom amount is not paid or police is informed, his son would be killed and due to this reason, he did not report the matter to the police. When a person under threat of life has paid ransom for release of his kidnapped son and if he does not report the matter to the police under constant fear of his and his family life, if the FIR was lodged by the police official, does not amount that it has created suspicion in the present case but in such a case, role of agency must be appreciated.
