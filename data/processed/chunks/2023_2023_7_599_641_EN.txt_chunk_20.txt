50. In the notice invoking arbitration dated 29-4-2020, it has been averred that: “Various communications have been exchanged between G the petitioner and the respondents ever since and a dispute has arisen between the petitioner and the respondents, regarding non-payment of the amounts due under the tender document.” H 628 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A 51. The period of limitation for issuing notice of arbitration would not get extended by mere exchange of letters, [S.S. Rathore v. State of M.P., (1989) 4 SCC 582 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 50; Union of India v. Har Dayal, (2010) 1 SCC 394; CLP (India) (P) Ltd. v. Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 185] or mere settlement discussions, where a final bill is B rejected by making deductions or otherwise. Sections 5 to 20 of the Limitation Act do not exclude the time taken on account of settlement discussions. Section 9 of the Limitation Act makes it clear that:”where once the time has begun to run, no subsequent disability or inability to institute a suit or make C an application stops it.” There must be a clear notice invoking arbitration setting out the “particular dispute” [ Section 21 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.] (including claims/amounts) which must be received by the other party within a period of 3 years from the rejection of a final bill, failing which, the time bar would prevail. D 52. In the present case, the notice invoking arbitration was issued 5½ years after rejection of the claims on 4-8-2014. Consequently, the notice invoking arbitration is ex facie time- barred, and the disputes between the parties cannot be referred to arbitration in the facts of this case.” E Amendment required However, this Court in the above said case observed that since there is vacuum in the law to provide a period of limitation under Section 11 of the Act 1996 the Courts have taken recourse to the position that the limitation period would be governed by Article 137 of the Limitation F Act, 1963 which provides a period of three years from the date when the right to apply accrues. This Court considered this as an unduly long period for filing an application under Section 11, since it would defeat the very object of the Act 1996, which provides for expeditious resolution of commercial disputes within a time bound period. The Act has been G amended in 2015 and 2019 respectively to provide for further time limits to ensure that the arbitration proceedings are conducted and concluded expeditiously. Section 29A mandates that the arbitral tribunal will conclude the proceedings within a period of 18 months. In view of the legislative intent, the period of 3 years for filing an application under Section 11 would run contrary to the scheme of the Act. H M/S B AND T AG v. MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 629 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] This Court, therefore, considered it necessary for the Parliament A to effect an amendment to Section 11 of the Act 1996, prescribing a specific period of limitation within which a party may move the court for making an application for appointment of arbitrators under Section 11 of the Act [Reference: Article titled as ‘Limitation for Filing Application for Appointment of Arbitrator’ by Mr. M.
