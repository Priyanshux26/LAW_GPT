Conclusion ...........................................................................61 1. Applications for condonation of delay in refi ling the writ petitions are allowed. I. Background 2. In a batch of three hundred and eighty four petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioners challenge the constitutional validity of Sections 95 to 100 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 20161. The individual facts of each case are not reproduced here as we are deciding the constitutionality of the above provisions of the IBC. 3. The principle aims of the IBC are to promote investment, and resolution of insolvencies of corporate persons, fi rms, and individuals in a time bound manner. The IBC consolidated and amended a web of laws which had led to an ineff ective and ineffi cient mechanism for resolution of insolvencies marked with signifi cant delays. 4. Part III of the IBC deals with insolvency resolution and bankruptcy for individuals and partnership fi rms. Chapter III of Part III which is titled “Insolvency Resolution Process” (“IRP”) comprises of Sections 94 to 120. Prior to the introduction of the IBC, insolvency in relation to individuals was governed by the provisions of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act 1909 and the Provincial Insolvency Act 1920, both of which stand repealed. 5. The provisions of the IBC apply to personal guarantors to corporate debtors.2 In exercise of the power conferred by Section 1(3), a notifi cation was issued on 15 November 2019 by the Union Government in the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs. The notifi cation brought into force Section 2(e), Section 78 (except with regard to fresh start process), Section 79, Section 94 to 187, Sections 239(2)(g), (h) and (i), Sections 239(2)(m) to (zc); Section 239(2) (zn) to (zs) and Section 249. The notifi cation was challenged before this Court. In Lalit Kumar Jain v Union of India3 a two-Judge Bench inter 1 “IBC” 2 Section 2(e), IBC as amended by the Amending Act 8 of 2018 3 (2021) 9 SCC 321 DILIP B JIWRAJKA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS 575 alia, held that the liability of a guarantor is not discharged merely on the discharge of the corporate debtor. 6. By Amending Act 26 of 2018, Parliament introduced amendments inter alia, in Section 60 which provides for the jurisdiction of the adjudicating authority, namely, the National Company Law Tribunal.4 Among other things, the amendments to Section 60 comprehend the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in matters involving the bankruptcy of a corporate guarantor or personal guarantor, as the case may be, of a corporate debtor. 7. In to consider the nature of challenge in these proceedings, it would be appropriate to make a brief reference to the provisions of the IBC. II. Scheme of the IBC 8. Part I of the IBC deals with preliminary matters, such as its application and defi nitions.
