In this regard, reliance is placed on Neelu Chopra and Another vs. Bharti3 and Myakala Dharmarajam & Ors. Vs. State of Telangana & Anr.4 (vi) Since, the generation of proceeds of crime is not an offence under Section 3 of PMLA and the said offence could be 2 (1995) Supp (3) SCC 376 3 [2009] 14 SCR 1074 : (2009) 10 SCC 184 4 (2020) 2 SCC 743 792 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports committed only after the accomplishment of the Scheduled Offence, the alleged act could not be said to be an offence under Section 3 of PMLA. The act of the appellants assisting Satyendar Jain for accumulating assets as alleged by the CBI, cannot be said to be an offence under the PMLA. (vii) The control of the entire records of the companies was with the appellants, including the bank accounts. They were the main decision- makers being the Directors, in respect of the acts performed on behalf of the Companies, and Mr. Satyendar Jain had nothing to do with the said Companies after 2013. The prosecution has unnecessarily tried to link the appellants with Satyendar Jain from the statements of witnesses recorded under Section 50 of the PMLA. (viii) The Scheduled Offence does not allege conspiracy. The day Mr. Satyendar Jain decided to enter into politics, all the relations with him whether in respect of the Companies or any business transactions were severed, and since July 2013 he was neither a Director nor a shareholder nor had any relation with the Companies which were the Companies of the appellants. (ix) The appellants are in custody since 30.06.2022 except for the period when they were released on the interim bail (Vaibhav Jain on 18.08.2023 to 27.12.2023 and Ankush Jain on 12.09.2023 to 27.12.2023). (x) The appellants have not violated any conditions imposed by the Court when on interim bail, and have also not tried to delay the proceedings before the trial court in any manner. 10.
