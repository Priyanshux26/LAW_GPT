8. The learned counsel submitted that the Respondents herein did not have the financial capacity to lend an amount of Rs.3,00,000/- each as on 20th October 1998 and 25th October 1998, when the promissory G notes were said to have been executed. It is further submitted that although it was the Respondents’ case that they had given the amounts out of their agricultural income, since they had not declared the same in their Income Tax Returns from 1992-1999, thus, there was no material to show that they could have lent money. To buttress her submissions, H RAJARAM S/O SRIRAMULU NAIDU THROUGH L.RS.v. 817 MARUTHACHALAM THROUGH L.RS. [B. R. GAVAI, J.] the learned counsel relies on the of this Court in the case of, A Basalingappa v. Mudibasappa1, 9. Per contra, Mr. V. Prabhakar, learned counsel for the Respondents, submits that the Appellant-Raja Ram had failed to produce any material evidence to substantiate the claim that his wife subscribed to the chit-funds run by Respondent, Maruthachalam. He submitted that B the High Court rightly observed that no material was produced by the Appellant-Raja Ram to prove that the cheques and promissory notes were issued only as a security for such a chit. He further submitted that no legal proceedings were initiated for the recovery of the alleged amount due by the Appellant either. C 10. The learned counsel submitted that there arose no occasion for the Appellant-Raja Ram to issue a blank cheque in the year 1992 for a chit to be subscribed much later in the year 1995. It is further submitted that even if certain amounts are not accounted for in the Income Tax Returns, this is a matter concerning only the defaulter and Revenue D Authority. Thus, a borrower cannot be allowed to take advantage of the same solely on the ground that such an amount does not reflect in the Income Tax Returns. The learned counsel relied on the s of this Court in the cases of Bir Singh v. Mukesh Kumar2, Rohitbhai Jivanlal Patel v. State of Gujarat and Anr3, Kalamani Tex and Anr v. P. Balasubramanian4 to buttress his submissions. E 11. We shall first consider the Criminal Appeals. 12. This Court in the case of Baslingappa v. Mudibasappa (supra) has summarized the principles on Sections 118(a) and 139 of the N.I. Act. It will be relevant to reproduce the same. F “25.
