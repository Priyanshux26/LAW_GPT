[Para 187] Res judicata – Constructive Res Judicata – Abuse of Process of Court – Collateral challenge to s that have attained finality – Proposition of law laid down by English Court of Chancery in Henderson v. Henderson, [1843] 3 Hare 999 – ‘Henderson’ Principle as a corollary of Constructive Res Judicata – Discussed: Held: 1. The ‘Henderson Principle’ is a foundational doctrine in common law that addresses the issue of multiplicity in litigation – It embodies the broader concept of procedural fairness, abuse of process and judicial efficiency by mandating that all claims and issues that could and ought to have been raised in a previous 1622 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports litigation should not be re-litigated in subsequent proceedings – The extended form of res-judicata more popularly known as ‘Constructive Res Judicata’ contained in Section 11, Explanation VII of the CPC originates from this principle. [Para 135] 2.1. ‘Henderson Principle’ is a core component of the broader doctrine of abuse of process, aimed at enthusing in the parties a sense of sanctity towards judicial adjudications and determinations – It ensures that litigants are not subjected to repetitive and vexatious legal challenges – At its core, the principle stipulates that all claims and issues that could and should have been raised in an earlier proceeding are barred from being raised in subsequent litigation, except in exceptional circumstances – This rule not only supports the finality of s but also underscores the ideals of judicial propriety and fairness. [Para 144] 2.2. There are, four situations where in second proceedings between the same parties doctrine res judicata as a corollary of the principle of abuse of process may be invoked: (i) cause of action estoppel, where the entirety of a decided cause of action is sought to be re-litigated; (ii) issue estoppel or, “decided issue estoppel,” where an issue is sought to be re-litigated which has been raised and decided as a fundamental step in arriving at the earlier judicial decision; (iii) extended or constructive res judicata i.e., “unraised issue estoppel,” where an issue is sought to be litigated which could, and should, have been raised in a previous action but was not raised; (iv) a further extension of the aforesaid to points not raised in relation to an issue in the earlier decision, as opposed to issues not raised in relation to the decision itself.
