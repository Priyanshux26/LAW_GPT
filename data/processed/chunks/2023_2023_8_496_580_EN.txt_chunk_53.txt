The rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution are to be read along with clauses (2) and (6) of Article 19, which carve out areas in respect of which valid legislation can be made.” D 19. In Union of India v. Naveen Jindal and Another19 (three- Judge Bench) this Court, while discussing the issue of a citizen’s right to fly the National Flag, on the issue of Right to freedom of Speech and Expression, noted the distinction between the Constitution of India and that of the United States of America. Such a distinction being that in the USA, the First Amendment gives an absolute right to a citizen of free E expression, but under Article 19(1)(a), no absolute right is conferred. It only provides for a qualified right, which is subject to regulatory measures contained in clause 2 of Article 19.20 This distinction between the Bill of Rights contained in the American Constitution and the fundamental rights provided for in the Indian Constitution was also noted in Superintendent, F Central Prison v. Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia21(five-Judge Bench); Pathumma v. State of Kerala22 (seven-Judge Bench);M.C. Mehta v. Union of India23 (Shriram – Oleum Gas) (five-Judge Bench); Ashok Kumar Thakur v. Union of India24 (two-Judge Bench)and Jayendra Vishnu Thakur v. State of Maharashtra25 (two-Judge Bench).

STATE OF ASSAM & ANR. 569 [SANJAY KAROL, J.] 20. In Ramlila Maidan Incident, In re, (2012) 5 SCC 1 (two- A Judge Bench), as submitted by the Union of India, while discussing the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression under Article 19, refused to apply the US case of Schneck v. United States26, which propounded the doctrine of clear and present danger, stating that it cannot be imported and applied in India.27 Further, holding that, the right to freedom of speech B and expression in India is subject to reasonable restrictions and therefore, there is a marked distinction in the language of law, its application and interpretation under the Indian and the US laws.28 21. Shreya Singhal (supra), this Court speaking through R.F. Nariman, J. highlighted on the differences between the US First C Amendment and Freedom of Speech and Expression under Article 19(1)(a) read with Article 19(2) in the following words: “15. It is significant to notice first the differences between the US First Amendment and Article 19(1)(a) read with Article 19(2). The first important difference is the absoluteness of the US First D Amendment—Congress shall make no law which abridges the freedom of speech. Second, whereas the US First Amendment speaks of freedom of speech and of the press, without any reference to “expression”, Article 19(1)(a) speaks of freedom of speech and expression without any reference to “the press”. Third, under the US Constitution, speech may be abridged, whereas under E our Constitution, reasonable restrictions may be imposed.
