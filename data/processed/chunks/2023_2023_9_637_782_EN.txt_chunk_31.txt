C 66. The 1910 Act did not include the State Electricity Board within the definition of “licensee”. Section 26 of the 1948 Act states that the Board shall, in respect of the whole State, have all the powers and obligations of a licensee under the 1910 Act. The first proviso specified that certain provisions of the 1910 Act relating to the duties and obligations D of a licensee shall not be applicable to the Board. In its decision in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Hindustan Aluminium Corporation32 this Court analysed the interconnection between Section 26 of the 1948 Act and Section 22 of the 1910 Act. The court held that the obligation under Section 22 of the 1910 Act to supply energy to every person within the area of supply is not fastened to the Board. Although Clause VI of E Schedule to the 1910 Act also mandates the licensee to supply electricity on demand, the second proviso specifies that the said clause is applicable to the Board only when the distribution mains have been laid by the Board and the supply through any of them has commenced. 67. Under Section 21 of the 1910 Act, the Supply Licensee F prescribed conditions with the previous sanction of the state government. Similarly, the Boards could also prescribe conditions under Section 21 of the 1910 Act by virtue of Section 26 of the 1948 Act. 68. Section 49 of the 1948 Act read as follows: “49. Provisions for the sale of electricity by the Board to G persons other than licensees.- (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of regulations, if any made in this behalf, the Board may supply electricity to any person not being a licensee 32 (1979) 3 SCC 229 H 682 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A upon such terms and conditions as the Board thinks fit and may for the purposes of such supply frame uniform tariffs.” *** (emphasis supplied) B Under the 1948 Act, the Electricity Boards were empowered to prescribe terms and conditions of supply under Section 49 read with Section 79(j). The Board was empowered to fix such terms and conditions as it thinks fit for supply of electricity to any person not being a licensee. Section 79 permitted the Board to make regulations providing for the principles governing the supply of electricity by the Board to persons C other than licensees under Section 49: “79. Power to make regulations.- The Board may by notification in the Official Gazette, make regulations not inconsistent with this Act and the rules made thereunder to provide for all or any of the following matters, namely:- D *** (j) principles governing the supply of electricity by the Board to persons other than licensees under section 49;” Clause (j) of Section 79 empowered the Board to make regulations E prescribing the principles governing the supply of electricity to consumers. According to Section 79A, any regulation made by the Board had to be laid before the State Legislature.
