According to us, the observations/findings referred above as (i) is actually an outcome of a misconstruction on the part of the learned Sessions Judge. In troth, the learned CJM termed the subject complaint dated 20.07.2011 as second complaint not with reference to the written objection/protest petition dated 05.05.2011 and it was so treated with reference to the original complaint dated 11.11.2010. This fact is evident from the recitals in Annexure-P9 dated 12.07.2012 passed by the learned CJM in complaint numbered as Case No.159/2011, which was challenged before the learned Sessions Judge. In the said the learned CJM observed and held thus:- [2024] 12 S.C.R. 9 Subrata Choudhury @ Santosh Choudhury & Ors. v. The State of Assam & Anr. “After the original complaint has been duly investigated by the police and Final Report submitted therein has been accepted by the Court in a Judicial Proceeding; therefore, in my considered view it cannot be re-opened by means of filing of a second complaint in respect of the same facts and circumstances.” In view of the afore-extracted recital from the dated 12.07.2012 of the learned CJM, it is evident that it was with reference to the original complaint that he termed the complaint filed by the second respondent on 20.07.2011 as the second complaint. 14. The second observation/finding referred above as (ii) also requires a clarification. It is true that correctly this Court held in the decision in Abhinandan Jha v. Dinesh Misra3 that even after accepting the final report it would be open to the Magistrate concerned to treat respective protest petition as complaint and to take further proceedings in accordance with law. Section 2(d) of the Cr.P.C. defines the term ‘complaint’. No doubt in Cr.P.C., no form for filing complaint is prescribed. However, the essentials to constitute a complaint can be briefly mentioned thus: - (i) An oral or written allegation; (ii) That some person(s) known or unknown has committed an offence; (iii) It must be made to a Magistrate with a view to his taking action. 15. In Bhimappa Bassappa Bhu Sannavar v. Laxman Shivarayappa Samagouda & Ors.,4 this Court, as regards the meaning of a complaint, held thus: - “11. The word “complaint” has a wide meaning since it includes even an oral allegation. It may, therefore, be assumed that no form is prescribed which the complaint must take. It may only be said that there must be an allegation which prima facie discloses the commission of an offence with the necessary facts for the magistrate to take action. Section 190(1)(a) makes it necessary that the alleged facts must disclose the commission of an offence.” 3 [1967] 3 SCR 668 : AIR 1968 SC 117 4 [1971] 1 SCR 1: (1970) 1 SCC 665 10 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 16. In the decision in Sunil Majhi v. The State,5 the Calcutta High Court in paragraph 6 held thus: - “6.The term ‘naraji’ means ‘disapproval’ and in the context of things it signifies disapproval of the report in relation to which it is filed.
