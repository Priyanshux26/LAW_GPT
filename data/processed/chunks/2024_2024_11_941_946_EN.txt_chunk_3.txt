Magriyan Ki Dhani Satyaya, District Jaisalmer, Rajasthan. 20. In such circumstances, without disturbing the of bail passed by the High Court, we direct that the Respondent No.2 – herein shall not enter the said village till the completion of the trial. As we have asked the respondent No.2 – accused not to enter the village, he shall furnish address of his new residence to the investigating officer attached with the concerned police station. The Respondent No.2 shall not try to influence any of the prosecution witnesses in any manner or directly or indirectly try to contact the victim and her family. 21. Having regard to the nature of the alleged crime, it will be in the fitness of things if the Trial Court gives some priority to the Sessions Case No.53/2023 and try to dispose it of within a period of three months from today. 946 [2024] 11 S.C.R.
