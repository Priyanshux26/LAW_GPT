Tanmaya Agarwal, Wrick Chatterjee, Mrs. Aditi Agarwal, Vinayak Mohan, Advs. for the Respondents. / of the Supreme Court Aravind Kumar, J. 1. This appeal is directed against the dated 19.01.2010 passed in Writ Petition No.1995 of 2010 by the High Court of judicature at Allahabad whereunder the writ petition filed by the appellants herein (hereinafter referred to as ‘writ petitioners or petitioners’) challenging the dated 23.09.2009 passed in Revision No.68 of 2008-09 came to be dismissed and said came to be upheld for the reason that the revision petition is not maintainable and consequently the dated 07.02.2008 passed by the Additional Collector holding that proceedings for cancellation of the patta could be started at any time came to be upheld. 2. By our dated 13.03.2024, we had made it clear that since none had appeared on behalf of the appellants (writ petitioners) no further adjournment would be granted and in the interest of justice one last opportunity came to be extended to the writ petitioners. However, even today when the matter is called in the second round none has appeared on behalf of the appellants. Hence, we have proceeded to examine the case on merits by considering the pleas advanced in the appeal, grounds urged therein and the arguments advanced on behalf of the respondents’ counsel. 3. Short facts leading to the filing of this appeal are as under: 4. In the year 1969-70, the khasra plot No.185 in Rampur Kedhar Village, UP was designated as a Panchayat Ghar but later it was declared unsuitable in 1993. On the request of the village Pradhan a portion of the said plot was re-assigned for residential use by the Assistant Collector and subsequently different plots of land in said survey number came to be allotted to different individuals including the writ petitioners under Section 122-C(i)(d) of Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act (hereafter referred to as ‘UPZALR Act’ for short). 290 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
