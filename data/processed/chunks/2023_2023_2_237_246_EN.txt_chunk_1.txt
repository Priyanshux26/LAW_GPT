This document was a registered one; further, the late ‘U’, predecessor of the appellant, also signed a document which acknowledged the existence of the will. If all the above circumstances are considered in totality, and one also keeps in D mind the fact that none of the heirs of ‘U’ contested the grant of letters of administration, there can be only one conclusion, i.e., that the will was duly executed, and the propounder/respondent herein was successful in proving it.

The of the Court was delivered by B S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J. Background 1. This appeal, by special leave, challenges a and of the Calcutta High Court,1 which affirmed a and decree by the trial court2 allowing a petition for grant of letters of administration C under Section 278 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 (hereinafter, “Act”). The aggrieved defendant is the appellant before this court. 2. The facts in brief are that one Gosaidas Samanta (hereinafter, “testator”) had three sons – Upendra, Anukul and Mahadev. He died, survived by his three sons and widow Bhagbati Das, and left behind a D will dated 16.11.1929. The testator bequeathed his estate among three heirs – his sons Anukul and Mahadev, and his grandson Shibu, the son of Upendra (who was not granted any share). On 21.02.1945, a partition deed was drawn between these three co-sharers. This arrangement was apparently accepted by Upendra, who executed a disclaimer E document, in respect of one part of the properties, sold by Shibu, out of his share. 3. In 1952, alleging that he was in occupation of a part of the properties owned by the testator, and that he had purchased them from Upendra, the present appellant filed a suit for partition and possession. F The suit was dismissed on the finding that the present appellant had no title.3 That was however reversed by the appellate court which passed a preliminary decree for partition.4 Upon a further appeal by the present respondent (the son of Mahadev), the High Court noticed that although the will had been relied upon, it was neither probated nor were letters of administration sought in respect of it.5 The High Court cast G doubts about the possession of the respondent herein.
