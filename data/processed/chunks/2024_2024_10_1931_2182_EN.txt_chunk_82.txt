It does not extend to the production of articles. Raw materials are essential ingredients for manufacture or production but they are not of the same nature or description as the articles produced by the process of manufacture. The articles or class of articles relatable to the scheduled industry could only comprise of finished products of a cognate character. Raw materials, not being finished products, are not articles which are relatable to the scheduled industry covered by Section 18G;206 204 Tika Ramji (supra) [24] 205 ibid 206 Tika Ramji (supra) 32 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 2039 State of U.P. & Ors. v. M/s Lalta Prasad Vaish and sons d. Sugarcane is a raw material for the production of sugar. Consequently, it is not an article relatable to the sugar industry and does not fall within the scope of Section 18G. The IDRA did not affect the legislative powers of the State Legislature with respect to sugarcane. Therefore, the UP Sugarcane Act was not repugnant to the IDRA;207 and e. Even if it were assumed that sugarcane was relatable to the sugar industry under Section 18G, the Central Government had not issued a notified , as required by the provision. The mere possibility that a notified may be issued could not lead to repugnancy. Such an was an essential prerequisite for repugnancy to arise.208 134. The decision in Tika Ramji (supra) was relied upon by this Court in Calcutta Gas (supra), Kannan Devan Hills Produce v. State of Kerala,209 Ganga Sugar Corporation v. State of UP,210 B Viswanathiah & Co. v. State of Karnataka211 and the majority in ITC (supra) on the aspect of the meaning of industry covered by Entry 24 of List II. The dissenting opinion of Justice Pattanaik for himself and Justice Bharucha in ITC (supra) doubted the correctness of Tika Ramji (supra) on that aspect. 135. The Union of India submitted that the inclusion of ‘raw materials’ in Entry 27 of List II (and their consequential exclusion from the definition of ‘industry’ in Entry 24 of List II and Entry 52 of List I) in Tika Ramji (supra) must be overruled. It was submitted that ‘industry’ as it features in the legislative lists includes raw materials as well. The learned Solicitor General submitted that if the restrictive meaning in Tika Ramji (supra) is overruled, then the State will not have competence to legislate on ENA used for the preparation of potable alcohol under Entry 8. 136. We have in the preceding section held that the industry of intoxicating liquor is covered by Entry 8 and not Entry 52. Thus, even if a broad 207 id 208 id 209 [1973] 1 SCR 356 : (1972) 2 SCC 218 210 [1980] 1 SCR 769 : (1980) 1 SCC 223 211 [1991] 1 SCR 305 : (1991) 3 SCC 258 2040 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports meaning is given to the word ‘industry’ in Entry 52, it will not impact the decision in this case because Entry 8 is the specific entry which applies to the industry of intoxicating liquor.
