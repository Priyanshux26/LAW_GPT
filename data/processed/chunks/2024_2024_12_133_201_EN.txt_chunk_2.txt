Held: The respondent couldn’t be said to have had been prosecuting the IBC proceedings in good faith and in a bonafide manner – An element of mistake is inherent in the relief envisaged under Section 14 of the Limitation Act – In the present case, the respondent had initially approached the High Court with an application u/s.11(6) – However, for reasons best known to it, the respondent abandoned the said proceedings for appointment of arbitrator and approached the NCLT, Kolkata with an application u/s.9 of the IBC – The respondent was fully aware of the objection of a pre-existing dispute raised by the appellant in response to its second statutory demand notice issued u/s.8 of the IBC – Despite having preferred an application u/s.11(6) of the Act, 1996 before the jurisdictional court, and also being fully aware of the infirmities in the s.9 application filed under the IBC, the respondent took a conscious decision to abandon the right course of proceedings – The conduct of the respondent cannot be termed to be a mistake in any manner – Having taken a conscious decision to opt for specific remedy under the IBC which is not for the same relief as an application u/s.11(6) of the Act, 1996, the respondent cannot be now allowed to take the plea of ignorance or mistake and must bear the consequences of its decisions. [Para 110] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.11(6) – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – Limitation Act, 1963 – s.5 – Whether the delay caused by the respondent in filing the fresh arbitration application u/s.11(6) of the Act, 1996 can be condoned u/s.5 of the Limitation Act: Held: The position of law is that the benefit u/s.5 of the Limitation Act is available in respect of the applications filed for appointment of arbitrator u/s.11(6) of the Act, 1996 – Further, the requirement of filing an application u/s.5 of the Limitation Act is not a mandatory pre-requisite for a court to exercise its discretion under the said provision and condone the delay in institution of an application or appeal – The respondent took a conscious decision to abandon its first s.11(6) application with a view to pursue proceedings u/s.9 of the IBC – The respondent [2024] 12 S.C.R. 137 M/s HPCL Bio-Fuels Ltd. v. M/s Shahaji Bhanudas Bhad made such choice despite a specific objection raised by the appellant in its reply to the statutory demand notice that there were pre-existing disputes between the parties – In view of this, maximisation of the chances of getting the application u/s.9 of the IBC admitted by the NCLT seems to have been the only reason for the abandonment of the first s.11(6) application by the respondent – In light of such conduct on the part of the respondent, this Court is of the view that the present case does not warrant the exercise of discretion u/s.5 of the Limitation Act. [Paras 121, 122] Limitation – Object of having a limitation period: Held: The basic premise behind the statutes providing for a limitation period is encapsulated by the maxim “Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt ” which means that the law assists those who are vigilant and not those who sleep over their rights – The object behind having a prescribed limitation period is to ensure that there is certainty and finality to the litigation and assurance to the opposite party that it will not be subject to an indefinite period of liability – Another object achieved by a fixed limitation period is that only those claims which are initiated before the deterioration of evidence takes place are allowed to be litigated – The law of limitation does not act to extinguish the right but only bars the remedy.
