24. In 1951, the AMU Act was amended in to bring it in line with the Constitution [which came in to force in 1950]. This was simultaneous with similar amendments being carried out to the BHU Act. The AMU Act was further amended in 1965, 1972 and 1981. The content and the purport of the amendments to the AMU Act over the years shall be discussed in detail in a separate section of the . 25. On 28.12.1952, the Government of India set up an ‘interim’ University Grants Commission (hereinafter referred to as “UGC”) by resolution to advise it on the allocation of grants-in-aid from public funds. On 03.03.1956, the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 [hereinafter referred to as the “UGC Act”] was enacted thereby giving statutory recognition to the UGC. 26. In 1968, the in Azeez Basha [supra] was delivered which held that the AMU was neither established nor administered by the minority community. After the judgement in Azeez Basha [supra] was delivered, the AMU was treated to be a free and open institution as opposed to a minority educational institution. This position continued until 1981 when the Parliament passed The Aligarh Muslim University (Amendment) Act, 1981. This Act made several changes to the provisions of the 1920 Act chief among which was an amendment to Section 2(l) which now read as follows: (l) “University” means the educational institution of their choice established by the Muslims of India, which orginated as the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh and which was subsequently incorporated as the Aligarh Muslim University.” 27. An addition was also made of clause 5(2)(c) dealing with the powers of the University which gave the University power “to promote especially the educational and cultural advancement of the Muslims of India”. The word “established” was deleted from the long title of the Act and it now read “An Act to incorporate a teaching and residential Muslim University at Aligarh” as opposed to the unamended long title 1928 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports i.e., “An Act to establish and incorporate a teaching and residential Muslim University at Aligarh”. The Act also empowered the Court of the University to act as the Supreme Governing Body. 28. Consequent to this amendment, no issue arose till 2005, when the Admissions Committee of the University took a decision at its meeting of January 10, 2005 to reserve 50% of seats in the Post Graduate Medical Courses for Muslims. The same was also accepted by the Union of India on February 25, 2005. The Resolutions providing such reservations and the 1981 amendments were challenged before a Single Judge of the Hon’ble High Court of Judicature at Allahabad [hereinafter referred to as the “Allahabad High Court” or “High Court”] on the ground that the amendments amounted to an impermissible legislative overruling of Azeez Basha [supra]. 29. The Single Judge had read down Section 2(l) to mean that the word “established” in that section would refer to the MAO college and not the University. The learned Single Judge further held that the amendment of 1981 did not turn the AMU into a minority institution because Azeez Basha [supra] still held the field.
