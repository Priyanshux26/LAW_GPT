3 SCC 217 [Justice Reddy, 798] 247 AIR 1967 SC 295 [28] 248 Nagaraj v. Union of India (2006) 8 SCC 212 [117] 1438 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports However, in the subsequent paragraphs, this Court held that the cadre strength must be taken as a unit to ascertain whether a given class or group is adequately represented. These observations were made in the backdrop of RK Sabharwal (supra) where this Court held that the entire cadre strength should be taken into account to determine if the quota limit has been breached. The relevant observations are delineated as under: “82. Before dealing with the scope of the constitutional amendments we need to recap the s in Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] and R.K. Sabharwal [(1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548 : (1995) 29 ATC 481]. In the former case the majority held that 50% rule should be applied to each year otherwise it may happen that the open competition channel may get choked if the entire cadre strength is taken as a unit. However, in R.K. Sabharwal [(1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548 : (1995) 29 ATC 481] this Court stated that the entire cadre strength should be taken into account to determine whether the reservation up to the quota limit has been reached. It was clarified that the in Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] was confined to initial appointments and not to promotions. The operation of the roster for filling the cadre strength, by itself, ensures that the reservation remains within the ceiling limit of 50%. 83. In our view, the appropriate Government has to apply the cadre strength as a unit in the operation of the roster in to ascertain whether a given class/group is adequately represented in the service. The cadre strength as a unit also ensures that upper ceiling limit of 50% is not violated. Further, roster has to be post-specific and not vacancy based.” (emphasis supplied) 202. At this juncture, it is important that we clarify the observations in Nagaraj (supra) extracted above. In Nagaraj (supra), this Court referred to the in RK Sabharwal while observing that [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1439 The State of Punjab & Ors. v. Davinder Singh & Ors. the cadre must be taken as a unit to determine the inadequacy of representation. However, the context in which RK Sabharwal (supra) held cadre must be considered as a unit was different. In that case, two issues were considered. First, whether appointments of the backward classes in the general category must be counted while working out the percentage of reservation for the backward classes. Second, whether the reservation is complete when the posts earmarked for the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes are filled. It is while answering the second of the issues that this Court held that reservations must operate in accordance with the roster maintained in the Department which will be a running account every year to ensure that there is no excessive reservation.
