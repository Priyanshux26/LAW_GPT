Supreme Court Reports sought to amalgamate oppressed castes of India into a single all-India category of ‘Depressed Classes’.20 A.2.1. The concept of linguistic minorities 16. History indicates that during the British Rule, Hindi was sought to be projected as the language of the majority community.21 In this vein, the British decided to introduce the permissive use of the Devanagari script in the Courts of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, with a view to undermine the influence of the Mughal elites.22 From the late 19th century onwards, there seemed to be murmurs against the perceived imposition of Hindi language, in regions where other languages were spoken. These concerns were endeavoured to be redressed by reorganising and carving out new States, predominantly on linguistic considerations, such as, for instance, the division of the States of Bihar and Odisha.23 17. The reorganization of the States based on linguistic differences gained momentum with the appointment of the Indian Statutory Commission, and subsequently,in April 1938, when a resolution was passed by the Madras Legislative Assembly, unsuccessfully recommending the establishment of four new Provinces from the former Madras Presidency. Ultimately, the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 enabled the division of States on a linguistic basis, aligning administrative boundaries with the linguistic identities of the population. A.2.2. The concept of religious minorities 18. In addition to linguistic minorities, the question of rights and privileges for religious minorities also gained prominence. The genesis of this category of minority rights in India can be traced back to the 1909 Morley-Minto Constitutional Reforms, which introduced separate electorates and reserved quotas to protect the interests of one of 20 Sumit Mukherjee, “Conceptualisation and Classification of Caste and Tribe by the Census of India,” Journal of the Anthropological Survey of India, (2013), Vol. 62 no. 2 pp.807. 21 Tariq Rahman, “Punjabi Language during British Rule,” International Journal of Punjab Studies (2007). 22 Amit Ranjan, “How Hindi came to dominate India” The Diplomat, (06 May, 2017) available at https:// thediplomat.com/2017/05/how-hindi-came-to-dominate-india/. 23 Fazal Ali, Report of the States Reorganisation Committee (1955), available at https://www.mha.gov.in/ sites/default/files/State%20Reorganisation%20Commisison%20Report%20of%201955_270614.pdf.

Naresh Agarwal & Ors. the minority communities within the evolving political framework.24 Following this development, the British government extended similar provisions to other communities, as well as the Depressed Classes, thereby institutionalizing measures for their representation and protection.25 19. Subsequently, political organisations seeking to leverage the 1919 Montagu-Chelmsford reforms played a crucial role in consolidating minority identities.26 The principle that eventually emerged for Indian representation in colonial institutions was that minority groups should be represented in proportion to their population size.27 The primary demand of these groups was to secure safeguards against potential dominance by the Congress or the majority community in Indian politics. 20. The 1928 Simon Commission further solidified the foundation of minority rights by recommending the continuation of separate electorates.28 At the same time, the 1928 Nehru Report, which influenced the framing of a Constitution for India, laid great emphasis on the safeguards of minorities.29 However, in a significant departure from the 1916 Lucknow Pact,30 the Committee rejected the Muslim League’s demands for separate electorates, noting that communal protection was no longer necessary for Hindus and Muslims.31 21.
