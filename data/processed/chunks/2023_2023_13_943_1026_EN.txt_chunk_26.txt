Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14, and if it aff ects any matter relating to public employment, it is also violative of Article 16. Articles 14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in State action and ensure fairness and equality of treatment.” This view was approved by the Constitution Bench in Ajay Hasia case [(1981) 2 SCR 79 : (1981) 1 SCC 722 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 258 : AIR 1981 SC 487 : (1981) 1 LLJ 103]. It thus appears well-settled that Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in executive/administrative action because any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve the negation of equality. One need not confi ne the denial of equality to a comparative evaluation between two persons to arrive at a conclusion of discriminatory treatment. An action per se arbitrary itself denies equal of (sic) protection by law. The Constitution Bench pertinently observed in Ajay Hasia case [(1981) 2 SCR 79 : (1981) 1 SCC 722 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 258 : AIR 1981 SC 487 : (1981) 1 LLJ 103] and put the matter beyond controversy when it said “wherever therefore, there is arbitrariness in State action whether it be of the Legislature or of the executive or of an ‘authority’ under Article 12, Article 14 immediately springs into action and strikes down such State action”. This view was further elaborated and affi rmed in D.S. Nakara v. Union of India [(1983) 1 SCC 305 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 145 : (1983) UPSC 263 : AIR 1983 SC 130]. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [ (1978) 2 SCR 621 : (1978) 1 SCC 248 : AIR 1978 SC 597] it was observed that Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action LOMBARDI ENGINEERING LTD. v. UTTARAKHAND JAL 981 VIDYUT NIGAM LTD. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. It is thus too late in the day to contend that an executive action shown to be arbitrary is not either judicially reviewable or within the reach of Article 14. The contention as formulated by Mr Sinha must accordingly be negatived. ” (Emphasis supplied) 65. The Court thereafter, took notice of the fact that the 10 % “deposit- at-call” of the amount claimed therein was to avoid frivolous claims by the party invoking arbitration. This Court went on to say that a frivolous claim can always be dismissed with exemplary costs. 66. Keeping the aforesaid in mind, if we look into the 7% pre-deposit condition in the case on hand, as contained in Clause 55 of the GCC it is evident that nothing has been provided as to how this amount of 7% is to be ultimately adjusted at the end of the arbitral proceedings. With a view to salvage this situation, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent invited the attention of this Court to Clause 3 of the GCC, which relates to the security deposit for performance.
