[2024] 1 S.C.R. 114 : 2024 INSC 14 Case Details DBS Bank Limited Singapore v. Ruchi Soya Industries Limited and Another (Civil Appeal No. 9133 of 2019) 03 January 2024 [Sanjiv Khanna* and S.V.N. Bhatti, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether s.30(2)(b)(ii) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, as amended in 2019, entitles the dissenting financial creditor to be paid the minimum value of its security interest; whether the amendments made in the substantive portion of s.30(2), in terms of Explanation 2 will be applicable when the first appeal was heard by NCLAT. Headnotes Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.30(2)(b)(ii) – Interpretation: Held: s.30(2)(b)(ii) forfends the dissenting financial creditor from settling for a lower amount payable under the resolution plan – A financial creditor can dissent if the resolution plan is discriminatory or against a provision of law– However, a dissenting financial creditor cannot take advantage of s.30(2)(b)(ii) – A secured creditor cannot claim preference over another secured creditor at the stage of distribution on the ground of a dissent or assent, otherwise the distribution would be arbitrary and discriminative – Purpose of the amendment was only to ensure that a dissenting financial creditor does not get anything less than the liquidation value, but not for getting the maximum of the secured assets – There is a contradiction in the reasoning given in the of this Court in India Resurgence ARC Private Limited v. Amit Metaliks Limited & Another [2021] 6 SCR 611, which is in discord with the ratio decidendi of the decisions of the three Judge Bench in Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Limited v. Satish Kumar Gupta & Ors [2019] 16 SCR 275 and Jaypee Kensington Boulevard Apartments Welfare Association & Others. v. NBCC (India) Limited & Others [2021] 12 SCR 603 – Provisions of s.30(2)(b)(ii) by * Author [2024] 1 S.C.R. 115 DBS BANK LIMITED SINGAPORE v. RUCHI SOYA INDUSTRIES LIMITED AND ANOTHER law provides assurance to the dissenting creditors that they will receive as money the amount they would have received in the liquidation proceedings – This rule also applies to the operational creditors – This ensures that dissenting creditors receive the payment of the value of their security interest – Paragraph 17 in India Resurgence is correct in its observations when it refers to the provisions of s.30(4) and that the voting is essentially a matter which relates to commercial wisdom of the CoC – The observation that a dissenting secured creditor cannot suggest that a higher amount be paid to it is also correct – However, this does not affect the right of a dissenting secured creditor to get payment equal to the value of the security interest in terms of s.30(2)(b)(ii) – Further, Paragraph 21 is partially correct – It is incorrect to state that the dissenting financial creditor would not be entitled to receive the liquidation value, the amount payable to him in terms of s.53(1) – Reasoning given in the earlier portion of paragraph 22 in conflict with the ratio in Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Limited as it does not take into account the legal effect of s.30(2)(b)(ii) – Present view taken different from India Resurgence ARC Private Limited on interpretation of s.30(2)(b)(ii) – Matter referred to larger Bench.
