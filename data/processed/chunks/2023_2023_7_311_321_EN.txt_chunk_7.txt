A Trust [State (NCT of Delhi) v. Manav Dharam Trust, (2017) 6 SCC 751 : (2017) 3 SCC (Civ) 611] , the case may be referred to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India under the provisions of 6 Rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013. He has relied upon the decision of this Court in Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma [Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma, (2019) B 6 SCC 162 : (2019) 3 SCC (Civ) 171] in which, in view of the conflict of opinion of two Division Bench s [Prakash v. Phulavati, (2016) 2 SCC 36 : (2016) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] , [Danamma v. Amar, (2018) 3 SCC 343 : (2018) 2 SCC (Civ) 385] of this Court as to the interpretation of Section 6 of the C Hindu Succession Act, 1956 the matter was referred to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India, for constituting an appropriate Bench. However, in the instant case, the issue is different, whether we have to follow the decision in Manav Dharam Trust [State (NCT of Delhi) v. Manav Dharam Trust, (2017) 6 SCC 751 : (2017) 3 SCC (Civ) 611] or the earlier D decisions of this Court mentioned above. It is apparent that the decisions of the three-Judge Bench are binding on us, and in view of other consistent decisions of this Court, we have to follow them. It is not appropriate to refer the case to larger Bench under 6 Rule 2 of the Supreme Court E Rules. We find no fault in the s laying down the law that the purchase after Section 4 notification is void as against the State. We are not impressed with the submission raised on behalf of the purchasers to refer the matter for the constitution of a larger Bench to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice. When decisions of larger Bench and other Division Bench are F available, the case cannot be referred to a larger Bench.” (emphasis supplied) 8. The earlier of this Court in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Manav Dharma Trust2 was held to be not laying down good law. G 9. Subsequent thereto, Constitution Bench of this Court in Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal and Others3 had reiterated the same legal position that a subsequent buyer of the property after 2 (2017) 6 SCC 751 H 3 2020 SCC OnLine SC 316 GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI v. RAVINDER KUMAR 321 JAIN & ORS. [RAJESH BINDAL, J.] issuance of the notification under Section 4 the 1894 Act has no locus to A invoke Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act. Reference can be made to the relevant paragraph of the judgement. “340. …….. The beneficiaries i.e. landowners contemplated under the proviso to Section 24(2), are the ones who were so recorded as beneficiaries as on the date of issuance of B notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act. The provision is not meant to be invoked on the basis of void transactions, and by the persons who have purchased on the basis of power of attorney or otherwise, they cannot claim the benefit under Section 24 as is apparent from the proviso to Section 24(2) C and the decision in Shiv Kumar v. Union of India”.
