180. Earlier s of the US Courts had held that marriage is a civic right because it is fundamental to existence and survival168, is part of the fundamental right to privacy169, and essential to the ly pursuit of happiness.170 It was also held that without the right to marry, one is excluded from the full range of human experience and is denied “full protection of the laws for one’s avowed commitment to an intimate and lasting relationship.”171 The jurisprudence which has emanated from the US Courts indicates that the right to marry is recognised as a fundamental right because of the benefi ts (both expressive and material) attached to it. 181. Entry 5 of the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution grants both the State legislature and Parliament the power to enact laws with respect to marriage. The provision reads as follows: “Marriage and divorce; infants and minors; adoption; wills, intestacy and succession; joint family and partition; all matters in respect of 167 In Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S 1, 12 (1967), the US Supreme Court invalidated bans on inter-racial unions holding that marriage is one of the vital personal rights essential to the ly pursuit of happiness by free men; In Turner v. Safl ey, 482 U.S. 78, 95(1987) the US Supreme Court held that the right to marry was abridged by regulations limiting the privilege of prison inmates to marry. 168 Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S 535 169 Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S 374 170 Loving v. Virginia, 388 US 1 171 Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass.2003) 133 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. which parties in judicial proceedings were immediately before the commencement of this Constitution subject to their personal law.” (emphasis supplied) 182. In pursuance of the power conferred by Articles 245 and 246 read with Entry 5 of the Concurrent List, Parliament has enacted laws creating and regulating the socio-legal institution of marriage. The State legislatures have made amendments to such laws with the assent of the President, since the subject of marriage is in the Concurrent list. The petitioners seek that the Court recognise the right to marry as a fundamental right. As explained above, this would mean that even if Parliament and the State legislatures have not created an institution of marriage in exercise of their powers under Entry 5 of the Concurrent list, they would be obligated to create an institution because of the positive postulate encompassed in the right to marry. This argument cannot be accepted. 183. As explained in the previous section, the State through the instrument of law characterises marriage with two constituent elements: the expressive component and the material component. Marriage may not have attained the social and legal signifi cance it currently has if the State had not regulated it through law. Thus, while marriage is not fundamental in itself, it may have attained signifi cance because of the benefi ts which are realised through regulation. 184. This Court in Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) (supra) while holding that privacy is a fundamental right was not guided by the content given to privacy by the State.
