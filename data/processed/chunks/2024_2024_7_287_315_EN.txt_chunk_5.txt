4.7. In view of the above, appellant did not deduct any TDS from the liquor vendors. 4.8. Assessing officer issued notices dated 26.10.2000 calling upon the assessee to show cause as to why it should not 294 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports pay the requisite TDS amount which it had failed to collect from the “buyers” i.e. the excise contractors for the financial years relevant to the assessment years under consideration. It appears that the assessee had submitted its reply to such notice. Thereafter, the assessing officer passed s dated 17.01.2001 under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act for the assessment years under consideration. As pointed out earlier, by the aforesaid s, the assessee was directed to pay certain sums of money as TDS which it had failed to collect from the liquor vendors or contractors. Following such s, consequential demand notices for the respective assessment years under Section 156 of the Income Tax Act were also issued to the assessee by the assessing officer. 4.9. Mysore Sales filed writ petitions before the High Court. While the main contention was that Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act was not applicable to it, a corollary issue raised was that before passing the under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act, no opportunity of hearing was given to it. Therefore, there was violation of the principles of natural justice. Learned Single Judge vide the and dated 27.10.2023 dismissed the writ petitions confirming the s passed under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act. 4.10. Thereafter, Mysore Sales and others preferred writ appeals before the Division Bench. However, by the and dated 13.03.2006, the writ appeals were dismissed by affirming the s passed by the assessing officer and also that of the learned Single Judge. 5. Aggrieved by the aforesaid, SLP(C) No. 12524 of 2006 was preferred. After leave was granted on 23.04.2007, the same came to be registered as Civil Appeal No. 2168 of 2007. 6. Sh. Avishkar Singhvi, learned AAG appearing for the appellant submits that Section 206C of the Income Tax Act is not applicable in respect of Mysore Sales which is a public sector undertaking controlled by the Government of Karnataka. In fact, it is a government company. It is engaged in the manufacture of arrack. Arrack is bottled under the supervision of the Excise Commissioner. Whatever arrack is manufactured, the same belongs to the state government alone. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 295 The Excise Commissioner Karnataka & Anr. v. Mysore Sales International Ltd. & Ors. Excise buyers i.e. liquor contractors do not obtain any arrack in auction. They only obtain the right/licence to carry out retail vending of arrack. Therefore, such contractors are not “buyers” as defined in the Explanation under Section 206C of the Income Tax Act. 6.1. Learned AAG argued that what is disposed of in the auction is the retail or vending right of arrack and not auctioning of the arrack itself. The final sale of arrack is carried out by the contractors at the retail price fixed by the government.
