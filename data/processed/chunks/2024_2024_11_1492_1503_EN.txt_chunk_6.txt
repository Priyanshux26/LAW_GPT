Here again, the State law must give way to any subsequent Parliamentary law which adds to, amends, varies or repeals the law made by the legislature of the State, by virtue of the operation of Article 254(2) proviso.” (underlining by us) 9.3 It is noted that the T.P. Act, 1882,which is a pre-Independence statute,has been adopted vide Adaptation of Laws , 1950. Consequently, the said Act has to be read within the scope and ambit of Entry 6 List III which is in the Concurrent List. When any subject is within the scope and ambit of the concurrent list, both the Parliament as well as the State Legislature have the legislative competence to make laws on the said subject. In the instant case, by virtue of the said legislative competence to make laws on the said subject, the U.P. Legislature amended Section 106 with effect from 30.11.1954, which had been in operation. However, with effect from 31.12.2002, the Parliamentary amendment would apply. This is because of the proviso to Clause 2 of Article 254 which would apply to the facts of the present case. 9.4 Consequently, the U.P. amendment to Section 106 would pale into insignificance owing to implied repugnancy and inconsistency between the U.P. State amendment and the Parliamentary 1502 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports amendment to Section 106 of the T.P. Act in the year 2003 even if the earlier U.P. amendment had been reserved for consideration of the President and had received the Presidential assent. Thus, on the Parliament amending a provision subsequent to a State legislature’s amendment of a provision of law found in the Concurrent List, the Parliamentary amendment would apply. Article 254 is an instance of Parliamentary supremacy. 9.5 Thus, the subject “transfer of property other than agricultural land” is one which falls within the scope and ambit of Entry 6, List III as noted above and both the Parliament and the State Legislatures have legislative competence to make laws on the said subject including enacting an amendment to any provision of the T.P. Act. If an amendment is made to a provision of T.P. Act such as Section 106 in the instant case, by a State Legislature and the mandate of sub-clause (2) of Article 254 is complied with by the State, then any inconsistency between the State law and the Parliamentary law would result in State law prevailing in the State. 9.6 In the instant case, it is noted that the Legislature of State of U.P. amended Section 106 by amendment dated 30.11.1954 by which the words “fifteen days’ notice”in Section 106 of the T.P. Act were substituted by “thirty days’ notice” and the substituted clause prevailed in the State of U.P. However, in view of the amendment made to Section 106 by the Parliament by Act 3 of 2003 with effect from 31.12.2002, the substitution in Section 106 made by the Legislature of the State of U.P. is impliedly repealed and Section 106 as amended with effect from 31.12.2002 by the Parliament, would apply.
