18. The next step is to see whether an Additional Director General of the DRI who has been appointed as an officer of Customs, under the notification dated 7-3-2002, has been entrusted with the functions under Section 28 as a proper officer under the Customs Act. In support of the contention that he has been so entrusted with the functions of a proper officer under Section 28 of the Customs Act, Shri Sanjay Jain, Learned Additional Solicitor General relied on a Notification No. 40/2012, dated 2-5-2012 issued by the Central Board of Excise and Customs. The notification confers various functions referred to in Column (3) of the notification under the Customs Act on officers referred to in Column (2). The relevant part of the notification reads as follows :- “[To be published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, Part I, Section 3, Sub-section (i)] Government of India Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue) Notification No. 40/2012-Customs (N.T.) New Delhi, dated the 2nd May, 2012 260 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports S.O. (E). - In exercise of the powers conferred by subsection (34) of section 2 of the Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962), the Central Board of Excise and Customs, hereby assigns the officers and above the rank of officers mentioned in Column (2) of the Table below, the functions as the proper officers in relation to the various sections of the Customs Act, 1962, given in the corresponding entry in Column (3) of the said Table :- Sl. No. Designation of the officers Functions under Section of the Customs Act, 1962 (1) (2) (3) Commissioner of Customs (i) Section 33 Additional Commissioner (i) Sub-section (5) or Joint Commissioner of of section 46; and Customs (ii) Section 149 Deputy Commissioner or (i) ….. (ii) ….. (iii) Assistant Commissioner ….. (iv)….. (v) ….. of Customs and Central (vi) Section 28; Excise ………” 19. It appears that a Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner of Customs has been entrusted with the functions under Section 28, vide Sl. No. 3 above. By reason of the fact that the functions are assigned to officers referred to in Column (3) and those officers above the rank of officers mentioned in Column (2), the Commissioner of Customs would be included as an officer entitled to perform the function under Section 28 of the Act conferred on a Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner but the notification appears to be ill-founded. The notification is purported to have been issued in exercise of powers under sub-section (34) of Section 2 of the Customs Act. This section does not confer any powers on any authority to entrust any functions to officers. The sub-Section is part of the definitions clause of the Act, it merely defines a proper officer, it reads as follows :- [2024] 12 S.C.R. 261 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. “2. Definitions. - In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, - … 136/163 https://www. mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.33099 of 2015 & etc., (34) ‘proper officer’, in relation to any functions to be performed under this Act, means the officer of customs who is assigned those functions by the Board or the Principal Commissioner of Customs or Commissioner of Customs.” 20.
