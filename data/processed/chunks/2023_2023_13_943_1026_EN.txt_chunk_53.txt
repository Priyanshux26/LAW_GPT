20-23). A provision that penalizes or prohibits one party from enforcing the terms of their agreement directly undermines the administration of justice. There is nothing novel about the proposition that contracting parties, as a matter of public policy, cannot oust the court’s supervisory jurisdiction to resolve contractual disputes (see e.g. Kill v. Hollister, (1746) 1 Wils. K.B. 129 : 95 E.R. 532; Scott v. Avery, (1856) 5 H.L.C. 811 : 10 E.R. 1121; Deuterium of Canada Ltd. v. Burns & Roe Inc., [1975] 2 SCR 124). Indeed, irrespective of the value placed on freedom of contract, 101 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. courts have consistently held that a contracting party’s right to legal recourse is “a right inalienable even by the concurrent will of the parties” (Scott, at p. 1133). 111. This head of public policy serves to uphold the rule of law, which, at a minimum, guarantees Canadian citizens and residents “a stable, predictable and ed society in which to conduct their aff airs” (Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 SCR 217, at para. 70). Such a guarantee is meaningless without access to an independent judiciary that can vindicate legal rights. The rule of law, accordingly, requires that citizens have access to a venue where they can hold one another to account (Jonsson v. Lymer, 2020 ABCA 167, at para. 10 (CanLII)). Indeed, “[t]here cannot be a rule of law without access, otherwise the rule of law is replaced by a rule of men and women who decide who shall and who shall not have access to justice” (B.C.G.E.U. v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1988] 2 SCR 214, at p. 230). Unless private parties can enforce their legal rights and publicly adjudicate their disputes, “the rule of law is threatened and the development of the common law undermined” (Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7 : [2014] 1 SCR 87, at para. 26). Access to civil justice is paramount to the public legitimacy of the law and the legitimacy of the judiciary as the institution of the state that expounds and applies the law. 112. Access to civil justice is a precondition not only to a functioning democracy but also to a vibrant economy, in part because access to justice allows contracting parties to enforce their agreements. A contract that denies one party the right to enforce its terms undermines both the rule of law and commercial certainty. That such an agreement is contrary to public policy is not a manifestation of judicial idiosyncrasies, but rather an instance of the self-evident proposition that there is no value in a contract that cannot be enforced. Thus, the harm to the public that would result from holding contracting parties to a bargain they cannot enforce is “substantially incontestable” (Millar Estate, at p. 7, quoting Fender, at p. 12). It really is this simple : unless everyone has reasonable access to the law and its processes where necessary to vindicate legal rights, we will live in a society LOMBARDI ENGINEERING LTD. v.
