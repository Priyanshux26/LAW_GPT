I am accordingly of opinion that this rule should be made absolute and the convictions and sentences passed on the petitioners should be set aside and the fines if paid by them should be refunded. It will be open to the prosecution to proceed afresh against the petitioners in respect of the charges under Ss. 384 and 384/114, I.P.C. or even as regards the charge under S. 120-B, I.P.C. provided that the requisite sanction under S. 196-A, Criminal P. C. has been duly obtained. Such retrial, if it is to take place, will be held before some Magistrate other than the learned Magistrate who has already dealt with this case. Rule made absolute.” (emphasis supplied) SUBMISSIONS 28. Mr. S.V. Raju, learned ASG appearing for the appellant submitted that as the Act, 2019 had come into force, the impugned is liable to be set aside. 29. Per contra, Mr. D. Mahesh Babu, learned counsel appearing for the respondents, by placing reliance upon the written arguments submitted that the impugned correctly dealt with the legal position which was prevailing at the relevant time. When the complaint was conveyed, the CrPC, 1989 was in force. The repealing took place thereafter. The retrospective application of a procedural law is fairly well settled, and the procedure cannot 1072 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports be made retrospectively applicable. Even the Act, 2019 does not specifically state that the CrPC, 1973 will apply retrospectively. On a conjoint reading of Section 103 of the Act, 2019, along with the , 2019, with particular reference to Para 2(13)(d), it is abundantly clear that the CrPC, 1989 ought to have been applied, as there was no dispute with respect to the non-compliance, which was duly recorded by the Court. Therefore, the impugned will have to be sustained. DISCUSSION 30. As stated, CrPC, 1989 stood repealed with effect from 31.10.2019 (i.e. the appointed day). On the very same day, the Act, 2019 came into existence. Therefore, the submission of Mr. S.V. Raju, that there is no need for getting the appropriate sanction or empowerment as mandated under Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 cannot be countenanced. 31. There is nothing to infer either from the Act, 2019 or the , 2019 that CrPC, 1973 will have a retrospective application. However, the , 2019 did take into consideration all the difficulties that might arise by facilitating the continuance thereunder. We have no difficulty in holding that while an investigation could continue after its initiation under the CrPC, 1989, by way of the application of the CrPC, 1973, it cannot be stated that even for a case where there was a clear non-compliance of the former, it can be ignored by the application of the latter. 32. Para 2(13) confers sufficient power on the investigating agency to deal with such a situation. While we are holding that the requirement of an authorization or an empowerment is mandatory for conveying a complaint, it being at the conclusion of investigation, would not preclude the investigating agency from complying with it thereafter.
