It can further be seen that the CCEA has also taken a decision that CIL may import coal to D meet its balance FSA obligations and supply the same to the willing TPPs on cost plus basis. TPPs may also be permitted to import coal themselves. It further provided that the higher cost of imported coal was to be considered for pass-through as per the modalities suggested by the CERC. E 75. In pursuance thereof, the Government of India, through MoC, issued Office Memorandum dated 26th July 2013. The said Office Memorandum reads thus: “Sub: New Coal Distribution Policy - further instructions regarding implementation thereof. F The New Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP) was issued vide this Ministry’s Office Memorandum NO. 23011/4/2007-CPD dated 18.10.2007, laying down the guidelines for distribution and pricing of coal to various sectors. As per para 2.2 of the said policy, Power Utilities including Independent Power Producer were to be supplied 100 per cent of the quantity as per their normative G requirement through Fuel Supply Agreement(s) (FSAs) by Coal India Limited (CIL) at fixed prices to be declared/notified by CIL. As per para 5.2, in to meet the domestic requirement, CIL was to import coal as required from time to time, if feasible and adjust the overall price accordingly. H 122 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A 2. Government has now approved a revised arrangement for supply of coal to the identified Thermal Power Stations (TPPs) of 78,000 MW capacity commissioned or likely to be commissioned during the period from 01.04.2009 to 31.03.2015. Taking into account the overall domestic availability and the likely actual requirements of these TPPs, it has been decided that FSAs will B be signed for the domestic coal quantity of 65%, 65%, 67% and 75% of ACQ for the remaining four years of the 12th Plan for the power plants having normal coal linkages. Cases of tapering linkage would get coal supplies as per the Tapering Linkage Police. To meet its balance FSA obligations towards the requirement of C the said 78,000 MW TPPs, CIL may import coal and supply the same to the willing power plants on cost plus basis. Power plants may also directly import coal themselves, if they so opt, in which case, the FSA obligations on the part of CIL to the extent of import component would be deemed to have been discharged. D 3. Para 2.2 and 5.2 of the New Coal Distribution Policy issued vide OM No. 23011/4/2007-CPD dated 18.10.2007 stand modified to the above extent. 4. The above guidelines will also be applicable to the distribution of coal from Singreni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL). E 5. CIL and its subsidiaries and SCCL are advised to take further action accordingly.” 76. It can thus be seen that the NCDP 2013 also specifically states that, as per NCDP 2007 and specifically paragraph 2.2 thereof, Power Utilities, including IPPs, were to be supplied 100% of the quantity F as per their normative requirement through FSAs by CIL at fixed prices to be declared/notified by CIL.
