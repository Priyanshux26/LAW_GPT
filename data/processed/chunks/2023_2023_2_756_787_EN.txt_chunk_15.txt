A at the various premises of H.N. Safal Group (searched person) and the assessment s were the subject matter of appeal before the High Court. 9. In light of the aforesaid facts, the question of law, which arises for consideration of this Court is, “Whether amendment brought to Section B 153C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 vide Finance Act, 2015 would be applicable to searches conducted under Section 132 of the Act, 1961 before 01.06.2015, i.e., the date of amendment”, is required to be considered. 10. While considering the aforesaid question, the reason and the C object and purpose of the amendment to Section 153C introduced vide Finance Act, 2015 w.e.f. 01.06.2015 is required to be considered. 10.1 As observed hereinabove, in the pre-amended Section 153C, the words used were “belongs or belong to” a person other than the searched person. In the case of Pepsico India Holdings Private D Limited (supra), the Delhi High Court interpreted the expression “belong to” and observed and held that there is a difference and distinction between “belong to” and “pertain to”. It was observed and held that on the basis of the registered sale deed seized from the premises of the searched person, it cannot be said that it “belongs to” the vendor. Therefore, the High Court view gave a very narrow and restrictive E meaning to the expression / word “belongs to” and held that the ingredients of Section 153C have not been satisfied. To remove the basis of the observation made by the Delhi High Court in the case of Pepsico India Holdings Private Limited (supra), now, Section 153C came to be amended w.e.f. 01.06.2015 by substituting the words “belongs or F belong to” with the words “pertains or pertain to” insofar as the books of account and documents are concerned. Thus, having found that the observation made by the Delhi High Court in the case of Pepsico India Holdings Private Limited (supra) led to a situation where, though incriminating material pertaining to third party was found during the search proceedings under Section 132, the Revenue could not proceed against G the third parties, it was observed that the said observation made by the Delhi High Court in the aforesaid decision was coming in the way of suppressing the very mischief which the legislature intended to suppress, which necessitated the amendment in Section 153C. Thus, it is a case of substitution of the words by way of amendment. H INCOME TAX OFFICER v. VIKRAM SUJITKUMAR BHATIA 777 [M. R. SHAH, J.] 10.2 At this stage, the first proviso to Section 153C of the Act, A 1961 is required to be referred to.
