However, while doing so, this Court cannot affect the substantive rights of those litigants who are not parties to the case before it. The right to be heard 138 [1998] 2 SCR 795 : (1998) 4 SCC 409 [47. […] It, however, needs to be remembered that the powers conferred on the Court by Article 142 being curative in nature cannot be construed as powers which authorise the Court to ignore the substantive rights of a litigant while dealing with a cause pending before it. This power cannot be used to “supplant” substantive law applicable to the case or cause under consideration of the Court. Article 142, even with the width of its amplitude, cannot be used to build a new edifice where none existed earlier, by ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with a subject and thereby to achieve something indirectly which cannot be achieved directly.] 139 Allahabad High Court Bar Association v. State of U P (2024) 6 SCC 267 1694 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports before an adverse is passed is not a matter of procedure but a substantive right.” (emphasis supplied) 85. In M Siddiq v. Suresh Das,140 a Constitution Bench observed that Article 142 embodies the concept of justice, equity, and good conscience. This Court further observed that Article 142 empowers the court to pass an which accords with justice: “1026. The extraordinary constitutional power to pass any decree or an which, in the opinion of this Court is necessary for doing complete justice embodies the idea that a court must, by necessity, be empowered to craft outcomes that ensure a just outcome. When a court is presented before it with hard cases, they follow an interpretation of the law that best fits and justifies the existing legal landscape — the Constitution, statutes, rules, regulations, customs and common law. Where exclusive rule-based theories of law and adjudication are inadequate to explain either the functioning of the system or create a relief that ensures complete justice, it is necessary to supplement such a model with principles grounded in equitable standards. The power under Article 142 however is not limitless. It authorises the Court to pass s to secure complete justice in the case before it. Article 142 embodies both the notion of justice, equity and good conscience as well as a supplementary power to the Court to effect complete justice.” (emphasis supplied) 86. The exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 142 is meant to supplement the existing legal framework to do complete justice between the parties.141 In a given circumstance, this Court can supplement a legal framework to craft a just outcome when strict adherence to a source of law and exclusive rule-based theories create inequitable results.142 140 [2019] 18 SCR 1 : (2020) 1 SCC 1 [1023] 141 Vinay Chandra Mishra, In re (1995) 2 SCC 584 [46]; Delhi Development Authority v.
