The counsel submitted that the Share Purchase Agreements (SPAs) were to be executed to facilitate the implementation of Clauses 2.1.4 and 2.1.6 respectively of the FAA and the SRG Group would have been a party to the SPAs. This is evident from the draft SPAs and the same were forwarded specifically to the respondent No.9 vide email dated 27.11.2020. That according to the dispute resolution clause contained in Clauses 7.1 and 7.2 respectively, disputes between or amongst any of the parties in connection with or arising out of the Transaction Documents can be amicably resolved and upon its failure, be resolved by arbitration.

In addition to that, the description and obligation of the parties under the FAA is also irrelevant since most cases of non- signatory parties will involve agreements, the terms of which do not expressly include the non-signatory. In support of the aforesaid, the counsel placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Sasan Power Ltd. v. North American Coal Corporation (India) Private Ltd. reported in (2016) 10 SCC 813 where it was settled that the nomenclature of an agreement is not determinative of its character. 32. The counsel submitted that while on many occasions the representatives of JRS Group were there to take care of the interests, suggestions and comments of the SRG Group, it was understood by all the parties that the SRG Group although not a signatory to the FAA yet would be a part of the execution of and compliance of the terms and conditions thereof. Therefore, there was commonality of subject matter and composite transactions, in view of which SRG is a veritable party liable to be referred to arbitration. 33.
