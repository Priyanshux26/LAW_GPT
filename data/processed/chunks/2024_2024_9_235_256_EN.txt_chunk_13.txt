28. In Shashi Prakash Khemka (Dead) through legal representatives and another vs. NEPC MICON (Now NEPC India Limited) and others,5 this Court again had occasion to deal with exercise of power under Section 111-A of the Companies Act, 1956. The Company Law Board’s view had been reversed by the Madras High Court in appeal, whereby the appellants were relegated to the remedy of a civil suit in relation to the issue raised qua the transfer of shares. This Court took note of the earlier in Ammonia Supplies Corporation (P) Ltd. (supra) but noted that Section 430 of the Act of 2013 barred the jurisdiction of the civil court and opined that the effect thereof is that, in matters in respect of which power has been conferred on the National Company Law Tribunal, the jurisdiction 3 [2015] 11 SCR 323 : (2016) 1 SCC 423 4 [2018] 5 SCR 200 : (2018) 7 SCC 709 5 (2019) 18 SCC 569 252 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of the civil court is completely barred. This Court observed that it is not in dispute that, were a dispute to arise today, remedy of a civil suit would be completely barred and the power would vest with the National Company Law Tribunal under Section 59 of the Companies Act, 2013. Noting that the cause of action in that case had arisen at a stage prior to enactment of the Act of 2013, this Court was of the view that relegating the parties to a civil suit would not be the appropriate remedy, considering the manner in which Section 430 of the Act of 2013 was widely worded. 29. Shashi Prakash Kemka (supra) was followed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi, in Smiti Golyan and others vs. Nulon India Ltd. and others6 whereby, the decision of the National Company Law Tribunal, Principal Bench, in relation to rectification proceedings was upheld without relegating the parties to the civil court. Civil Appeal No. 4639 of 2019 filed before this Court against Smiti Golyan (supra) was dismissed on 03.07.2019 and this Court observed that the findings recorded by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal were absolutely proper and no ground was made out to interfere with the same. 30. Thereafter, in IFB Agro Industries Limited vs. SICGIL India Limited and others,7 this Court considered the appropriate forum for adjudication and determination of violations and consequential action thereon under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992. It was observed that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was conferred with regulatory jurisdiction, which included ex-ante powers to predict possible violations and take preventive measures. This Court held that the role of SEBI as a regulator could not be circumvented by applying for rectification under Section 111-A of the Act of 1956 and that, such an approach would be impermissible as scrutiny and examination of a transaction allegedly conducted in violation of the Regulations has to be processed through the rules and remedies provided in the Regulations themselves.
