On the other end of the C scale, younger persons were left relatively unscathed, having served between 3 years and 11 months. [Para 15][81-G; 82-A, B] 2. The impugned , in this court’s opinion, fell into error in not considering the gravity of the offence. Having held all the accused criminally liable, under Section 304 Part II read D with Section 149 IPC and also not having found any distinguishing feature in the form of separate roles played by each of them, the imposition of the “sentence undergone” criteria, amounted to an aberration, and the sentencing is for that reason, flawed. This court is, therefore, of the view that given the totality of circumstances (which includes the fact that the accused have been E at large for the past four years), the appropriate sentence would be five years rigorous imprisonment. However, at the same time, the court is cognizant of the fact A-1 and A-6 served more than that period. Therefore, the impugned , as far as they are concerned, is left undisturbed.
