[Paras 52, 60, 62, 64, 66, 70, 72] Environment – India’s obligations, commitment under international conventions towards preventing climate change and tackling its adverse effects – United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Kyoto Protocol; Paris Agreement – Key features of India’s commitment – Discussed. Environment – Importance of solar power as a source of renewable energy – National Solar Mission; National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency, National Mission for a Green India; National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change – Urgent need to shift to solar power – Discussed. Environment – Right to a healthy environment; Right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change – Constitution of India – Articles 14, 21, 48A, 51A(g): Held: Despite governmental policy and rules and regulations recognising the adverse effects of climate change and seeking to combat it, there is no single or umbrella legislation in India which relates to climate change and the attendant concerns – However, this does not mean that the people of India do not have a right against the adverse effects of climate change – Importance of the environment, as indicated by Article 48A, Article 51A(g) of the Constitution of India, becomes a right in other parts of the Constitution – Article 21 recognises the right to life and personal liberty while Article 14 indicates that all persons shall have equality before law and the 1322 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports equal protection of laws – These articles are important sources of the right to a clean environment and the right against the adverse effects of climate change – Despite a plethora of decisions on the right to a clean environment, some decisions which recognise climate change as a serious threat, and national policies which seek to combat climate change, it is yet to be articulated that the people have a right against the adverse effects of climate change – This is perhaps because this right and the right to a clean environment are two sides of the same coin – As the havoc caused by climate change increases year by year, it becomes necessary to articulate this as a distinct right – It is recognised by Articles 14 and 21 – Further, the right to health (a part of the right to life under Article 21) is impacted due to factors such as air pollution, shifts in vector-borne diseases, rising temperatures, droughts, shortages in food supplies due to crop failure, storms, and flooding – If climate change and environmental degradation lead to acute food and water shortages in a particular area, poorer communities will suffer more than richer ones – The right to equality would undoubtedly be impacted in each of these instances – There is a right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change – While giving effect to this right, courts must be alive to other rights of affected communities such as the right against displacement and allied rights – India faces a number of pressing near-term challenges that directly impact the right to a healthy environment, particularly for vulnerable and indigenous communities including forest dwellers – The importance of prioritizing clean energy initiatives to ensure environmental sustainability and uphold human rights obligations cannot be understated – The right to a healthy environment encapsulates the principle that every individual has the entitlement to live in an environment that is clean, safe, and conducive to their well-being – It is imperative for states like India, to uphold their obligations under international law, including their responsibilities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to climate impacts, and protect the fundamental rights of all individuals to live in a healthy and sustainable environment.
