The discussion as above with reference to Section 307, IPC, would thus go to show that imposition of rigorous imprisonment for a term of 14 years for a conviction under Section 307, IPC, is impermissible in law and it is liable to be interfered with. Since the High Court had not gone into the question as to how imprisonment for a term of 14 years or the conviction under Section 307, IPC would be maintained and in view of our conclusion as above, the of the High Court confirming the of the trial Court awarding rigorous imprisonment for 14 years calls for interference. 8. Since the conviction of the appellants under Section 307, IPC, is declined to be interfered with by us, necessarily the punishment for the said offence taking note of the gravity of the crime has to be imposed. Since we are not proposing to enhance the sentence to imprisonment for life and the only option is to bring down the term of imprisonment from 14 years, there is absolutely no reason to hear the appellants in-person. 9. We have taken note of the fact that as a consequence of the attempt to do away with the life of the complainant, he had suffered spine injury and became paralysed in terms of the second part of the Section 307, IPC, the appellants are to be given the maximum corporeal sentence imposable under the first part of Section 307, 762 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports IPC. Accordingly, the imposition of rigorous imprisonment for 14 years each to the appellants is converted to rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years. The of sentence with respect to fine is kept intact. The appeal is thus allowed in part and the impugned of the High Court and the of the trial Court in S.T. No.281/2016 qua the appellants stands modified as above. 10. Pending applications, if any, stands disposed of. Result of the case: Criminal Appeal partly allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Swathi H.
