Section 182 of the Companies Act 2013 substantively incorporated the provisions of Section 293-A of the 1956 Act, as amended in 1985. Section 182 enables a company to contribute any amount directly or indirectly to any political party. The provision bars a Government company and a company which has been in existence for less than three financial years from contributing to a political party. The provisos to the provision prescribe the following two conditions: a. The aggregate of the amount contributed by the company in any financial year shall not exceed seven and a half per cent of its average net profits during the three immediately preceding financial years;’° and b. A contribution can be made only if the Board of Directors issues a resolution authorizing the contribution at a meeting. Such a resolution shall, subject to the other provisions of the Section, be deemed to be a justification in law for the making and acceptance of the contribution authorized by the Board." Sub-section (3) of Section 182 mandates every company to disclose in its profit and loss account any amount contributed by it to any political party during the financial year with specific particulars of the total amount contributed along with the name of the political party to which the contribution was made. Section 182 of the Companies Act 2013 made two modifications from Section 293-A of the Companies Act 1956: (a) the cap on the contributions which can be made by companies was increased from 5 % to 7.5% of their average net profits; and (b) more stringent consequences for violation of were imposed. The fine was extendable to five times (instead of three times prescribed in the earlier provision) of the contribution. 10 Companies Act, First proviso to Section 182(1). 11 Companies Act, second proviso to Section 182(1) 456 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
