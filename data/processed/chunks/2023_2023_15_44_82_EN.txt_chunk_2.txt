[Paras 61, 86(iv)] Civil Services Examination Rules, 2022 – r.13 – Petitioners argued that being from the “EWS” category is a status and thus, the Income and Asset Certifi cate (I&AC) to be produced was only a proof and could have been produced at any stage: Held: Such argument cannot be accepted in the teeth of the clear prescription in the Offi ce Memoranda r/w the CSE-2022 Rules – Further, as required u/r.13, at the stage of Detailed Application Form–I (DAF-I), the document had to be submitted on-line before the prescribed date (for CSE-2022, the date was 15.07.2022) and that any delay in submission of DIVYA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 47 DAF-I or document beyond the prescribed date was not allowed – These clear stipulations run counter to the submissions that on the rectifi cation of a certifi cate it relates back to the date of the certifi cate. [Para 41] Service Law – Appointment/Recruitment/Selection – Date on which the eligibility should be possessed: Held: If there are relevant rules which prescribe the date on which the eligibility should be possessed, those rules will prevail – In the absence of rules or any other date prescribed in the prospectus/advertisement for determining the eligibility, there is a judicial chorus holding that it would be the last date for submission of the application – Civil Services Examination Rules, 2022. [Para 46] Service Law – Appointment/Recruitment/Selection – Selective Relaxation – Impermissibility: Held: Determination of eligibility cannot be left uncertain till the fi nal stages of selection, since that would lead to uncertainty – Further, if rules prescribe the last date on which eligibility should be possessed, any relaxation would prejudice non-applicants who for want of possession of eligibility would not have applied – Relaxation would then be selective, leading to discrimination – In the present case, rules clearly exist in the form of CSE-2022 – As is clear from r.13, by 15.07.2022, the certifi cates disclosing eligibility had to be uploaded with Detailed Application Form–I (DAF-I) and it was expressly stipulated that delayed submission of the DAF-I or documents in support will not be allowed – Further, much water has also fl own under the bridge – The UPSC has made the cadre allocations and the EWS candidates against the 298 vacancies have also been allotted their respective cadres – Accepting the contention of the petitioners would also result in administrative chaos and will prolong the selection process indefi nitely – It is legally not permissible and administratively not feasible for the UPSC – Civil Services Examination Rules, 2022 – r.13 . [Paras 51-53] Service Law – Appointment/Recruitment/Selection – Decision of the Selecting Body – Interference with – Impermissible – Petitioners argued that with regard to four candidates there was relaxation inasmuch as they were allowed to rectify the defects in the EWS and I&AC: 48 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Held: UPSC considered these omissions as trivial and as not going to the root of the eligibility, unlike in the case of the petitioners herein – In the present case, it did not consider the defects as insignifi cant – Thus, this Court has no option but to reject the writ petitions of all the petitioners – Neither the Offi ce Memorandum nor the rules in question can be construed as directory – They clearly prescribe the eligibility criterion, the date before which the certifi cate should be possessed and submitted – They also prescribe the consequence for the omission – The petitioners who did not possess the valid documentation determining their eligibility, before the prescribed cut-off date, cannot complain, if their claim for categorization as EWS was rejected – UPSC justifi ed in denying the petitioners the benefi t of categorization as EWS candidates – Civil Services Examination Rules, 2022.
