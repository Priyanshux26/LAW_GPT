813 Bilkis Yakub Rasool v. Union of India & Others Mumbai, learned counsel went on to refute the claim of the learned Additional Solicitor-General that the relevant opinion would be that of the Presiding Judge of the Godhra Court who was convinced of the merits of grant of remission. That this contention of learned ASG would contradict the plain language of Section 432(2) which specifies that the Presiding Judge should have been the one who awarded or confirmed the sentence. Reliance was again placed on the s of this Court in Sangeet, Ram Chander and V. Sriharan. Learned counsel further contended that the submission of the learned ASG that the use of the word ‘may’ in Section 432(2) would imply that there is no necessary requirement to seek the opinion of the Presiding Judge is erroneous in light of the dictum of this Court in V.Sriharan. 16.2. It was next contended that a letter dated 17.11.2021 was filed along with the application dated 10.08.2022. The said letter by the State of Gujarat addressed to the State of Maharashtra detailed that the State of Gujarat possessed no powers of remission with respect to respondent No.3 and that the appropriate government in this respect would be the State of Maharashtra. Despite taking this view, which is in accordance with the position of law laid down by this Court in various cases, including V. Sriharan, no review petition was filed by the State challenging the 13.05.2022 . 16.3. It was next submitted that the learned Additional Solicitor- General had placed on record the opinion of the CBI dated 09.07.2022 wherein, after an apparent change of mind, grant of remission to respondent Nos.3 to 13 was recommended. That neither of the documents, namely, the letter of the State of Gujarat and the changed opinion of the CBI find any mention in the counter-affidavit filed by the State on 17.10.2022. It was further submitted that these additional documents establish the rapid timeline of the process adopted by the Central Government in affirming the s of remission, as the State Government’s communication was received on 06.07.2022, the opinion of the CBI was sought and received on 09.07.2022 and the Central Government expressed its concurrence on 11.07.2022. 814 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 16.4. It was further contended that respondent No.3 produced a document dated 18.06.2022 during the course of his arguments, stating that the same was the opinion of the Presiding Judge of the Mumbai Special Court (CBI). However, the veracity of the said document cannot be established as the State claimed to be not in possession of and is entirely unaware of the same. 16.5. Learned counsel reiterated that the above facts reveal non- application of mind and the mechanical manner in which the s of remission were passed in the instant case. 16.6. Learned counsel for the petitioners next submitted that on 30.08.2023, the fine amounts owed were deposited by respondent Nos.3 to 13. That this is as an admission on their part of the non-payment of fine.
