01/2022, titled ‘Assistant Director, Directorate of Enforcement vs. Lalit Goyal and others’, against seven named accused, under Section 200 Cr.P.C read with Sections 44 and 45 of the Act of 2002. Notably, M3M Group and the appellants did not fi gure amongst those named accused. The number of FIRs had also increased from 13 to 30, as per this complaint. This case was numbered as COMA/01/2022, titled ‘Directorate of Enforcement vs. Lalit Goyal and others’, and was pending in the Court of Sudhir Parmar, Special Judge. At that stage, the Anti-Corruption Bureau, Panchkula, received information that Sudhir Parmar was showing favouritism to Lalit Goyal, the owner of IREO Group, and also to Roop Bansal and his brother, Basant Bansal, the owners of M3M Group. This led to the registration of 720 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. FIR No. 0006 dated 17.04.2023. On 12.05.2023, the ED issued summons to M3M India Pvt. Ltd., calling upon it to provide information and documents pertaining to transactions with certain companies. Thereafter, on 01.06.2023, the ED raided the properties of M3M Group and eff ected seizures of assets and bank accounts. Roop Bansal was arrested by the ED on 08.06.2023 apropos the fi rst ECIR. 5. Apprehending that action would be taken against them also in the context of the fi rst ECIR, Pankaj Bansal and Basant Bansal secured interim protection from the Delhi High Court in Bail Application Nos. 2030 and 2031 of 2023. By separate s dated 09.06.2023 passed therein, the Delhi High Court noted that Pankaj Bansal and Basant Bansal had not been named in the fi rst ECIR and that the ED had not yet been able to implicate them in any of the scheduled off ences under the Act of 2002. Further, the High Court noted that Pankaj Bansal had not even been summoned by the ED in that case. The High Court accordingly granted them interim protection by way of anticipatory bail, subject to conditions, till the next date of hearing, i.e., 05.07.2023. Special Leave Petition (Crl.) Nos. 7384 and 7396 of 2023 were fi led by the ED assailing the s dated 09.06.2023 before this Court and the same are stated to be pending. 6. In the meanwhile, on the basis of FIR No. 0006 dated 17.04.2023, the ED recorded another ECIR, viz., ECIR/GNZO/17/2023, on 13.06.2023 (hereinafter, ‘the second ECIR’) against: i). Mr. Sudhir Parmar; ii). Mr. Ajay Parmar; iii). Mr. Roop Bansal; and iv). others who are named in the FIR/unknown persons. However, summons were issued by the ED to Pankaj Bansal and Basant Bansal on 13.06.2023 at 06.15 pm in relation to the fi rst ECIR, requiring them to appear before the ED on 14.06.2023 at 11.00 am. Though the copy of the summons placed before this Court pertains to Pankaj Bansal alone, the email dated 13.06.2023 of the Assistant Director of the ED, bearing the time 06.15 pm, was addressed to both Pankaj Bansal and Basant Bansal and required their compliance with the summons on 14.06.2023 at 11 am.
