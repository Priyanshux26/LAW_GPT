B. Regulatory Regime 4. Electricity is a concurrent subject under the Constitution of India. Prior to the enactment of the Electricity Act 20032, the Electricity Act 19103 governed the supply and use of electrical energy in India. The E 1910 Act prescribed the legal framework for laying down cables and other works related to the supply of electricity. It also laid down a legal framework for supply of electrical energy and imposed certain responsibilities and obligations on persons licensed to supply electricity with a view to incentivise the growth of the electricity industry through private licensees. F 5. Section 2(c) of the 1910 Act defined “consumer” as any person supplied with energy by a licensee or any other person engaged in the business of supplying energy to the public under the Act, and included any person whose premises were for the time being connected for the purposes of receiving energy. Section 21(2) empowered a licensee to G make conditions to regulate their relations with persons who were or intend to become consumers. Section 22 obligated a licensee to supply 1 Civil Appeal Nos 5312-5313 of 2005 2 “2003 Act” 3 “1910 Act” H 654 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A electrical energy, on application, to every person within the area of supply on the same terms as those on which any other person in the same area was entitled. Section 24 empowered the licensee to disconnect the supply of electricity if any person neglected to pay any charge or sum for energy due to the licensee. B 6. The 1910 Act was found inadequate for a coordinated development of electricity and a “grid-system” in India. Therefore, the Electricity (Supply) Act 19484 was enacted for the rationalisation of the production and supply of electricity and for taking measures conducive to the development of electricity. The 1948 Act mandated the state governments to constitute State Electricity Boards under Section 5 and C entrusted them with the responsibility of administering the grid-system and arranging the supply of electricity in the state. Section 26 provided that, subject to the provisions of the Act, the Board shall have all the powers and the obligations of a licensee under the 1910 Act. Section 49 empowered the Boards to supply electricity to any person, not being a D licensee, on such terms and conditions as laid down by the Board. In terms of Section 70(2), the provisions of the 1948 Act were in addition to, and not in derogation of the 1910 Act. 7. Parliament enacted the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act 19985 with an aim to distance the government from determination of E tariffs. The 1998 Act created the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and enabled the state governments to create State Electricity Regulatory Commissions. 8. Parliament consolidated and harmonised the provisions of the 1910 Act, 1948 Act, and 1998 Act by enacting the 2003 Act. In the process, the 2003 Act repealed the aforesaid three legislations. The long F title of the 2003 Act reads as follows: “An Act to consolidate the laws relating to generation, transmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity and generally for taking measures conducive to development of electricity industry, promoting competition therein, protecting interests of consumers G and supply of electricity to all areas, rationalisation of electricity tariff, ensuring transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of efficient and environmentally benign policies, constitution of Central Electricity Authority, Regulatory Commissions and 4 “1948 Act” H 5 “1998 Act” K.
