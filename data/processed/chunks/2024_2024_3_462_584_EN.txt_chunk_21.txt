26. Doubts about the correctness of the decision in PV Narasimha Rao (supra) have been raised by this Court in several previous decisions as well. For instance, in Kalpana Mehta v. Union of India,15 one of us (D.Y. Chandrachud, J) observed: “221. The view of the minority was that the offence of bribery is made out against a bribe-taker either upon taking or agreeing to take money for a promise to act in a certain manner. Following this logic, S.C. Agrawal, J. held that the criminal liability of a Member of Parliament who accepts a bribe for speaking or giving a vote in Parliament arises independent of the making of the speech or the giving of the vote and hence is not a liability “in respect of anything said or any vote given” in Parliament. The correctness of the view in the of the majority does not fall for consideration in the present case. Should it become necessary in an appropriate case in future, a larger Bench may have to consider the issue.” (emphasis supplied) 27. Similar observations have been made by this Court in Raja Ram Pal v. Hon’ble Speaker, Lok Sabha.16 The Court has relied on the minority in several decisions, notably Kuldip Nayar v. Union of India.17 and Amarinder Singh v. Punjab Vidhan Sabha.18 As the correctness of the decision in PV Narasimha Rao (supra) did not directly arise in these cases the Court refrained from making a reference or conclusive observations about the correctness of this decision. However, the present case turns almost entirely on the law laid down in PV Narasimha Rao (supra). 15 [2018] 4 SCR 1 : (2018) 7 SCC 1 16 [2007] 1 SCR 317 : (2007) 3 SCC 184 17 (2006) 7 SCC 1 18 [2010] 4 SCR 1105 : (2010) 6 SCC 113 492 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 28. That the correctness of PV Narasimha Rao (supra) arises squarely in the facts of this case becomes clear from the impugned of the High Court. The High Court formulated the question for consideration to be “whether Article 194(2) of the Constitution of India confers any immunity on the Members of the Legislative Assembly for being prosecuted in a criminal court of an offence involving offer or acceptance of bribe.” This is the precise question that this Court adjudicated on in PV Narasimha Rao (supra) as well, in the context of Article 105(2). 29. Further, both the counsel for the appellant and the counsel for CBI relied on the reasoning in PV Narasimha Rao (supra). The High Court, in its analysis, held that since Article 194(2) is pari materia to Article 105(2), the law laid down in PV Narasimha Rao (supra) covers the field. The High Court relied on PV Narasimha Rao (supra) in holding that an MP who has not cast his vote is not covered by the immunity. Since the appellant did not vote as agreed, she was held not to be protected from immunity under Article 194(2).
