Second, the Respondents argued that a statute cannot be struck down as violating Article 14 merely because it does not encompass all classes, as the Parliament wields discretion in legislating for 113 Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vithal Rao (1973) 1 SCC 500 114 Subramanian Swamy v. CBI (2014) 8 SCC 682 1074 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports varying degrees of harm. Citing precedents such as the State of M.P. v. Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd115 and Clarence Pais v. Union of India,116 the Respondents countered the Petitioners’ arguments by asserting that Parliament can make reasonable classifications and enact different laws based on territorial basis, thus justifying the differential treatment in granting citizenship. Third, the Respondents argued that Assam’s unique situation, marked by historical conflict, warrants differential treatment under Section 6A, ensuring that equals are not treated unequally. In this light, the central issue that arises for our consideration is whether Section 6A contravenes Article 14 of the Constitution. 162. Article 14, as widely understood, guarantees that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India. Typically, a claim under Article 14 is brought forth by an individual contending that they have been unfairly excluded from the benefits or protection under law. However, the Petitioners’ argument diverges from this norm since they do not assert that they have been excluded from a benefit extended to similarly situated individuals. Instead, the Petitioners are contending that their rights under Article 14 are infringed because they alone have been statutorily compelled to bear the burden of Bangladeshi immigrants. Before examining whether Section 6A treats equals unequally, it is crucial to address whether the Petitioners have the locus to invoke a claim under Article 14 in the first place. (a) Maintainability under Article 14 163. A bare reading of Article 14 indicates that it confers individuals with equality before the law and is not restricted to mere equality for the benefits provided under law. This provision came to be interpreted in the State of W.B. v. Anwar Ali Sarkar.117 In this case, a 7-judge Bench of this Court dealt with the challenge against the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, which allowed the State government to refer certain offences to special courts. This Court noted that the procedure in such special courts was separate from the Code of Criminal Procedure and curtailed the rights of the accused. 115 State of M.P. v. Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd [1964] 6 SCR 846 116 Clarence Pais v. Union of India (2001) 4 SCC 325 117 State of W.B. v. Anwar Ali Sarkar (1952) 1 SCC 1, para 7. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1075 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 Accordingly, it held that since the Act singled out certain cases and imposed restrictions on them, it violated Article 14. For this, the Court enunciated the principle that as per Article 14, “all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed”.118 164.
