[V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN AND PANKAJ MITHAL, JJ.] Wakf – Suit land was declared as wakf property by Single C Judge – set aside by Division Bench – Held: Under the Muslim law, a wakf can be created in several ways but primarily by permanent dedication of any movable and immovable property by a person professing Islam for any purpose recognized by Muslim law as pious, religious or charitable purpose and in the D absence of such dedication, it can be presumed to have come into existence by long use – In the present case, on the admitted facts, the wakf by dedication of the suit land is ruled out – Further, there is even no concrete evidence on record to prove that the suit land prior to the year 1900 or 1867 was actually being used as a burial ground (kabristan) – Therefore, the alleged E use of the suit land as burial ground prior to 1900 or 1867 is not sufficient to establish a wakf by user in the absence of evidence to show that it was so used – Thus, it cannot constitute a wakf by user also – In the absence of any evidence of valid creation of a wakf in respect of the suit property either by F dedication or by usage, it cannot be recognized as a wakf so as to allow it to be continued as a wakf property irrespective of its use or disuse as a burial ground – Appeals lack merit and are dismissed – Tamil Nadu Estate (Abolition & Conversion into Ryotwari) Act 1948 – ss.11(a), 19A – Waqf Act, 1955 – ss.4, 5 – Madras Estate Land Act, 1908 – s.20A.

STATE OF TAMIL NADU qua non – In the instant case, there is no evidence on record that A before issuing notification u/s.5 of the 1954 Act, any procedure or the survey was conducted as contemplated by s.4 – In the absence of such a material, the mere issuance of the notification u/s.5 of the Act would not constitute a valid wakf in respect of the suit land – Therefore, the notification dtd. 29.04.1959 is not a conclusive proof B of the fact that the suit land is a wakf property. Wakf Act, 1954 – Notification published in the official Gazette – State Government, if bound by it – Held: No – Wakf Board is a statutory authority under the Wakf Act – Therefore, the official Gazette is bound to carry any notification at the instance of the C Wakf Board but, the State Government is not bound by such a publication of the notification published in the official Gazette merely for the reason that it has been so published.
