1, not being the widow of the deceased as recognized in law, is not entitled to any relief. As for the appellant No. 2 and 3, off spring of Late Subedar Bhave and the appellant 1, it is submitted that they too would not be entitled to any relief under the Regulations, in as much as, both the said appellants have crossed the age of 25 years whereas under Regulation 219(iv), the son of an employee would be eligible for family pension if he is below the age of 25 years. Lastly, it was submitted that the deceased had informed the respondents about contracting a marriage with the appellant No. 1 only in the year 1990. He had suppressed 20 (2013) 15 SCC 755 21 (2015) 12 SCC 301 22 2022 SCC OnLine SC 737 23 For short “ASG” 136 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. the said fact till he was discharged from service in 1984. Had this fact been brought to the notice of the authorities, appropriate action would have been taken against the deceased for misconduct. 8. We have heard the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties, perused the records and the impugned . The limited issue that requires to be answered is whether the appellants would be entitled to claim pensionary benefi ts of Late. Subedar Bhave in the facts of the instant case where he had got married to the appellant No.1 during the subsistence of his marriage with Anusuya, but, subsequently a decree of divorce was passed, dissolving the said marriage. 9. As has been noticed above, the fi rst wife of Subedar Bhave had passed away in the year 197524. On 17th March, 1975, he had got married to Anusuya. It appears that there was no issue from the said marriage. The deceased contracted a marriage with the appellant No. 1 herein during the subsistence of his marriage with Anusuya25.Three years down the line, he was discharged from service and granted service pension. The divorce by mutual consent between the deceased and Anusuya materialized only in November, 1990. The said decree of divorce is not in question. It is also not in dispute that the deceased had approached the respondents for seeking deletion of the name of Anusuya and for endorsing the name of the appellant No. 1 in his Service Book. Pertinently, the respondent No. 2 did include the name of the appellant No. 1 in the Service Book of the deceased, as his wife which is apparent from the document26 fi led by the respondents along with their counter affi davit.
