Insofar as the s of this Court on which respondent Nos. 5 and 6 have relied upon, we can only say that there cannot be any straight-jacket formula in the matters of custody. 15. Recently, this Court, in the case of Nirmala (supra) in paragraph 16 has also observed that no hard and fast rule can be laid down insofar as the maintainability of the habeas corpus petition in the matters of custody of minor child is concerned. It has been held that as to whether the writ court should exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or not will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. 16. However, it is to be noted that a common thread in all the s concerning the custody of minor children is the paramount welfare of the child. As discussed hereinabove, we find that, apart from the appellant being the natural guardian, even in to ensure the welfare of the minor child, she should live with her natural family. The minor child is of tender age, and she will get adapted to her natural family very well in a short period. We are therefore inclined to allow the appeal. 17. In the result, we pass the following : (i) The appeal is allowed; (ii) The impugned and of the High Court is quashed and set aside; (iii) Respondent Nos. 5 and 6 are directed to handover the custody of the minor child Sugandha Das forthwith; and (iv) We, however, permit respondent Nos. 5 and 6 to meet the minor child Sugandha Das at the residence of the appellant every Wednesday between 04:00 pm and 06:00 pm. 18. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
