8. Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee, Additional Solicitor General (ASG), appearing on behalf of the Respondent-state, argued that the impugned had taken a holistic view of the matter, and rightfully reduced the interest from 18% compound interest to 9% simple interest, in addition to disallowing Claim No. 6 of ` 3,00,000 awarded by the arbitrator for non-issuance of tender. The High Court, it was urged, had considered all the aspects of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before deciding to reduce the interest to a more reasonable rate. 9. It was asserted that even the counsel for the appellants at the time, before the High Court, had agreed that the statutory rate of interest should be 1 or 2% higher or lower than the bank rate, which in the last decade has been about 7-8%. As a result, 18% compound rate of interest was completely unjustifi ed, and warranted revision. 10. The ASG relied on several s of this court: Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Anr v. Pratibha Industries Ltd. & Ors.8 to stress on the scope of the inherent powers of the High Court as a constitutional court; Oriental Structural Engineers Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Kerala9 wherein the contract did not stipulate a rate of interest, and 18% awarded by the tribunal was held to be excessive and therefore, reduced to 8% simple interest by this court; and similarly Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh v. Kalsi Construction Company10 wherein this court reduced the rate of interest from 18% awarded 6 [2019] 11 SCR 640 7 [1991] Supp. 3 SCR 417 8 [2018] 14 SCR 1143 9 [2021] 4 SCR 137 10 (2019) 8 SCC 726 M/S LARSEN AIR CONDITIONING AND REFRIGRATION 91 COMPANY v. UNION OF INDIA [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] by the tribunal, to 9% simple interest, despite 18% having been the agreed upon rate of interest, given that the award was passed roughly 20 years prior. Analysis and conclusion 11. Section 31(7)(b) of the 1996 Act, was amended by Act 3 of 2016, w.e.f. 23.10.2015. The pre-amended provision, empowers the arbitrator to award both pre-award and post-award interest, and specifi es that the awarded sum would carry an interest of 18% per annum, unless provided otherwise, from the date of award till the date of payment. The pre-amended section, as it stood on the date of award by the arbitrator (21.01.1999), read as follows: “31. Form and contents of arbitral award […] (7) (a) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and in so far as an arbitral award is for the payment of money, the arbitral tribunal may include in the sum for which the award is made interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole or any part of the money, for the whole or any part of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made. (b) A sum directed to be paid by an arbitral award shall, unless the award otherwise directs, carry interest at the rate of eighteen per centum per annum from the date of the award to the date of payment.” (emphasis provided) 12.
