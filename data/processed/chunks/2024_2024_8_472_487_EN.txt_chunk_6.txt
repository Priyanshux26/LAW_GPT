Moreover, even though the Government, vide resolution dated 06.03.2017, has clarified that the Career Advancement Scheme is not related to promotion and therefore deleted the terms “promotions” occurring in resolutions dated 18.04.2016 and 03.08.2016, the High Court had proceeded on the footing that the grant of Senior Scale and Selection Grade under the Career Advancement Scheme can be said to be promotion to elucidate that such an argument would not help the case of the Petitioners. So, considering that the said resolutions of the Government are not under challenge in the instant case, we 7 [1997] Supp. 4 SCR 94 : (1997) 7 SCC 690 8 [1998] 3 SCR 1060 : (1998) 6 SCC 400 9 (1998) 5 SCC 268 10 (1997) 11 SCC 533 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 481 Maheshkumar Chandulal Patel & Anr. v. The State of Gujarat & Ors. will also deal with the relevant issue at hand presuming that even if the Career Advancement Scheme is considered to be promotion. 30. The short question that requires determination in the present case boils down to whether Rule 21 of the 2002 Pay Rules would be applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case or not. Rule 21 is quoted as under: “21. Stepping up of a pay of a Government employee on the basis of the pay of his junior: (1) Where on regulating initial pay of a Government employee under above rules-11, 13, 15 to 17 & 19 or on his appointment to a higher post if his pay is fixed at a lower rate of pay in that cadre than another Government employee junior to him in the lower grade but promoted or appointed subsequently in such another identical cadre; the pay of the senior Government employee on the higher post shall be stepped up to the figure equal to the pay as fixed for the junior Government employee in that higher post with effect from the date of promotion of the junior Government employee and it shall be subject to the following conditions viz:- i. both, the junior and the senior Government employees belong to one and the same cadre and the posts to which they have been promoted or appointed, shall be identical and in the same cadre and in the same line of promotion; ii. the time-scales of pay of the lower posts held by the senior and the junior Government employees shall be identical; iii. the time scales of the higher posts to which the Government employees are promoted or appointed shall be identical; iv. the senior Government employee had he not been appointed to the higher post earlier than his junior, he would have been eligible to draw pay at a stage not lower than that admissible to his junior in the lower post immediately prior to the appointment of the junior Government employee to the higher post; 482 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports v. the anomaly so caused must be the direct result of the application of this rule.
