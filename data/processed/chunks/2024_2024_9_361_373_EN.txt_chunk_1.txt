319 Cr.P.C. [Paras 24, 25, 27] Evidence Act, 1872 – Proviso to Section 132: Held: The proviso to Section 132 of the Act is based on the maxim nemo Tenetur prodere seipsum i.e. no one is bound to criminate himself and to place himself in peril – In this regard the law in England, (with certain exceptions) is that a witness need not answer any question, the tendency of which is to expose the witness, or to feed hand of the witness, to any criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture – The privilege is based on the principle of encouraging all persons to come forward with evidence, by protecting them, as far as possible, from injury or needless annoyance in consequence of so doing – This absolute privilege, in some cases tended to bring about a failure of justice, for the allowance of the excuse, particularly when the matter to which the question related was in the knowledge solely of the witness, deprived the court of the information which was essential to its arriving at a right decision – In to avoid this inconvenience, Section 132 of the Act, withdrew this absolute privilege and affords only a qualified privilege – The witness is deprived of the privilege of claiming excuse from testifying altogether; but, while subjecting him to compulsion, the legislature, in to remove any inducement to falsehood, declared that evidence so obtained should not be used against him, except for the purpose in the Act declared. [Paras 12, 13] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.132 – Whether the qualified privilege under the proviso to Section 132 of the Act, grants complete [2024] 9 S.C.R. 363 Raghuveer Sharan v. District Sahakari Krishi Gramin Vikas Bank & Anr. immunity to a person who has deposed as a witness (and made statements incriminating himself), notwithstanding the availability of other material with the prosecution: Held: The qualified privilege under the proviso to Section 132 of the Act, is intended to ensure that all the evidence is placed before the Court to reach a just conclusion – In view of this Court, it is not fathomable that a provision in the Evidence Act, the primary purpose of which was to ensure that all the material is before the Court and ensure that the ends of justice are met, could itself grant a blanket immunity to a witness (albeit complicit) – Such an interpretation would be unsustainable – Needless to say, that his statement cannot be used for any purpose whatsoever for the purposes of bringing such witness to trial – Thus, the qualified privilege under the proviso to Section 132 of the Act does not grant complete immunity from prosecution to a person who has deposed as a witness (and made statements incriminating himself). [Para 20] Evidence Act, 1872 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – What is the course available to a Court, which in the course of trial is confronted with evidence, other than the statement of the witness (against whom incriminating material is available); Whether the Court can rely upon the statement of the witness for invoking the provisions of Section 319 Cr.P.C.
