Submissions of the Writ Petitioners: G 23. Learned senior counsel and learned counsel appearing on behalf of the writ petitioners at the outset submitted that Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 is ultra vires the Constitution of India, insofar as it excludes from the definition of ‘Sikkimese,’ migrants/settlers of Indian origin who had settled in Sikkim much prior to the coming into effect the H 332 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 1961 Regulation, on the sole ground that such migrants/settlers had not been registered as ‘Sikkim Subjects’ under the 1961 Regulation. Further, the proviso to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 is unconstitutional and violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India because it excludes from the exempted category, a Sikkimese woman who married a non-Sikkimese after 1st April, 2008. B 24. As regards the first leg of challenge in the instant Writ Petitions, i.e., challenge to the vires of the definition of ‘Sikkimese’ under Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961, it was contended that old settlers/ migrants, who had settled in Sikkim much prior to the coming into effect of the 1961 Regulation had been excluded from the definition of C ‘Sikkimese’ and consequently rendered ineligible to claim the benefit of Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961, on the sole ground that their names could not be registered as Sikkim Subjects as their forefathers did not surrender their Indian citizenship. 25. It was further contended that migrants from other Countries/ D erstwhile Kingdoms such as Nepalese migrants, who had migrated to and settled in Sikkim at the same time or even after migrants/settlers of Indian origin, had been admitted to the benefits of Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T.
