As held by this Court, a fact is said to be “disproved” when, after considering the matters before it, the court either believes that it does not exist or considers its non-existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it does not exist. A fact is said to be “not proved” when it is neither “proved” nor “disproved” [See Vijayee Singh and Others v. State of U.P. (1990) 3 SCC 190]. 27. We are additionally satisfi ed that in the teeth of the fi nding of the appellate Judge, the disciplinary proceedings and the s passed thereon cannot be allowed to stand. The charges were not just similar but identical and the evidence, witnesses and circumstances were all the same. This is a case 820 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. where in exercise of our discretion, we quash the s of the disciplinary authority and the appellate authority as allowing them to stand will be unjust, unfair and oppressive. This case is very similar to the situation that arose in G.M. Tank (supra). 28. Apart from the above, one other aspect is to be noted. The Enquiry Offi cer’s report makes a reference to the appellant passing 10th standard, and to a 10th standard marksheet exhibited as Exh. P-4 referring to the date of birth as 24.07.1974. Jagdish Chandra-PW1 (in the departmental enquiry) clearly deposed that since the appellant was regularly absent from Class 10, his name was struck off and he did not even pass 10th standard. The appellant has also come out with this version before the disciplinary authority, stating that the 10th class certifi cate of Ram Lal produced before the Enquiry Offi cer, is of some other Ram Lal. 29. This issue need not detain us any further because it is not the case of department that the appellant sought employment based on 10th standard marksheet. It is their positive case that the appellant sought employment on the basis of his 8th standard marksheet. Shravan Lal-PW-4 in the departmental enquiry had also furnished the 10th standard marksheet procured from the Secondary Education Board, Ajmer. In cross-examination, on being asked, he admitted that the appellant was recruited on the basis of 8th standard marksheet, and he admitted that there was no alteration in the 8th standard marksheet. 30. In view of the above, we declare that the of termination dated 31.03.2004; the of the Appellate Authority dated 08.10.2004; the s dated 29.03.2008 and 25.06.2008 refusing to reconsider and review the penalty respectively, are all illegal and untenable. 31. Accordingly, we set aside the of the D.B. Special Appeal (Writ) No.484/2011 dated 05.09.2018. We direct that the appellant shall be reinstated with all consequential benefi ts including seniority, notional promotions, fi tment of salary and all other benefi ts. As far as backwages are concerned, we are inclined to award the appellant 50% of the backwages. The directions be complied with within a period of four weeks from today.
