for Democratic Reforms [(2002) 5 SCC 294] and People’s Union for Civil Liberties [(2003) 4 SCC 399] , we are of the considered view that Kuldip E Nayar [(2006) 7 SCC 1] does not overrule the other two decisions rather it only reaffirms what has already been said by the aforesaid two decisions. The said paragraphs recognise that right to vote is a statutory right and also in People’s Union for Civil Liberties [(2003) 4 SCC 399] it was held that “a fine distinction F was drawn between the right to vote and the freedom of voting as a species of freedom of expression”. Therefore, it cannot be said that Kuldip Nayar [(2006) 7 SCC 1] has observed anything to the contrary. In view of the whole debate of whether these two decisions were overruled or discarded because of the opening line in para 362 of Kuldip Nayar [(2006) 7 SCC 1] i.e. “We do G not agree with the above submissions” we are of the opinion that this line must be read as a whole and not in isolation. The contention of the petitioners in Kuldip Nayar [(2006) 7 SCC 1] was that majority view in People’s Union for Civil Liberties [(2003) 4 39(2013) 10 SCC 1 H ANOOP BARANWAL v. UNION OF INDIA 109 [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] SCC 399] held that right to vote is a constitutional right besides A that it is also a facet of the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. It is this contention on which the Constitution Bench did not agree too in the opening line in para 362 and thereafter went on to clarify that in fact in People’s Union for Civil Liberties [(2003) 4 SCC 399], a fine distinction was drawn B between the right to vote and the freedom of voting as a species of freedom of expression. Thus, there is no contradiction as to the fact that right to vote is neither a fundamental right nor a constitutional right but a pure and simple statutory right. The same has been settled in a catena of cases and it is clearly not an issue in dispute in the present case. With the above observation, we C hold that there is no doubt or confusion persisting in the Constitution Bench of this Court in Kuldip Nayar [(2006) 7 SCC 1] and the decisions in Assn. for Democratic Reforms [(2002) 5 SCC 294] and People’s Union for Civil Liberties [(2003) 4 SCC 399] do not stand impliedly overruled.” D (Emphasis supplied) S. ARTICLE 326 DEMYSTIFIED 110. Article 326 reads as follows: “326. Elections to the House of the People and to the Legislative E Assemblies of States to be on the basis of adult suffrage.—The elections to the House of the People and to the Legislative Assembly of every State shall be on the basis of adult suffrage; that is to say, every person who is a citizen of India and who is not less than 2 [eighteen years] of age on such date as may be fixed in that behalf by or under any law made by the appropriate F Legislature and is not otherwise disqualified under this Constitution or any law made by the appropriate Legislature on the ground of non-residence, unsoundness of mind, crime or corrupt or illegal practice, shall be entitled to be registered as a voter at any such election.” G 111.
