The test (c) is not satisfied in this case. Therefore, it is impossible to conclude that there is a transfer of the right to use tank trucks in favour of IOCL. Essentially, it is a contract to provide the service of transporting the goods using tank trucks to IOCL. Therefore, even in this case, all the five tests laid down by Dr AR Laxmanan, J are not fulfilled. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 515 M/s. K.P. Mozika v. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. and Ors. 41. Now, at this stage, we may refer to Section 65(105)(zzzzj) of the Finance Act, which was brought into force with effect from 16th May 2008. Section 65(105)(zzzzj) reads thus: “Section 65. Definitions – .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. (1) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. (105) “Taxable service” means any service provided or to be provided – (a) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. (zzzzj) to any person, by any other person in relation to supply of tangible goods including machinery, equipment and appliances for use, without transferring right of possession and effective control of such machinery, equipment and appliances.” It provides that “taxable service” means any service provided to any person by any other person in relation to the supply of tangible goods, including machinery, equipment and appliances for use without transferring the right of possession and effective control of such machinery, equipment and appliances. 42. Essentially, the transfer of the right to use will involve not only possession, which may be granted at some stage (after execution of the contract), but also the control of the goods by the user. When the substantial control remains with the contractor and is not handed over to the user, there is no transfer of the right to use the vehicles, cranes, tankers, etc. Whenever there is no such control on the goods vested in the person to whom the supply is made, the transaction will be of rendering service within the meaning of Section 65(105) (zzzzj) of the Finance Act after the said provision came into force. CONCLUSION 43. To conclude, all the appeals preferred by the assessees will have to be allowed. 516 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 44. Accordingly, we allow all the appeals of the assessees by holding that the contracts are not covered by the relevant provisions of the Sales Tax Act and of the VAT Act, as the contracts do not provide for the transfer of the right to use the goods made available to the person who is allowed to use the same. Civil Appeal no.3580 of 2017 preferred by the Union of India is disposed of in view of the earlier findings with the liberty to the Union of India to initiate proceedings, if any, for recovery of service tax in accordance with law.
