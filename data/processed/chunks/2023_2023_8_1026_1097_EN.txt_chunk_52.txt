But both the C above contentions are without substance. Rule 231 primarily deals with the grant of certified copies of certain other documents to the accused, before filing of the Final Report. Rule 231(3) states that certified copies of unmarked documents shall not be given. The High Court has not passed any directing the grant of certified copies of unmarked D documents. All that the High Court has done is permitting the ED to have an inspection of the documents under Rule 237 and thereafter to file a proper copy application. This is not contrary to Rule 231(3). 123. We do not know how an argument revolving around Section 65B of the Evidence Act is raised. Section 65B concerns the admissibility E of electronic records. Without certification, ED may not be able to use those electronic records in evidence, in the prosecution under PMLA. But it does not mean that they cannot even have a look at the electronic record. 124. Therefore, we find no merits in the appeal. Hence, the appeal challenging the of the High Court dated 30.03.2022 passed in F Criminal O.P. No.5726 of 2022 is dismissed. PART – IV (Extension of time to complete further investigation) 125. There is one appeal filed by Y. Balaji, whose status is indicated G by us in a tabular column elsewhere. His appeal challenges an passed by the High Court originally on 27.11.2019 directing the prosecution to complete further investigation in CC No.3627 of 2017 within six months. When a petition for extension of time was moved, the Court rejected it by an dated 01.11.2021 on the ground that the prayer H 35 For short “the Evidence Act” Y. BALAJI v. KARTHIK DESARI & ANR. ETC. 1095 [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] had become infructuous. Therefore, worried about the fate of further A investigation, the victim has come up with the above appeal. But the worry of the appellant is baseless. Merely because the High Court has not granted extension of time, it does not mean that the direction to conduct further investigation has become infructuous. On the contrary, a Final Report has already been filed under Section 173(8) of the Code B on 08.03.2021 in CC No.3627 of 2017 and the same has now become CC No.24 of 2021. 126. Therefore, the appeal challenging the s dated 27.11.2019 and 01.11.2021 is dismissed. Contempt Petitions C 127. Anti Corruption Movement has come up with petitions seeking the initiation of contempt proceedings against the Police Officials who are in-charge of the investigation, on the ground (i) that the offences under the PC Act have not been included in CC No.25 of 2021; (ii) that steps were not taken to have the interim stay vacated in two criminal D cases; and (iii) that a misleading picture was projected before the High Court as though the investigation was incomplete. 128. Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for the State and Shri Tiwari, learned AAG for the State submitted that there was no willful disobedience of the s passed by this Court and that E the State actually took steps to vacate the stay.
