Even if the property in question escapes the guillotine under the Jagir Abolition Regulations, it may meet its fate under the 1955 Act. Therefore, B the Single Judge as well as the Division Bench were right in holding that the properties were not established to be Mathruka properties. The effect of the of the Nazim Atiyat was not examined by the Trial Judge. In any case, such an examination had to be done independently and not in a partition suit, keeping C in view, the 1955 Act and various subsequent enactments relating to agricultural land reforms and urban land ceiling. [Paras 159 & 160][355-B-E] 5. When the entire claim of the appellants that the properties were Mathruka properties inheritable by the legal heirs D had failed, the question of executing a decree on the strength of the plea that the property is a Mathruka property does not arise.
