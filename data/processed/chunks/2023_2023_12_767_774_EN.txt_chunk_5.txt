The Empress Mills, Nagpur v. The Municipal Committee, Wardha1, (particularly paragraph 33). Since he fairly concedes that the issue which was sought to be raised has been concluded in the above decision of the Constitution Bench, no further submissions have been urged in that regard. 18. For the above reasons, we are of the view that only two issues which have been raised in the course of the present appeals are lacking in substance. 19. The appeals shall accordingly stand dismissed. 20. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals dismissed. Nidhi Jain 1 1958 SCR 1102
