Consequently, he fi led his petition before the Rajasthan High Court, inter alia, praying that the advertisement dated 11.01.2021 be quashed, as it was in violation of the notifi cation dated 28.06.2018 issued by the NCTE. 4. Apart from the above batch of petitioners, there was another set of petitioners, with their own grievance. These are the candidates who are diploma holders in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed. )1, which was the only teaching qualifi cation required for teachers at primary level, and who are aggrieved by the inclusion of B.Ed. qualifi ed candidates. They too fi led Writ Petitions before the Rajasthan High Court challenging the legality of the notifi cation dated 28.06.2018. The State of Rajasthan understandably supported these second batch of candidates before the High Court, as they would do before this Court. 5. Out of the three writ petitions before us two (W.P. No. 137 of 2022 and 881 of 2022) are challenging the notification dated 28.06.2018 and the subsequent notifications issued by the Government of Bihar and U.P. respectively calling for application from eligible candidates including B.Ed. W.P. No. 355 of 2022 again challenges the notification dated 28.06.2018. SLP (C) No. 22923 of 2022 is against an interim 1 It is possible that this diploma is called by diff erent names in diff erent States. It is for this reason that at some place it may just be referred as a diploma in elementary education. 172 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. of the Calcutta High Court which denied relief to the petitioners who were seeking a stay of the notifi cation dated 28.06.2018. 6. Hence the question of law to be answered in these cases is whether NCTE was right in including B.Ed. qualifi cation as an equivalent and essential qualifi cation for appointment to the post of primary school teacher (Level-1)? The Rajasthan High Court in the impugned has quashed the notifi cation dated 28.06.2018, holding B.Ed. candidates to be unqualifi ed for the posts of primary school teachers (Level-1). 7. On behalf of the Petitioners, we have heard learned Senior Counsel, Mr. Paramjit Singh Patwalia who has assailed the Judgement of the Rajasthan High Court. Mr. Patwalia appeared for the B.Ed. qualifi ed candidates and would support the notifi cation dated 28.06.2018, and the petitioners who had challenged their exclusion before the Rajasthan High Court. Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned senior counsel was also heard for the appellants. The learned counsel would argue that the High Court failed to consider that the notifi cation dated 28.06.2018 was a policy decision taken by the NCTE after the Central Government had issued directions in this regard, under Section 29 of the NCTE Act, and the High Court was wrong in interfering with the policy decision of the Central Government. The NCTE broadly agrees with the submissions which have been made by Shri Patwalia, and Ms. Arora, while assailing the impugned judgement. 8. We have also heard the submissions by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Kapil Sibal and Dr. Manish Singhvi who appeared for the Diploma holders and the State of Rajasthan respectively who would argue, inter alia, that the NCTE being an expert body had to take an independent decision in this case, based on the objective realties.
