The applicant’s claim of juvenility is primarily based on a “certificate” of date of birth issued on 30th January 2019, in the name of Niranaram, son of Chetanram. The said certificate has been issued by G the Pradhanacharya (Headmaster), Rajakiya Adarsh Uccha Madhyamik Vidyalaya, Jalabsar, Shri Dungargarh. In the said document, it is recorded that Niranaram was born on 1st February 1982. In a “transfer certificate” by the same authority issued on 15th August 2001, it is reflected that he had joined the school in Class First on 1st April 1986 vide admission H number 568 and left from Class Third (Passed) on 15th May 1989. NARAYAN CHETANRAM CHAUDHARY v. THE STATE OF 1067 MAHARASHTRA [ANIRUDDHA BOSE, J.] By the date of birth reflected in these certificates, the age of the A applicant on the date of commission of offence would have been 12 years and 6 months. The applicant, as we have already indicated, was tried as Narayan, not Niranaram. Moreover, in certain other documents Niranaram’s age is shown to be different from that reflected in the said certificates. The variations or discrepancies as regards the name of B applicant and his age are the factors we shall be dealing with in this and we shall dwell into these aspects in subsequent paragraphs of this . 3. In the chargesheet, the accused Narayan’s age was shown to be 20 years. We find from the of the High Court that the said C age (20-22 years) was given on behalf of the applicant only at the time of hearing. The High Court had tangentially referred to the question of age of the applicant in its in the appeal and death reference. At that time, however, the plea of juvenility was not there. It was observed in the High Court’s that the age of the accused at the time of occurrence ought to be borne in mind while considering the question of D awarding the sentence. 4.The applicant for the first time wanted a medical examination for determination of his age on 14th August 2005, when the Prison Inspector General, Western Division, Pune went to meet the applicant at Yerawada Central Prison. A request was made thereafter by the prison E authorities to the Chief Medical Officer and the applicant was taken to Department of Forensic Science, BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, Pune. The age determination report by the Department of Forensic Medicine, of the said institution states that on 24th August 2005, age of the patient was more than 22 years but less than 40 years F including margin of error. The said report reads: - “MD/ AGE/ 198/ 2005 Department of Forensic Science B J Medical College and Sassoon G General Hospital, Pune Proforma for age examination 24/8/2005 Mr. Narayan Chetram Chaudhary H 1068 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R.
