13. While considering as to whether the death penalty needs to be confirmed or not, we would be required to take into consideration various factors. 14. It is not in dispute that the appellant lost his mother at the tender age of 8 years and his elder brother at the age of 10 years. The appellant was brought up by his father as a single parent. The appellant has close family ties with his father, his sister, who is married and his grand-mother. Though, Shri Singh is right that the age of the appellant at the time of commission of crime solely cannot be taken into consideration, however the age of the appellant/accused at the time of commission of crime along with other factors can certainly be taken into consideration as to whether the death penalty needs to be commuted or not. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 43 Rabbu @ Sarvesh v. The State of Madhya Pradesh 15. In the present case, it is to be noted that the appellant comes from a socio-economic backward stratum of the society. As already discussed hereinabove, he lost his mother and brother at the tender age. The appellant and his family members do not have any criminal background. The appellant was of a tender age of 22 years when the aforesaid incident occurred. 16. It cannot be said that the appellant is a hardened criminal, who cannot be reformed. The possibility of the appellant, if given the chance of being reformed, cannot be ruled out. 17. In that view of the matter, we find that in the present case the confirmation of death penalty would not be justified. However, at the same time we also find that the ordinary sentence of life i.e. 14 years imprisonment with remission would not meet the ends of justice. In our considered view, the present case would fall in the middle path, as laid down by this Court in a catena of s, which are as follows:- i. Swamy Shraddananda (2) alias Murali Manohar Mishra v. State of Karnataka; 4 ii. Shankar Kisanrao Khade v. State of Maharasthra; 5 iii. Gandi Doddabasappa alias Gandhi Basavaraj v. State of Karnataka; 6 iv. Prakash Dhawal Khairnar (Patil) v. State of Maharashtra; 7 v. Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab; 8 vi. Madan v. State of Uttar Pradesh; 9 vii. Navas @ Mulanavas v. State of Kerala10 18. We, therefore, find that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the death penalty needs to be commuted to fixed imprisonment without remission for a period of 20 years. 4 [2008] 11 SCR 93 : (2008) 13 SCC 767 : 2008 INSC 853 5 [2013] 6 SCR 949 : (2013) 5 SCC 546 : 2013 INSC 281 6 [2017] 2 SCR 62 : (2017) 5 SCC 415 7 [2001] Supp. 5 SCR 612 : (2002) 2 SCC 35 : 2001 INSC 606 8 [2013] 3 SCR 90 : (2013) 3 SCC 294 : 2013 INSC 61 9 [2023] 16 SCR 765 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1473 10 [2024] 3 SCR 913 : 2024 SCC OnLine SC 315 : 2024 INSC 215 44 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
