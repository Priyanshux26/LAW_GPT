1509 Gaurav Kumar v. Union of India and Ors. which submitted its recommendations in 1960. The Joint Committee recommended renaming the proposed enactment as the Advocates Act because there would only be one class of legal practitioners in India, that is, advocates. Importantly, the Joint Committee recommended reducing the proposed enrolment fee from Rupees five hundred to Rupees two-hundred and fifty. The aim behind reducing the enrollment fee was “to bring in as many eligible lawyers within its [the legislation’s] fold as possible.”19 19. The recommendation of the Joint Committee was accepted by Parliament and incorporated under Section 24(1)(f). During the Parliamentary debates preceding the passage of the Advocates Act, many members suggested that the enrolment fee of Rupees two- hundred fifty was exorbitant.20 It was suggested that the enrolment fee should be further reduced or abolished altogether.21 The then Minister of Law (Mr A K Sen) justified the rationale for prescribing Rupees two hundred fifty as enrolment fee thus: “So far the Bar Council is concerned, a fee of Rs. 250 is not very unreasonable especially having regard to the fact that when we are setting up an autonomous body, we must give it enough funds to make it effective and useful. If it is to discharge all the functions given to it under this statute, then it requires funds and therefore Rs. 250 per entrant is not too much of a fee to pay when the Bar Council is going to function in so many different ways.”22 (emphasis added) The statement of the Law Minister indicates that the enrolment fee was meant to allow the SBCs to effectively discharge “all functions” under the Advocates Act. 19 The Legal Practitioners Bill 1959, Report of the Joint Committee (28 March 1960) xiii. (Raghubir Sahai and Khuswant Rai, the members of the Joint Committee noted: “The Constitution of an All India Bar was demand of the country since long and this Bill has been brought forward to meet it. Its aim would be to bring in as many eligible lawyers within its fold as possible. That is why the enrolment fee has been reduced from Rs. 500/- originally proposed in the Bill to Rs. 250/-. It would have been much better if this could be reduced to Rs. 125/- as suggested by the Law Commission and the stamp duty would have been done away with altogether.”) 20 Shri Shankaraiya, Legal Practitioners Bill, Lok Sabha (27 April 1961) 14162 21 Legal Practitioners Bill, Lok Sabha (27 April 1961) 14164 22 Rajya Sabha, Advocates Bill 1961 (4 May 1961) 2125. 1510 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 20. In 1973, the enrolment fee payable by the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was reduced to Rupees one hundred twenty-five. Subsequently, Section 24(1)(f) was amended in 1993 to revise the fees payable by general candidates from Rupees two hundred fifty to Rupees seven hundred fifty, without increasing the fees payable by candidates belonging to the SC and ST category. The enrolment fees were increased given the representations made by the Bar Councils.23 This indicates that Parliament is aware and responsive to the financial problems faced by the Bar Councils.24 ii.
