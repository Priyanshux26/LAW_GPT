However, in the aforesaid context, it is also necessary for us to look into the office report dated 03.07.2023, which reads thus: “It is further submitted that Dr. S.K. Verma, Advocate for respondent no.1 has on 28.06.2023 filed an application for release of deposited amount made by the Petitioner. However, C the same is defective as original property papers are not filed. Also, the documents relating to valuation of property are not filed as in the lease papers the amount mentioned is Rs. 6,30,000/-. Hence, the amount was not disbursed to the respondent no.1.” 41. It appears from the aforesaid that the complainant was not in D a position to withdraw the fifty per cent amount deposited by the petitioner herein. It further appears that the amount deposited by the petitioner herein is still with the Registry of this Court. Since we are not entertaining this petition on merits, we direct the Registry to refund the amount to the petitioner after due and proper verification. E 42. In the result, this petition is disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to approach the jurisdictional High Court and challenge the passed by the NCDRC, in accordance with law. 43. It is needless to clarify that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. The merits of the case shall be looked into by F the jurisdictional High Court.
