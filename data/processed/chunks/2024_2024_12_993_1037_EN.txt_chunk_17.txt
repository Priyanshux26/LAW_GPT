Supreme Court Reports • The compensation was supposed to be paid in terms of Section 60A(3) of the RUI Act, as amended. The State Government and the appellant neither determined the amount of compensation in terms of Section 52(7) of the RUI Act nor did they pass an award in terms of Section 60A(3). Further, the deposit of 80% of the estimated amount of compensation was supposed to be within a period of six months as per Section 60A(4), however, deposition of compensation in the reference court was done on 05.11.2009 after the acquisition notification stood quashed by the impugned . • Further, the Additional District Collector vide dated 03.12.1985 held that the respondents were not competent to receive compensation as the transfer of land in their favour was void ab initio. Even after the setting aside of the Additional Collector’s , no steps were taken by the Government to decide the compensation until after the acquisition proceedings itself were quashed by the High Court vide the impugned . • The respondents submitted that the Government’s letter dated 17.01.1988 to the appellant Trust highlighted that the provisions of Section 60A(4) mandatorily required the payment of 80% amount latest by 31.01.1988 that is, within 6 months from 01.08.1987 (the commencement date of the Amending Act, 1987). The letter further mentioned that in the event the appellant Trust did not submit the compensation amount by way of a cheque to the District Magistrate’s office latest by 21.01.1988, the same would be construed to be that the appellant Trust was no longer interested in the acquisition of the said land. This was never complied by the appellant as is evident from the belated deposit of the compensation amount in the reference court after the impugned was passed by the High Court. d) Since the respondents did not hear anything about the status of the acquisition proceedings for almost 17 years, they were of the view that the Government was not pursuing the acquisition proceedings. However, in 1997, the respondents were suddenly [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1019 Urban Improvement Trust v. Smt. Vidhya Devi and Ors. put to notice regarding the deposit of compensation in the reference court. Thereafter, the respondents filed writ petitions before the High Court for Nangli Kota and Moongaska lands. e) In response to the appellant’s contention that Section 60A(4) barred the respondents from challenging the acquisition proceedings on the ground of non-payment of compensation, the learned counsel for the respondents referred to this Court’s decision in Delhi Airtech Services (P) Ltd. v. State of U.P. reported in 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1408 wherein it was held that “…even if possession is taken, such possession cannot be considered as legal so as to vest the land absolutely if the prerequisite condition for payment of 80% before taking possession is not complied. In such circumstance, by legal fiction it looses its character as an acquisition under Section 17 and since the absolute vesting does not take place, it will lapse if the further process is not complied and the award is not passed within two years from the date of declaration…” Therefore, even though Section 11A is applicable to the cases of acquisition initiated under Section 17(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the consequence of it will not affect the case where the land has absolutely vested on compliance of subsection (3A) to Section 17 of the Act, 1894 and 80% of estimated compensation is tendered and paid.
