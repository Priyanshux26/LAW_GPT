C 9.1 The submission on behalf of the appellant, as above, cannot be accepted for the simple reason that this Court in the case of BCCI (supra) was considering the court proceedings under sections 34 and 36. To that, this Court interpreted section 26 in paragraphs 37 to 39, reproduced hereinabove, and held that the Amendment Act is prospective D in nature, and will apply to those arbitral proceedings that are commenced as understood by section 21 of the principal Act, on or after the Amendment Act, 2015 and to court proceedings which have commenced on or after the Amendment Act, 2015 came into force. Therefore, any observations made by this Court in paragraphs 37 to 39 in the case of BCCI (supra) shall be understood and construed with respect to court E proceedings which have commenced on or after the Amendment Act coming into force, namely, the proceedings under sections 34 & 36. Therefore, the decisions of this Court in the cases of Parmar Constructions Company (supra) and Pardeep Vinod Construction Company (supra) cannot be said to be per incuriam and/or in conflict F with the decision of this Court in the case of BCCI (supra). As observed hereinabove, in the case of Parmar Constructions Company (supra) which is directly on the point, it is specifically observed and held that the 2015 Amendment Act, which came into force w.e.f. 23.10.2015 shall not apply to the arbitral proceedings which are commenced in accordance with the provisions of section 21 of the principal Act, 1996 before the G coming into force the 2015 Amendment Act, unless parties otherwise agree (para 27). Similar view has been expressed in the case of S.P. Singla Constructions Private Limited (supra). 10. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the cases of Parmar Constructions Company (supra) and Pardeep Vinod H M/S. SHREE VISHNU CONSTRUCTIONS v. THE ENGINEER IN 353 CHIEF MILITARY ENGINEERING SERVICE [M. R. SHAH, J.] Construction Company (supra) and S.P. Singla Constructions Private A Limited (supra) to the facts of the case on hand as in the present case the notice invoking arbitration clause was issued on 26.12.2013, i.e., much prior to the Amendment Act, 2015 and the application under Section 11(6) of the Act has been preferred/filed on 27.04.2016, i.e., much after the amendment Act came into force, the law prevailing prior to the B Amendment Act, 2015 shall be applicable and therefore the High Court has rightly entered into the question of accord and satisfaction and has rightly dismissed the application under section 11(6) of the Act applying the principal Act, namely, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, prevailing prior to the Amendment Act, 2015. We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court. It is observed and C held that in a case where the notice invoking arbitration is issued prior to the Amendment Act, 2015 and the application under Section 11 for appointment of an arbitrator is made post Amendment Act, 2015, the provisions of pre-Amendment Act, 2015 shall be applicable and not the Amendment Act, 2015.
