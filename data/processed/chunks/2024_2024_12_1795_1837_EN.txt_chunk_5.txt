Against the dated 2nd 6 Writ-A no. 7114 of 2022 7 Special Appeal (D) No. 187 of 2022 8 W.P. 16585 of 2022 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1803 Allahabad University Etc. v. Geetanjali Tiwari (Pandey) & Ors. Etc. Etc. August 2023, Respondent 1 preferred Civil Misc Review Application.9 iii. Insofar as the advertisement dated 28th November 2022 is concerned, Respondent 1 filed another petition10 challenging the vires of Reg.10(f)(iii) of the 2018 Regulations. iv. Relying upon the dated 20th May 2022 (rendered in Writ-A No.7114 of 2022), the Single Judge dismissed the petition11 of the said Brahma Deo. Aggrieved by such dismissal, Brahma Deo also filed a Special Appeal (Defective).12 v. As noted above, vide the impugned , all the abovementioned four proceedings were disposed of. Impugned 3. The High Court noted the question arising for decision in paragraph 17 of its decision and commenced its discussion from paragraph 23. We consider it appropriate to reproduce verbatim the same hereunder: “17. The short question raised in this bunch of petitions is as to whether regulation 10(f)(iii) would be applicable while awarding marks for the teaching/post-doctoral experience, in terms of clause 7 of table 3A for shortlisting of candidates, to be called for interview for the post of Assistant Professors in universities? As a sequel, it has to be seen as to whether regulation 10(f)(iii) is ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India. *** 23. The counting of past services under regulation 10, however, would be relevant and directly co-related to the post on which direct appointment orpromotion under CAS itself is sought. Since, past services are required 9 Civil Misc. Application No. 398 of 2023 10 W.P. No. 580 of 2023 11 Writ-A No. 6927 of 2022 12 Special Appeal (D) no.257 of 2022 1804 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports for appointment to the post of Associate Professor and Professor only in the regulations, the relevance of regulation 10 would be restricted to these posts alone. 24. No previous teaching experience (including Assistant Professor) since is required as eligibility condition for appointment to the post of Assistant Professor, as such regulation 10 would have no direct applicability/relevance for appointment to the post of Assistant Professor. *** 29. Regulation 10 specifically deals with a defined exigency i.e. counting of past services for direct recruitment and promotion under CAS. This exigency is not attracted in the present set of cases. Regulation 10 has a direct nexus with the object sought to be achieved i.e. direct recruitment and promotion under CAS. Since past services are mandatorily required for appointment to the post of Associate Professor and Professor only, therefore, regulation 10 would have relevance only for appointment and promotion to such posts. 30. Reference of past services on the post of Assistant Professor for appointment to the post of Assistant Professor appears to be a surplusage since the eligibility for the post of Assistant Professor does not require any teaching experience. Counting of past services as Assistant Professor for appointment to the post of Assistant Professor serves no purpose in the scheme contained in the regulations.
