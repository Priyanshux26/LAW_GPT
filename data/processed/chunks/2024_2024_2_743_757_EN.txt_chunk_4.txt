Reliance was placed upon Section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (for short, ‘the GC Act’). Learned counsel for the State also relied upon another decision of this Court in the case of State of M.P. v. Kedia Leather & Liquor Ltd. and Ors.4 He submitted that the area of operation of the IPC and a food-related law like the FSSA are entirely different and, therefore, the same are mutually exclusive. The learned counsel urged that Section 89 gives overriding effect to the provisions of the FSSA over all other food-related laws, as is evident from the title of the Section. He submitted that the IPC is not a food-related law by any stretch of the imagination. Therefore, wherever Sections 272 and 273 of the IPC are attracted even after coming into force of the FSSA, the offender can be prosecuted under the said IPC provisions. 7. The learned counsel appearing for the accused invited our attention to the objects and reasons of the FSSA and its preamble. Their submission is that the FSSA is very exhaustive legislation dealing with all aspects of food, including adulteration, unsafe food, etc. Their submission is that Section 89 will have an overriding effect over the provisions of the IPC. Our attention is also invited to Section 5 and Section 41 of the IPC. The submission is that in view of Section 5, any special law will remain unaffected by the provisions of the IPC. Reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in the case of Jeewan Kumar Raut & Anr. v. Central Bureau of Investigation.5 The counsel for the accused also placed reliance on the decision of this Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh v. Aman Mittal and Anr6, in support of the proposition that the FSSA, being a special law, will exclude the applicability of the IPC for the fields which are covered by the provisions of the special Act. 4 [2003] Suppl. 2 SCR 727 : (2003) 7 SCC 389 5 [2009] 10 SCR 272 : (2009) 7 SCC 526 6 [2019] 11 SCR 1180 : (2019) 19 SCC 740 750 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS 8. Different provisions of the FSSA were brought into force on different dates by notifications issued from time to time. The last of such notification is of 29th July 2010. All the provisions of the FSSA were in force as on 29th July 2010 except Section 22. The offences subject matter of these appeals were registered after 29th July 2010. We have carefully considered the submissions made across the bar. The statement of objects and reasons of the FSSA mentions explicitly that the multiplicity of food laws creates confusion. The multiplicity of laws, standard setting and various implementing/enforcement agencies are detrimental to the growth of the nascent food processing industry. It is further provided that the FSSA provides a single window to guide and regulate the persons engaged in manufacturing, marketing, processing, handling, transport, import and sale of goods.
