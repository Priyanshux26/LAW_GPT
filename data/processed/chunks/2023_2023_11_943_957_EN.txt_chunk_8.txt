55. In the above circumstance, keeping in view, the object with which the Act, 1955 was amended so as to provide the benefi t to Overseas Citizen of India and in that context when rights were given to the OCI cardholders through the notifi cations issued from time to time, based on which the OCI cardholders had adopted to the same and had done things so as to position themselves for the future, the right which had accrued in such process could not have been taken away in the present manner, which would act as a ‘retroactive’ notifi cation. Therefore, though the notifi cation ex-facie does not specify retrospective operation, since it retroactively destroys the rights which were available, it is to be ensured that such of those benefi ciaries of the right should not be aff ected by such notifi cation. Though the rule against retrospective construction is not applicable to statutes merely because a part of the requisite for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing, in the instant case the rights were conferred under the notifi cation and such rights are being aff ected by subsequent notifi cation, which is detrimental and the same should be avoided to that extent and be allowed to operate without such retroactivity. 56. We note that it is not retrospective inasmuch as it does not aff ect the OCI Cardholders who have participated in the selection process, have secured a seat and are either undergoing or completed the MBBS course or such other professional course. However, it will act as retroactive action to deny the right to persons who had such right which is not sustainable to that extent. The goal post is shifted when the game is about to be over. Hence we are of the view that the retroactive PALLAVI vs. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 955 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] operation resulting in retrospective consequences should be set aside and such adverse consequences is to be avoided. 57. Therefore in the factual background of the issue involved, to sum up, it will have to be held that though the impugned notifi cation dated 04.03.2021 is based on a policy and in the exercise of the statutory power of a Sovereign State, the provisions as contained therein shall apply prospectively only to persons who are born in a foreign country subsequent to 04.03.2021 i.e. the date of the notifi cation and who seek for a registration as OCI cardholder from that date since at that juncture the parents would have a choice to either seek for citizenship by descent or to continue as a foreigner in the background of the subsisting policy of the Sovereign State. 58. In light of the above, it is held that the respondent No. 1 in furtherance of the policy of the Sovereign State has the power to pass appropriate notifi cations as contemplated under Section 7B(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, to confer or alter the rights as provided for therein.
