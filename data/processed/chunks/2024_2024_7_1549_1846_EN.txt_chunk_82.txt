By making Entry 23 of List II subordinate to Entry 54 of List I, the Constitution tilts the balance of legislative powers with respect to the regulation of mines and mineral development in favor of the Union. 133. Before delving further into the inter-relationship between the two entries, we deem it necessary to define the subject matter of the entries. The subject-matter of the entries has to be understood from both the text and the context in which the words have been used. 134. The expression “regulation” generally means to manage the governance of an enterprise by means of rules or laws.182 In K Ramanathan v. State of Tamil Nadu,183 this Court explained the meaning of the power to regulate in the following terms: “19. It has often been said that the power to regulate does not necessarily include the power to prohibit, and ordinarily the word “regulate” is not synonymous with the word “prohibit”. This is true in a general sense and in the sense that mere regulation is not the same as absolute 182 Ramanatha Aiyar Advanced Law Lexicon (Volume 3) 4778. 183 [1985] 2 SCR 1028 : (1985) 2 SCC 116 [19] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1655 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. prohibition. At the same time, the power to regulate carries with it full power over the thing subject to regulation and in absence of restrictive words, the power must be regarded as plenary over the entire subject. It implies the power to rule, direct and control, and involves the adoption of a rule or guiding principle to be followed, or the making of a rule with respect to the subject to be regulated. The power to regulate implies the power to check and may imply the power to prohibit under certain circumstances, as where the best or only efficacious regulation consists of suppression. It would therefore appear that the word “regulation” cannot have any inflexible meaning as to exclude “prohibition”. It has different shades of meaning and must take its colour from the context in which it is used having regard to the purpose and object of the legislation, and the Court must necessarily keep in view the mischief which the legislature seeks to remedy.” 135. The word “regulate” is of wide import and the breadth of its meaning depends on the context in which it is used. This Court has construed the power to regulate to include the power to: (i) grant or revoke a permission or licence including incidental or supplemental powers;184 (ii) prohibit depending upon the context and circumstance;185 (iii) control or adjust by rule or to subject to governing principles;186 and (iv) issue directions.187 Thus, the expression “regulation” appearing in Entry 54 of List I and Entry 23 of List II must also receive a wide meaning, in keeping with the principle that the words used in the legislative entries must be interpreted broadly. 136. A “mine” is generally defined as an excavation in the earth for the purpose of obtaining minerals.188 The expression was defined under the Mines Act 1952 to primarily mean any excavation for the 184 State of Tamil Nadu v. Hindu Stone (1981) 2 SCC 205 [10]; State of Uttar Pradesh v. Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh (1989) 2 SCC 505 [52] 185 Talcher Municipality v. Talcher Regulated Market Committee (2004) 6 SCC 178 [14]; Union of India v. Asian Food Industries Ltd (2006) 13 SCC 542 [43] 186 UP Coop.
