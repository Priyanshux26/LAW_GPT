109 The Domestic Violence Act, 2005. 110 The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. 111 ‘POCSO Act’ 112 Statement of Objects and Reasons, POCSO. 1566 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The POCSO Act operates in a manner which promotes the best interest and well-being of a child and ensures their healthy physical, emotional, intellectual and social development.113 80. The POCSO Act applies to all children regardless of their gender. Section 2(d) defines a child as being under the age of eighteen. The Act elevates the age of consent to eighteen years for all persons. The 2013 amendment to the IPC increased the age of consent under the rape provision from sixteen to eighteen. However, the marital rape exception to the rape provision in Section 375 IPC continued to protect men for having sex with their minor wives. In Independent Thought (supra) this court removed the inconsistency and struck down the exception to the penal provision on rape under Section 375 IPC in so far as it related to minors. Further, Subclause (vi) of clause (d) of Section 63 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023114 prescribes the age of consent to be eighteen years. Section 63 BNS is pari materia to Section 375 IPC. 81. The principles of the POCSO Act are directly threatened by the commission of child marriage. The intent of the POCSO Act is to protect children from sexual advances. Child marriage on the other hand is an institution which puts minor girls directly in harm’s way. Under the POCSO Act, a man is liable to punishment for having sex with his minor wife. Nevertheless, the existence of child marriage and its continued recognition in the law as a valid (and voidable) marriage threatens the dignity of children. The institution of child marriage, more directly than any other institution, stipulates for the sexual abuse of child brides by design. C. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015 82. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act115 was first enacted in 2000 to provide for the protection of children. The legislation underwent amendments in 2006 and 2011. Thereafter, based on the recorded inadequacies of the legislation, Parliament enacted a new 113 Ibid. 114 ‘BNS’ 115 ‘JJ Act’ [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1567 Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. JJ Act in 2015. The JJ Act was enacted in furtherance of Article 15 and Articles 39(e) and (f),116 45117 and 47118 of the Constitution to ensure the proper care, protection, development, treatment and social re-integration of children in difficult circumstances. The JJ Act applied a child-friendly approach and is premised on the principle of the best interest of the child. 83. The JJ Act inter alia deals with children in need of care and protection.119 Section 2(14) defines CNCP. Sub-clause (xii) of Section 2(14) of the JJ Act prescribes that children at imminent risk of marriage are CNCP. The provision reads as follows: “2. Definitions.–In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,– … (14) “child in need of care and protection” means a child– … (xii) who is at imminent risk of marriage before attaining the age of marriage and whose parents, family members, guardians and any other persons are likely to be responsible for solemnisation of such marriage;” 116 “39.
