[2024] 12 S.C.R. 484 : 2024 INSC 949 Birma Devi & Ors. v. Subhash & Anr. (Special Leave Petition(Civil) No. 29397 of 2024) 06 December 2024 [J.B. Pardiwala and R. Mahadevan, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether the relief of possession may be granted by the executing court in a case where the suit has been decreed for specific performance simpliciter and no express relief for the transfer of possession of the suit property has been granted. Headnotes† Specific Relief Act, 1963 – s.22 – Executing court declined to handover the possession of the suit property to the respondents-plaintiffs (decree holders) holding that though there was a decree for specific performance no relief as regards putting the plaintiffs in possession of the suit property was granted – set aside by High Court – Challenged by subsequent purchasers: Held: In cases where the possession of the suit property is exclusively with the contracting party, then a decree for specific performance simpliciter, without specifically providing for delivery of possession, may give complete relief to the decree holder – However, in cases where the relief of possession cannot be effectively granted to the decree-holder without specifically claiming relief for possession, for example, in cases where the property agreed to be conveyed is jointly held by the defendant with other persons, or cases where after the contract the property has passed in possession of a third person, then the plaintiff, in to obtain complete and effective relief, must claim the relief of transfer of possession over the property – Section 22 allows the plaintiff to amend the plaint to include a claim for the relief of possession, partition, etc. at “any stage of the proceeding” including the stage of execution of the decree by the executing court – Special Leave Petition dismissed – Transfer of Property Act, 1882 – s.55.
