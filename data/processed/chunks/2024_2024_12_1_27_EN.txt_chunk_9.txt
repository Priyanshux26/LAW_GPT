v. Farzu.9 22. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the second respondent/ the complainant contended that the acceptance of the Final Report, based on the first complaint could not be a bar for maintaining a fresh complaint on the same set of facts. It is submitted that virtually upon filing of the Final Report based on the first complaint only an objection was filed by the second respondent and therefore, it ought not to have been taken as the first narazi complaint. At the same time, it is further contended that even if it is taken as the first narazi complaint, a second narazi complaint is not barred by law. To fortify the said contention, the learned counsel relied on the decision of this Court in Mahesh Chand v. B. Janaradhan Reddy & Anr.10 and Shivshankar Singh’s case (supra). 23. In view of the plethora of decisions, there can be no doubt that even when Final Report filed after investigation based on the FIR registered pursuant to the receipt of complaint forwarded by a Court for investigation under Section 156 (3) of the Cr.P.C., is accepted and protest petition thereto is rejected, the Magistrate can still take cognizance upon a second complaint or second protest petition, on the same or similar allegations or facts. But this position is subject to conditions. 24. In Samta Naidu & Anr. v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr.,11 this Court considered all the relevant decisions including Pramatha Nath Talukdar v. Saroj Ranjan Sarkar,12 Jatinder Singh v. Ranjit Kaur,13 Poonam Chand Jain v. Farzu,14 and Shivshankar Singh’s case 6 [2011] 13 SCR 247 : (2012) 1 SCC 130 7 [1981] 1 SCR 935 : AIR 1980 SC 1883 8 [1977] 1 SCR 125 : AIR 1977 SC 2432 9 [2010] 2 SCR 109 : (2010) 2 SCC 631 10 [2002] Supp. 4 SCR 566 : (2003) 1 SCC 734 11 [2020] 2 SCR 1127 : (2020) 5 SCC 378 12 [1962] Supp. 2 SCR 297 : AIR 1962 SC 876 13 [2001] 1 SCR 707 : (2001) 2 SCC 570 14 [2010] 2 SCR 109 : (2010) 2 SCC 631 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 15 Subrata Choudhury @ Santosh Choudhury & Ors. v. The State of Assam & Anr. (supra) in regard to the moot question involved, in paragraphs 12 to 12.3, 12.5, 13 and 16 thereunder. The said paragraphs, insofar as they are relevant to this case, are as under: 12. The law declared in Talukdar has consistently been followed, for instance, in Bindeshwari Prasad Singh v. Kali Singh it was observed: (Bindeshwari Prasad Singh case, SCC p. 59, para 4) “4. … it is now well settled that a second complaint can lie only on fresh facts or even on the previous facts only if a special case is made out.” (emphasis supplied) The view taken in Bindeshwari was followed in A.S. Gauraya v. S.N. Thakur. 12.1. In Jatinder Singh v. Ranjit Kaur the issue was whether the first complaint having been dismissed for default, could the second complaint be maintained.
