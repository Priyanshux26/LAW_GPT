It is a well-established principle of interpretation that the courts must give full effect to a legal fiction by having due regard to the purpose for which the legal fiction is created.157 The consequences that follow the creation of the legal fiction “have got to be worked out to their logical extent.”158 The court has to assume all the facts and consequences that are incidental or inevitable corollaries to giving effect to the fiction.159 99. In Ashish Agarwal (supra), this Court created a legal fiction by deeming the Section 148 notices issued under the old regime as show cause notices under Section 148A(b) of the new regime. The purpose of the legal fiction was to enable the Revenue “to proceed further with the reassessment proceedings as per the substituted provisions” of the Income Tax Act. Accordingly, all the reassessment notices issued under the old regime were deemed to always have been show cause notices issued under Section 148A(b) of the new regime. The fiction replaced Section 148 notices with Section 148A(b) notices with effect from the date when the notices under Section 148 of the old regime were issued between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021, as the case may be. This ensured the continuance of the reassessment process initiated by the Revenue from 1 April 2021 to 30 June 2021 under the old regime. 157 State of Maharashtra v. Laljit Rajshi Shah (2000) 2 SCC 699 [6]. 158 Bengal Immunity Company Ltd v. State of Bihar, 1955 SCC OnLine SC 2 159 Industrial Supplies (P) Ltd. v. Union of India (1980) 4 SCC 341 [25] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1701 Union of India & Ors. v. Rajeev Bansal 100. Importantly, this Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra) did not quash the reassessment notices issued under Section 148 of the old regime. In Shree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. v. Church of South India Trust Association,160 a three-Judge Bench of this Court explained the distinction between quashing an and staying the operation of an thus: “10. […] Quashing of an results in the restoration of the position as it stood on the date of the passing of the which has been quashed. The stay of operation of an does not, however, lead to such a result. It only means that the which has been stayed would not be operative from the date of the passing of the stay and it does not mean that the said has been wiped out from existence.” The reassessment proceedings erroneously initiated by the Revenue under the old regime were not wiped out from existence. Consequently, the Revenue was not required to start the procedure of reassessment afresh after the decision of this Court in Ashish Agarwal (supra). 101. Under Section 148A(b), the assessing officer has to comply with two requirements: (i) issuance of a show cause notice; and (ii) supply of all the relevant information which forms the basis of the show cause notice. The supply of the relevant material and information allows the assessee to respond to the show cause notice.
