Mehta v. Union of India, (1999) 6 SCC 237: AIR 1999 SC 2583; Mallikarjuna Mudhagal Nagappa v. State of Karnataka, (2000) 7 SCC 238: AIR 2000 SC 2976: 2000 AIR SCW 3289; and Chandra Singh v. State of Rajasthan, (2003) 6 SCC 545: AIR 2003 SC 2889: 2003 AIR SCW 3518 and Raj Kumar Soni v. State of U.P., (2007) 10 SCC 635. G. CONCLUSION 75. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the view that no interference is warranted with the impugned of the High Court. However, the facts and circumstances of this case have left us with an uphill task to mould the final necessary to be passed in to do substantial justice with the parties to this litigation. 76. Having taken the view that the High Court committed no error, much less any error of law, we could have dismissed both the appeals and closed this litigation. However, doing the same will put the appellant in immense difficulties. As noted in the earlier part of this , the appellant has set up an oxygen cylinder manufacturing plant on the suit property. It has invested a huge amount in setting up this plant and has been running this plant for almost 15 years. Approximately 200 employees are working in the said plant. If the possession of the suit property is taken over, then the plant will have to be dismantled unless in any fresh auction proceedings some person is interested in taking over the entire plant with the land. In such circumstances, we deem fit to give one opportunity to the appellant to save its industrial unit set up on the subject land. If the appellant wants to save the industrial unit and the land, it must deposit a sum of Rs. 4,00,00,000/- (Rupees Four Crore Only) with the respondent no. 6-ARCIL towards full and final settlement of all liabilities. No other lender or financial institution shall thereafter put forward any further [2024] 7 S.C.R. 531 M/s Al-Can Export Pvt. Ltd. v. Prestige H.M. Polycontainers Ltd. & Ors. claim, even if any. It is for the respondent no. 6-ARCIL to deal with such a situation. 77. In view of the aforesaid, both the appeals are allowed in part. While affirming the impugned and passed by the High Court, we direct the appellant to deposit a sum of Rs. 4,00,00,000/- (Rupees Four Crore Only) with the respondent no. 6-ARCIL within a period of six months from today, failing which we shall proceed to pass further s. 78. Let this matter be notified once again before this Bench to report whether the appellant has deposited the amount of Rs. 4,00,00,000/- (Rupees Four Crore Only) with ARCIL or not. We clarify that if the appellant fails to deposit the amount, we shall direct the competent authorities to take over the possession of the entire unit with the land in question and put the same once again for sale by way of fresh auction process. 79. We may further clarify that if the appellant deposits the requisite amount within the stipulated period, then the contempt proceedings pending before the High Court of Bombay shall also stand terminated.
