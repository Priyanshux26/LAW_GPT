311 New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v. M/s Tata Steel Ltd. and the cost of the new equipment. Instead, the Insured originally undertook that they will reinstate the damaged property; received the on account payment of Rs.4,92,80,905/- (i.e. Rs.05 Crores minus TDS) and informed NIACL that they have placed for repair of 20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill to M/s Flat Products and paid them Rs. 3.75 crores. Thereafter by their letter of 16.06.1999, the Insured sought assessment of net adjusted loss at Rs.20.95 Crores. After this, without showing any progress merely letters were written repeatedly asking for early settlement. The scenario was while the surveyors of NIACL kept asking for the basic and relevant particulars, the Insured without furnishing the same kept asking for the settlement of the money. 59. Fortunately for the Insured, NIACL did not completely repudiate the claim. Instead faced with the letters of the Insured dated 16.06.1999 admitting to the value at Rs.20.95 Crores and the letter of M/s Flat Products of 28.06.2001 throwing up their hands and informing the Insured about them having lost their expertise, NIACL resorted to settling the claim under the opening clause of the policy by agreeing to pay the Insured the value of the property at the time of the happening of the destruction. (Depreciation Method) 60. We are not in a position to fault NIACL for resorting to this method of settlement. b) Quantum of Base Figure: - 61. NIACL also applied depreciation at the rate of 60% on the figure of Rs.20.09 Crores. Whether this was a correct percentage of depreciation was really the only dispute that was adjudicated before the original forum. The Insured has a two-fold case to challenge the basis of settlement adopted by NIACL before this Court. First, they contend that the base figure should have been Rs.28 Crores based on the figure they say M/s Flat Products was to charge them for reinstating the 20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill and after adding taxes to the figure of Rs. 25 crores, they arrive at a base figure of Rs. 28 crores. This contention is totally untenable for the following reasons. a. Firstly, by their letter of 16.06.1999, they categorically agree and confirm to the assessment of the net adjusted loss at Rs.20.95 Crores. b. Secondly, there was no proof forthcoming from the Insured. Since no invoices were furnished to state that the value of the 312 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports property on the date of the loss was Rs. 25 crores, the post incident certificates produced along with the letter of 09.12.1999 of M/s Mukand Limited and the letter of M/s Flat Products dated 09.12.1999 attempting to make a remote connection with the value of the damaged property do not inspire any confidence. In any event, they are not invoices depicting the value of the property at the time of its installation. c. In any event, the surveyors, based on their expertise, having assessed the value at Rs.20.09 Crores, there is no reason to countenance the submission that the base figure on which the depreciation should have been calculated was Rs.
