We may perhaps prescribe that at least 75 of the crop should comprise of forest species. iv) Crown density: It would not be meaningful to apply the Forest (Cons.) Act, 1980 to degraded and open areas under private ownership. Therefore, a minimum crown density of 40% may be adopted as a standard assessing the applicability of the Act in such private and revenue areas which are not recorded as ‘forests’ in the land records.” [Emphasis supplied] 5. By an dated 12.12.1996 in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India6, this Court explained that the word “forest” for the purpose of Section 2(i) of the FCA 1980 must be understood according to its dictionary meaning, and would cover “all statutorily recognised forests, whether designated as reserved, protected or otherwise”. This Court further explained that the term “forest land”, occurring in Section 2 would include not only “forest” as understood in the dictionary sense, but also “any area recorded as forest in the Government record irrespective of the ownership”. 6. Further, this Court vide dated 12.12.1996 in TN Godavarman Case (supra) directed all the States to constitute an expert committee for the following tasks: “(i) Identify areas which are “forests”, irrespective of whether they are so notified, recognised or classified under any law, and irrespective of the ownership of the land of such forest; (ii) identify areas which were earlier forests but stand degraded, denuded or cleared; and (iii) identify areas covered by plantation trees belonging to the Government and those belonging to private persons.” 7. The Government of Goa, to implement the said , constituted the Sawant Committee in 19977 which identified a total of 46.89 sq. kms as private forest. Thereafter the Karapurkar Committee 6 (1997) 2 SCC 267. 7 Under the Chairmanship of Shri SM Sawant on 24.01.1997. 710 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports was constituted in 20008 to identify the remaining areas. Since the Karapurkar Committee suggested a revisit to exclude some of the forest areas already identified by the Sawant Committee, the present appellant herein, Goa Foundation, filed Writ Petition (Civil) No.181 of 20019 before this court challenging the appointment of the Karapurkar Committee. Meanwhile, the Karapurkar Committee submitted its final report and identified 20.18 sq. kms of private forests. Both the Committees for identification of an area as private forest followed the same criteria as was formulated by the Forest Department of Goa in 1991. However, the task of both the Committees was incomplete as some areas were left unidentified. This Court vide dated 10.02.2006 disposed of the W.P. (C) No.181 of 2001 in following terms:- “……bulk of private forests in the State of Goa still remains to be identified and the same is being sacrificed in collusion with developers and vested interest persons and no action has been taken by the State Government to set up a fresh committee that will bring a finality to the dated 12.12.1996 passed in WP Civil No. 202/1995. In substance, the prayer in the application is for appointment of another committee or for consideration of the issue by the Central Empowered Committee to identify the private forests.
