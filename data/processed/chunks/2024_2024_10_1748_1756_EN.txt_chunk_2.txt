What is relevant for us is Clause 16 of the agreement, incorporating the arbitration clause. 5. Even before the expiry of the lease, the storage charges were said to have been revised on a pan India basis w.e.f. 01.11.2012. The revision of the storage charges was communicated to the respondent and by a letter dated 04.10.2012, a demand for enhanced payment w.e.f. 01.11.2012 was raised. The appellant renewed the said demand on 10.05.2013 and 31.12.2014 and intimated that if the amount is not paid, it will be inferred that the respondent is not interested in retaining the facility. While the matter was pending, the storage charges were further revised w.e.f. 01.04.2015 by a letter dated 05.03.2015 when the respondent was informed that the tariff will be at the rate of Rs.177/- per sq. mtr. per month. 6. In turn, the respondent is said to have intimated the appellant that it is interested in continuing the facility but sought renewal of the agreement dated 26.09.2012 by also committing that any arrears due as per the original agreement would be cleared. 7. On 16.09.2015, the appellant is supposed to have rejected the request for renewal of the agreement and has in turn raised a demand of Rs. 16,10,004/. In view of the fact that the respondent had not vacated the premises despite the lease’s expiry on 11.09.2015, the appellant invoked the provisions of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 (hereinafter the Public Premises Act). 1752 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 8. It is an admitted fact that even before the of the Estate Officer under the Public Premises Act could be passed, the respondent is said to have vacated the premises on 13.11.2015. The Estate Officer any way passed his on 31.12.2015 holding that the respondent was in unauthorised possession only from 11.09.2015 (i.e. when the lease expired) to 13.11.2015 (when premises were vacated) and also directed payment of certain dues as indicated in the demand notice. 9. It is in the above referred background that the respondent invoked arbitration by filing an application under Section 11(6) of the Act for the appointment of an arbitrator in view of a subsisting arbitration clause in the agreement. The said clause is as under: “16. All disputes and differences arising out of or in any way touching upon or concerning this agreement whatsoever shall be referred to the sole Arbitration of any person appointed by the Managing Director, Central Warehousing Corporation New Delhi. The Award of such Arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties to this agreement. It is a term of this agreement that in the event of such arbitrator to whom the matter is originally referred / being transferred or vacating his office or being unable to act for any reason the Central Warehousing Corporation at that time shall appoint any other person to act as Arbitrator in accordance with the terms of this agreement. Such person shall be entitled to proceed with the reference from the stage at which it was left by his predecessors.
