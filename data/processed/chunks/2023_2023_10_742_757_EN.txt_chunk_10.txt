What would be reasonable time, would depend upon the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of the default/ statute, prejudice caused, whether the third-party rights had been created, etc….” 35. In Mansaram v. S.P. Pathak and Ors.9 this Court has D observed that when a power exists to effectuate a purpose it must be exercised within a reasonable time. It has been observed that this is all too well-settled principle to require buttressing precedent. Nonetheless, the Court refers to State of Gujarat v. Patel Raghav Natha10 wherein the period of one year was found to be too long for the Commissioner to exercise revisional jurisdiction under Section 211 of the Bombay Land E Revenue Code. The principle of reasonable time as mentioned herein was followed recently by a Two-Judge Bench in Securities and Exchange Board of India v. Sunil Krishna Khaitan and Ors.11. 36. Keeping in view the above-stated well established principles that State action irrespective of being in the contractual realm must abide F by Article 14, and that a) after passage of a considerable period of time, in July, 2004 the reduction to 10000 KVA was agreed to and a new agreement to that effect was entered into; b) irrespective of the amount of reduction in KVA sought other applications were considered within a reasonable period of time; c) no reason has been put forth for keeping G such application pending; d) that the Appellant duly and repeatedly followed up with the authorities to effectuate such reduction; and e) the 8 (2019) 5 SCC 90 9 (1984) 1 SCC 125 10 (1969) 2 SCC 187 H 11 (2023) 2 SCC 643 THE MADRAS ALUMINIUM CO. LTD. v. THE TAMIL NADU 757 ELECTRICITY BOARD AND ANR. [SANJAY KAROL, J.] Appellant has been unjustifiably asked to furnish costs for unutilized A electricity which, in any case should not have extended beyond the period of six months (considering ‘reasonable period’ to consider an application, to be so), for a period much larger thereto, rendering such action unquestionably unreasonable and arbitrary. 37. In view of the factual narrative, it would not be open for the B Respondents to contend that the petitioner is not liable for the refund of the amount deposited under protest towards the bills so generated taking the maximum load to be 23000 KVA. Particularly, when at no point in time, the Appellant neither sought for nor consumed the electricity more than the maximum demand of 10000 KVA. C 38. Acknowledging the financial health of the Appellant, in the 1999 agreement4, the Respondent ought to have taken a decision on the Appellant request with a reasonable dispatch and terms which ought to have been withing a period latest by six months and not two and a half years as was so eventually done. D 39. For the aforesaid reasons, the appeals are allowed. dated 15th December 2008 in WA 3806-3807 & 3808 of 2003 passed by the High Court of Madras is set aside. 40. We direct the Respondent namely The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board to return the amount as may be calculated and verified, paid by E the Appellant to it for 13000 KVA, in excess to its request of maximum sanctioned demand of 10000 KVA (23000-10000 = 13000 KVA).
