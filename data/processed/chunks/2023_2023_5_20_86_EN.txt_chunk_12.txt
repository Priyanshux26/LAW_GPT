26. Mr. Basant in support of his aforesaid submission invited the attention of this Court to the decision of this Court in the case of Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma and Others reported in (2020) 9 SCC 1, more particularly, the observations in para 76 at page 58, which reads H thus: PRASANTA KUMAR SAHOO & ORS. v. CHARULATA SAHU 39 & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] “76. It was argued that in case Parliament intended that the A incident of birth prior to 2005 would be sufficient to confer the status of a coparcener, Parliament would need not have enacted the proviso to Section 6(1). When we read the provisions conjointly, when right is given to the daughter of a coparcener in the same manner as a son by birth, it became B necessary to save the dispositions or alienations, including any partition or testamentary succession, which had taken place before 20-12-2004. A daughter can assert the right on and from 9-9-2005, and the proviso saves from invalidation the above transactions.” (Emphasis supplied) C 27. Mr. Basant submitted that there was no good reason for the High Court to look into the validity and execution of the settlement deed between the Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 resply. If all the properties are considered to be ancestral, the Plaintiff is entitled to 1/6th share of the total ancestral properties, while the Defendant No. 1 would be entitled to 5/6th share of the total ancestral property. He submitted that in the D event, it is determined that the J series properties (1 to 8 properties) are in fact self-acquired, then the Plaintiff is entitled to 1/6th share of the ancestral property and 1/3rd share of the self-acquired property, while the Defendant No. 1 would be entitled to 5/6th share of the total ancestral property and 2/3rd share of the self-acquired property. E 28. In support of his submission that the settlement between Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 resply was lawful, just and proper, he relied on the following decisions of this Court: (i) Bai Chanchal and Others v. Syed Jalaluddin and Others reported in (1970) 3 SCC 124 at para 8, F (ii) Byram Pestonji Gariwala v. Union Bank of India and Others reported in (1992) 1 SCC 31 at para 38-41, (iii) D.S.

Rajinder Singh and Others reported in (2006) 5 SCC 566 at paras 18, 19, 23-25. H 40 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A 29.
