The accused is indeed entitled to have the benefit of one which is favourable to him.” 5 (1984) 4 SCC 116 6 (1973) 2 SCC 793 H 7 (2019) 19 SCC 447 SANTOSH @ BHURE v. STATE (G.N.C.T.) OF DELHI 741 [MANOJ MISRA, J.] 26. Bearing in mind the aforesaid legal principles, we would have A to examine — (i) whether the circumstances relied by the prosecution have been proved beyond reasonable doubt; (ii) whether those circumstances are of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused; (iii) whether those circumstances taken cumulatively form a chain so far complete that there is no escape from B the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused; (iv) whether they are consistent only with the hypothesis of the accused being guilty; and (v) whether they exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved. 27. In the instant case, the key circumstances on basis whereof C the prosecution seeks to bring home the charge against the two accused are: (a) the apartment from where body of the deceased was recovered on 12.09.2000 stood in the tenancy and possession of Santosh @ Bhure; D (b) the autopsy report confirmed homicidal death of the deceased as a result of infliction of multiple wounds from a sharp-edged weapon; (c) the spillage of blood on the floor of the apartment and on the cot from where the body was lifted confirmed that E murder took place in that very apartment; (d) the suicide letter found in a pocket of the trouser worn by the deceased at the time of his death was, as per FSL report, in the writing of co-accused Neeraj; (e) from 12.09.2000 till 23.09.2000 accused Santosh and Neeraj F were not traceable and could be apprehended only on 23.09.2000; (f) the two accused, in police custody, on 23.09.2000 and 25.09.2000, made confessional disclosures assuring recovery of (a) the dagger used in the crime, and (b) blood- G stained clothes worn by the accused on the date of the incident; (g) pursuant to the disclosure made on 25.09.2000, at the instance of Santosh, blood-stained clothes were recovered from a garbage dump at the rooftop of the same building H 742 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A where the body of the deceased was found on 12.09.2000; and, at the instance of Neeraj, a dagger/knife was recovered from the bushes behind a hospital; (h) though, the dagger carried no blood but the doctor opined that its use could have caused such injuries as were noticed B on the body of the deceased; (i) the FSL report confirmed presence of human blood of same blood group on the recovered clothes as was found on the clothes which the deceased was wearing at the time of death; C (j) except bald denial, the accused person(s) failed to offer a cogent explanation of the incriminating circumstances appearing against them. 28. Having enumerated the incriminating circumstances relied by the prosecution, we shall now examine – (a) whether the above-mentioned D circumstances have been proved beyond reasonable doubt; and (b) if so, whether they, individually or cumulatively, unerringly point towards the guilt of the two accused, or any one of the two accused, and rule out all other hypothesis except the one to be proved.
