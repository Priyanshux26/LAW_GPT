It is an admitted fact that there is no notification issued by the Government to this effect. However, the university was aware of the continuous demand of the Government to follow the method of selection provided in the 2001 Rules. Therefore, in compliance with the statutory requirement and the Governmental demand, it issued the advertisement declaring that the ‘Mode of Selection’ shall be as per the 2001 Rules. 19. There have been letters by the Government demanding compliance with the 2001 Rules while filling up the backlog vacancies for posts for SCs/STs and OBCs. We will now refer to these letters. Even before the advertisement was issued on 21.03.2018, there was a letter addressed by the Principal Secretary, Department of Higher Education, State of Karnataka, to the university on 27.02.2018, instructing the latter to fill up backlog teaching posts as per the 2001 Rules and the guidelines prescribed by the university. We may mention at this very stage that similar letters were addressed by the State Government to the university on 22.05.2018 and 09.06.2021, directing that the procedure contemplated under the 2001 Rules must be followed for filling up the vacancies of SC/ST and other backward classes in the university. With these letters, the issue relating to the legality and validity of the university’s advertisement is beyond doubt. 20. While we reject the submission of Mr. Shailesh Madiyal that the advertisement declaring that the 2001 Rules will be the ‘Mode of Selection’, is a mistake, we also hold that the university is bound to 482 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports comply with what is declared in its advertisement: the 2001 Rules will be the guiding principles for the selection in question. We state this for the following reasons. Firstly, there was no uncertainty left after the introduction of sub-Section (1A) to Sec. 4 of the Reservation Act, 1990, requiring an establishment, i.e., the university, to take action for filling the backlog vacancies as a one-time measure by following the method prescribed by the Government. Secondly, the purpose and object of the amendment was amply clear from its SOR contemplating the application of the 2001 Rules for the universities. Thirdly, the conduct of the university in not responding to the categorical demands of the Government through its letters dated 27.02.2018, 22.05.2018 and 09.06.2021 to implement the 2001 Rules is conclusive about its acceptance of the applicable law and the policy, and therefore, the advertisement. Hence, the requirement of the Government to specify the manner, procedure and time for identifying, filling backlog vacancies and completing the same was amply clear to the university. It is with this view that the university advertised that the ‘Mode of Selection’ shall be as per the 2001 Rules. 21. For the reasons stated above, the writ petition filed by respondent no. 7 was rightly allowed by the Ld. Single Judge of the High Court. While re-iterating the reasoning of the Single Judge, the Division Bench by the detailed , upheld the findings of the Single Judge.
