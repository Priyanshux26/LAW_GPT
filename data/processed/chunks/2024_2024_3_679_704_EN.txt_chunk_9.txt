So contending, the learned ASG prayed that no case has been made out to set aside the on charge and the charges and the appeals deserve to be dismissed. Question: 22. Under the above circumstances, the question that arises for consideration is: Whether the courts below were justified in refusing to quash and set aside the on charge dated 21.02.2006 and the charges as framed on 28.02.2006? [2024] 3 S.C.R. 693 Puneet Sabharwal v. CBI Analysis: 23. Having heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the records, we are of the opinion that the appellants have not made out a case for interference with the on charge dated 21.02.2006 and the of framing charge dated 28.02.2006. We say so for the following reasons. 24. The case of the prosecution is that the appellant R.C. Sabharwal, the father of appellant Puneet Sabharwal, owned assets to the tune of Rs. 2,05,63,341/- and that this was disproportionate to his known sources of income which was computed at Rs. 1,23,18,091/-. The allegation against the son Puneet Sabharwal was that he had received Rs. 79 lakhs through encashment of Special Bearer Bonds and he facilitated commission of offence inasmuch as assets were acquired by appellant R.C. Sabharwal in the name of M/s Morni Devi Brij Lal Trust, M/s Morni Merchants and other firms in which the sole beneficiary was appellant Puneet Sabharwal. The framing charge invokes Section 109 IPC to be read with Section 13(1)(e) read with Section 13(2) of the PC Act against Puneet Sabharwal. 25. The main plank of the arguments of the appellants is that the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal dated 31.08.2007, has, while allowing the appeals of the assessees and dismissing the cross appeals of the department (except to a small extent which too got settled with the assessment of 30.12.2009), held that no case was made out to justify that the income and assets of the entities such as the Morni Lal Brij Trust were to be added to the income of R.C. Sabharwal. In view of the same, it is argued that there is no case for prosecuting them for owning disproportionate assets. 26. It is argued that per se the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal should result in quashment of proceedings and the discharge of the accused. Additionally, it is argued that on the ground that analogous tax proceedings have ended in favour of the appellants, a criminal prosecution on identical facts cannot continue. For this, reliance is placed on the s mentioned hereinabove. 27. We have already discussed the substance of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal of 31.08.2007. In law, the submissions of the appellants ought to fail on both the counts as there is no basis to nip the criminal prosecution in this case in its bud. 694 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 28. As far as the first argument about the criminal proceedings losing its efficacy in view of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal of 31.08.2007 is concerned, we accept the submission of the respondent CBI that the prior rulings of the court ending with the in Selvi J. Jayalalitha (supra) have clearly concluded the issue against the appellants.
