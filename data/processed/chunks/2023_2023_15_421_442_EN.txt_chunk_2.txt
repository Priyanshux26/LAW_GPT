PREFACE 1. We are tasked to decide two civil appeals that centre around a common question: whether the educational institutions in question, viz. (i) the Indian Institute of Technology, Patna (“IIT Patna”, hereafter) and (ii) the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela (“NIT Rourkela”, hereafter), are covered by the defi nition of “governmental authority” in Mega Service Tax Exemption Notifi cation1 (“Exemption Notifi cation”, hereafter) inter alia exempting various services from the tax network rendered to government, governmental, or local authorities. If “governmental authority” as defi ned in the Exemption Notifi cation takes within its embrace IIT Patna and NIT Rourkela, they would be eligible for an exemption from the service tax that otherwise applies to construction services provided by service providers or subcontractors within their premises.
