The following conclusions can be drawn from a consolidated reading of the above provisions in the three enactments: i) There are no specific requirements in Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 or any other provision in the Arbitration Act, 1996 as a whole, which provide for necessary stamping for validity of an arbitration agreement F or elaborate generally on the same. ii) Even though Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 recognises oral agreements, a written agreement is sine- qua-non for a valid arbitration agreement. G iii) “Signing” is just an example of one of the conditions that may satisfy the form of an arbitration agreement. Thus, the mandatory requirement of a signature is ruled out for an arbitration agreement in Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. Since Section 7(2)(c) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 recognises even exchange of claim and defence as written H M/s N. N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PRIVATE LIMITED v. M/s 469 INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD. & ORS. [HRISHIKESH ROY, J.] arbitration agreements, there is no signing requirement. Even A if a written arbitration agreement is not signed, the parties can still be bound to an arbitration agreement58. However, Section 17 of the Stamp Act, 1899 provides for the timing of stamping i.e. before or at the time of execution and the term “execution” is defined in the Stamp Act, 1899 to mean B “signature” iv) Even though arbitral “awards” are liable to stamp duty under Item 12 of the Stamp Act, 1899 and are specifically mentioned in Schedule I ; the arbitration agreement for the purpose of stamp duty, gets covered only under the C residuary entry viz “if not otherwise provided for” in Article 5(c). The Stamp Act, 1899 does not specifically refer to an arbitration agreement. v) As per Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, Arbitration Agreement can even be non-contractual. D vi) Section 7(4)(c) of Arbitration Act, 1996 envisages that the scope of arbitration is not limited to the dispute initially referred to arbitration, but also encompasses any disputes that are included in the pleadings of the parties i.e. statement of claim and defence. E 78.2 The Appointment Of Arbitrators By The Chief Justice Of India Scheme, 1996 provides inter alia for the original or certified copy of the “arbitration agreement” for a Section 11(6) application. I completely agree with the opinion of my Learned Brother, Justice K.M. Joseph that an arbitration agreement has to comply with the indispensable requirements under the Contract Act, 1872 such as competency to F contract and presence of sound mind. However, when it comes to “formal” validity which could include requirements of signature, stamps, seals; I’m unable to concur that the evidentiary bar under Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899 should be juxtaposed with Section 2(g) and (2h) of the Contract Act, 1872 to make the agreement “void”. For example, G as per Section 10 of the Contract Act, 1872, even oral agreements are 58 Chennai Container Terminal Pvt Ltd v. Union of India, 2007 3 Arb LR 218 (Mad), Fisser v.
