4.5. Again, before the expiry of three years, an OTS proposal was submitted within three years by the Corporate Debtor on 16.03.2017 and again before expiry of three years from the said date, a fresh OTS proposal was submitted on 01.01.2018. Taking the last date of OTS proposal dated 01.01.2018 acknowledging the debt, the limitation for initiating Insolvency proceedings would run up to 31.12.2020. The petition under Section 7 IBC having been fi led on 22.01.2020, which was well within time. 5. The arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant by Shri Sanjiv Sen, learned Senior Counsel are summarized as under: a) Respondent No. 2 admitted in its Section 7 petition that there was a delay of 1392 days. According to it, the Corporate Debtor was declared as NPA on 28.06.2013, with eff ect from 31.03.2013, as per the Balance Sheet. Accordingly, applications seeking condonation of delay were fi led by State Bank of India. The period of limitation, which is three years, would thus expire on 31.03.2016. b) As per the website of the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs, the Corporate Debtor was shown as an inactive company since 2016 with the last date of the AGM being 26.09.2016. c) Respondent No. 2 relied upon the Balance Sheet of the fi nancial year ending 31.03.2015, in which the date was acknowledged by the Corporate Debtor and as such the limitation would run up to three years from the said date of the balance sheet, which 588 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. would extend up to 31.03.2018, and it was on this premise that Respondent No. 2 made an application stating that the actual delay was not 1392 days but 662 days. d) Respondent No. 2, apart from declaring the Corporate Debtor as NPA on 28.06.2013, had further participated before the High Court of Bombay by moving applications objecting to the said proceedings, where it had failed. Section 7 petition was fi led thereafter on 22.01.2020. e) Before the NCLAT, the Respondent No. 2 further improved its case by referring to an OTS proposal dated 16.02.2019 as an acknowledgement of the debt. However, this was objected to on the ground that even if it is assumed that the Corporate Debtor acknowledged the debt as per the Balance Sheet of the fi nancial year ending 31.03.2015, the period of limitation from the said date having expired on 31.03.2018, the OTS proposal dated 16.05.2019 would be beyond the period of limitation and, as such, would be of no assistance to the Respondent No. 2. f) The Respondent No. 2, before this Court, fi led documents which were not presented either before the National Company Law Tribunal10 or the NCLAT, relating to two other OTS proposals dated 16.03.2017 and 01.01.2018. These documents were introduced for the fi rst time by way of additional evidence before this Court. However, such documents as additional evidence should not be entertained nor were admissible before this Court in a Civil Appeal. g) The Respondent No. 2, from time to time, had been improving its case, which is not permissible under law and amounted to an abuse of process of law and the same needs to be deprecated.
