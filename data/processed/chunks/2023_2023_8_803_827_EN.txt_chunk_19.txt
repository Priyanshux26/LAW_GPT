Having regard to all the facts and circumstances, while we are inclined to set aside the impugned , we also feel that the interests of justice would require that the respondent is paid a lumpsum amount in full and final satisfaction of all his claims. Accordingly, the appeals are E allowed. The impugned is set aside. However, we direct that the appellants will pay a global sum of Rs.3 lakhs (Rupees Three Lakhs only) to the respondent which will be in full and final settlement of the claims of the respondent. The said payment of the amount of Rs.3 lakhs shall be effected within a period of six weeks from today. No s as to costs. F Divya Pandey Appeals allowed. (Assisted by : Roopanshi Virang, LCRA) G H
