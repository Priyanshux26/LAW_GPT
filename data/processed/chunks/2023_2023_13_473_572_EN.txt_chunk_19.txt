xxx xxx xxx 43. Clause 10(ii) of the Complaint Mechanism provides that complaint shall contain all the material and details concerning the alleged sexual harassment. What were the allegations in the complaint fi led on 30.08.2011 after the petitioner had fi led an ejahar on 26.08.2011 1 have already been taken note of. A perusal of the above ten points would go to show that Point Nos. 1 to 6, 7 (b) to (f), 9 and 10 are no way connected to the complaint dated 30.08.2011. Two inquiries had UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS v. DILIP PAUL 503 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] also taken place and, after more than a year later, after lodging of the complaint dated 30.08.2011, another complaint with many allegations was submitted to the Chairperson of the CCC on 18.09.2012. In our considered opinion, the CCC could not have entertained such a complaint for the purpose of a disciplinary proceeding in absence of entrustment in terms of Standing .” (Emphasis supplied) (ii) Secondly, the Central Complaints Committee while conducting the inquiry, could not have assumed the role of a prosecutor by putting questions to the witnesses.
