H ANOOP BARANWAL v. UNION OF INDIA 11 This Court has no doubt that there is considerable merit in the A complaint of the petitioner, which apparently, is endorsed by the Election Commission of India itself. This Court cannot be oblivious to the need for articulation of details in regard to the expenditure, which is a matter of policy, which this Court refrains from doing. This Court would only make an appeal on the basis B that there is an urgent need to provide for a permanent Secretariat and also to provide that the expenditure be charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and it is for the Union of India to seriously consider bringing in the much-needed changes. [Paras 236 and 238][181-F-G; 182-B-D] C 13. The Writ Petitions are partly allowed and they are disposed of as follows: I. As far as appointment to the posts of Chief Election Commissioner and the Election Commissioners are concerned, the same shall be done by the President of India on the basis of the advice tendered by a Committee consisting of the Prime Minister of India, the Leader of the Opposition in the D Lok Sabha and, in case, there is no such Leader, the Leader of the largest Party in the Opposition in the Lok Sabha having the largest numerical strength, and the Chief Justice of India. This norm will continue to hold good till a law is made by the Parliament. II. As regards the relief relating to putting in place a permanent E Secretariat for the Election Commission of India and charging its expenditure to the Consolidated Fund of India is concerned, the Court makes a fervent appeal that the Union of India/Parliament may consider bringing in the necessary changes so that the Election Commission of India becomes truly independent.
