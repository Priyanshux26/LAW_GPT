Learned senior counsel has B submitted that wherever the legislature intended to confer the power to grant compound interest, an enabling provision has been incorporated in the statute. In this regard, the learned counsel has given several examples, like Section 16 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006; Section 5 of the Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993; Section 23 of the Trusts C Act, 1882; Section 8 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972; Section 7 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Amendment Act, 2015; and Section 3 of the Usurious Loans Act, 1918. Learned counsel has cited the decision of this Court in the case of Central Bank of India v. Ravindra: (2002) 1 SCC 367 in support of the submissions D that with the contract not providing so, compound interest could not have been awarded. It has also been contended that in the absence of any agreement or any statutory provision or mercantile usage, interest payable could only be at the market rate and could never be compounded at whopping 14%. Learned counsel has also relied upon the decision in Clariant International Ltd. and Anr. v. Securities & Exchange Board E of India: (2004) 8 SCC 524. 8.2. In the second limb of submissions, learned senior counsel for the appellants has contended that in the recent decisions, this Court has only awarded simple interest with the rates ranging from 6% to 9% p.a. in the cases of deficiency of service by the builders. In this regard, F learned counsel has referred to the rate of interest awarded in Experion Developers Pvt. Ltd. v. Sushma Ashok Shiroor: (2022) SCC OnLine SC 416; NBCC (India) Ltd. v. Shri Ram Trivedi: (2021) 5 SCC 273; Ireo Grace Realtech Pvt. Ltd. v. Abhishek Khanna and Ors. : (2021) 3 SCC 241; DLF Home Developers Limited and Anr. v. G Capital Greens Flat Buyers Association and Ors. : (2021) 5 SCC 537; Arifur Rahman Khan and Ors v. DLF Southern Homes Pvt Ltd and Ors. : (2020) 16 SCC 512 and DLF Home Panchkula Pvt Ltd and Ors. v. DS Dhanda and Ors. : (2020) 16 SCC 318. The learned counsel has particularly referred to the passage in the case of Ireo Grace Realtech (supra) wherein, the prayer for compound interest H 1116 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A @ 20% was rejected, for having no nexus with the commercial realities of the prevailing market. Learned counsel would submit that in the face of such decisions, taking even the highest interest rate at 9% p.a., the total amount with interest payable to the respondent on 09.05.2022 (the date of issuance of notice by this Court) would be Rs. 49,87,129/- whereas the respondent has already withdrawn a sum of Rs. 2,55,95,119/-, which B was deposited by the appellants pursuant to the directions of the National Commission and then by this Court, alongwith accrued interest. It has been submitted that the amount so received by the respondent would be approximately equal to the principal amount together with simple interest @ over 60% p.a., calculated from the year 1989 to the month of June, C 2022.
