5. The statement of Rajesh (PW-11) was that on 10.04.2004 while he was driving from Chandigarh to Hisar, about half a kilometre before Karnal bypass his vehicle got punctured. As he was changing the wheel, he saw four young people on motorcycle coming from eastern side and they had to slow down because of the Karnal bypass. At that time, he saw the accused were carrying dandas and one of the boy’s clothes were stained with blood. Being suspicious he noted the registration number of the motorcycle being HR 08 E 4962. This witness also says that he read about the murder of the deceased in the newspaper two days later, i.e. on 12.04.2004 and while he was returning back to Chandigarh on 13.04.2004, he saw a police vehicle standing at the Karnal bypass Chowk with some police officials and the accused. He stopped his vehicle and informed the police about the occurrence on 10.04.2004. The prosecution thus relied on this person in support of the case as a witness to have last seen the deceased with the accused. 6. Similarly, PW-12 made a statement to the police. His version is that he is a resident of Sector 19/1 Huda, Kaithal and on 10.04.2004, he was taking an evening walk on Kaithal Road T-Point near Huda Road/Street. About 9.45-10 pm, while urinating by the roadside, he saw a motorcycle ridden by 3 young boys of about 20-21 years of age holding dandas in their hands. He recognised the appellant and when he started coughing, that is while urinating, the 3 boys drove away towards Karnal Road. His statement was recorded by the police on 12.04.2004. 7. The police also recorded the statement of one Dilbag Singh, later examined as PW-16 who recorded his version of having seen the deceased in the company of the accused at the same spot. 8. It is the case of the prosecution that on 17.04.2004, the Appellant (A-1), Sumit Gupta (A-2), Anil & Jaswinder surrendered before the investigating officer through Ex-Sarpanch of village Geong, Balbir Singh (PW-10) to whom the accused made an extra-judicial confession. Pursuant to the surrender, the prosecution says that 310 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports disclosure statements of A-1, A-2, Anil & Jaswinder were recorded, and certain recoveries were also made. 9. Upon completion of investigation, charge sheet was filed. It may be mentioned at this stage that prosecution of Anil and Jaswinder was separated from this case after they were declared to be juveniles. Thus, only the Appellant and Sumit Gupta (A-2) stood trial. Before the Trial Court, the prosecution examined 24 witnesses and marked certain exhibits. The defence on the other hand examined 3 witnesses as DW 1, 2 and 3. 10. The Trial Court having noticed that there are no eyewitnesses and that the case of the prosecution is based only on circumstantial evidence, copiously referred to the statements of each witness, but rested its decision only on the evidence of PW-10, 11 & 12 and certain recoveries and the FSL Report.
