The substantial principle of requiring a sanction for prosecution and at the same time the principle in not negating the sentence or of a court of competent jurisdiction are both incorporated in the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Criminal Procedure Code. The Court balances these values by the measure of whether failure of justice has in fact been occasioned. 11. Though a contrary view seems to have been taken in State of Goa v. Babu Thomas,6 a larger bench of this Court in State of M.P. v. Virender Kumar Tripathi7 has explained the position and affirmed the principles as laid down in Ashok Tshering Bhutia v. State of Sikkim8. 12. Justice Gogoi, (as he then was) has explained this position in State of Bihar (supra): “6. In a situation where under both the enactments any error, omission or irregularity in the sanction, which would also include the competence of the authority to grant sanction, does not vitiate the eventual conclusion in the trial including the conviction and sentence, unless of course a failure of justice has occurred, it is difficult to see how at the intermediary stage a criminal prosecution can be nullified or interdicted on account of any such error, omission or irregularity in the sanction without arriving at the satisfaction that a failure of justice has also been occasioned. This is what was decided by this Court in State v. T. Venkatesh Murthy9 wherein it has been inter alia observed that: 6 [2005] Supp. 3 SCR 712 : (2005) 8 SCC 130 7 [2009] 7 SCR 89 : (2009) 15 SCC 533 8 [2011] 3 SCR 242 : (2011) 4 SCC 402 9 [2004] Supp. 4 SCR 279 : (2004) 7 SCC 763 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 2140 paras 10 and 11, SCC p. 767, para 14 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 541 Central Bureau of Investigation v. Jagat Ram “14. … Merely because there is any omission, error or irregularity in the matter of according sanction, that does not affect the validity of the proceeding unless the court records the satisfaction that such error, omission or irregularity has resulted in failure of justice.” 7. The above view also found reiteration in Parkash Singh Badal v. State of Punjab [(2007) 1 SCC 1 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 193 (para 29)] wherein it was, inter alia, held that mere omission, error or irregularity in sanction is not to be considered fatal unless it has resulted in failure of justice. In Parkash Singh Badal [(2007) 1 SCC 1 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 193 (para 29)] it was further held that Section 19(1) of the PC Act is a matter of procedure and does not go to the root of jurisdiction. On the same line is the decision of this Court in R. Venkatkrishnan v. CBI [(2009) 11 SCC 737 : (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 164] . In fact, a three-Judge Bench in State of M.P. v. Virender Kumar Tripathi [(2009) 15 SCC 533 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 667] while considering an identical issue, namely, the validity of the grant of sanction by the Additional Secretary of the Department of Law and Legislative Affairs of the Government of Madhya Pradesh instead of the authority in the parent department, this Court held that in view of Section 19(3) of the PC Act, interdicting a criminal proceeding mid-course on ground of invalidity of the sanction will not be appropriate unless the court can also reach the conclusion that failure of justice had been occasioned by any such error, omission or irregularity in the sanction.
