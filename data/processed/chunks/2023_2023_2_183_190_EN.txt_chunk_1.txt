These appeals by way of special leave petitions are directed against the and dated 07.11.2019 passed by Delhi High Court dismissing Crl.L.P. Nos.315 to 322 of 2019 filed by the appellant against the of Metropolitan Magistrate-04 (N.I. Act)/South East, Saket Courts, New Delhi (for short “learned Magistrate”) dated C 25.01.2019 dismissing Criminal Complaints No.621744/16, 1718/16, 1276/ 16, 1277/16, 621743/16, 621742/16, 12742/17 and 12744/17 for non- appearance of the complainant (the appellant herein). 3. The short question that arises for our consideration in these appeals is whether in the facts of the case, the learned Magistrate was D justified in dismissing the criminal complaints for non-appearance of the complainant even though the statement of the complainant had been recorded and, vide of the learned Magistrate dated 26.10.2017, the complainant’s evidence was closed with a direction to list the matter for recording of defence evidence as also for consideration of application under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short E “the Code”) filed by the complainant. 4. To appropriately address the aforesaid issue, it would be apposite to give a brief sketch of the facts giving rise to these appeals. 5. The appellant in all filed eight complaints against the respondents F under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Three complaints were filed in the year 2011, three in the year 2013 and remaining two in the year 2017. Out of the aforesaid eight complaints, in Complaint Case Nos.621742/16, 621743/16 and 621744/16 the complainant was subjected to cross-examination. On 26.10.2017, the learned counsel for the accused made a statement before the learned G Magistrate that the cross-examination of CW-1 (the complainant), as made in the above three cases, shall be adopted in the remaining complaints. On basis of the above statement, the complainant’s evidence was closed and the cases were directed to be listed for recording of defence evidence. At that stage, an application was filed by the H 186 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A complainant under Section 311 of the Code for summoning certain witnesses. While the matter was pending at that stage, according to the appellant, appellant’s counsel misled the appellant into a belief that appellant’s presence is not required as a settlement was being negotiated.
