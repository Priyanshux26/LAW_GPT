Section 100 (4) of the Cr.P.C. that falls under Chapter VII titled “Process to Compel the Production of Things”, states as follows : 46 Ex.DW-1/A 47 (1981) 2 SCC 166 48 (2002) 2 SCC 426 49 (2014) 7 SCC 716 50 (2014) 11 SCC 355 BALWINDER SINGH (BINDA) v. THE NARCOTICS 121 CONTROL BUREAU [HIMA KOHLI, J.] “100. Persons in charge of closed place to allow search – (4). Before making a search under this Chapter, the offi cer or other person about to make it shall call upon two or more independent and respectable inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate or of any other locality if no such inhabitant of the said locality is available or is willing to be a witness to the search, to attend and witness the search and may issue an in writing to them or any of them so to do.” 25. It can be discerned from a bare reading of the aforesaid provision that it is a general provision relating to search and applies to a closed place, as for example, a residence, offi ce, shop, a built-up premises etc, where a search is required to be conducted by the investigation. It is in this context that sub-section (4) of Section 100 Cr.P.C. provides that to maintain the purity of the process, before undertaking a search, a couple of independent and respectable inhabitants of the locality where the place to be searched is located, be joined as witnesses to the search. 26. In the case at hand, the naka was laid by the offi cials of the NCB in an open area near the roundabout of Sectors 24/25, Chandigarh. Such was the location that there was no inhabitant in the vicinity and the time of the naka was an unearthly hour of 01.00 a.m. on 12th December, 2005. In this background, the two independent witnesses who were driving from Jalandhar towards Chandigarh, were fl agged down by the NCB offi cers and joined in the investigation. Therefore, the shadow of doubt sought to be cast on the testimony of Sonu8 by claiming that he was the real culprit, is clearly a trumped up story that cannot be sustained. The other independent witness, Mukesh Kumar, had turned hostile and the prosecution did not examine him. As a consequence, the two defence witnesses, Parkash Ram31 and Ravi Kant Pawar32 produced by the appellant – Satnam Singh5 to demonstrate that Mukesh Kumar was a stock witness, would hardly be of any assistance. The other procedural discrepancies sought to be pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant – Satnam Singh5 and referred to in paras 4.3 and 4.4 above, are not considered so vital in nature as to unsettle or demolish the entire case set up by the prosecution against the appellant – Satnam Singh5. 122 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. (IV) CONCLUSION 27. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the opinion that the appellant – Satnam Singh5 has failed to make out a case for acquittal.
