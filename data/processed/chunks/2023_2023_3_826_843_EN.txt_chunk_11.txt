28.We have carefully perused the s relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent, however, none of the s F relied upon permit the abuse of remand under Section 309(2) of the CrPC by permitting the filing of incomplete chargesheets only to scuttle the right of statutory bail. 29. The in State of West Bengal vs. Salap Service Station & Ors.11 relied upon by the respondent was rendered, not in the G context of default bail, but only in the context of entitlement u/s. 173(8) 9 (1995) 4 SCC 190 10 (2018) 16 SCC 158 11 1994 Supp (3) SCC 318 H 842 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A of the CrPC to place on record further evidence in support of the chargesheet already filed. 30.Further, the of Dharam Pal vs. State Of Haryana & Ors.12, relied upon by the respondent, refers to the power of Constitutional Courts to transfer investigation. In Para 21 of the said B , it has been stated that Section 173 empowers the police officer to conduct an investigation to file a report on the completion of the investigation and section 173(8) CrPC allows the conduct of further investigation. However, this also does not talk about default bail and the misuse of the filing of supplementary chargesheets. It is also important to note that the of Ram Narain Popli vs. CBI13 C and Rajesh Ranjan Yadav vs. CBI14 have also not dealt with the issues being considered by us in the present matter. 31.In light of the abovementioned discussion, the s relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent are clearly distinguishable as issues being considered herein were not considered therein and reliance D placed by the learned counsel for the respondents on the said pronouncements is totally misfounded. 32.In view of the above mentioned discussions, the issues framed by us stand answered as under:- I. Without completing the investigation of a case, a E chargesheet or prosecution complaint cannot be filed by an investigating agency only to deprive an arrested accused of his right to default bail under Section 167(2) of the CrPC. II. Such a chargesheet, if filed by an investigating authority without first completing the investigation, would not F extinguish the right to default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC. III. The trial court, in such cases, cannot continue to remand an arrested person beyond the maximum stipulated time without offering the arrested person default bail. G 12 2016 (4) SCC 160 13 (2003) 3 SCC 641 H 14 (2007) 1 SCC 70 RITU CHHABARIA v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 843 [KRISHNA MURARI, J.] CONCLUSION A 33. In the instant case, it is clear from the facts that during the pendency of the investigation, supplementary chargesheets were filed by the Investigation Agency just before the expiry of 60 days, with the purpose of scuttling the right to default bail accrued in favour the accused. This factual position was missed by the trial court, and instead of offering B default bail to the accused, the trial court mechanically accepted the incomplete chargesheets filed by the Investigating Agency, and further continued the remand of the accused beyond the maximum period specified.
