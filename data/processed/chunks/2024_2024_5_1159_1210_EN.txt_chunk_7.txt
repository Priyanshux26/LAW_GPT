As a matter of fact, the High Court found all the ingredients of section 24(2) of the 2013 Act as interpreted by the Supreme Court to be satisfied despite Award No.15/87- 88 dated 5th June 1987 and hence, declared the acquisition proceedings to have lapsed. b) Aggrieved thereby, the beneficiary of the acquisition proceedings- Delhi Development Authority (second respondent herein) (“DDA”, hereafter), carried such and in appeal praying for it to be set aside. After granting leave, a Bench of two Hon’ble Judges of this Court vide and dated 3 GNCTD & Anr. v. M/S BSK Realtors LLP & Anr., Diary No. 17623/2021 4 W.P. (C) No. 7442/2015 5 (2014) 3 SCC 183 1170 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 31st August, 2016 dismissed the Civil Appeal.6 It was observed that the issue, in principle, had already been adjudicated against DDA in a previous and of a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in a related matter.7 DDA was granted extension by a period of one year to avail the liberty of initiating acquisition proceedings afresh under section 24(2) of the 2013 Act. This marked the culmination of the first round of litigation. c) However, on 06th March, 2020, the decision in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) was overturned by a Constitution Bench of five Hon’ble Judges in Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal and others [5-Judge, lapse] 8 holding that land acquisition proceedings lapse only when the twin conditions are met, i.e., non-payment of compensation to the landowners together with failure of the State to take physical possession of the acquired lands. Leveraging this, Government of NCT of Delhi (first appellant herein) (“GNCTD”, hereafter) approached this Court through a SLP9 (the lead matter) wherein M/s BSK Realtors LLP and DDA were impleaded as the first and second respondents, respectively. It was contended on behalf of GNCTD that the and dated 11th January, 2016 rendered by the High Court ought to be reconsidered in view of Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra). d) A preliminary objection qua the maintainability of the SLP was raised by M/s BSK Realtors LLP. The first contention in line with the doctrine of merger was that the of the High Court dated 11th January, 2016 had merged with the dated 31st August, 2016 of this Court whereby the civil appeal at the instance of DDA was dismissed. Such dismissal, M/s BSK Realtors LLP further contended, was after grant of leave and by a speaking upon hearing all the parties involved. M/s BSK Realtors LLP also contended that the dated 11th January, 2016, upon its merger with the dated 31st August, 2016, ceased to exist and GNCTD being a party to the 6 Civil Appeal No. 8670/2016 7 Civil Appeal No. 8477/2016 arising out of SLP (Civil) No. 8467/2015 8 [2020] 3 SCR 1 : (2020) 8 SCC 129 9 Diary No. 17623/2021 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1171 Government of NCT of Delhi & Anr. v. M/s BSK Realtors LLP & Anr. civil appeal filed by DDA, the same would disentitle GNCTD from initiating a new round of litigation to have the dated 11th January, 2016 reversed on the specious ground that the decision in Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra) has been rendered after dismissal of the civil appeal of DDA, overruling the decision in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra).
