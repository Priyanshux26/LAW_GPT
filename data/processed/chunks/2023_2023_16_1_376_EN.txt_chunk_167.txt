This position of law was not diluted by Ragunathrao Ganpatrao (supra). In the present case, Article 370(1)(c) read with the proviso to Article 370(3) provides a procedure by which Article 370 may be modifi ed. Articles 370(1)(d) and 367 cannot be used for a collateral purpose in eff ect to modify or obliterate Article 370. V. Previous Constitutional s which modifi ed Article 367 401. The Union of India argued that CO 272 was not the first Constitutional issued to modify Article 370 through Article 367. It 276 (1973) 4 SCC 225 236 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. fl agged that this mechanism has been followed consistently in the past. The following Constitutional s were issued from time to time, which appear to modify or alter Article 370: a. Constitutional 44,277 issued in 1952; b. Constitutional 48,278 issued in 1954; c. Constitutional 56,279 issued in 1958; and d. Constitutional 74,280 issued in 1965. 402. The manner in which these Constitutional s sought to modify Article 370 is germane to this Court’s enquiry as to the validity of paragraph 2 of CO 272. They are considered in turn. 403. CO 44 was issued by the President in exercise of the power under Article 370(3). The relevant part reads thus “In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (3) of article 370 of the Constitution of India, the President, on the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, is pleased to declare that, as from the 17th day of November, 1952, the said article 370 shall be operative with the modifi cation that for the “Explanation” in clause (1) thereof the following Explanation is substituted, namely: - “Explanation - For the purposes of this article, the Government of the State means the person for the time being recognised by the President on the recommendation of the Legislative Assembly of the State as the Sadar-i-Riyasat of Jammu and Kashmir, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers of the State for the time being in offi ce.” (emphasis supplied) 404. CO 44 modifi ed the application of Article 370 by substituting the Explanation in sub-clause (b) of clause (1). Signifi cantly, CO 44 was 277 “CO 44” 278 “CO 48” 279 “CO 56” 280 “CO 74” IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 237 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] issued on the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir. At that time, the Constituent Assembly was functioning. It was dissolved only in 1957 and until then, the procedure contemplated by the proviso to Article 370(3) could be (and was) followed. The modifi cation of CO 44 was therefore valid and not comparable to paragraph 2 of CO 272. 405. The President issued CO 48 in exercise of the power under Article 370(1)(d). This Constitutional applied various provisions of the Constitution of India, with some modifi cations, to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. One of the modifi cations was sought to be eff ected by adding a provision to Article 367: “(14) PART XIX.
