Further, an appellate proceeding is a continuation of the original proceeding. A change in law can always be applied to original or appellate proceedings. Thus, Explanation 2 is constitutionally valid and despite having retrospective operation, it does not impair vested rights. 9 (2020) 8 SCC 531. 124 [2024] 1 S.C.R. DIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS 24. We must also take note of the second submission of the appellant in this regard relying upon Explanation 2(i), inter alia, on the ground that the final approval to the resolution plan by the NCLT was vide dated 04.09.2019, which is after the notification of the Amendment Act on 16.08.2019. The first provisionally/ conditionally approving the resolution plan was dated 24.07.2019 and hence, the effect of the Amendment Act could not have been considered and applied by the NCLT. There is merit in the contention of the appellant, but we need not firmly decide this issue, for we are of the opinion that the Amendment Act was certainly applicable when the appeals were heard and decided by the NCLAT on 18.11.2019 and 09.12.2019, which was post the enforcement of the Amendment Act. 25. The second question relates to the interpretation of Section 30(2) (b)(ii) of the Code. As we read Section 30(2)(b)(ii), the dissenting financial creditor is entitled to payment, which should not be less than the amount payable under Section 53(1), in the event of the liquidation of the corporate debtor. The provision recognises that all financial creditors need not be similarly situated. Secured financial creditors may have distinct sets of securities. There are a number of decisions of this Court, viz. Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Limited (supra), Swiss Ribbons Private Limited and Another v. Union of India and Others10, and Vallal RCK v. Siva Industries and Holdings Limited and Others11, which have held that the commercial wisdom of the CoC must be respected. Therefore, the resolution plan accepted by the requisite creditors/members of the CoC upon voting, is enforceable and binding on all creditors. The CoC can decide the manner of distribution of resolution proceeds amongst creditors and others, but Section 30(2)(b) protects the dissenting financial creditor and operational creditors by ensuring that they are paid a minimum amount that is not lesser than their entitlement upon the liquidation of the corporate debtor. 26. The Code had been enacted to balance the interests of various stakeholders, inter alia, by facilitating the resolution of insolvency, promoting investment, maximising the value of assets, and increasing the availability of credit. Secured credit is important for commerce 10 (2019) 4 SCC 17. 11 (2022) 9 SCC 803. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 125 DBS BANK LIMITED SINGAPORE v. RUCHI SOYA INDUSTRIES LIMITED AND ANOTHER as it reduces credit risk and carries lower interest due to lower loss value in the event of failure. On the resolution plan being approved, an unwilling secured creditor does and must forgo the security, albeit such an unwilling secured creditor is entitled to the value of the security as payable on the liquidation of the corporate debtor.
