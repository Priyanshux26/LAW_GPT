[Para 11.5] [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1149 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – ss.13(1)(d)/13(2) – Penal Code, 1860 – s.120-B r/w. ss.409/420 – Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 – What is the effect of the absence of any strategy in the Mining plan to dispose off the coal rejects: Held: The explanation offered by the appellants that at that point in time, the Central Government had not come out with any specific plan to dispose off the coal rejects is validated by the reply furnished by the Minister of State, MoC, in the Lok Sabha in response to an unstarred question seeking an answer from the Government of India as to whether it had framed any National Policy for exploitation of the coal rejects – The reply given was that the Government had not framed any National Policy for exploitation of coal rejects and the same was still under consideration – That being the position, it was left to KPCL and KECML to devise a satisfactory and safe method to dispose off the coal rejects – This was done in terms of Article 5(2)(b) of the JVA that required KECML to dispose off the rejects in a manner that would ensure that there was no threat to the environment – This Court does not find any irregularity in the route adopted to dispose off the coal rejects. [Para 13.2] Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – ss.13(1)(d)/13(2) – Penal Code, 1860 – s.120-B r/w. ss.409/420 – Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 – Was KECML required to account for the coal rejects: Held: The clauses of the JVA and FSA clearly indicate that KECML was only obliged to provide a specified grade of washed coal (Grade – D) having a specific GCV in the range of 4200-4940 Kcal/kg – When coal has been defined in the JVA and FSA as “washed coal with guaranteed value” and one that satisfied the parameters laid down in Annex-1 attached to the JVA and FSA and further, KECML was required to ensure that all “shales/stones” are removed from the coal before making the supply, there was no occasion for KECML to account for the rejects – All that KPCL was required to do was to buy from KECML, the washed coal with a particular guaranteed value and one that would satisfy the specified quality parameters, at a predetermined price – The agreement governing the parties required KECML to dispose off the rejects safely – KECML was not required to account for the coal rejects to KPCL. [Para 14.3] 1150 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – ss.13(1)(d)/13(2) – Penal Code, 1860 – s.120-B r/w. ss.409/420 – Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 – Can KECML be blamed for not setting up the coal washery at the pithead: Held: KECML could not be faulted for failing to set up the coal washery at the pithead, in terms of the JVA as that was for reasons beyond its control which included a prolonged litigation between the MoC and CIPCO in relation to the very same coal blocks allocated to KPCL which in turn delayed the project considerably – Production of coal could only commence in September, 2008 when the curtains were drawn on the aforesaid litigation – The Board of KPCL consciously acceded to the proposal made by KECML that a MoU be executed with GCWL for washing of mined coal at its washery – Pertinently, GCWL was not an unknown entity to KPCL as the latter had prior dealings with the said Company for washing of mined coal in another project – This decision taken by the parties in their commercial wisdom has been sought to be selectively tainted with criminal intention attributed to the appellants, without any basis.
