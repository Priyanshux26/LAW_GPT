It suggested that this would impact revenue collection because individuals and entities would not be in a position to pay the assessed taxes. Therefore, the World Bank advised deferral of tax filings and payment deadlines to allow individuals and business entities to cope with the crisis.123 Many countries across the world have extended deadlines for filing tax returns.124 63. TOLA extended the time limits for completion or compliance of certain actions under the specified Act, which fell for completion during the COVID-19 outbreak. The use of the expression “any” in Section 3(1) indicates that the relaxation applies to “all” or “every” action whose time limit falls for completion from 20 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. Section 3(1) is only concerned with the performance of actions contemplated under the provisions of the specified Acts. Consequently, the amendment or substitution of a provision under the specified Acts will not affect the application of TOLA, so long as the action contemplated under the provision falls for completion during the period specified by TOLA, that is, 20 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. 122 Cary Coglianese and Neysun Mahboubi, ‘Administrative Law in a Time of Crisis: Comparing National Responses to COVID-19’ (2021) 73(1) Administrative Law Review 1, 10. 123 Cebreiro Gomez, et al, COVID-19: Revenue Administration Implications – Potential Tax Administration and Customs Measures to Respond to the Crisis, World Bank Group (2022) 19 124 See International Monetary Fund, Policy Responses to COVID-19 https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf- and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1685 Union of India & Ors. v. Rajeev Bansal 64. When enacting a statute, the legislature often endeavours to ensure that the provisions of one legislation do not conflict with provisions of another legislation.125 The purpose of the Income Tax Act is to levy tax on income and raise revenues for the functioning of the Government. On the other hand, the purpose of TOLA is to provide relaxation of the time for completion of any actions or proceedings falling for completion within a particular period. Thus, the two enactments operate in separate and distinct fields. This Court must ensure that the provisions of the two enactments are interpreted harmoniously unless there is an irreconcilable conflict between them. b. Reading TOLA into Section 149 65. Section 3(1) of TOLA applies to the action of “issuance of any notice” under the Income Tax Act. The relaxation provided under Section 3(1) of TOLA will apply to the issuance of a reassessment notice under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act. TOLA did not amend the time limits of four years and six years from the end of the relevant assessment years as specified under the Income Tax Act. It merely provided a relaxation of the time period for issuance of a reassessment notice under Section 148. TOLA has no application in situations where the time limit specified under Section 149 expired before 20 March 2020. The effect of TOLA is that at the time of issuance of a reassessment notice under Section 148, the Revenue has to determine two things: (i) the time limit specified under Section 149; and (ii) the extent of relaxation provided by TOLA and its notifications for issuance of notices.
