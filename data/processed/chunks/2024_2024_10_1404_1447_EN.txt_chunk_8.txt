Submissions 13. Mr K K Venugopal, Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Mr Arvind Datar and Mr Prashanto Chandra Sen, Senior Counsel, and Ms Neelam Rathore, counsel appeared for the respondents. They submitted that the appeal filed by AERA is not maintainable for the following reasons: a. AERA which is a tariff fixing authority, cannot be an “aggrieved party” at any stage of the proceedings. Since it cannot file an appeal before TDSAT, it also cannot file an appeal before this Court under Section 31 of the Act assailing the of TDSAT. Section 18(2) provides that “any person” aggrieved by any direction, decision or made by the Authority may prefer an appeal to TDSAT. AERA will not be covered by the expression “any person” since that would amount to AERA challenging its own ; b. AERA cannot defend its own actions in the appeal against its since tariff determination is a quasi-judicial function: i. Numerous s of this Court have held that tariff determination is a quasi-judicial exercise (see PTC India v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission,18 BSES Rajdhani Power Limited v. Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission,19 Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd v. Union of India20 and GRIDCO v. Western Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Limited21); ii. The procedure followed by AERA while fixing tariff elucidates that it is a quasi-judicial exercise. Section 13(4) 16 “CPC” 17 “31.
