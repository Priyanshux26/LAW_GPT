In other words, as the said Regulation stood in the year 2019, it was incumbent for the Liquidator to have constituted the Stakeholders’ Consultation Committee and the explanation now offered, is a sheer afterthought. 29. Another argument advanced is that if it is assumed that the Auction Purchaser could take refuge of the dated 23rd March, 2020 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1285 V.S. Palanivel v. P. Sriram, CS, Liquidator, Etc. passed by this Court in the Suo Moto Writ Petition on account of the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic read with Regulation 47A of the IBBI Regulations, 2016, in the light of the dated 17th November, 2021 passed by the Adjudicating Authority, the last date for making the deposit by the Auction Purchaser could be extended upto 23rd July, 2020 and not beyond that. 30. Learned senior counsel concluded by vehemently contesting the submission made by the other side that the appellant’s conduct showed that he was obstructing the liquidation process. He sought to distinguish the in Bombay Mercantile Corporative Bank Limited v. U.P. Gun House and Others43 cited by the other side on facts and submitted that vide dated 5th December, 2023, that this Court had passed in the present Appeals, the Auction Purchaser was restrained from creating any third-party rights. It was argued that had the sale been cancelled under Rule 12, second proviso to Schedule I under Regulation 33 of the IBBI Regulations, 2016 and the subject property put to auction once again, there was a strong possibility that the same would have fetched a much higher amount. But due to the casual manner in which the respondents have conducted themselves, the appellant and the shareholders have lost the valuable property and suffered a huge loss. Without prejudice to the submission made above, learned counsel submitted that should the Court be inclined to accept the pleas taken by the respondents in opposition to the appeals, then it would only be fair to direct the Auction Purchaser to compensate the appellant for the loss of the value of the property which was assessed by the registered Valuers in the year 2019, at ₹48,00,00,000/- (Rupees Forty eight crores only). G. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 31. This Court has given its thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties, perused the records and the s cited on both sides. We shall now deal with the contentions raised by learned counsel for the appellant ad seriatim. 32.
