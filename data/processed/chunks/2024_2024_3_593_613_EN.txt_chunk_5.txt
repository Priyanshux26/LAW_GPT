10. Aggrieved by this development and complaining that they were not given notice or a hearing prior to the Government’s decision, the 600 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports appellants preferred an appeal before the Commissioner, Poona, assailing the direction of the Collector, Poona, to the Mamlatdar, Haveli, to hand over possession of the subject lands to the tenants. The Commissioner, Poona, rejected their request, vide letter dated 02.12.1964. They then approached the Chief Minister, State of Maharashtra, by way of written representation dated 11.12.1964. However, they were informed by the Officer on Special Duty, Revenue and Forest Department, Government of Maharashtra, vide letter dated 30.12.1964, that their representation dated 11.12.1964 could not be considered. Aggrieved by the rejection of their representation under letter dated 30.12.1964, the appellants filed Special Civil Application No. 61 of 1965 before the Bombay High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution. Interim stay was granted therein on 15.01.1965 and the case was disposed of on 25.03.1969, in these terms: ‘By consent, the Court makes absolute the rule granted by it on 15.01.1965, sets aside the of the State Government dated 01.11.1963 communicated to the petitioners on 10.07.1964 by the Officer on Special Duty and remands the matter to Government with a direction to rehear the matter after giving opportunity to the petitioners and the respondents to be heard in their defence. No as to costs.’ 11. The revision was taken up as Case No. PTIL-3464/102644-L-5 by the Officer on Special Duty (Appeals and Revisions), Revenue and Forest Department, Government of Maharashtra. This revision was allowed by dated 03.05.1982 and all the s passed by the authorities against the tenants were set aside. In consequence, the lands were directed to be restored to the tenants. In the dated 03.05.1982, it was noted that the Abolition Act had come into force on 01.01.1963 but as on that date, the tenants were not in possession as it was an admitted fact that the appellants were delivered possession on 24.04.1962. However, the revisional authority opined that the mere factum of losing possession would not be determinative of termination of the tenancy and if the to that effect was based on a wrong presumption or wrong interpretation of law, the tenancy could not be said to have been terminated even if such an was executed. The authority opined that the argument that the possession of the tenants became unauthorized upon the [2024] 3 S.C.R. 601 Baban Balaji More (Dead) by LRs. & others v. Babaji Hari Shelar (Dead) by LRs. & others death of the original Watandar and that no tenancy rights subsisted on the appointed date, viz., 01.01.1963, could not be accepted. The authority concluded that the Assistant Collector’s and Additional Collector’s s in deciding the case under Section 11 of the 1874 Act, ignoring the provisions of the Tenancy Act, were wrong. In effect, the authority held that the tenancy must be presumed to be continuing and that the s passed to the contrary were improper and illegal and, consequently, execution of such s had no effect on the rights of the tenants.
