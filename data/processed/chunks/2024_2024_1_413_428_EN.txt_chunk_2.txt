2 for partition and separate possession of the plaint schedule properties. I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND 3. A genealogy is prefaced to appreciate the relationship between the parties: - M.S. Muthusamy Gounder (Died in 1982) Chinnammal (D-4/A-2) Ramayee (P-2/R-2) Ammasi Ammal (D-2/R-4) Raja Gounder (D- Gangammal (D- M. Sengodan Subramani Shaktivel(Dead) 3/A-1) 5/A-3) (P-1/R-1) (D-1/R-3) [Son] [Son] [Daughter] [Son] [Son] 4. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in this Civil Appeal were the Plaintiffs in O.S. No. 357 of 1985 before the Trial Court filed for partition and separate possession of plaint schedule properties. The plaint schedule consists of three items of agricultural land in Amani, Kliyanoor, Agraharam and Pallipayam villages of Tiruchengode Taluk. The suit was filed against Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 herein. During the pendency of the suit, the Appellants filed I.A. No. 1019 of 1987 and were impleaded by the Trial Court as Defendant Nos. 3, 4 and 5. 5. Muthusamy Gounder is the propositus of the parties to the suit and the claim for partition arose on his demise in the year 1982. The plaint averments are that Respondent No. 1 is the son of the propositus through Respondent No. 2/Ramayee. Respondent No. 3 is also the son of the propositus through Respondent No. 4/Ammasi Ammal. The marriage of Respondent No. 2 with the propositus is alleged to have happened in the early 1950s. It is averred in the plaint that Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 lived together and had a common kitchen during the lifetime of Muthusamy Gounder. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 claim that a coparcenary/joint Hindu family existed, and Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 inherited the plaint schedule properties. The plaint schedule properties are treated as joint family/ancestral properties. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 417 Raja Gounder and Others v. M. Sengodan and Others The demand of Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 through legal notice dated 21.06.1984 did not result in a reply from Respondent Nos. 3 and 4, or result in partition, the suit for partition of plaint schedule into three equal shares was filed and allot to Respondent Nos. 1 and 3, each one such share. The other share notionally allotted to Muthusamy Gounder, and since he died in 1982, is divided and allotted to Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 in accordance with law. 6. We have specifically referred to the share demanded by Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in O.S. No. 357 of 1985 because the shares of the parties resulted in change with the impleadment of Appellants. Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 filed written statements denying the factum of marriage between Respondent No. 2 and Muthusamy Gounder, stating that Respondent No. 1 alone is a member of the Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) of Muthusamy Gounder. 6.1 As a natural result of the denial of marriage and relationship between Muthusamy Gounder and Respondent No. 2, the other averments in the plaint, namely, the existence of coparcenary and ancestral properties; the rights of Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for partition, are specifically denied. The Appellants as Defendant Nos.
