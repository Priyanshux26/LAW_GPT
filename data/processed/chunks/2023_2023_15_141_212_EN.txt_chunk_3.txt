M/S TIRUMALA 145 CONSTRUCTIONS Constitution of India – Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, 2016 – Maharashtra Act: Held: As far as the Maharashtra appeals are concerned, the assessees’ grievance is that the retrospective amendments, made to the Maharashtra VAT Act, were void – There is no quarrel with the proposition that a legislative body is competent to enact a curative legislation with retrospective eff ect – Yet, the same vice that attaches itself to the Gujarat amendment, i.e. lack of competence on the date the amendment was enacted i.e. in this case, 09.07.2019, the Maharashtra legislature ceased to have any authority over the subject matter, because the original entry 54 had undergone a substantial change, and the power to change the VAT Act, ceased, on 01.07.2017, when the GST regime came into eff ect – Therefore, for the same reasons, as in the other cases, the amendments to the Maharashtra VAT Act cannot survive.
