23. The Arbitration Act has given pre-eminence to party autonomy throughout the arbitral process. The Arbitration Act has used phrases such as “unless otherwise agreed by the parties”,31 “failing any agreement”,32 “the parties are free to agree”,33 “failing such agreement”,34 and “unless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means”35 to recognise the autonomy of parties to determine the arbitral proceedings. The use of the above phrases also indicates that an arbitrator is bound by the procedures agreed upon between the parties.36 24. Some of the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act which reflect the principle of party autonomy are encapsulated below: a. Section 10 allows parties the freedom to decide the number of arbitrators; b. Section 11(2) allows parties the freedom to agree on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators; c. The Proviso to Section 12(5) allows parties to waive the applicability of the provision by an express agreement in writing after the dispute has arisen; and d. Section 14 allows parties to mutually terminate the mandate of an arbitrator. 25. Additionally, the parties are free to agree on the procedures to be followed by the arbitral tribunal,37 the place of arbitration,38 the date 30 Section 5, Arbitration Act. [It reads: “5. Extent of judicial intervention – Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part.”] 31 Sections 3, 11(1), 14(2), 15(3), 15(4), 20(3), 21, 23(3), 24(1), 26, 29(1), 31(7a), 33(4), Arbitration Act 32 Sections 11(3), 11(5), 13(2), 19(3), 20(2), 22(2), Arbitration Act 33 Sections, 11(2), 13(1), 19(2), 20(1), 22(1), Arbitration Act 34 Section 34(2)(a)(v), Arbitration Act 35 Section 11(6), Arbitration Act 36 N S Nayak and Sons v. State of Goa (2003) 6 SCC 56 [14]; Sree Kamatchi Amman Constructions v. Railways (2010) 8 SCC 767 [19] 37 Section 19, Arbitration Act 38 Section 20, Arbitration Act 2208 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of commencement of arbitral proceedings,39 the language to be used in the arbitral proceedings,40 procedure for hearings and written proceedings,41 consequence of a default by a party,42 appointment of experts,43 and the manner of decision making by the arbitral tribunal.44 Thus, the Arbitration Act recognises and enforces mutual commercial bargains and understanding between the parties at all stages of the arbitration proceedings. However, the autonomy of the parties under the Arbitration Act is not without limits. It is limited by certain mandatory provisions of the Arbitration Act. ii. Mandatory provisions 26. Part I of the Arbitration Act applies where the place of arbitration is in India.45 Section 4 deals with a waiver of the right of a party to object in the following terms: “4. Waiver of right to object. – A party who knows that – (a) any provision of this Part from which the parties may derogate, or (b) any requirement under the arbitration agreement, has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating his objection to such non- compliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is provided for stating that objection, within that period of time, shall be deemed to have waived his right to so object.” 27.
