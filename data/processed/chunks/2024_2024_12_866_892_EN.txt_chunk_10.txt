It is the duty of the court to make such construction of a statute which shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy. While interpreting a statute the courts are required to keep in mind the consequences which are likely to flow upon the intended interpretation.” 9. The primary argument, as recorded above is that the resolution of disputes by alternate mechanisms is an aspect of the administration of justice and, therefore, anything connected thereto inclusive of refund of court fees as a result of out of Court settlement, would be governed by Entry 11A of List III. Further, the inconsistency between the Central and State Act would have to be resolved, giving the Central Act primacy over the State Act. This argument is difficult to countenance. 10. The scope of Entry 11A of List III has been discussed by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Jamshed N. Guzdar v. State of Maharashtra,18 in the following terms : 17 [2001] Supp. 5 SCR 152 : (2002) 2 SCC 96 18 [2005] 1 SCR 223 : (2005) 2 SCC 591 882 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports “42. The general jurisdiction of the High Courts is dealt with in Entry 11-A under the caption “administration of justice”, which has a wide meaning and includes administration of civil as well as criminal justice. The expression “administration of justice” has been used without any qualification or limitation wide enough to include the “powers” and “jurisdiction” of all the courts except the Supreme Court. The semicolon (;) after the words “administration of justice” in Entry 11-A has significance and meaning. The other words in the same entry after “administration of justice” only speak in relation to “constitution” and “organisation” of all the courts except the Supreme Court and High Courts. It follows that under Entry 11-A the State Legislature has no power to constitute and organise the Supreme Court and High Courts. It is an accepted principle of construction of a Constitution that everything necessary for the exercise of powers is included in the grant of power. The State Legislature being an appropriate body to legislate in respect of “administration of justice” and to invest all courts within the State including the High Court with general jurisdiction and powers in all matters, civil and criminal, it must follow that it can invest the High Court with such general jurisdiction and powers including the territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction and also to take away such jurisdiction and powers from the High Court except those, which are specifically conferred under the Constitution on the High Courts.” (Emphasis Supplied) It is also important to note the discussion made by Y.V Chandrachud, CJI while writing for the majority of the seven Judges Bench in In Re The Special Courts Bill, 1978.19 The relevant extract thereof is as under: “45. The field of legislation covered by Entry 11-A of List III was originally a part of Entry 3 of List II. By Section 57(b) (iii) of the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976 which came into force on January 3, 1977 that part was omitted from Entry 19 [1979] 2 SCR 476 : (1979) 1 SCC 380 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
