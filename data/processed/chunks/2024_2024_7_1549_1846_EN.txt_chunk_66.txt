Section 3(fa) defines “production” or any derivative of the word “production” to mean the winning or raising 118 Section 3(h), MMDR Act 119 Mineral Concession Rules 1960, Schedule III 120 Section 3(c), MMDR Act 121 Gujarat Pottery Works v. B P Sood [1967] 1 SCR 695 [18]; Bhagwan Dass v. State of Uttar Pradesh (1976) 3 SCC 784 [13]. [Justice Y V Chandrachud (as the learned Chief Justice then was) observed: “In any case, the definition of mining operations and minor minerals in Section 3(d) and (e) of the Act of 1957 and Rule 2(5) and (7) of the Rules of 1963 shows that minerals need not be subterranean and that mining operations cover every operation undertaken for the purpose of “winning” any minor mineral. “Winning” does not imply a hazardous or perilous activity. The word simply means “extracting a mineral” and is used generally to indicate any activity by which a mineral is secured. “Extracting”, in turn, means, drawing out or obtaining. A tooth is ‘extracted’ as much as is fruit juice and as much as a mineral. Only, that the effort varies from tooth to tooth, from fruit to fruit and from mineral to mineral.”] 122 (1979) 3 SCC 106 [15] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1635 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. of mineral within the leased area for the purpose of processing or dispatch. The expression “dispatch” has been defined to mean the removal of minerals or mineral products from the leased area and to include the consumption of minerals and mineral products within such area.123 It is worth noting that royalty is payable under Section 9 on the removal or consumption of minerals by the lessee in the leased area. Thus, essentially royalty is payable on the dispatch of minerals from the leased area. 88. This segment indicates that under a lease deed for mining operations, the owner transfers the interest in the minerals to the lessee in lieu of the payment of rent, which usually takes the form of royalty. To answer whether this payment is akin to a tax, we must understand the nature of a mining lease under the MMDR Act. b. The nature of a mining lease under the MMDR Act and the Mineral Concession Rules 1960 89. The MMDR Act and the Mineral Concession Rules 1960 detail the procedure for the grant of mining leases in three situations: first, where the minerals vest in the government;124 second, where the minerals vest in a person other than the government;125 and third, where the minerals vest partly in the government and partly in a private person.126 Chapter IV of the Mineral Concession Rules 1960 (containing Rules 22 to 40) deals with the grant of mining leases in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the government. Rule 22(1) provides that an application for the grant of a mining lease in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the government shall be made to the State Government.
