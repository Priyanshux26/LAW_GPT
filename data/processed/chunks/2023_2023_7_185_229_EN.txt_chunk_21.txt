46. As there was no corresponding notification exempting the additional duties leviable under Sections 3 (7) and (9) CTA, exporters D had to pay IGST and compensation cess and seek input tax credit as applicable under the GST Rules. Import under AA, however, continued to be exempt from payment of basic customs duty and additional customs duty specified in subsections (1), (3) and (5) of section 3 of the CTA, education cess, anti-dumping duty, safeguard duty and transition product E specific safeguard duty, wherever applicable. 47. Since IGST and compensation cess was levied against AAs, they were apparently challenged before the Delhi High Court in several petitions, wherein interim relief was granted. Because of the initial problems relating to GST, the committed refund of IGST got delayed, resulting in blocking of working capital for many businesses. The Union F then issued an amending notification dated 13-10-2017 in exercise of powers under Section 25 (1) of the Customs Act, 1962 (Notification 79/ 2017 - dated 13.10.2017) inter alia amending the opening paragraph of Notification 18 / 2015 (dated 1.4.2015) whereby goods imported into India were exempted from the whole of the duty of customs leviable G thereon, specified in the First Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 and from the whole of the additional duty leviable thereon under sub- sections (1), (3) and (5) of Section 3, IGST leviable thereon under sub- section (7) of section 3 and compensation cess leviable under sub-section (9) of section 3. The amending notification also introduced a proviso in condition (viii), after the proviso which reads thus: H 214 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A “Provided further that notwithstanding anything contained hereinabove for the said authorisations where the exemption from integrated tax and the goods and services tax compensation cess leviable thereon under sub-section (7) and sub-section (9) of section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act, has been availed, the export obligation shall be fulfilled by B physical exports only.” The said notification also inserted condition (xii) which reads thus: “(xii) that the exemption from integrated tax and the goods and services tax compensation cess leviable thereon under C sub-section (7) and sub-section (9) of section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act shall be subject to pre-import condition.” 48. Thus, exemption from levy of IGST under Section 3 (7) and compensation cess leviable under Section 3 (9) of Customs Tariff Act, 1975 were subject to the conditions that the export obligation shall be fulfilled by physical exports only and shall also be subject to ‘pre-import D condition’. Together with the amendment of the exemption notification, by Notification No. 33/2015-2020 (dated 13-10-2017), paragraph 4.14 of the FTP was also amended to read as follows: “4.14: Details of Duties exempted. E Imports under Advance Authorisation are exempted from payment of Basic Customs Duty, Additional Customs Duty, Education Cess, Anti-dumping Duty, Countervailing Duty, Safeguard Duty, Transition Product Specific Safeguard Duty, wherever applicable. Import against supplies covered under paragraph 7.02 (c), (d) and (g) of FTP will not be exempted F from payment of applicable Anti-dumping Duty, Countervailing Duty, Safeguard Duty and Transition Product Specific Safeguard Duty, if any.
