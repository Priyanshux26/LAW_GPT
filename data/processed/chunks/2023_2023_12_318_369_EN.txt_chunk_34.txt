Conversely, if a co-operative society is not a co-operative bank within the meaning of Section 56 of the BR Act, 1949, it would be entitled to the benefi t of deduction under Section 80P of the Act. 368 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 15.11. Looked at from another angle, a co-operative society which is not a state co-operative bank within the meaning of NABARD Act, 1981 would not be a co-operative bank within the meaning of Section 56 of the BR Act, 1949. In the instant case, as already noted in A.P. Varghese case, the Kerala State Co-operative Bank being declared as a state co-operative bank by the Kerala State Government in terms of NABARD Act, 1981 and the appellant society not being so declared, would imply that the appellant society is not a state co-operative bank. 15.12. In fact, in Citizen Co-operative Society Ltd., this Court held that the appellant therein was having both members as well as nominal members who were depositing and availing loan facilities from the appellant therein and therefore, appellant therein was not entitled to the benefi t of Section 80P of the Act as it was functioning as a co-operative bank. But, the appellant herein is not a co-operative bank and neither has it been so declared under the provisions of NABARD Act, 1981 or the State Act. On the other hand, under the provisions of State Act, 1969, the Kerala State Co-operative Bank has been so declared by the Government of Kerala as a co-operative bank. 15.13. Further, under the provisions of the State Act, 1984, ‘agricultural and rural development bank’ means the Kerala Co-operative Central Land Mortgage Bank Limited, registered under Section 10 of the Travancore- Cochin Co-operative Societies Act, 1951, which shall be known as Kerala State Co-operative Agricultural and Rural Development Bank Limited i.e. the appellant herein. Thus, from a conjoint reading of all the relevant statutory as alluded to hereinabove, it is quite clear that the appellant is not a co-operative bank within the meaning of sub-section (4) of Section 80P of the Act. The appellant is a co-operative credit society under Section 80P(2) (a)(i) of the Act whose primary object is to provide fi nancial accommodation to its members who are all other co-operative societies and not members of the public. 15.14. Therefore, when the defi nition of “co-operative bank” in Section 56 of BR Act, 1949 is viewed in terms of Sections 2(u) of the NABARD Act, 1981, it is clear that only a state co-operative bank would be within the scope and meaning of a banking company under Section 2(c) of the BR Act, 1949 on obtaining licence under Section 22 of the said Act. KSCARDB v. THE ASSESSING OFFICER, TRIVANDRUM 369 AND ORS. [B.V. NAGARATHNA, J.] Conclusion: In the instant case, although the appellant society is an apex co- operative society within the meaning of the State Act, 1984, it is not a co- operative bank within the meaning of Section 5(b) read with Section 56 of the BR Act, 1949.
