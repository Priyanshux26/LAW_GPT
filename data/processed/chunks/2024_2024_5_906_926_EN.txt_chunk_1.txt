Section 17(2(viii) is a residuary clause, enacted to provide flexibility – Since it is enacted as an enabling catch-within-domain provision, the residuary clause is not iron-cast and exacting – A more pragmatic and commonsensical approach can be adopted 908 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports by locating the prevalent meaning of ‘perquisites’ in common parlance and commercial usage – The expression ‘perquisite’ is well-understood by a common person who is conversant with the subject matter of a taxing statute – New International Webster’s Comprehensive Dictionary defines ‘perquisites’ as any incidental profit from service beyond salary or wages; hence, any privilege or benefit claimed due – Thus, ‘perquisite’ is a fringe benefit attached to the post held by the employee unlike ‘profit in lieu of salary’, which is a reward or recompense for past or future service – It is incidental to employment and in excess of or in addition to the salary. It is an advantage or benefit given because of employment, which otherwise would not be available – From this perspective, the employer’s grant of interest-free loans or loans at a concessional rate will certainly qualify as a ‘fringe benefit’ and ‘perquisite’, as understood through its natural usage in common parlance. [Paras 13-15, 18, and 19] Income Tax Act, 1961 – Section 17(2)(viii) – Rule 3(7)(i) – Income Tax Rules, 1962 does not lead to a delegation of the ‘essential legislative function’ to the CBDT. Held: A Constitution Bench of Seven Judges of this Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Birla Cotton, Spinning and Weaving Mills, Delhi and Another (1968) SCC Online SC 13, has held that the legislature must retain with itself the essential legislative function – ‘Essential legislative function’ means the determination of the legislative policy and its formulation as a binding rule of conduct – Therefore, once the legislature declares the legislative policy and lays down the standard through legislation, it can leave the remainder of the task to subordinate legislation – The test, therefore, is whether the primary legislation has stated with sufficient clarity, the legislative policy and the standards that are binding on subordinate authorities who frame the delegated legislation. Subordinate authority’s power under Section 17(2)(viii), to prescribe ‘any other fringe benefit or amenity’ as perquisite is not boundless – The express delineation does not take away the power of the legislature, as the plenary body, to delegate the rule-making authority to subordinate authorities, to bring within the ambit of ‘perquisites’ any other ‘fringe benefit’ or annuities’ as ‘perquisite’ – An unlimited right of delegation is not inherent in the legislative power itself – The legitimacy of delegation depends upon its usage as an ancillary measure, which the legislature considers necessary for the complete and effective exercise of legislative [2024] 5 S.C.R. 909 All India Bank Officers’ Confederation v. The Regional Manager, Central Bank of India and Others powers – Provided that the legislative policy is enunciated with sufficient clearness or a standard is laid down, the courts should not interfere with the discretion that undoubtedly rests with the legislature itself in determining the extent of delegation necessary in a particular case – An executive authority can be authorised by a statute to modify either existing or future laws but not in any essential feature – What constitutes an essential feature cannot be enunciated in exact terms – However, it was held that modification could not include a change in policy, since the ‘essential legislative function’ consists of the determination of legislative policy and its formulation as a binding rule of conduct – In the context of Section 17(2)(viii) and Rule 3(7)(i), we are of the opinion that main legislation does not fall foul of the essential feature test – They do not modify an essential feature nor do they violate the condition of determining legislative policy or a binding rule of conduct – A delegated legislation is not unconstitutional when the legislature leaves it to the executive to determine details relating to the working of taxation laws, such as selection of persons on whom the tax has to be levied, the rates at which it is to be charged in respect of different classes of goods and the like – The principal legislature has not given unqualified power to fix the rate of tax without guidance, control or safeguard – The power to decide who is to pay the tax is not an essential part of legislation, neither would the power to decide the rate of tax be so – The enactment of subordinate legislation for levying tax on interest free/concessional loans as a fringe benefit is within the rule making power under Section 17(2)(viii) of the Act – Section 17(2)(viii) itself, and the enactment of Rule 3(7)(i) is not a case of excessive delegation and falls within the parameters of permissible delegation.
