and others31, the Parent Act conferred power on the Delegate from the Government, to make Rules for carrying out the purpose of the Act, a familiar legislative device. The contention taken was that the Rule in question revealed the Delegate surpassing its authority. We notice the F following discussion: “8. … Tea estates are excluded from the provisions of the Act by Section 5. “Tea estate” is defined in the interpretation clause of the Act to mean an area under tea plantation and includes within the definition “such other area necessary for purposes subservient G to a tea plantation as may be prescribed”. Rule 3 defines what areas shall be treated as subservient to a tea plantation. The amendment made vide notification dated 4-4-1986 places an embargo on the right to transfer such subservient land though 30 (1988) 2 SCC 351 H 31 (2000) 3 SCC 40 ASSOCIATION OF VASANTH APARTMENTS’ OWNERS v. 1081 V. GOPINATH & ORS. [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] exempted from the operation of the Act. Clearly the impugned A proviso is beyond the rule-making power of the State Government as conferred by the Act. It is well settled that the legislature cannot delegate its essential legislative functions which consist in the determination or choosing of the legislative policy and of formally enacting that policy into a binding rule of conduct. What is permitted B is the delegation of ancillary or subordinate legislative functions, or, what is fictionally called, a power to fill up the details. [See: Principles of Statutory Interpretation, Justice G.P. Singh, (7th Edn., 1999, at pp. 689-90).] 9. In Supreme Court Employees’ Welfare Assn. v. Union of C India [(1989) 4 SCC 187 : 1989 SCC (L&S) 569 : AIR 1990 SC 334] this Court has held: “(A) delegated legislation or a subordinate legislation must conform exactly to the power granted.” (SCC p. 222, para 62) D “Rules, whether made under the Constitution or a statute, must be intra vires the parent law under which power has been delegated.” 10. In General Officer Commanding-in-Chief v. Dr Subhash Chandra Yadav [(1988) 2 SCC 351 : 1988 SCC (L&S) 542 : E (1988) 7 ATC 296 : AIR 1988 SC 876] it has been held: (SCC p. 357, para 14) “[B]efore a rule can have the effect of a statutory provision, two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (1) it must conform to the provisions of the statute under which it is framed; and (2) it must F also come within the scope and purview of the rule-making power of the authority framing the rule. If either of these two conditions is not fulfilled, the rule so framed would be void.” 54. Finally, we may notice Global Energy Ltd. and another v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission32. This Court laid down G as follows: “25. It is now a well-settled principle of law that the rule-making power “for carrying out the purpose of the Act” is a general delegation. Such a general delegation may not be held to be laying 32 (2009) 15 SCC 570 H 1082 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R.
