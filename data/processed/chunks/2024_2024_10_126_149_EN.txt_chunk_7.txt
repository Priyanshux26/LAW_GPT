Resultantly, the seniority/merit position at the time of induction in the trainee grade would have no bearing on the inter se seniority of the employees which would have to be reckoned from the date the employee is confirmed and promoted to the skilled grade upon completing the probation period and clearing the trade test. 20. He further placed reliance upon the Government 21 dated 24th December, 2002 issued by the Ordinance Factory Board, Ministry of Defence, Government of India, which was issued to clarify the counting of seniority in trades mentioned in SRO No. 185 of 1994 applicable to the Industrial Establishments and urged that the said GO clarifies beyond the pale of doubt that the semi-skilled grade is a trainee grade and the seniority will be counted from the date of promotion to the skilled grade and not from the date of induction/ entry in the semi-skilled grade. 19 [2006] Supp. 8 SCR 831 : (2007) 1 SCC 405 20 ‘SRO’, hereafter 21 ‘GO’, hereafter [2024] 10 S.C.R. 137 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others 21. Learned counsel pointed out that the two years’ probation period of the appellant was extended by six months w.e.f. 17th January, 1998, and the appellant could complete the probation period only on 16th July, 1998. Subsequently, upon passing the trade test, he was promoted to the skilled grade w.e.f. 6th January, 1999. The appellant lost the seniority on account of his failure to complete probation in the period of two years and clearing the trade test whereas, the private respondents herein had completed probation in time and were found to be fit in the trade test and therefore, they were promoted to the skilled grade much before the appellant. Consequently, these employees i.e. private respondents herein were placed higher in seniority, as per clarification issued by Ordinance Factory Board vide GO dated 24th December, 2002. On these grounds, learned counsel for the respondents implored the Court to dismiss the appeal and affirm the passed by the High Court. 22. Learned counsel for the private respondents herein22 adopted the submissions advanced by learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 and 2. 23. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced at the bar by learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the impugned and the material placed on record. Discussion and Conclusion: 24. The fact that the appellant and private respondents were inducted as semi-skilled grade employees in respondent No. 2-Factory in the year 1996 is not in dispute. The common select list dated 22nd November, 1995 is not placed on record by the parties. However, appellant filed an RTI,23 and the reply thereto dated 29th December, 2011 clearly shows that at the time of initial induction, appellant was placed at the 7th position, whereas the private respondents24 were placed at the 30th, 31st and 32nd positions, respectively in the select list based on merit. 22 Respondent Nos. 3, 4, and 5 23 Right to Information 24 Respondent Nos.
