These features shrouded the entire selection process into deeper suspicion, thereby further vitiating the appointment process as opined by the Division Bench. 7. With this understanding, the Division Bench directed that the TET- 2014 Eligibility List be treated as the Merit List to determine inter-se positions of the TET-2014 candidates, including those 252 applicants who had filed Writ Petitions before the High Court. Consequently, the Single Bench dated 26.09.2022 was modified to the effect that the 3929 left over vacancies were extended to all the remaining TET-2014 candidates, in descending of their inter-se 940 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports positions in the TET Eligibility List 2014, notwithstanding the fact that these vacancies were carried forward through a fresh recruitment Notification dated 29.09.2022. 8. Appeals herein have been filed by the Board & others to challenge the Division Bench dated 11.11.2022 of the Calcutta High Court in MAT 1734/2022 and I.A. No. CAN 1/2022. Submissions 9. The primary contention of Mr. Jaideep Gupta and Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned senior counsel, is rooted in the provisions of the Recruitment Rules, 2016. They would refer to the procedure of selection specified in Rule 8 of the Recruitment Rules, 2016 to contend that the Merit List is based on evaluation conducted on various parameters, following which marks are awarded to candidates. Eventually, the Merit List is published and thereafter, appointments are to be made on the basis of marks secured by the candidates in the evaluation process specified in the provisions. However, the directions issued by the Division Bench in the impugned provide for appointments to be made on the basis of candidates’ inter- se positions in the TET Eligibility List 2014, which is in contravention to the procedure specified under the Recruitment Rules, 2016. 10. It is then argued that the life of the panel/Merit List remains valid for a period of one year from the date of approval by the Board. In this case, since the panel was notified on 15.02.2021, it naturally expired after one year on 15.02.2022. In this case, candidates filed their Writ Petitions only in May 2022 i.e., approximately three months after the panel had expired. Therefore, no individual could have claimed any right of appointment in reference to the particular recruitment process after the panel had expired. 11. Additionally, Mr. Gupta pointed out that the 3929 vacancies that remained unfilled due to various factors were then carried forward through a Notification dated 29.09.2022 as part of the fresh recruitment cycle. Under the new process, 9500 appointments were already been made from the advertised 11,500 vacancies. It would therefore not be fair to dislodge the appointed candidates either from the previous or current recruitment cycle. 12. Appearing for those candidates who seek appointment to the 3929 left-over vacancies from the initial pool of 16,500 vacancies, Dr. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 941 Ali Hossain Mandal & Ors. v. West Bengal Board of Primary Education & Ors. Menaka Guruswamy, learned senior counsel contends that although the validity of the panel as per Rule 12 is one year, there is a provision to extend the validity of the same by six months at a time but the total period of such extension cannot exceed one year in any case.
