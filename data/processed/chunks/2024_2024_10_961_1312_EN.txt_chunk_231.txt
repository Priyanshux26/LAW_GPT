68. The following principles emerge from the discussions above: a. There is no general principle that the constitutional validity of under-inclusive provisions must be assessed with judicial deference; 118 [2018] 11 SCR 765 : (2019) 3 SCC 39 [Justice DY Chandrachud [11] 119 [2003] Supp. 1 SCR 580 : (2004) 3 SCC 609 120 “2001 Amendment” 121 [2003] Supp. 1 SCR 580 : (2004) 3 SCC 609 [20] 122 Gauri Shanker v. Union of India (1994) 6 SCC 349; Anant Mills v. State of Gujarat (1975) 2 SCC 175 123 [2003] Supp. 1 SCR 580 : (2004) 3 SCC 609 [23]. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1281 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 b. The degree of judicial scrutiny of an under-inclusive provision depends on the subject matter. The Courts must adopt a higher degree of judicial scrutiny if the law deals with core rights of individuals or groups (as opposed to economic policy); and c. The determination of the yardstick for classification will help in the assessment of whether a provision is under-inclusive or over-inclusive. The yardstick must have a nexus with the object and must be in consonance with constitutional principles. If the yardstick satisfies the test, then the State must determine if all persons/situations similarly situated based on the yardstick have been included. The State must on the submission of cogent reason justify if those who are similarly situated have not been included (under-inclusiveness) or those who are not similarly situated have been included (over-inclusiveness). The degree of justification that the State is required to discharge depends on the subject-matter of the law, that is whether the matter deals with economic policy or fiscal matters, whether it is a beneficial provision such as a labour provision or whether it deals with the core or innate traits of individuals. The degree of justification is the least for economic policy, higher for a beneficial provision and the highest if it infringes upon the core or innate trait of individuals. e. The legislative objective of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act 69. The preamble to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1985 by which Section 6A was included states that the amendment was made for the “purpose of giving effect to certain provisions of the Memorandum of Settlement relating to the foreigners issue in Assam (Assam Accord) which was laid before the Houses of Parliament on the 16th day of August 1985.” The Assam Accord was entered into in the backdrop of numerous agitations led by All Assam Students Union124 and All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad125 against the migration from Bangladesh to Assam. The movement saw foreigners as a threat to Assamese political power and as contenders of the scarce economic 124 “AASU” 125 “AAGSP” 1282 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
