The Hon’ble High Court rightly held that the Central Complaint Committee (CCC) was mandated by the authority to inquire into the complaint dated 30.08.2011. However, it is manifest from the inquiry report that the complaint submitted on 18.09.2012 was also taken into consideration. It was also noted by the Hon’ble High Court that the CCC in the report under the heading “VI. Charges which were admitted/dropped/not pressed” that the petitioner did not plead guilty to any of the allegations made by the complainant in her complaint dated 30.08.2011. Though the copy of the complaint dated 30.08.2011 was furnished, the same was not given in the form 510 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. of articles of charge. The requirement of the offi cer proceeded against to be formally asked whether he pleads guilty or not would, according to the understanding of the court, is not an opportunity to such offi cer only to answer the same in a mono-syllable. The Hon’ble High Court held that to give meaning to the word “formally”, a real and eff ective opportunity has to be granted to the offi cer concerned to make his comment in writing in response to the complaint. Apparently, no such opportunity was aff orded. There is no indication that in respect of the complaint dated 18.09.2012, the offi cer was even asked as to whether he pleads guilty to the allegations made therein or not. 8. That, the Hon’ble High Court at para 43 of its ( Page 70-71 of the SLP) rightly held that few points of allegations are no way connected to the complaint dated 30.08.2011. The Hon’ble High Court held that two inquiries had also taken place and, after more than a year later, after lodging of the complaint dated 30.08.2011, another complaint with many allegations was submitted to the Chairperson of the CCC on 18.09.2012. Accordingly the Hon’ble High Court rightly held that the CCC could not have entertained such a complaint for the purpose of a disciplinary proceeding in absence of entrustment in terms of Standing . 9. That, the Hon’ble High Court at para 44 & 45 of its (Page 71-74 of the SLP) rightly held that the s dated 26.11.2012, 27.11.2012, 28.11.2012 and 10.12.2012 go to show that the committee asked questions to the prosecution witnesses and examination-in-chief was done by the committee. Prosecution witness, Mr. S.C. Katoch, who was cross-examined by the complainant, in his statement had stated that the complainant had made only one call on his mobile and that she had mentioned that the sole respondent is harsh in his offi ce work and had given her duty in control room for which she is to sit in the control room after offi ce hours. He had, in other words, negated the assertions made in the complaint that she had informed about sexual harassment meted out by the sole respondent. The CCC, however, noted that it appeared that Shri Katoch had pre-judged the complaint as untrue. When his evidence was that there was no complaint of sexual harassment, there was no occasion for the CCC to opine that UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS v. DILIP PAUL 511 [J.
