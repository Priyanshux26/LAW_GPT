143-A refers specifically to the issuer of the cheque, not the authorized signatories – The High Court’s decision to interpret ‘drawer’ strictly as the issuer of the cheque, excluding authorized signatories, is well-founded – This interpretation aligns with the legislative intent, established legal precedents, and principles of statutory interpretation – The primary liability for an offence u/s. 138 lies with the company, and the company’s management is vicariously liable only under specific conditions provided in Section 141 – The appellants’ submissions are thus rejected, and the High Court’s is upheld – Thus, the question of law put before this Court is answered in negative.
