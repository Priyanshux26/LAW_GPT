Prosecution for certain classes of criminal conspiracy.—No Court shall take cognizance of the offence of criminal conspiracy punishable under Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code, [2024] 5 S.C.R. 1063 National Investigation Agency New Delhi v. Owais Amin @ Cherry & Ors. (1) in a case where the object of the conspiracy is to commit either an illegal act other than an offence, or a legal act by illegal means, or an offence to which the provisions of Section 196 apply, unless upon complaint made by or under authority from the State Government or some officer empowered by the State Government in this behalf, or (2) in a case where the object of the conspiracy is to commit any non-cognizable offence, or a cognizable offence not punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards, unless the State Government or a Chief Presidency Magistrate or District Magistrate empowered in this behalf by the State Government has, by in writing, consented to the initiation of the proceedings: Provided that where the criminal consipracy is one to which the provisions of sub-section (4) of Section 195 apply no such consent shall be necessary.” (emphasis supplied) 14. Section 4(1)(e) of CrPC, 1989 defines a complaint. Such a complaint includes an allegation made either orally or in writing. Certainly, there is no prescribed format for making a complaint, as even an oral allegation constitutes a complaint. 15. As per Section 196 of CrPC, 1989 which deals with the offences committed against the State, a jurisdictional court shall take cognizance only upon a complaint made by the of, or under the authority from the Government, or a District Magistrate, or such other officer as empowered by the Government for the aforesaid purpose. Thus, Section 196 of CrPC, 1989 forecloses any other methodology than the one provided thereunder. The compliance is mandatory, failing which a Court cannot take cognizance under Section 196 of CrPC, 1989. 16. Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 only deals with specified classes of criminal conspiracy for the purpose of prosecution. Section 120-B of RPC, 1989 deals with an offence pertaining to conspiracy, which 1064 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports is pari materia to Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Sub-section (1) of Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 speaks of the object of the conspiracy qua an illegal act other than an offence, a legal act by illegal means, or an offence to which Section 196 of CrPC, 1989 applies. For taking cognizance of such an offence, a complaint can only be made either by an of the Government, or under its authority, or by an officer empowered by it. In the case of Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989, cognizance of a complaint can be taken by a Court only after satisfying itself of the due compliance of sub-section (1) of Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 with respect to competence of the authority. 17. Though Sections 196 and 196-A of CrPC, 1989 seem to be similar insofar as the authority competent to convey a complaint is concerned, under Section 196 of CrPC, 1989, a District Magistrate can lodge it by himself, whereas, the same provision is not available under Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989.
