633 Sunita Devi v. The State of Bihar & Anr. law is the handmaid of justice – However, the ultimate issue is as to whether such an error or omission has constituted a failure of justice, which is one of fact, to be decided on the touchstone of prejudice. [Para 25] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.227, 228 – Discharge – Framing of charge – Constitution of India – Article 22: Held: Before the stage of framing of charges, the Judge is expected to discharge an accused, if he is of the considered view that there is no sufficient ground to proceed against the accused – This being a judicial exercise, his discretion must be supported by adequate reasons – In discharge of his powers, he has to consider the records and documents submitted by the prosecution vis-à -vis the arguments adduced by both sides – The words “after hearing the submissions of the accused” would imply an effective and meaningful hearing – It is not a mere procedural compliance – The duty of the Court is to see as to whether the materials produced by the prosecution are reasonably related to the offence attributed against the accused – What is to be seen is the existence of a prima facie case – The case is at a pre-framing stage and therefore, it cannot be a full-fledged pre-trial – Adequacy and sufficiency are the relevant factors to be seen – The test is one of the degree of probability – Section 227 gives effect to Article 22 of the Constitution – The right of an accused to be heard is inalienable – For exercising this right, there has to be due consultation – It is the duty of the court to ensure that the accused is given sufficient opportunities to consult his lawyer – Under sub-section (2) of Section 228 of the CrPC, 1973, the Judge, while framing any charge, is ordained to read and explain it to the accused – Thereafter, the accused shall be asked as to whether he pleads guilty of the offence charged or claims to be tried – This is an occasion where the Judge avoids the lawyer and keeps in touch with the accused directly – Unless a situation so warrants otherwise, the presence of the accused shall be ensured. [Paras 18-21] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.230, 231, 233, 309: Held: Sections 230, 231 are to be read in consonance with each other – At this stage, the Court is concerned only with the prosecution’s evidence – To ensure fair play, as a normal practice, the Court has to fix a date for the examination of the witnesses – The idea is to complete the examination-in-chief and cross examination, both at the same time – While fixing the 634 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports date, the Court is expected to take into consideration the relative convenience of the parties, though the discretion lies with it – A balance has to be struck between the competing interests – Further, when an application is moved invoking Section 233, the Judge is duty bound to issue process, unless he is satisfied on the existence of the three elements, as stated – Any denial would be an affront to the concept of a fair trial – Section 309 places emphasis on the continuation of the trial as any obstruction and delay would hamper the process of justice – Despite a bar under the second and fourth proviso to Section 309, an adjournment can be granted, provided the party who seeks so, satisfies the court.
