3 and 4 of the 2008, Rules to apply prospectively. [Paras 31, 32, 33] Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 – s.45(2) – Cognizance of offences – Independent review – Meaning – [2024] 10 S.C.R. 321 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. Plea that since both the recommending and the granting authorities took merely a day each in performing their respective functions, the requirement of an independent review which is to be undertaken by both authorities has been left unfulfilled thereby vitiating the sanction in question: Held: Independent review would mean a contemplation or study of the material gathered by the investigating officer to conclude as to whether or not a sanction to proceed under the provisions of the UAPA ought to be granted – Similarly, at the next stage, the sanctioning authority is to mull over and critically notice both the materials gathered as also the conclusion drawn by the recommending authority, in its act of granting sanction – Independence of this authority is sine qua non, without which it would have lost its entire purpose – Plea of the appellant that short amount of time taken in recommending and granting sanction, against him which is a sign of non-application of mind and lack of independent review, cannot be accepted – There is no question, as there rightly cannot be, on the competence of either of the authorities – Thus, solely on the ground that the time taken was comparatively short or even that other s were similarly worded cannot call the credibility of the sanction into question – Thus, independent review as well as application of mind are questions to be determined by way of evidence and as such should be raised at the stage of trial, so as to ensure that there is no undue delay in the proceedings reaching their logical and lawful conclusion on these grounds – If it is raised belatedly, however, the Court seized of the matter, must consider the reasons for the delay prior to delving into the merits of such objections – Belated challenges on these grounds cannot be allowed to act as roadblocks in trial or cannot be used as weapons in shirking away from convictions arising out of otherwise validly conducted prosecutions and trials – passed by an administrative authority is not to be tested by way of judicial review on the same anvil as a judicial or quasi-judicial – While it is imperative for the latter to record reasons for arriving at a particular decision, for the former it is sufficient to show that the authority passing such applied its mind to the relevant facts and materials – Thus, no infirmity in the granting sanction against the appellant – It is not incumbent upon such authority to record detailed reasons to support its conclusion and, as such, the s challenged, cannot be faulted with on that ground.

Digital Supreme Court Reports Words and phrases – Word independent – Meaning of: Held: Act, or evaluation is made in a way which is lone standing or which does not rely on any other factor, such as previous consideration or evaluation by another authority, to arrive at its conclusion – Independence, which is the state of being independent would also be instructive in the understanding – Review, as a concept is to be understood for it is the coming together of these two aspects which would form the understanding of the term ‘independent review’ – Import of the term independent review as can be understood, is a re-examination, scrutiny or critique of something which is not dependent or subject to control by any other factor or authority.
