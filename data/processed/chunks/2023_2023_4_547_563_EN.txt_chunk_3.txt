D 5. A civil suit (O.S. No. 22/2012) claimed relief against an of injunction restraining reconstruction and structural alterations by the appellant; the injunction was issued by the CEO of the trust/wakf. The appellants preferredthe suit and contended that the two, i.e.,wakf and trust could not co-exist because awakf creates a dedication in favour of E God while a trust vests the property in the hands of the trustees. The appellants preferred an application alleging that the suit was not maintainable, as a preliminary issue. The tribunal found in favour of the respondent/plaintiff, upon which the appellant approached the Kerala High Court5. A Division Bench of thecourt held6 the suit maintainable F before the tribunal. However, on the question of the plaintiff’s competence to seek injunction (before the tribunal)regarding specific tenanted properties, thecourt observed, “on behalf of the Wakf, against the defendant is a matter which will have to be independently considered and decided”as it was a “vexed” question of fact and law which could not be decided in a proceeding under 39, Rules 1 and 2 of the G Code of Civil Procedure. 3 dated 16.05.2005 4 CRP No. 106/2008, decided on 14.10.2008. 5 in CRP (Wakf) No. 375/2012. 6 By dated 05.08.2013, also reported as Norman Printing Bureau v PS Mamman Haji Wakf Trust 2013 (4) KLT 606.
