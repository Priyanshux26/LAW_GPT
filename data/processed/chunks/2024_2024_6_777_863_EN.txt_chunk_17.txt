However, any formal complaint received by respondent-Institute was acted upon within the framework provided in the Chartered Accountants Act and the Misconduct Rules, 2007 framed thereunder. 3.25 As per information provided by DGIT(Systems), ITD to the CAG in August, 2014: a. 65,898 Chartered Accountants submitted at least one Tax Audit Report (TAR) for AY 2013-14. Further, out of total 65,898 records of Chartered Accountants: i. 81.13% Chartered Accountants adhered to the limit of forty-five prescribed by ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India). ii. 18.87% submitted more than forty-five TARs (Tax Audit Reports). iii. Excess number of tax audits ranged from 46 to 2471. [2024] 6 S.C.R. 803 Shaji Poulose v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India & Others b. A table showing twenty-two Chartered Accountants who issued more than forty-five TARs for the annual year 2013- 2014 ranged from 401 TARs up to 2471 TARs. The CAG Report pointed out that the purpose of maintenance of quality audit work had suffered due to no monitoring mechanism of this crucial ceiling limit by either respondent-Institute or ITD as per the following statistics: Stratification of total TARs issued by Chartered Accountant for Assessment Year 2013-14 (vide CAG Report No. 32/2014, Section 3.6) Range of TARs Total Number of Percentage of Total issued Accountants Accountants 1-45 53,463 81.13 46-100 10,838 16.45 101-200 1,364 2.07 201-300 166 0.25 301-400 45 0.07 401-500 10 0.02 501-1000 11 0.02 > 1000 1 0 Total Accountants 65,898 100 Note: 81.13% adhered to the ceiling limit. Therefore, the CAG, at Section 3.11(d) Recommendations of the same Report recommended that the: d. Ministry may ensure limiting the tax audit assignments in to ensure quality of Tax Audit. 3.26 The Ministry replied contending that the respondent-Institute, as an expert statutory body, would lay down restrictions on the number of tax audits and be capable of enforcing it. However, the CAG noted that Chartered Accountants have been assigned very crucial work of tax audit and therefore, the introduction of a suitable control mechanism in the IT system, by the Ministry, 804 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in consultation with respondent-Institute, was in the interest of the revenue for ensuring quality of tax audit. 3.27 Respondent-Institute at its 339th Meeting held from 23.12.2014 to 25.12.2014 discussed the report of the CAG and in pursuance thereof, a group of Council Members was constituted on 24.01.2015 to study the report of the CAG for the year ending March, 2014 and place its findings before the Council for appropriate direction. The Council decided to refer all cases, where ceiling was exceeded, to the Director (Discipline). 3.28 It is averred that respondent-Institute had no mechanism to record exact data on number of tax audits undertaken by a Chartered Accountant until the respondent-Institute made it mandatory in 2019 that submission of all tax audit reports undertaken by a Chartered Accountants be marked with a ‘Unique Document Identification Number (‘UDIN’). Lacking such a mechanism, the respondent-Institute, seeking to initiate disciplinary proceedings for professional misconduct for carrying out tax audits assignments under Section 44AB of the IT Act, 1961, treated data gathered by the CAG as complaints and issued communications to some petitioner-Chartered Accountants who accepted more than specified limit of tax audits for the Assessment Year 2013-14, namely, forty-five.
