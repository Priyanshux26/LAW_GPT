2512 of 2015 by which the High Court has allowed the said writ petition and has declared that the acquisition with respect to the land in F question is deemed to have lapsed by virtue of Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as: “Act, 2013”), the Government of NCT of Delhi has preferred the present appeal. 2. From the impugned and passed by the High G Court, it appears that the award under Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1894”) with respect to the land in question was made as far as back on 12.07.2005. According to the appellant and so stated in the counter before the High Court, it was the specific case on behalf of the appellant that the possession of the H 226 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A land in question was taken on 31.08.2005. However, despite the above and relying upon the earlier decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. Vs. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki and Ors., (2014) 3 SCC 183, the High Court has allowed the writ petition and has declared that the acquisition with respect to the land in question is deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the B Act, 2013. 2.1 The decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. (supra), which has been heavily relied upon by the High Court while passing the impugned and has been subsequently overruled by this Court in the Constitution Bench decision C in the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and Ors. (2020) 8 SCC 129. In paragraphs 365 and 366, the Constitution Bench of this Court has observed and held as under:- “365. Resultantly, the decision rendered in Pune Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, D (2014) 3 SCC 183] is hereby overruled and all other decisions in which Pune Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183] has been followed, are also overruled. The decision in Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. [Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. v. State E of T.N., (2015) 3 SCC 353] cannot be said to be laying down good law, is overruled and other decisions following the same are also overruled. In Indore Development Authority v. Shailendra [(2018) 3 SCC 412], the aspect with respect to the proviso to Section 24(2) and whether “or” has to be read as “nor” or as “and” was not placed for consideration. Therefore, that decision F too cannot prevail, in the light of the discussion in the present . 366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under: 366.1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the G award is not made as on 1-1-2014, the date of commencement of the 2013 Act, there is no lapse of proceedings. Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of the 2013 Act.
