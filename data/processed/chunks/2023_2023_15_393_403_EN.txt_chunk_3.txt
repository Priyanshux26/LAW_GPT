The value (if any) of all such variations shall be taken into account in ascertaining the amount of the Agreement Price and its completion time.” 2.2. Sometime in the year 1988, the parties invoked the arbitration clause. The arbitrator gave an award dated 10.08.2002. Award was given in the currency of Iraq i.e., Iraqi Dinars. Following is the operative portion of the award: “After setting off the allowed counter claims of the respondent against the allowed claims of the claimant, I thus make the award as follows: - (a) The respondent shall pay ID 223777.14 (two lakh twenty- three thousand seven hundred seventy-seven and point one four) to the claimant along with 12% interest p.a. from date of commencement of arbitration proceedings i.e. 26.9.1988 to the date of payment. b) The respondent shall also pay to the claimant a sum of Rs.20,00,000/- (Rupees twenty lakh) along 12% interest p.a. from the date of encashment of Bank Guarantee upto the date of payment. c) The amount payable in ID shall be convertible into US dollars as per the original agreement dated 29.6.1982. Further, all payments of settlement in foreign exchange shall be made as per original agreement and Government rules. d) There shall be no as to cost and the parties are left to bear their own costs. Award made and pronounced at New Delhi on 10th August, 2002.” 2.3. Aggrieved by the said award, objections were fi led under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 19964 by the NPCCL 4 The 1996 Act NATIONAL PROJECTS CONSTRUCTION CORP. LTD. v. ROYAL 399 CONSTRUCTION COMPANY PVT. LTD. [VIKRAM NATH, J.] which were dismissed on 26.05.2008. Further, the appeal fi led under section 37 of the 1996 Act was disposed of, vide dated 19.05.2014 wherein the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court fi rstly, reduced the rate of interest from 12 % p.a. to 6% p.a. and secondly, fi xed the date of further conversion of US dollars into Indian Rupees as the date of the award i.e. 10.08.2002. A Review fi led by the appellant was also dismissed by the Division Bench on 19.09.2014. 2.4. Aggrieved by the same, the NPCCL preferred a Special Leave Petition before this Court. This Court vide dated 24.02.2015 after granting leave, allowed the appeal, set aside both the s of the Division Bench i.e. 19.05.2014 and 19.09.2014. This Court further held that whatever directions have been given in the award by the learned Arbitrator would govern the fi eld. This Court had further held that the date of conversion would be as per the original agreement dated 26.09.1982, as the learned Arbitrator had already in clear terms said so. It further was of the view that the midway approach of the Division Bench by reducing the rate of interest was also not justifi ed. It would be benefi cial to reproduce the last two paragraphs of the of this Court: “The issue that arises for consideration is whether the High Court should have fi xed the date of conversion contrary to the agreement and contrary to the award which is in consonance with the agreement and further reduced the rate of interest.
