Educational Services [B.K. Educational Services (P) Ltd. v. Paras Gupta & Associates, (2019) 11 SCC 633], Swiss Ribbons [Swiss Ribbons (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (2019) 4 SCC 17], K. Sashidhar [K.

Phoenix ARC (P) Ltd., (2019) 10 SCC 353] respectively, the following basics undoubtedly come to the fore: (a) that the Code is a beneficial legislation intended to put the corporate debtor back on its feet and is not a mere money recovery legislation; G (b) that CIRP is not intended to be adversarial to the corporate debtor but is aimed at protecting the interests of the corporate debtor; H 5 (2020) 15 SCC 1 SABARMATI GAS LIMITED v. SHAH ALLOYS LIMITED 207 [C. T. RAVIKUMAR, J.] (c) that intention of the Code is not to give a new lease of A life to debts which are time-barred; (d) that the period of limitation for an application seeking initiation of CIRP under Section 7 of the Code is governed by Article 137 of the Limitation Act and is, therefore, three years from the date when right to apply accrues; B (e) that the trigger for initiation of CIRP by a financial creditor is default on the part of the corporate debtor, that is to say, that the right to apply under the Code accrues on the date when default occurs; C (f) that default referred to in the Code is that of actual non-payment by the corporate debtor when a debt has become due and payable; and (g) that if default had occurred over three years prior to the date of filing of the application, the application would be time-barred save and except in those cases where, on facts, D the delay in filing may be condoned; and (h) an application under Section 7 of the Code is not for enforcement of mortgage liability and Article 62 of the Limitation Act does not apply to this application. E 22. The following relevant recitals from paragraphs 34, 34.1, 38 and 38.1 are worthy to be noted in the above context and they read thus:- “34……….. As noticed, in B.K. Educational Services [B.K. Educational Services (P) Ltd. v. Paras Gupta & Associates, F (2019) 11 SCC 633, it has clearly been held that the limitation period for application under Section 7 of the Code is three years as provided by Article 137 of the Limitation Act, which commences from the date of default and is extendable only by application of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, if any case for condonation of delay is made out. The findings in para G 12 in Jignesh Shah [Jignesh Shah v. Union of India, (2019) 10 SCC 750] makes it clear that the Court indeed applied the principles so stated in B.K.
