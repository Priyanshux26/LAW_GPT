The exemption specifically withdrawn in respect to “pan masala containing tobacco”, by whatever name called, by notification 20 dated January 31.01.1985 H 21 No. T.I.F.-2-595/XI-9(4)/99-U.P. Act-15-48--98 M/S TRIMURTHI FRAGRANCES (P) LTD. THR. ITS DIRECTOR SHRI 1065 PRADEEP KUMAR AGRAWAL v. GOVT. OF N.C.T. OF DELHI THR. ITS PRINCIPAL SECRETARY (FINANCE) [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] dated 26.06.1997, continued after issuance of notification dated A 06.04.1999 as well. The Allahabad High Court noted the previous High Court decisions, as well as the of this court, in Kothari Products Ltd. (supra) and held that in view of the specific provision in the APGST Act, the High Court held that gutkha (gudaku), an entry under the First Schedule to the ADE Act, was exempted from tax under the APGST B Act. The High Court further held that there was no provision corresponding to the APGST Act in the UPTT Act and that the earlier notification (of 1985), was much wider and included tobacco products like gutkha, and pan masala containing tobacco which were exempted by virtue of Section 4(1) and by not with reference to any statute like the CET Act, etc. Therefore, it was ruled that the contention that something C was included in the CET Act, would stand exempted from tax was not correct, unless the State Act contained a specific provision to that effect. Appellants’ contentions 29. Mr. Dhruv Agarwal, learned senior counsel appearing in the D Delhi cases urged that the heading of Section 7(1) of the DST Act is “Tax free goods” and it uses the phrase “-no tax shall be payable”. In view of Entry 22 of Schedule III read with Section 7(1), gutkha was “tax free goods” and as per specific mandate of Section 7(1) “no tax shall be payable under the Act” (i.e. the DST Act) on sale of goods listed under Schedule III. The clear effect of Section 7(1) read with E Entry 22 of Schedule III was that gutkha fell outside the charge or purview of the levy. 30. It was argued Section 7(2) inter alia provides that the Lt. Governor could by notification add to, or omit from, or otherwise amend Schedule III and “thereupon” it was deemed to be amended. In spite F of this power, Entry 22 of Schedule III was not amended and gutkha continued to be tax-free goods. Gutkha thus, being tax-free goods continued to fall outside the DST levy and was not liable to be included in “taxable turnover” under Section 4(2)(a)(ii) of the DST Act. Section 4(1), provides for applying the rate of tax “in the case of taxable G turnover”. When the goods were exempt there was no question of their inclusion in the taxable turnover. Learned senior counsel relied on Tata Sky Ltd. v. State of Madhya Pradesh22. Learned senior counsel submitted that the High Court’s reasoning that Entry 22 in Schedule III 22 [2013] 2 SCR 849: (2013) 2 SCC 849 H 1066 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A was general and that Entry 46 of Schedule I was specific, had no application; he cited Reliance Trading Company v. State of Kerala23.
