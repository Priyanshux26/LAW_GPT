has been issued on 05.08.2006 and B map dated 08.10.2009 and partial completion certificate on 07.05.2011. In the allotment letter/lease deed also, the land is on lease hold for 90 years, it is clearly mentioned. It is also known that the space created in the said project has been booked by the promoter in favour of different persons and institutions. At the time of booking, the developers and the buyer were certainly aware C that the said land is leasehold in nature and the investment would have been made by the investors on the above basis. Since the policy of the Department of Tourism came into existence for the first time in 2013, and theme-based malls were included in it in the year 2016. Therefore, the argument presented in point number-1 D does not seem to be justified. (2) In response to the request expressed in point no. 2 by Shri SS Bhasin, after perusing all the facts and the mandate issued by the tourism department dated 06.11.2013 and 03.05.2016, it was found that the government issued by the tourism department, E Uttar Pradesh in November 2013 and all the provisions of the amendment dated 03.05.2016 are effective only from the date of 06.11.2013. As mentioned in these provisions, assessment of land for projects for construction and operation of theme park/ amusement park/theme-based mall, selection of investor, approval of layout plan, building plan etc., is to be approved by the F government partner on the basis of the standards mentioned in the mandates, from which it is clear that in the projects completed or partially completed before the year 2013, the provisions of the said mandates will not be effective, rather, these provisions have been implemented to encourage the establishment G of such new schemes in the state. In the case in question, the proposed building map was approved by UPSIDA on 08.10.2009 as per the norms applicable for the time being. According to the above approved map by the petitioner, on the basis of construction, the first partial completion certificate was issued by UPSIDA on 07.05.2011 in respect of commercial area of 179017 sq. mts. On H the basis of further construction done by the petitioner, second BHASIN INFOTECH AND INFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATE LTD. 1079 v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [DINESH MAHESHWARI, J.] partial Completion Certificate was issued by UPSIDA on A 16.04.2015. Theme based mall was included under the scheme on 03.05.2016. From this it is clear that the planning and construction of the plot in question by the petitioner has not been done under the provisions of the above referenced mandates issued by the Tourism Department for the establishment of theme park/ B amusement park/theme-based mall. Therefore, the provisions of the said s are not effective on the plot in question. **** **** **** In the case in question, the project has been implemented by the petitioner through private investment and there is C no participation of any State Government PSU/SPV or company in the project. As per paragraph d above, a provision has been made to make the land available as free hold as per rules after the acquisition of land by the executing agency only if there is minimum 20 percent D participation of any public sector undertaking/SPV of the state government.
