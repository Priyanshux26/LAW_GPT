Shikha John, Shubham Dwivedi, Anand Singh, Ajay Kanojiya, Advs. For the Respondents. / OF THE SUPREME COURT K. V. VISWANATHAN, J. 1. These writ petitions raise questions involving the interpretation of the Offi ce Memoranda [OM] dated 19.01.2019 and 31.01.2019 prescribing the eligibility for the Economically Weaker Section [EWS] Category. Additionally, they also involve the interpretation of the Civil Services Examination Rules, 2022 [CSE-2022 Rules], particularly, Rules 13, 27 and 28 thereof.
