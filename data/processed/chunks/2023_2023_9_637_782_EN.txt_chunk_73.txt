E 196. The rule of ejusdem generis is not an inviolable rule of law.92 Where the context and mischief of the statutory enactment do not require a restricted meaning to be attached to words of general import, the court has to give the words their plain and ordinary meaning.93 Condition 23 of the MSEB Conditions of Supply is a mode of recovery of electricity arrears of the erstwhile consumer, which could be recovered even from F a successor. The MSEB, in our opinion, intended to cover all possible cases of transfer of the undertaking or premises of the erstwhile consumer, be it voluntary, on account of death of the consumer, or by operation of law. Circular 518 dated 18 June 1993 and Circular 607 dated 19 December 1998 issued by the MSEB emanated from Condition 23 of the MSEB G Conditions of Supply. They contained directions vis-à-vis power supplied to those property owners who purchased sick and closed industrial units. The context and the purpose of the statutory terms and conditions of 92 Valparaiso Kottarathil Kochuni v. States of Madras & Kerala, (1960) 3 SCR 887 93 BHEL v. Globe Hi-Fabs Ltd., (2015) 5 SCC 718 H 736 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A supply demand that a broader construction should be adopted, and there is no room for the application of the rule of ejusdem generis. 197. On our interpretation of Condition 23 of the MSEB Conditions of Supply with particular reference to subclause (b) thereof, we are of the view that the said sub-clause is applicable to involuntary transfers, B such as court auctions. 198. Applying the above considerations to the appeals our conclusions are as follows: Item 101.1: Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. Super & Stainless Hi Alloys Ltd; Civil Appeal 5312-5313 of 2005 C 199. The first respondent purchased a sick industrial unit in auction from the SICOM under Section 29 of the State Financial Corporations Act. It filed a writ petition challenging the actions of the appellant-Board in denying it a new electricity connection. A subsequent writ petition was filed by SICOM challenging the vires of Circular 607 dated 19 D December 1998. By a common dated 19 December 2002, the Bombay High Court disposed of the writ petitions and quashed the impugned Circular 607 on the ground that MSEB lacked jurisdiction as the circular was beyond the powers of the Board under Section 24 of the 1910 Act. The High Court relied on Isha Marbles (supra), to reach the conclusion that although Section 24 provides for payment of arrears E for reconnection after the supply is disconnected, it only refers to the consumer who failed to pay the dues and does not concern itself with a new owner or occupier of the premises. 200. The appellant preferred the present Special Leave Petition. This Court issued notice on 6 May 2003 and leave was granted on 25 F August 2005. By an dated 24 August 2006, the question whether electricity dues constitute a charge on the property so far as the transferor and the transferee of the unit are concerned was referred to a larger bench.
