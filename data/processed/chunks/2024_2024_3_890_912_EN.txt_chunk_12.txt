The appeal filed by the Commissioner was allowed by the CEGAT by relying upon the decision of this Court in Kesoram. This Court referred to its earlier decision in Paper Products Ltd. versus Commissioner of Central Excise, (1999) 7 SCC 84, and held that the circular dated 12.07.1989 was binding on the Department and, therefore, it was not open to the Department to prefer appeal before CEGAT contrary to what was laid down in the circular dated 12.07.1989 in which it was specifically provided that the residual Section 15(1)(c) of the Customs Act would apply to cases where the goods were removed from a warehouse after expiry of the warehousing period and that the rate of duty in such cases would be the rate prevalent on the date of payment of duty. This Court noted that the aforesaid circular dated 12.07.1989 was withdrawn by the subsequent circular dated 14.08.1997. But, at the relevant point of time, the circular dated 12.07.1989 was holding the field. Thus, the appellate passed by the Collector of Customs (Appeal) could not be said to be in anyway illegal or erroneous and, therefore, it was not open to the Department to challenge the said before the CEGAT in contravention of the circular dated 12.07.1989. 48. The decision in Kesoram was approved and applied by a coordinate bench of this Court in SBEC Sugar Ltd versus Union of India, (2011) 4 SCC 668. This Court held that Section 15(1)(b) would be applicable only when the goods are cleared from the warehouse under Section 68 of the Customs Act i.e. within the initially permitted period or during 908 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the permitted extended period. When the goods are cleared from the warehouse after expiry of the permitted period or its permitted extension, the goods are deemed to have been improperly removed under Section 72(1)(b) of the Customs Act with the consequence that the rate of duty has to be computed according to the rate applicable on the date of expiry of the permitted period under Section 61. 49. Let us now briefly recap the facts. Appellant had imported second hand steel mill machinery and parts covered by three transit bonds totalling 595 cases. The customs authority had notified an open area of 2000 square meters within the industrial/factory premises of the appellant as a public bonded warehouse. This open area was fenced and had gate with locking arrangement. The imported goods covered by the 595 cases were required to be warehoused in the said notified public bonded warehouse without payment of customs duty. Appellant had written a letter dated 30.08.1989 to the concerned Superintendent seeking permission to unload a portion of the cargo outside the warehouse but within the factory premises. It was pointed out that the trailers carrying the consignment could not enter the said warehouse as because those trailers had got stuck in the soil outside the warehouse but within the factory premises as the soil had become very sluggish due to heavy rain and also because of paucity of space within the notified open area.
