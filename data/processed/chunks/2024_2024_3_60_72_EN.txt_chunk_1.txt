20(3) of the PC&PNDT Act in public interest – Propriety: Held: The power of sub-section (3) of s.20 of PC&PNDT Act is notwithstanding the power of sub-sections (1) & (2) of s.20 – The said power can only be exercised when the appropriate authority forms an opinion that it is necessary or expedient in public interest to do so – It is incumbent upon the appropriate authority to form its opinion based on reasons expedient or necessary to exercise the power of suspension – The contents of the suspension dated 29.12.2010 does not contain reasons as required to form an opinion that it is necessitated or expedient in public interest to exercise the power of suspension –Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement of sub-section (3) of s.20 of PC&PNDT Act – Neither the first of suspension dated 25.10.2010 nor the second of suspension dated 29.12.2010 qualifies the requirement of sub-section (3) of s.20 of the PC&PNDT Act – The said view is fortified by the Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court.
