SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 19. Mrs. Rukhmini Bobde, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant in her written submissions has stated thus: - “WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 1. The present Appeal has been filed against the final judgement of the Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad a batch of First Appeals, whereby the Hon’ble High Court has allowed all the abovementioned appeals filed by the Respondent-IOCL while relying upon the dated 23.02.2018 passed in First Appeal from No. 843 of 2014 (@pg. 79 of the present Appeal) which is illegal and perverse as the Hon’ble High Court has ignored to answer the questions of law. It is submitted that the dated 23.02.2018 in First Appeal from No. 843 of 2014 was challenged by the Appellant-Union before this Hon’ble Court and the said petition bearing SLP(C) No. 3987 of 2021 was dismissed by this Hon’ble Court on 04.03.2021 on the ground that claim amount was very low. It is however submitted that the claim amount of all the batch matters herein comes to approximately Rs. 1,55,03,652/-. 2. The facts of the lead case herein are that the Respondent-IOCL had sent a legal notice dated 07.11.2005 under Section 106 of the Railway Act, 1989 to the Appellant-Union for refund of excess freight charges with respect to a consignment dated 25.08.2022, due to change in methodology, having [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1069 Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. been applied prospectively from 01.01.2005 which resulted in variation in fares and freights when compared with the then existing fares and freight. It is submitted that the present Appeal is not a case of error in the existing notified freight change. 3. The case of the Appellant-Union is that Section 106 of the Railway Act, 1989 does not apply to the present case at all since as per the circulars dated 07.04.2004 and 24.09.2004 (@page 141 and 144 of the Appeal respectively) issued by the Appellant-Union, the change in distance happened due to rationalization of the distances, aimed at ensuring uniformity in the method of deriving the distance of charging fates and freight for all customers across Indian Railways. The rationalization was also directed to be applied prospectively (from 01.01.2005 onwards) and the date of transport of consignment was on 25.08.2002 i.e. more than 2 years before application of the circular. It is further submitted that the Appellant-Union in its circular dated 07.04.2004 had specifically stated that the Appellant-Union would not be raising any issue of undercharges due to the variation nor was the Petitioner going to refund the charges collected in past cases, thus ensuring balance of convenience.
