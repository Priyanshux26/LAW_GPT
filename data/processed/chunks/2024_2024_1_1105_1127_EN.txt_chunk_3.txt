Digital Supreme Court Reports 3. Notices for eviction were subsequently sent to the tenants in each appeal and both these notices are dated 04.02.2002. So far as the notice to the respondents in Civil Appeal No. 1543 of 2016 is concerned, the delivery of vacant possession was asked for on five main grounds. The first one was default in payment of rent. The next ground was erection of a permanent structure by the tenant without permission of the landlord. The third point was subletting and it was also stated in that notice that the landlords had decided to construct a building thereon for residential purpose as also for operating a hotel. Under Section 16(1)(i) of the 1999 Act, the erection of a new building could come within “reasonable and bona fide” requirement of landlord, subject to satisfaction of certain other stipulated conditions. The municipality’s demolition notice was also cited as a ground for eviction. We shall reproduce provisions of Sections 15 and 16 of the said enactment in subsequent paragraphs of this . In the eviction notice to the respondent in Civil Appeal No. 1544 of 2016, the grounds cited were, inter-alia, issue of the demolition notice by the municipality, default in payment of rent and also necessity of the tenanted portion for construction of a new building upon demolishing the structures on the land. 4. As the eviction notices did not yield any result, the two suits were instituted on the same date, i.e. 07.08.2002. These suits appear to have had been tried simultaneously and they were decreed by the Trial Court, which was sustained by the Appellate Court. In the Civil Revision Petition, the tenants succeeded as the and decree were set aside. 5. In course of the proceeding before the Trial Court, a Commissioner was appointed. He was an architect. His opinion, however, was not accepted by the Trial Court. He had given his opinion that a portion referred to as “C” in his report was dangerous and was required to be demolished. This portion, however, was in possession of the plaintiffs only, but adjacent to the suit property (in Civil Appeal No. 1543 of 2016). Though his report dated 08.12.2008 carries the caption of suit no. (239 of 2002) 136 of 2010, the report was examined by the Trial Court in connection with both the suits. His report on the necessity of urgent demolition of the tenanted portions was not fully conclusive but his view was that the entire building was about 97 years old and life of the building was over. His opinion has been referred to and dealt with by the Trial Court in the following terms:- [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1111 Baitulla Ismail Shaikh and Anr. v.
