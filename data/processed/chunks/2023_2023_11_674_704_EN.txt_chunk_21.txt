(iii) A public authority must objectively demonstrate by placing relevant material before the court that its decision was in the public interest to frustrate a claim of legitimate expectation; (iv) The decision of the High Court of Kerala to apply a minimum cut-off to the viva voce examination is contrary to Rule 2(c)(iii) of the 1961 Rules. (v) The High Court’s decision to apply the minimum cut-off marks for the viva voce frustrates the substantive legitimate expectation of the petitioners. The decision is arbitrary and violative of Article 14. (vi) In terms of relief, we hold that it would be contrary to the public interest to direct the induction of the petitioners into the Higher Judicial Service after the lapse of more than six years. Candidates who have been selected nearly six years ago cannot be unseated. They were all qualifi ed and have been serving the district judiciary of the state. Unseating them at this stage would be contrary to public interest. To induct the petitioners would be to bring in new candidates in preference to those who are holding judicial offi ce for a length of time. To deprive the state and its citizens of the benefi t of these experienced judicial offi cers at a senior position would not be in public interest. 56. In the view which we have taken in the above terms, we have not considered it necessary to answer the broader question which has been referred to the Constitution Bench. Besides, the question has been squarely raised in certain other cases which form a part of the present batch of cases in which arguments are being heard by the Constitution Bench. 57. The Petitions are accordingly disposed of in the above terms. 58. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Petitions disposed of. Ankit Gyan
