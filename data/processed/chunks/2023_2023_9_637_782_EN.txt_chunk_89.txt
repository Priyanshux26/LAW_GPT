The respondent participated in the auction proceedings and acquired the assets of Arunesh Processors Pvt Ltd at Vapi, Gujarat. The sale was confirmed in favour of the respondent for Rs. 70 lakhs on 11 August 2005 by the Bombay High Court. Thereafter, on 12 December 2008 a deed of F conveyance was executed between the Official Liquidator, High Court of Bombay and the respondent. In 2010, the appellant filed Darkhast No. 7 of 2010 for execution of the decree passed in the suit in 2002. 259. On 16 December 2010, the respondent approached the appellant requesting it to release power supply to the plot at Vapi, Gujarat. G On 03 January 2011, the appellant informed the respondent that power supply cannot be released on the plot because Darkhast No. 7 of 2010 was pending and dues were not recovered from the previous owner. Since the respondent was in need of power supply on the said plot, it paid the outstanding dues of the previous owner to the tune of Rs. 17 lakhs on 25 February 2011. However, on 17 August 2011, the respondent H 756 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A approached the appellant to refund the paid amount. The appellant refused to refund the amount, contending that the previous owner had not yet acknowledged the receipt of their claim. The respondent instituted a writ petition before the High Court of Gujarat for challenging Clause 4.1.11 of the Gujarat Electricity Supply Code as being inconsistent with the 2003 Act. The High Court in the impugned dated 03 B December 2012 held that Clause 4.1.11 of the Conditions of Supply was ultra-vires the provisions of 2003 Act. 260. It is beyond the pale of doubt that the respondent requested the appellant to release power supply to their premises on 16 December 2010. At the relevant point of time, the amended Clause 4.1.11 was in C force. In the impugned dated 03 December 2012, the High Court held that the State Commission is not authorised to prescribe a condition under Section 50 of the 2003 Act for payment of dues of a previous owner or occupier from the new owner as a precondition to supply electricity. It was further held that Section 43 of the 2003 Act D does not impose any condition for payment of electricity dues attached to the premises before getting supply of electricity. The High Court observed that the phrase “any dues relating to that premises” conveyed that the premises were held to be a defaulter of electricity dues and charges, and was inconsistent with the provisions of the 2003 Act. On the basis of the above reasons, the High Court concluded that the first E part of Clause 4.1.11 was ultra vires the provisions of Sections 43, 50, 56, and 181 of the 2003 Act. 261. The appellant submitted that the Board is empowered to frame terms and conditions providing for recovery of electricity dues attached to the premises. It has been further contended that since the F auction was held on “as is where is basis”, the auction purchaser was required to carry out due diligence in regard to the dues owed against the property being purchased.
