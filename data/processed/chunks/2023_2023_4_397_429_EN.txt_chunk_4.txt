On account of evidence available C on record having been ignored and there being patent perversity in appreciation of evidence by the Sessions Judge it resulted in interference by the High Court. No material irregularity has crept in the of the High Court calling for interference. On re-appreciation of entire evidence by the High Court in proper perspective it has resulted in arriving at a right conclusion viz. D that accused alone committed the murder of the deceased and there being no other possible view which could be considered as missing in the link of chain of circumstances, the appeal is devoid of merits. The passed by the High Court is upheld. [Paras 21-23][428-G-H; 429-A-B, C-E] E Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra (1984) 4 SCC 116 : [1985] 1 SCR 88; Sheo Swarup v.
