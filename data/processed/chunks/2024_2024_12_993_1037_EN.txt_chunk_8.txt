31. On 28.04.1977, the OSD sent a letter to the State Government under Section 52(3) of the RUI Act for issuing notification under Section 52(1) of the RUI Act. 32. Thereafter, the State Government issued a notification under Section 52(1) of the RUI Act on 16.06.1977 and the same was published in the official gazette on 23.06.1977 showing the names of late Ram Narain, Radhey Shyam, Yogesh Chandra Goyal and Manohar Lal, being the landowners. In such circumstances, as per sub-sections (1) and (4) of Section 52, the said lands vested completely, free from all encumbrances, in the State Government. 33. The of the OSD dated 25.09.1978 passed under Section 52(3) of the RUI Act recorded that the amount of compensation could not be determined by way of a mutual agreement, therefore, a reference under Section 53(4) of the RUI Act was made to the Collector, Alwar on 26.08.1982. 34. The OSD wrote a letter dated 29.05.1982 asking the respondents to handover the vacant and peaceful possession of the Moongaska land under Section 52(5) of the RUI Act within 30 days failing which, the possession would be taken over by force under Section 52(6) of the RUI Act. On 16.07.1982, the possession of the said land was taken over by the State Government under Section 52(6) of the RUI Act. However, the respondents maintain that no actual or physical possession of the subject land was ever taken by the State Government. Further, the payment of compensation by the appellant Trust was condition precedent for transferring possession of the subject land to it, yet the same was not done in contravention of the provisions of the RUI Act. 35. On 22.07.1982, the possession was handed over to the appellant Trust by the State Government under Section 52(7) of the RUI Act. 36. By dated 17.01.1988 passed by the City Magistrate, Alwar in compliance of Section 60A of the Rajasthan Urban Improvement (Amendment) Act, 1987 (the “Amending Act, 1987”), the total amount 1006 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports towards compensation was fixed at Rs. 27,600/-. The appellant Trust was liable to pay compensation to the extent of 80% of the total compensation decided, which was to be distributed amongst Radhey Shyam, Yogesh Chandra Goyal and Manohar Lal. A notice was issued to the respondents by the City Magistrate, Alwar on 27.01.1988, to collect the 80% compensation amount by 30.01.1988. A messenger from the appellant Trust also went to the residence of the respondents on 28.01.1988 to hand over the compensation amount but the respondents declined to receive the same on the grounds that compensation for the Moongaska land was supposed to be computed in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, which was not done in the instant case and that no separate apportionment of the amount towards compensation was done for different owners. 37. The respondents challenged the legality and validity of the acquisition proceedings before the High Court in S.B. Civil Writ Petition no. 2204/1998 on the ground that since no compensation had been paid to the respondents, the acquisition proceedings stood lapsed.
