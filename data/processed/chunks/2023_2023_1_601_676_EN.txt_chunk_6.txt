In the year 1960, the Government of Punjab, in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 5 and 22 of the 1952 Act, made the Chandigarh (Sale of Sites and Building) Rules, 1960 (hereinafter referred G to as “the 1960 Rules”). Rule 14 of the 1960 Rules prohibits fragmentation or amalgamation of any site or building. The validity of Rule 14 of the 1960 Rules was challenged before the High Court of Punjab & Haryana (for short, “High Court”) in the case of Chander Parkash Malhotra v. Ved Parkash Malhotra and Others1. Vide its in the said H 1 1991 SCC OnLine P&H 245 RESIDENT’S WELFARE ASSOCIATION AND ANOTHER v. 611 THE UNION TERRITORY OF CHANDIGARH [B. R. GAVAI, J.] case, the High Court held the said Rule 14 to be ultra vires to the A Constitution of India. However, this Court, in the case of Chandigarh Administration v.
