8. It was further submitted that the notification dated 08.10.1985, as is sought to be relied upon by the appellants, will not be applicable in the case in hand. From a perusal thereof, it is evident that the exemption is only with reference to sale of land within the municipal area. In the case in hand, it is not the sale of land, rather immovable property in the form of a rolling mill, which cannot be termed to be land. The aforesaid notification has been issued in exercise of powers under Section 8(2) of the 1913 Act which enables the State Government to exclude any transaction of sale of any land or property or class of land or property for exercise of right of pre-emption. The right to the respondents flows from Section 16 of the 1913 Act which provides that right of pre-emption in respect of urban immovable property vests in the tenant. The term ‘urban immovable property’ has been defined in Section 3(3) of the 1913 Act to mean immovable property within the limits of town, other than agricultural land. 8 R.S.A. No. 2109 of 1998 9 The Limitation Act, 1963 10 Additional District Judge, Yamuna Nagar at Jagadhri 128 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Section 3(1) thereof defines any agricultural land to mean land as defined in 1900 Act11. Section 3(2) defines ‘village immovable property’ to mean immovable property within the limits of a village, other than agricultural land. 9. The expression ‘land’ is defined in 1900 Act to mean the land which is not occupied by site of any building in a town or village and is occupied or let out for agricultural purposes or for purposes subservient to agriculture. He also referred to the definition of ‘immovable property’, as provided for in Section 3(26) of the 1897 Act12. As the sale in the case in hand was pertaining to not the land situated within the municipal limits but of a constructed area which was being used a rolling mill, the exemption as granted vide notification dated 08.10.1985 will not be applicable in the case of the appellants. Very fairly, he did not dispute the proposition of law as laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Shyam Sunder and others’ case (supra). However, he submitted that the same will not be applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case as the notification does not come to the rescue of the appellants. 10. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the relevant referred record. 11.
