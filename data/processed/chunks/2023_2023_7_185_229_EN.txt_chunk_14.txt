It was clear that its purpose was to define export obligation period of specified goods. It was submitted that merely G because Appendix-4J provided for compliance of ‘pre-import condition’, that did not mean that it became the list meant for only goods on which the ‘pre-import condition’ was applicable. 23. It was argued that there was no conflict between paragraph 4.14 of the HBP and paragraph 4.13 of the FTP because paragraph 4.14 H 204 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A imposed ‘pre-import condition’ even in case of inputs not falling within the ambit of paragraph 4.13. This conclusion was drawn based on an erroneous understanding that only limited items covered under Appendix- 4J were covered by paragraph 4.13. All articles intended to be imported under AA, availing exemption from payment of IGST, were covered by the Notification No. 33 / 2015-20 dated 13.10.2017, issued in terms of B paragraph 4.13 of the FTP. By virtue of the said notification, the moment any manufacturer decided to import any item under AA availing IGST benefit, the ‘pre-import’ requirement, as enumerated under paragraph 4.14, was attracted. The notification acted as a bridge between paragraph 4.13 and 4.14 of the FTP. They were in harmony with the spirit of the C FTP. 24. The learned ASG urged that the notifications interpreted by the High Court amended the conditions for granting exemption from the levy of certain taxes. The respondent exporters had not challenged the power to impose the levies; their only argument was that the ‘pre-import’ D condition, which was introduced for the first time in the notification, was burdensome. They also contend that these conditions were contradictory and made business cumbersome. The ASG submitted that once the power to levy was undisputed, the conditions under which such levies were imposed, and the manner in which they were collected, were within the domain of the legislature or Parliament. Unless it was shown that the E statute imposed a method of collection that was capricious, or arbitrary, the courts ought not to interfere with the levy. Similarly, a levy could fail if there was no mechanism for assessment and collection. Reliance was placed on the decisions reported as Khandige Sham Bhat v Agricultural Income Tax Officer16; Assistant Commissioner of Urban Land Tax v F Buckingham & Carnatic Co Ltd.17; R.K. Garg v Union of India18; Union of India v VKC Footsteps India (P) Ltd19. It was submitted that the courts ought to be circumspect while interpreting any fiscal legislation, and not hold either the provisions or terms of exemptions, or conditions imposed by the law, or through delegated legislation, as unreasonable, or arbitrary. The learned ASG urged that being a new G legislation, the Union had to take into account divergent views and norms, and refashioning of the entire indirect tax spectrum was called for. 16 1963 (3) SCR 809. 17 1970 (1) SCR 268. 18 1981 (1) SCR 947. 19 2022 (2) SCC 603.
