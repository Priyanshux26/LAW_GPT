Headnotes Penal Code, 1860 – s. 302 and s.307 – Trial Court convicted and sentenced appellants – Relying on ocular and medical evidence – High Court confirmed the sentence and conviction – Whether the sentence and conviction falls short of standard of beyond reasonable doubt: Held: Trial court primarily relied on testimonies of PW-1 to PW-3 – PW-1 is an injured witness and a relative of D1 – PW-2 is also an injured witness and a neighbor of D1 – The evidence of an injured witness is considered to be on a higher pedestal than that of a witness simpliciter – PW-2 deposed that were about 50 persons at the scene of the crime – Then, how has the non-examination of independent witness been countenanced by the prosecution is something that escapes, or rather confounds this Court – The evidence of PW-3 appears to be fraught with contradictions – His actions not to be akin to that of a prudent man – When A-1 had allegedly broken a bottle on the head of D1, PW-3 took the injured D1 not to the hospital but to an STD booth located nearby – Why a person would “hold” a person with a grievous head injury near an STD booth and not take him to the hospital – Significant delay in recording statements of PW-1 and PW-2 – Various lapses such as these cumulatively affect the overall sanctity of the prosecution * Author 748 [2024] 3 S.C.R.

Held: The investigation officer of a case is the charioteer tasked with using the resources and personnel at his disposal to ensure law and as also that a person who has committed a crime is brought to the book – Nowhere has it come on record as to how the investigating officer (PW-22) reached the bus stand from where A-2 was arrested – who informed the authorities about A-2’s movement by bus – PW-22 made two visits to the scene of the crime and that he also examined several witnesses - how is there a striking lack of independent witnesses to lend credence to the prosecution’s version of events – He also did not conduct any scientific investigation at the spot of crime – The wound certificate for PW-1 and PW-2 was issued by Doctor, who had not been examined in the instant proceedings – Was it that the initial investigation was being managed so as to shield the real assailants, which could have been the complainant party themselves?
