The appellant did submit a reply. But it is an admitted position that the said inquiry proceedings were aborted at the initial stage itself and it was the Report of the Committee submitted earlier, that was acted upon by the EC in terms of a decision taken on 28th January 2010. We are of the opinion that when the Committee itself was unclear as to the scope of its inquiry, the appellant cannot be blamed for harbouring an H 818 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A impression that the remit of the Committee was confined to fact finding alone and it was not discharging the functions of a disciplinary committee, as contemplated under the service Rules. (d) WHIRLWIND PROCEEDINGS 62. On examining the records, it emerges that the point at which B the Committee fell into an error was when it attempted to fast forward the entire proceedings after the first few hearings and declined to grant a reasonable time to the appellant to effectively participate in the said proceedings. It is noteworthy that the proceedings of the Committee had commenced on 16th April 2009 and stood concluded on 5th June, C 2009. During this period, 18 meetings were conducted by the Committee. Following is the month-wise details of the dates on which the meetings of the Committee were conducted : (i) April 2009 – On 16th,27th and 29th (ii) May 2009 – On 6th,12th,13th,14th,19th,20th, 22nd,23rd,25th,27th,28th D and 29th (iii) June, 2009 – On 3rd,4th and 5th 63. It is also noteworthy that the time span prescribed under the CCS (CCA) Rules for concluding an inquiry is ordinarily within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the of appointment. But, E here, the entire process was wrapped up in flat 39 days. This shows the tearing hurry in which the Committee was to submit its Report. One such glaring instance of the over anxiety to conclude the proceedings is apparent from the letter dated 5th May 2009, addressed by the Committee to the appellant informing him that the next date for filing his reply and F for recording further depositions was 12th June 2009. Surprisingly, on the very next day, the Committee issued yet another letter advancing the said dates by claiming that an error had crept into the previous letter and informing the appellant that the date for filing his reply should be read as ‘12th May 2009’ and the date for recording further depositions should be read as ‘14th May, 2009’, thus moving the dates back by a whole month. G Another egregious example of the hurry and scurry shown by the Committee can be gathered from the fact that on 20th May 2009, the Committee had written to the appellant giving him a last opportunity to present himself on 20th May 2009, not only to complete his deposition, but also to cross-examine the complainants and other witnesses. H Simultaneously, the Committee forwarded six more depositions to the AURELIANO FERNANDES v. STATE OF GOA AND OTHERS 819 [HIMA KOHLI, J.]
