mtrs., was handed over to petitioner on 31.03.2009 and on 08.10.2009, the building plan for construction over the aforesaid allotted land was sanctioned by respondent No. 2 whereafter construction over an area of 179017.82 sq. mtrs. was completed by the petitioner for which, a partial completion certificate F was issued by respondent No. 2 on 07.05.2011. Until all this time, there was nothing existing as regards the policy sought to be relied upon by the petitioner. 15.2. The policy in question came up for the first time only on 06.11.2013 and it was formulated essentially for growth of tourism sector G in the State of Uttar Pradesh by setting up theme parks/amusement parks. The aforesaid policy dated 06.11.2013 laid down conditions and incentives, including exemption from stamp duty, exemption from tax on construction goods/materials imported into the State etc., which were available to the theme parks/amusement parks with minimum area of 300 acres and minimum capital investment of Rs. 500 crores. Clause 3 H 1090 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A of the said policy, of course, provided that a theme park/amusement park could be established and operated by private sector,public-private partnership or any authority by creating special purpose vehicle and in that situation all the decisions regarding assessment of the desired land, selection of the private investor and implementation of the project were to be taken by the concerned authority/government body/public B undertaking under its own rules but we are unable to find any correlation whatsoever of this stipulation of the policy with the subject land that had been given on lease to the petitioner as also with the project of the petitioner which could never be termed as any theme park or amusement park. Viewed in this light, the letter dated 31.01.2015 as sent by the C Managing Director of UPSIDC, recommending the case of the petitioner to declare its multiplex, hotel and commercial construction as tourist destination, turns out to be rather baseless and its accompanying document, stating the demand of the petitioner to convert the land in question to freehold, also appears to be wanting in logic. We shall deal with this letter dated 31.01.2015 in a little more detail hereafter. Suffice D it to observe at this juncture that the project of the petitioner cannot be correlated with this policy dated 06.11.2013, meant for theme park/ amusement park and that too with involvement of a Government body or an instrumentality of the Government in selection of the private investor as also with participation by way of investment upto 20% of the cost of E the land. 15.3. As noticed, on 16.04.2015, respondent No. 2 issued second completion certificate in respect of the project of the petitioner. Even until this point of time, there was no amendment to the policy in question. 15.4. Now, switching over to the amendment of the policy in F question by way of Office Memo dated 03.05.2016, of course, the policy to promote tourism was modified so as to grant certain other concessions and was also expanded to include theme-based mall but then, such broadening of the policy came with typical and peculiar stipulations.
