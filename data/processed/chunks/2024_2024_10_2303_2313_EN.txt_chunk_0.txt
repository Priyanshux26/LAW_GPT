Digital Supreme Court Reports the absence of any concrete material to demonstrate the nature of duties discharged by the employee, the employment s issued by the management will have to be taken into consideration and as per the same, the employee was appointed as Junior Engineer and was promoted as Assistant Engineer, on the administrative side – Even according to the employee, the nature of duties and functions discharged by him was of supervisory – As such, applying the pre-amended version of Section 2(s) and since the employee was drawing salary of more than Rs. 1,600, the employee is not a “workman” under Section 2(s) and is not covered by provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. [Para 12 to 16] Termination of employment – No violation of procedure by the management: Held: In terms of clause 14 of the appointment letter, the employee was required to be paid one month salary in lieu of notice – The employee was relieved from duty with effect from 08.10.2003 and he was issued with a cheque towards one month salary in lieu of notice – Admittedly, the employee accepted the said cheque and encashed the same – Hence, there is no violation of procedure on the part of the management in terminating the services of the employee.
