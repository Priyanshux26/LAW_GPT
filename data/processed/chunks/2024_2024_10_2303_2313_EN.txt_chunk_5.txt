But, the latter part of the section excludes four classes of employees including a person employed in a supervisory capacity drawing wages exceeding Rs.10,000/- after amendment (Rs.1,600/- before amendment) per month or exercises functions mainly of a managerial nature. In this legal backdrop, let us first examine, whether the employee falls within the definition of “workman”. 12. According to the employee, he comes within the meaning of “workman” as given in section 2(s) of the I.D. Act and the management without following the legal procedure, relieved him from service abruptly and hence, the same is illegal termination. On the other hand, it was the case of the management that the nature of the duties and functions performed by the employee was in the supervisory capacity and he was drawing a salary of above Rs.1,600/- and therefore, he does not belong to the category of “workmen”. To prove their respective claims, the employee and the Senior Manager of the management were examined as W.W.1 and M.W.1; and Exts.W1 to W5 and Exts.A to D were marked before the Labour Court. 13. Evidently, the employee was appointed as Junior Engineer (E&C) with effect from 07.06.1997 under Group 3 (Admn) with a salary of Rs.4761.75 per month. Clause 14 of the appointment issued by the management makes it clear that after confirmation of the job, the termination of service will be by one month’s notice or one month’s salary in lieu of notice by either side. It is not in dispute that the posting of the employee in the cadre of Junior Engineer was 13 Substituted by Act 24 of 2010, S.2, for “one thousand six hundred rupees” (w.e.f 15-09-2010) [2024] 10 S.C.R. 2311 Lenin Kumar Ray v. M/s Express Publications (Madurai) Ltd. confirmed with effect from 07.06.1998 vide letter dated 13.07.1998. As per the letter dated 25.05.2000 of the management, the employee was promoted as Assistant Engineer (E&C) in Group 2A (Admn) with effect from 01.05.2000 and his revised salary was Rs.6008.79 per month. The services of the employee as Assistant Engineer were confirmed with effect from 01.05.2001 vide letter dated 30.04.2001 and it was categorically stated in the said letter that all other terms and conditions mentioned in the appointment dated 07.06.1997 shall continue to hold good. Vide letter dated 08.10.2003, it was informed that the services of the employee were no longer required by the management and hence, he was relieved from duty forthwith. 14. During the course of examination, the employee deposed as W.W.1 that he was not an executive cadre employee and there were senior officers to supervise and control his work. But, in the cross- examination, he asserted that he was supervising the work of two juniors who were working under him. According to M.W.1- Senior Manager of the management, the employee was an executive of the management and the management appointed two Junior Engineers and their works were being supervised by the said employee. 15. The law is well settled that the determinative factor for “workman” covered under section 2(s) of the I.D.
