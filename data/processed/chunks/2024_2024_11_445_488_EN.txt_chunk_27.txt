The appellant contends that since the promise was duly complied with, there was no need to enforce the promise. This is also an argument which cuts at the root of appellants main submission. The notifications constituting change in law happened on 11.12.2009 and 14.12.2009 and hence there is no basis in the contention that on 01.10.2009 the old legal regime had given way. 66. The s cited by learned Senior Counsel for the appellant also do not in any manner support the case of the appellant. In GMR Warora Energy Limited vs. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission [CERC] and Others (2023) 10 SCC 401, this Court found that busy season surcharge, development surcharge, and port congestion surcharge were increased by circular/notifications issued by the Ministry of Railways by virtue of the powers vested in them which were enforceable commands proprio vigore. Similarly, the letters carrying the decisions of Coal India on the aspect of charges for linkage coal and the direction to use beneficiated coal were held to be statutory documents having the force of law. The press release 486 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of 01.10.2009 does not enjoy the same legal characteristics for the reasons already set out hereinabove. 67. Equally, for the same reason, the in Energy Watchdog vs. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and Others (2017) 14 SCC 80 will also not help the appellant. The appellant’s main reliance has been on Lloyd Electric and Engineering Limited vs. State of Himachal Pradesh and Others (2016) 1 SCC 560. In Lloyd Electric (supra), the appellant therein was already enjoying the concessional rate in CST @ 1% up to 31.03.2009. Not only this, after the Cabinet note, a policy decision was taken to extend the period of concession up to 31.03.2013 or till CST was phased out. The Department of Industries had issued a notification extending concessions from 01.04.2009 to 31.03.2013 or till the time CST is phased out. The dispute arose because the Excise and Taxation Department issued a notification of 18.06.2009 granting benefit with immediate effect for the period ending 31.03.2013. It was in that context that this Court held that the State Government cannot speak in two voices and gave effect to the notification of the Industries Department so as to maintain continuity in exemption from 01.04.2009 and set aside the of the High Court which denied exemption from 01.04.2009 till 18.06.2009 which was the date on which the Excise Department issued the notification. Unlike in Lloyd Electric (supra), in this case, there is only one voice of the government which has given the customs duty exemption for goods imported for use in thermal power plants, (without the requirement of the plant being an interstate power plant) with effect from 11.12.2009. The policy document also came on 14.12.2009. The press release of 01.10.2009 could not have been the basis for the appellant to have assumed that the notification of 01.03.2002 would stand amended and they would have the benefit from 01.10.2009 itself. 68. In Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited and Another vs. Adani Power (Mundra) Limited and Another (2023) 7 SCC 623, this Court held that the communication of 19.06.2013 in that case effected a modification to the mutual Fuel Supply Agreement and by force of the communication, transfer of coal, which was not allowed till then, was allowed between power plants.
