The first and settled circumstance is that, when a divorced Muslim woman initially moves a petition under Section 125 of CrPC 1973 and seeks an for maintenance as against her former husband and only after receiving said entitlements, she chooses to exercise her substantial rights as provided under Section 3 of the 1986 Act, and therein, the husband is also able to fulfil his concerned obligations to the appropriate satisfaction of the court, ensuring her future maintenance. It is then and only then that the husband can invoke and press his claim under Section 127(3)(b) of CrPC 1973 to seek cancellation of an , if so, passed under Section 125 of CrPC 1973, directing him to provide maintenance to his former wife. 35. In a case where a husband has fulfilled his obligations under Section 3 of the 1986 Act or as provided by customary or personal law so followed, and the divorced Muslim woman subsequently prefers to invoke Section 125 of CrPC 1973 on the ground of inability to maintain herself, in such a factual matrix, undeniably, the right to move under this provision is open in favour of a divorced Muslim woman. When a husband opposes resort to Section 125 CrPC 1973, he has to establish that, (a) initial obligations under the customary and/or personal statutory enactments as detailed earlier stands fulfilled [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1273 Mohd. Abdul Samad v. The State of Telangana & Anr. by him, and (b) that the wife, in the light of this, is able to maintain herself. However, if the husband fails to sustain the said objection(s) raised during the proceedings initiated under Section 125 of CrPC 1973, and an is accordingly passed, it would not be inherently barred or liable to be cancelled through an application under Section 127(3)(b) of CrPC 1973. Nevertheless, other appropriate remedies as provided under the CrPC 1973 or any other law to that effect, shall always be open to be exercised by such a husband to seek setting aside or appropriate modification of an so passed under Section 125 of CrPC 1973. 36. Having said that, undoubtedly, if a “reasonable substitute” has been provided for by the husband as per their personal or customary laws at the time of their divorce, the maintenance provided for by a Magistrate or a Family Court, as the case may be, under Section 125 of CrPC 1973, can be reduced to the extent of deemed double benefit being given to a divorced wife. 37. From the aforementioned, we are inclined to conclude that equivalent rights of maintenance ascertained under both, the secular provision of Section 125 of CrPC 1973, and the personal law provision of Section 3 of the 1986 Act, parallelly exist in their distinct domains and jurisprudence. Thereby, leading to their harmonious construction and continued existence of the right to seek maintenance for a divorced Muslim woman under the provisions of CrPC 1973 despite the enactment of the 1986 Act. 38. Accordingly, the decisions, as rendered by various High Courts, one of which has been referred as aforesaid, or even otherwise, and stand in contradistinction to the observations made hereinabove, do not lay down the correct position of law, are, therefore, bad in law.
