Ordinarily, an application for recall of an is maintainable on limited grounds, inter alia, where (a) the is without jurisdiction; (b) the party aggrieved with the is not served with notice of the proceedings in which the under recall has been passed; and (c) the has been obtained by misrepresentation of facts or by playing fraud upon the Court /Tribunal resulting in gross failure of justice. [2024] 2 S.C.R. 285 Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority v. Prabhjit Singh Soni & Anr. 51. In the case on hand, the recall application was filed by claiming that,- (a) the appellant was not informed of the meetings of the COC; (b) the proceedings up to the stage of approval of the resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority were ex parte; (c) the RP misrepresented that the appellant had submitted no claim when, otherwise, a claim was submitted of an amount higher than what was shown outstanding towards the appellant; and (d) there was gross mistake on part of the Adjudicating Authority in approving the plan which did not fulfil the conditions laid down in sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the IBC. 52. In our view, the grounds taken qualify as valid grounds on which a recall of the of approval dated 04.08.2020 could be sought. We thus hold that the recall application was maintainable notwithstanding that an appeal lay before the NCLAT against the of approval passed by the Adjudicating Authority. The Recall Application was not barred by time. 53. As regards the plea that the recall application was barred by time, suffice it to say that I.A. No.344/ 2021 was filed on 6.10.2020 upon getting information on 24.09.2020 from the monitoring agency regarding approval of the plan. Likewise, I.A. No.1380/ 2021 was filed on 15.03.2021 immediately when suspension of the period of limitation for any suit, appeal, application or proceeding, between 15.03.2020 and 14.03.2021, was lifted in terms of this Court’s dated 8.03.2021 in RE: Cognizance For Extension of Limitation (supra). We, therefore, find no substance in the plea that the applications were barred by limitation. The Resolution Plan did not meet the requirements of Section 30 (2) of the IBC read with Regulations 37 and 38 of the CIRP Regulations, 2016 54. In our view the resolution plan did not meet the requirements of Section 30(2) of the IBC read with Regulations 37 and 38 of the CIRP Regulations, 2016 for the following reasons: a. The resolution plan disclosed that the appellant did not submit its claim, when the unrebutted case of the appellant had been that it had submitted its claim with proof on 30.01.2020 for a sum of Rs.43,40,31,951/- No doubt, the record indicates that the appellant was advised to submit its claim in Form B (meant 286 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports for operational creditor) in place of Form C (meant of financial creditor). But, assuming the appellant did not heed the advice, once the claim was submitted with proof, it could not have been overlooked merely because it was in a different Form.
