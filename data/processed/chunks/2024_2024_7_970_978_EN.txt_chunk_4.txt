On the other hand if any Government subsequent to Rules, whatever the government and Rules are applicable to the City Manager Cadre Post.

Supplant by any material information by means of executive without tinkering the original rule could be issued however, in the present, case executive is dated 16.07.2007 on the other hand Rules is of the year 2014 there cannot be a supplant of Government dated 16.07.2007 to Rules, 2014. In the light of these facts and circumstances, the appellant have not made out a case so as to interfere with the of the learned Single Judge….” 14. Aggrieved by the impugned and dated 20.12.2022 (Corrected on 23.02.2023), Appellants have approached this Court by filing the present appeals. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 977 Bihar Staff Selection Commission & Anr. v. Himal Kumari & Anr. Etc. 15. Upon thoroughly examining all the records and arguments presented, we find that the impugned is justified and correct. The warrants no interference. The Division Bench has rightly confirmed the passed by the Ld. Single Judge. 16. A conjoint reading of the Rules, 2014 in particular rules 5 and 11, with the advertisement and giving it a pragmatic and harmonious construction, what emerges is that 32% in the written examination would make a candidate eligible and qualified to be placed in the consideration zone. However, the merit list would be prepared after taking into consideration the marks obtained on account of experience. Thus, a candidate similar to respondent no.1 would be eligible to be considered for appointment having scored 32% marks (22.5 marks out of 70) in the written examination even though having no experience. Whereas another candidate who has scored 32% marks in the written with three years experience will have scored a total of 22.5 plus 30 a total of 52.5 marks out of 100. Such a candidate will stand much higher in the merit list. The candidate with just qualifying 32% marks in the written (22.5 out of 70) with no experience will stand almost at the bottom of the merit list, but still she will be eligible and qualified to be appointed provided the merit list goes as low as 22.5 marks out of 100. Another example may be referred where a candidate has three years of experience (30 marks) but scores only seven marks out of 70 in the written test (10% marks in the written test) even though the total obtained would be 37 marks but would not be eligible or qualified to be considered as the minimum required marks in the written test i.e. 32% has not been obtained by the said candidate. 17. The required minimum qualifying marks are concerned with marks obtained in the written test only, as is evident from the Rules 2014 as also the advertisement, and it has no relevance so far as for the final preparation of the merit list.
