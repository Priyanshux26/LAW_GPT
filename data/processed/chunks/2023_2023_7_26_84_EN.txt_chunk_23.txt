Notably, this Court has already accepted this recommendation by dated 27.07.2022.21 This has been confirmed in dated 05.04.2023. As the recommendation of the SNJPC is only to bring the pay structure in conformity with the 7th Central Pay G Commission, there cannot be any objection on these recommendations. Thus, it is directed that the pay structure of the Judicial Officers be modified suitably, reflecting the recommendations suggested by the SNJPC. 20 All India Judges’ Assn. (II) v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 288 at para 19 and 20. H 21 dated 27.07.2022 in WP(C) No.643/2015 at para 17. 60 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A III. Multiplier of 2.81 and Its Uniform Application (Recommendations 44.4-44.6) 47. The Multiplier/Index of Rationalization of 2.81 has been suggested by the SNJPC to be applied to all cadres of judicial officers. The objection of the States and the Union is that the IoR of 2.81 has not B been suggested by the 7th CPC to all cadres of officers. It is their say that when the Central Pay Commission adopted a graduated fitment factor ranging from 2.57 for entry level officers to 2.81 for officers of the level of Secretary to the Government of India, the judicial officers could not have been granted a uniform multiplier/IoR of 2.81. C 48. Their submission is erroneous because, as stated above, the pay of judicial officers is to be increased commensurate to the pay of the Judges of High Courts. When the judges of the High Courts were granted a multiplier of 2.81, the judicial officers were also to be granted the same multiplier. This has been the precedent set by the previous Judicial Pay Commissions and endorsed by this Court repeatedly.22 D 49. At the cost of repetition, it may be stated that this Court has already rejected the objections of the States and the Union and consequently accepted the multiplier/Index of Rationalization of 2.81 in dated 27.07.202223 and dated 05.04.202324. As stated above, the principled basis of the acceptance is that the pay of judicial officers E in the District Judiciary can only be based on the pay of Judges of the High Court. This is because the Judiciary is independent from the Executive and as such, all aspects including pay cannot be based on the pay granted to the officers of the Executive Wing. 50. It is thus reiterated that the recommendation that the multiplier/ F index of rationalization as suggested by the SNJPC be accepted. Consequently, it is directed that the pay of the judicial officers be increased as per the Table-I annexed to the dated 27.07.2022. IV. Increments (Recommendation 44.7, 44.11) 51. The SNJPC did not recommend any change in the existing G system of accrual of increment once a year as per the date of appointment 22See Para 15.50 of FNJPC report and Para 4.8 of the Padmanabhan Commission Report.
