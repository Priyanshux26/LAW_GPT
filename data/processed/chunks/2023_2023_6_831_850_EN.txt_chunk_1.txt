[Para 20][838-B-D] 2. Merely by the appellants sending a Legal Notice on 06.11.2020, calling upon the respondent no.1 to come and collect the rent would not, ipso facto, discharge their onus, in law, to pay. D The appellants could not have called upon the respondents via a Legal Notice to come and collect the rent as, simply stated, they were obliged in law, having not assailed the dated 04.02.2019, to pay and, if for any reason the respondent no.1, either due to non-availability or resistance/refusal to receive/ accept the same, the dated 04.02.2019 had clearly provided E that either 31½ bags of paddy or the amount equivalent thereto could easily have been deposited before the Revenue Court; as ultimately is stated to have been done by the appellants, though belatedly, on 18.02.2021. 22. [Para 21][838-D-F] 3. The contention of the counsel for the appellants that F Sections 3 & 4 of the Act would come to their rescue is, in view of this Court, erroneous, for the reason that as per Section 3 of the Act, late payment of the rent as per the direction of the Revenue Court is clearly a valid ground for effecting eviction. Likewise, Section 4 of the Act provides for restoration of G possession only in limited cases and that too when the default is of only one year of lease amount to be paid; whereas in the present case, the default was for three Fasli years.
