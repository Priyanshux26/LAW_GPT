Before something amounts to an of the State Government two things are necessary. The has to be expressed in the name of the Governor as required by clause (1) of Article 166 and then it has to be communicated. As already indicated, no formal modifying the decision of the Revenue Secretary was ever made. Until such an is drawn up the H 1080 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A State Government cannot, in our opinion, be regarded as bound by what was stated in the file. As long as the matter rested with him the Revenue Minister could well score out his remarks or minutes on the file and write fresh ones. x x x B 11. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the remarks or the of the Revenue Minister, PEPSU are of no avail to the appellant.” 15. This Court in Municipal Committee v. Jai Narayan & Co., 2022 SCC OnLine SC 376 held that a noting recorded in the file is merely a noting simpliciter and nothing more. It merely represents C expression of an opinion by the particular individual. It was held as under: “16. This Court in a reported as State of Uttaranchal v. Sunil Kumar Vaish, (2011) 8 SCC 670 held that a noting recorded in the file is merely a noting simpliciter D and nothing more. It merely represents expression of opinion by the particular individual. By no stretch of imagination, such noting can be treated as a decision of the Government. It was held as under: “24. A noting recorded in the file is merely a noting simpliciter E and nothing more. It merely represents expression of opinion by the particular individual. By no stretch of imagination, such noting can be treated as a decision of the Government. Even if the competent authority records its opinion in the file on the merits of the matter under consideration, the same cannot be termed as a decision of the Government F unless it is sanctified and acted upon by issuing an in accordance with Articles 77(1) and (2) or Articles 166(1) and (2). The noting in the file or even a decision gets culminated into an affecting right of the parties only when it is expressed in the name of the President or the G Governor, as the case may be, and authenticated in the manner provided in Article 77(2) or Article 166(2). A noting or even a decision recorded in the file can always be reviewed/reversed/overruled or overturned and the court cannot take cognizance of the earlier noting or decision for exercise of the power of judicial review.
