Reliance was also placed on Sutton Et Al. v. United Air Lines, Inc.14 where the claimants had possessed poor visual acuity (20/200 on one eye and 20/400 in another eye). The appellants had sought employment as commercial airlines pilots which were declined based upon federal aviation administration certifi cation qualifi cations. The standard prescribed was a vision of 20/100. The US Supreme Court, upon an interpretation of the term “disability” under the relevant law15 held that it was a condition which was a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the life activities of such individual, was held that the claim was not established. The Court held that: “To be substantially limited in the major life activity of working, then, one must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular job of choice. If jobs utilizing an individual’s skills (but perhaps not his or her unique talents) are available, one 11 SCA No.8611/2020, decided on 08.02.2022. 12 SCA 2916/2022, decided on 11.02.2022. 13 C/LPA 331/2022, decided on 23.09.2022. 14 527 US 471 (1999). 15 42 U. S. C. § 12102(2)(A). 932 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs. Similarly, if a host of diff erent types of jobs are available, one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.” 11. TANGEDCO, in its additional affidavit states that its Chief Engineer (Personnel), by her additional affi davit disclosed its stated position that appellant’s colour blindness came to light before he was permitted to join duties and further that: “6. I humbly state that the Petitioner applied for the post of Assistant Engineer and the same is a technical position which will involve cables and other gadgets having colour coding. I state that being so it is extremely essential to be aware of the colours, lack of which, would result in risk to the petitioner’s own safety and that of the general public and also the equipments installed for Generation and Distribution of supply to the public. 7. I humbly submit that the Assistant Engineers/Electrical (Trainee) has to work both in the fi eld and in the offi ces to complete their training period. An Assistant Engineer cannot be utilized completely for offi ce works for almost ten years or more and thereafter in the promoted post of Assistant Executive Engineer also. The colour defectiveness will certainly impair the petitioner’s ability to perform the duties and responsibilities of Assistant Engineer/Electrical (Trainee). The petitioner herein with the qualifi cation of a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and having colour defectiveness cannot be considered to be accommodated in the same post i.e. Assistant Engineer/Electrical (Trainee) in TANGEDCO.” 12. During the course of hearing, Mr. Mehmood Umar Faruqui, an AOR who was present in the courtroom off ered his assistance. He had collected considerable case laws and literature on this subject. The court expresses its gratitude for his valuable contribution and eff orts.
