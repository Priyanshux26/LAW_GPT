F Allowing the appeals, the Court HELD: 1. The of the Special Court convicting the appellants for various offences under the Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and the of the High Court confirming the same are set aside. [Para 139][72-H; 73-A] G 2.1 A-1 to A-4, being officers of a company were ‘public servants’ within the definition of the said expression under Section 21 of the IPC and under Section 2(c)(iii) of the PC Act. Therefore, there is a requirement of previous sanction both under Section H A. SRINIVASULU v. THE STATE REP. BY THE INSPECTOR OF 13 POLICE 197(1) of the Code and under Section 19(1) of the PC Act, for A prosecuting A-1 to A-4 for the offences punishable under the IPC and the PC Act. [Para 29][35-F, G] 2.2 Until the amendment to the PC Act under the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 (Act 16 of 2018), with effect from 26.07.2018, the requirement of a previous sanction under B Section 19(1)(a) was confined only to a person “who is employed”. On the contrary, Section 197(1) made the requirement of previous sanction necessary, both in respect of “any person who is” and in respect of “any person who was” employed. By the amendment under Act 16 of 2018, Section 19(1)(a) of the PC Act was suitably C amended so that previous sanction became necessary even in respect of a person who “was employed at the time of commission of the offence”. [Para 30][35-M; 36-A-B] 2.3 The case on hand arose before the coming into force of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 (Act 16 of D 2018). Therefore, no previous sanction under Section 19(1) of the PC Act was necessary insofar as A-1 was concerned, as he had retired by the time a final report was filed in the year 2002. But previous sanction under Section 19(1) of the PC Act was required in respect of A-3 and A-4, as they were in service at the time of the Special Court taking cognizance. Therefore, the E Agency sought sanction, but the Management of PSU refused to grant sanction not once but twice, insofar as A-3 and A-4 are concerned. It is by a quirk of fate or the unfortunate circumstances of having been born at a time (and consequently retiring at a particular time) that the benevolence derived by A-3 and A-4 F from their employer, was not available to A-1. The refusal to grant sanction for prosecution in respect of A-3 and A-4 may not have a direct bearing upon the prosecution of A-1. But it would certainly provide the context in which the culpability of A-1 for the offences both under the IPC and under the PC Act has to be determined. [Paras 31, 32, 34][36-C-E, H; 37-A] G 2.4 The existing policy shows that A-1 at least had an arguable case, in defence of the decision he took to go in for Restricted Tender. Once this is clear, his act, even if alleged to H 14 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R.
