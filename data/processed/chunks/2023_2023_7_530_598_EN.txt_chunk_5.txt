[Para 60][579-H; 580-A-E] 7. Bitumen may be found in small quantities or large quantities. If the ‘article’ is to be found ‘valuable’, then in small quantity it must not just have some value but it must be ‘worth a good price’ or ‘worth a great deal of money’ and not that it has D ‘value’. Section 69A would then stand attracted. But if to treat it as ‘valuable article’, it requires ownership in large quantity, in the sense that by multiplying the value in large quantity, a ‘good price’ or ‘great deal of money’ is arrived at then it would not be valuable article. This Court would conclude that ‘bitumen’ as such cannot be treated as a ‘valuable article’. [Para 79][590-D-E] E Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. v. A.
