A on their fraudulent conduct and the abdication of their function; (ii)Section 140(5) is not a provision to merely induce/effect a change of an auditor who is not resigning. It is intended as a provision which involves a substantive determination of fraud so as to isolate or remove an auditor from the company and from any company that he/she is auditing. If construed to be a provision only to induce a change of a recalcitrant B auditor, the words conferring power on the NCLT to inquire into an auditor’s fraudulent conduct would be rendered meaningless; (iii) the secondproviso to Section 140(5) of the Act is essentially remedial and preventive, though it might incidentally also have a punitive effect. The public purpose / object of the second proviso to Section is clearly to C protect companies from being prejudicially affected, by debarring such an auditor, who has been held to have acted fraudulently, from being appointed as an auditor of any company. 3.20 It is submitted that in the facts of the present case, it is pertinent to note that: D a) Deloitte was the statutory auditor of IFIN from 2008 till 2018. Deloitte retired by efflux of time in 2018; b) BSR was appointed as the joint statutory auditor in 2017; c) both Deloitte and BSR jointly conducted the statutory audit of IFIN for the Financial Year 2017-2018; E d) the Petitioner i.e., the Union of India filed the Petition under Section 140(5) of the Act against both BSR and Deloitte on June 1, 2019. BSR was the statutory auditor at that time. e) this Petition is based on the SFIO IFIN Report which alleges F that both auditors i.e., Deloitte and BSR acted in a fraudulent manner. This includes the period when Deloitte was the sole auditor and for the year when the audit was jointly performed by BSR; f) after the Petition was filed, BSR tendered its resignation G and filed an application in or about July 2019 challenging the maintainability of the Union of India’s Petition under Section 140(5) of the Act. Deloitte who had retired in 2018 also filed maintainability application; and g) after leave from the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the Union of H India invoked the Hon’ble NCLT’s powers under the first UNION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER V. DELOITTE HASKINS 981 AND SELLS LLP [M. R. SHAH, J.] proviso to Section 140(5) of the Act and an auditor was A appointed for IFIN. 3.21 It is submitted that therefore in the facts and circumstances of the present case and on true interpretation of Section 140(5) of the Act, explained above, the High Court has erroneously quashed the NCLT’s upholding the maintainability of Union of India’s petition B under Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 and the proceedings under Section 140(5) of the Act, 2013 against the auditors – BSR. 3.22 Given the interpretation of Section 140(5) of the Act submitted above, it is contended that the act of resignation of BSR after the filing of the Petition under Section 140(5) of the Act cannot be held to render C the proceedings under Section 140(5) of the Act as void.
