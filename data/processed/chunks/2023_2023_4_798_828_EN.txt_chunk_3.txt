So far as the present petition is concerned, there is no averment made as to how there was non-compliance with provisions of the Constitution or of RP Act or of the Rules or G made thereunder and as to how such non-compliance had materially affected the result of the election, so as to attract the ground under Section 100(1)(d)(iv) of the RP Act, for declaring the election to be void. The omission to state such vital and basic facts has rendered the petition liable to be dismissed under H 802 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A VII, Rule 11(a) CPC read with Section 83(i)(a) of the RP Act, 1951. Election petition filed by the respondent-election petitioner is dismissed. [Paras 33, 34][827-F-H; 828-A-F] N.P.
