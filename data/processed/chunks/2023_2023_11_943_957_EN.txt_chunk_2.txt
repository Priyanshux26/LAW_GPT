2. Seats available for Sponsored & Foreign National The list of INI-wise and Specialty-wise available seats for Sponsored & Foreign Nationals will be accessible through Seats Available Tab on or before starting of “completion of application” as per mentioned in the “Important dates Tab”. 4. The petitioner’s application listed her as the OCI candidate, and she appeared in the examination in that capacity; the results declared on 13.05.2023 showed that she had secured 96.73 percentile, and her overall rank was 1902. It is asserted that this list also recognized her in OCI category. Her roll number was mentioned in the provisionally qualifi ed list of candidates published on 13.05.2023. 5. The communication dated 25.05.20231 provided information for the fi rst and second round of online seat allocation by institution and subject wise. The AIIMS issued a schedule for online seat allocation for admission to PG courses (Notice No. 97/2023) on 10.06.2023. On the same day, the petitioner was informed that she would be treated as a Foreign National as 1 No. F. AIIMS/EXAM.SEC. /4-5/(INI-CET-PG-June-2023)/2023. PALLAVI vs. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 947 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] she had disclosed her status to be as OCI Candidate2. She was informed that the mock round of application process had begun on 11.06.2023 and would end on 13.06.2023. 6. On 15.06.2023, the result of online mock round was announced. The petitioner was allotted the ‘pediatrics’ discipline in AIIMS. This is evident from the announcement of online mock seat allocation before the fi rst round published on 15.06.2023. In light of these developments, suddenly on 19.06.2023, she was informed that, she would no longer be treated as OCI candidate, but would be considered in the category of “Indian National”. This was published by virtue of a public notice No. 119/2023; an e-mail communication was received by the petitioner to that eff ect on 19.06.2023 itself. 7. As the fi rst-round of counselling was about to commence on 23.06.2023, the petitioner was informed and alleges that she had no choice but to opt for status of an Indian National which she did, under protest and participated in the fi rst counselling round. Therefore, she approached this Court immediately thereafter, on 21.06.2023, contending that despite completion of entire process and there being no error or mistake on her part, the change of her status had reduced the chances of her securing admission in the PG Medical Course considerably. It is contended by her that the change of status presumably on the basis of a Central Government notifi cation dated 04.03.2021 is unfair given that she has in all senses of the term burnt or foreclosed her options. 8. It is contended that for all practical purposes, from the year 2005 and especially her higher education trajectory made her eligible for admission as a foreign national having an OCI card. The apparent decision of AIIMS to treat the petitioner as Indian national is unfair and arbitrary. 9. It is contended by Mr. Vinay Navare, Ld. Senior Counsel, on behalf of the petitioner that the basis for this change of stand appears to be the Ministry of Home Aff airs Notifi cation dated 04.03.20213, under the head (Parity with Non-Resident Indians in the matter of admission to NEET) 2 (The eligibility criteria for candidates holding OCI Card was dated 10.06.2023).
