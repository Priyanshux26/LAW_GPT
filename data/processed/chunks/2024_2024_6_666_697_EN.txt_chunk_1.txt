4.10.2023 – The remand recorded that the copy of the remand application was sent to the Advocate engaged by the appellant through WhatsApp – These lines give a clear indication of subsequent insertion – The of remand had already been passed at 6:00 a.m. and hence, the subsequent opportunity of hearing, if any, provided to the counsel was nothing but an exercise in futility – The copy of the remand application in the purported exercise of communication of the grounds of arrest in writing was not provided to the appellant or his counsel before passing of the of remand dtd. 4.10.2023 which vitiated his arrest and subsequent remand – Arrest of the appellant followed by remand dtd. 4.10.2023 and the impugned passed by the High Court are invalid and are quashed and set aside – Appellant entitled to be released from custody by applying the ratio in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India and Others [2023] 12 SCR 714. [Paras 30, 33, 34, 36, 39, 50, 51] 668 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 – s.43B(1) – Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.19(1) – Constitution of India – Article 22(1) – Appellant placed reliance on the in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India and Others [2023] 12 SCR 714 to contend that in the said case s.19(1) of PMLA which is pari materia to s.43B(1) of the UAPA was interpreted and it was held that if the initial arrest is not in conformity with law, mere passing of successive remand s would not be sufficient to validate the same: Held: There is no significant difference in the language employed in Section 19(1) of the PMLA and Section 43B(1) of the UAPA – The provision regarding the communication of the grounds of arrest to a person arrested contained in Section 43B(1) of the UAPA is verbatim the same as that in Section 19(1) of the PMLA – The contention advanced by the respondent that there are some variations in the overall provisions contained in Section 19 of the PMLA and Section 43A and 43B of the UAPA would not have any impact on the statutory mandate requiring the arresting officer to inform the grounds of arrest to the person arrested under Section 43B(1) of the UAPA at the earliest because, the requirement to communicate the grounds of arrest is the same in both the statutes – Both the provisions find their source in the constitutional safeguard provided under Article 22(1) of the Constitution – Hence, applying the golden rules of interpretation, the provisions which lay down a very important constitutional safeguard to a person arrested on charges of committing an offence either under the PMLA or under the UAPA, have to be uniformly construed and applied – The interpretation of statutory mandate laid down in Pankaj Bansal on the aspect of informing the arrested person the grounds of arrest in writing has to be applied pari passu to a person arrested in a case registered under the provisions of the UAPA.
