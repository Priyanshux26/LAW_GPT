But then, it is a fact that the legal representatives of deceased defendant Nos.3 and 5 have not chosen to contest the matter in the present proceedings despite being served. Above all, it is an indisputable fact that the 5th defendant had earlier attempted to bring in a case by way of amendment (though ultimately 155 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. failed to prove) that the Will in question dated 10.11.1992 was subsequently revoked by the testatrix on 20.11.1992 as per Ext.D5. Two aspects turn out of it. Firstly, his admission to the fact that the subject Will dated 10.11.1992 was actually executed by the testatrix and she was fully aware of its contents. We may hasten to add that though the 5th defendant had produced Ext.D5 on 08.06.1999, both the trial Court and the High Court returned findings against the 5th defendant. 14. Now, going by the evidence on record, the testatrix was admitted in Jaslok Hospital, Bombay on 11.11.1992 only for knee replacement surgery to alleviate the affliction due to arthritis. Evidence on record would reveal that the testatrix underwent blood transfusion for three days, that thereafter underwent surgery and her condition became critical and that she remained in the said hospital for 53 days till her death on 08.01.1993. Despite such position if the 5th defendant takes a stand that she was in a sound disposition of mind on 20.11.1992 to execute Ext.D5, how would he be justified in raising a case that the testatrix was not in a sound disposition of mind prior to her hospitalization in Jaslok Hospital, Bombay i.e., on 10.11.1992. In view of his case attempted to be brought in through Ext.D5 the 5th respondent could not have raised the contention that the testatrix was not in sound disposition of mind. This is the second aspect turning out of Ext.D5. We adverted to the aforesaid aspects revealed from evidence solely to show the hollowness of the case of the 5th defendant that Ext.P2 – Will dated 10.11.1992 was not executed with sound disposition. Anyway, the legal representatives of deceased defendant No.5 who alone disputed the execution of Ext.P2 Will, are not contesting the matter. The upshot of the discussion is that the contesting respondent Nos.2 and 3 viz., defendant Nos.1 and 6 in the suit cannot be permitted to dispute the execution of the Will dated 10.11.1992 and that they can be permitted to urge only for sustaining the impugned . 15. Now, we will refer to the cited suspicious circumstances. In the light of the decision in Gurdial Kaur & Ors. v. Kartar Kaur & Ors.2 there can be no doubt with respect to the position that when suspicious circumstances exist about the valid execution of a Will, it is the duty of 2 (1998) 4 SCC 384 DEREK A C LOBO & ORS. v. 1555 ULRIC M A LOBO (DEAD) BY LRS. & ORS. the person seeking declaration about the validity of the Will to dispel such suspicious circumstances.
