In to do so it is legitimate to take into consideration all the factors such as history of the legislation, G the purpose thereof, the surrounding circumstances and conditions, the mischief which it intended to suppress, the remedy for the disease which the legislature resolved to cure and the true reason for the remedy….’ H 566 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R.
