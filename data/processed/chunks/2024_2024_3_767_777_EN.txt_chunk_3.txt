2.8 Insofar as R. Harshinder (accused No.5) is concerned, he had preferred Criminal Appeal No.244 of 2022. His appeal was also partly allowed by reducing the sentence to the period already undergone by him, vide dated 15th February 2022. 2.9 After the aforesaid appeals were decided, the appellant herein has preferred the present appeal in October, 2023. Leave was granted in this matter on 13.02.2024. 3. We have heard Ms. Neha Kapoor, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. Rajan Kumar Chourasia, learned counsel for the respondent. 4. Ms. Kapoor submits that the conviction is based on circumstantial evidence. She further submits that no incriminating circumstances have been proved against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. She submits that insofar as recovery of the bloodstained clothes is 772 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports concerned, it is found at a place accessible to one and all and she further submits that the recovery panchnama also does not mention the date of recovery. She therefore submits that, the conviction under Section 302 IPC is not at all tenable. 5. Ms. Kapoor further submits that even the conviction under Section 304B and 498A would not be tenable. She submits that the matter was compromised between the deceased and the accused. It is submitted that taking into consideration the above aspect, the amended charge came to be framed on 14.03.2007, restricting the claim with regard to cruelty only for the period between 21.10.2003 and 29.05.2004 i.e. from the date of the discharge by the learned Magistrate in the earlier proceedings till the date on which Meena was found dead. Ms. Kapoor further submits that during this period there is no allegation against the appellant herein, which would attract the provisions of Section 498A IPC. It is submitted that the prosecution fails to prove the guilt. The conviction under Section 304B IPC would also not be tenable. 6. Shri Rajan Kumar Chourasia, learned counsel appearing for the respondent, on the contrary, submits that both the Courts, upon correct appreciation of evidence, have concurrently found the appellant herein guilty for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC. It is, therefore, submitted that no interference is warranted with the conviction recorded under Section 302 IPC. It is submitted that insofar as conviction under Section 498A and 304B IPC are concerned, the same has been affirmed by this Court in the case of three co-accused persons, as such the said finding has attained finality. 7. With the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties, we have scrutinized the evidence. 8. Undoubtedly, the case of the prosecution rests on circumstantial evidence. The law with regard to conviction on the basis of circumstantial evidence has very well been crystalized in the of this Court in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra1, wherein this Court held thus: “152. Before discussing the cases relied upon by the High Court we would like to cite a few decisions on the nature, 1 (1984) 4 SCC 116 : 1984 INSC 121 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
