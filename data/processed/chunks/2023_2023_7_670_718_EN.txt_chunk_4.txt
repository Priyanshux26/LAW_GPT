The pre-existing clause that the power would be “at a price not exceeding pooled cost of the power purchase” was altered to “at the pooled cost of power purchase”. This change, was through the Second Amendment (to the REC Regulations), carried out on 10.07.2013. E It is a matter of record, that for the period between 29.03.2102 and 10.07.2013 - and indeed, after the Second Amendment, no difficulty was experienced in the pricing mechanism agreed by the parties, under the PPA. It was on 10.12.2013 that the respondent WPD approached the state commission for re- F determination of tariff. Clearly, this was an opportunistic attempt to derive advantage from the change, brought about by the Second Amendment, and seek to have it applied to an existing contract, which cannot be countenanced. In view of these reasons, it is held that the reasoning of APTEL, and the State Commission cannot be upheld.

Applicability of the Second Amendment to pre-existing contracts- the general law In the present case, the PPAs were entered into in the B exercise of equal bargaining power, after due negotiation by the parties, and within the framework of existing regulations: both central and state. Therefore, unless any later amendment expressly overrides existing contracts, the terms of such agreements bind the parties. Thus, agreements such as the PPAs C in the present case, entered into, voluntarily by the parties, before the Second Amendment, were not affected, by its terms. The findings to the contrary in the impugned , are set aside. [Paras 63, 66][714-C; 715-G; 716-A] PTC India Ltd. v. CERC [2010] 3 SCR 609 – distinguished. D Purbanchal Cables & Conductors (P) Ltd. v.

Were the respondents coerced into entering into PPAs APTEL, in the most cavalier fashion, virtually rubber stamped the State Commission’s findings on coercion, in regard to the entering into the PPA by the parties. There was no shred of evidence, nor any particularity of pleadings, beyond a bare F allegation of coercion, alleged against Gujarat Urja. It is incomprehensible how such an allegation could have been entertained and incorporated as a finding, given that the respondents are established companies, who enter into negotiations and have the support of experts, including legal advisers, when contracts are finalized. The findings regarding G coercion are, therefore, wholly untenable. The casual approach of APTEL, in not reasoning how such findings could be rendered, cannot be countenanced. As a judicial tribunal, dealing with contracts and bargains, which are entered into by parties with equal bargaining power, APTEL is not expected to casually render H GUJARAT URJA VIKAS NIGAM LIMITED v.
