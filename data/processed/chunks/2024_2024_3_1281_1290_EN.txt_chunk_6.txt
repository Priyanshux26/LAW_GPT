ii) The affidavits and the communications between the office of the Sub-Divisional Officer, the Deputy Commissioner and Binode Behari Basak and his wife Smt. Hem Prova Basak, are neither disputed nor denied. If that is so then it was more than clear that under the policy of the Government the allotment was being made for the family and not for the individual. 9. Binode Behari Basak and Hem Prova Basak both having admitted the said fact could not turn around to claim that it was their exclusive property. The High Court has gone completely wrong in ignoring these affidavits and communications giving the reason that they were given in a different proceeding and therefore would not be of relevance and any help to the defendants. 10. The lease deed in the exclusive name of Smt. Hem Prova Basak dated 03.11.1975 having been cancelled and the challenge to the said cancellation by way of a Civil Suit No.68 of 1995 having been withdrawn, the suit itself ought to have been dismissed, as the very basis of filing the suit was no longer in existence. The High Court failed to take into consideration this aspect of the matter thereby committing an error. 1290 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 11. From a perusal of the plaint, it appears that there has been bickering amongst the family members of the brothers and there were cases registered for maintaining tranquillity and peace, appears to be the reason for filing of the suit to deprive the two younger brothers from the benefit of the allotment made treating the family as a unit for rehabilitation. 12. For all the reasons recorded above, the impugned s passed by the High Court and the First Appellate Court are set aside and that of the Trial Court is restored. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
