This Court held that the communication reflected the decision of the Coal India Limited which was an instrumentality of the Government of India. The said case has no application to the facts of the present case. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 487 Nabha Power Limited & Anr. v. Punjab State Power Coroporation Limited & Anr. 69. The in Burn Standard Company Limited Vs. McDermott International INC and Anr. (1991) 2 SCC 669 also does not advance the case of the appellant. That case dealt with permission granted to an individual entity and whether on the facts of that case there existed a valid permission by the Reserve Bank of India. The issue involved in the present case is vastly different and we find the in Burn Standard (Supra) of no relevance to this case. 70. The closer to our facts is Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited vs. Adani Power Maharashtra Limited and Others (2023) 7 SCC 401. In the said case, neither the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs dated 06.02.2013 nor the Press Release of 21.06.2013 was considered as the relevant date for change in law and only 26.07.2013 which was the date on which the Office Memorandum was issued providing further instructions regarding the implementation of the New Coal Distributional Policy [NCDP] was considered as the change in law event. Pursuant to the Office Memorandum of 26.07.2013, the Ministry of Power issued a communication of 31.07.2013 setting out the decision taken. This case clearly supports the case of the respondent that the press release of 01.10.2009 on the facts herein could not have been the basis for the appellant to assume that a new legal regime had commenced in with effect from that date. 71. Though several s were cited, including Bachhittar Singh vs. The State of Punjab [1962] Supp. 3 SCR 713, to contend that the press release of 01.10.2009 was not an “”, we do not propose to examine them as we are otherwise convinced for the reason set out above that the 01.10.2009 Press Release is not law under Clause 1.1. Equally, for that reason, we have not discussed the cases on Article 77 of the Constitution of India, dealing with authentication of s. 72. The State Commission while rejecting the contention of the appellant has rightly recorded the following operative findings:- “In view of the above findings, the Commission holds that since the Mega Power Status was granted to the Project under the Mega Power Policy by the Ministry of Power on 30.07.2010 on the application dated 11.05.2010 filed by the respondent no.1, having become eligible on 16.04.2010, the benefits, if any, accruing thereunder 488 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports to the Project would be applicable only from 30.07.2010 and not from any prior date, notwithstanding that the decision for granting the Mega Power Status was taken/ announced on 01.10.2009 or the notifications in respect of the said decision of the Union Cabinet were issued by the concerned Ministries of the Government of India on 11.12.2009 and 14.12.2009.” 73.
