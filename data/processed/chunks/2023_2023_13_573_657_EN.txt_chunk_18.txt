40. Notification No.2 of 2006 dated 01.03.2006 was issued in supersession of Notifi cation No.13 of 2002 dated 01.03.2002 specifying thereunder the goods covered under Section 4A of Act 1944 for MRP- based assessment. It was noticed that the notifi cation did not specify the goods falling under CET SH 2403 9930 (‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’) but covered the goods falling under CET SH 2403 9910 (‘chewing tobacco’). Since the ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was not specifi ed under MRP-based assessment under Section 4A of CE Act, the goods had to be assessed under Section 4 of the CE Act. The abatement provided to the goods classifi ed under CET SH 2403 9910 was 50 percent. Hence, if the goods are cleared as ‘chewing tobacco’ the duty has to be paid on lower value resulting in payment of a lesser amount of duty, as the value determined under Section 4A after 50 percent abatement was much lesser compared to transactional value under Section 4 of CE Act. It is for this precise reason the assessee changed the classifi cation from ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ to ‘chewing tobacco’. ‘Zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was brought into the ambit of Section 4A of the CE Act (MRP-based assessment), by virtue of amendment to Notifi cation No.2 of 2006 vide Notifi cation No.16 of 2006 dated 11.07.2006. In other words, ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ was not specifi ed for assessment under Section 4A of CE Act for the period 01.03.2006 to 10.07.2006. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the considered view the contention of the assessee cannot be accepted and the Revenue was correct and justifi ed in issuing the show cause notice. 41. One of the contentions raised by the assessee throughout has been that they had fi led a letter on 30.03.2006 clearly showing the change in the COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. AHMEDABAD v. M/S URMIN 599 PRODUCTS P. LTD. AND OTHERS [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] classifi cation by the assessee and the reasons for the change were shown in the statement as well as their letter dated 25.06.2007 and there was no suppression. In fact, the adjudicating authority has extracted the contents of the letter dated 30.03.2006 in paragraph 13.1 of the OIO dated 28.01.2008. However, for immediate reference and at the cost of repetition it is extracted herein below: “This is to inform you that as per the practice followed by our industry, we classifi ed our product; chewing tobacco into CETSH 2403 9910.” 42. It is an admitted fact that till the fi ling of this letter, the assessee continued to classify the product as ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’ falling under CET SH 2403 9930. It is for this precise reason, that the adjudicating authority has observed, and rightly so that the letter dated 30.03.2006 had been cleverly drafted and it does not mention in detail the product which they were manufacturing at that material time namely ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’. Though the classifi cation in the letter shows entry CET SH 2403 9910 (‘chewing tobacco’), it would depict a picture as though it is a new product.
