The certificate is ultimately the evidence of the fact that the auction in favour of the person to whom a certificate is issued, has been confirmed by the Executing Court. 19. Prima facie, it appears to us that the only way of avoiding E inconsistency between Rule 95 of XXI of CPC and Article 134 of the Limitation Act is to read into Article 134 that the starting point for making an application under Rule 95 of XXI of CPC is the date on which a certificate recording confirmation of auction sale is actually issued to the purchaser. Such interpretation will satisfy the three tests laid down in the case of Inco Europe Limited & Ors.4 Therefore, in F our considered view, the decision of the Co-ordinate Bench in the case of Pattam Khader Khan2 and especially, what is held in paragraph 11, requires reconsideration by the larger Bench. In our considered view, the larger Bench will have to decide the issue relating to the starting point of limitation for making an application under Rule 95 of XXI G of CPC. We direct the Registrar (J-I) to place this appeal along with a copy of this before the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India to enable him to take appropriate decision on the administrative side.
