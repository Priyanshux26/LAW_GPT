Furthermore, it is contended that even if a “divorced Muslim woman” seeks to move the court under the secular provision of Section 125 of CrPC 1973, it would not be maintainable, rather the correct procedure would be to file an application under Section 5 of the 1986 Act, which is not the case herein. 6. To substantiate the said contentions, the learned Senior Advocate for the Appellant herein, vehemently argued that since the 1986 Act provides a more beneficial and efficacious remedy for divorced Muslim women in contradistinction to Section 125 of CrPC 1973, thereby the recourse lies exclusively under the 1986 Act. In addition, it is submitted that the 1986 Act being a special law, prevails over the provisions of CrPC 1973. To buttress his contentions, reliance is placed on a decision rendered by a 3-Judge Bench in M/s. Jain Ink Manufacturing Company v. Life Insurance Corporation of India and Another (1980) 4 SCC 435 wherein this Court went on to hold that a special law would supersede a general law and if such conflicting statutes are passed by the same legislature, the rule of harmonious construction is to be applied while interpreting the said statutes. Several other s to this effect were also brought to our notice with the similar position being reiterated as in a recent of this Court in Chennupati Kranthi Kumar v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Others (2023) 8 SCC 251. 7. He further emphasised that Sections 3 and 4 of the 1986 Act, commencing with a non-obstante clause, shall have an overriding effect on any other statute operating in the same field. An acknowledgment to this effect is said to have been found in a 5-Judge Bench in Danial Latifi and Another v. Union of India (2001) 7 SCC 740 and specifically in paragraph numbers 21 to 24. Further reliance is placed on paragraph numbers 03, 07, 08, and 1252 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 09 of the in Iqbal Bano v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another (2007) 6 SCC 785. Another limb of his submission is based upon the transitional provision of Section 7 of the 1986 Act, in an attempt to establish supersedence and clarity as to the intent of the legislature on prevalence of the 1986 Act and the procedure and rights contemplated therein. 8. To assist this Court, Mr Gaurav Agrawal, Senior Advocate, was appointed as amicus curiae vide dated 09.02.2024, who eventually went on to submit that the remedy under a secular statutory provision of Section 125 of CrPC 1973 is not foreclosed for a divorced Muslim woman by virtue of enactment of a personal law remedy under Section 3 of the 1986 Act to the limited extent of maintenance, as the latter does not in any manner, expressly or by necessary implication, bar the exercise of former remedy. To buttress this submission, he went on to highlight the distinction between the very object and purpose of the aforesaid provisions. Mr Agrawal, while also extensively referring to the 5-Judge Bench decision in Danial Latifi (supra), goes on to submit that the explicit question as to whether the non-obstante clause in Section 3 of the 1986 Act takes away the rights under Section 125 of CrPC 1973, was not dealt by this Court therein.
