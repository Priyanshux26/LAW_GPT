Taxation is a mode of raising revenue to fund public expenditure. The power of taxation is an essential and inherent attribute of sovereignty.141 In the decision of the US Supreme Court in McCulloch 140 Government of India, Ministry of Mines, ‘Mineral Royalties’ 27 (January 2011) 141 Thomas Cooley, The Law of Taxation (4th edn, 1924) 149 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1641 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. v. Maryland,142 Chief Justice John Marshall described the sovereign right of taxation thus: “It is admitted that the power of taxing the people and their property is essential to the very existence of Government, and may be legitimately exercised on the objects to which it is applicable, to the utmost extent to which the Government may choose to carry it. The only security against the abuse of this power is found in the structure of the Government itself. In imposing a tax, the legislature acts upon its constituents. This is, in general, a sufficient security against erroneous and oppressive taxation.” 102. Taxes are monetary burdens or charges imposed by legislative power upon persons, or property to raise revenues.143 The government needs requisite funds to discharge its primary governmental functions.144 No responsible government can function and achieve its welfare objectives without levying and collecting taxes.145 The objects to be taxed can be taxed by the legislature according to the exigencies of its needs so long as they happen to be within the legislative competence of the legislature.146 Although the power of taxation is pervasive and an incidence of sovereignty, it is subject to well-defined constitutional limitations. 103. In Matthews v. Chicory Marketing Board,147 Latham CJ defined “tax” as a “compulsory exaction of money by a public authority for public purposes, enforceable by law, and … not a payment for services rendered.” In Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowment, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirta Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt,148 this Court relied on the above elucidation to enumerate the following essential characteristics of a tax: “44. […] It is said that the essence of taxation is compulsion, that is to say, it is imposed under statutory power without 142 17 U.S. 316 (1819) 143 Amrit Banaspati Co. Ltd. v. State of Punjab (1992) 2 SCC 411 [10] 144 Dena Bank v. Bhikabhai Prabhudas Parekh & Co. (2000) 5 SCC 694 [8] 145 Jindal Stainless Steel [112.2] 146 Rai Ramkrishna v. State of Bihar [1964] 1 SCR 897 [12] 147 60 CLR 263 148 [1954] 1 SCR 1005 : (1954) 1 SCC 412 1642 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the taxpayer’s consent and the payment is enforced by law. The second characteristic of tax is that it is an imposition made for public purpose without reference to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax. This is expressed by saying that the levy of tax is for the purposes of general revenue, which when collected forms part of the public revenues of the State.
