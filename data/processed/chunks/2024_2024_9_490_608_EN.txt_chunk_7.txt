[Para 59] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – ss. 34 and 48 (as amended by the Amendment, 2015) – Explanation 1 clause (iii) to s. 34(2)(b)(ii) and s. 48(2)(b) inserted by 2015 Amendment, that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India, inter alia, if it conflicts with the ‘most basic notions of morality or justice’ – Most basic notions of ‘justice’ – Explanation: Held: Term ‘legal justice’ is not used in Explanation 1, thus, simple conformity or non-conformity with the law is not the test to determine whether an award is in conflict with the public policy of India in terms of Explanation 1 – Test is that it must conflict with the most 500 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports basic notions of justice – For lack of any objective criteria, it is difficult to enumerate the ‘most basic notions of justice’ – More so, justice to one may be injustice to another – As regards justice being done, it is about rendering, in accord with law, what is right and equitable to one who has suffered a wrong – Dispensation of justice in its quality may vary, dependent on person who dispenses it – Thus, the placement of words “most basic notions” before “of justice” in Explanation 1 has its significance – Object of inserting Explanations 1 and 2 in place of earlier explanation to s. 34(2)(b)(ii) was to limit the scope of interference with an arbitral award, thus the amendment consciously qualified the term ‘justice’ with ‘most basic notions’ of it – Giving a broad dimension to this category would be deviating from the legislative intent – Thus, considering that the concept of justice is open-textured, and notions of justice could evolve with changing needs of the society, it would not be prudent to cull out “the most basic notions of justice” – They ought to be such elementary principles of justice that their violation could be figured out by a prudent member of the public who may, or may not, be judicially trained, which means, that their violation would shock the conscience of a legally trained mind – This ground would be available to set aside an award, if the award conflicts with such elementary/fundamental principles of justice that it shocks the conscience of the Court. [Paras 55, 58] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s. 34 (2-A) (as inserted by the Amendment, 2015) –Sub-section (2-A) of s. 34 providing that the Court may also set aside an arbitral award if it is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award – Patent illegality appearing on the face of the award – Meaning of: Held: Proviso to sub-section (2-A) states that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence – Thus, an award could be set aside if it is patently illegal – However, illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature, it cannot be held that award is against public policy.
