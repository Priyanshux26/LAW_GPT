[Paras 19 to 22] Interpretation of Regulations – Use of the term “Regulations” should not detract from their function: Held: The use of the term “Regulations” should not detract from their function, which is akin to any other administrative s or circulars that an authority like the CIC might promulgate to ensure the smooth operation of its duties – The essence of these regulations lies in their role in facilitating the internal management and procedural operations of the Commission, a necessity clearly envisioned by the broad powers of superintendence, direction, and management granted under Section 12(4) of the RTI Act – By focusing on the terminology, the objections fail to appreciate the functional equivalence of these regulations to other forms of administrative guidance – The regulations were crafted to address the practical needs of the Commission, providing structure and clarity to its operations, in any administrative context – Therefore, raising objections based solely on the label “Regulations” is an exercise in semantics rather than a substantive argument. [Para 23] RTI Act – Autonomy of the Central Information Commission – Principle of non-interference: Held: The autonomy of the Central Information Commission is of paramount importance to its effective functioning – Any undue interference in its administrative functions, such as the power to constitute benches, would significantly impede its ability to handle the large volume of cases efficiently and expeditiously – The CIC must be allowed to operate independently and exercise its powers of superintendence, direction, and management without external constraints – The principle of non-interference is crucial for maintaining the integrity and efficacy of the CIC – Allowing the Commission to function autonomously ensures that it can fulfil its role in promoting transparency and accountability, which are the cornerstones of the RTI Act – The ability to form benches and allocate work among Information Commissioners is essential for the CIC to manage its workload effectively and uphold the citizens’ right to information.
