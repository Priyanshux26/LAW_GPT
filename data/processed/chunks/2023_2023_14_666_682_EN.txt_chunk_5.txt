The Appellant Bank vide letter dated 26.08.2022, acknowledged the receipt of the said amount. 3. The Applicant (original respondent no.6 in C.A. No. 1902 of 2020) has now fi led the instant M.A. No.1735 of 2022 seeking the directions as stated hereinabove. The application has been resisted by the Respondents by fi ling their respective replies. The Respondent no.1 Rajat Infrastructure has mainly contended that the Miscellaneous Application fi led in the disposed of Civil Appeal, seeking directions to the bank for issuing the sale certifi cate is not maintainable, more particularly when the Applicant has failed to comply with the s passed by this Court from time to time and when the Applicant has also not complied with the provisions contained in Rule 9 of the said Rules. The Respondent no.1 has also alleged collusion between the Applicant and the Appellant Bank. The other Respondents no.2 to 5 have also broadly supported the contentions raised by the Respondent no.1. The Appellant Bank has fi led the affi davit in reply on 23.11.2022 relying upon its earlier affi davit fi led with regard to the status report dated 06.08.2022 (Annexure A7 of the M.A. paper book).

However, taking note of the s passed by this Court in Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) No.03 of 2020, extending period of limitation in all proceedings before the Courts and Tribunals, including this Court, on account of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, it may be safely presumed that the time limit whenever was to expire in the proceedings was extended upto February 2022, and that in the instant case, therefore UNION BANK OF INDIA v. RAJAT INFRASTRUCTURE PVT. LTD. & 675 ORS. AND M/S. SUNVIEW ASSETS PVT. LTD. [BELA M. TRIVEDI, J.] the Applicant was required to deposit the amount as directed by this Court in the dated 12.05.2020, two months after February 2022 i.e., on or before 30.04.2022. 5. Before adverting to the contentions raised by the learned counsels for the Respondents, with regard to the maintainability of the instant Miscellaneous Application seeking directions against the Appellant-Bank for issuance of sale letter in favour of the Applicant, let us fi rst address the issue whether the extension of time sought by the Applicant in the successive applications was permissible in the eye of law, and even if permissible, whether the Applicant had in fact complied with the s passed by the Court from time to time in the said applications.
