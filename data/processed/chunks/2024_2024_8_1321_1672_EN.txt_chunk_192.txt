(i) Whether the provisions contained under Section 4(5) of the Punjab Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services Act, 2006) are constitutionally valid? (ii) Whether the State had the legislative competence to enact the provisions contained under Section 4(5) of the Act. (iii) Whether the decision in E.V. Chinnaiah vs. State of Andhra Pradesh and Others is required to be revisited. 13. The Five-Judge Bench however, after extensively referring various paragraphs of the decision in Indra Sawhney opined that E.V. Chinnaiah is required to be revisited by a larger bench. It was observed by the Five-Judge Bench therein* that: - * [2020] 10 SCR 857 : (2020) 8 SCC 1 * [2020] 10 SCR 857 : (2020) 8 SCC 1 1590 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “44. The question arises whether sub-classification for providing benefit to all castes can be said to be tinkering with the list under Articles 341, 342 and 342-A, in view of the decisions in Indra Sawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1], permitting sub-classifications of backward classes and in Jarnail Singh [Jarnail Singh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta, (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019) 1 SCC (L&S) 86] , in which, it was opined that “creamy layer concept” for exclusion of benefit can be applied to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and it does not in any manner tinker with the Presidential List under Articles 341 or 342 of the Constitution. The caste or group or sub-group continued exactly as before in the List. It is only those persons within that group or sub-group, who have come out of untouchability or backwardness by virtue of belonging to the creamy layer, who are excluded from the benefit of reservation. The million dollar question is how to trickle down the benefit to the bottom rung; reports indicate that benefit is being usurped by those castes (class) who have come up and adequately represented. It is clear that caste, occupation, and poverty are interwoven. The State cannot be deprived of the power to take care of the qualitative and quantitative difference between different classes to take ameliorative measures. 45. Reservation was not contemplated for all the time by the Framers of the Constitution. On the one hand, there is no exclusion of those who have come up, on the other hand, if sub-classification is denied, it would defeat right to equality by treating unequal as equal. In Chebrolu Leela Prasad Rao v. State of A.P. [Chebrolu Leela Prasad Rao v. State of A.P., (2021) 11 SCC 401 : 2020 SCC OnLine SC 383] , the necessity of revising lists was pointed out relying on Indra Sawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1] and Union of India v. Rakesh Kumar [Union of India v. Rakesh Kumar, (2010) 4 SCC 50 : (2010) 1 SCC (L&S) 961]. 46.
