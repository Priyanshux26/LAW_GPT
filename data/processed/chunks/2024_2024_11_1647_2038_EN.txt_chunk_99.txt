c. Article 14 of the Constitution was violated because the terms of the Act establishing Benares Hindu University (BHU) were not the same as the terms of the AMU Act, 1920. Further, other universities, such as Delhi, Agra, Allahabad, Patna, and Benares, have a certain elective element, unlike AMU. d. Article 19 of the Constitution was violated because the 1965 Amendment Act deprived Muslims of their right to manage AMU and of the right to hold the property vested in AMU by the AMU Act, 1920. 1790 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports e. Vide the 1965 Amendment Act, the Muslim minority was deprived of their property, under Article 31(1), as the composition of the Court was changed from the terms of the 1920 Act. f. The 1951 and 1965 Amendment Acts violated Articles 25 and 29 of the Constitution. D.1.2. Contentions of the Respondents 62. Conversely, the Respondents submitted that: a. AMU was established in 1920 by the AMU Act, 1920 and this establishment was not by the Muslim minority, but by the Government of India (GoI) by virtue of a Statute. Thus, the Muslim minority could not claim any Fundamental Right to administer AMU under Article 30(1). b. Since AMU was established by the GoI, the Parliament had the right to amend that Statute as it thought fit. There was no question of taking away the right to administer under the 1951 and 1965 Amendment Acts, as the Muslim minority never had the right of administration. c. Though the Court of AMU was to be composed entirely of Muslims, under the AMU Act, 1920, they were not given the right to administer the university. It was to be administered by the authorities established under the AMU Act, 1920. D.2. Issues formulated 63. While this Court in Azeez Basha (supra) did not explicitly outline the issues, a plain reading of the decision reveals the following key issues that were broadly addressed: a. Whether a ‘university’ established prior to the Constitution coming into force could be construed to be an educational institution included within the ambit of Article 30? b. What is the meaning of the term ‘establish’ in Article 30 and whether AMU was established by the Muslim minority? c. Whether AMU was administered by Muslims? d. Whether the 1951 and 1965 Amendment Acts were violative of other Articles contained in Part III of the Constitution? [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1791 Aligarh Muslim University v. Naresh Agarwal & Ors. D.3. Key holdings in Azeez Basha (supra) 64. In the decision of Azeez Basha (supra), the Constitution Bench adjudicated that AMU was not a minority institution for the purposes of Article 30(1) of the Indian Constitution. Since the conclusion of this case forms the bedrock of the present challenge, it is essential to discuss the key holdings of this . 65. In this regard, the Court held that to be a minority institution under Article 30, such an institution must have been both established and administered by the minority community. In other words, it noted that the test provided under Article 30 is conjunctive, and an institution cannot enjoy autonomy to such an extent unless it satisfies both the prongs of establishment as well as administration by the minority community.
