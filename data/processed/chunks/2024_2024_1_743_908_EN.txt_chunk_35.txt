However, the s dated 10.08.2022 have not granted remission for each of the fifteen counts and is only a generic and blanket , making the release of the convicts illegal and arbitrary. 7.18. That respondent No.3 approached this Court in Writ Petition (Crl.) No.135 of 2022, without disclosing that he had already acted on the of the Gujarat High Court dated 17.07.2019 and had submitted his application to the Home Department, State of Maharashtra, and that his application had already been considered by the authorities concerned, whereby, the major stakeholders had written against the grant of remission to him. Further, when the matter was listed before this Court, no notice was issued to the petitioner– victim and neither was she heard by this Court in the matter. 7.19. That the s dated 10.08.2022 have blatantly ignored the grave and real apprehension regarding the safety and security of the victims-survivors raised by public functionaries whose opinions are required to be taken into account by respondent No.1 State before granting premature release as per the 1992 policy. That this Court in a catena of s, such as, Epuru Sudhakar and Rajan vs. Home Secretary, Home Department of Tamil Nadu (2019) 14 SCC 114 (“Rajan”) has highlighted the importance of considering the impact of premature release on the victims in particular and the society in general. That even the Superintendent of Police, Dahod, on 03.02.2020 had recommended against the release of [2024] 1 S.C.R. 797 Bilkis Yakub Rasool v. Union of India & Others Radheyshyam Bhagwandas Shah as he had cited the possibility of peace being disturbed. The Sessions Judge, Panchmahal at Godhra also raised questions regarding the security of the victim – petitioner herein. 7.20. Learned counsel next asserted that the en-masse and non- speaking “sanction” of the Central Government dated 11.07.2022 under Section 435(1)(a) of the CrPC does not meet the statutory requirement of “consultation”. The said sanction conveys its approval for the premature release of eleven convicts sans any reason as to why the case of each respondent-convict is deemed fit for grant of remission. Thus, the approval was granted without considering the relevant factors outlined in Laxman Naskar. 7.21. That non-application of mind is evident in the non-speaking and stereotyped s dated 10.08.2022 which are bereft of any reason. The s are devoid of reasons or grounds as to why the respondents-convicts were found fit for the grant of remission. All of the eleven s are a verbatim replication of each other, having only substituted the name and personal details of the respondents-convicts. Further, the recommendations of the Jail Advisory Committee dated 26.05.2022 as regards remission of respondent Nos.3 to 13 are untenable, being arbitrary and mechanical and vitiated by non-application of mind. The said opinions are verbatim and mechanical reproductions of each other that show no independent consideration of facts of each case of the convicts. 7.22. With the aforesaid submissions, it was prayed that Writ Petition (Crl.) No.491 of 2022 be allowed and a writ, or direction be issued quashing the s dated 10.08.2022 passed by the State of Gujarat by which the convicts in Sessions Case No.
