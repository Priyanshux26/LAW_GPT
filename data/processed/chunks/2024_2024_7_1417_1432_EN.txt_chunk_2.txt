Neelam Aggarwal (Defendant No. 5) 17% 7. Amarnath Singla (Defendant No. 6) 3.75% 8. Laxmi Devi (Defendant No. 7) 3.75% 9. Meena Singla (Defendant No. 8) 3.75% 10. Seema Rani (Defendant No. 9) 3.75% 4. The aforesaid position was before the sale of their respective shares by defendant No.3-Bhupinder Singh to defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla and by defendant Nos.6 to 9 to defendant Nos.15 to 19. Preliminary decree for partition of the suit property to the extent of 25% share was passed by the Trial Court on 10.10.2012 in favour of the plaintiff. As the property could not be partitioned on account of legal bar under the Chandigarh (Sale of Sites and Buildings) Rules, 1960,5 the same was directed to be auctioned. The preliminary decree was also passed for rendition of accounts against the defendants wherein all the co-sharers of the suit property were directed to render accounts. Defendant Nos.4 & 5 having inducted tenants in some portion of the suit property in their possession were directed to submit the accounts of rent collected by them. The market rate of the rent of the portions in possession of defendant no.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla and defendant Nos.15 to 19 were to be determined while passing the final decree. Defendant No.3(a) having stepped into the shoes of defendant No.3, defendant Nos.4 & 5, and defendant Nos.15 to 19, having stepped into the shoes of defendant Nos.6 to 9, were restrained from creating charge or encumbrances on the suit property. 5. Challenging the aforesaid preliminary decree passed by the Trial Court, two appeals were filed. Civil Appeal No. 857 of 2012 was filed by defendant No.3(a), and Civil Appeal No. 850 of 2012 was filed 5 Hereinafter referred to as ‘the 1960 Rules’ [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1421 Rajinder Kaur (Deceased) Through Legal Heir Usha v. Gurbhajan Kaur (Deceased) Through Lrs Upinder Kaur and Others by defendant Nos.15 to 19, the subsequent buyers from defendant Nos.6 to 9. 5.1. Inter alia the ground raised by defendant No.3(a)-S.C. Bhalla regarding the mesne profit was that the assessment of the rent by the Trial Court was not appropriate as material evidence placed on record was not considered. Rent being given by a tenant for a small area cannot be made the basis of assessment of rent of the complete building. There was no denial as such regarding his liability to pay the rent. He had even admitted the fact that certain tenants had been inducted by him. 5.2. The defendant Nos.15 to 19/appellants before the First Appellate Court are in possession of part of the suit property on the ground floor, in which they are carrying on business. The appeal was filed primarily on two grounds, firstly, that the property was sold to them while concealing the fact of pendency of the civil suit regarding partition of the property and passing of restraint . Another objection raised by them was for rendition of accounts claiming that they were in possession of less than 15 % share of the suit property and had not been collecting any rent, hence, no accounts are to be rendered.
