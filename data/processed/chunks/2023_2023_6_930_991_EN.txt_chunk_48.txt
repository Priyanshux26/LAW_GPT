This would mean that the law of limitation, being a procedural law, is retrospective in operation in the sense that it will also apply to proceedings pending at the time of the enactment as also to proceedings commenced thereafter, notwithstanding that the cause of action may have arisen before the new provisions came into force. However, it F must be noted that there is an important exception to this rule also. Where the right of suit is barred under the law of limitation in force before the new provision came into operation and a vested right has accrued to another, the new provision cannot revive the barred right or take away the accrued vested right.” G 72. A contention is taken that the Court is not dealing with a suit and the matter arises from a proceeding under Section 52 of the Act. It is contended that in regard to Section 52 the bar of limitation for a suit is inapplicable. We have noticed that the debate in the High Court essentially H 26 AIR 1965 SC 241 SABIR ALI KHAN v. SYED MOHD. AHMAD ALI KHAN AND 991 OTHERS [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] centered around the question whether Article 96 would apply and applying A the same, the appellant could get around the impact of Article 65 read with Section 27 of the Act. We have found that Article 96 has no application. Even in regard to a proceeding under the Act be it Section 52 if as on the date the action is taken, the title in the property stood vested with the person in possession by virtue of Section 27 of the B Limitation Act then it may not be permissible to ignore the right which had been acquired. The decision in T. Kaliamurthi (supra) would apply in the facts and the action is barred. 73. The upshot of the above discussion is that the Appeals are to be found without merit and will stand dismissed. Parties to bear their C respective costs. Nidhi Jain Appeals dismissed.
