Meanwhile, Section 48 of the CPC deals with subsequent applications and fixes an outer limit when execution remains unsatisfied. 8.

Amar Poultry Farm1 wherein it was observed that limitation for the first execution application shall be governed by Article 182 of the J&K Limitation Act.

Furthermore, the provision of Section 14 of the Limitation Act is para materia to the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, as applicable to the then State of Jammu and Kashmir. 16.
