6. Now so far as the reliance placed upon Section 4 of the RTI C Act is concerned, under Section 4(2) of the RTI Act a duty is cast upon the public authority to take steps in accordance with the requirements of clause (b) of sub- Section 1 of Section 4 of the RTI Act to provide as much information suo moto to the public at regular intervals through various means of communications. Copies of the chargesheet and the D relevant documents along with the charge-sheet do not fall within Section 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act. Under the circumstances also the reliance placed upon Section 4(1)(2) of the RTI Act is also misconceived and misplaced. 7. In view of the above and for the reason stated above, the petitioner is not entitled to the relief as prayed in the present petition E namely directing all the States to put on their websites the copies of all the chargesheets/challans filed under Section 173 of the Cr.P.C. Present writ petition lacks merits and the same deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed. F Nidhi Jain Writ Petition dismissed. (Assisted by : Abhishek Agnihotri, LCRA) G H
