156/MP/ E 2014 as well; and (b) Direct the Respondents to pay Rs. 895.41 Crores (Rs. 566.83 Crores related to Domestic Coal Shortfall + Rs. 328.58 Crores related to taxes and duties) unilaterally deducted from the monthly bills/supplementary invoices along with the applicable Late F Payment Surcharge.” 6. CERC framed the following issues: “Issue No.1: Whether the Petition is maintainable under Section 142 of the Act? G Issue No. 2: Whether our finding in respect of IPT coal at Para 61 of the dated 31.5.2018 in Petition No. 97/MP/2017 is applicable for the compensation payable for various taxes and duties approved as change in law in the dated 6.2.2017 in Petition No. 156/MP/2014? H UTTAR HARYANA BIJLI VITRAN NIGAM LTD. v. ADANI 1101 POWER (MUNDRA) LTD. [B. R. GAVAI, J.] Issue No. 3: What should be the treatment of Inter Plant Transfer A of Coal, if it is considered as change in law? Issue No. 4: What should be the basis for calculating shortfall of domestic coal?” 7. Insofar as Issue No. 1 is concerned, CERC held the dispute to B be maintainable. 8. Insofar as Issue No. 2 is concerned, CERC held that in view of its dated 6thFebruary 2017 in Petition No. 156/MP/2014, the coal supply, under Fuel Supply Agreement (for short, “FSA”) dated 9thJune 2012, to other plants has to be accounted for the generation and supply C of power to Haryana Utilities from Units 7, 8 and 9 of Mundra TPP for all commercial purposes. It, therefore, rejected the contention of Haryana Utilities that it was liable to pay taxes and duties only for the coal that it has actually consumed and not for IPT coal. 9. Insofar as Issue No. 3 is concerned, CERC held that the transfer D of coal by AP(M)L under IPT Policy also affects other generating stations that are consuming IPT coal and other distribution companies who are also supplied power by the generating stations that have used IPT coal. Since other distribution companies were not parties to the proceedings before CERC, it did not find it appropriate to deal with the issue. E 10. Insofar as Issue No. 4 is concerned, CERC, in view of the of this Court in the case of Energy Watchdog (supra), held that the quantum of shortfall has to be calculated taking into consideration the Assured Coal Quantity (for short, “ACQ”) and the quantity actually supplied by the coal companies. F 11. Being aggrieved thereby, Haryana Utilities filed an appeal before APTEL. 12. Insofar as Issue No. 4 is concerned, APTEL, vide its and dated 21st December 2021, relying on the of this Court in the case of Energy Watchdog (supra), held that ‘Change in G Law’ compensation needs to be calculated as ACQ – actual supply. 13. Insofar as the issue with regard to communication dated 19th June 2013 being ‘Change in Law’ is concerned, APTEL held the same not to be ‘Change in Law’. Being aggrieved thereby, the present appeal.
