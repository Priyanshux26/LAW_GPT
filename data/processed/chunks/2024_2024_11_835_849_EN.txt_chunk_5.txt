Hence the Court awards a sum which is in the nature of a conventional award [Mediana, The (1900) AC 113, 116]” 13.2 Eric Cassell,10 an American Physician and Bioethicist, defines ‘pain’ not only as a sensation but also ‘as experience embedded in beliefs about causes and diseases and their consequences’, and ‘suffering’ as ‘the state of severe distress associated with events that threaten the intactness of person’. 13.3 In a recent article11 published in the journal of the International Association for the Study of Pain, it has been recorded that there is no consensus on what exactly the concept of pain-related suffering includes, and it is often not precisely operationalised in empirical studies. The authors in their systematic review analysed 111 articles across a variety of disciplines such as bioethics, medical ethics, psycho-oncology, anaesthesiology, philosophy, sociology etc., we may refer to few of them: 13.3.1 Eugene V. Boisaubin,12 who is currently a Professor at the University of Texas, at Houston, in a 1989 article defined it as “Suffering is experienced by individual and arises from threats to the integrity of the individual as a complex social and psychological entity.” 9 3rd Edition reprint 2009, Lexis Nexis, Butterworths Wadhwa, page 3441 10 http://www.ericcassell.com/bio.html 11 Noe-Steinmüller et.al, (2024) “Defining suffering in pain: a systematic review on pain-related suffering using natural language processing.” 165 (7) : p1434-1449 12 https://med.uth.edu/oep/members-2/eugene-v-boisaubin-md/ 844 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 13.3.2 Andrew Edgar, who is currently a Reader Emeritus in Philosophy at Cardiff University at UK has defined, in a 2007 article suffering as an “experience of life never getting better, revealing in the sufferer only vulnerability, futility, and impotence.” 13.3.3 Arthur W. Frank,13 Professor Emeritus, Department of Sociology, University of Calgary in his well-known article “Can We Research Suffering?”, published in 2001, observed that “at the core of suffering is the sense that something is irreparably wrong with our lives, and wrong is the negation of what could have been right. Suffering resists definition because it is the reality of what is not.” 13.3.4 Daryl Pullman14 who currently serves as University research Professor, Bioethics at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada in his 2002 article defined suffering as the “product of [physical], psychological, economic, or other factors that frustrate an individual in the pursuit of significant life projects.” 13.4 The Judicial Studies Board, now known as the Judicial College in the United Kingdom, produced guidelines in 1992 to produce greater consistency of awards and make the judicial scale of values more easily accessible. They have been deduced from a study of past cases, examining the range of awards therein. The latest edition of these guidelines was published in 2021.15 They record the difficulty of computing ‘pain and suffering’ as under :- “It is widely accepted that making of an award of general damages for pain and suffering is a somewhat artificial task. It involves the Judge seeking to convert the pain and suffering of a given claimant into a monetary award which he or she considers 13 https://sps.columbia.edu/faculty/arthur-w-frank-phd 14 https://www.mun.ca/medicine/faculty-and-staff-resources/faculty-a-z/pullman-daryl.php 15 See : Hassam and Anr.
