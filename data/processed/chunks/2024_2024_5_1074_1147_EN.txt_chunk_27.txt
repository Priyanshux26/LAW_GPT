High Court of Gujarat & Ors. rules of the personnel agency. Personnel agencies fix educational and experience requirements for eligibility to compete for promotion. A hint of the ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ principle can be traced in his words where he states that where the law requires that promotions be made from among those serving in the next lower grade, the incumbents of such lower positions would be deemed to be presumably qualified for promotion. For ‘Merit-cum- Seniority’, particularly, the competitive test/qualification criteria would serve to determine the relative excellence among those presumably qualified for promotion7, so that those demonstrating superior merit and fitness would be available to fill the vacancies.8 74. In Britain, the 1854 Northcote-Trevelyan Report founded a public service system based on merit, where open competitive examinations were practiced under the principle of promotion by merit but also held that seniority and experience counted in some respects.9 75. Similarly, in France, the 19th century saw the introduction of the doctrine of the “Concours” or competitive examination to support the merit system in the civil service, yet giving seniority and experience due regard in promotion to higher ranks.10 76. During the British Raj, the East India Company adopted the principle of seniority for promotions. This principle was officially recognized in the Charter Act, 1793 and continued until the enactment of the Indian Civil Service Act, 1861. Apart from the seniority principle, considerations of merit, integrity, competence, and ability were also taken into account for promotions. This ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ formula remained in practice until 1947. 77. The Indian Civil Service (hereinafter referred as the “ICS”) system, initiated in the 19th century, encapsulated aspects of recruitment based on competitive examinations and seniority. For entry into the ICS, competitive examinations were conducted and for promotions 7 Id. 8 Elman, B.A., Political, social, and cultural reproduction via civil service examinations in late imperial China, 50(1) Journal of Asian Studies, pp.7-28 (1991). 9 Jenifer Hart, The genesis of the Northcote–Trevelyan report, in Studies in the growth of nineteenth century government pp. 63-81 (Ed.

Under the Charter Act, 1833, following Lord Macaulay’s Report of the Select Committee of British Parliament11, the concept of competitive examinations in modern Civil Services in India was introduced in 1854. The Report recommended that the patronage-based system of East India Company should be replaced by a permanent Civil Service where candidates are recruited through competitive examinations.12 As stated, competitive examinations were “designed to protect career employees against improper political influences or personal favouritism in the recruiting, hiring, promotion, or dismissal processes, to ensure that personnel management is conducted without discrimination”.13 79.
