[Paras 13, 19, 20-29] Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.148(1) – Power of Appellate Court to payment pending appeal against conviction – “May” and “shall” in sub-section (1), (2), (3) and proviso to s.148 – Interpretation of: Held: Text is to be read as set in the context – Legislature has used both the verbs ‘may’ and shall’ in sub-section (1) of s.148, but in different contexts, clearly suggestive of the legislative intent to mean what it said – Verb ‘may’ in sub-section (1), implies discretion, and, if intended to have its natural meaning, it would refer to the discretion left to the appellate court to determine as to whether such court should any deposit to be made by the appellant or not pending hearing of the appeal against the conviction and sentence recorded by the trial court – Jamboo Bhandari’s case lays down that deposit may not be ed if the appellate court finds a case to [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1275 Muskan Enterprises & Anr. v. The State of Punjab & Anr. be exceptional – On the contrary, the verb ‘shall’ used in the same sentence and distanced from the verb ‘may’ implies an obligation or duty that is referable to the quantum of deposit – Deposit in any case, must not be less than 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial court – Once the appellate court is satisfied that a deposit is indeed called for, in an appropriate case, such court’s power is in no way fettered to call upon the appellant to deposit more than 20% of the awarded compensation, but in no case can it be less than 20% – While the proviso to sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of s.148 use ‘shall’ in the relevant context, sub-section (3) again reverts to ‘may’ and its proviso to ‘shall’ – Thus, ‘may’ would be read as ‘may’ and ‘shall’ as ‘shall’, wherever they are used in s. 148, because, the words mean what they say. [Paras 26-28] Interpretation of statutes – Construction of – Legislative intent, mandatory or directory in character – Use of the verbs ‘may’ and ‘shall’: Held: User of the verbs ‘may’ and ‘shall’ in a statute not a sure index for determining whether such statute is mandatory or directory in character – Legislative intent to be gathered looking into other provisions of the enactment, which can throw light to guide one towards a proper determination – Although the legislature often uses ‘may’, ‘shall’ or ‘must’ interchangeably, ordinarily ‘may’, having an element of discretion, is directory whereas ‘shall’ and ‘must’ are used in the sense of a mandatory provision – It is the duty of the court to gather the real intention of the legislature by carefully analysing the entire statute, the section and the phrase/expression under consideration – Provision appearing to be directory in form could be mandatory in substance – Substance, rather than the form, being relevant, ultimately it is a matter of construction of the statute that is decisive – Interpretation must depend on the text and the context – Interpretation which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual would be best – Enactment has to be looked at as a whole and it needs to be discovered what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word means and whether it is designed to fit into the scheme of the entire enactment – While no part of statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation, statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place.
