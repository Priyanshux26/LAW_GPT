12. As per the stand taken by the appellant, the land in question is A being utilised for UER-II, which is connecting NH-1, NH-10 and NH-8 further connecting it to NH-2. The said project is of great public importance and has to be completed before 15.08.2023 in light of Amrit Mahotsav (75 years of Independence). This will help in de-congestion of Delhi. B 13. From the facts as are available on record, it is evident that Respondent no.1 was admittedly not the recorded owner of the land at time of acquisition thereof or pronouncement of Award by the Land Acquisition Collector. The amount of compensation was deposited with the Reference Court in term of Section 30/31 of the 1894 Act as the C same could not be paid to Respondent no.1. Hence, one of the conditions being satisfied, in our view the passed by the High Court cannot be legally sustained whereby the acquisition has been held to have lapsed in terms of Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act. 14. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the impugned D passed by the High Court is set aside. The Writ Petition filed by the Respondent no.1 in the High Court is dismissed. Ankit Gyan Appeal allowed.
