The complaint ought to have been examined and investigated by Rajasthan Police, but owing to the interim passed by this Court the investigation has not proceeded as such the petition deserves to be dismissed. We have also been taken through the relevant statutory provisions under the Cr.P.C. in particular Sections 300, 177, 461 and Article 22 of the Constitution of India by the counsel for the parties and further reliance has also been placed on the following judgements: (i). Prem Chand Singh vs. State of UP3 (ii). T.T. Antony vs. State of Kerala & Ors.4 (iii). Y. Abraham Ajith & Ors. vs. Inspector of Police, Chennai & Anr.5 3 (2020) 3 SCC 54 4 [2001] 3 SCR 942 : (2001) 6 SCC 181 5 [2004] Supp. 3 SCR 604 : (2004) 8 SCC 100 [2024] 5 S.C.R. 79 Parteek Bansal v. State of Rajasthan & Ors. The first two have been relied upon by the counsel for the appellant and the third by the counsel for the respondents. 7. Without going into these statutory provisions and the case laws relied upon by the parties, we are convinced that the impugned proceedings are nothing but an abuse of the process of law. It is not denied by the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 that they did not lodge complaint at Hisar. They also did not file an application withdrawing their complaint on the ground that it was wrongly filed here or that the said complaint may be transferred to Udaipur for investigation as the offence was committed at Udaipur. They allowed the investigating agency to continue to investigate in which their statements were also recorded. The respondent No.3 was a gazetted Police Officer at the relevant time and was also well aware of the laws, in particular the Cr.P.C. and the provisions thereto. Neither the complainant nor the victim entered the witness box before the Hisar Court allowing total wastage of the valuable time of the Court and the investigating agency. Merely because she was a Police Officer, she first managed to get an FIR lodged at Hisar through her father, and thereafter she moved to her hometown at Udaipur and got another complaint lodged by her father within a week. 8. The following admitted dates would be relevant to upset the finding of the High Court that the complaint at Udaipur was prior in point of time: (i). Complaint at Hisar is dated 10.10.2015. (ii). Complaint at Udaipur is dated 15.10.2015. (iii). FIR registered at Hisar is dated 17.10.2015 (iv). FIR registered at Udaipur is dated 01.11.2015. On what basis the High Court recorded the finding that the complaint at Udaipur was prior in point of time is not discernible from the above dates and is contrary to the records and the admitted facts. 9. It is also not in dispute that in the complaint lodged at Udaipur, the allegations were the same as in the complaint at Hisar and additionally it was stated in the complaint at Udaipur that the complainant had earlier lodged a complaint at Hisar.
